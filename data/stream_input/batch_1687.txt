B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to download...easy to play! Great for passing the time while waiting in line,traffic,dr, offices and in line to pick up kids at school!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love this app. I used to hate pinterest &amp; think it was stupid but once I got this app that changed. Instantly. &amp; hey! It's free! :]
B00933JL0A|3.0|Not a bad game to kill some time, however within 2 weeks of casual play I had unlocked all items.  It's a pretty standard resource management game, but lacks the military aspect of settlers which would add another dimension to gameplay.  An annoyance I found is trying to build near the edge of the map.  The confirmation icons often appear off the edge of the screen.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|This movie is horrible. The bad acting, singing, and the fact that it tries to be a musical make this a huge disappointment of a movie. Both my wife and I hated it. Not sure what all the hype was about but this movie was not worth my time.
B004XZR63M|5.0|This book is simply amazing. Think I learnt a lot and truly believe financial independence is just not a dream for he middle class. I also liked the fact that the book does not ask you to quit your day job but actually work smarter ..a means to an end not an end in itself though! Must read!!!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|This is the best these Indiana Jones movies have ever looked or sounded and I am blown away by the quality of this Blu-ray<br />boxset.  Worth every penny and then some.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I found myself getting engrossed in the main character's high school experience and story.  Throughout the book, you get more attached to Charlie, his friends and family.  This was a great vacation read and I've recommended it to several friends.
B007PP2J9I|5.0|Trojan Horse is a suspenseful novel centering on two computer security consultants caught in the middle of state-sponsored cyber terrorism. Having read a lot of science fiction that, as a friend would say, is \\"soft\\", i.e., not based on true science, I have really enjoyed reading Mark's foray into fiction based on some of the real computer science that is being used in cyber terrorist attacks. As a practicing software engineer, and one who has written code using Microsoft technologies for over twenty years, it has been a pleasure to see the guy behind SysInternals turn out such suspenseful and readable novels.<br /><br />I actually couldn't put the book down as the suspense built. The main characters, Jeff Aiken and Daryl Haugen, were as expected from reading Mark's first novel, Zero Day. The new characters were portrayed I thought pretty well, without resort to obvious stereotypes. There were also some surprising revelations as the book progressed. Well done!<br /><br />The reason I gave the book five stars is partially because the author employed some realistic scenarios so that he can raise awareness of the threat to our civilized and everyday life that cyber-terrorism imposes. I follow a number of security researchers and technologists, including Mark, on Twitter, and through this medium, learn a lot about the holes in our online infrastructure. Getting the word out that our standard of living is threatened through cyber-terrorism is a great result of the publication of this book.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Definitely loved the second book as much as the first. Would recommend. Fun and exciting read! Can't wait for the next one!
B00006ZXSK|5.0|I bought this movie after not seeing it for years, and it is just as good now as it was when I was younger.  This movie is perfect in practically every way.  And this is coming from a girl who does not usually like girly movies.  This movie gets me every time.
B002RI9ZQ8|4.0|The book captures the dichotomy between old conservative Sweden and its grand old families and the new modern country. In the book the main character is a journalist on a search for truth and high standards in his profession as a business reporter. He is a maverick amongst his peers in that he does not just repeat the propaganda being touted by major banks and investment houses. In so doing he falls foul of a major business man (one of the new breed of self made business tycoons) and loses his job. Facing time in prison for gross libel he is surprised at the turn his life takes when he ends up trying to solve a 40 year old disappearance of a member of one of the old business families. The teaser is that this may give him ammunition to clear his name. Along the way he hooks up with the girl with the dragon tatoo. She is young and pretty but obviously psychologically damaged. Nevertheless she is an investigator with abilities way beyond others in her profession.<br /><br />The plot is complex but well constructed. The ending may appear predictable but the path the story follows is anything but predictable.<br />Overall a very good read and difficult to put down.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This was the greatest film ever!  At first when I saw the part one of deathly hallows, I didn't see how they were possibly going to top it, but they did.  This movie was well done, well acted and all around five stars.  Also, I did not think I was ever going to like another harry potter movie as much as Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of fire, but this one was great.  I hope people don't think i'm strange for liking those three the most, because I loved them!  My only beef with Goblet of fire was that it should have been a two parter.  I felt that the last four books of this series should have been two parters like the 7th one.  Call me a hopeless harry potter geek, but if that were the case, and the last four were two parters, (as opposed to just the last one) then the harry potter movies would still be in theaters, and I kind of miss that they are over.
B008NABUU8|5.0|Samsung giii -  runs with no problems.  I am really enjoying this beautiful game. I have played a bridge game before.  This one has its similarities, but is better.<br /><br />I've made it to bridge 7 without too much difficulty yet.<br /><br />You'll notice that those who are giving 1-2 stars are having trouble getting it to run on their devices.  Or possibly can't build a bridge. But if you can run it there's really no question that its a solid 5 star.
B000W746GK|5.0|I think this movie gets a bad rap!  People are always saying the first two harry potter movies are awful, but I like this one alot!  Even with the latest harry potter movies out, i still watch this one!  And the first movie just did not have the budget that was needed for a film like that.  That's all it was!  They did not get the money they needed!  So stop dissing Chris Columbus because he showed with this movie, that he had a very good vision.  This is still one of my favorites of the movies.
B0031RS8UI|4.0|What a surprise! The book started off as almost unbelievable that someone could change their life so dastically overnight, but turned into a great read and a good story.<br />Sophie writes beautifully and makes it easy to read.
B000EHSVQE|5.0|It took me till I was 26 years old to appreciate this movie.  When I saw it in college, I found it amusing, but I didn't see what all the hype was about.  But now, watching it as an older person, I see that this movie is a work of genius.  Thumbs up!
B00913DPW2|5.0|The graphics are beautiful.  The music is eerie.  The puzzles are HARD!<br />... At least there is plenty of help given online.  I like the fact that there are so many things to do before you are actually finished -- like the 99 piece jigsaw puzzle.<br />In fact, I liked The Haunt so much, I paid for it 3 separate times on 3 different devices!  One of the few games I like better on Android and Fire than iPad.<br /><br />EDIT: To WendyC & others who got stuck on 1 particular puzzle -- You can go to  SETTINGS and turn on the SKIP button.  I had to for the tile puzzles; those slide puzzles have always been my downfall!
B009A3NGF4|5.0|There are rollicking up-tempo songs, and gorgeous quieter songs, but they are all folksy and perfect! And I'm glad I got the Deluxe edition because the The Boxer cover is awesome.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I'm very happy with this cover it is just as described I have 3 covers and this odds my favorite it had adds the least bulk good deal for the price
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is beautifully written, telling a story from the perspective of multiple characters. It causes you to rethink what it means to be kind to a stranger and to explore the importance of beauty in the way we treat others. It's an easy, fascinating read that I would recommend to any age
B007C7UZIG|3.0|Maybe add in community hubs or something.  Right now there isn't much reason to use this app aside from checking out deals.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I was diagnosed with a wheat allergy many years ago and the cycle of craving and then feeling bad/tired and hurting in all my joints is exactly as he states. Since starting this book 3 weeks ago I have lost 8 lbs and I feel so much better in my joints and not nearly as run down and tired. I just started by avoiding everything that \\"screams wheat\\" like breads and pasta as well as nearly every dessert you can think of. It is not easy but if you will just start with the things that are totally obvious as being wheat products and keep a jar of peanuts or any other nuts or protein snack on hand it will help you make the transition. It is worth the effort. My wheat allergy also exhibited itself in dizziness problems when I have an excessive amount so over the years I learned when to stop to avoid that but still was hurting myself with weight gain and joint pain. It is not worth it just to have cookies and cake in your diet.  Let fruits be your sweet items. Substitute rice for pasta when you have spaghetti. Start somewhere and see if you don't feel the difference.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|rovio angry birds and whatever the heck your doing needs to DIE and by the way it IS NOT THE NEXT MARIO!!!
B007WDPPK8|4.0|the instructions are very easy to follow. there are lots of clear picturres which help a lot .i am sure i will be using this book a lot
B008NABUU8|4.0|Excellent Bridge Building app.  Awesome 3D Graphics and you can PAN and ZOOM to suite your taste.  The Controls work SMOOTHLY but placement and locking-in building materials can be a little quirky.  Fortunately, there is a REDO Button or you can Double Tap to Remove items.  The PHYSICS are Excellent and Realistic.  Compared to a half dozen similar apps I have tried, this is the Best.  Music and Sounds are OK.  If you like Physics games, you may LOVE this one.  It is LAGGY when changing scenes but not during building process.  Addons Detector shows OpenFeint on this app but it may have been disabled since I see no sign of it so far.  I see NO serious Problems or  Annoyances so I would definitely Recommend this well designed app.

B0098VYKSA|3.0|I am not a Kristen Stewart fan, and this movie didn't change that, but Cherize Theron is a wonderful villain.
B007SGM084|5.0|To all the housewives and females out there who are thinking about purchasing the Fifty Shades Trilogy Bundle...DO IT!!!!!!  They are by far the best books I have ever read. I can't get enough and am pleading for the author to continue to write more and more there is so much more she can write about!!  Best purchase ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I love love love Patricia Cornwell's writing, specifically the Scarpetta series.  Unfortunately, the last couple of novels have left me wanting.  The reason I have always loved her writing is the characters and her development of them, but that is where the last few books have been lacking.  Sentence structure in this one in particular is hard to follow.  Don't get me wrong, I respect her writing and will most likely always buy her books every time they are released, but lately it has been a little disappointing for a true fan.
B007WV05GY|3.0|This movie starts slow, but once it gets going, it is pretty good.  The wolf action is the best.  I have watched the last scene a few times over and it is a very poignant moment.
B009GLHF5C|4.0|Though it's not quite as hit-packed as their previous release The Resistance, there are still many good tracks on this record, and their attention to detail in both the lyrics and the music production remain top-notch. I do wish they'd chosen not to include the terrible non-Bellamy-sung tracks as they're just filler, and obviously were only included to keep the other band members happy. Bellamy is clearly the main driving creative force behind this band and they should just stick with him -- though it is a good sign that he was willing to step aside for a couple of songs. For me, standout tracks include \\"Supremacy\\" and \\"Panic Station,\\" though \\"Follow Me\\" is also great too!<br /><br />Overall, I'd give this record a score of 80 out of 100. Still excited to see them live in NJ next year! Their live shows are not to be missed - great stuff!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book. More realistic than a similar book, which I still love. I am patiently awaiting more. Good and quick read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This last book in the trilogy was the best to me.  I love the love story that the characters have worked toward.  Great read
B006WZIETG|5.0|I have been looking for this on Blu-ray and so happy I found it. I loved this movie when I was a kid, and my kids love it now!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can't wait to read the third book. I am dying to know what is in store for these two.
B008LY9AWG|3.0|Much of this was already previously published in Harry Bosch novels previously, many of which I already had. I really don't much care for compendiums not specifically identified as to series/full books already published.
B002CYUJGW|5.0|Really enjoyed this last in the series.  Brought all the stories to a nice ending and was great reading.  Sorry to say it is the last book in this series.
B001N3GUIE|4.0|This is a wonderful film in the best remastered quality. Plus you get to see all of \\"Robby the Robots\\" guest appearances of merit after this film.  The collectable character was sweet as well, and the Lobby Cards set it apart.  My only problem from a \\"5 Star\\", is totally an \\"Amazon Problem\\" and not a \\"Product Problem\\". The collectable tin that my set came in looks like someone at the \\"Fulfillment Center\\" had \\"drop kicked\\" it...or at least dropped it, and I was able to \\"pull out the dent\\", but it is far from \\"mint\\" and \\"collectable\\" condition. So the value of the tin is worthless, but at least nothing in the tin was damaged in any way.
B00005JCAA|1.0|[revised 10/30/2012]<br /><br />If an award is ever given for the most-tedious film of all time, \\"Meet Joe Black\\" stands a good chance of winning.<br /><br />The script is poor. A good screenwriter knows that most characters have secrets and lie about them -- and builds dialog around this. (Joe Black has a secret of cosmic significance.) Goldman & Wade don't seem to understand this, and too many scenes meander without developing any interesting tension. If there's anything worse than actors standing around talking, it's actors standing around not saying anything in particular.<br /><br />It's possible the 3-hour version \\"works\\" in a way that the 2-hour version doesn't. If it does, I'll revise this review.<br /><br />--------------------<br /><br />In my original review, I recommended the Frederic March original as superior. I watched it for a second time last night, and it was not the film I remembered. For most of its run time, it plays as an off-kilter comedy (it was directed by Mitchell Leisen), getting serious only in the last 25 minutes. It suffers from being a speculation on something no one has direct knowledge of -- the nature of death and the afterlife (if any). Its most-serious weakness is its failure to explore the relationship between Death and Grazia throughout the story, rather than leaving it until the last few minutes. Someone must have looked at the 1934 script, decided \\"We can do better\\", and \\"Meet Joe Black\\" was the result. (My only memory of the 1971 TV version is that Monte Markham made a handsome Death.)<br /><br />I have to disavow my praise of the special effect that ends the film. It's no more than an early version of the transporter effect in the original \\"Star Trek\\". It's incomprehensible that I could have remembered it as something that left my jaw on the floor. I apologize.
B008BSPQ3E|3.0|Where are all the B-Sides and alternate mixes? Couldn't the live stuff be marketed separately? And finally, my biggest problem with this package is a familiar issue with many immersion sets of late, AND I finally have a solution! Here it goes:<br /><br />It's called \\"Build Your Own Box\\". It would be a several step process on the artists' page of selecting the content you want AND on the media that you want it on, not unlike building your own PC at Dell. It's really quite simple; Do you want vinyl or CD? Do you prefer Blu-ray or DVD? The only redeeming quality here is that you are given a 24 bit download code for ALL of the audio in the box.<br /><br />A lot of work went in to the DNA CD so props for that. Though it would have been nice for some full alternate takes or demos. I can't express my disappointment enough with the exclusion of B-Sides (Curtains, Walk Through The Fire, Across The River, Don't Break This Rhythm, Ga-Ga I Go Swimming) and alternate mixes, especially the special extended mix of In Your Eyes which to my knowledge has never been released on CD, only vinyl. They could have even included Out Out from the Gremlins soundtrack which came out around the same time.<br /><br />Finally, live stuff is great but had this live stuff been sold separate (and on Blu-ray), it would have freed up more space for studio stuff which, I believe, the really hardcore fans wanted. Half the content here is live. It should have been called \\"So/Live 25\\".<br /><br />As someone who has been a big fan of PG since my youth, I'd really love to hear what others think about this set. Are you as disappointed as I am?
1416562605|5.0|Add Aravind Adiga to the long list of talented writers of Indian (Rohinton Mistry, Arundhati Roy), Pakistani (Mohsim Hamid) or Sri Lankan (Michael Ondaatje) ethnicity  who have enriched the English literary scene. \\"The White Tiger\\" was the 2008 Man Booker award winner and deservedly so. Energetic, off beat, amoral yet moral at the same time, it captures the poverty, energy and graft of modern day India better than any newspaper report, better than any travel guide. Adiga's clever story structure and his breezy conversational tone make this a joy to read even though his hero's crime is decapitating his kind and considerate master.  I look forward to reading his other books.
0525958002|4.0|John does a great job telling his story - both in the way he speaks it and the way it's written.  I guess my only gripe would be the way he glossed over Warren leaving the band.  I'm pretty sure Warren didn't \\"bow out gracefully\\" and given that I understood it to be that they were pretty good friends, it would've been nice to hear a little sadness or contrition about Warren leaving.  I firmly believe that Warren helped keep Duran alive for all the years he was with them and he doesn't get enough credit for that.<br /><br />That said, I did really enjoy this book and I'm happy John took the time to write it and share it w/all of us Duran fans.  Especially those, such as myself, who have been supporting them for the past three decades.  (Now I wouldn't mind if Simon and Nick took a stab at writing a book.)
B007QPFGJW|2.0|The story was unimaginative and dark. The characters weren't terribly interesting.<br />I kept reading thinking that it would become more exciting, intriguing, surprise me in some way, but I was disappointed. Too many good books to read to waste time on this one!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|amazon basics slr  camera  backpack..is very well made..100% satisfied..all kinds of nice compartments..very well padded to protect your camera..would buy again!
B004SDEP38|5.0|When I first downloaded the apparently, I really didn't know how useful it would come to be. Ihave had the apparently now for less than a month, and I find myself using it Everest. It is almost like having an office at my finger tips. I Would say that it was a worthy buy at an affordable cost and it will be utilized for quite some time. I haven't even scratched the surface with all of its features yet! If you are looking for something to upgrade your android, or make school or work more portable, then I definitely recommend this apparently.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Although this series is mildly entertaining and certainly fantasy-inspiring for the sexually frustrated, it sets women's rights back fifty years.  If you can \\"cock your head to the one side\\", if you beleve that a single person obsessed and infatuated with you is really \\"love\\", if you think marriage is about being possessed, and if you believe in the possibility of a 28 year old man who can be self-assured enough to make a billion dollars yet be vulnerable and needy, this is the book for you.  But good luck:  your future is going to be a rocky roller coaster of failed relationships.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is the tale of a marriage gone badly.  Told from diary entries of the husband and the wife, we get a glimpse of just how differently two people can perceive the same set of facts. The diary entries of the wife - who goes missing early in the book - are particularly compelling.  Don't let anyone tell you any more about this book and go read it.  It's suspenseful, interesting, and in the end, you realize that you understand a little more about evil.

B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Great app. Very useful. Needs to be simpler to use though. I think it should include the editing functions available on the website, like being able to delete a notebook.

B00943SQCI|3.0|Well, I love Johnny Depp movies and couldn't wait to see this. But, sadly I have to say that I was disappointed. I have tried to watch it three times and all three times I fell asleep. It is very slow to start the actual story and kind of boring for a Johnny Depp movie. I will try to watch it again, maybe the story picks up better later on in the movie...hopefully :(
B007SSEU9O|3.0|Streep was wonderfully convincing, but the movie as a whole was disappointing.  All about iron, little  about ore.  Not enough about about the source of her policies - the reasons for her actions.  Essentially nothing about her relations with Reagan, e.g.  Way too much about her visions/dementia in later life - rather depressing, even with the stiff upper lip at the end.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|This a good all around family movie. Our whole family enjoyed it and this is one you can perchase and watch several times. It is worth the money.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Works well. I like to wake up to my favorite songs. The math problems help keep me honest when I'm really tired, and would rather sleep in.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book was pretty good.  I don't usually read romance novels but picked this up because it was so popular.  The book is a love story about the mentally ill.  I kept reading the book to learn more about why the main characters are who they are. I also bought book 2 based on the recommendations of friends, but I am not sure if I will buy book 3.

B008XNZMOU|2.0|For a while it seemed that Taylor Swift could do no wrong. Even those who were not swayed by her honest-to-heels girliness have to admit that she creates captivating popular songs, with each album outshining the last one. Swift would even prove her doubters who would claim that \\"third time is rarely the charm\\" false when she came up with her best-to-date album Speak Now, which, like Fearless, is laced with big-girl wisdom that anyone can nod his/her head to. But this time around it seems that she has finally gone out of fuel. Her latest album, boldly named Red, is an abysmal effort at best, creating a vast change of style that surrendered to the mainstream bubble-gum pop princess pop, with an infantile attitude and horrendously little-girly lyrics. Those of us who are curious and hopeful of how Swift will grow as an artist will be terribly disappointed: Swift has not grown with her 4th album but shrank, or more explicitly, aging backwards; Her songs are now for 13-year-old girls (or younger) and anyone else who is willing to throw up her hands and say \\"awww how cute!\\"<br />The trouble immediately started with her first single We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together. The title of the song is already bad enough, but one must give Taylor Swift the benefit of the doubt, after all, one of the songs on her last (deluxe) album is called If This Was A Movie and it turned out to be a beautiful, heart-felt song (and one of my favorite from her). This time however, luck has ran out; it was even worse than I could've ever imagined. How bad? Well, let's just say that it is only remotely better than Rebecca Black's viral Friday, but unlike Rebecca Black, she cannot plead lack of experience or young age. It is a song that is entirely devoid of any poetic elements and consist of simply girly talk. At one point she even croons: \\"I say, `I hate you,' we break up, you call me, `I love you.'\\" An accurate parody of the song can be thus: \\"Oh so I told you the other day, I called him up,and he was like: `can we make up?' and I was like: `no way' and he was like `please' and we ended up in like, this restaurant, and then he said something that I didn't like, so I was like: we are never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever getting back together again. And he was like `whaaaat?' and I was like \\"yep.\\" I have no doubt that this song has the potential to sell very well. After all, just how many times can one over-estimate the American audience anyways?<br />The phrasing of most of the rest of her songs are the worst I've heard of Taylor Swift so far. The album is entirely filled of nauseating bleeps like \\"RE-E-E-E-E-D\\" and \\"Me-e-e-e-e-e\\" that went along her usual chick-self-victimizing lyrics that, unlike the last couple of albums, lacked any kind of depth or insight that can appeal to a mature brain, thus they are no longer charming but annoyingly ego-centric that can be characterized as those that came from the mouth of a popular and pouty teenage cheerleader. While any songs on Red that actually sound tad-bit more mature consist of boring tunes that fell out of any grace that Taylor Swift had with her past strong ballades such as Dear John or Back to December. Even worse move was to invite other (male) singers to collaborate songs with her. Normally we listen to Swift's album and because it is recorded in a studio, we forget the fact that Swift is very weak vocally, but now, with other singers, the difference is painfully acknowledged. Especially The Last Time in which she sang with Gary Lightbody of Snow Patrol. Lightbody essentially owned the song, out-reflect Swift's squeaking like she is a timid sing-along audience in the background.<br />There has always been arguments of Swift's genre: whether she can be considered country or just pop. And it didn't matter because she was good at what she does. But now, with this album, who can really say that she's still country? Her album isn't even good pop. Perhaps she should think twice before working with a bunch of song-writers for bubble-gum pop and return to do everything by herself, or work with better musicians (her best new song has been Safe and Sound with Civil Wars, many people who heard that song doubted that Swift had any major writing, and they are justified in their skepticism-she is clearly not on that level yet) A word of advice for Taylor Swift is that before she does, she should slow down and take a good look around her. Being ego-centric and aggressively victimizing oneself may have their charms for a while, but too much of something is rarely a good thing. Because the truth of matter is, the world is composed of much bigger things than her.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|I loved this book really sucks you in i read this book in 3days:) getting ready to start the next one ! Hoping it is just as good as this one was if not better!
0307730697|3.0|I do not have much non-Hollywood knowledge of military procedures, training, or personnel. When I had the opportunity to read \\"Fearless,\\" I jumped at getting a deeper look at both Adam Brown's story and the making of a successful operator. Eric Blehm wove the story, interlaced with quotes and reactions from both family and team members, into short snippets which made for easy quick readings or enthralling longer stints. Honestly, I couldn't even tell you how many chapters the book contains. When I read the pages, I was easily transformed into a one-way observation perch in which I could see every horror, honor, and emotion of Adam Brown's life.<br /><br />I can't put my finger on it, but I was not enticed to read the book quickly. By the time I arrived at the last chapter of Adam's story, though, I couldn't put the book down. I can only attribute my unconscious slowness to the reason the book is written from a narrator's perspective; I did not want to rush to the end of the story.<br /><br />By reading the chapters \\"Unconquerable Soul,\\" Epilogue, and Afterword, all of the comments about Brown are confirmed as to the godly man he was to the thousands of people who had the opportunity to meet him. It is clear that God used him in many ways to not only preserve national and international freedom, but to embody what He can do through a broken man.<br /><br />My only qualm about highly recommending this book is the foul language in some of the quotes. F-words are replaced with dashes, but the other choice words could have been omitted for a more powerful story. As it is written, and due to the content and details, this book is for adults.<br /><br />I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.
0525952926|5.0|I loved Fall of Giants, but I liked Winter of the World even more.  It is long - be prepared to be consumed by this novel.  I learned so much about WW II while reading this book.  I recommend it for those history buffs out there.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This by far is the BEST book i've read. After i read the 1st i knew i had to get the 2nd and 3rd book, im even going to reread the entire trilogy after i finish the 3rd book. i would def recommend this book to everyone!!
B008OB1QFK|5.0|It's hard to believe it's almost 15 years since Chris' debut lp came out on Decca. He is actually the last new artist I've gotten excited about and I always look forward to his new recordings. Nothing is as great as that first cd (producer Frank Liddell has gone on to mega success with Miranda Lambert)but I really thought Chris gave all he got on that first cd and he'd be fading out. 14 years and about 9 cds later I love 'Little Victories.' All eleven songs aren't stellar but most are. I keep playing the first four cuts over again and they are certainly worth the cd price. Buddy Miller plays on the first two cuts and the guitar work particularly on \\"Missing You' is just equisite. I am hoping there will be more collaboration between the two and more participation of Knight in Americana Music Assn.  activities because every year I find less music that gets me excited like this cd does.<br />John Prine also joins on another song.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Fantastic super hero film. This US Paramount title is uncut compared with its UK Disney counterpart. Question is: is it woth paying an extra £11.73 Customs - just to see the tip of an arrow pierce a body? Too right it is......I hate cut films.
B00846REIS|3.0|The character development was very good and the storyline very readable, but the crudeness of the language was completely unnecesary and ruined the story for me.  The Fifty Shades of Gray Trilogy was much more elegantly told.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Smart comedy ... Really funny. The characters are hilarious. Can't stop watching the episodes ! I laugh every time.<br />Great buy !

B006LSZECO|4.0|I just finished this novel and have to say 'I LOVED IT!' I won't go on and on, like some of the disappointed reviewers, on how 'unreal' the plot was, etc. etc. It's a WORK OF FICTION, people, get over it. Of course it's crazy, unbelievable, and far fetched! That's what makes it so good. No one, in their right mind, would end up in this situation. That's a given. \\"Duh!\\" But the characters, in this book, are far from normal/sane. They make the 'War of the Roses' look like a Sunday evening church social. Amazing Amy is a whack job, folks! And, if you ask me, Nick (her husband) is just as cray-cray in the membrane. More so, maybe.<br /><br />Yes, the plot is nuts. It's hard to believe. And it's NEVER going to happen in real life. But that is exactly why this book is such a good read. Can you imagine being stuck, for life, with a person you hate with every fiber in your body. A person you can't trust. A person you don't feel comfortable sleeping with because you fear they might send you to Jesus during your restless slumber. Come on, haters, this book was enjoyable. Why does everything have to 'make sense'?? Our government doesn't make any 'sense' either--yet we still vote for the mofos! Lighten up. 'Gone Girl' is a NUTTY good time. So find a comfy chair, slip on your readers, and enjoy the AMAZING ride Gillian Flynn has in store for you. You won't believe it.
1455121924|3.0|Good book to help you understand how you need to change your eating habits for long, healthy living. I also recommend using along with a food combination chart.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|It's an entertaining movie to watch on a Friday night. As long as you start the movie without big expectation. It worths the rental price.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love spider solitaire and this game is so much fun to play. It downloaded easily. The only bad part is that between hands it tries to entice you to download other games.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|This is a great classical novel. I enjoyed it very much and I am certainly looking forward to keep reading Wilde's works.
B002GHIPYI|2.0|I was stoked to receive these headphones after reading all of the great testemonials about it. The headphones came nicely packaged and even came with a Lux bag, which was nice. The quality sounds fine but the left speaker came with the foam pulled out and has faint audio coming from it. The headphones are more right-side audio than anything else. Pretty upsetting basing everything off of stellar reviews and great presentation upon arrival.
B002SS8S7E|4.0|I felt that this movie depicted the Dark Knight as he should have been in previous attempts. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and will probably watch it several more times.
B009CPE424|5.0|I HAVE THE OTHER TWO WILL GET THIS ONE WHEN THE PRISE IS DOWN ON IT THANKS ALOT LOVED IT.
B000067IZ3|5.0|I had to watch it for class.  Dvd was perfect and worked great. Interesting movie.  Didn't skip at all.  Got me through the class.
B00632HWOG|3.0|It is easy to use and I like that I don't have to get on my Pc to check the mail
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I started reading this with a hefty amount of skepticism.  After reading the first few pages i was hooked.  A compelling and unique storyline along with nice character development made it hard to put down.  I now will be compelled to read the rest of the series.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Fifty Shades of Freed is an Excellent piece of work and a most wonderful last segment to a great Trilogy!!!
B004Y6MU6S|5.0|Only once before I've enjoyed a book to the degree that I had to read it twice. The first one was \\"The Name of the Wind, by Patric Rothfuss\\", a book that left works by Martin, Tolkien and erikson taste like dust. And up to this day (after 20 years of reading fantasy) The Name of the Wind found it's competitioner on the gold pedestal of the best fantasy book written, ever.<br /><br />If, u liked books like:<br />The farseer trilogy (Hobb)<br />The name of the Wind (Rothfuss)<br />The Nightangel trilogy (Weeks)<br />Demon cycle (Brett)<br />Mistborn or Elantris (Sanderson)<br />Wheel of time (Jordan)<br /><br />You will love this one, and perhaps re-read it like me. If your taste in fantasy is more gray and oriented for \\"realistic\\" and \\"gritty\\" fantasy and you find Abercrombie, Martin and Cook to be your favourite authors, you might dislike this book- , or not find it as a \\"turning point\\" in fantasy literature.<br /><br />// A dedicated fantasy reader and student of psychology.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this completed Trilogy Fifty Shades Darker was an extremely great read i recommend highly the complete set! Way to Go E.L. James!
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|I did not see this movie in theaters after hearing it did not do well when it opened.  But I was surprisingly entertained by this very imaginative movie.  Not sure why it didn't do so well in theaters, but I really enjoyed it.

B003F3FJQO|4.0|i wasn't sure i was going to like it , i read the first book and it was alright and i was curious to see if the second book would be any better and it was. i have now started the third book and i hope this one is just as good if not better

B008ODZEQ0|5.0|Simply amazing in-depth look into how sushi should be. A rarified position in today's world of over commercialized fishing and mass market sushi.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|By far this is the best Halo live action vid produced by far. However, I'd go so far as to say it's the best Sci-Fi mini series ever produced. With special effects on par with TV and even movie quality, you won't be disappointed. The acting is strong and believable. There's just enough character development to understand what the major players are about. And then of course there is Master Chief. Daniel Cudmore plays the physical Master Chief and does a masterful performance. Director Stewart Hendler (Sorority Row, Whisper) gets the most from his actors throughout the series. I never felt like anyone was overacting, nor not given their all. A great balance.<br />Halo fans, do yourselves a HUGE favor and buy this.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|Plantronics is the best.  And they have best customer service ever.  Professional efficient.  Everytime I have called them they are very very professional

B005544WWS|5.0|I discovered this program just this year.  So I wanted to catch up on the programs that I missed and bought the first year to watch.  It is wonderful!  I love having the ability to watch programs or movies through Amazon's Prime program.  It is convenient and cheap!

B006Z7Z3S6|5.0|Quaint, enchanting, cute - these aren't words normally associated with films about a haunting, but they are more than apt for describing The Innkeepers.  If you're wondering if this can even be considered a horror movie, I can assure you that it does earn its horror chops when all is said and done (although I think the trailer oversells the scare factor).  What I took away from the movie, though, was a rather poignant sense of melancholy.  You aren't going to find many horror films that run you through such a gamut of emotions as this one.  It's an unconventional but really impressive piece of work from writer/director Ti West.<br /><br />The setting is the historic Yankee Pedlar Inn, on the final weekend before it closes its doors forever.  With only one floor open and three rooms booked, young Claire (Sara Paxton) and Luke (Pat Healy) are all the only employees left to see the inn through its final days and hours.  Their focus, however, is in trying to prove that the venerable old hotel is indeed haunted - supposedly by the ghost of Madeline O'Malley, a young bride who reportedly hanged herself when her lover abandoned her on her wedding day.  Luke has created a web site about sightings of the ghost, but it is Claire who seems fixated on making contact with Madeline before the inn closes its doors forever.  Claire is quite a character - young, unfocused, highly excitable, and just incredibly cute.  She definitely doesn't seem to have the temperament of a ghost hunter, as several comical scenes early on make clear.  Personally, I found her infatuating, and I thought Sara Paxton's portrayal of her was almost magical.  Kelly McGillis also turns in a strong performance as actress turned new age healer Leanne Rease-Jones, a character who comes to play a crucial and prophetic part in the story.<br /><br />The Innkeepers is devilishly hard to describe.  In a way, much of the story is predictable, yet at the same time it's also rather shocking in the end.  The writing is subtly brilliant.  The significance of some lines early in the movie only hit you later on, even after the film is over.  It sounds stupid for me to describe the story as both conventional and unconventional, but I think that is a true statement.  Those who like their scares blatant and numerous probably won't like the film, as it's really not a scarefest.  The Innkeepers is a ghost story in the traditional sense, full of subtle nuance and dare I say intellect, playing out in a little world where the characters are more important than the events that befall them.  I loved it.subtly brilliant.  The significance of some lines early in the movie only hit you later on, even after the film is over.

B007MNV5WU|4.0|another good game from Rovio.  I was introduced to this game by a friend. I wasn't initially going to get it as I thought it would be little different from the other 'angry birds' themes.  But if your like me and get addicted to playing to get three stars before moving on this can be quite a challenge. Very enjoyable 'time killer'
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I like that I can compete against myself by tring to improve my scores &amp; against others.  The graphics are good and the music is (as others have said) soothing  Definitely a keeper.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This video has 3 different 20 min workouts.  They advance in level.  I have only done level 1, but it was fast paced and I felt like I got in a good workout.  Jillian is tough but I love the way she explains everything and gives you a reason why.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|One of the best in Marvel's Phase One and its genre. Excellent work. One of the best/funniest Stan Lee cameos, too.
630589938X|5.0|Ok,  I have read a lot of griping about how the book was soooo much better.  With all do respect we are not reviewing the book we are reviewing the movie. Cujo is a classic horror film in every sense of the word.  Terrifying, intelligent, realistic and ultimately unforgettable.  I wont go into the plot of the movie due to the fact that others already have quite well.  I would like to write about how I feel that Cujo is an underrated movie that does not get the credit it deserves.  I have noticed that a lot of individuals have complained about it being to slow and how it takes to long before the horror sets in.  This is called build up folks.  this is called character development.  The characters in this film are very believable.  There is not a bad performance to be found.  King himself said that Dee Wallace gave the best performance of any character he has ever written adapted to the screen.  That is a pretty huge statement considering how many memorable performances different actors have given in his movies, (Kathy Bates in Misery anyone).  Cujo himself is one of the all time movie villains.  An enormous mangy, slobbering, growling force of nature that would keep any sane human being locked in thier car until help came.  The special effects are top notch, especially considering the time it was made.  Cujo is a heavily atmospheric film as well.  The misty landscapes, setting suns and moody score really contribute to its overall tone.  There is such a palpable sense of helplessness you feel for the victims.  The movie never sales itself short or succumbs to over sentimentality.  It is a pretty gritty rollercoaster ride of a movie that manages to be genuinaly suspenseful.  When the credits role the viewer feels both drained and hyper do to the intense situation they were forced to view.  Anyone for a penchant for smart scary movies would be well advised to see this unforgettable 80's classic.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One if the best books that i have read in a long time.  i cant wait to read the other ones .
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|great game. I like all the little extras you get in the game. some levels are pretty challenging. keep up the good work
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really loved this book.  The story line between Eva and Gideon is great.  I am looking forward to the next book in the series and hoping that Gideon and Eva's relationship will endure.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved learning more about Eva and Giddeon and their twisted past in the second book.  I cannot wait to see how things continue to develop in book three.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. it good very little problems. I spend hours on here just looking at interesting things and re pinning them.
B0091REZMW|3.0|really just started so i don't  understand totally just yet still playing<br />I'm sure I'll get the hang of it
B000BI0WOA|5.0|Excellent quality audio, the CDs tracklist is the same of the preview on the site !!! I recommend it !!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Every man and woman should read these books. It is an outstanding love affair.  I have read them twice and will probably read them again.  You become part of the story, as if you are watching their relationship from above. It is extremely graphic, but somehow that part of the story line becomes less important than the developing love affair between two young people.
B009FOBMBI|4.0|TDG continues to deliver. Great album! Nothing jumps out as \\"best song\\" but the entire album is solid. Especially like the \\"Give In To Me\\" cover.
B007TK77QE|4.0|I saw a TV interview with Miss Rawlings and was interested to see what type of adult book she had written. From the interview I just decided to try the \\"sample\\" but ended up purchasing the full book.  It was a terrific read.  I was interested in the chararcters but must admit found it a little hard to keep up with who was who but in the end it all came together well.  I have told my friends and family about it and recommended they read it.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|And this does not disappoint.This album is exactly what I had in mind as I awaited another release from Pink. LOVE HER.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read Bared to You, as soon as I was finished the 50 Shades of Grey Trilogy, and I must say as much as I loved those characters, I love Eva and Gideon even more. They are both so incredibly damaged. I love the love story, and CANNOT wait for the next book in this series! If you loved 50 Shades of Grey you will devour this series, and be left wanting more.
B009KUANWG|5.0|Personally, I think this is the best James Bond theme/promotion song since Die Another Day by Madonna. Skyfall is different from her previous work. In a way it's almost like the lyrics are telling the listener to never lose their cool or give up. Not in a poppy, club like way or whatever (don't worry Ke$ha, you're still cool to me) but with a firm, calm voice. I even like the orchestra too. They seem to have gotten the James Bond-ish feel with the orchestra (at least in the beginning of the song). If Adele were to ever make a video for this, that would be kind of awesome. Adele singing in a James Bond suit.<br /><br />All in all, this is worthy of a James Bond theme song. Away from the breakup songs from her 21 album.<br /><br />I give this a 9.5 out of 10 (if she didn't repeat the chorus numerous times I'd give it a perfect 10 out of 10 but this is still a good song).
B0078X2LKY|5.0|The only fault I find with this book is that it's so short. My boys are probably at or above the upper level of the age range for this book (7 & 8 yrs), but they still giggled away through the whole book, and have asked me to read it again. That's high praise for us book-eaters! ;)
B005ILYWN2|5.0|This movie is obviously camp after the first Troll scene, but kept my attention and curiosity just the same all the way through. It is an extremely-well-done film, with lots of creative touches and lore and great camerawork. The actor for the hunter is perfect. I'm not any kind of mockumentary enthusiast but if there are more like this added to the genre it will be a great thing.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I was alittle apprehensive when I first started reading the book on whether I would like it or not. But by the end of the first chapter, I was hooked.  What a great story that is well written.  I didn't want to put the book down.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I'm absolutely in love with this series. I'm almost finished with this second book 50 Shades of Darker (about 50 pages left). I've recommended the series to many friends on the terms that Ana is whiny as all hell, and they use the term \\"inner goddess\\" WAY too often. Oh my! (*eye roll*) But it's MOST DEFINITELY a page turner with an awesome plot and I'm going to be sad when it's over. I lose myself in these books for sure.
0805028846|4.0|Exelente libro donde se explican de manera muy amena todas las tecnicas para desplegar este arte tan copado. Ademas el libro es de una edición impecable,tamaño bastante grande y páginas de ilustración que lo hacen muy atractivo.
B0053O89JM|4.0|the stories were not up to the usual standards. the last one was totally bizarre i didn't understand what the heck was going on.
B004M9ZI0M|5.0|This film was a visual feast and a thoroughly entertaining twist on the traditional Shakespearean Tempest. Very interesting, almost McQueen feel to costumes - will watch again and suggest to friends into historical type genre.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is very hard to get into.  In the beginning It keeps shifting charachters and is confusing.  I understand that once you get into the main story line where Amy disappears it is a very good read.  I have not reached that point yet but I am not discouraged, don't you be either.
0385341008|5.0|Very well written, full of interesting information concerning the occupation of Guernsey by the Nazis during<br />World War II!  These isolated people knew nothing of the outside world.  You will find this to be a quick read<br />done in an unusual format.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Moonrise Kingdom provides such a fun and quirky view of the world through the eyes of two 12 year old, love-struck children. The casting is brilliant.It is nice to see the softer side of Bruce Willis and Edward Norton. Bill Murray is a regular in Anderson's films and does a terrific job as Suzy's depressed father. The two children in the movie are fantastic and truly bring out the movie's beauty and look at first love. I loved this movie and plan on buying the DVD to add to my Anderson collection!!!
0525953728|5.0|Yeah, I was former ROK Army sgt. and I really really wanted to read about this kind of story.<br /><br />Of course he didn't to reveal any detail of his operation but this is so much welcomed because we, like ordinary people doesn't know about the fact about Kill Osama Bin Laden. Anyway, this book is awesome and I would like all US and Allies armed forces safely back home and have a peaceful mind.<br /><br />Thanks amazon and thanks for all their services for keeping freedom and peace.<br /><br />From Seoul, Korea<br />Jay Park.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Can't wait for last book and how their love may or may not  make it. will their past be their end?
B008NABUU8|5.0|my dad builds briges it is so cool fun fun fun fun fun fun cool cool cool cool cool cool
B008NABUU8|5.0|I have played quite a few games in the past few weeks, some good and some not so much. This is just just what I was looking for. More brains than brawn. You get to learn a little and test your wit,just plain fun. everything works well on my nexus 7 and no permission that should not be there. I highly recommend this game and hope to see more like it.
B000C13Y2S|2.0|I saw some reviews about it, I read some info...<br />But I am still dissapointed.<br /><br />When I tryed to open his legs, they broke. (they are not metal as shown on picture, they are made of some kind plactic)<br />Two legs broke even without forceing it to open.<br />Now I am using it as ordinar flashlight but still not as good as any other. Light flickers (2-3 times in 5 seconds) and has very short range.<br />Next time I will buy Larget Stanley tripod. Hope theyr quality is better.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Coin Dozer is a fun game and is a good game when you need an easy game to pass the time.
B004P1JDJO|5.0|Daniel Pink's book is very inspiring and gives a lot of high power, exceptionally well founded and game changing input to our believes as to what motivates us. Simply superb! A must read that I recomend to any one who has even the slightest interest in this topic. There is by the way an excellent You Tube video of it as well.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|I think I know why I missed out on this album back in the 70's.  We were all listening to something else, and this record was not promoted well enough.  Sixto's lyrics and guitar work are wonderful.  Whoever produced the recording may have thrown in a few too many \\"special effects\\" or \\"trippiness\\", but I am able to look past that on a couple of songs.<br />Other reviewers have mentioned that Sixto's  songs have a hint of Cat Stevens and/or Bob Dylan to them. I would also add Jim Croce.<br />Funny that it took an article in AARP magazine to tip me off to the existence of Sixto. (I missed the Letterman show the night he as on.)<br />The more I listen to this album the more I see it as a reflection of \\"male angst in the big city, circa 1970\\". Some of the lyrics and stylings are certainly \\"dated\\", but the feelings expressed ring true to those of us who lived it.<br />Now, at 70 years old, his music is finally being appreciated here in the U.S. and his concerts are selling out. He certainly deserves this commercial success that has eluded him for so many years.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|fun 3 match game. worth playing if you like that kind of game. story and bonus items add some extra fun but its basically a match three game at the end of it all.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was an amazing adventure reading this book. It took my breath away sometimes and made jump from my seat also. 100% recommended.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|If you like the tv show \\"Castle\\", you'll like this book. In the book, I read Nikki Heat, but I hear Beckett talking. Only thing I have a hard time adjusting to, in the book Castle is Jameson Rook (must be a chess fan)and he is as fun and cute as Castle. Anyway, it reads like an episode of Castle with all the twists, turns and fun that they bring to the screen each week. It's a way to get more Castle between tv shows.
B004YM6JK0|5.0|Supernatural continues to be one of the best series on TV.  The ups and downs of the Brothers combined with their continual struggle with the forces of darkness is forever entertaining.  I love the supporting characters, too.  It is always a shame when some have to go.  Nevertheless, a GREAT SERIES!!!
B008NABUU8|5.0|I dunno why but I really like this game. It's right up my ally even though I suck at it. I am currently stuck on bridge 3 coming up short of money to buy my last girder I need to make the bridge. Will have to work at it in the morning when I am not half asleep.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|amazingly time consuming! I always play this game when I have nothing better to do! which is a lot of the time
B0084I9QI2|5.0|I was very happy to receive my Deluxe Edition, Bad, 25th Anniversary boxed set in the mail. I threw the DVD of the 1988 Bad Concert in London into my DVD player and could not stop myself from smiling and loving every moment of watching the most beautiful performer and lovely man who ever stepped onto a stage. It was so fresh and so delicious to watch Michael in all of his glory back in the day at age 29 years old. Michael was electric and in your face and nobody else will ever entertain in that way to me or the world, in my opinion, ever again.<br /><br />The DVD video quality looked great! I had read that some people thought the video quality wasn't that good, but I didn't have that problem on my DVD player. Michael looked beautiful and the whole thing looked flawless to me.<br /><br />I looked at all the photos in the booklets and again my heart smiled along with my face because I was so happy to have something I hadn't seen before in my hands of my forever favorite person and entertainer.<br /><br />I miss Michael and my heart will never heal from losing him from this life. Although, in my mind he still lives in the most beautiful spiritual way through all the fun memories I have of him and the love I have for him, it doesn't help that I have to remember that he is no longer here...it truly still hurts.<br /><br />I've watched the DVD about 2 times since I bought it and because it gets hard sometimes to watch I just listen to his songs. The songs that are added were quite interesting. I don't have a favorite because anything Michael, sounds wonderful.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I wasted 3 days on J.K. Rowling's newest book last week, and Kate Morton's book was just what I needed----interesting characters, plot twists, and story line, along with great character development....her writing is interesting, and so are her characters, and the thread of mystery that runs through her book makes it the type book you need to read on a rainy afternoon, when you want to just immerse yourself in the story and its characters.  Highly recommend it.
B009QW7HMC|5.0|This is a really good start to a new season.I am 50 years old and this is one of the best tv shows I have ever watched PERIOD, and I don't even like horror flicks. I am impressed.  The way this show is written just blows my mind. I have know problem putting my self right there with them fighting side by side and relating to everything going on around them and with them.<br />I can hardly wait for EP #2.
0307245314|4.0|Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson and the Olympians series begins with the premise that the gods and monsters of ancient Greek mythology are real...and, being immortal, still around today.  And they have moved with the \\"heart of the West\\", from Greece to Rome (where they had different names, but it was still the same gods), to France, Germany, and England for a while...and now they're in America, the center of Western civilization today.  Olympus is on the 600th floor of the Empire State Building in New York, and the gates of the Underworld are in Los Angeles.<br /><br />In The Lightning Thief, weird things keep happening to twelve-year-old Percy Jackson, and he eventually discovers that he's a \\"half-blood\\", fathered by one of the gods.  The \\"Big Three\\"---brothers Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades---made a pact not to father any more children with mortals after the second World War, which was basically a battle between the children of Zeus and Poseidon on the Allied side and the children of Hades on the Axis side.  But it seems that at least one of them has broken the pact.<br /><br />Worse, Zeus's \\"master bolt\\" has been stolen, and he suspects Percy is the thief.  So, with the help of a daughter of Athena and his satyr friend, Percy must embark on a quest to the underworld to find the bolt and return it to Olympus before the peace of the gods is broken, battling monsters and gods along the way.<br /><br />The book doesn't fulfill its full potential, perhaps, but it is very good---fun, cute, and even a little educational!  My only criticism would be that there is a bit of environmentalist propaganda through the satyr character, but it's not that bad and is such a minor part of the story that it hardly matters.  I'd definitely recommend this for kids, or for adults who like kids' books!
B00913P6G0|5.0|Hip-hop has become so generic lately, but good kid, m.A.A.d city steps out of the box big time. Kendrick Lamar basically carries the weight of the West-side on his shoulders; he's had high expectations to bring it back on the hip hop map. Lamar comes from a harsh background, living in Compton and that's what this whole album is based on. He tells his story to perfection, back from when he was younger and the lyrics are incredible. This is one of the best hip hop albums in the last few years.<br /><br />His story starts off with the first track, \\"Sherane a.k.a. Master Splinter's Daughter.\\" Sherane is young Kendrick's love interest at the time and this song is the basic overview of her (she's one of the main focal points in the story). The lyrics are superb and the ending where he mentions \\"two guys in black hoodies\\" sets up what's to come. Just like most of the other songs, it has a recording of voice mails from his mom.<br /><br />As \\"good kid, m.A.A.d city\\" continues, tracks like \\"B*tch, don't kill my vibe\\", \\"The Art of Peer Pressure\\", \\"mAAd city\\" and so on give you the visual of his trials and tribulations. Kendrick explains how he has a heart of gold and want's to be successful, but the lifestyle he lives holds him back. Along with those cuts from the album, \\"Backseat Freestyle\\" shows a different side of Kendrick. At first, the song sounds out of his element, but he play's his previous 'cocky' role well and there's some nice world play with it too.<br /><br />Two standout tracks on this album follow up each other, in \\"Money Trees\\" and \\"Poetic Justice\\". Both songs are a little out of K-Dot's comfort zone, but they're both done well; not to mention they have two great features. \\"Money Trees\\" features his Black Hippy counterpart, Jay Rock. This song basically recaps everything that has happened thus far, including the two guys that jumped him. The lyricism on Kendrick's part is unique, but Jay Rock's lyrics just stand out to me more. His verse shows that he also lived in a tough environment and he describes it well. \\"Broken promises, steal yo watch and tell you what time it is/ Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a footlocker is.\\" Drake is then featured on the laid back \\"Poetic Justice\\" track. This is most likely based on his thoughts about Sherane, while Drake is very good on this beat. Both recordings at the end of songs have a mix of comedy, then more seriousness. \\"good kid\\" and \\"m.A.A.d City\\" are two very captivating tracks on this album as well; mainly because of Kendrick's ability to perform his vocal switch-ups in the m.A.A.d City record.<br /><br />Every track has it's purpose on this album, but it all comes together in the 12 minute 'combined' track, \\"Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst.\\" This was one of the most hyped songs on Kendrick's album and it definitely lived up to the hype. In \\"Sing About Me\\", Kendrick raps from the perspective of Dave's brother, who is seeking vengeance for his brothers death; along with a girl that's been damaged by the system and has become a prostitute. Both are unique and differ in their own aspects, because they are both interesting stories. \\"Dying of Thirst\\" is basically the final act, when his friends are tired of running and plan to get back at the other gang. Kendrick explains how they are tired of running, along with him also being a sinner; but wanting a change. The voice of the preaching woman is very powerful, and it's the point where Kendrick and his friends are living for the lord. \\"You dying of thirst, so hop in that (holy) water, and pray it works.\\"<br /><br />The tracks \\"Real\\" and \\"Compton\\" end the album on a high note, while the deluxe edition includes \\"Recipe\\", featuring Dr. Dre, \\"Black Boy Fly\\", and \\"Swimming Pools.\\" The music and lyrics are unique and the story is compelling throughout. \\"good kid, m.A.A.d city\\" is one of the most outstanding hip-hop albums I've ever heard.<br /><br />Recommended Tracks:<br />5.) Money Trees (feat. Jay Rock)<br />8.) m.A.A.d City(feat. MC Eiht)<br />10.) Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst(feat. MC Eiht)<br />10.) Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Homeland is a very intense show with excellent plot and acting.  It is worth watching each episode more than once because it is easy to miss details.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is a great \\"chapter\\" in the story of Percy Jackson and his friends!  Rick Riordan picks up right where we left off at the end of 'Son of Neptune'.  The action kicks in right away and doesn't stop.  But the characters and their relationships with each other drive the story.  Every book in the series (as well as the first Percy Jackson and the Olympians series) gives you more and exciting greek and roman myths to explore.  I found myself looking up many of the gods and monsters just so I could have a better picture of the character while I was reading about them.  The end DOES NOT disappoint!  I can't wait for the next \\"chapter\\"....it can't come soon enough.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Winter was a most satisfactory second volume of the 20th Century trilogy. The characters were well defined and grew due circumstances in their lives. I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  My only question is how long do I have to wait for volume 3?
B000ELJBAK|5.0|I have been a Pink Floyd for a long time. I give David a try, was I right. You won't be wrong.

B005K01VZS|5.0|This book makes you feel good. Right along with all Alblooms good vibes. Very touching and worth the 2 days it takes to read! You can't put it down!
B003QSMCKO|5.0|Mulan is a girl who doesn't believe in her self. She stands out from everyone in her culture, but she learns that no matter who she is she can become a hero to a nation because of her courage. She teaches us not to give up. Her father has been called to serve an army. Her father is not doing very well, but he feels like he must honor his country. Find out what happens that causes Mulan to be brave and end up being a a hero to her nation. Funny, loving, and a sweet movie. Great for the kids to watch. Very family friendly.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I absolutly loved the first book n couldnt wait to read the second one. Boy was i disappointed. I read the book in 2 days hoping tht something other than them fighting would happen!! Hopefully the third book will make up for this.. But if u liked the first book still get this one because it still holds vital information!!
B0014DQSGW|4.0|So funny. It is worth it. It is about a man who hires a woman who he believes is perfect for the job. What happens is after a year, the woman realizes that her whole life is put on hold just for the man. She ends up giving her two notice. The man learns the old rule that you never know what you have until you lost it. He does everything he can to get ready, but a twist happens to changes both of their lifes. Watch it. I always peed my pants of laughing. It has a great ending.
B008K5T5AI|4.0|Another splendid Culture novel, with the breathtaking scope of the Galactic setting as a backdrop to the travails of a central \\"human\\" protagonist and the foibles of a committee of Ship minds.  Thoroughly recommended
B0094BB4TW|2.0|the app only loads about 10 status updates after that nada, comments dont always post correctly and i thought maybe id get notifications for the app while im connected to wifi which i dont not sure if thats an actual flaw or because im on the kindle.<br /><br />i will be switching back to going through my dolphin browser
B003EYVXTG|5.0|Great movie Jennifer Lawrence is a really good actress.The storyline is really good it's kind of a mafia setting .
B0064O927I|4.0|Hard to set up but once you get it set up its a really nice watch. I've had people come up to me asking about the watch. No one else I work with has this watch and it's a real head turner.
1933865407|5.0|I'm a huge Bruce Timm. This is a great collection of female figure drawings. Though his medium and genre change from chapter to chapter, they all retain that classic Bruce Timm style I love so much.<br /><br />Oh yes, I should mention, the book is broken up into different \\"chapters\\" So you have some fantasy, superhero(ine), noir, etc, all organized in to different collections.<br /><br />The book itself is attractive. Printed on thick, heavy glossy paper. It just... it feels nice in your hands, if that makes any difference to you.
B008TMA1LY|2.0|touch screen is way to slow- cannot get to ! - they do not disappear. Is it my devise or what?
006107327X|4.0|I grew up with Batman: The Animated Series. It introduced me to the world of Bruce Timm, one of my now favorites. This is a fantastic look at the series as a whole. Some great storyboards and character development sheets that you rarely get to see.<br /><br />I won't give it 5 stars, simply because the binding seems a little flimsy. Mine is still in good condition, but I worry that after a couple of reads, it may start to come apart. A hardcover copy would be nicer. But, that is my only complaint.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I liked this book from the beginning to the end... which shocked me greatly.<br /><br />I would recommended it to those interested in a light mystery reading.
030758836X|3.0|Gone Girl was a difficult read for me for the first section of the book.  The rest of the book held my interest and kept me wondering, now what can happen?  Who will win?  I really did not like the ending, but understand why the book ended as it did.  It will be an interesting discussion at the book club meeting.
0316228532|3.0|Forget Harry Potter. J.K. Rowling has already proven herself to be an excellent writer. She is descriptive and thoughtful when parsing her words, but I just didn't love this book. For me, The Casual Vacancy is a lackluster book that is for adults and plays to a very different audience. It deals with a ton of adult issues that are cringe worthy as it traverses life in a small english town and the often perverse characters who live there. It has profanity which is a good sign that this is for oldsters or the over 18 crowd.. This book suffers from a melodramatic and soapy plots that have a predictable endings. The characters are often unlikeable and even despicable. Suffice to say that I didn't really care much for the characters who were as nasty as the subject matter.<br />I didn't plan on getting depressed while reading this book but after a couple of hundred pages I realized I wasn't liking the slippery path this book was taking me on. In the end, this book followed an all-too-familiar formula perfected in Peyton Place or TV series like Dallas with lots of conflict, character flaws, and dirty little secrets meant to shock and titilate.<br />This book works against the author to a great extent because of the high and unreasonable expectations placed on Rowling's work. It's a completely different genre that is often unforgiving and plays by a completely different set of rules which aren't all that flexible.
B008MEM24S|5.0|this game is awesome because there is lazers and it also has waterguns its very cool YOU GET THIS GAME NOW!!!!
B008BRC7BE|5.0|I love this album!! It has a little of everthing and a lot of Gillan!! I love the Tony Martin  and Glen Hughes stuff as well!! The two new songs will blow you away!! My Only complaint is the booklet. Could they have messed it up anymore? Trying to read it takes some time cause you start on page 3 then go to the back, then to the middle then back to page 1 then back to the back and finally end in the middle again! I know it's just an editing problem but come on guys. Try reading the booklet before you send it out to the public. I highly recomend this album, but you've been warned about the liner notes!!
B001N4RORE|5.0|My new exercise routine! At least once a week to make my smile muscles work and my face not droop. Such rules to write a review, sometimes short and concise is the best.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|cool! something's different fun play in the space.. curve shoots. keep around the orbit till hit. awesome to play as other angry birds games.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Having grown up in the 50's, I lived with segregation.  I didn't live in the South, but knew people who did.  I have to say, this movie was well written, trying to incorporate a way of life known and practiced by Southerners, shown through the eyes of the help.  My Mother cleaned other people's houses to help earn money for her family.  Though she was white, working for whites, she had very similar experiences.  But, I can't imagine what it was like for a black woman to work for a Southern white family.  I felt that this movie was very convincing in relating the trials and treatment of the Black domestic help.  I give it an A+
B009GEAPYW|4.0|Thought they should have used Kevin Conroys voice for the Batman...no disrepect to Robocop. The storyline was great but the animation leads alot to be desired..dont like the block like figure drawing...but this is more the frank miller style...gritty dark graphic novel-like appeal...so guess were stuck with it. Overall...enjoyed it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|starts off making you think it's too easy, then your stuck! it's really entertaining. have fun getting through the mazes!
B0090EIC3Y|2.0|Meets all the criteria necessary to be a hit with today's 20-somethings.  Requires absolutely no thought or concentration to enjoy.  The mindless masses should lovd it!  Not my cup of tea.  Waste of my time and money.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Took me about 5 hours To read cuz I was so excited! Kinda goes the same as the first book as in the dialog and the sex but I still loved it
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I haven't tried some of the other alarm apps out there because I don't need to. This app has everything you could want. It even lets you use your own music to wake your self up! I love it.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|We're relatively new fans of Mumford & Sons, and I almost never buy an album (downloaded or CD format) when it's brand new, but I made an exception in this case.  A long road trip needs some new tunes, and this was just the ticket.  :)<br /><br />We're of Celtic heritage (both my husband and me), and listen to full-on Celtic music regularly.  Our son would say \\"almost constantly, Mom.\\"  ;)  Regardless, we have found ourselves LOVING the mandolin, banjo, and other instruments in these songs.  The Celtic heritage notwithstanding, the melodies are catchy and singable, the lyrics are deep, and many songs are \\"ear-worm-able,\\" which means I wake up with one running through my noggin on any given morning (today, it's \\"Hopeless Wanderer\\").<br /><br />I especially appreciate the raw honesty in the lyrics of M&S - they convey what I experience, believe, and don't have the musical eloquence to convey on my own.  We did remove \\"Broken Crown\\" from the playlist b/c of its explicit nature, and b/c I don't want to have that particular conversation with our 10 y/o son.  He knows the meaning of the word and that it's vulgar, but for his (still concrete-thinking) brain to wrap itself around the use of that word in lyrics by a group professing faith is more than he can handle and more explanation than I want to engage in at the moment.  It will go back in the playlist as he grows, but for now, it's out.<br /><br />M&S is on high-rotation in our home right now - for good reason.  If you like real, gritty, and indie-sounding music, you'll love \\"Babel\\" as much as we do.  :)
B004R6JG7Q|5.0|I can be more specific about this movie,because it was the first racing film that I saw when I was a child.the acting is great from all cast,specially steve Mc Queen since its something he loved(racing)the special effects are good for the time it was done.I recomend highly to those that grew up with any type of involment with cars.the RPM'S are great,no matter what age your looking!!!
B00866H7SS|5.0|OMG what can I say about Bared to You . . Loved the book ..read in a day !!  could not wait for the next book to be out !!
B0015DROBO|5.0|This is a great read.  I liked it better than the movie in was more in depth.  I would recommend this book to my friends.

B0087YYHZU|5.0|This is entertainment at its best. These 3 are comedians with excellent timing AND incredible dancers. Kelly is the \\"Everyman's\\" Astaire. His interpretation is earthy and spot on. The side kick is awesome. His highlight is \\"Make em Laugh\\"
B008GVD6D8|5.0|loved the book - a great read - Sylvia day yet again wrote a great novel which had me going to bed yet again after 3am - could not put the book down
B001B51B9M|5.0|It is awesome to Find music Man on DVD for under 20 bucks.  The quality is great.  The service exceptional.  Wonderful songs, dancing and funny moments.

B007FEFLTO|4.0|This 2 book in the series seems to be somewhat of a bridge between the second and the third.  At least I am hoping that the 3rd installment is more like the first book.  That being said,  I did enjoy this book and would recommend it to others.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really liked the mystery and suspense in this book.  Not thrilled with the ending but I would read it again and definatly recommend it.
B004X75RK4|3.0|The story line was great! The acting was really good, and the movie was funny! We enjoyed watching it. But for a PG-13 rating, we were a little surprised at the nudity. It also seemed like it had a lot of language. It should have been rated R. We could never let our children watch it, or recommend it to friends unless we had ClearPlay.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This calculator doesn't give the standard results most calculators give to this equation 100 X 25 % + = 125. Also it doesn't do markdown when you enter 125 - 25 % it doesn't. give you 100 as the answer.
B003VANOFY|4.0|This is a great headset but the mic could be much better. With that being said let's break this review down into PROs and CONs.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-AMAZING sound quality! The 7.1 surround sound makes you feel like you're in the game!<br />-SUPER comfortable! I have left these bad boys on for hours and my head and ears feel fine!<br />-EASY to setup and start using! Some advice for this though, install the drivers (on the CD) before you start charging them for the 1st time<br />-GREAT build quality! They are made out of plastic but I feel that they will hold up to whatever I throw at them...or throw them at. :)<br />-LONG battery life! I get at least 9 hours out of these headphones, which is usually at least two days.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-MIC quality. The mic quality sucks. But this headset isn't made for the mic, it's a gaming HEADSET. If you want a good mic, go get a Blue Yeti or Snowball.<br />-CHARGING time is long, but just plug them in over night OR just plug them in and keep using them! (easy fix)<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />A great gaming headset that you can use all day and not have to worry about your head or ears hurting. That being said, if you're looking to get a good mic out this, you won't. The mic is the only reason I'm giving this headset 4 stars out of 5. If you want a good, low price mic, get a Blue Snowball. They're around $65. [[ASIN:B002OO333Q Blue Microphones Snowball USB Microphone (Brushed Aluminum)]]
B00124HT8O|5.0|This does not have all the hits but what it does have is a great introduction to Arthur Lee and Love. Some great music in this package that I missed when the album came out.  Highly advised!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved this book. I was going to pass it by because I did NOT like \\"Under the Dome\\", but after reading reviews, decided to give it a try. I was riveted. I mean, we all know that King is a master with words. This same story with any less of a author would have driven me crazy. The book is 840 pages long, and we don't even get to the main objective until the last 1/3 of the book. But you know what? It was so worth it. The gear up was just as good as the main events. And the closer I got to the \\"main\\" action, the more I talked out loud to the book, to the characters, and to Mr. King. I'm just hoping I didn't give anything away for my husband!<br /><br />I'm not a history bluff, but everything seemed to fit the era. Jake/George was such a powerful character. And the love story? It triumphs all.<br /><br />Read this one if you haven't!
B005L38QHA|2.0|Mostly just confirming existing reviews here but:<br /><br />Pros: Ergonomic, easy to-read buttons; easy to program, decently precise (when it tracks properly).<br />Cons: Often loses tracking, small profile.<br />Verdict: More user-friendly than the average MMO mouse, and the size won't bother those without giant meat-hands, but the tendency to lose track of the mousing surface makes it a frustrating liability in fast-paced situations, and the price point is excessive for a wired mouse. Not terrible, but not something I would recommend either.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This collection is just amazing and leaves me wanting for sections 6-10.  Even if they are never written, I am content to imagine how they might play out.<br /><br />With a perfect blend of foreshadowing, red herrings, and other devices, I was always on my toes and found myself constantly discussing this book with my wife.  There are insightful portrayals of what a future could look like and realistic characters I could identify with.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book did a fantastic job continuing the story line of Eva and Gideon where<br />The first book ended. I couldn't put it down, and can't wait for December 31 to get here to read the next book :)
B007THA4FI|2.0|Sorry, I tried to enjoy this book.  I started out with interest in how she would do in a different style of book, but I quickly started making comparisons to other authors, and this book came up lacking.  The further I got into the book the less interested I became in the characters, and the less interested I was in reading this book.  When I realized I was intentionally avoiding picking this up to continue reading it, I gave up.
B005FISBTO|5.0|I am addicted to the Dexter series. This season was just as great as the rest. Cannot wait till 7 comes out so I can order that too!
B0097UO87U|4.0|This is a beautiful, carefully-constructed love letter to pre-Beatles 50s nostalgia, and it works perfectly.<br /><br />I especially love Jeff's arrangement of \\"So Sad,\\" which bookends nicely with Gene Clark's soulful, aching version, as well as the opener \\"She\\" which immediately sets the tone.<br /><br />Close your eyes and fall back into Jeff Lynne's landscape -- you won't regret it.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Best book ever!  I've read it 4 or 5 times now and will read it again. cant wait for the next one!
1606995359|5.0|As a child and even now well into my late 40s, I have enjoyed the Walt Disney comics, especially the exploits of Uncle Srooge and the rest of the duck family.  Yes, I understand Donald came first, but frankly, Uncle Scrooge is my favorite.  This collection and the other volume (and soon to be more!) are almost like candy to me, and I would recommend it to anyone who has or had enjoyed Barks' works.  I even recommend them as an introduction or reinforcement for the younger generations who missed out on the earlier periods of comics.  In this age of superheroes, partial to full nudity, and extreme violence, these comics show what really can and should be done - entertain, not shock!<br /><br />My only complaint is that I wish they were being put out faster.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|I recently discovered the TV show Castle and hence I started reading the Nikki Heat series.  They are very enjoyable and a great read.  The characters are like the TV and therefore like old friends.  But the books are full of characters that are fun and the stories read so fast that before I know it I am at the end of the book and sorry that I didn't read slower.  You will not be disappointed to buy the Heat series books. Enjoy
B009B2U73I|3.0|I have enjoyed and own, all of Diana Krall's albums and have always felt her unique voice belongs to Jazz and Standards.  I was very disappointed with this recent release and it's 99% due to song selections.  Her velvety tones did not come across as I was so accoustomed to hearing with her previous releases.  I don't know who decided on this particular list of songs, but, for future albums, please return to the Jazz and Standards.
B007ZTLLMK|4.0|This game is not a free flight game it has multiple challanges that you can try. I found it very entertaining until I had completed all the levels.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I ordered a new case and was sold an old one.  It came complete with fingerprints and smudges and the silent switch didn't work.  Got the run around from both Lifeproof and Amazon and still don't have a case for my phone.  Very disappointed.
B008XNZMOU|4.0|It seems that heartbreak does good to Taylor Swift. At least to her music. John Mayer as an inspiration for one of best songs on her previous \\"Speak Now\\" album (the sprawling and stinging \\"Dear John\\") now aside, on her fourth album \\"Red\\" she shines brighter than ever. Indeed, lyrically, she's really as 22 (born in December 1989), as she sings on the eponymous song, one of the highlights of the record. Relationships stuff still serves as a prime source of inspiration for this superstar, which, in turn, makes her a next-door-girl and easily identifiable with for many of her peers.<br /><br />Her style is now far from country alone, indeed, only a fiddle in the closer \\"Begin Again\\" may remind you of that. In fact, Swift makes her pop more global and open to new inspirations. The record begins with \\"State of Grace\\", a starter similar to U2's \\"Where The Streets Have No Name\\" on the classic \\"The Joshua Tree\\" LP. And two guest stars from Britain give their best as well - Gary Lightbody sounds real (and maybe better than ever) on \\"The Last Time\\", while the Brit Awards sensation Ed Sheeran joins in but stays decently out of the spotlight on the tenderly melodic \\"Everything Has Changed\\". The British stamp is unmistakably heard on \\"All Too Well\\", while \\"Starlight\\" sports Keane-like piano.<br /><br />Elsewhere, Taylor is as ingenious as ever. \\"I Knew You Were Trouble\\", \\"22\\" (where her vocals are similar to Alanis Morissette) and the No.1 smash \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\" find her at the top of her game and with uncanny synergy with Swedish master pop composer Max Martin (guy behind hits of Backstreet Boys and Kelly Clarkson, among many others). Energetic \\"Holy Ground\\" sounds well juxtaposed to ballad \\"Sad Beautiful Tragic\\".  And almost every song has an added value to it (the sum of the record's parts is higher than at \\"Fearless\\" and \\"Speak Now\\", which both got a tad samey towards the end), including \\"Treacherous\\", co-written by Adele's collaborator Dan Wilson.<br/><br />Generous at its 16 songs, \\"Red\\" should not disappoint Taylor Swift's loyal fans, as it expands the musical horizon gradually, gently - and sublimely. This barrier-breaking album is maybe the next best thing to save the current lame pop music based on short-lived dance tracks. Already one of the highest-grossing artists of our day, Taylor Swift is the one who definitely deserves it, since there is not much pop artists left of her stature now, which - given her still the tender age and the full-blown artistic maturity in one - is all the more impressive.<br /><br />This rewarding \\"Red\\" should definitely get the green. Like... ever.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|When a movie has an outstanding legacy that's a big jump. This movie could have been great but it decided to be poignant instead. Is it worth seeing once? You might even love it. But I'm not interested in seeing again let alone buying it. It's not Marley and Me or anything but if I can't enjoy it with my grandkids than I can't enjoy it at all. Grandmas be warned.<br /><br />Now that the movie is out on DVD I've watched it a few times. The rest of the movie is creative enough to where I just tune out the end. Griffin is a great character. I wish we would see more of him.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This biography has justifiably received so many positive reviews that I'm not sure what's left to say. So I'll leave it at this.... I don't know if the real Steve Jobs was a compelling, fascinatingly flawed, colorfully borderline genius with a gift for understanding what products customers wanted, for pruning the features they did not, and for bringing those products to life through a complex mix of vision, self-certainty, and intimidation. But that's the Steve Jobs I met in this book. As Isaacson did in his recent biography of Einstein, he has beautifully attuned this one's tone and language to his subject, creating not just a story of Jobs but an experience of the man. I was tired for a week from reaching for the book (actually, my Kindle) at bedtime and not putting it down until long after.
B003HV0TN2|5.0|I'm amazed that this is Patrick Rothfuss' first published book. He writes like a poet and a good one at that, as he spins a tale that just keeps you engrossed for hours on end.<br />The story also avoids the usual fantasy formulas. There's magic, but the magic has limits based on an internal consistency and rules like Physics and Chemistry which are taught along-side it in the university. The main character Kvothe is neither purely good nor evil. He's mostly just getting by on his wits while his ego helps create a lot of his own problems.<br />Also read the sequel \\"The Wise Mans Fear\\".<br />Desperately hanging out for the 3rd novel.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Its a Johnny Depp movie to say the least but my family and I loved this Corky comedy. I would rent it again.
030758836X|2.0|I was really enjoying this book almost all the way through--an interesting, suspenseful, twisted psychological story. It was all ruined by a complete cop-out of an ending. Left me feeling like I wasted the time I put into reading it. This wasn't an issue of me disagreeing with the ending, or being upset because it wasn't wrapped up the way I wanted, it was that the last chapter was lazy and not thoughtful at all. The writer had no ending...which made no sense because the book was written like she had something in mind....
B004J4WLB4|5.0|It's an amazing portrayal of people trapped by their early experiences as they work to relate in the present.  By working backwards and forwards, the author eases us into the craziness, foreshadowing throughout, always leaving us hoping for the fairytale outcome.  The language of flowers is the glue that weaves the story together across generations.  A great read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is more than i expected. the love story behind it, the way Anastacia is and Christian‘s soft moments are endearing. I completely fell in love with Mr 50 shades.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|If you follow me on Twitter, you may have noticed that I have recently been extolling the virtues of libraries. They're in every major neighbourhood of your city, they have books, movies, CDs, ebooks and even audiobooks, and, most important, they're FREE.<br /><br />Okay, you may need to wait a little to get a really hot title (I'm 85th on the waitlist for Caitlin Moran's How to Be a Woman), but that's the beauty of books: they're there pretty much forever.<br /><br />I'd been waiting for a few weeks to get Stephen Greenblatt's The Swerve: How the World Became Modern, but I'm quite happy I did. I finished it in three days, and I'm writing this review before I bring it back to the library for another lucky fellow/fellowette to have the pleasure of reading it.<br /><br />Stephen Greenblatt is a famous Shakespeare scholar and the general editor of your Norton Anthology of English Literature which you haven't opened since your first-year English course. He is well-read, infinitely knowledgeable about his topic, and quite entertaining.<br /><br />The Swerve isn't your typical academic criticism. It's more the historical journey of a single text, Lucretius' On the Nature of Things, from its origins in Epicurean philosophy, through its loss and rediscovery by an obscure Florentine scribe named Poggio Bracciolini, to its influence on Enlightenment thinking and all the way through to modern philosophy.<br /><br />  In the winter of 1417, Poggio Bracciolini rode through the wooded hills and valleys of southern Germany toward his distant destination, a monastery reputed to have a cache of old manuscripts. As must have been immediately apparent to the villagers looking out at him from the doors of their huts, the man was a stranger.<br /><br />As someone who has, in a distant past, studied the humanities, including On the Nature of Things, this book was a fascinating look into an unknown part (to me at least) of bibliographic history: how classical manuscripts were produced, copied and recovered after the Middle Ages. When we read Plato or Homer or Virgil, do we ever ask how the text has survived through the millennia?The Swerve digs deep into that history, without ever being dry or academic, and tells you the story of a text. It's fascinating.<br /><br />It's a difficult task to weave together the history of a text with the history of his discoverer, but Greenblatt did a great job linking them together. Although focused on a single text, The Swerve really surveys the evolution of an entire mode of thinking from ancient Greece to the 20th century. If you thought that old Greek and Roman texts are basically curiosities only interesting to thick-glassed scholars toiling away in a dusty library basements, think again. On the Nature of Things has influenced philosophers, scientists and thinkers as varied as Copernicus and Galileo, Thomas More, Darwin the grandfather and even American founding fathers Jefferson and Adams.<br /><br />  More than fifty manuscripts of De rerum natura from the fifteenth century survive today-a startlingly large number, though there must have been many more. Once Gutenberg's clever technology was commercially established, printed editions quickly followed. The editions were routinely prefaced with warnings and disavowals.<br /><br />If you have an interest in literary history, bibliography, archival research, Greek and Roman antiquities, the Renaissance and 15th century papal history, I strongly suggest this book. It's a quick read (250 pages or so of actual text) and it kept me more interested than many novels I have read lately.<br /><br />Do you wonder how the world became modern? This book doesn't explain it all, but it does give you an insight into one text that contained the seeds of modernity.pied and recovered after the Middle Ages.

B006G7R2KW|5.0|well  1st off  you have  to  NOT  mind  violence  and  nudity.  I have no problem  there.  I  wasn't  disappointed  at  with  the  direction  of  the  story.. lots  of  surprises  and  twists  and  interesting  new  characters  bad  and  good  guys. for  me.. this  series  is  up  there  with  the  Sopranos.  :-)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The reason I say surprising is because I have been disappointed lately by some of the \\"end of the world\\" novels that have been spun out haphazardly.  This one is really very well written.  The concept is very interesting and though it is a bit predictable, you really don't care.  Very nice character development and just plain fun to read.  I am very satisfied!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I have loved Taylor Swifts music since taking my granddaughter to see her Speak Now concert in Birmingham (yes I must be the oldest Taylor Swift fan at 60) It was quite simply one of the best concert I have ever been to , her music combines every emotion and always leaves you on a high, I feel sorry for people who have not taken the time to explore her music as they are missing so much.<br />I run a company  designing loudspeaker systems and I am always on the look out for new music to test them to the limit, and that is what Taylor does , her music is intoxicating and can be complex, she is surrounded by superb musicians and the production and sound quality of all her albums is excellent (why can't other artists do this?)<br />Speak Now was one of my favourite albums of the last 20 years and I feared  that Red would not be as good, After  listening to the album 3 times I am starting to like it a lot ,Taylor is able to educate you to like music you would  never have thought of listening to , she is a superb artist who has given so much pleasure to people of all ages . In the uk she is regarded as just a teen musician , this is rediculous- she is far more than that, and deserves praise from all music sectors.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved this book.  Rick is one of my favorite authors and didn't disappoint me in this one. I cant wait for the next book to come out!!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|This was a fun and challenging game I am looking forward to Enigmatis II to be released. I will definitely buy.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great book. A very very great read, was very pleased. You will not be upset when you buy. Was worth the money.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Entertaining, humorous, different than my usual genre of interest,but worth every minute.  Could not put it down. Definitely a good read.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|game had excellent graphics and was very suspenseful game played smoothly no hiccups in gameplay and easily downloaded I would highly recommend this game to everybody!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001PPGAIA|1.0|I received the DVD and by the time I was able to sit down to watch it, the warranty had run out.  The DVD does not work.  It continues to load and then an error icon lights up.  My other DVD's play so I know it is not my DVD player.
B003MC5N28|4.0|It is interesting to see how this book deals with the diffrences in life between various people and how trying to destroy those differences we work so hard to cover up in our socieities actually destroy the foundation of a life well lived.
B006VGGAC4|3.0|The book is very drawn out and dry at times. Focuses a lot more on his early bodybuilding career than I anticipated.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett didn't disappoint with the 2nd book of the Century Trilogy.  With some of the main characters living the full horrors of war,  the book seems to convey the realities of war in a more personal way. Love his books and can't wait for the third installment.
B009EAO38C|5.0|Love the music, I found them by watching their videos on their YT channel. Search them and watch their videos, if you like them buy this album. It is great to listen to and is worth the money for the enjoyment. They really are a great group and I am very impressed with the spins on modern and classical songs, some of them I believe are better then the originals. If you like them show them your support and buy this album!
B008NABUU8|5.0|I've played quite a few games like this and this one is the best so far with the best graphics and most complexity I've come across. defiantly worth it if you want to have some fun and use your brain at the same time.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I couldn't put it down, cant wait for the final installment in the trilogy. Follett has a mastery with the pen and a really powerful way of inserting history into his novels
1416562605|5.0|Superficially this story appears to be a joke about an Indian from the Hindu lower caste who wants to advise the Chinese leader about the success of being an entrepreneur in India.  Actually, it's an indictment of the 21st century weakness of the government, its corruptions and its social torpor.<br /><br />The author writes of the comedy, tragedy, and dreams of a man who wants to escape his karma.
B008TMA1LY|1.0|I am a huge fan so I was so excited to see this game. I read the reviews and should have known better! Money pit!!! You can't even play past level 1 without paying. What a rip off and a joke! Shame on u Sanrio! uninstalled!!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|WOW, WHAT A TWIST AND TURN BOOK! JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU HAVE IT FIGURED OUT THERE IS ANOTHER TWIST IN THE TALE!THE AUTHOR WOVE QUITE A STORY HERE...TALK ABOUT A VENGEFUL WIFE!  THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST READS I HAVE HAD ALL YEAR, REALLY ENJOYED IT.  THIS WOULD MAKE A GREAT MOVIE!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I really enjoy it! just wish I could get more energy quicker! : ) I definetly reccommend this game!<br />It would be neat to be able to switch characters too.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|The adds are quite annoying but almost all free apps are now doing this.. so we should probably get used to it! Other than that- I love this.. This one is my go-to for any changes ...whether its to add color, or write on a picture, or add pictures to my picture-- I chose this app for all edits.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Very good movie my husband And i watched it And loved it. We never thought it was going to be that good.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|notice you get threw some levles it wont let you go pass it. Allison when you go yo click something. it will go to something elce
030746363X|2.0|The title is a lot of hype.<br /><br />The fact is this information is freely available if you research it, but it's great if you don't want to do all the research yourself. It's a great guide for facts and scientifically based advice.<br /><br />He is a detail man and his journey sounds like it was fun for \\"him\\". I think that the money and years he spent to get all of his data was a waste, but I understand that he likes to experiment. Facts and figures don't inspire, as struggle and victory do.<br /><br />He has you convinced of his passion for knowledge but I did not feel his passion to help people change.<br /><br />This is an intellectuals guide and it doesn't really connect on an emotional level. He rather uses facts to convince and his desire to pride himself on being extreme. He is a perfectionist which unfortunately does not display realism or relatability.<br /><br />He refers to Body-for-Life a few times because of it's great success and that book definitely connects on an emotional\inspirational level. I would have liked to have read more stories about his personal struggle to attain his goals and his desire to help others.<br /><br />I would like to see a follow up book on how his data has helped many other people. Let's see the years of data on the application of his research on others and his ability to lead others to change.<br /><br />I am convinced that Tim Ferris can do what he claims, but there is no convincing that others can. Bill Phillips was and still is an agent of change. Bill Phillips is a leader in the field of body transformation and still continues to be in his new plan for getting results for others.<br /><br />It would be nice to see all of the before and afters of the 4HB program. Actually, it's not really a plan just a reference book.<br /><br />I did walk away reminded of the data I've already learned and applied, which is good. I feel reminders are important. I did like how Tim is all about making the most of your time. People really do spend too much time on things that can be done efficiently. Overall, I enjoyed the book. I would have given it a worse rating if it wasn't fun. I'm sure Tim is fun.<br /><br />I would recommend to pick it up for a guide on how to. It is scientifically sound. It's good as a reference like a dictionary, but realize that's all it's really for.
B008HK3QII|5.0|This is an exceptionally well made case.  The look and feel is great.  The sewing is impeccable.  The size is perfect, the padding is just right.  To me it feels like you could drop this thing 6 feet onto concrete with Kindle Fire HD 7\\" inside and not suffer damage no matter how it landed.  I haven't actually tried this, but that's my rough estimate of it's protectiveness.  Mostly what I use it for is in the gym bag and the back pack.  I would normally say that the price is a bit of gouging, but I've bought cases like this before for cameras, sunglasses, Sony PSP, Nintendo DS, etc, and this case is definitely one of the nicer ones I've seen.<br /><br />It also fits the Google Nexus 7, though I don't recommend buying it for that because the dimensions are not exact.
B00006I53S|4.0|Other than the lens creep I'd rate this lens a 4.5/5. Yes this isn't \\"L\\" lens quality but it's damn close. My major disappointment with this lens is where it begins at 28mm. I wouldn't consider it a perfect \\"walk-around\\" for that reason but that may be a personal preference. It's also the same reason why I didn't take this lens on a recent trip of mine. I'd prefer most of my lens's to start at a 24mm (at least). That is usually why I use a 24mm prime for candids and most uses. If this was an 18 or 24-135mm then I'd for sure give it a 5 star review. Otherwise, I think it's a great all around lens with minimal limitations. Overall I highly recommend this lens. Great IQ with great versatility. Prices are good here on Amazon so why not. Enjoy!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|!Loved the first book in the trilogy. Winter of the World continues the family sagas through the middle of the 20th century seamlessly. I can't wait for the final volume covering the decades I of my life<br /><br />.
B008NABUU8|5.0|Works well no glitches with my asus tablet but inferior ones might lack procesing capabilities. Fun game if you like buildng.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Not only is the book grim and depressing - it's only point seems to be that there is ugliness in life and, oh yeah, that Rowling knows how to curse and be coarse.  Save your money
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|Loved this album. Has a bluegrass feel on some of the songs. Really enjoy it. 50 ways to say goodbye and bruises are worth listening to over and over.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I am throughly enjoying reading Sylvia Day's Crossfire Novels.  This is the 2nd installment of the trilogy and it keeps me on the edge of my seat.  It is SIMILAR to 50 Shades of Grey trilogy but a little more graphic and not as much of a love store as 50 Shades.  It is still VERY GOOD reading and has kept me  wanting more.  I hate that I now have to wait until May for the final chapter.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for similar reading to 50 Shades.  I wish Sylvia would write more novels along this line instead of her period pieces.
B0073XORCY|5.0|Better than expected, I'd say.  The old boy still has it!  Fresh new songs, combined with a new hand picked group of talented musicians.  Brought me back in time, it did.  Yes Ian, you are still my number one!
B000V63BN6|5.0|I listened to each song to decide if I wanted to just buy a few of them singly.  EVERY song was a good one so I wound up just purchasing the whole album.  Stevie Wonder is one of the greats!
0307386171|5.0|Ian McEwan is my favorite author writing in English. Atonement, Amsterdam, The Black Dog, and many others<br />are must reads in my opinion.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Loved this! Rick Riordan manages to blend both Greek and Roman mythology into one heck of a story! I can't wait for the House of Hades in the Fall!
B008NABUU8|3.0|Had to pull the battery out three times now. The game seems fun but loads really slow and then freezes on me when I'm trying to build a bridge.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it was ok but not the best I think it was time wasting and boring I have played things more fun
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I really enjoyed the fast pace and surprising twists of this book. I stayed up late to finish this one!  The main character is believable; Jack Reacher is a \\"real person\\" hero and not a fantasy super hero. Fight scenarios are specific yet not horrific. Romantic encounters are fun and not too graphic. I ordered the second Jack Reacher book already.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm glad its out now and it has many of the good minerals like diamonds gold iron and obsidian .<br />but very different from Xbox and Pc.<br />it needs redstone pistons buckets armor and buttons<br />it also needs. more mobs such as iron golems and  snow men cats villagers squids blazes endermen ghasts wolves silverfish slime.<br />but still pretty good for kindle fire
B009HSVHV2|5.0|Been a kiss fan since \\"73\\"..  I like this album !!!! it's fresh and really shouldn't be compared to past albums...
B009MCRHH6|4.0|I love the game. I played it for hours on my dads ipad. when I first got my kindle last Christmas I immediately looked for this game. I looked for it once a month and now they finally have it. but $5? I'm not gonna pay that.
B000LB7G00|5.0|I own two of these devices... one for my computer at home, and another for use at work (since my current employer doesn't supply this sort of device, and makes us work with the generic, cheapo Dell mice and keyboards unless we spend our own money).<br /><br />Back quite a few years ago, the company behind this created a controller called the \\"SpaceOrb\\", aka the \\"Spaceball\\".  This was, essentially a pool cue ball on a stick, which you could manipulate to achieve six degrees of freedom.  (That's three axes of rotation and three directions of movement.)  Eventually, the assets behind this technology was purchased by Logitech (who had previously had their own, less successful, mainly-oriented-towards-games device) and the current \\"puck\\" style devices came to be.  It's very similar to the old technology, insofar as the device provides both movement (by pulling, pushing, or \\"lifting/pressing\\" the puck, or rotation, by tilting it or rotating it.  It's less expensive than the old version, and seems (to me) to be a bit easier to manipulate overall, though that's a matter of personal taste I suppose.<br /><br />There are many applications where this device can be used.  It's not just useful for pure-3D applications (it can be used to pan and zoom in graphics programs like Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator, for example).  One of the most \\"fun\\" applications for using this is Google Earth, where it can be used to fly over the 3D terrain, through the 3D city streets, and so forth.  It's terrific to get a feeling for locations you're going to visit in the near future.<br /><br />I suppose there may be some applications for this in games, though I have no idea how this might work.  The MAIN role of this is for use in 3D application.  Virtually every CAD program today has full support for this (or other similar devices - and there are a few out there from other suppliers).  You can move a CAD \\"part\\" or \\"assembly\\" just by holding the \\"puck\\" in your hand and applying rotational or translational pressure on the device.<br /><br />A significant number of 3D rendering packages also have full support for this... programs like Lightwave, Maya, 3DStudioMax, and so forth.  But realize, if the program does not support 3D controllers, or if 3DConnexion hasn't provided a \\"plugin\\" to provide that support, this will not be useable (or at least, it will be very difficult to get it to do what you want!).<br /><br />There are some programs out there...  especially some game programs which were ported from consoles to the PC...  which can become confused when this is plugged in.  So, on rare occasions, I have to unplug it (otherwise, a game character may start spinning uncontrollably!)  The \\"Dead Space\\" games are notoriously bad for this, for example.  It's a trivial thing to fix, but it's deeply annoying.  It's not the fault of 3DConnexion, though...<br /><br />Once you've gotten accustomed to using this device (or any of the other devices with the same \\"core\\" controller element which 3DConnexion makes, most of which have a bunch of extra buttons in addition to the \\"puck\\"), it's hard to go back to using the mouse  and keyboard to do the same thing.<br /><br />The price is right... this device is hundreds of dollars less than the other \\"extra buttons\\" versions, and give the functionality you really need (I don't need to program \\"shortcuts\\" into the buttons, but I DO need the \\"puck\\" element!).<br /><br />One small issue...  on occasion, with earlier versions of the software, I would have USB detection failures.  This hasn't been an issue in four or five years for me, though.  But nevertheless, it's something to look out for.  If the device isn't properly detected... say, because you plugged it in before installing the drivers...  you might have occasional annoyances with getting it to work properly.  Fortunately, more recent driver versions do a pretty good job of cleaning out \\"bad\\" registry data caused by plugging it in without drivers installed.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Awesome, fun movie! I never tire watching it over and over. Great cast.<br /><br />This film is the one to watch to get in the Halloween mood.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love mincraft on Pc and think its so awesome that they have it for kindle fire. it could use some updatsles though I really want armour and more caves along with boats buckets ext.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I liked it a lot. a funny little game that is a nice change of pace from angry birds. I wish there was more levels.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I had hoped that Rowling would Wow me as she did with the Harry Potter series.  Unfotunately, though it was an interesting story, it came across as a bit lackluster.  The ending just stopped as if she was just tired of writing this story.
B000U6DU92|4.0|Before a series, even a really good one like this, get funding, the first season always has some limitations; character development, special effects (altho' not such an issue in this case), scripts and so on.<br />That being said, I think this is a great, innovative and fun series; the basic concept is actually pretty neat (ever wonder what happens to the really bright people in this country or why the DoD pays $500 for a hammer?) and almost believable.<br />Well worth a watch!  I plan on buying the entire set at some point...
B004DSX5B6|4.0|I fell in love with this at first. The blades were sharp and the extras are all in great very accesible spots. The carrying case is good, but wouldnt stand up to repeated use. Also you always have to take care when inserting the multitool as it easily gets snagged where the survival guide resides. After a couple of weeks my only gripe was that the spring actuating the scissor movement came out of the guide under the shear. I have to be careful of the amount of force I use and keep rebending it back under the shear. Other than that minor inconvenience, they are great as a back-up to other multitools or a reliable blade.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I am grateful to Pixar who have elevated animation from incipid to incredible.  Pixar remembers that you have to get the audience to care about the characters so they developed these ones very carefully.  They tell a carefully crafted story that is so original, so funny and so moving that you forget it is animation.<br /><br />I am not a spoiler reviewer so I want to say as little about the content as possible.  This is not because the content is lacking but because it is lively and robust and I want you to experience what I experienced when I pressed \\"play\\".  I think that too many people have forgotten the love of movies, just watching one without watching all the trailer.  You just watch without knowing what to expect and enjoying the ride.<br /><br />My only critique is a technical one in that I couldn't get the menu button to work so I don't know if there are any special features or behind the scenes.<br /><br />This far exceeded my expectations and runs the gambit of emotions with a witty, hilarious and sweet story that will have you guessing until the end.  I hate that most animations have in the back of their heads that there will be a sequel.  This story is the story without any pretense of sequels that can ruin the storyline.  I watched it back to back because I know that missed some of the nuances the first time and because I wanted to watch it again.  It's by far the best animation I have ever watched.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is really cool. I remember playing the original as a kid and I really like this version as well.
B007KZY1YY|3.0|Having read the Fifty shade of grey (1) which I found a bit over fetched, I enjoyed the Fity shade darker a bit more as it had a bit more of a story instead of full on sex. I am at the moment reading the next volume and so far enjoying it more than the two others.<br />Only read it as it was so much talk about otherwise wouldn't have bothered, I found it very unrealistic.
B001O22ELQ|4.0|This was really quite enjoyable, I'm glad I decided to pick it up. Plus, all 3 actors were phenomenal. Wasn't ready for all the emotions though.
B0058YPGSY|1.0|The dvd is damaged and the product is not as advertised . The DVD is choppy and continuously freezes up. I bought 4 seasons of Sons of Anarchy at one time and this seller is the only one who's merchandise was damaged and not as advertised
B009329Y30|1.0|It was too long between action with overly predictable story line and definitrly not enough romance or comedy for my liking. I would say I was drug to this once and there isn't a horse strong enough to drag me back.
B008XG1X18|4.0|only wish i could  edit boards. otherwise very good. easy  to use on a kindle. haven't  experienced a lot of glitches
B00992CF6W|4.0|pretty good but here's what it needs: armor boat minecart dispenser caves redstone dogs bucket piston and worldwide multiplater still fun and affective but still.
B0087JTAKW|1.0|I was so looking forward to reading this book because I have read all of his previous books<br />and loved them!!! This was just a huge disappointment. It reads like a folktale and I just didnt get it. I read about 60 pages and just couldn't read it anymore and got something else instead.<br />Waste of time and money. What a bummer!!
B006VGGAC4|4.0|Arnold has been THE action star many years. I knew his background for some level but book told me much more. Example that he made lot of business on real estates also was something new. Also you note that he really worked hard to gain all his goals, nothing came for free. Book was entertaining but something missing, I got feelings that he by-passed all failures and just concentrated for success. Only major \\"failure\\" mentioned on this book was end of his marriage. Also it was interesting to note that everybody knows everyone if you are in \\"inner circle\\". Good reading not so \\"deep\\" and no need to read it twice but for entertaining and spending time, perfect book...
1595827684|5.0|Filled with a detailed look at the world of Mass Effect! This book shows the evolutionary sketches that lead to the design of races, vehicles and locations. Commentary is included from the lead artist. It's amazing to see the development and things they couldn't put into the game!
1451627297|5.0|As a longtime King fan, I'm cautiously aware of his tendency to turn a 400-page story into an 800-page publication, and this is why I hesitated to begin the lengthy 11/22/63. But once I did, I was under its spell right from the start. There's real story magic here.<br /><br />The tale of Jake Epping and his forays though time (he calls it \\"going down the Rabbit Hole\\") is one that needs room to breathe, grow and take hold. The backdrop is colored with so many precise historical details that following along may seem overwhelming at times, but once you're into the story it should be quite effortless.<br /><br />In the afterword, King mentions that he conceived of and subsequently abandoned this JFK story idea early in his career due to the amount of research required. That foresight to wait has paid off. 11/22/63 is a mature novel that only a seasoned author with a patient pen could tell properly.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|i bought this for my iphone 4s, just love how it fits and does not make the phone look bulky. i will recomend this to anyone
1439127700|3.0|This insider's view of the president's club is really just a history of the American presidency from Harry Truman to the present day. It's impossible to understand why the club is so important without a detailed look at American foreign policy during the same time.<br /><br />There's a lot here, and it feels tediously too long at times, but the book did grow on me the further along I progressed. I also found a new respect for the men, all of them, who were chosen to carry the burdens of this thankless office.
0374214913|5.0|I expected \\"Penumbra\\" to be good.  What I didn't expect was for it to be a page-turner.  How I love this book!  Many reviewers have used the word \\"delightful\\" -- it is that and more.  It's filled by wonderful characters you care about -- no small feat in such a short book.  I disagree with reviewers who label \\"Penumbra\\" as appealing only to book- and computer-nerds, or librarians or any narrow reader-class.  I'm an omnivore, and I count this among the best books I've read this year:  well written, entertaining (as in I laughed out loud) but unselfconsciously \\"meaty.\\"  Believe it: All in a compact package, \\"Penumbra\\" manages to explore big questions, like what is immortality?; if there's no magic, can life be meaningful? I closed Robin Sloan's novel with a smile that persisted for hours.
B009HNCS9M|5.0|I love Criminal Minds, the characters, the situations and the way it makes you reevaluate the world around you at time. But I am reserving judgement on the new character until I have seen more.
0425263908|5.0|Eva frustrated me through out the book....I thought you stupid girl get off your high horse! I was mad at her for most of the book. Gideon was my favorite character. He is strong, secretive, and seductive. Awesome. I read it twice. Once when I first got the book, then again before I read the sequel. Much better when you can read them back to back. Lots of questions answered. The second book \\"Reflected in You\\", is a nail bitter. Loved both of them.
0525958002|4.0|I finished reading John Taylor's book last night. When he wrote about losing his mom, I teared up but when he wrote of losing his Dad, I lost it. My memories of losing my own parents came flooding back.<br /><br />It's this kind of soul baring honesty that makes this an interesting read. Throughout the book, John tells his stories from his heart and not from a pretentious rock star point of view.<br /><br />Now of course, he DOES describe his hey days and partying ways but it is done in a way that makes him sound like a regular man any of us could know. A man who albeit quite successful in achieving his dream, still wasn't happy and still had his demons to contend with.<br /><br />I read the entire book over the week-end. It's a page turner for sure.<br /><br />In the end, the book was a satisfying read but left me feeling a little Hungry. . . . ..
B0097EWK3A|1.0|I tried to install this app twice but never showed in my kindel or even the cloud but it did took some of my memory from my kindel with it. Not sure where it went but I cant find it anywhere!!! Not sure how anyone else is able to play this or if I'm the only one that this has happened to. Thank god it was free!!!!
B0083GQKQG|3.0|An important story to be understood but I didn't like the constant flashbacks and so many scenes being played out of order. I know it's supposed to evoke the sense of memory, maybe reminding us that things only seem clearer after the fact but really aren't. I really enjoyed Momento but the non-linear timeline was way more integral to the plot of that movie.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Muse does it again!  Skillfully blending the latest musical trends with classical influences, this is a fantastic album.  The lyrics feature the band's signature mix of apocalyptic prophecies with apt metaphors of life and love that always makes you think twice as you find yourself singing along.  Overall, just great.  Not to be missed :)
B009QW7HMC|5.0|i love this series, can anyone tell me if i buy a TV pass can i download the episodes to my PC??
B0018QCXH8|5.0|This movie is ridiculously awesome and Daniel Day Lewis does one of the best acting jobs I've ever seen period.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I am having a great deal of trouble reading this book. Maybe my expectations were too high because I loved the Harry Potter books. JK should stick with what she does best and that is childrens books!  I'm not sure I can even get halfway through this dull, boring book but I will try since I was dumb enough to buy it the day it came out.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy was amazing!  Suzanne Collins really killed it with this!  I cannot wait to see the film adaptations of the second and third books.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool has the potential to be a movie and,a study work for mankind's sociological,philosophical and ethical beliefs,now, and in the future. As crazy as it sounds development of this theme could create the new Hunger Games. This should not be thought of only as science fiction but a thought provoking adventure novel. I anxiously await Wool 6-10.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I haven't bought the Amazon version yet, but I have the Mac version, the Steam version, the iPhone version, and the regular Android version, so I thought I'd post a review since people are mainly judging it on price alone.<br /><br />This game is really fun. It has 48 levels divided into four chapters. The first few are pretty easy, but then they get harder. Luckily, you can skip any, unlike other games, so it's not a game you get frustrated with then put it to the side and never come back to.<br /><br />Besides the gameplay, it has beautiful visuals and awesome music. Look up \\"Kyle Gabler\\" and \\"World of Goo\\" on your favorite search engine and you'll find a page with downloads in various formats, and some track notes from Kyle himself.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Another compelling story in the Jack Reacher story. His compulsive behaviours being more fully developed to help us wend our way though a quite complex plot.Well worth a read.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Hello :). First time kindle User here. This dictionary is a good source of... words and definitions.. Will definitely use it for English class :). Ciao!
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|As usual, Lee Childs has written a good who done it.  Not my favorite but a good read. A different \\"bad guy\\" with an interesting background.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|keeps.me entertained and very addicting its a must play for me and chances to win prizes and I don't have to worry
B008673ZAQ|5.0|GREAT!!!!!  I could not put this book down, can't wait for the next one in the series to come out!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Its solitaire. Kind of leaves you....alone.....in solitude. Enjoy. Would be nice if it explained the difference in the type of &quot;deals&quot;.
B004JMY312|5.0|I had never watched this movie before this year, but we got it to watch during the Halloween season and it was a really fun, classic, kids type scary movie. It was a good story - the acting is great - and it was perfect to watch on a grey October afternoon! It will now be on our family's Halloween movie list.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I'll try to be vague and not do any spoilers.... I was skeptical about this series when I read the first book, thinking it was almost juvenile in the way it was written.  When I gave book two a chance, I decided they were worth the read afterall.  By book three I was hooked.  I still think there were juvenile parts to the writing, (I don't know many grown women who respond to EVERY stressful situation with the four letter work that Ana makes use of) but I enjoyed the mystery and \\"case to be solved\\". And, for those who cracked the cover looking for steamy scenes, you won't be disappointed.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Amazing production! I didn't think it could compete with the play, but it was excellently performed and directed!! Gerard Butler, in different form from other motion pictures, was outstanding. All other actors did not disappoint either.
B008Y2IU12|1.0|Is one of the worst movies I have seen. I would not recommend it. I suppose some people had to like it but I am not one of them.
B009GEPPYC|5.0|Love the movie! Tom Cruise was incredible in this movie and I was amazed, didn't know he could sing like that!
B000U0O9FM|5.0|Read this for a school assignment in two days. Many of explicit scenes but very informative. made mw want to join a fight club
B008NABUU8|5.0|well this is an amazing game, its highly graphical with great gameplay and great sound. beware this has to be one of the most graphic intense games out there. my droid 2 global ran it, but sluggish at times.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|It's a good story, as we expect from King, but he should have used an editor.  It's way too wordy and overwritten.  Also, for me, an unsatisfactory ending.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|No filler in this book just a \\"meat and potatoes\\" account of the life of the Navy Seals. While the book doesn't contain any \\"tactics\\" in the book, it does however capture the \\"spirit\\" of the men of Seal team six.
1439152802|4.0|I haven't been reading much fiction lately and it seems like most books I pick up I can't finish from utter boredom.  Not this book however!  Kate Morton has written another winner with wonderful characters, great narrative and twists and turns you won't see coming.  I read 3/4 of the book in one sitting because I just couldn't put it down.  Don't hesitate to pick this book up - you will definitely enjoy it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|pinterest is the most addicting app that I've ever downloaded. it's so fun and easy to use. I love that you make categories for everything so its all organized.
B005LAIH5O|1.0|This movie was a real waste of my life, and money. I couldn't believe Liam Neeson needed money bad enough that he would be seen in this movie. The computer graphics were pretty much most of the movie and stunk in my opinion. I wish I had not gone with my friends to see it but peer pressure got the best of me. If you have nothing better to do with your time and money, and really like this stuff, go ahead and try it, but don't expect much.
0786962984|4.0|As a dedicated gamer, I picked this up to play with my kiddo.  All in all, quite a bit of fun.  I think the suggested age of 8 is actually a little high.  My daughter is 6 and picked this up quite easily.  She really enjoyed looking at the \\"treasure\\" she acquired as she moved through the game.  I think boys would enjoy the visuals of all the monsters on the monster cards.  Really, its a fun and quick game that most families would enjoy.
B006LSZECO|3.0|There isn't much more I can add that hasn't been written already about this book, you will LOVE IT, it's a page turner for sure,twists and turns, husband and wife having marital problems, wife disappears, husband blamed....you think you've heard this story before?? Well, not the way it's presented in this book..I loved this book UNTIL the ending, then as my title states - I wanted to throw it thru the window ! This book is definitely worth the money, yes buy it, and be sure there is nothing breakable around when you get to end :-)<br /><br />Short Review:<br />Husband + Wife + marital problems + police = a great read but a lousy ending ! Yes even with the ending it's worth the time and price.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|This is one fantastic album.  Many reviewers are complaining that this album does not sound exactly like all other Muse albums.  While this is true, it definitely does not mean that it is bad.  I like it when a group decides to explore new styles and approaches yet keep their foundation in tact...and I believe that is exactly what Muse has done here.<br /><br />A few highlights:<br /><br />Supremacy - A nice opener with an awesome tension build....<br />Madness - Bassline is amazing as is the song....<br />Panic Station - I love the dynamic of the vocals here....<br />Survival - This song would motivate anyone....makes me want to conquer something!<br />Follow Me - Another great example (as with Madness) of Muse's musical growth and interesting new sounds.<br />Animals - Great pop song..<br /><br />...check this one out, you'll likely love it.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|i went to see this (wonderful) movie in late july of 2012.  some of the best money i ever spent!  i loved the danced scenes and the rest of the movie wasn't bad either.  i enjoyed seeing men dance and shake for my benefit.  i encourage anyone who hasn't seen \\"magic mike\\" to buy this movie!
B007THA4FI|3.0|I was so looking forward to this book.  Unfortunately, I found it boring and never finished.  I am sure some readers will love it as there are different tastes in reading material.
B008MEM24S|4.0|Very fun game just needs an update soon. Getting very boring playing the same levels over and over again. Other then that A-
B0052REUW0|5.0|I am so grateful to have read this book. I struggled with cynicism and think I never will be so tortured again. The trajectory of decline in violence imbues with energy anyone who wishes to make a positive difference.
B00000255F|5.0|Before he was married, became a multimillionare and became rich enough to be a political hack, he was cranking out songs about real people that had real soul. I don't think he will ever be able to do this again. True, he may be old to sing about barefoot girls sitting on the hood of a Dodge, but he could still write about working folks that he once related to (he is now more of a supporter of reditribution of income from working folks).  Born to Run is the place to go for great Springsteen (the next album, Darkness on the Edge, was great too as was all of his 70's albums). There really has not been a Springsteen album that I have liked all the way through since Born in the USA (1984). He is still probably better tham most, but much too political and partisan for my taste now.
B001D09OAI|5.0|This was a gift for my son who is 19.  He loves this movie and thinks it's hilarious.  He would watch it anytime it was on TV.  Now he can watch it anytime he wants. He quotes from this movie all the time.  He is a big baseball fan.
B000QRIGJY|4.0|Enjoyed the book and the struggles of Harry Bosch... Good story line and he (Michael Connelly) was able to reach back and updated you on the past... Made you want to go back a read the interconnecting book... Also gave enough in this story not to need to reach back for prior history...
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|this was a great movie, liked them all in their separate movies, even better together!  I will probably buy this movie.
B00932HEX2|5.0|One of the most politically accurate thrillers to make it on television. Wonderfully written and acted, and it raised difficult ethical and political issues. Therefore: It got canned.
B008M87GJK|5.0|This is one of my favorite, use every single day apps for the Kindle Fire. Fully customisable so that you only need see the kind of news stories that interest you. Also, coming from the BBC you know the stories are just about as unbiased as you can find. I also like the fact that once the stories are loaded you can continue reading even if you're no longer connected to the internet.
B008I3R2VG|5.0|Wonderful and stirring I really enjoy this new album from the killers. I hear them maturing and still keeping true to the roots of their sound. Buy the delux version
B0064JV4LU|5.0|It is an outstanding movie appealing to many different countries and people. The French subtitles were useful but we would have preferred English subtitles.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|apparently Kindle Fire charge ports are junk and in less than a years time u have to manuever the cord just right to get it to charge. this app shows on screen when u have got a good connection. this Christmas I'm getting the google nexus. kindle durability huge dissapointment. done with them.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I have waited for this game to come out for 2 weeks. I was disappointed when it was $2.99, but now the free one is out. This game is amazing.
B009329ZF2|3.0|Battleship was at best mediocre. The special effects were really nice but there were so many things about the plot that were left unexplained, such as \\"Why did the aliens behave the way they did\\"? Things just didn't add up.  There were lots of things like that all across the board that annoyed me about this movie.
0307959856|4.0|The characters in this book are embedded in the 1800th century society, maybe even older, since they all are close to the upstairs class.  But they are slowly released from it by the author, mystery- teller: \\" it is some centuries since we accepted that a woman has a soul. Is it not time that we accept that she also has a mind?\\" (p. 142).  This is of course a P. D. James whodunit story, but as much an attempt by James to transpose the people of Austin's universe into a kind version of the modern word. The murder, and its solution, is not more dramatic than the play between lovers when pride and prejudices are prevalent. The epilogue is probably close to a psychotherapy session for Austin's readers. But much more fun than an ordinary session.<br /><br />I believe that this kind approach is an explicit choice by James. In an epilogue to her writing process she writes: «. The younger Bennet girls, report among the trivial news that a private has been flogged, an intrusion of harsh reality into a glittering romantic and happy novel...» (p. 329). Still, \\"Death comes to Pemberly\\" is a glittering and romantic whodunit, if that is not an oxymoron.<br /><br />This is a nice way to re- read \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" for those of us who read it too long ago- or maybe thought that they have read it<br /><br />Citations: \\"He and Darcy rapidly came to the conclusion that they liked each other and thereafter, as is common with friends, accepted their different quirks of character as evidence of the other's superior intellect.\\" p. 9  \\".. \\"Arose from a belief that the validity of a judgment was in proportion to the length of the time spent in arriving at it\\"
B005LW5J9O|5.0|This was such an enjoyable ride.  Smartly written and an interesting bounce around our known history.  Very thought provoking and inspiring in the discovery of the possibilities that can happen with the smallest of choices.  Definitely read this book!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A must read story. Definitely a book that u cant put down until u finish it. Downloading number 2 now
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|I love Adobe and it's very handy when it works but some of the time it won't open and then I don't know what to do.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Love this book.  it is much sexier and more plausible  than 50 shades.  suspense and mystery keep you reading.  the sex leaves you hot and bothered
B009KHCT94|3.0|The effects were great! Storywise I'm glad I didn't pay to see it at a theater. Good popcorn B movie!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|i love this app.  hopefully they will mark down the price off the non free version. bad piggies is awesome. angry birds is not as good as bad piggies.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|On Kindle Fire - crystal sharp &amp; visually cool graphics - challenging gameplay w/out boring repetition - clever historical story format - fast / smooth / accurate response &amp; control.  Has it all &amp; it was FREE!  What a deal! GET IT !
034580404X|5.0|I'm in lust with a fictional character and if it were possible and I had a million bucks, I'd buy me some Christain Grey!
B007THA4FI|1.0|As much as I wanted to love this book, I just could not find anything to like about it. It was boring.
B0098VYP8U|1.0|I was expecting a great comedy, full of surprises or at least a drama with all the decisions someone in that position need to face, but not one thing and not the other. I kept waiting for 1.5 hr for the movie to actually start, and get some complicated characters in the mix. Not such thing. Totally disappointing. Think a potentially great story-line was wasted.
B0018ARNME|1.0|I hope its great as I will never know as I did not get the product after I bought it!!!  So where is it? Neil Young Greatest Hits?
B007FEFLTO|2.0|Very disappointed.  Since I have read some of Follet's other books, I expected to really like this but he seems to have lost a little in this book.
B0081KTI0E|2.0|I really, really wanted to like this movie because it had Daniel Radcliffe in it. I like gothic horror stories and had high hopes. Alas, throughout the picture I predicted what was going to happen next with complete accuracy--it was that predictable. The ending stunk. This was a movie more in the same caliber as something you would see on Chiller or SyFy channel on television. Boring. Not worth time or money. Gave it two stars only because of Radcliffe.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Beautiful graphics, smooth gameplay. It was challenging, creative, and kept me coming back. I played in my older Aria and my newer Vivid, but ran well. Finishing levels isn't the only challenge, there's the desire to finish perfectly, or better if you can.
B007THA4FI|3.0|This book took time to get into and felt like a long read.  It seemed hard to connect with and I had to make myself keep reading.  Predicted alot that was going to happen.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Good one needed a dictionary to chech<br /><br />on the move Good one needed a dictionary to check on the move
B00846TTDG|4.0|Very good movie about our service men and woman on what they go through in service to our country. It had a lot of action and was very well acted.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It is a fun game.I pick it up every chance I get. They give you a lot of coins over night. It is just a fun game.
B008QTVNUI|3.0|I think this is an average effort with predictable plot lines. I don't get the enthusiasm over Clare Danes, to me she is the weak link of the show. However, I watched the whole season and think the second season has thus far been better than the first.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so much fun i love it and play it all the time and there are so many games to choose from.
0525953728|4.0|I think this was a good book to read especially the last 50-60 pages...  I am glad Bin Laden is in Hell and I loved reading how they shot him in the head. Read the book.
B00000G3PA|3.0|I bought this movie off Amazon.com after not being able to find the copy I had.  I bought the new copy thinking that there would be nothing wrong with it unfortunately the sound cuts out of the movie every now and then.  Not pleasing!
B004I744AS|5.0|I love the way this app defines each word from different perspectives... and the references to different words that may relate to the one your looking in to!!! ( Love it)
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I loved this game. Good story line, even scared me a couple times. Best hidden object game I've played yet.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed this book about a mother's love.  The father of Jacob continued to deny his ancestry as a factor in development of his son.<br />He also spent a lot of time denying, lying and unable to face the truth even to the wife he loved.  After the 2nd death, the mother knew the truth<br />and so did I.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great book. It contains a lot of historical facts of Europe in the 1930's and '40's.<br />I was glued to the book. The writing style was excellant...most enjoyable book I ever read.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|What a wonderful read. I am very glad I read this classic.<br />The best vampire book ever. It is great.
B007TK77QE|2.0|I, like any other reviewers here, LOVED the HP series. The writing itself was fine - nothing spectacular, but it was the story, the fabulous story, that drew us all in. I was very excited to read her first novel for adults. Sadly, I feel as if I am still waiting for it... and I've read The Casual Vacancy. It was obvious to me from about page 2 that I wasn't going to be thrilled by it. I quickly began to recognize sentence structures lifted straight out of HP, the language level felt 'dumbed down', and twists in the plot are dealt with in a very similar way as in HP. Admittedly I am an editor, but I wasn't looking for these things. I was actively trying NOT to see them because I loved HP so much... but they just leapt off the page and slapped me in the face. And unfortunately, unlike with HP, the storyline didn't make up for the poor writing techniques.<br />CV is like The Archers (strained characterizations, sketchy subplots) on steroids. A child's book with the 'c' word thrown in. It has no real identity - it has no idea what it is or who should be reading it. I'd have edited this differently and marketed it for older teens - removing the child's death, which is totally gratuitous. It is so black that I began to sink into a depression over the week or so I was reading it in bed at night. And I read a lot of dark stuff. Thank goodness I got through it fairly swiftly - otherwise I might have been back on the anti-depressants. Try again, JK Rowling. I'll give you one more chance.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I wasn't too impressed with the first book simply because it was too much like 50 shades.  This had a better story line and I liked it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I received this book the day it was released. Wow!!! I read it in a day and a half. It was a really good read! It left me wanting to read the 3d book in the Crossfire trilogy. I was looking forward to the 3d book being released New Years Eve. Excited to read it during the football games on New years day. Now its delayed :(  The flow from book 1 to book 2 was great. Really enjoyed a very good read. Want more!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|There is no doubt this book has blown me away. Superb story, gripping and in depth characters, and a believable scenario puts it up on par with other great science fiction works. From start to finish I enjoyed this book throughly and finished all five parts in less than a week. Would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading science fiction.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Sylvia Day is an amazing author, but this book was not at all what I expected. There were parts of the book that were slow and it did not seem to have the same passion as the first book in the series. I hope the third book is better.
1569242739|5.0|I am so thankful I found this book. Lots of great stuff in it that all tastes so good! Highly recommend it.
B008NABUU8|5.0|I'm able to make bridges that slump and melt just like those found in Apple's iOS 6 maps!  Making bridges with this app helps me have a deeper understanding of the design flaws in Apple's software. I highly recommend.
B009AJDDQU|4.0|The movie was absolutely entertaining, and the ease in purchasing the movie was optimal. I rated the quality of the movie at 4 stars out of 5, but actually it should be 4.5 out of 5.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|This app is a lot of brainless fun and very addicting.  I usually give these apps the \\"can\\" test and if I'm still playing it by the end of my \\"session\\" it was a worthwhile investment.  At .99 this one's a keeper.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This one is just as good as the first.  Sorry it was the last.  Now I want to see all the movies.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book tells you the definition(s) of the word in a way you can understand and tells you in the easiest form.
B008NABUU8|1.0|playing speed is okay on my Nexus, but placing elements is finicky. i can't imagine paying this on a smaller screen! if you can't figure out.a level, it is just irritating. not even worth keeping for free.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|This is our new favorite game!  Our girls are 9 and 4 1/2, and we play it every weekend.  At first, I thought it was a little difficult for the kids (the two- and three-star cards are still way too hard for them, AND me!), but it was just difficult for me.  My left brain kept wanting to take over the building process, but the kids have no trouble at all and have gotten quite good at building and guessing.  Even the four-and-a-half year old can play.  So much fun!
B008XG1X18|5.0|love it!!!! it does everything that I want it to do. see my boards and others and create new ones real easy
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love the mystery games by bigfish I must say this is one of my favorites. I now want to play enigmatis 2!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this is one of the best games in the entire store if not the best. The creative elements to it are pheonominal! Worth the price because Minecraft will constantly update to bring you the best sand box experiance every time. I have built houses, castles, houses with castle walls, ancient temples deep underground, mob proof areas, and even after all that I still find myself adding on to them. If you want to express you inner creativity you should definatly buy this game.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This four disk set was the same price as the bluray by itself. It even included a soundtrack and free preview digital comic. Great!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is the best superhero movie of all time.  The action is great.  The special effects and characters leave you wanting a sequel and the humor make it enjoyable for the whole family.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It kept me guessing from the start.  You thought you knew where it was headed but then it would take a new turn.  I have to warn you that there is some darkness to it but it added to the plot.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Not a hard game but lots of leg work. You have to pick up an item then head way over to a spot then go way back for one thing and travel again.....over and over. Lots of times you have to stop in the middle of solving  a puzzle/event to solve something else which leads to another..etc. way before you can get back to the original puzzle. Sometimes so much time has passed that I have to use the hint button to remember where I'm at. The hint button is great.  A long game and well worth the cost. Ending leads into the next game to come.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|These books were very well written. I had never heard of Hugh Howey before but I think he will be a huge success. Anyone with a taste for sci-fi will love it! Can't wait for more in this series.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is very fun and addictive- it is hard to stop playing. I recommend this game for any age.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love finding creative ideas and keeping them organized.  pinterest iswhere I get ideas for crafts with the kids, meal ideas, holiday ideas, and even ideas for around the house.<br />The site is sometimes slow and freezes up.  The pinterest app for my kindle has helped but hasn't completely fixed it.
B004XN3FHA|5.0|I have several flashlights and this one is by far the brightest I have ever seen.  To get any brighter you need to go with multiple bulbs.  That makes the light to large for me.  This is a full size flashlight which I like.
B005H5H3LW|4.0|Space Battleship Yamato tries very hard to be faithful to the old starblazers show,80% makes it.The ending was not good for a sequel(want comet empire!)and no Desslok.However the space battles were awesome and the music as the Yamato was rising really brought me joy.A must buy for starblazers fans if only to see the great ship Yamato fly again.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Once again, Lee Child creates a real page turner.  From the opening sequence throughout the final confrontation, I was engrossed and thoroughly enjoyed each and every word.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This app worked for a short time, now I can only see maybe the first 10 posts on the newsfeed, then it goes to a blue screen which doesn't fit right on the Kindle Fire and all the posts showing are locked. Uninstalled, may try later if it appears it has been fixed<br />Adding some stars..<br />It seems like all is once again well with the Amazon FB app. All of the posts are now showing up fine and the locked blue screen is gone.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I'm so glad VOD finally got the series! I'd much rather stream videos than have to download them from iTunes.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|Excellent. Any Rush fan would appreciate this DVD, but being a Clevelander, I wish I could give it 6 stars! Hello United States! Cleveland is proud to introduce to you, RUSH !!! Thank you Donna Halper !
B002N5N4M6|5.0|The video is awesome. I love watching The Big bang Theory. After a long day at work, great to come home and relax to a great comedy show. Get it, you will not be disappointed.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|Muy buen disco, grandes temas, gran concierto no me canso de verlo, material adicional de lujo, gran edición, hasta los remixes me gustaron...
B003L77G6A|5.0|I love to watch these over and over. The humor is awesome and I even have my wife watching them now. Great DVD, fun to have when nothing is on cable.
B009GX6UZ6|2.0|I used to really love the new girl- obsessively waiting for the next episode. But now I'm annoyed. Slowly and subtly they made this all about sex and loose conduct. It used to be 25% sex but practically the whole last season and now this one is based on Jess hooking up and Schmidt's....yeeeeaaaahhh. I regret buying most of last season's and this season's episodes. $2 per ep down the drain. Way to let a good show turn into another show I'll avoid.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this app is ok but because you have to use energy that takes a while to regenerate it slows down the game too much.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|Incomplete   not one story  line complete  where is the ending    a book six is needed -if  not you‘re a stinker
B008GANNIC|5.0|I love this album I can listen to it from start to finish without having to skip any tracks. Higher, Beautiful, are the only softer songs on the album but still great songs. 'I am' is an amazing song and I have most of these songs on a workout mix.
B007OWRBJK|4.0|Book was a good read but I also thought some parts got off track and wordy so I mostly skimmed over those parts.<br /><br />Would have liked more focus on the relationship between Pete & the other members of the band.  I thought he and Roger mostly disagreed and disliked each other?  Maybe that was never true?  I thought the death of Keith Moon & John Entwistle would be more prominent and detailed and I found myself wanting more insight.<br /><br />Glad I read it but it could have been a bit better.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Flow makes you think out the box and can be rewarding when you solve the puzzle.  It gets harder but the earlier puzzles give you an idea of what to do for the latter ones.
0316228532|1.0|It's as if someone dared J.K Rowling to write a book about the most mundane topic and still make it entertaining and engaging.  Unfortunately, as talented as she is, she did not quite pull this off.  The premise of this books was very boring and the characters were dull and egocentric.  She spent far too much time developing the multipe characters in this book.  If this is the first book in a series, this could make sense, but again, I would not want to read it.  Perhaps I expected too much of her considering the magical world she created in Harry Potter.  However, I think she could have done much better with an adult book, even one not set in fantasy.
B002GYS1FO|5.0|Fantastic music...my favorite, \\"Short Change Hero\\", which I heard as the theme music for the TV show \\"Strike Back\\"..one of my favorite action series and I just HAD to have the words and music for myself.
B002NHIK1E|5.0|With the over saturation of other worldy beings in the media these days (biggest offender - vampires)  I was thinking this would be overkill.  It does have some of the stereotypical vampire profile - smug, handsome, undead, does not like sun, but the story is still very good.  If you haven't given this show a try yet - just watch the first episode, you'll probably want to see more when you are done.
B008AU7F3C|3.0|Music critics can be so demanding. Natasha Khan aka Bat For Lashes has already released two outstanding albums, some of the best singles in years and a slew of innovative music videos and yet the congescenti all claim she's still got something to prove on her third full length \\"The Haunted Man\\". Fortunately Natasha doesn't seem like the sort of person who reads a lot of her own press, so her recent declarations about almost deciding to leave the music world behind are probably completely unrelated to anything audacious the crits might have written about her. I shouldn't create too much of a jaudiced impression of how BFL's music has been received up to this point though, as she has been nominated for and won a number of prestigous awards for her previous work and most sensible music reviewers have spoken about how high their expectations for her latest album are in reference to the brilliance of what she's already been responsible for, opposed to claiming that she hasn't really got started yet.<br /><br />\\"The Haunted Man\\" features many of the trademarks that have made former Bat For Lashes projects so successful; Icy electronc flourishes, with weepy string arrangements and a bounty of lyrics that deal with love, loss and spirituality. Unfortunately Natasha hasn't been able to pull all these elements together as seamlessly this time around though, with far too many of these songs feeling underdeveloped or simply misconceived. Opener \\"Lilies\\" starts strongly with a dreamy guitar melody and some Kate Bush-y mysticism coming through Natasha's emotive singing, but then the lyrics start to take a turn for the overblown as the song progresses and the electronica that drifts in and out feels clumsy at best. The next three tracks that follow all suffer from similar problems \\"All Your Gold\\" and \\"Oh Yeah both play with some of the stuttering rhythms you might expect to find on a Santigold album whilst simultaneously attempting to enter into ballad territory, suffise to say they don't turn out too well and \\"Horse of the sun\\" although more consistent thematically and instrumentally still fails to really resonate.<br /><br />\\"Laura\\" is the first moment on \\"The Haunted Man\\" that doesn't feel tainted besides a couple of lines of cringe-worthy lyrics. Natasha's combination of soaring vocals and a delicate piano melody recall the brilliance of her previous highwater mark of balladry \\"Moon and Moon\\" and interestingly enough it's a song that almost didn't make the cut for apparently being too straight forward! \\"Winter Fields\\" and the title track also offer some redemptive moments on an otherwise disappointing album, with the former mixing sombre post classical strings and invigorating synth pop flourishes and the latter making excellent use of a male vocal choir. Closer \\"Deep Sea Diver\\" serves as the greatest illustrator as to why the \\"The Haunted Man\\" as a whole has limited impact however, the song plays with some interesting musical motifs and features some intriguiging lyricism but ultimately comes to an unsatisfying finish. Natasha Khan has far from disgraced herself on her third LP, but if reports about her spending two and a half years making this are correct, it does show that her increasing desire for perfectionism might be hurting her creativy rather than enhancing it.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Since I am such a huge fan of the Tim Burton genre, and I'm pretty sure I've seen everything Johnny Depp was in, i was really looking forward to this movie.  My opinion - it was ok.  Its not a terrible movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it just felt crammed.  I know this is based off of a 70's cult soap opera, and when you watch the movie you will see they tried to put the entire series within less than 2 hours.  I've never seen the original soap, and for those who have, you might enjoy this movie a little more, but over all- underwhelmed.  Very hard for me to say this since I love Tim Burton and Johnny Depp with just about everything.
B008XG1X18|5.0|wish it would load easier and not force close the first 5 times I try. other then that I love all the ideas of it
0446580848|3.0|Nelson DeMille is my favorite author. I've read, and in many cases re-read, all his novels. This one left me disappointed. The ending was kinda empty and it took him too long to get there. However, the information about Yemen's history and culture (?) was, as usual, very informative and wide-ranging, and reflective of the rather hideous mess the whole middle-east presents for us now and into the future.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This was a good follow up to the first book-can't wait to see what happens next and if Peeta is safe
B004ZQBOK0|5.0|Got this for my daughter for her birthday, and I have to say that they sound great to me when she's blasting this group in her room.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|A long awaited Nesbo mystery.  This is a must-read for all followers of Inspector Hole.  Very enjoyable.  Nesbo puts him through his paces in this latest book as he struggles to clear Oleg's name.
B0067EMFLA|5.0|I cannot believe how awesome this CD is.  There is not a bad song on it.  This group rocks it. My favorite songs are Pieces, The Grey and Up In Flames
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|If you are looking for a basic calculator this is it. It works great on a kindle fire, huge buttons.Works great for me and ads don't get in the way. Can't complain for free
034580404X|5.0|I Love these books...I can't wait for the author to write more....great read...I belive I read them 4 times...just can't get enough!!
B007THA4FI|2.0|I was extremely disappointed in this book.  The language was very offensive.  I wouldn't recommend itto anyone.  I expected more from her and was looking forward to her new book with great anticipation
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I read the trilogy....It was a bit much so I started to lose interest by book 3 as they were very similar...
B008TMA1LY|2.0|I got this for my granddaughter. she loves Hello Kitty so I thought this would be great way too costly.  Everytime she plays it asks for a purchase.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|This book kept my interest and was hard to put down.  Harry Hole has a knack of getting himself emotionally involved even though he hates it. This time with a boy who has been like a son to him and how he clears his name. I got this ebook for my Kindle.
B0090X4HES|5.0|You can tell so much work has gone into this album. Every song on this is perfection - the lyrics, the vocals, the production. Dr. Dre and Ali did a stellar job with the mixing, the sound quality is unmatched, it's loud and crisp and enjoyable. The guests fit perfectly. The narrative is incredibly detailed, yet easily followable. Thanks to this album's sheer density, there is something new to discover every listen. I haven't heard an album this refreshing since Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor. I'm going to have to give it the perfect 5/5.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Awesome. graphics, interesting story line and fun games make this an enjoyable game. I am looking forward. to the sequel!
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Absolutely love this movie. I saw it a few times over the summer and couldn't to own it. I'm slightly disappointed because I thought the included soundtrack was going to be the film score, which was amazing, but I've gotten over it. Currently waiting for the posters to come in, but the Digital download was a hit with friends from school. They borrowed my laptop while I was in class to finally see The Avengers for themselves.
B008NABUU8|5.0|&lt;T-Mobile Galaxy S2&gt;  As fun as it may sound to build your own bridges, it is a far challenging, which I love! this game makes you think critically about where you assemble your materials with the budget you have. its a largely trial and error game, so if you don't have the patience for things like this, I'd loom elsewhere. otherwise its a pretty awesome game!
B008J34466|5.0|I love Pink and couldn't be happier with her new CD. It<br />is her at her best. \\"True Love\\" ...contains so much truth.<br /><br />Love this!!
B009CG9LIU|5.0|My 4 year old fell in love with the Hulk after seeing the Avengers so we rented this one and he absolutely loved it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This set of books could have gone on and on.  Literally, I wish they would have.  While realizing that the story had to end somewhere, I still wish there were one or two more books to let me know that all of the remaining characters lived happily ever after. What a buy at $1.99!
B000002AGE|5.0|When I was 17 and a senior in high school, this album...on an 8 track tape...had just been released and became one of my favorites to play both in my car and at home!<br />I just got around to purchasing a CD of it...after having a cassette tape of it for several years...and, as I figured I would be, am still blown away by it. The digital mix is great and Weather Report were one of jazzest most creative groups.<br />\\"Heavy Weather\\" is one of the all time best jazz albums (of the jazz fusion era) and I highly recommend it to others.
B009IJJ712|1.0|This American attempt to update the Sherlock Holmes series might appeal to those who have never read the books or seen any of the BBC adaptions of them. I am not adverse to trying to update the series but this is whiny rather than witty, crass instead of clever, substituting P.C. platitudes for plots with finesse. Unlike the BBC re-imagining in Sherlock, which pays homage to the original and then spins the storyline in a whole new updated direction, this bears no resemblance, other than the names, to the original. NOT WORTH THE TIME. Buy the BBC series instead and see what it could have been.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|So much better than even the first one!  Can't wait until the next!  Couldn't put it down, had to drag myself away to go to bed.  A true page turner!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun time waster, I don't play a lot of games but I find myself playing this one quite a bit and my kids love it!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Yes. you can buy gems to speed things up or get special things. Do you need to? NO! If you have kids that are little, dont let them play, they might accidentally buy things. But if you are older than the age of 10 and have common sense, you will realize that companies need to make money SOMEHOW! No one said you had to get the extras. Great app. Apps are cute, levels allow new things, and the graphics are adorable. PLUS, it is FREE!!!!!
B007THA4FI|1.0|Having waited patiently for this wonderful author's next undertaking I am utterly disappointed. I have struggled through about 40% of this book and I am still wondering what the point of the whole thing is. It is the MOST BORING piece of fiction I have ever read. Don't think I can even finish it!
B004EPZ03Y|5.0|Dont get me wrong, I love all of the muppet originals as well..but this was amazing!  It tells their story and makes you feel like you're a kid again- and when they play \\"Rainbow Connection\\" oh brother, give me the tissue box!  I just loved this movie, everything about it.  And the original songs were awesome, hilarious and just utterly ridiculous in the right way.  I've been a fan of Segel since \\"Freaks and Geeks\\" and he did wonderful with this project.  Amy Adams was perfect, too.  The shots of Jim Henson and the \\"old\\" muppet references was spot on, well done!  The muppets were a huge part of my childhood...even now, my cats name is Fozzie.  Gotta love them- and I will be buying this movie to add to my collection!
B008TMA1LY|5.0|Such a cute game! Many different Sanrio characters also appear in the game. Reminds me of Supermarket Mania app I tried before.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I was anticipating a lot of empty sex scenes but was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the plot. Still kind of silly but I enjoyed the psychological aspects of the book.
B0085SO2I0|5.0|Great episode! I'm new to the series and just started randomly sampling episodes.  This is a great show and I can't wait to watch it again.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|draw something is great for friends who like to play together. as is scramble with friends you see. with friends! you should get this app!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is awesome!!! I loved it. Can't wait for the next one to come out.  It is an easy and intersting read.  It picks up where the first one left off.
145162445X|5.0|This book does not exactly answer the question, Why is there something rather than nothing?<br /><br />But it is very intriguing and very well-written.<br /><br />First, Krauss insists that \\"Why\\" questions are seldom if ever useful in science--the useful ones are mostly \\"how\\" questions.<br /><br />And this is a book of \\"how.\\"  Krauss clearly explains HOW particles are popping into and out of existence all the time.  He further explains how all the \\"empty\\" space we know isn't really empty, but full of potential particles and energy.  On top of that, he explains how a universe such as ours, with space in it such as ours, not only could but must have expanded exponentially from a subatomic beginning into the 27-billion-light-year-wide (and expanding) universe that we know today.<br /><br />As for UTTER emptiness, with neither potential energy nor potential matter, he says nothing of it, since such a thing does not exist now.  He acknowledges it as a thought, but not as a reality.<br /><br />He further (intriguingly) asks the question: given the many parameters of our universe, fairly fine-tuned, could a universe exist with different laws of nature?<br /><br />Unequivocally, he says Yes, though he doesn't at all like this answer.<br /><br />Apparently (though there is as yet no direct evidence for this), our universe is just one of a multiverse--a myriad of universes that either have come into being or could or will.<br /><br />His view of the end of our universe--cold, bleak, static, lifeless--he finds depressing, but I doubt too many others will, since (a) it is billions, perhaps trillions of years off, and (b) as Krauss himself explains, why worry any more about what happens to us after death than we worry about what happened to us before our birth.<br /><br />All in all, an eye-opening, very accessible work.
0525958002|5.0|It's been a long time since I finished a book in one sitting...and I read a LOT of books.  But this one felt like it was written by someone I knew. As John's life unfolded in those pages, so did mine.  I remembered sitting in front of our giant console TV, counting the minutes until the Rio or Hungry Like the Wolf video would come back on (as thrilled as I was to see them on that boat...now I know he just as thrilled to be there).  I remembered saving up my babysitting money to buy the first album from the record store in the mall (the one with the brown jackets...I had to special order the original with the car--now I know that JT hated that pic that I loved so much).  That picture on Page 158?  I had that on my wall (and always wondered why Simon, Nick and Roger were wearing the same shirt..now I know!).  Every chapter brought back sweet memories of some very special years...before everything got real.  They got really real for John Taylor, too--those realities are the best chapters.  As he describes the band making big decisions that would break them apart (if only temporarily), I remember making decisions, too (college, marriage), and leaving DD behind--always, however, remembering them fondly.  With this book, my Duranie passion has been rekindled.  I love them all again.  But this time, I can respect them as real people, not worship them as mythical figures.  I respect them for being husbands/significant others, and responsible parents, and for hanging on to the careers and friends they love.  As reviews go, this one probably won't make the average person buy the book... perhaps because I haven't referred to the sex, drugs and alcohol that are de rigueur with the \\"rock star memoir\\" (even though they are all here in this book, too). But if you loved--or even liked--Duran Duran, buy this book.  And by \\"book\\" I do mean BOOK and not the electronic version.  It's well worth it for the photos; even the iconic photo of JT shaking hands with Princess Di is included (Ialways LOVED that shot of him...his awe seemed genuine to me).  And don't expect a generic, grade-school level of prose.  John Taylor can write.  Seriously.
B004NS710C|5.0|This is a very good action packed movie. The actors do a fantastic job. Scenery is great and the locomotive on full power and no engineer or conductor is great. Lazy guy starts it all and from then on your on the edge of your seat. Just the time you think it's stopping, great it's off again. Definitely not a waste of time or money as I've watched it at least 4 times and still enjoy it. Nice addition to your library.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Hi, my names Mark and have just finished reading Bigger Leaner Stronger! I have always been involved in some kind of strength activity since a very young age, either bending horseshoes, tearing cards, phone books, 8mm bolts in front of parties etc)), I have also taken part in Karate and Judo for 10 years and also training for Arm Wrestling comps, can deadlift 140kg with 1 hand(no strap)and pinch 80kg etc. (Note that I have never followed a specific weight training routine) Im 6ft and a strong 155lbs (lean) and have found it extremely difficult to put on any kind of weight and decided to get BIGGER!! From reading this BOOK I've been taking it very seriously for the last month, writing in my diet and training journal constantly! Hitting at least 3,500 cals a day sometimes 4k and even near 5k, carbs around 350g and 250g protein with around 80g fat per day. Due to the fact I've learnt alot from this book it inspired me to go even further and research every single little thing that came into my mind about nutrition, routines, muscles, tendons, weights, form, complex/simple carbs--everything!!And now I'm steadily putting on weight for the 1st time and really increasing the weight in all exercises....my Flat Bench has increased by 15kg in just over 3 weeks, NO joke!<br /><br />You should read this book, even if your an \\"experienced\\" weightlifter it will benefit you somewhere in your routine!<br /><br />Excellent book!!<br /><br />Mark

B009UR2OJO|4.0|Joan Collins was the woman everyone watched on DYNASTY, an evening soap which ran a few decades ago. Madeline Stowe has donned that mantle as the matriarch everyone loves to hate as Victoria Grayson in REVENGE. Whenever she is on camera with another character, you know the claws are coming out!  I especially like it when her ex husband gets into it with her. They can't stand one another and just spit and claw at one another when forced to be in the same room, which is frequently.<br /><br />Emily, our revenge prone protagonist, is actually a little tiresome in comparison. Her harping on and on about her revenge is turning everyone off. However, what is taking over as an issue for her, which may take over the revenge plot, is that her mother has now appeared.  She is played by Jennifer Jason Leigh. I am really looking forward to seeing Stowe and Leigh come together.  That should be fun, especially since Stowe was the one who stashed her in the nut house.<br /><br />I actually did not think I would like this but Stowe made me a convert.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|while I wish there were more coins I think it would take some of the fun out of it. so much mindless fun!!
0316228532|1.0|I have read all the HP series, several times, seen the movies several times. I looked forward to JK trying something different but I find the book very tedious and boring - I have had it for nearly two weeks and haven't even made it to page 100 and probably won't. If it were a library book, I would return it. I will try to slog through it but I don't think I will change my opinion. If she wants to write mysteries, try in the vain of Nancy Drew or the Hardy Boys, she writes about kids very well.
B00992CF6W|4.0|the controls are better than blockstory but it still needs some more things added like lava caves and more kinds of mobs
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Good game..would have gave it a five star. but takes to long for coins to regenerate ..And don't plan on buying them.  so don't play that often..
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great sequel to Bared to You. Find it hard to put them down, but don't want them to finish. Worthy competition to 50 shades. They are closely written & have many similarities (Gideon Cross (GC) & Christian Gray (CG), billionaires, dominating personalities) but still recommend reading them both. Like how Eva has a past. Ana, in 50 shades, is a bit of a \\"goody two shoes\\"
B0071XO8RA|5.0|These books were so good! Thank you, Amazon, for once again making something available to me that I never would have known about otherwise. I love well written science fiction and this definitely qualifies.  Plus, the descriptions of the places and the character development were incredibly well done. Each character was definitely believable. Yes, it was science fiction, but the plot was totally believable. This could be our future. Also, it was written without depending on make-believe technology to explain things or to move the plot along.  The technology was the same we are using today. I won't even hint at what it was about because I don't want to spoil it for you, but I will tell you that once I started it, I couldn't put it down. I'm 64 years old, so I've read a lot of stuff, and this was one of the best. The author deserves to be picked up by a major publisher. Wool deserves to be made into a movie or TV series.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Wonderful film, close to the book, with a few extra surprises.  Can't wait for the next one.  Awaiting the next one, the new Twilight.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|From start to finish I enjoyed this omnibus.  I loved the main character and how she was developed. I hope the author keeps writing.
B00127RAJY|1.0|Been doing these workouts practically every day for 3 months. Felt good, lost about 5 pounds & started toning. However, started seeing brown squiggles and flashes of light out of my right eye a week ago. I am very nearsighted. Went to my eye Dr. & was referred to a retina specialist for a possible tear in my retina! They told me I have a vitreous detachment & it can lead to holes in the retina or a detachment of the retina. The vitreous tear caused bleeding in the eye that is resulting in the cloudy vision right now. It has been a week and no let up. They couldn't say for sure that the DVD caused my eye problems but they did tell me not to do the workouts anymore. They said the intense jumps/jump training could be enough to cause the vitreous at the back of the eye to tear away like mine has. No retina tear as of today but they said I am not out of the danger zone. Still having cloudy vision a week later and intense brown floaters so bad I don't feel safe to drive. Going back in two days to be rechecked for retina tearing. My opinion is this, if you value your eyesight, avoid this DVD at all costs!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm so happy they made this app on the kindle fire! This is the bestest game ever! I also like the game block story!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy app to use and nice big display. Great for on the go, too. Definitely worth the download for sure!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I don't have any problems with it. lots of fun. It is easy to play. I enjoy relaxing to this game.
B00333IA1M|5.0|this is a classic of french literature so it is a must you should read. it is concise and precise.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I'm surprised by the number of crashes people seem to be having. this app has never crashed on me once and I've had it for a few months now. the plans are great, the audio option is useful and I really like being able to make notes and color code them. I don't like writing in real books so this option is great.<br />only problem is having to be on the net to use it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I was 22 and working in a tv station when Kennedy was actually shot. SK recaptured the feel of that era beautifully.  He swept me back.  Pencil skirts and bobbysox.  Cars with continental kits and fender skirts. Innocence. The story was rivetting and so like it was the first time....  Another King masterpiece.
B009329Y30|5.0|This story could very well be true. It demonstrates what love can do to bring together two people who come to care for each other deeply in spite of circumstances.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|This story makes you not want to put the book down.  Lots of twists. Can't wait for the next one.
B008NABUU8|5.0|Played through first 3 levels with no issues. Load time is about 10 seconds for a level so yeah a little long, but not worth taking a star off for.  Having played Simple Physics and other similiar games I thought the controls are very intuitive.  Graphics are simple but a notch better than several of the other building games.  You can zoom in and out and snap to grid works great so again don't understand reviews commenting on visibility of pieces or no snap to grid.  Definitely worth more than free app of the day.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I didn't believe the story was very believable.  How needy was Nick to accept Amy back in his life after discovering what a nut-case she was and all the people she had taken advantage of thru her manipulative ways.  You'd have to sleep with one eye open the rest of your life, knowing she was capable of murder.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Very easy to download a YOUTUBE video to save as MP4 -- Thanks for this product that we don't even need any more internet access all the time
B00943SQCI|5.0|As a fan of the original series I am struck by the differences between the presentation.  The Original Dark Shadows series was not a comedy.  But, I thought this movie was pretty good, it kept me involved and I watched it through to the end, I often lose interest if the storyline isn't intriguing.
B009B50QOU|4.0|¡UNO!, Green Day's 9th studio album, is a force to be reckoned with. Green Day returns back to their punk rock roots, as numerous songs appear to be vintage Green Day. The beginning songs are catchy, the ending songs show the true heart, determination, and grit that go along with every Green Day album. I can't wait for the rest of this trilogy (Dos and Tres) to hit shelves.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I got the first book for free and right after finishing it I purchased the rest. It was not a typical read for me, I prefer dark thrillers, but I absolutely loved these books and recommended to all my friends. I think they'll enjoy them too.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Good story but seemed a little strung out. Not as dark as everyone seems to think. Had to keep reading just to get to the plot.
B008JTXJ0M|5.0|The writers of this show have a completely twisted mind and are awesome writers.  Its four high school girls that keep getting into a more and more trouble.  Every time they think they are getting ahead of \\"A\\" , it just gets them into more of a mess.  Love every episode!!!!!!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great book!  NOTHING like 50 Shades!  This book had great dips and turns and I can't wait for book 3 to find out what happened to Gideon!!!
B003XF1OJK|5.0|super good book, was intrigued the entire way, want slow to me, highly recommend it, it's the first book that can tithe you into the halo universe.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I started using this app as a backup to my desk calculator. My desk is clearer now as desk calculator is now the backup.<br />My thanks to the developers.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This works great.  Nice large size adds to the quickness. However, no sound to know if the key was hit without looking.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Quite possibly the most inspiring book or even publication that I've ever read.  THESE are the stories that fail to make it into the news.  It takes personal books and memoirs to truly tell the tale of the fighting and struggles going on in Afghanistan and Iraq.  I may even go so far as saying this is required reading for schools.  It doesn't promote war whatsoever (which is I'm guessing the one gripe that people maybe would have with it) and in fact does quite the opposite.  It goes much deeper than a battle fought on a remote Afghanistan mountain top.  This shows how resilient the human spirit is and that deep down, through all of the religion, culture, and customs that are found in the world, we are all just human beings trying to make it in this world.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The book was good very good in fact but the ending seemed to me a little rushed I'm sure lots of readers were expecting more from the ending
B009B50QOU|5.0|Loved it. Classic Green Day. Up beat and energetic.  I'm a power pop/roots rock fan.  Favorite bands include the Kinks, John Hiatt and the Black Keys.  Looking forward to Dos? and Tre!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Found myself completely addicted to this game. Spent hours playing. Finally beat it. Going to have to have more like it. A lot of running back and forth, but well worth the time entertained.
B007L6VR12|5.0|First, let me get something out of the way: I'm a brainless Wes Anderson fan and couldn't possibly offer you an actual review of this movie.  I'm a hipster twit who would love this movie even if it were just a blank screen for 2 hours, etc., etc.  If you don't like Wes Anderson's films, and he is entrenched in his style enough that you know what that means, please save yourself the frustration of reading my review...because I do like Wes Anderson and I won't respond to any comments along the lines of the above.<br /><br />I don't think Anderson is a one note director even though there is no debate that his films all share a particular feel, style, and tone.  When the opportunity presents itself in this film, quite a bit of it takes place outside in larger spaces, his typical meticulous mis-en-scene is showcased.  The dialogue is as spare, direct, and tight as ever.  Some people apparently find this off-putting since the two leads are children...I think this betrays a lack of familiarity with Anderson (maybe more, but at least this) since he has always handled children /as they are/ - as young adults.  I mentioned RT in the title because I think it is the closest to MK in terms of emotional tone.  There is a desperation in all of these characters that cuts through my defenses as a viewer.  I won't deny being a willing audience, but I have no trouble finding my way into each moment.  Finally, to wrap up the general stuff, there is a touch of the fantastic in Moonrise Kingdom that seems like a holdover from the Life Aquatic - but I don't think it is central to the film and it doesn't change the overall tone.<br /><br />This is an adventure story, and a love story, and an escape story...at times it's tragic, at times funny, at times awkward, and it's almost always exciting.  In short this is a movie about being a young (pre-)teen.  The leads are in that embarrassing moment in which hormones, desire, and passion meet with inexperience.  They are isolated from the world in many ways and alienated from their peers and most of the adults around them.  It's the two of them against the world.  And the really lovely thing about this film is the way they succeed.<br />The adults are all disconnected from the children to different degrees (for different reasons), but one of the many exceptional things about the film is the way that each adult is a foil for the leads.  One easy example is the failed marriage of Suzy's parents contrasted with the feverish and indomitable love between Suzy and Sam.  As is always the case with Anderson, not a moment or exchange is wasted or empty.<br /><br />I'd like to say more about the movie, but it would really be best for you to just see it.<br /><br />Product note and two tangents:<br />- The blu-ray release is very fine in terms of picture and sound, but many fans will find the lack of additional features somewhat disappointing.  I am sure that a future release (Criterion maybe) will include such features.  In the meantime this bare-bones release will either sate your appetite for the film, or just seem like a money grab, etc.  I'm not disappointed enough, or cynical enough, to feel cheated...and besides, I don't want to wait...<br />-  If you're on the fence about this film because you've heard that there is something voyeuristic, pornographic, or indecent about Suzy and Sam's relationship (a particular scene really seems to have bothered some viewers)...please do yourself a favor and put that out of your mind.  I have no idea how anyone could find this so offensive...I could venture a guess, but it would be very mean...if you live in a world in which teenagers do not think sexual thoughts, utter sexual sentences, or do sexual things, then you may very well be offended.<br />- Along the same lines, if you're on the fence because you've heard there is gratuitous violence against an animal...please put that out of your mind also.  If you think a good film CANNOT portray an animal being harmed, then you will not think this is a good film.  If, instead, you think that a film can portray an animal being harmed as part of a larger story, as part of a particular moment in a character's development, then you should not hesitate to watch the film on this account.  For anyone suggesting that the death is unnecessary, callous, or in poor taste, I implore you to watch the film again and consider this moment more carefully.  Some people have pointed to RT - since an animal dies in that movie as well - and drawn a larger conclusion about Anderson's lack of concern/care for animals.  I worry that these people are not watching the films...these deaths are catalysts for the story, triggers for changes in certain characters, and are deeply emotional moments.<br /><br />Of course, this film is not for everyone.  The leads are children, but the film is not for most children.  If you have a strong opinion about Wes Anderson, let that be your guide.  I think this is Anderson's best since the Royal Tenenbaums and I cannot break the tie between them for my favorite of his movies.
B008NABUU8|2.0|Okay, I'm a huge fan of bridge building games and this does have something the others don't, offering a 3D feel, but the load times make this unplayable. What a shame too because visually this was impressive, but as soon as I realized that I'll be waiting forever to play it, I chose to just download a different app all together that I know is faster.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Just what I have come to expect from these musicians.  This cd is fabulous.  I  listen to it all the time. I recommend it.
0525953728|5.0|I could not put this book down! The writer made me feel I was there.....well almost. I will read this book again and I know I will find that I missed some tidbits of data. If you want to know, what I believe, to be the truth about the mission from someone who was there, then you have to get this book. The author seemed genuine and that he cared about how he was presenting the facts. It was easy to follow and the pictures in it helped me visualize the story.....I kept referring back to the charts and drawings. GREAT book!
B008XG1X18|4.0|works about 90% of the time. a few glitches yet to work out. for example, the &quot;re pinned&quot; notification (not to mention, it shows a plain black box) will randomly appear even if I didn't pin anything.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|This is such a unique movie! What makes it different is that it has actors that are not actors; they are real active Navy Seals.....Wow....you don't get more unique then that! They aren't the best actors but what they do and how they do it, makes up for their lack of experience in acting. The action keeps you at the edge of your seat and at the end you are taken to the reality of what these men and their families face! I just hope that the people who put this movie in play, will make another movie just like this one. Thanks for giving us a glimpse into the lives of these incredible men and the special women that pray they always come home.
1932100660|5.0|Just coincidence that I finished reading it just as I learned my father has advanced stage prostate cancer - (he's always been a large quantity milk drinker...)???<br />I am going to do this!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved all three books. Read all three in a month. I was extremely sad I finished them, and have told everyone that they do need to read this trilogy
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Great show. Watched all 4 seasons in 2 weeks. Highly recommended. Wish the seasons lasted longer than 13 episodes. Hope this keeps getting renewed.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|The Adapter works great, much easier than trying to use an adapter with my laptop computer.<br />I use it for testing HDMI ports on TVs and is very handy
B0098VXE50|5.0|Surprised! I didn't think I would like it as much as I did. Very entertaining, well paced and exciting! Great special effects! Would watch again :)
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|The game is a pretty standard match three puzzle game, but has exceptional artwork, and a cool story, and ( due to some of the neat power-ups ) a few added challenges.  The remaining time doesn't give you much points, which is good for me because I like breaking blocks, which earns you the most points by the end of the puzzle.<br /><br />The story is actually pretty cool, and the voiceover is a really nice effect.  The storyboards are really stunning, though, and the game is really responsive, and a really fun puzzle game.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I used to be a book reviewer for the Sacramento Book Review. We got paid in books, which is my favorite type of salary as long as there is already a roof over my head, and food in the fridge. Therefore I really should be putting in the effort to leave a more businesslike review. Unfortunately, for the review, but fortunately for me, I have a 15 month old on my lap trying to touch the screen on my tablet, so it's lucky that I have been able to make it thus far.<br /><br />That being said, I liked this book so much that it has booted Hugh B Cave's book The Dawning out of first place in my list of favorite dystopian stories. I have purchased the prequel, plus Hurricane since it sounded very interesting to me, and I now anxiously await any future chapters of the Wool series.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|Good story line, but parts go too slow, easily put down,  I normally like trilogies, but this first book although correct on history, has more than a few rather dull spots!
B0086700CM|5.0|hay this games so cool don't lesson to tolhose STUPPED people out there who call this game STUPPED git it
B008PE9GSA|4.0|Right down the ZZ line.... good solid rock delivered just right. Good quality sound that is easy to listen to. Glad to see that the Boys still have the energy.
B008NABUU8|4.0|This is a fun game. I am really enjoying it so far. Got it on the free promotion, and I played it all afternoon.
B007MB5OCE|2.0|Advertised as being very funny. Not so! Extremely repetitive, nothing to maintain my interest. Key character very sad soul. Forced myself to finish the book.
B0090OW7J4|5.0|I've been a big Hiatt fan since \\"Bring the family\\".  There have been some misses but mostly hits since then.  \\"Mystic Pinball\\" definite hit. I have enjoyed from start to finish. Wood Chipper to No Wicked Grin all good.
B00913P6G0|5.0|Defiantly the best album of the year.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Very personal recordings of his parents<br />The theme of the album, and how he stuck to it<br />Production<br />And Everything about Kendrick Lamar<br />Deluxe edition songs are probably my favorite - Black Boy Fly is really powerful.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Not enough songs!! I just blew by the album and i want more, it's addicting.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app makes Pinterest so easy to use. You have access to everything that you have on the normal web site.
B009GEOLM4|5.0|Nice, watched 3 times. new characters. extraordinary, good storyline, no Kevin Conroy. can't wait for part 2, A must see, enjoyable to watch
1451627297|5.0|This is now one of my favorit going back in time love stories. UP there with Time and time again.
B0054SMID0|5.0|An honest lawyer,with heart.Loved this movie.Enjoyable all the way through.Made me sad when Frank was killed. Matthew is a great actor.
B005LAII1C|1.0|This is dick and fart humor of Adam Sandler quality. If you are a 12 year old boy this is your fav. Story is garbage could have been good but nothing but shock factor. Mr Family guy needs to quit a drugged out teddy bear with a Boston ascent a full length movie.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app, it has become a must to my morning routine .. I don't wake up until I hear the rooster crow!!  I love how its so loud and annoying, just what I need to get up!!
B007THA4FI|1.0|Struggled through it.  Ms. Rowling built a large cast of disfunctional characters in her little township.  The ending made you wonder why you even cared what happens to them.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is amazing. I get so sucked in that I feel like I'm really there! You should definitely read it!
B0091XRTTM|5.0|Charles Darwin and Queen Victoria as you've never imagined them....<br /><br />It's a very English film, which is perfect for an English/Anglophile family. I'll forgive it the few minor PC concessions - the second-rate change of title for the US market, the leper ship which mysteriously changed into a plague ship (plague victims with leprosy?) - in view of the string of wonderful gags from the whale to the sea monster.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is awesome I would get it if I we're you! It has so many games on one app.
B008XG1X18|5.0|all I can say is I love pinterest! this app works really great on my kindle fire. it took me a little while to get everything figured out.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Adam has soul and that was obvious when he did A Change Is Gonna Come, the very first time.  This album is different than all the boring same ole Pop albums out there.  It has an element of funk and sass. The more upbeat songs have been used by so many dancers because they just make you want to move.  It also has some really amazing examples of Adam's heart and soul from the inside out in his slower or more thoughtful songs. Well written and put together album. Love it!!
B000T433CO|3.0|I thought this movie was cute, I can't really say i enjoyed Jack Black's story line but Jude Law and Cameron Diaz definitely made the movie worth watching.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Awesome read for book 2 of the series. Moving on to book 3 with much enthusiasm. If you've read book 1 and/or have seen the HBO series, than my testimonial isn't needed :)
B007TML4EI|5.0|This game is fun and unique but it does get very difficult very fast other wise I give it 5 stars

B00008GKEG|5.0|I was lucky enough to be able to see this when it aired on television almost 20 years ago. After watching the newer George Harrison documentary, I decided to give this one another look, and I'm glad I did. This set is even more special when you remember that George left us less than ten years after it was produced. The stories they tell are interesting, as well as the fact that they don't all remember things the same way (especially funny is the fact that Paul says he doesn't want to take credit for the creation of Magical Mystery Tour).<br />I bought this set used, and all the DVDs played fine except in one spot: at the end of the segment about Brian Epstein's death, a picture of Epstein appears on the screen along with his years of birth and death. My DVD stops dead in that spot. At first I thought it was dramatic effect, but it went on for too long, and I had to restart the disc again to go on to the next segment. Very strange and spooky.<br />I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a Beatle fan, or even those who just like history or are curious about the '60s. The Beatles changed our culture in so many ways that people should hear them talk about the phenomenon in their own words, and not just read those of third parties who were not there.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Had to keep from watching all the episodes in one eve. I downloaded the series for Kindle and anxiously awaiting Season 2.
0345529057|5.0|I just started the series and I love it. The first couple chapters of the first book are a tad slow, but it picks up immediately and it's hard to put down. I'm really looking forward to getting the next installment in the series.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|this was an easy read. interesting premise. it could have used a little more development of the characters so you have more invested in them. was able to read this over the weekend for a quick escape.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I have been using this app on my kindle fire ever since I got to grad school to read and annotate journal articles.  It is super easy to use and I am loving it so far.  Plus, no more paper waste or printing cost!  Well worth the money.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game app is the best I could play this all day that is if I didn't have work almost everyday. lol
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is my newest time waster. So many good ideas!  I could (and do) spend so much time on here.
B005XN0SGU|4.0|(well, it would have been Comixology but Amazon ruined it)<br /><br />The only real downside to this app is that the settings are hard to manage. I still haven't figured out why the screen stopped adjusting when I tilt the device. it's a pain to read with the power cord facing down.
B007THA4FI|2.0|This is not anywhere near the quality of the HP writing Rowling has done.<br /><br />It was vulgar when it wasn't necessary and, overall, depressing.<br /><br />I was quite disappointed.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|WOW what an additive game! Ive played lots of addicting games befor but nothing this cool. Download right here right now!!!  ;)
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|In a post-apocalyptic future the world is taken over by poisonous fungi. The remaining humans live near the plants and try to prevent their spread. In the valley of the wind princess Nausicaa lives with her father the King. Their warmongering neighbors have a terrible plan that threatens the peaceful valley of the wind. Nausicaa must find her hidden potential and save their home.<br /><br />This is a great movie. It has lots of great characters and good drama. The voice cast is also good, just like all the other Miyazaki films. It amazes me that this isn't even one of his better films. but it's still a masterpiece. Any anime fan should love this movie. If you like Nausicaa then check out these other Miyazaki films: Spirited Away, Castle in the Sky, Howl's Moving Castle, My Neighbor Totoro, Whisper of the Heart, Grave of the Fireflies, and Kiki's Delivery Service.
B008XNZMOU|3.0|I am a big fan of her since day 1 and she is just getting worse and worse each album. I am a person who will not be bias doesn't matter how much I like an artist; I am a big fan but that will not cloud my judgement.<br />I don't understand why MANY artists release albums with about 30-40% good songs and the rest are crap. Same story with taylor swift's Red album. Only 5 songs that are actually good and she is becoming way more pop than country.<br />Besides music, she is definitely great in personality; releases one of her new songs every week a month before album release. She also does a lot of exciting status on facebook and twitter which I thought not many artists would do.<br />My recommendation,<br />If you are a \\"huge\\" fan - buy her album.<br />If you like her music - preview her songs on itune and get them individually.<br />If you are on a budget but you like her music - save your money and get it through your friends.
B009DP9D6A|5.0|Overall, it's a great album. Nice progression with the overall style. It is missing the Video version of \\"Professional Griefers\\" with the extended lyrics, which I felt was a better version than what's on the album.<br />Favorite song - The Veldt. Google that and read the Story, then listen to the song again. Chilling.<br />I give it 5 stars because there's not a single song on there I don't like, and for any mau5 head, this is a MUST have!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I got this app for the new kindle fire hd 7&quot; and it works great! It tells me the percentage my battery is charged to, how long it will take to fully charge; and, one of my favorite aspects of it is that it breaks it down into how much battery life  you have to use per application. For  instance, if fully charged, you have, let's say, 11 hrs 52 min to read. Or, if your battery is charged at 67%, you can play a 3 D game for 2 hrs (these r not exacts, just examples to show the features). I just really love that feature because even tho I LOVE my kindle, its very disappointing how long it takes to charge and it's impossible to kno if ur battery's fully charged w/out this app. I'm thrilled this is free as not too many great things in life r!  But, when I have the xtra $, I am DEFINATELY giving these developers the 2 bucks for full version-they certainly deserve it!<br /><br />P.S.  My other fav about this app is u can pick whatever color u want ur battery pic to b; and, in a wide range of hues-super cool option!
0385344333|1.0|Alright, I knew some of Reacher's peculiarities before I started reading this one, but they still always come as surprises, and make me wonder why I weakened and started reading another Reacher story.  But for people with nothing much to do (that's me), it fills up the time.  Some of Reacher's most ridiculous actions are here, including his assertion that if you divide 1 by 81, you get an endless series of 1234567890/s, over and over.  Fact is, you don't even get one.  Divide 1 by 81 and you get 123456790, and where's the 8?  OK, sure, picky, picky, but Reacher's a mathematical genius, and should know better.  There are other numerical figure phenomenon, as well, but look for them yourself.  Most phenomenal of all, almost funny, is Reacher's final explanation of what all this has been about, a group of Syrians doing banking business. How did he come to that conclusion?  Sorry, we're not told.  But for this our friend Reacher invades their stronghold and one by one kills 24 of them!  That's 24!  (His friend Delfuenso has the best line in the book.  She killed the other two, so she observes that it was a good day, because she got to kill two crooked bankers.)  SO, if you want some diversion, read Mr. Child's latest work, but be prepared.

B007GCY8FS|3.0|I had been hoping that Lee Child had not killed off Reacher in the previous novel (not counting the return to his military days), but I wound up disappointed by this one.  While I know the action is what these novels are all about, there has always been a layer of thought within them as Reacher figures out what is going on.  In this book that layer seems almost rote rather than having depth. Also, a little more explanation of how he got away last time would have been nice. Did Child realize that there were people like me out there hoping for a return from Reichenbach Falls and toss something off quickly?  It's good enough to read and enjoy, but not his best.

0316227706|5.0|Underwater Dogs is full of breathtaking imagery.  Seth really has a special talent for capturing these special moments.  It's a great coffee table book or gift for people of all ages.  Highly recommend.
B0012NO316|5.0|A cinematic tour-de-force in every sense of the term. All four characters tear the screen apart with the most explosively real performances I've ever seen. It is hard to find a legitimately well-written play, and even rarer to find a decent adaptation of it. This film does both with a bang. It's not an outright horror film, but every bit as scary as one, for one reason. The characters and the situations are unmistakably real.

B000SEIK2S|5.0|When I decided to update '[[ASIN:0978135776 Echo of a Distant Planet]],'I looked for similar books to get some ideas. Scalzi's book is the best-of-the-best when it comes to military science fiction. It held my interest all the way to the end, and I give it 5 thumbs up for an excellent read.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Fun game but several problems with it.  First it keeps stalling and I have to shut down my Kindle to get it working again. Second, there should be more ways to get gems or tokens to play the Kung Fu Scrat mini game to win Acorns.  That is about the only way to get Acorns unless you buy them and I won't spend money on them. Third, it is too easy to accidently buy land when you don't want to, you should be able to return land if you have nothing on it.
B008R9QAY6|5.0|The story of Artaserse as written in libretto by Metastasio is the tale of a Persian King Artaxeres. Though there are over 40 known settings of Metastasio's text, the libretto was first set by Leonardo Vinci (1690-1730) in 1730 for Rome.  And it is this setting of the perils of the Persian King that is featured in this rather amazing showcase of countertenors from around the world.  The text was also set by such composers as Gluck, JC Bach, Hasse, Galuppi, Myslivicek and Arne, but it is the original setting that gathers the most historic musical attention.<br /><br />The opera is a string of florid pearls - arias so complex yet so penetratingly beautiful that it would seem after this recording that opera houses will begin to pay attention to the work. Of interest a French scholar, Charles de Brosses, wrote 10 years after Vinci's death from poisoning, `Vinci is the Lully of Italy: true, simple, natural, expressive, writing in the most beautiful, uncontrived way for the voice ... Artaserse has a reputation as his finest work, and one of Metastasio's finest too ... It is the most famous Italian opera.'  And that is fine preparation for the performance captured here.<br /><br />Diego Fasolis conducts the Concerto Cologne in a completely authentic manner. At the time of the composition of Artasere, a papal decree banned women from appearing on the stages of the city's theatres, so the entire cast was male, with the female roles sung by castrati. This recording not only recognizes that bit of significant history, it honors it with the challenge of single-sex casting with a spectacular line-up of fine countertenors from around the world: Croatian-born Max Emanuel Cencic, the Frenchman Philippe Jaroussky, the Argentine Franco Fagioli, Romanian Valer Barna-Sabadus and Yuriy Mynenko from the Ukraine. The sole tenor in the recording is the German Daniel Behle.<br /><br />In addition to the beauties of the music both for orchestra and for singers that this fascinating work offers is the opportunity to hear the various comparisons of the differences in the qualities of vocal production of these five countertenors.  Each voice in unique with some more florid in the upper range and others more dramatic in the lower - alto - range. In the end each of these gifted men is able to create a wholly credible character while at the same time offering some of the most thrilling examples of the gift of countertenor vocal production.  This is a dazzling success of a recording! Grady Harp, October 12

1455527475|4.0|The book almost could be titled, \\"Why I Left Government.\\" It's about a career in big finance. After years working with elite financial professionals, Greg Smith's values came in conflict with the business. Customers and the public get disrespected because we're often gullible when it comes to financial instruments.<br /><br />Goldman Sachs (GS) had a storied and honorable tradition. Things changed during Smith's 12-year tenure. GS's corporate culture now reflects the corruption and cynicism of our society, only on a scale defying imagination.<br /><br />Be warned that the author, in my view, is not a natural storyteller. It's easier to stay with a story when the characters are brought to life.  My review is based on the audible version which is unabridged and narrated by the author.  I always appreciate it when the author is the narrator.  Smith's personal style is that he doesn't speak with a lot of passion.<br /><br />Smith started as a competitive academic high-performer when he was 21-years old in 2000. He describes the selection process as if coaching college students to make the cut with big-name firms. Candidates get subjected to extreme pressure and embarrassment. Smith later learned GS did this to assess candidates for integrity, as it's tempting to make stuff up under pressure in an effort to save face. Despite the state of the stock market at the time with the dot-com crash under way, those were idealistic and innocent times compared to now. In some respects, Smith's book is sincerely flattering to GS.<br /><br />I feel that Smith's turning point came when his best friend Lex asked one simple question. Lex was concerned about Congress passing TARP and bailing out Goldman Sachs along with other elite firms. Lex asked, \\"What about the other people whose 401Ks are getting decimated. Where's their bailout?\\" This question planted the seed. Smith began to understand that big winnings at GS were due to its quasi-government status and not delivery of superior service to clients.<br /><br />The former Goldman Sachs chief lobbyist, Mark Patterson had been brought in as chief of staff to Timothy Geithner at Treasury. GS's link to the welfare of its clients was gone. GS was in the DC power structure so realities on the ground had quietly shifted. Taxpayers made good dollar-for-dollar the enormous AIG bailout that went mainly to GS. The public would simply have to wait down the line for some kind of bailout, if it ever comes. And if it comes, John Q. Citizen might not immediately recognize it because trust was wiped out. That's what Smith seems to be trying to repair.<br /><br />Smith's depiction of GS tracks with the Wall Street culture famously described in Liar's Poker, by Michael Lewis. Entry into the culture of Goldman was exactly like entry into Salomon Brothers per Lewis. Young candidates were treated almost as dismissively as military recruits in boot camp/basic training. You're ready to graduate from the training when you can verbally stand up to your tormentors without violating the culture rules. I was fascinated.<br /><br />Smith's account lends support to some extent to Robert Kiyosaki's assertions that GS runs the government. Kiyosaki is author of Rich Dad Poor Dad. I got the impression that GS can get the rules changed in its favor. Clearly Smith's book gives GS partners something to worry about though. No client likes to be taken for a sucker. GS once had a stellar reputation, seems so long ago.<br /><br />(Recommended reading: [[ASIN:0615535453 Declare Independence from Party Affiliation]])vice to clients.<br /><br />The former Goldman Sachs chief lobbyist, Mark Patterson had been brought in as chief of staff to Timothy Geithner at Treasury.

If your a fan of Temple Run or Temple Run Brave, then you will enjoy Rayman Jungle Run too.  The graphics are really good and the price is totally reasonable especially considering the hours of entertainment you will get from playing it. I give it a 3 thumps up!! Amazon keeps the great games coming.
0385536828|5.0|Despite being a regular Ian McEwan reader since the first few pages of \\"A Child In Time\\" - the supermarket scene that still sticks with me, since  \\"Saturday\\" - which I found excellent -  I have been somewhat put off by his choice of topics and characters and what seemed to be an increasingly analytical point of view that to my mind verged on disinterest. I found \\"On Chesil Beach\\" to be an excruciatingly detailed, if not sadistic, account of a 12 hour embarrassment. Reading the preview of \\"Solar\\" in the New Yorker I  immediately disliked the main character - if I remember - an overweight self satisfied academic - and felt the same about the female lead for \\"Sweet Tooth\\" when it was previewed as a short story in the New Yorker earlier this year. Having the opportunity to get \\"Sweet Tooth\\" through the Vine Program, I had nothing to loose and I am glad I got this book. The excerpt in the New Yorker did not do the narrative justice. I greatly enjoyed this book being immediately engulfed by Mr McEwan's prose and his ability to recreate the early 1970s in London, the IRA bombings, the miner's strike and the power cuts that at one point stood between me and graduation. The story and its telling does not strike a single discordant note unlike the most recent books of several of Mr McEwan's contemporaries. Having enjoyed \\"Sweet Tooth\\", I immediately ordered \\"Solar\\" and from this experience will no long preview new books through excerpts in the New Yorker.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|Awesome! We just ordered Season 2! We need to catch up so we can watch Season 3 on HBO!<br />Great series!!
B007THA4FI|2.0|This is a grim story about the lives of people that hold little or no interest to anyone.  The book needed magic, not the magic in the Harry Potter series, but the magic that brings a story into the hearts of it's readers.  This books is about the pettiness of people, the useless efforts of others fill the space left by the death of a irreplaceable person, and the shameful way this person is remembered in the lives of the heartless people in his community.  What a waste of time to read, and a waste of talent of the writer.

I am very tech savy and could not get this thing to work, I even called the company- they were no help, just told me to return it. So I returned it to amazon for another one (the company told me I just had a \\"bad\\"one). Same exact thing happened with the second one- it was such a huge pain. Lots of time and money lost. Amazon charged a restocking fee- terrible.<br />I usually don't write reviews- but this really is a bad product.

B004JVZXXU|1.0|This movie is about absolutely nothing. It's a \\"horror\\" film that is majorly watching a well to do family live their every day lives being happy and well to do that is... until dunn dunn dunn. Doors start to shut by themselves, a pot magically falls off a rack, uh oh! did someone leave the stove on? Woa! did that girl just get locked outside the house. Run! It's a shadow following you! I seriously don't understand how this movie ever made it big. To a horror fan this entire series is an insult boring, not fun, and is like one long Home Depot commercial. \\"Do your doors squeak? Problems with your stove? Need a place to hang your pots? Well come on down to Home Depot! we have all your house repair needs!\\" I mean I'm getting upset just thinking about the hour and something I wasted watching these boring people talk about their boring lives while they got scared from bumps and thumps in the night. Not to mention all the characters were annoying! Except for the Dog. He was the best actor. I hope he moves on to do better work in his Career. Maybe a Rin Tin Tin remake.<br /><br />There is nothing and I mean nothing in this film worth watching at all. It's not scary, it's not suspenseful, it's just plain boring. There is no story, there is nothing of interests. This movie was strictly made to just make money off the hype from the first film. Usually in a film this bad you root for the ghost to get the characters but even that is a let down. I keep wondering why do these films exists? How is it that they become successful? Why would someone pay to watch this? You could pick the worst film ( and there are a lot of them) in the the Afterdark Horror Fest series and it would look like your watching a block buster like Avatar compared to this crap. This film is so bad it makes you appreciate other films that are actually bad. I feel compelled to go back and give all the low ratings I gave some horror films 5stars after watching this. This films has no purpose and no point and ZERO effort put into it. It's like being a fly on the wall in the house of a boring spoiled rich family. With a pool and a Jacuzzi and a foreign nanny. To think 2 more films exists after this. I'm glad I will only make it this far. I fast forwarded my way through the first one I didn't find tables moving by themselves scary.<br /><br />0/5 forget that I even gave it 1 star.effort put into it.

B002VKE1K2|1.0|I watched this film with my hand Fast forwarding every 5minutes. I get this is a low budget film but it's not scary at all. It's amateurish even for an amateur and nothing ever happens really until the end. Then when it does it's like \\"oh, okay\\" whatever. I just can't grasps the idea that a movie with basically no real story or suspense has blown up this big. I'm guessing the people giving this 5stars and calling it scary are \\"reality TV\\" fans that just like spying in and watching other peoples lives. That is all you do in this film watch these people live their boring day to day lives then wow a table moves, something falls, look she's floating Wow. If anything I give this movie the credit of having the best marketing campaign and profit probably in the history of movie making. It costs nothing to make almost and it cashed in big. This movie basically sold itself on being hype especially when the found footage stories died out with the Blair Witch which was also another long and boring film of watching people run around with the shaky cam and snot and tears dripping from their noses for 120mins. What's scary about a movie in which the worst thing the \\"demon\\" does is knock a pot off the shelf or slam a door shut. How is that scary? This films is about maybe 10-20minutes worth of actual horror worthy footage stretched out and watered down into a 110minute film. How anyone can like this I'll never understand. Being a master horror movie fan and having seen so many different horror movies foreign and domestic I'm just shaking my head at this entire series. They honestly don't even try. The first one has the excuse of a small budget but the later ones...smh. I can honestly barely write a review for this movie describing it because there's nothing to talk about. 2 people live in an apartment and talk and talk and talk about their boring problems. They set up camera's to tape said boring problems, One of the Camera's fall over, you get a closeup of a blurry face, and then the movie ends. This is garbage.the movie ends. This is garbage.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|The \\"Wool Omnibus Edition (Wool 1-5)\\" starts out with a short story (Book One) which is excellent and reminded me very much of the kind of story Bradbury would tell.  It introduces a few characters who we see evolving through the rest of the series.  Some come and some go.  There is an excellent hook at the end and it really motivates you to dive into the rest of the series.  The subsequent four books are longer than the first and they proceed to flesh out the unusual world the story revolves around.  The really interesting thing about the books is so many aspects of the world these characters live in are tantalizingly mentioned in the first short story.  As a reader, you are really eager to see the machinations behind what happens in this very first part of the book.  The rest of the series delivers with interesting characters, both good and evil, cut-throat politics and heroic adventures.<br /><br />Being an \\"Omnibus Edition,\\" implies a group of separate stories put together in a collection, but this is slightly misleading as the stories read very much like one long novel.  I would not put this work in the \\"classic sci-fi\\" category as some reviewers appear to be doing.  It is a very enjoyable, fairly quick read, with lots of twists and turns and some clever ideas for less than the cost of a regular paperback.

B00984668E|5.0|I just recieved The Sword-Apocryphon from Amazon. This is the fourth album from the austin heavy metal rockers. I am listening to it as i write this. I have the other 3 cd's and love them all. The band is a throwback to the 70's when metal was in a state of evolution (if you will),to what it has become today. They remind me of Black Sabbath with Ozzy's original vocal style. But, that being said they are also very original in their own way. I am enjoying this album immensley!They play the old style but with original integrity. If you enjoy high quality metal, that just flat rocks, and has integrity,this band is for you!I also highly recommend the other 3 albums. All excellent metal music with a high level of quality of musicianship and they flat out rock as well!Don't miss this one, it's a must buy!

B002BAWIWU|5.0|This is a fabulous collection of George's work.  It didn't have everything I wanted all in one place - there's no accounting for people's taste!  I love \\"Apple Scruffs\\" and \\"Don't Make Me Wait Too Long\\" and would have loved if they were on this compilation.  I don't think either of those songs would make their way onto a \\"Best Of\\" collection either but I totally think they are a couple of his best efforts.  Being a huge George Harrison fan I must confess I enjoy all of his music; I just love some tunes more than others. \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" is a Harrison classic but I wouldn't want to listen to it all day long.  \\"Apple Scruffs\\", on the other hand, makes me want to dance so I can play that over and over and over again and never tire of it.  One makes me want to dance, the other makes me think.  I guess I'd rather dance right now.... Like everything in life, one's opinion is just that:  one person's opinion at a point in time.  Not necessarily right or wrong, just a point of view.  And overall, I love George's POV and his unique sound.  So, of course, I love this collection!  That's what it is; a collection of his music.  I don't know that \\"George Harrison:  Songs That Make You Want To Dance\\" is in the works yet.  That is probably a CD I'll have to compile for myself!

B001ASVXSE|5.0|Sound on reissues can be a spotty thing.  I did some comparisons of two of the recordings in this box with their original LP issues just for fun, with surprising (to me) reults.<br /><br />First, I should confess that I have been bitten by the \\"audiophile\\" bug, and, further, have acquired a taste for good LP's over CD's in many cases.  Really good LP's sound, well, really good.  EMI has, over the years, made a number of LP's that remain much admired in the audiophile world.  And this includes some of their earlier mono LP's.  One of those mono LP's is the Taneyev Suite de Concert (featured on CD 14 of this box).  I got hold of several copies of the original UK pressing of the Taneyev LP (not that hard to do, actually), cleaned them up, chose the best one of the lot, and compared it to the remastering of CD 14.  I expected the LP to sound better (as they often do, especially good ones like the early EMI's).  The LP comes from the good old vacuum tube days, and sounds very warm and musically rich.  But so does the CD.  In fact, after comparing the two, I'd have to say that I would just as soon listen to the CD.  For one thing, I don't have to turn it over, and for another, it doesn't have pops and tics in it, as did even the best of the 3 or 4 copies of the 50+ year old LP did.  (By the way, the notes to the Oistrach box seem to be pretty vague about which recordings are mono and which are stereo.  I confirmed that the Taneyev was only released in mono via the Rees Mono Record Collector's Handbook.) (Yes, folks, if you've got one of the Rees mono records guides, you know you've got the bug, bad!)<br /><br />The next comparison I did was with one of my record buddies, who had a copy of the early EMI \\"SAX\\" pressing of the Schubert Piano Trio No. 1 -- another really swell piece, by the way, and stereo this time (and, yes, if you know what an EMI \\"SAX\\" pressing is...well, let me just say that it has been suggested to me that I get out and circulate around a bit more...andnot around more record collectors...!).  We compared the SAX pressing with same piece on CD 16 of the box set, and, again to our surprise, concluded that we would just as soon listen to the CD.  Now, the SAX LP pressing was not in fabulous shape -- it's an expensive one -- and MAYBE we would have come to a different conclusion if we'd had a superb copy, but, for myself, I am just as happy to have a really good CD remastering today for whatever small cost it is than to wait around and spend a bunch of money for a 50-year old LP that at best would provide only a modicum of additional musical enjoyment -- if any.<br /><br />Those are the only direct comparisons that I did, although I have listened with great pleasure to various of the other CD's in this box.  It's an incredible bargain, with really seriously good sound, and I would highly recommend that anyone with an interest in great performers of the 20th Century to pick it up pronto, before it disappears (as these boxes have a distressing tendency to do).
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game. Entertaining and so like the casino game except I am not feeding it real money. When I use up my coins I just wait awhile and more appear.  It is fun to sell my prizes for more coins.<br />You can't go wrong with this game.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this book. I was looking for a new series after reading 50 shades and decided to read this one. It was amazing I finished both books in 2 days. It's similar to fifty shades but still different enough that I didn't think about fifty. Def excited to buy the third book
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This follow up of Bared to You is even better than the first! I love that the characters keep evolving and we learn more about Gideon and his past without revealing too much. It certainly kept me on my toes and was a very emotional read.<br /><br />Can't wait for book 3!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|fantastic app. never have a problem with it. it works efficiently and is convenient to check the battery. thank you!!!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|First, it's a good read, and every business owner or wanna be owner should read it. With that said, the biggest problem I have with it is some may see Jobs and the way he ran his business as an appropriate model for mangers and owners to follow.  His reality distortion field was what helped him succeed, not his a-hole personality....but, come to think about it, maybe the two are not mutually exclusive...
B008XG1X18|5.0|What a great way to remember the best ideas! I would definitely recommend this app. It has become one of my favorites by far!

B000E6UK5K|4.0|When I first heard this I thought it was very boring and very bad.  After several listens however, I now consider it a very good album (still a little boring at the end) and well worth the purchase.  Recommended after getting About Face.  His first solo album is not very good.

0440244412|5.0|I would definitely recommend this series to everyone... I thoroughly enjoyed it and am so glad that I have all 5 books. If you would like a book that will hold your attention and not let it go, then you should read it. This particular book is book 5 of the series.

B0045D3N3O|5.0|Excellent movie,  I purchased the blu-ray and was very pleased. I saw the movie many years ago in the theatre, but this experience was just like viewing it for the first time. The colors are vibrant and you get the feeling that you are part of the movie.<br /><br />The DVD comes in a book like package so it is really a collectors edition.  If you don't have this movie for your collection, I highly recommend that you order this one ASAP!!!!

0545123275|5.0|This book was a breath of fresh air after a long period of drowning in shockingly bad YA novels. I'd all but given up on the genre before picking up Shiver. Intelligent and aloof Grace regularly observes the pack of wolves that live in the forest surrounding her home. No one else can understand the deep connection she feels with the wild animals, especially one in particular, the young wolf with the yellow eyes. The story crosses between Grace and Sam, the yellow eyed wolf, with his human like thoughts revealing his true identity and his desperate struggle. This book is not about werewolves. This essentially is a love story, with a delightful supernatural twist. Pure magic.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia Day brings such passion to her characters. I loved Bared to you as well. I can't wait for another book. She takes the reader into the raw emotions of the characters. Well Done!
0545123291|5.0|In Shiver, Grace and Sam found happiness but not the race is on to keep that happiness alive. It's Graces turn to struggle against the dark force pulling her away from Sam and her life. This book is written beautifully, and the many quotes and poetry drizzled through like strings of honey are pure pleasure. This book is for true word lovers. My new favourite character by a mile is Cole. Dark and brooding, Cole is an unapologetic ex-drug addict rock star who swaggers into the story and into Isabelle's life. I often listen to music while reading, as I feel it adds to the mood of the story. The ending deserved the big guns. I listened to Turn Up The Bright Lights by Interpol for the closing chapters and felt myself transported into the story. It was dark and intense and breath-taking and beautiful. One of the best endings I've ever read.
B00354YA2M|1.0|Bills writing isn't in dispute. But he does miss the magic of Australians. In reading this I was both offended and bewildered, wondering what country is he in?  Sadly this is such a two-dimensional view on Australia that it grieves me to read it as an Australian. I'm saddened this is what an outsider thinks of my country.
B006JD48NM|5.0|I am a gear head and have been involved as a corner marshall for over 30 years. I have worked F-1 races in the US when Senna competed and never really liked him as a competitor.

B002BI6SMI|5.0|We went and saw Taken 2 the following week! This movie always has you on the edge of your seat.
B006RED4GA|4.0|I screened this film the other day and was totally surprised.  Pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />This movie is very funny and quirky, especially at the beginning.  As the film progresses it becomes more terrifying, but the director did a very good job of taking his time and building the suspense.  While watching, I actually started thinking about the whole \\"found footage\\" (FF) genre, if that is a genre.  Now, this is surely not of that genre, thank god.  I have to admit, if I see another FF movie I am going to, well, scream.  Not scream from fear but scream from boredom and pain.<br /><br />Probably the reason I thought of the whole FF genre:  the two main characters here - a guy and a gal who have temporarily taken over running a hotel just before it closes - have their own video cameras and equipment, and are trying to record evidence of a ghost in the hotel.  Now, Sara Paxton is very good here and very funny; and Pat Healy is excellent as well.  Even Kelly McGillis gives a nice performance as a, well, psychic, I guess.<br /><br />I guess the critics really liked this film but the average viewer did not.  I think that I know why.  This film plays it straight; it doesn't rely on some lame twisteroo at the end.  I liked that alot.  If you are a twisteroo fan - there are many of those out there and twist away - you probably won't like this film.  But for me, this was a very refreshing idea:  no twisteroos!  Whoda thunk it?<br /><br />A surprisingly big recommendation here.
B005GSY23M|4.0|Not bad at all. The ambient sounds from the movie are soothing and interesting but the tracks from the other artist bring back memorable moments in the movie.

B004LOMB2Q|3.0|Needed a notetaking app for school that would work across my Kindle, my MacBook, and iPhone. This syncs with an account, and is easy to use for the most part.<br />Trouble on the Kindle Fire: difficult to edit notes, too many steps and slow to see if it edited the text properly. Plus, copying text from my class's PDFs takes forever: have to constantly fix the text font and size and remove hard line breaks. Seems to have trouble with various kinds of formatting.<br />Works ok on the Mac except for the fixing of text fonts, sizes and breaks.<br />Awaiting results on the iPhone.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I bought the book on a Sunday morning expecting to have a long, drawled out 2 weeks with it. It has been just 10 hours and I have devoured this book. Reflected in You gives you more of an insight into Gideon Cross that Bared to You failed to communicate. The relationships in this book are as raw as the issues that sometimes hit the back burner in popular literature. The love these two characters share should be the love we all deserve to have, the ever consuming, obsessive, relentless need for another person that doesn't match our own need for self preservation. I cried, laughed and became angry with the characters and to me that is a great read because in those ten hours I felt they were real feelings. That's what makes a great author, the ability to make the audience truly feel.

B008MPQ0R2|5.0|The Criterion Collection has given Wong's film a simply amazing Blu-Ray upgrade. For a film that has such striking imagery, this new transfer really shows them off. In the Mood for Love has never looked better. The sound is also top notch with atmospheric effects spread out and the music coming across crisp and clear.<br /><br />There are two new extras with this Blu-Ray edition but sadly the interactive essay by film scholar Gina Marchetti is gone, as is the photo gallery, key cast and crew biographies. In the liner notes, we no longer have the essays film critic Li Cheuk-to and the director's statement. Completists may want to old on to the previous Criterion DVD - [[ASIN:B00003CXUM In the Mood for Love (The Criterion Collection)]].<br /><br />\\"@ In the Mood for Love\\" is a 51-minute making of documentary that traces the film's origins to actual filming and how Wong made changes to the story as he went along. He says this film exists in the same world as his second film, [[ASIN:B0002X7GWU Days of Being Wild]], also set in the `60s. Tony Leung claims that early on the film was more erotic in nature but somewhere along the way changed to be more subtle.<br /><br />There are four deleted scenes with optional commentary by Wong. He provides a bit of backstory to the footage and shares filming anecdotes. One scene revisits the characters 10 years later and we see how much they've changed in that time.<br /><br />\\"Hua yang de nian hau\\" is a montage of images from Chinese cinema set to Zhou Yuan's song of the same name. Wong uses archival footage to celebrate his country's rich cinematic history.<br /><br />There is an interview with Wong Kar-Wai and he talks about the challenge of getting his film made during an economic crisis in Hong Kong. He speaks of his fondness for the time period depicted in the film. He also speaks eloquently about the characters and his approach to them while also briefly talking about how he directed Cheung and Leung's performances.<br /><br />\\"Cinema Lessons\\" features an interview with Wong at the Cannes Film Festival. He talks about his love of principal photography, which, for him, is like a vacation - hence his infamously long shoots.<br /><br />Also included is the press conference at the Toronto International Film Festival with Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung. They talk about working with Wong and how he never has a complete screenplay and likes to improvise while filming. They speak of the challenges they faced making it and how it made for a sometimes frustrating experience.<br /><br />New to this edition is \\"On In the Mood for Love,\\" which features an interview with film critic Tony Rayns. He puts the film in the context of Wong's career and how personal a work it is to the director. Rayns points out that Wong drew on his experiences of growing up in Hong Kong during the `60s.<br /><br />The other new extra is \\"The Soundtrack,\\" which features Rayns talking about the film's richly evocative soundtrack. Wong chose a mix of pop songs, Nat King Cole, waltzes and original instrumental music. You can also listen to 12 tracks from the soundtrack.<br /><br />Finally, there are television spots from Hong Kong, the United States and France as well as trailers from these three countries.\\"Cinema Lessons\\" features an interview with Wong at the Cannes Film Festival.

0316228532|2.0|I did read all of the Potter series and loved the books.  However, I was looking forward to reading a book by Rowling about adult issues and with adult themes.  This was a terrible disappointment.  She has a real skill in bringing characters to life, by why would one want to have these horrible, depressing people brought to life?  There was none of the humor to be found anywhere that saved the Potter books from being unrelentingly dark, especially toward the end of the series.  I was left depressed and unsatisfied.  I heard her say in an interview that it ends on a hopeful note, but even that's hard to find.  All in all, a real downer.

Not funny for the kids, 5,7 and 10, and not interesting enough to keep Mom and Dad's attention. Love Burton, but this was not good. We may not be quite EMO enough to get this movie...But we gave it a good try.

086571701X|5.0|This book is the most thorough book I've found about aquaponics.  Most of the others have been mainly hydroponics with a little aside for the aquaponic system.  But this begins with an overview of aquaponic systems including the different types of media, fish, plants and types of system setups.  It then walks you through what is necessary to have your own healthy system of any size, in any location.  It did grow a little dry while presenting the detailed scientific information on what is necessary to keep a system healthy and in balance, but that is to be expected for that kind of information.  The fact that it actually goes into that kind of detail is wonderful and extremely useful.<br /><br />Bottom line: Currently this is THE book if you are SERIOUSLY interested in setting up your own aquaponic system.  If you are just looking for a general overview of what aquaponics is, then do an internet search instead of buying a book.

A much better deal in my opinion (sadly I now own both! Though I bought the mp3 of this album for $10, so I'm only out that much in the end!)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000076GYI Prokofiev: Complete Concertos]]  (Was $21.64 at time of writing)<br /><br />It seems that Ashkenazy is one of those soloists that create a rift between many classical music lovers.  He has been criticized for being 'too stiff' or for playing 'too technically'.  With some of the older classical pieces, I agree.  But with the 20th century (and late 19th) Russian composers, Ashkenazy seemed to find his passion.  I own several recordings of Ashkenazy performing Rachmaninoff and Shostakovich, and his performances are wonderful.  This collection of the wonderful Prokofiev piano concertos is among the best of his recordings and is one of the better Prokofiev piano recordings I have heard.  For the record, I also enjoy the Argerich version with #1 & #3 and Bartok: [[ASIN:B00000C2J8 Prokofiev: Piano Concertos Nos. 1 & 3 / Bartok: Piano Concerto No. 3]].  But the real gem in this set is the #2 concerto.<br /><br />Ashkenazy is still a little... formal? shall we say?  His playing has never really been too interpretive or too romantic, but in these concertos, I think that the fun is in the play of the intensity vs restraint and the work with the pedals on the piano.  Ashkenazy has always had that wonderful style of playing to the intensity of the piece and then backing off when appropriate.  It's not too romantic, but it's quite stunning to listen to.  I found this style of particular interest on his Chopin collections.<br /><br />Andre Previn has always been one of my favorite conductors and he leads the London SO so well on this recording.  The orchestra rarely tries to drown out Ashkenazy, and when Ashkenazy needs to come in or fade out, the timing is impeccable.<br /><br />The real treat is that this can be purchased as an mp3 for $10.  That's just crazy.  People will always have their own personal preferences for classical music.  I am a fan of Ashkenazy; always have been, always will; but I would not say he is the best or that this is the best version of these concertos.  But I believe that any discussion about the better recordings of these concertos should involve this recording.  And the recording itself is very high quality, and the digital transfer was flawless.  Bravo Decca on another fine re-release.nductors and he leads the London SO so well on this recording.

B005K17RU0|5.0|It worked correctly from the first on my Original Kindle Fire (2011). I tried each button @ the bottom of the screen and quickly got a correct response. If you are having trouble on your Fire try COMPLETELY shutting Fire down then restart. Now I do not have to go to a site for my local weather!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I wish I could give it more than 5 stars I absolutely love this game! I only hope they come out with more gadgets even though this one takes long time which is great
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I wanted more detail about the status of the battery charge, and this app does exactly that. It has the extra advantage that it hits the \\"sweet spot\\" of providing sufficient detail without overwhelming me with data which might only interest an electrical engineer. I appreciate such design.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This app has all the functions a basic office User needs. If you are more advanced you can have a good use to but it is close to the bare minimum for features. Overall this app is a great substitute for Microsoft Word and Powerpoint and excel are good too. OfficeSuite works great for the kindle fire. It also features the ability to print directly from the app. To do this you will first need to install HP's EPrint app.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|After seeing all the heroes films I was excited to see this.  In comic fashion they story unfolds amidst a ego adjustment for all.  Good fun!
B008AU7F3C|5.0|Two weeks of listening to it, and I am completely in love with this album. While not as immediately captivating as Two Suns was, it takes a few listens to reveals it's beauty, but believe me when I say it'll get under your skin and it'll stay with you. Don't judge it on just one listen! It's more intimate then the last two records (which I cannot recommend enough, if you like The Haunted Man), but it also feels more mainstream to me, more accessible? Without losing that Bat For Lashes charm. Easily one of the best albums of 2012. Favorite tracks are Lilies, Marilyn, The Haunted Man and Laura.
B000FC1LOC|4.0|While I always find Jodi Picoult's writing to be thought provoking and wonderfully dramatic, I found myself not happy with the way this book ended.  I love how she delves into the feelings of all involved and didn't just write it from one main perspective.  Was a great read and overall I'd recommend it to someone who wants a book that is fiction but makes you think nonetheless....<br /><br />Hope this review helped.
B007JOM0GC|5.0|Glad to have purchased this mp3 album.. I've listened to it several times and the best part is that because it's not a cd, I don't have to worry about wearing it out.
B007PFD90G|1.0|Publicized as Rushdie's account of his life during the time of the Ayatollah's fatwah, this was a lame description of what he was thinking and feeling during the ten years he was being protected by Scotland Yard.  He mentions names and places but doesn't really get at the heart of the fear and confusion he must have felt.  At then end of this short book, one is left wondering, \\"What was he thinking?\\"  Frankly, save your money.

B00846REIS|3.0|A good read, but not as good as the Shades Of Grey books......it does not make you want to read the others in the series as the \\"Grey\\" books did.
0446547646|2.0|Mr. Sparks is capable of putting a story together and even writing a few good sentences.  However, this book is weak from beginning to end. The characters are two-dimensional. The entire book just feels contrived.  The few \\"surprises\\" are easily predictable.  I decided to finish this potboiler but I couldn't wait to get it over with.  His attempts at wisdom and the supernatural show no insights. I will never read another of his books.
1612183956|5.0|This is the first time I've been moved to write an actual review of a book on Amazon. Wow. I just finished this story a few minutes ago and I'm still breathless. In some ways the first part of the story reminds me of the video game \\"Alan Wake\\" but after ripping through this book in a few hours I think it's even better. The twist at the end nearly had me white-knuckling my Kindle. I will definitely be checking out Crouch's other books! Absolutely thrilling story!
B007V65R54|5.0|Great book in new understandings of science and prediction and a fun read taking in baseball, the recession and the weather he lays out the paradigm of probability in a very clear way.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The Avengers is one of those movies many people will want to watch multiple times.  While it helps with back story to have seen at least some of the Marvel superhero movies about the individual character that are brought together to form the disfunctional team known as The Avengers, it isn't necessary.  When I saw this in the theater, many scenes had the entire audience laughing out loud.  Really good show.

I haven't watched a lawyer show since The Practice, so for whatever that's worth!  Gabriel Macht is the classic jerk lawyer with a heart of gold, and he's so charming you can't hold it against him.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|kinda cool. this is the first touch screen rpg I've ever played.  I've played diablo, doom, duke nukem , wolfenstein, I like the first person shooters too but this one is pretty good too. I'm still working my way through the levels but I can already see myself spending hours playing this.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was great.  This book was even better than the first one. The love story of Gideon and Ava is spectacular and that fact that we really get to know these two characters and the trials and tribulations that they have endured in life.  They both have been through a lot and it's great to see how the benefit from one another.  I can't wait for the next book to come out....I really didn't want it to end and now I have to wait until Dec. to find out what happens to my favorite couple.

B00005AREQ|3.0|I'm a Jeff Beck fan, so maybe my expectations were too high. But it very much has a Kenny G vibe to it, and that's not a good thing. This fusion of jazz and rock is mostly just mush, I'm afraid. Also, I don't understand the mix or the production (by George Martin, no less, in this re-release). It's too lush, too soft, too suppressed, too pretty, anything, really, but not very strong. While Beck is not an all-out rocker, he is strong. But not here. Maybe this was revolutionary in 1975, but I guess it's not 1975 anymore.
B0006HBZXS|5.0|HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE BEFORE AND IT WAS GREAT. VERY SUSPENSEFUL. HOWEVER THIS DVD WILL NOT WORK ON MY DVD PLAYER. MESSAGE ON TV SAYS REGION UNDEFINED WHAT EVER THAT MEANS. VERY DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THAT.
0316228532|1.0|I was quite disappointed in JK Rowlings \\"adult\\" book.  It seems her only ideas of what makes a book \\"adult\\" literature is to frequently use \\"adult\\" (crass, needless profanity) words at any opportunity and making sure every character is an unlikable, deeply flawed person. This was a book that didn't hold my interest and was hard to finish.  There was no plot to hold the reader's interest which is so unlike her prior writing.  Nothing moved this story along and I felt I was was just plowing through it.  It was both simply bad and boring, a sad combination.  Reading should be for pleasure or entertainement and this was neither for me.  Now I don't know what to do with the book; it's not worth saving and I don't want to inflict reading it on others.  This was a very disappointing book from an author with much more talent then she showed here.  Was she just trying to \\"stretch\\" herself into something she isn't?
B003IDMUWM|4.0|I don't normally write reviews, but this is one of the best book I have read. I couldn't put it down!

B007KDFWRG|3.0|I bought this on a gold box special, without having heard this duo. Mistake. It tuns out I'm not a Tedeschi Trucks fan. Having said that, if you already know you like Tedeschi Trucks, this is a nice recording. If I were a fan, I would not hesitate to buy the product. But if you don't know whether or not you like them, I would check them out on Utube or something before purchasing.
B000068FXX|4.0|Memorable tracks such as \\"Even in the Quietist Moments\\" and \\"Fool's Overture\\" are a delight to the ears.  I also recommend \\"Crime of the Century,\\" and \\"Crisis? What Crisis?\\"

B000001FXR|5.0|Though they'd been around for years before they made this album,Bob Marley & The Wailers had become extremely discontented with the nature of the Jamaican recording industry. Artists were basically paid minimum wage and encouraged,at the very least,to produce near constant output. With their association with Lee Scratch Perry and his Upsetters the Wailers began to not only go against this system of musical apartheid but a new type of music began to grow from this called reggae. By 1973 the band were signed to Chris Blackwell's Island Records and, even though they may not have realized it at the time,right off the bat the wound up recording what is still commonly acknowledged as being one of the defining recordings of reggae history.<br /><br />  Blending that now classic repetitive style of reggae guitar rhythms with plenty of wonderful electric pianos,shuffling percussion and tight vocal harmonies elements of American and English pop,soul and funk also played an enormous part in this. Of course the result is what could be described as an album of reggae standards from \\"Concrete Jungle\\" with it's complex marriage of rhythm and melody as well as \\"Kingy Reggae\\",\\"No More Trouble\\",\\"Slave Driver\\"  and \\"Midnight Ravers\\". Peter Tosh's two contributions \\"400 Years\\" and \\"Stop That Train\\" dig a bit deeper into the groove but still keep the melody of Marley's sound intact. The tempo goes into somewhat more of ska territory here with somewhat more lighthearted lyrics than the more spiritual Rastafarian themes of the rest of the album.<br /><br />  And of course there's \\"Stir It Up\\",with it's wah wah accents and well known hook.  The combination of guitars as well as Peter Tosh's accents on keyboards are part of what makes this album musically so successful. Because of reggae's distinctive rhythm,it's one of those genres that's all too easy to make boring if one doesn't have the talent to work within the genre correctly. These guys did because their music definitely came from somewhere. No only had they been first inspired by early American R&B and soul music but the funk era also had a tremendous impact on them as well. One could here that in this albums depiction of reggae as being a genre defined musically by a strong sense of melody,groove and a strong sense of social and spiritual conviction. That combined with the extraordinary songwriting are probably what contributed to the enduring spirit of this particular album.mewhere.

B000NY12CI|5.0|I read a lot. This was such a good book, I couldn't put it down!!! I had a quite full schedule when I bought the book, but I managed to squeeze it little snippets of reading, like while I was cooking, etc, those and a free afternoon got it done for me! It was very graphic about her childhood...I felt like crying at the things Ayaan had to endure. Although I don't always enjoy reading about things that make me cringe, I believe it is important to gain that knowledge about what goes on in other parts of the world, so we can make a difference to our poor sisters.<br />I am a Christian, very strong in my faith, this book made me so grateful to have the hope that belief in Jesus Christ gives. This book talks a lot about Islam, since she was raised that way, I found their beliefs very interesting...for one thing, they have the same ethics as conservative Christianity, but Islam's are ENFORCED, whereas the ethics of Christianity are obeyed because we have Christ in our hearts, and obedience is the result of conversion. That's the trouble with Islam...it hasn't the power to convert the heart, and the unconverted heart that boasts of being fully converted is the most dangerous thing possible.<br />I definitely recommend reading this book if you're not sure you want to or not. =)<br />Hope this helps. =)

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like the way this game starts out easy.  It must be so that you dont feel defeated right out of the box! There are a few levels to work thru before it gets really tough. I can always tell when my mind is tired...I just cant find my way on the board! You arent just connecting the matching dots you have to do it in a way that the entire board is 'traveled'. Its a great game for beginners and advanced players. Good but simple brain game.

B005LAIIRQ|5.0|It seems that many reviewers seem to need a happy ending, clear answer or their faith in God reinforced by what's presented to them by various producers and directors.<br />  I view many films, have read thousands of books and still find the approach of a clean wrap up or happy ending to often minimize an entire story.<br />  For many of us, life is a generic merry-go-round with few hazards to keep us up to speed with the idea that life, for all people, was once very brute-ish and, in fact, still is in some parts of the world.  One reviewer even discounts the film due to characters attempts to invoke God to assist them somehow but no miracles are on hand to provide for their rescue.<br />  This film took us on a bitter journey in which Liam Neeson's character travels a Homerian path where, in the end, though we do not see it and it's almost certain he didn't survive, he embraces the life he wanted to end so tragically uselessly in the beginning of the film and enters into a final, great battle that, to me, celebrates life and the refusal to go quietly into that dark night - to paraphrase a poem.<br />  The dramatic set ups - the wolves invading the crash site, Neeson's leadership taking his group in an unfortunate direction - are all part of  what film makers do to create their visions. If wrong choices weren't made or plot moments with holes in them were all left on cutting room floors, we'd all be sitting around playing poker all night instead of watching good, bad and ugly films. I don't make enough to play poker every night and I like getting my nose out of books once in awhile.<br />  Maybe it's not a 5 star film, but it entertained the crap out of me and, therefore, I gave it as much.<br />  Less over-analyzing and more sex!
B001URCM44|5.0|Even after all the years since this album first debuted, it is my all-time favorite Yanni album. I have it in every format now offered, from the LP vinyl, then cassette, CD and now to MP3 and on my iPod. Full of the energy of a live performance at one of the most famous venues in Greece, this is Yanni in his younger, most creative time. His music was (and still is) of a different breed, and was my first introduction to this most talented performer. The video that went with it, which still sometimes shows up on PBS, showcases his talent and that of his amazing orchestra/band, who only get better with time. From the opening notes till the closing melodious strains, this is true Yanni, the one the fans adore (and many critics do not). You either love Yanni's different style of music or you don't. Those of us who do enjoy it recognize his unique talent and will stand in line for tickets for hours to catch him live. He has done MANY more albums since this one, and I have them all, but this is the one I play when I want to put on headphones and just soak up all that talent and energy. When I was in college, this is what I would listen to as I studied, and I honestly think I passed a couple of stinker courses doing that! This is a \\"must have\\" if you are a true Yanni fan, although I would venture to say that if you are a true fan, you already have it.
B00006JDVV|5.0|The plot holes are huge and more annoying than a Maine back road by final spring thaw but this is one top-notch action flick. Someone in charge of doing the ad campaigns for 'John Carter of Mars' must have had a hand in getting this diamond in the rough buried. The effects are the best you'll find in a dragon/dino/creature flick - the acting terrific and pacing make this a movie worth frequent viewings. Once you move past the premise of the prehistoric ancestry and miraculous survival of dragons, as a species, and get into the grit of the film, it's nothing but tense, action filled fun.<br />  If you haven't seen it, you really don't know what you're missing.

B007MDB548|5.0|I've known of Tinker Bell since I was a little girl, mostly from movies such as Peter Pan, Hook, and seeing her flittering about the screen for many things Disney.  Until recently I never watched one of the Tinker Bell fairy movies though.  I had the opportunity to screen Secret of the Wings in 3D while I was in Los Angeles in August, and then rewatched it after receiving the Blu-ray/DVD combo pack to review.<br /><br />Secret of the Wings is the fourth Disney fairies movie and finally explores winter.  The first four movies each focus on a different season.  Winter is often tricky to animate due to the snow.  Of course, Disney does a fabulous job because they make sure to study nature and keep it as real as possible - from the falling snow to the plants used for their clothing.<br /><br />The biggest surprise in Secret of the Wings, besides the Winter Fairies and the Winter Woods, is learning that Tinker Bell has a sister named Periwinkle!  Neither of them knew about the other, so we get to join them as they become fast friends and catch up with each other.  This movie really shows some of the fun quirkiness you'll find between sisters and does well at forging an emotional connection.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are dangers to warm fairies crossing into the Winter Woods and vice versa.  It's so dangerous that there's even a rule forbidding fairies to cross which upsets the girls.  They don't wish to be separated any longer, but defying this rule causes trouble for the Autumn Woods and threatens life for all fairies.  It takes some serious team work to make everything right again.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie (especially in 3D).  The writing is excellent in evoking emotion - I teared up several times the first time I watched it.  And... I still teared up at least once when I watched it again with my daughter.<br /><br />One thing I will say is that this movie is not overly girly.  I know most people will think a fairy movie is for girls, but there are boy fairies in it as well.  I didn't find it to be something that only girls would want to watch - I think most little kids (regardless of being a boy or a girl) would enjoy watching the Secret of the Wings!<br /><br />This movie has lots of positive messages about family, friends, team work, and even parenting.  When you learn about the rule about not allowing the fairies to cross over, I think you'll see how that can apply to parenting decisions and rules.<br /><br />*I attended a press screening and also received a copy to review.boy fairies in it as well.

0425263908|2.0|I'm a silent reader, and in spite of the countless chic lit and non-fiction books I read, sadly, i just never bothered writing a review....until this one. i was hugely disappointed with this book, I decided I MUST spill my two cents worth!!<br /><br />I must admit that 50 shades was the 1st book I read in that genre- erotica. While the \\"BDSM\\" was entirely new to me. After finishing the trilogy... I wanted MORE. Needless to say, I was hooked!<br /><br />I searched for book reviews and blogs, and 'Bared To You' kept popping up on recommended lists to read after FSOG.<br />Picked up a copy, and Oh.My.Gosh! Its like reading FSOG, WITHOUT the emotional pull from thr characters. I can barely finish the book, i kept comparing the similarities with Christian and Ana. If You havent read FSOG, then 'Bared to You' is something you MAY find amusing, the sex scenes were hot and well written-- much to the author's credit.<br /><br />Otherwise, plot is very boring and I didnt feel any emotional connection from the characters...<br />Pls save your money....<br />If you're open to YA, Beautiful Disaster is definitely worth the read after FSOG

0062119044|1.0|This is easily the worst book I have ever read, and in my opinion, one of the worst books ever to be published.  The only reason I didn't put it down was because I couldn't believe it had actually been published.  I had to read the whole thing to believe it.  None of characters were complete or credible.  The premise was timely but that's about it.  The narrator is totally negative and appears to be a sociopath.  It's obvious the author has no psychological understanding of human nature.  Because Eva is the narrator, and we only hear her side of the story, we never know if she is telling the truth.  And I do not find her vocabulary (sprinkled with rarely used words) particularly intelligent, clever or amusing. Her tone is arrogant and self serving. What bothers me the most is that some readers will actually think the work is representative of the human race.  I find the novel insulting and nonsensical--not to mention appauling and disappointing.  And these are my positive comments.
1400095204|5.0|This novel was brilliantly written, warm and heartbreaking and true. Adiche captured a moment in history in a way that wanted me to learn more about it. Her characters were real, heroic, flawed, and perfectly drawn. I've never been to Nigeria, but she made me see it--the country, the people, the struggles, the triumphs.<br /><br />I read her book of stories That Thing Around Your Neck upon picking it up in the library, and rushed out for her other work. I just finished Purple Hibiscus, which was also a wonderful read, and I anxiously await every new word this wonderful writer produces.
1423140605|3.0|One thing about the Percy Jackson books and the Heros books I have loved is that I feel like I can really relate to the characters and there is always humor injected into the story.  While I enjoyed the latest installment in the series, I felt as though there was an impending sense of doom right from the begining and the story seemed a bit disjointed at parts.  The characters are older, and a bit less relateable to me and I am not sure why.  all in all  - definately a book I enjoyed, I was just left wanting more.
B008LZHA3G|1.0|\\"Tempest\\" proves that it is time for the legend to give up and protect his status as one of the great poets of the 20th century.  Tempest has mediocre lyrics, the sound and feel of a country rockabilly album, why does Dylan need to make such stuff?  And the voice--oh my goodness--the Budweiser frogs are more melodious.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I almost didn't read the second and third books based on a friend's comments but I am so glad I decided to judge for myself. This wrapped up the trilogy perfectly and brought the characters to a satisfying ending. It is hard when reading the later books to remember that is a possible future for our own children. I believe the author intended to warn us about becoming complacent with our leaders and refusing to take responsibility for our ignorance. The children had to shoulder a very heavy and horrible responsibility because of the excesses of the older people. I hear so many people say they are not planning to vote because their vote is not of consequence when it is that attitude that destroys the world and elects leaders who are more interested in serving the special interests rather than the good of their people. The Hunger Games trilogy is a tale of caution for us to pay attention to our leaders, use our public voices and franchise and treat the planet with love. (I hope this doesn't come off too gooey!)
B000O8OTNC|5.0|fast delivery,  good quality,<br /><br />nice unit to throw in a bug out bag.<br />fair value for price - not the \\"ultimate\\" knife sharpener but cool for the price<br />glad i got two.
B008N5UX9M|4.0|Its takes 2 or 3 times to like it as the CD is deeper the more you know it and Rocks harder the louder it's played.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I'm a fan of the show and spend a lot of time overseas where I can't watch in real time and where local TV is in a foreign language and/or isn't very good.  It's nice to have this series on hand whenever I want to \\"watch some TV.\\"
B007THA4FI|3.0|Although by the time thatI finished this book I could say that I enjoyed it.  It took a long time to grab my attention.  It was not a book I could not put down.
B009KHCT94|4.0|Okay, where else can you combine Nazis and science fiction, a tongue-in-cheek bash on Americans and their New World Order, throw in some space travel, add a little underlying philosophy of Charlie Chaplin and balance it all with some good old eugenic humor? Well Iron Sky is your virtual location for just all of these fun things; and much more.  The movie is populated with loveable Nazis, deceitful politicians, deadly lies, sexy marketers, and a secretary of state in leather.  What would US policy look like if we had Sarah Palin for President?  Iron Sky gives us a peek.  What happens when press analysts really do take an office in a position of power?  Watch and see.  How do you make a dead nationalist philosophy come alive again?  Really you have to watch and see; this is the brilliance of Iron Sky.<br /><br />I streamed this movie and watched it twice.  After the second view I realized there is rich humor going on both above and below the belt; it's like 2 movies.  Watch it if you are a science fiction buff, then watch it again for the humor and satire.  Or just watch it as an action comedy film, but be prepared to give Iron Sky some thought.  It's not all space shoot outs, good looking astronauts and pretty girls with leather wings commanding space ships.  Watch this movie to see the Nazis from the dark side of the moon, but stay for the humor and excellent satire.  Nazis aren't just for bashing around anymore.

0385344228|5.0|Through narrative and court transcripts, readers learn of Andy Barber's efforts to defend his 14 year old son, Jacob, who is charged with murdering a classmate.  Admiration for this father's concern for his child is gradually tempered when it becomes apparent that Andy is equally concerned about keeping unsavory information about his own parentage secret.<br /><br />As event after event unfolds, readers are faced with the harmful consequences of actions that on the surface seem fueled by love.

B0072OFM28|1.0|This product doesn't work on Australian DVD and Xbox players, very disappointed with this purchase, should not be sold products that are not going to work.
B0010T0JC4|5.0|I had to have all white shoes. I first bought an expensive pair of leather tennis shoes but I got the worst blister from them. Being diabetic I could not take that chance with my feet again. So I bought these. They fit perfect, no blisters. and they are comfortable to be on my feet all day in. I have not tried out the non slip luckily. I am very pleased with these shoes and I had no back pain in them as others complained of.
B008X7F3CM|5.0|I had the great pleasure to attend a concert by Daniil Trifonov last week in Cambridge at Longy Conservatory.  I could not resist going out and purchasing the CD.  It is an oldie but Daniil does the piece justice with new, inventive takes in unexpected places.  Is it a totally new piece to the ear?  No.  That is probably impossible with this concerto.  His youtube on several Chopin etudes are utterly mesmerizing.<br />This young man is a stunning pianist.  He has remarkable stage presence.  I strongly recommend the cd and I look forward to others he will issue.<br /><br />George
B008EQIEWS|5.0|Good movie, good 3D effects. Will look foward to new releases of this title in the future. The first movie in this series I own in regular Blu-Ray, but the 3D is much more enjoyable to watch.
B005BW0VI8|3.0|Some of the songs on this CD are really great - lively, exciting, dynamic.  Imelda has a great voice and excellent backing musicians.  but . . . some of the songs just don't have that git up and go to them.  A real mixed bag.  Enjoy the ones that you really like and pass by the rest.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was an excellent read!  I am not usually an end of days/doomsday reader but I could not resist trying a book that had been awarded 5 stars with over 2000 reviews...quite an accomplishment!<br />Mr Howey manages to build just enough tension, mystery and character development to make this an easy, engaging journey into the silo and  the what if.<br />This book is worth more than the $5.99 being charged.  Consider it a bargain sale and get your copy ASAP!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|love this game just wish there was more coins very addictive. would recommend. to all my friends I play all the time when I have coins built up
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app for Kindle. Very easy to use and everything loads quickly. Definitely don't hesitate to download it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh is the newest addition to my favorite authors.  Technically excellent writing, he also has a gift for character development and setting.  I'm eagerly looking forward to more!
B009KHDT0C|1.0|I wouldn't bother watching this movie it's a waste of time, nothing funny and full of perversion. I love Johnny Depp but this was a total let down.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This was a great read, not too complicated of a plot but it had a few surprises in the story and the ending left me impatient for the second book which I hope I can get for my Kindle soon!
B0063IH60K|4.0|just downloaded and i like it. works well and the action is good.  love the one tap to move cards.
B006KX3GXO|3.0|For a free app it's not bad.. works great with my kindle fire, I use it often but would like to see better backgrounds and frames.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Enjoyable. Good way to just pass time and even a level of skill involved. Even my grandkids like it!! Would recommend it to anyone.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I enjoy this silly little thing because it is reminiscent of my youth and playing in arcades that are practically nonexistent now. It has some fun little extras and doesn't require much skill or brain power so when I just want something to escape for a few minutes and then doze off, I play this.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia has done it again.  She did not disappoint.  Eva and Gideon's troubles still continue.  Eva has come a long way in dealing with her troubled past.  She knows what she needs to stay healthy and hope's Gideon will do the same, but you cannot force someone to help themselves.  He struggles with his past because of not facing or trusting anyone to help him face it.  They both hurt each other and find a way to be together in the end.  Eva and her mother have to face the past together in this book and I think it is for the better.  Eva is such a surprise to me, she is so strong when it comes to her past and what she needs to do to overcome it to be and stay healthy.  Her need for Gideon and his for her seems a little obsessive, but maybe that's the only way they know how to love.  The face huge obstacles but they overcome and keep fighting for each other.  Of course I like the love scenes but I am surprised how much I like Eva and her strength, I did not see that in the first book.  She cares for her family and friends and her support for Cary and he for her is one of the best friendships I read in a long time.  I await the next installment.  Great job Sylvia Day, keep it up!
0316227706|5.0|I have to say this book flat out rocks. I was lucky enough to actually meet Seth and he has such a passion for what he does. I think you will see it really comes through in his images in this book. The personalities of these dogs really shines through every single image.

B00846REIS|5.0|If you enjoyed fifty shades of grey perfect book for! enjoyed every part of it great love story behind it
B008JGSM6G|5.0|An easy game to play but it builds up to a pretty good challenge. Everything works smoothly, which is something I cannot always say about this kind of game. I like the visual display, too.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I found this book to be disjointed and hard to follow and the contents depressing.  I kept waiting for the story to come together and become more cohesive but it never happened.  The storylines of the characters were too long as the book switched back and forth to the characters.  I was disappoointed.
B009CPES4I|4.0|As a baby boomer it's really great to see more movies with \\"senior\\" stars and \\"senior\\" issues. I am contemplating retiring in three years and have considered living outside the US. This movie gave me insight on questions to ask and also let me know its important to involve yourself in the local culture and customs to get the fullest benefit of the experience. I recommended this movie to my 82 year old mother who loved it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|VERY INTOXICATING READ..I HAVE JUST STARTESD READING SYVIA DAY AND SHE IS THE \\"BOMB\\"!!  awsome..... IF YOU LIKED FIFTY SHADES YOU WILL ENJOY THIS READ ALSO!!!!!!!!!!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Once I started reading, I could not put it down.  Just upset that I have to wait so long for the third book.  If you loved fifty shades, then you will love this series also.  Wish she would have released all three together.
B0098VYKSA|1.0|It stop several times and was blurry, the audio was good when it played. Not sure who fault it was with the feed.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Haven't read a book this intriguing in a long time. Gillian had some great  intuition on how a man's mind works.
0439023521|5.0|I was a little apprehensive to purchase this book, since it seemed to be geared towards the younger reader. This was very entertaining and a fast read. I can't wait to get the second and third books!
B009CPJHY4|4.0|The streaming was so bad I never got to the end.<br />Good movie, but maybe rent from another source in order to see it.
B008G8SFGO|2.0|There are a few songs worth listening to:<br />* Hell or Hallelujah<br />* Eat your Heart Out<br />* Shout Mercy<br />* All for the Love of Rock and Roll<br /><br />And others are just so-so. Wall of Sound is really bad and The Devil in Me is their worst song since Murder in High Heels back during the Animalize days.<br /><br />The music is repetitive and uninspired and Paul's voice went from bad to shameful. Gone are the days when he was one of the best in the business.<br /><br />I don't regret buying it, but it could have been much better if they had outside help to write songs.<br /><br />This CD is for Kiss fans only. I doubt they will make any new fans with it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The book was great!I couldn't put it down. I am now very anxiously awaiting the third book. I can't wait!!!
B003Z9Q4WG|5.0|The quality of sound is amazing, you cant go wrong with this set.  I own most of the works in this set with other orchestras and labels, and by far this set exceds most of them (even though many are newer recordings).  This set should be the centerpiece of your collection.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it awesome why you people hating it so cool I love making houses and stuff. y'all hatres  are their fans
1781161313|5.0|i got this book due to an argument I was in about the pulse rifle.  Now i understand more about the movies and games.  It's not a great book for casual reading but it is very fun for facts.
B002RI9BI0|5.0|I did not think anything could match Birdsong but this did. So much so that I went on immediately to complete the trilogy. Some parts were not easy reading but throughout it was authentic and utterly compelling. These are books that will remain in the memory for ever while many others fade.
B008SVFX96|5.0|Love Richie! Love his work! Love how he's everytime setting the bar higher and higher.... This a great CD, not just for Bon Jovi Fans....

1451696191|3.0|After reading, I found out that this book often provokes controversy when it is assigned reading in classrooms....no surprise there!  In a way, I didn't want to continue reading because it's all kind of sad and shocking, but I also had to finish reading.  I wanted to know what happens.  These characters aren't people that I would have liked or wanted to hang around with in high school.<br />Charlie, to me, is an impossible high school freshman.  His personality and remarks would be appropriate for a seven year-old boy.  His observations about his sister's interactions with her boyfriend, about his friend's homosexuality, about his grandfather's personality, and about other situations seem childlike.  He says that he won't be doing drugs again, but he never makes a judgment on the actions of others either.  I often wanted someone to say - hey, that's wrong!  However, his \\"wallflower\\" viewpoint - not judging or participating - does offer a perspective on situations that helps me as a reader.  You wonder how you would react to the book's situations; you're just glad that you don't have to.  The author includes everything a teen might be faced with in high school: drugs, drinking, fooling around, abusive boyfriends, teen suicide, pregnancy, homosexuality, child abuse, etc...  Too Dr. Phil!<br />In the past though, I often haven't liked assigned books that were supposed to open up discussion about serious topics; so, maybe I'm not being fair or \\"smart\\" with my criticism.  The story is thought-provoking, and I did want to finish reading.<br /><br />*This book was received for review, this in no way affects my opinion*
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|UPDATE: I had originally given the product a much better rating but the cords stopped working in less than 60 days.<br /><br />Original: I haven't had it long enough to determine if it warrants 5 stars but like the title of my review 'so far so good'.  Considering that my original cord basically broke apart with little pieces of the casing landing unceremoniously everywhere I plugged it in I am happy for the all in one piece cord.
B009KHBDUU|3.0|Made for a nice movie night rental - a bit of fluff. Some nice laughs, especially early on when Depp first returns from the grave. Johhny Depp,as usual, transforms himself into another character worth watching.
1454701250|5.0|This book is an absolute delight from cover to cover. It's full of lots of useful information, tips, templates, project ideas and so much inspiration. The attention to detail in the book's design is just beautiful. I love Geninne's work (if you don't already follow her blog: [...] then start now!). I've done a bit of stamp carving before (inspired by Geninne's blog) but this book gives me so many new ideas for ways to use stamps. Highly recommended. Enjoy!
B004EBZX6W|5.0|. Works great on my phone , Even Better on my Kindle Fire. USed it at work to find Rogue Devices . works just as good as  $2000 devices for this purpose.
B008WCP2PG|1.0|My expectations for this film were that I could enjoy upbeat dance routines to the FULL VERSIONS of the late 70s music that I loved to hate growing up and that the quality of the film-making would demonstrate some of the talent that Steven Soderbergh showed in movies such as \\"Sex, Lies, and Videotapes\\" and \\"Pleasantville.\\"<br /><br />I also was not expecting epic scenes or a script that would have lines that I would be quoting years from now. As it is, I cannot recall a single line from it.<br /><br />What I got was very mundane aerobics that did not last an entire song and that were performed by completely vacant thoroughly bored zombies who were cast as strippers despite being unable to respectably fill out a G string. I love the Matt Bomer from \\"White Collar\\" and have no idea who the guy who supposedly was him on the scene.<br /><br />Even young Daniel Radcliffe puts as much effort into his current projects, which are radically different than Harry Potter, as he did into the role that made him famous. Also, \\"Equus\\" showed us that Radcliffe can fill out a g string quite nicely.<br /><br />Soderbergh could have gotten more realism and better performers scouting actual male strip clubs.<br /><br />On top of this, the whole film had a feeling of being shot at someone's condo over a long weekend. I do not know what one calls it when people read lines with little or no emotion, but it ain't acting and not getting one decent performance or turning what you filmed into something watchable ain't directing.<br /><br />I sincerely would not hire Soderbergh to videotape a dog show after seeing bis below-amateur work in every aspect of this steaming pile of celluloid. He can also forget about me watching ANYTHING that he does in the future.<br /><br />This is not to mention that Channing Tatum has absolutely no magic, and that the \\"script\\" did not reveal enough about him or any other character to get the audience involved in their stories. Further, it is hard to believe thatTatum's lugnut of a character has enough charm or overall insight to be the Yoda of the group.
B009GX69RK|4.0|But it's lacking something major from the first season.<br /><br />Zooey's character has become...trashy...and personally I don't think it's a good change from her humor in the first season. It just doesn't work for the actress.<br /><br />I've seen very little in character development in any of the characters throughout the whole season, either.<br /><br />Also, first season is available on hulu, so don't buy if you aren't a huge fan (or just wait for dvd's)
B004XN3FHA|5.0|Went out on a limb and spent over 100 bucks for a flashlight but it was worth it! This thing is crazy bright. It is brighter than lights 3 times its size. It amazes every person that sees it. Go ahead and buy it you will not regret it.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|I read a Jack Reacher novel years ago - somewhere in the middle of the series.  I enjoyed it then, so decided to start at the beginning and work my way through the series.  This first novel had hints of the first Rambo movie - or maybe it was the other way round - a stranger in town being targeted.  It was fast paced and most enjoyable to read.  There is mystery, action, a hero who is a little different, a very good plot and lots of excitement.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and have already read the next in the series and am looking to read the third.
0307455378|5.0|Exellente libro no podia parar de leerlo me tomo solo una semana terminarlo.... fue un libro que me hizo llorar con la niñez de David Martin, me hizo reir con las ocurrencias de isabella y senitir enojo y frustacion contra Grandes y sus dos perros fieles marcos y castelo.....No puedo esperar a empezar a leer el 3er libro de esta preciosa novela El prisionero del cielo..... super recomendable uno de los mejores libros que eh leeido.......<br />Al parecer los tres libros de esta novela son totalmente exelentes...
B009QW7HMC|5.0|When is the new episode being released!?! It should have been released on amazon when the other show aired on tv... This is lame!
B008673ZAQ|2.0|I reluctantly enjoyed book one of the crossfire installment.  Two insanely good-looking millionaires, both abused as children, who have a magnetic but chaotic attraction to each other.  Well, it was entertaining enough for me to want to read the second book...<br /><br />Reflected in You was just too turbulent and extreme.  One minute they were having mind blowing sex and  in love with each other, next minute, she wanted to break off the relationship and he was acting like a jerk again.  It also seemed repetitive.  There is a pattern of Eva and Gideon finally getting along and having things go right, and then another crazy event happens.  In the end of this book, you realize why Gideon was distancing himself, but it is far-fetched.  I have no desire to read the third one, whenever that comes out.
B003EYVXVY|1.0|OMG ** What a let down - the Avatar 3d Blu Ray - was rushed or something - because there is no real visual 3D - no depth, no high grade color, or sound....... complete let down ** I wish I would have waited on my purchase - because after people view this 3D movie - the price is going to dropped considerably - infact I wouldn't buy the 3D if it was 15 bucks.  I how they are going to release a true Avatar 3D Blu Ray.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I was not so sure how I felt about The Hunger Games, but book two really brought it together.  I'm not sure that  I would recommend it to anyone under the age of 14.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|Having owned two Ipads with the nifty covers made by Apple, I was expecting the same quality for my new Kindle Fire.  Sadly it doesn't measure up in any way other than to protect the screen when closed.  The stand up tab on the back doesn't catch properly and is of no use.  Holding any of these devices requires a little assistance from the cover and with this one you get none.  Apple has the best idea for a cover.  Wishing I hadn't left my Ipad in the seat pocket of the airplane.
B00006FDCD|2.0|Maybe it's just me and the fact that I love movies like \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" \\"Saw\\" \\"Jason\\" etc.  But I gave this movie probably five chances, TV version and regular DVD, and I could no get into it.  I mean, yeah killer clowns are typically scary as hell, but not this one, Puppet Master scared me more than this did.  I actually fell asleep a few times through this.  I could only watch maybe an hour before turning off it was so boring.  The only reason for two stars instead of one was because the storyline was not bad and it's from Stephen King, the master of horror.  I give anything and everything from King a chance, but this and some \\"night shift industrial\\" based movie are just beyond boring.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|This book was, for me, not quite as compelling as the first part of this trilogy. That being said, it was a very enjoyable read.
B001IKKMCW|5.0|Yep, that's right, anyone who hates or simply dislikes this movie, has issues.  My family could never get enough of this awesomely epic comedy!!  I would definitely have my kids watch this movie and I'm sure they would love it.  Even my wife loves this movie.  The Mask is definitely a comedy ahead of its time, and Jim Carrey is beyond amazing in this movie.  The scene where they empty his pockets is the funniest scene in the whole movie and I always bust a gut laughing so hard every time.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. It allowed me to imagine the journey of a mom's quest for a child to call her own while following her daughter's journey and the mom who couldn't keep her.
B009OYTIXS|4.0|After watching the first two episodes, I thought to myself, hopefully this brings us away from the Batman fever and feature more new heroes from DC comics.<br />The background story in Arrow though, are too similar to Batman. The classic, I'm back from the dead, I'm a playboy millionaire, I've learnt my ways and trying to right the wrong kind of deal. I see there's potential in this show and I hope that the director and producers will work in making this a more serious and thought provocative show.<br /><br />The one thing that bothers me about this show that it does look really really way too similar to Smallville. And as a guy, a comic hero enthusiast, it's too girly. It gives this Jersey Shore type of feeling, that sometimes when I see certain scenes, I'd like to really shoot the guy that wrote the script. Although I've seen too many Nolan films, the expectation that he sets is too damn high! But given that Arrow is set in a similar background story to Batman, he has to be a bit more darker in his character, rather than spewing out one-liners in all his scenes.<br /><br />Of course, it is interesting to see how Oliver Queen developed is his exceptional archery skills. And that's one of the key factors that will keep me watching this show. I like that this is a character who was not born with superhero powers but developed his skills in a span of 5 years at a deserted island. So I have high hopes for this show, and the writers/director/producers better not screw this one up! =)
B000Y0OBH4|5.0|What can I say?  My son and are totally enamored of this show.  It ranks in the top ten funniest TV comedies, right after Cheers, Dick Van Dyke, and I can't think who else.<br /><br />Witty,charming, realistic, and so darn nerdy!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Amazing story about an amazing man. Such an inspiration to know what Adam Brown encountered ,overcame and achieved in his short life. He is truely a hero, one with character that everyone should strive to be. His faith was empowering. Great read!
B000I0QM04|4.0|I'm always drawn to old movies and books about yesteryear's view of what the future may look like. Sky Captain was unique since it was a modern take on a fictional 30's futuristic environment. Visually cool and unique since all the background was computer generated. But also for that reason it was a bit dark. The Blu-ray version helped make things a little sharper that were previously lost in shadowy vagueness. Its a keeper.
0739368044|5.0|Book is very well written, good action, and goes well with the first two books.I am looking forward to the 4th book in  the series.
034580404X|5.0|I had read this trilogy before buying it! However I am very happy with this! For the simple fact That I just LOVE FSOG!<br />I love the intimate relationship between Christian and Ana! Even though they are not the normal type of couple. If you read between the lines it's basically every relationship everywhere. Definitely recommend this series to all my friends!
B00367XA1K|5.0|Most people today don't know much about the \\"Red\\" period in USA before WW2.  There were so many well meaning people caught up in the dreams of a better world only to suffer terrible disappointment.  This time and its feelings are portrayed in a manner that people today can understand.  This is a true story, these were real people, and their hearts were broken in the end.  We saw a resurgence of this kind of wishful thinking during the Vietnam War, with kids running around college campuses with their little red \\"Mao Thinks\\" books.  Today it's the environmental movement, with its passionate believers in the imminent destruction of the world.  This is a great movie for people who would like an objective lesson for \\"True Believers.\\"  And the acting is outstanding, not a dull scene in the movie.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|This is a great sequel to Bared to You. True to most sequels, it is not quite as good as the first. (I still read it in 2 days, so a great book). It is a little slower to get going, but still a delicious read.

0399157565|1.0|I have read all of PC's book except for the one before this one and I can't finish this one.  In the past I enjoyed Kay S. and all the characters around her and enjoyed the suspense.  WHAT HAPPENED? This is a big book. 663 pages.  I read into the 400s and it was a struggle.  I kept thinking this will get better, please get better.  I can't finish the book.  Unless the last part or the book really heats up, I thought this was boring, painfully boring.  I didn't even recognize Kay.  Did something major happen in the previous book that made her cold against Benton and Lily?  Just didn't feel like the Kay I have read in the past.  I didn't \\"know\\" her anymore.  Unless the real Kay comes back, I'm done with this series.  Normally I feel like I'm visiting friends but not here.  I feel sad about this.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I liked the storyline. I liked it a lot, actually, so much that I read all three. However, I found the explicit parts to be exhausting. Eventually I found myself skipping past them because it was just too much. Honestly, I got bored with them. No one can realistically do it that much. Except people that need professional help. Overall, though, it has a good storyline. Sometimes it seemed a little too similar to Twilight though. Like its the X-rated version with an adult, non-supernatural storyline. And the mention of her \\"inner Goddess\\" and subconscious seemed a little cheesy. I enjoyed it, though.
1606995359|5.0|I bought this after reading a book review in the Wall Street Journal.  I've always said I learned my first economics from Scrooge McDuck then moved on to Milton Friedman, F.A.

B0090SVDO0|4.0|To me, this was one of those shows that was really good compared to a few others by The Doors that have been released. If this had come out instead of \\"Absolutely Live\\", I really think it would have been a massive seller. Why later they made a EP from it on CD but made a DVD of it baffled me. Anyway, the music sounded really good, Morrison was in good spirits during the holiday & was at a great venue that I have been at in the past, one of the best. So check this album out. It is very good from start to finish. If you want the ultimate experience, pick up the DVD. Let the music speak for itself.<br />Drop by my Website sometime for a visit @ \\"JudeMac Foever\\".

B008XBCJ34|3.0|Greetings.  This will be concise and without spoilers.<br />1. This film is hard for me to watch because of many unnecessary \\"dumbings-down\\" of many ideas that all young people I know are capable of handling.<br />2. The film may be visually splendid, but since I watched it in the theatres in 3D, most of it was lost on me.  There is a good scene with a tree.<br />3. Ribisi and Weaver are delightful to see saying just-about-anything.  I know that he's good looking, but Worthington is neither convincing nor watchable... Just another dumb, disenfranchised jock blundering through an overwhelming plot, IMHO.<br />4. With all the advances in CG, why can't they get shading or physics consistent (if not correct)?<br />5. It doesn't greatly bother me that they hijacked plot points from very common sources... but it does bother me that some of the specific stolen sources are so weakly presented.<br />3. There is only one reason I bothered with this review, and that is: that it lifts some excellent points from Ben Bova's \\"Winds of Altair\\" (and Anderson's \\"Call Me Joe\\", among others)... which I think is an excellent young adult sci-fi read.  I am not convinced that the American audience can handle the staging or scope of Bova's text (though, I think most agile young adults can!)... so I am genuinely appreciative that Cameron (or Transformers-guy or whoever-made-this-flick) turned it into Pocahontas so that some of the important themes could make their way onto the big screen.  All IMHO.

B007L6VR6M|5.0|Have you ever looked at someone and, in an instant, felt a powerful connection to them? Something that made you want to abandon your life and run away with them? Not me, but the same can't be said for two teens at the center of the latest comedy from the mind of Wes Anderson.<br /><br />  It's 1965 and, on a small, picturesque island in New England, there are two very unhappy children. One of them, Sam Shakusky (played by Jared Gilman), is an orphan visiting Camp Ivanhoe with his troop of wilderness-oriented Khaki Scouts. The other, Suzy Bishop (played by Kara Hayward), lives on the island with her parents, Walt and Laura (played by veteran actors Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) and three younger brothers. Walt and Laura (Murray and McDormand) are both attorneys who are struggling to maintain both their personal and their professional relationship. One year before the beginning of our story, Sam and Suzy meet backstage during a play which Sam is attending and Suzy is acting in. Despite the brevity of that encounter, the two find themselves inexorably drawn to each other and exchange letters during their separation. They vow to run away together the next summer. We fast-forward to '65 and Sam has vanished from Camp Ivanhoe and done it without alerting his scout master, Randy Ward (played by Edward Norton) or any of his fellow scouts. The search is well underway before the Sheriff, Captain Sharp (played by Bruce Willis) is made aware of the fact that Suzy has vanished as well. When the young lovers meet again, Sam has brought a multitude of camping necessities while Suzy brought books, her cat, records and a record player. They hike and camp for days until finding a deserted cove and make camp, naming their new home Moonrise Kingdom.<br /><br />  Obviously, there is more to the story. There's the revelation that two of the adult characters are involved in a clandestine relationship of their own, additional details of Sam's life story are revealed, and his eventual confrontation with his former scout troop who see it as their responsibility to bring Sam back using any means necessary, including lethal. All this culminates in a scene that had me on the edge of my seat. More than likely, this film, like some of director Wes Anderson's previous efforts, will fail to resonate with the viewing public. I, however, enjoyed it a great deal.confrontation with his former scout troop who see it as their responsibility to bring Sam back using any means necessary, including lethal.

B007XNAOS0|5.0|Baroness' latest release was going to have to work to top the Blue Record in my opinion.  While, I'm not sure Yellow & Green are better than Blue, they are equally as good, while being distinct.<br /><br />Many bands struggle to develop their sound from album to album.  Fans are fickle, they want the same sound, but they don't want recycled riffs and songs that sound like the castoffs from the previous album.<br /><br />Y&G avoid that problem by going mellower instead of heavier as many bands try.<br /><br />I've seen some people write that Y&G sound too commercial, not heavy enough, and that it sounds like Baroness was trying to write songs that would get radio play.  I would contend that Y&G have Baroness' signature riffage all over them, just with less gain, less fuzz (but don't worry, those sweet fuzzed out solos make plenty of appearances), less shouted vocals and more choruses.<br /><br />I can understand some fan's not liking this album, but honestly, its not a departure from their sound, merely an evolution of it.  I can see it drawing in new fans and I look forward to seeing what the band creates after their horrific bus accident on tour to support this release.<br /><br />If you're a fan of songs with intricate riffs, catchy choruses, varied guitar styles, impressive drumming and the occasional gloriously fuzzed out lead, check this out.  Two albums for the price of one.<br /><br />Could it possibly have been shortened to one longer album?  Yes, but most double-albums could.  Even the songs that aren't my favorites don't get skipped, which says quite a bit.
B0090NNQX6|5.0|MIKA is back after three years with a 2-CD, 23 track monster. Solid from start to finish with thumping pop drums, dance beats, grooving soul piano and MIKA's unmistakable voice, The Origin of Love is more of what worked. But there's been a major shift from the Queen-inspired falsetto opera rock (Billy Brown, Big Girl (You Are Beautiful) to club dance-pop (Celebrate Remix, Stardust).<br /><br />No song is lyrically loaded the way the way Life in Cartoon Motion was. Billy Brown told of a middle aged man turning gay, Grace Kelly told of a creepy man's rise. The Origin of Love eschews other people's stories to tell the extended emotional story of romance. Stardust bemoans a lost girl, \\"I could put a little stardust in your eyes/put a little sunshine in your life.\\" Then he gets the chance the next song when Make you happy repeats  \\"All I want to do is make you happy\\" for most of the song. This leads into the beautiful acoustic piano Underwater: \\"You are the port of my call/you shot and leaving me raw/now I know you're amazing/ Cause all I need/ is the love you breathe. Put your lips on me and I can live underwater\\"<br /><br />Mika's sense of humor is still in full force. (I only) love you when I'm drunk is the first upbeat song after 5 love songs. MIKA pokes fun at radio-loved pop stars in Popular song: \\"Standing on the field with your pretty pompons/ Now you're working at the movie selling popular corn/ I could have been a mess but I never went wrong/ Cause I'm putting down my story in a popular song\\" There's a good mix of heartfelt and light fun, keeping the album fresh throughout.<br /><br />Mika has clearly changed in the last three years. His voice is still fantastic but he's less determined to demonstrate his range in every song. He's exploring acoustic and hip-hop and moving away from rock. What he's delivered is his most emotional and soulful album yet.

0439023491|4.0|The book Catching Fire by Suzanne Collins was a very good and enjoyable book. It is the second book in the Hunger Games Trilogy.  It is a science fiction. The theme of the book is anti-violence.  The author uses violence to send the message of anti-violence. I really enjoyed this book. It wasn't as good as the first book in the series but still very good. The book is really hard to put down and is a good easy read.<br /> The book is told in first person which really helps you imagine what the main character Katniss is feeling. In the first book in the Hunger Games trilogy  The country of Panam. Which is supposed to be future North America. There are 12 districts and to keep peace in the land they have an annual Hunger Games. In the Hunger games they send one male and one female between the ages of 12 and 18<br />to fight to the death in an arena.. Katniss was chosen for the games and survived along with the other boy from district 12 named Peeta.<br /> In Catching Fire the counrty of Panam isn't as peaceful as it had always been. There are rumors of a rebellion that Katniss wishes to join even though she knows that she can't because she is always under the eye of the capitol. This year being  the year of the quarter quell which come every 15 years that were written when they decided to do the Hunger Games. This years quarter quell was, \\"On the seventy-fifth anniversary, as a reminder to the rebels that even the strongest among  them cannot overcome the power of the capitol, the male and female tributes will be reaped from the existing pool of victors.\\" This means that Katniss and Peeta will once again be thrown into the arena for another Hunger Games.<br /> I think that the plot of Catching Fire isn't as good as good as the first book in the series but still a good plot. The end of the book was very exciting and keeps you wondering about the third book in the series. I thought that the setting of this arena was better and more exciting than the first book. I recommend this book to people who like a good book. Personally I don't like reading very much but I couldn't put it down. Overall a very good book.nd this book to people who like a good book.

Before I bought this book I checked and was so excited at it's length but so far the first 175 pages could have been written in 20, without all the useless banter.  I'm  very disappointed.  I waited a long time for this book Mr. DeMille......bummer
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is a great way to kill some time and a good way to entertain someone who is bored. The only reason I am giving this app a four instead of a five is because it requested a five star rating and I find that too pushy.

B0091THDOM|5.0|I would give them 5 stars, but the case took over 2 weeks to arrive beyond when it was scheduled.  However, I planned to send it back to them, but after seeing it had to keep it. This is the perfect case for the person that wants to protect their phone while in their pocket.  It is in fact very snug, but does loosen a little overtime but not too much.  Card slot is perfect for business cards or for that one critical credit card.  The material is a nice soft suede, but still glides in and out of jeans pockets easily.  The pull tab is perfect.<br /><br />I keep my phone it with the speaker on top though to ensure the sound is loud enough and to allow access to the headphones.  Overall, I am very impressed with the case, workmanship and fit.  It does not smell cheap, look cheap or anything like some other reviews.  Nice double stitching all the way around.<br /><br />I got the brown, nubuck and am very pleased.<br /><br />Upping them to 5 stars as I reached out to them to pay for the case that I decided to keep and they told me to keep it with no charge.  Stand up company!<br /><br />Also in response to some comments the phone fits just into the case, so the top of the case is flush with the phone.  If you drop the case the corners of the phone are mostly protected and based on the drop test I would not expect the phone to break while in this case.  As for the screen protector, it is pretty snug, I don't use one so can't comment from use, but I would think if applied right you should be ok.
B0090NNQX6|5.0|Just as I had hoped, MIKA\\"S third album \\"The Origin of Love\\" is exactly the album Mika needed to make.  I loved his first two albums but was desperately hoping that he would change his formula for his third release.  He has and with great success.  There really isn't a clunker in the bunch.  He is in fine voice and his uptempo number are fantastic.  Right from the beginning with The Origin of Love thru Make You Happy, Overrated, Emily and Celebrate, he knows how to keep his album on track. He still has his fun side as evident on tracks such as Lola, Love You When I'm Drunk, and Popular Song.  His ballads such as Underwater and Heroes are beautiful.  All in all an almost perfect album.  Since coming out earlier in the year, his music seems more relaxed and Mika is finally able to be himself and sing about the things that are important to him.  He has grown up and so has his music and that's a huge plus for all of us.  I can't wait to see and hear what he does next.  A fantastic CD.  If you love MIKA, you'll love this.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I would give it 10 stars if it were possible. I'm completely addicted.  Can't wait for season 3 to come out?
B008O9V4C2|4.0|Not sure why, but this album sounds like \\"The Nightfly\\" way more than the previous 2 records (Kamakiriad & Morph The Cat).  Must be something to do with the way it was recorded plus placement of the horns and backup vocals or something.<br /><br />I didn't think Morph The Cat was incredible, so this is a real pleasant return to form.  If you like the sound of \\"The Nightfly\\", you will love this.  I would give this 4 1/2 stars if I could.  [Nightfly I would give 5.  Kamakiriad and Morph I would give 3.5 or 4 to each.]<br /><br />Tracks 3 through 7 form an incredibly good suite.  I mean, each song is really really great.  \\"Memorabilia\\" has a great bass line.  The Isaac Hayes cover is very '70s sounding, which makes sense since the original is from 1978 or thereabouts.  \\"Miss Marlene\\" sounds a lot like \\"I.G.Y.\\" - same beat, but it's really great.<br /><br />If you like Steely Dan / Donald Fagen, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Not sure I understand any negative reviews saying this is nothing new.  I mean, yes, that might be true.  But he does it so well.

1451627297|5.0|Prior to picking up 11/22/63, I had never read a Stephen King novel. I had, like many, seen some of the movies based on his work. Having just finished his latest, and what many are calling his greatest, I regret that I hadn't picked up \\"Carrie\\" or \\"The Shining\\" sooner. While imperfect in some ways, 11/22/63 is a perfect thriller in all the ways that matter. I devoured the 800+ pages with breakneck speed, and taking breaks was monumentally difficult. If you start reading, make sure you don't have any major life events pressing in the near future, and prepare to be utterly absorbed.

Luckily there are plenty of unofficial shows out there - even if they are not excellent audio at least they are full concerts!!

B004Q7DQLS|5.0|Pias mother taught her to lay low, don't attract attention, always run and never ever tell anyone anything about you. When Pias mother dies and she gets lonely she tells her boyfriend some things that she shouldn't have, after they break up he blackmails her into stealing something. She has to something from Dragos the oldest, strongest and scariest wyr and now the chase is on. Pia runs away and Dragos follows her and when he catches her, he decides to keep. Pia has to figure out if she can trust Dragos with all her secrets, while Dragos has to figure out how to deal with Pia being independent so they can be together. That's if their enemies don't kill them first. I absolutely love the world that Harrison created in this book; her descriptions of the surrounding were very vivid. When she described the smell of the people and dungeon I was wrinkling my nose at just the thought of it. The heroine was strong and didn't wait to be rescued but she allowed the hero to take care when she knew she needed. Her sense of humor had me laughing entire book, even in the tense situations. The hero was a big alpha male who always got his way and it was funny to see him stumbling around and trying to figure out what was going. They are complete opposites yet they make it work, the secondary characters add depth and conflict into the story. The plot is good and the writing is smooth and the pace of the story is just right. I love the story of Pia and Dragos and hope to see them again.

B001OST0LW|3.0|If you are at all interested, I would get the 2-disc special edition of Batman Forever. Like the similar sets for each of the other Burton/Schumacher Batman films, it packs a terrific array of special features. The most thought provoking part of those features, for me, is the documentary segment that discusses how some of the deleted scenes were cut in order to keep the film from being too dark. (Understandable in the wake of Batman Returns.) The thing is that these scenes were the emotional heart of the screenplay, giving psychological insight into Bruce Wayne in a way that tied many of the other parts of the film together. A true pity that the theatrical cut neglected some of the deepest moments of storytelling.<br /><br />Anyway, in general, I think that Batman Forever is much, much better than its sequel, Batman & Robin. The main difference is that this one has a very good story, and for the most part sticks to telling it. In my opinion, Val Kilmer is a terrific Bruce Wayne/Batman, and Chris O'Donnell's portrayal of Robin is perfect; in fact, the Robin backstory is incredibly good, arguably the best part of the film. Nichole Kidman is great playing a psychologist, and if her character is a bit underdeveloped, Dr. Chase Meridian fits perfectly into the storyline. My personal biggest gripe with Batman Forever is that the villains are portrayed way over the top. In the case of Jim Carrey as the Riddler, that can nearly be forgiven, as he is ridiculously entertaining. However, Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face was just too much, a waste of a great character. (The role played by Aaron Eckhart in The Dark Knight was so much better.)<br /><br />Some people did not like the aesthetic design of Batman Forever. It is a visual spectacle, often overloading the senses, and I agree that nipples on the costumes was unecessary. However, I think that many of the stylistic touches, including the more futuristic Batmobile, the gang of punks with lightsticks and day-glo grafitti, and theuse of some techno music in the soundtrack, were actually good, timely touches. If this film had stuck to those guns a bit more, it could have almost verged into a genuinely edgy cyberpunk territory.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is not a bad film. I wish that it had been more serious, but it does have its moments. It was a huge success upon its release, and although it has suffered quite a bit by being associated with Joel Schumacher's next outing, Batman & Robin, it is still worth giving a chance, especially if you are a longtime Batman fan and, like me, you remember how incredibly cool this was back in 1995.

Although I would say slightly unbelievable that Matthew McConaughey's character is such a genius while drinking quite so much.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|I read historical novels mostly for the history. The story and characters are very good and work well in presenting the history. The history itself is excellent.

B001GUXJQA|4.0|I like how Michael has woven the characters from other books into the stories for more recent books.  While they were not the primary character in one of the earlier books, you have a sense of that character when he/she becomes the primary character.  You have a feeling that you know them and are more interested in the plot.<br />I enjoy all of his books.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|One could make the argument that Donald Fagen has been making the same record over and over since Gaucho. But that isn't a bad thing. I like this record and realize that the days of Steely Dan in full thrust are part of my old school, so we move on. In Fagen's world, it's NY and North Jersey rhythm and blues and that sort of chic provides a nice experience and many satisfying listening moments. There is nothing very adventurous here, but it is all executed with such high standards that in many ways, he is North Jersey's Steve Winwood. Maybe not with the same punch, but you know what you're getting and it's a good listen. I thought Fagen's take on the Isaac Hayes tune is a standout, but they are all from a certain qualitatively strong source. This is music the Brill building would have made had it turned toward jazz, so, so long as you are not expecting Fagen to pick up where Aja left off, and recognize that from Gaucho on, it's been the same record, you'll enjoy this.

B005EWDA9M|5.0|NOTE SPOILERS AHEAD!<br />For a novel comprising three distinct sections (in fact, it was originally sold as a trilogy), and whose canvas is so expansive, 1Q84 is an extraordinarily engaging piece of work ... I am including the third part in this review, as I have (of course!) read the whole. The novel follows the paths of Tengo and Aomame, two people who met - fleetingly - as primary school students. When Tengo acts to prevent Aomame from being persecuted, she reaches out, despite her restrictive and joyless background and touches him. It's a moment neither of them has ever forgotten.<br />Aomame has become an avenging angel for a group which seeks out men who perform acts of gross and irremediable cruelty and violence against women. She murders them, invisibly, and without attracting attention to her actions or her cause. Tengo is a maths teacher who wants to be a writer. He also reads stories submitted for a competition, and through this, reads one that is - although flawed - a gem. Through his editor, Tengo becomes embroiled in a plan to covertly recraft the story and submit it - without acknowledging his contribution - for the competition. They do, and it wins. Its subject matter sets off a train of brutal and potentially dire events, as despite its apparently fantastical subject matter, the story turns out to be true: there is a closed community (called Sakigake) whose Leader is some kind of savant, and whose group's actions involve violence and murder. Aomame is drawn into conflict with the group when her mentor discovers a young girl, apparently abused by the commune leader. She asks Aomame to carry out her 'last job' and kill the man. The people of Sakigake are watching both Tengo and Aomame, as they become aware of the scrutiny they are under. Aomame - who alights from a taxi in the middle of a freeway traffic jam, and slips out of 1984 and into a parallel year that she calls 1Q84 - and Tengo gradually find that they are on separate, but gradually merging paths. In the end, fulfilment for the two seems improbable in the world they are in. Murakami's writing - even in translation (or should I say through translation, since I don't read Japanese!) - is melodic, and characterised by those moments of intuitive, inventive or perceptive brilliance that simply take the breath away. tengo and Aomame are entrancing characters, and their slow passage towards love is both poignant and romantically satisfying. It's a mammoth achievement for Murakami to sustain the colourful brilliance of his shorter works through a body of work of such dimmensions. He succeeds wonderfully.paths.

1607066017|2.0|So...<br /><br />I read the Saga trade paper last night. I guess it speaks to the comic (good and bad) that i finished it in one sitting.<br /><br />First: Good things *warning spoilers*<br /><br />I thought the plot and the storytelling was really engaging. Finding out that the narrator was one of the characters I really enjoyed. There are a lot of questions in the comic that I think i genuinely want to know the answers to. It made me curious about some back stories and whats going to happen next. I like the spirit that guides them on their escape from the planet and was hoping she would stick around. It appears tho that in like the second last page she may have been destroyed by something. Its hard to tell or really know but i can say that i would want to find out in the next installment.<br /><br />That being said, this comic is definitely NOT for me. Its not bad, I definitely enjoyed reading it but I won't be reading further. Here is why:<br /><br />Some of the things in it felt totally random. Like the robot that has a television for a face named Prince Robot IV. I cant tell if its a joke or for real. It just confuses me.<br /><br />Also:<br />Giant Spider Boob Monster<br /><br />First of all... spiders don't have mammary glands. Maybe I'm not the target audience but why does your spider monster have to have giant boobs?<br /><br />Actual drawings of nubbly bits are all over this comic... and you know i'm not offended by it but it felt like it was gratuitous. Its not tasteful, its not artistic and it feels like its in there for the teenage boys.<br /><br />Seeing the mother breastfeeding her newborn, its tasteful, it makes you bond with the character and it makes it real. It builds my relationship with the character.<br /><br />Watching the mercenary walk thru like 14 panels of people having sex in the background only to be offered a 6 year old sex slave kind of weirds me out... not gonna lie.<br /><br />Did i mention the giant spider boob monster? o_0<br /><br/>Anyway its obvious that the art is not too my taste. The backgrounds and details were sort of meh for me. Not alot to look at. Reading the trade paper collections usually at the end of each issue I go back and go thru every panel to look at the art just to enjoy it because sometimes I miss really cool things when i'm caught up in the action or eager to find out what happens. Didn't do that with this book.

B005QMOZOO|2.0|Death Comes to Pemberly. P.D. James.<br /><br />I was so disappointed in this book as I know P.D.James is a good and well regarded writer. She has seemingly made little attempt to capture the characters as created by Jane Austen and develop them in their new situations.They are so boring, especially Lizzie.<br />Darcy is reduced to a stick figure.<br />Adding characters from other Austen books later in the story was quixotic and contrived.<br />Even the plot failed to convince.<br />Sorry P.D.
B008R14YBK|5.0|Great full-length effort by Bridgit Mendler. Catchy pop songs with a cool sort of island vibe to it here and there -- sort of reminds me of Amazulu a little bit in certain parts in that regard. Overall this is a great record that is strong throughout with no duds. There is a good blend of straight up pop songs mixed with a few more reflective tracks. Best part about Bridgit Mendler is that she can actually sing live. This should do well.

B008TMA1LY|2.0|However, it is very limited in what you can do unless you are willing to spend money to buy heart coins. The money you earn within the game can only be used to upgrade some items. Once you get above a certain level, upgrading actually seems to slow things down a bit so you don't do as well on that higher level as you did on the lower levels. It takes a long, long time to earn enough heart coins to buy more help and you have to remember to collect your daily deals every day (each 24 hours, or more) to get those heart coins which means you have to access the internet every day.<br /><br />Additionally, some of the items actually have a bit of invisible overlap so that you think you are tapping on the correct item but you are not and the game will ignore you until find the exact spot to trigger that event. Very frustrating.\<br /><br />UPDATE -<br />Something has happened to change the game. Now it is very slow and jerky. It is very difficult to keep up with the demands of the game as the characters are not necessarily responding to the command that you think they should. If you consider how long it takes to earn enough points to buy anything or get more help, balanced against how poorly the game is running, I don't think it is worth it. Downgrade from 4 stars to 2.

Simple resolutions, I also didn't like. Complicate it a little bit.<br /><br />While I enjoyed this series immensely and am in the process of rereading it, I think so much more could have been elaborated and incorporated into this book to make it the talk of the decade. I dream about the 1st book and the last book provides details to may items you wonder about, but there is still unanswered questions. I just felt like there are gaps.<br /><br />I sincerely hope the movie I keep hearing about takes the book and runs with it as typical Hollywood does. Look forward to it. Excellent read. Glad I embarked on this journey, but wish it was better executed.

B0080SW3CC|5.0|Good books keep the reader interested, but great books change the reader's life. In my opinion, \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" by John Steinbeck is a great book. This novel of only 117 pages is one that everyone should have in their library of knowledge. Giving numerous genres such as comedic, tragic, and dramatic, the reader is always on edge, never being able to guess what will come next. Not only is \\"Of Mice and Men\\" entertaining, but its unique use of challenging lessons and emotions in a reasonable amount of pages make it memorable and life changing.<br />I've always believed that shorter books are usually the most entertaining and the easiest to understand. Though it takes a little bit of an effort to understand the unique grammar, this novel is highly entertaining. With fewer pages, there is less fluff, and \\"Of Mice and Men\\" definitely gets straight to the point with its simplistic yet diverse genre. There aren't too many books that can fit more than one genre in just 117 pages. This characteristic makes \\"Of Mice and Men\\" all the more unique. The reader can do nothing but laugh at the use of swearing by the strong personality characters presenting the traits of a comedy. Tragedy is evident with the event of unfortunate death, and with the many transforming circumstances, there is nothing but drama. These varying genres along with the creative use of broken English demand the reader to engage in the text mentally and emotionally. The reader's heart will just melt with how innocent the character Lenny is and how much the other characters mistreat him. Or one may become angry at how much trouble Curly's wife causes with her mischief. \\"Of Mice and Men\\" will make the reader laugh, cry, think, and rage in fury. This smorgasbord of emotions heighten the plot of the story and make this novel that more entertaining. One can appreciate the play on emotions, keeping the reader intrigued and asking for more. As if the great personalities and engaging plot weren't enough to remember,this novel also presents topics and lessons that are truly influential.<br />Of Mice and Men is a great book that anyone can enjoy. As if more proof was needed for it's greatness, this novel can also be found in the form of a movie. Such an eventful 117 pages was worthy of more than one entertaining form. With loveable characters, a heart wrenching ending, and such a small amount of pages, this easy read is surely unforgettable. Its jaw-dropping ending will have you begging for more. It's attractive length and tone can't be denied. Without spoiling the best parts, I would encourage anyone to pick it up. It would only take a day, and I promise that you wont regret or forget it.
B007THA4FI|4.0|First, I'm not all the way through \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" but I feel as though I can make a well-informed honest review at this point. Here's my advice: Do NOT go into this book expecting 1) A CHILDREN'S story; 2) Feel good, Dumbledore & Harry Save the Day stories; 3) Harry Potter. This is Rowlings first attempt at writing for ADULTS and she did a phenomenal job. Why did people love HP so much? The original storyline? No. We've all heard/read stories of good vs. evil our entire lives... no originality there.. It was her characterization and the connections she made within those characters. It's the familiarity of those characters that made you fall in love. Every single book-nerdy girl felt like Hermione at times or awkward boy felt like Neville... we related to the characters, not the story. And \\"Vacancy\\" does not fail in that aspect. Am I loving the storyline? Not entirely, but I knew I wouldn't by reading the synopsis... it's just not my \\"style\\" of story but she's sucking me in anyway. She makes me love and hate those characters because I KNOW them.. they exist in my neighborhood, just like they exist in yours. She really brings the story to life IF you can put down your magic wand and use your grown-up brain. And yes, she uses the big four letter \\"c\\" word most famously used in \\"Atonement\\". Get over it. It's an adult novel.. there's bound to be some language & I'm sure your teenage son as thought/said it at least once.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I had such high hopes after falling in love with the first book, but was disappointed. A great book don't get me wrong, but there was so much possibility (I feel the same about the 3rd as well). I felt like none of the great scenes/situations were followed through to make this book spectacular. Some of the scenes where such buildup for a quick simple resolution and let down. This book was all lovey dovey and sex (not super kinky like you'd expect) between Christian and Anastasia. She didn't delve that much into his world either, just kinky sex.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|This book feels really rushed and poorly conceived. The first book was a well written '50 shades of Grey' but this follow up is as bad or worse than that series. I won't spoil the ending but tell me you'd react the way Eva does.<br /><br />Save your money...

B009SSGBOE|2.0|I waited with some anticipation for Donald Fagen's latest creation.  I've listened to it once and....where have I heard this all before?  On the whole, I'd say this \\"new\\" CD sounds like stuff they didn't release from 20 years worth of recording sessions or some weird compilation of B sides.  I'm so unimpressed I don't have the interest to go into a cut-by-cut analysis of the tunes, and part of the reason is that they all sound alike.  Roughly the same tempo and overall sound... \\"Sunken Condos\\" is an aural blur.  I think Mr. F. has done most of these themes to death as well.  He's not saying anything new, the lyrics are sort of boring and lack the crypto-poetic elegance of old.  Donald, we've all been there when you've dcne that, we remember you when so quit while you're still (marginally) ahead.  Don't become a one-trick pony ridden by a naked emperor.
0525953728|5.0|With all the controversy over NO EASY DAY, I needed to read the author's account of the mission.  After reading the book, I felt just like I had prior to reading it.  This SEAL did not expose anything that was not already known.  What he did was set the events in order so that the mission will be recorded correctly.  A SEAL's mission and life experiences in the military are not like other organizations.  It is a constant hard readiness experience in order to keep them prepared for the missions they are assigned.  NO EASY DAY helps the public understand what their life is like.  People like the author are rare, and I am thankful for his contributions to the safety of our nation.  The other copies of this book that I purchased went to members of the deployed military.
B005C7SXMS|5.0|There is some great satire in this funny off beat film, great acting, and very nice writing. Oliver personifies the typical adolescent looking to lose his virginity and escaping awkward and painful times in his own imagination. The early sequence of how he imagines his own death playing out is priceless. His first real relationship falling apart was treated fairly calmly. One might expect the character's reaction to be a bit more extreme, but it was wonderful. I love this film.
B00846TTDG|5.0|Acts of Valor was very inspirational.  It's good to see men, women and a child (true story) stand up for what they believed.  I can't believe this was rated so low.  I highly recommend it.
0061692042|1.0|characters devoid of interest, but do fit in with a purposeless plot - or rather two plots as thé novel is so devided. the third episode is touchingly written, only reminds the reader of the slightness - and dubious reality of what was earlier narrated.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I came late to the party, you might say with firefly. Saw Serenity on tv and started searching for the series, found it and fell in love with the whole Verse'. This is one of those shows that just gets better every time you watch it, and I can enjoy with my wife and two teenagers. Sure wish they had kept it on for a few more seasons.
B007THA4FI|1.0|This was one the most depressing books I have ever read, and it had none of the fun or imagination of the Harry Potter series. I will be very unlikely to read any of Ms. Rowling's future books.
B0097EWK3A|1.0|This MIGHT have been a good game, if I could have ever gotten past the part where you enter your name. Tried both the free &amp; paid versions several times, each time same thing, wouldn't go past the &quot;Enter Name&quot; part. Lost quite a sum of money on this.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I used to play this game on facebook and LOVED it. now that I can play it without dealing with facebook it is even better!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|overall a good game, could use some fine tuning though to improve reaction time and playability. but is a good time killer
0525952926|1.0|Pricing, Pricing, Pricing!  What are you guys thinking?  Kindle offers a convenience which has led me to buy more books... but these prices are putting a real damper on my buying.  The old price elsat(ic) has just snapped.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I LOVE this tv show!!! I am so addicted to it. I bought season 2 right away!!<br />I greatly recommend it to anyone! (note: NOT good for younger viewers, contains very graphic scenes)
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoy a good mystery with suspense, full of human interest and plots that are complicated.  As I read I try to figure out where the story is going...who the \\"who dun-nit\\" is! Gone Girl certainly allowed me to go in all of those directions and my mind was  active as I discerned just happened to the Gone Girl. The moment that what I call evil,became apparent,I was discouraged and even sickened.  The book ended without hope and not only that but with a sign that the evil would continue, that the life of a child would be involved in it. As I see it, there must always be hope, always.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I liked this book.  I downloaded it after reading some reviews and then reading the first couple of chapters available to preview.  I like the way the author used the pictures throughout the book.  I agree with some of the others about the ending, though.  The ending opened up opportunity for sequels, but I am not sure that I would like to see a series out of this.  It should have ended straight up, without the open ending.
B00000AFFF|5.0|I'm an Elvis Costello fan from way back. That said, when I heard Elvis was teaming up with Burt Bacharach, I thought.. \\"wha?!?!?!\\" It seemed a bizarre pairing that had little chance of working... Elvis, the \\"angry young man\\" and Burt, the purveyor of Dionne Warwick-warbled 60s schmaltz. It was like Jimi Hendrix opening for the Monkees. (which actually happened.)  Then I heard it. As it turns out, this is one of those classic, dare I say it, \\"masterpiece\\" albums that comes along once every decade, if you're lucky. Elvis is the ultimate interpreter of Burt Bacharach songs, in my opinion. Yes, he strains to hit those high notes, and his voice isn't syrupy sweet like most of the others to tackle Bacharach's work, but this is a good thing. Where other interpreters of Bachrach's songs come off saccharine and fake and frankly put me off a lot of the time, Elvis makes it genuine. Stand out tracks include \\"This House Is Empty Now\\", and \\"Painted From Memory\\", but there's not a clinker in the bunch. Flawless musicianship from some of the top session musicians including Dean Parks, Greg Phillingaines and Jim Keltner polish it to perfection. One of the finest moments of both Elvis & Burt's careers, in my opinion. A classic not to be missed.
B009EAO38C|5.0|This piano/cello music I could listen to all the time.  I like their arrangement of the different songs.  Very enjoyable.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|Wow - Not what I expected in a bargain book. The story was well written and kept my attention throughout.  This book has some good plot twists that I didn't see coming.  I can't wait the read the rest of the series.
B0091REZMW|5.0|cool game so far can not wait to see what will happen next. would love for power to restore a little faster
B0087HT36U|4.0|Like the angry  birds but from the front. My 5 year old son and I enjoyed it.<br />Is a bit of in need of polish but solid overall.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am in love with pinterest!!! Wonderful product! Cant live without it! There is something for everyone. Lots of different titles to search.
B008WCP2PG|1.0|I wanted so bad to like this movie but I have never seen a movie as bad as this one!! The characters weren't developed at all, you see one scene then it would stop and jump to something else and never continue with what happened before !! I can say the scene I liked was when Channing Tatum did his solo & that was it!! This movie left me sooo disappointed !! I heard they are trying to make a second one...PLEASE DON'T !!!!!!!!
B004GYY714|4.0|Finally a product that is easy to use for a baby boomer like me.  I love tune in radio, able to listen to diferrent radio  stations, and save to favorites. I was having such a hard time trying to find local radio stations , now I have them listed on my favorites. The only thing that sometimes happens ,if I shake my Kindle it will switch to another radio station. I just discovered the podcast feature.
B0067RQYNW|3.0|This app is ok, but it did not handle my files as seamlessly as I would have liked. Nevertheless, it is a good starter program if you don't want to spend more money.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was one of those outcast wonders. Though I do not recommend for younger children, everyone should read this book. It left me tearing up a bit at the ending.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book had me hooked from the second I picked it up.All i could think about was this book,it had such good imagery i caught myself  day dreaming of it multiple times.
B000006047|2.0|Felt mislead with LP-replica in the title.  Quality of CD recording does not sound like it is an official production release.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|One Word: AMAZINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG !!! This show is so good !!! Vampires, Werewolfs, Witches, What could be better, the love triangles are amazing you get so attached to these characters I talk about them like I know them personally !!! Just an awesome show to escape reality every thrusday !!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|That is what I'm talking about she stood her ground with him and didn't back down. She let him know what she like and didn't like. But the spanking she need some help with that. But if she like it what can one say.
B00943SQCI|5.0|We love this movie.  A couple of years ago, we watched every episode of the original Dark Shadows series, then everything \\"Dark Shadows\\" we could get our hands on. This movie was great for us because of the many parallels and references to the original series. And it is typical Tim Burton with another great Johnny Depp performance. If you don't know the original series, or don't like Tim Burton, the fun of this film may be lost on you.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying this show because it is so well written!  The characters are developing, the plot is thickening, twisted clues ... well done whoever you are!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was told by some that the ending would disappoint me but it did not.  Well written books are well written books.  Read and see for yourself!
0345525558|5.0|I've been eyeing this book for a long time and finally bought for a book club. I finished it the next day; it was such an easy read. The author draws on her experience as a foster parent to write from the perspective of a foster child's struggle within the system and upon emancipation.<br /><br />I love a strong female cast helping each other out rather than fighting over some guy. Throw in the gorgeous backdrop that is San Francisco, the romance of Victorian symbolism, multi-generational mysteries, well-paced character growth, and all that's missing is chocolate...which was remedied nicely by a late night run to Starbucks for a brownie and political joking with fellow customers exactly halfway through.
B000OLRM2O|4.0|Every new generation seems to know or care less about history and the significant events and personalities that shaped our time. Muhammad Ali is arguably a very important cultural icon not only because of his achievements as a Boxer, winning the heavy weight title three times, but also because of his perseverance to define himself and broadcast his personality in a time when American culture aimed to silence him. All these themes were presented in this film; presented very well. Will Smith proves to be a versatile and proficient actor. He is so effective that you forget that he is the Will Smith of the Fresh Prince of Bel Air, MIB, I Am Legend etc. In this film, you just see Muhammad Ali, the boxer, the personality, the human being.<br /><br />The cinematography is exquisite and unlike any previous boxing movie. The fight scenes seems to be subdued in an effort to make it more realistic. The punches don't have the big hollywood, Rocky-ish sound effects and exaggerated blows that shock the whole arena. Albeit pivotal moments in the fights are presented in cinematic forms that have not been shown before.<br /><br />Overall, it is a great film that presents not only Ali the great boxer but the real human being. Not to be mistaken as purely historical, the film is effective in prompting the young viewer outside the scope of the late sixties to learn more about the great Muhammad Ali.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book didn't know what they would next.Could't wait to get start book 2&3.This book kelp me wondering what she would next. How she would subcome to him because she was new to sex and didn't know what to expect or use what her dad tought her over the years.
B008BGNMZU|4.0|Always good to hear from Fourplay. Can count on superb musicianship and tight presentation.<br /><br />Love Nathan East's solid bassline runs.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Loved this Movie!!!  watched it 3 times in a row....loved the surprise humor.  would buy for our collection.  definitely recommend
B0096PAA6E|3.0|This album is one of the biggest head scratchers I have ever heard.  The songs nearly alternate between outstanding and unlistenable all the way through.  I can't help but feel poor Mr. Clark was influenced by the big-time producers and Warner Bros. to include some radio-friendly nonsense like The Life (seriously, how embarrassed would you be if you were blasting that song and someone came in the room?).  I think the album overall is a bit overproduced and studio-gimmicky, when they should have let this wonderful talent do what he does best.  I would recommend downloading:  When My Train Pulls In, Numb, Bright Lights, Third Stone......, and Next Door Neighbor Blues.  I wish I had previewed the album before buying, because I certainly can't imagine putting on Please Come Home or The Life anytime soon.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|I loved it. it was sad but a great  book. i enjoyed readijg it. it made me cry so much.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This app does what it is supposed to do. I like that I can have my own music wake me up. Even when the Kindle is off, the alarm still works.
B00607EWYC|1.0|Maybe it is just my reading taste, but I deleted this from my kindle after about 30 pages.  Made no sense to me.
B007SGM084|5.0|OMG! Don't usually use thoes letters,not my generation,but it is exactly the words to describe this trilogy! Mind blowing from the first word to the last,there's quite a few times you'd like to jump into the story and beat the crap out of a few characters,but all in all very well written. I do hope the authors next endever is just as stimulating and look forward to finding out.
0385742886|4.0|The Kill Order<br /> by James Dashner<br /><br />Also In Series:<br /><br /> Maze Runner<br /> Scorch Trials<br /> Death Cure<br /><br />In the prequel to the best selling Maze Runner trilogy, you meet Mark and Trina. Before, there was a Maze, before there was WICKED there was the flares, and there was the aftermath. This is the world that Mark and Trina live in now. On their way home from school, the world changed in an instant. Turning from luxury to survival in a heartbeat. Now, out in the wilderness they are trying to make peace with everything they've lost and what they have gained along the way.<br /><br />Problem is, the world is looking to change the peace. The fragile peace is shattered when the Berg's show up and people begin to die. Now, there is a strange illness and it's taking over the population faster than anyone could have ever imagined. But who is behind the illness, what does it really do, what was it's real purpose? Mark and Trina are destined to find out!<br /><br />I was so excited to pick this book up. To be honest, since I read the Maze Runner, I have been in love with the writings of James Dashner. He is truly gifted at creating a world and making sure that you have no idea what is happening or what is coming. Constant surprises abound in the novels that he writes. One might think, that because this is the prequel to his amazingly popular series that it is obviously, not going to be as exciting. They would be wrong. Dashner, makes sure to enlighten his readers to things that you would never dream of happening. Things you never thought of. Things that happened long before Thomas and the crew entered the maze.<br /><br />I loved the way that he didn't start completely at the beginning. To be honest, I thought, initially the book would be told by someone in WICKED that created the Flare, or perhaps, something similar. I was wrong. Much like the Maze Runner, the story is told by the teens that are living in the world plagued by the madness that is now around every corner. In the Maze Runner, the Flare is here and there, but in the prequel you will find that it plays a huge staring role. Giving people a much better view of what the Flare is like and how it begins, ends, etc.<br /><br />I loooooved the character development in this novel. The way Mark changed from the first page to the last.. I can't give too much away, but it was phenomenal. A mark of a true writer. I think anyone that has not read the Maze Runner should. It's one of my favorite dystopian teen novel series. Not to mention, the Prequel just rounds it out even more. I'm not sure if Dashner intends to write another prequel, to explain what happens after the end of the Kill Order, or if instead, that is where the Maze really begins. But, overall, I thought it really rounded out the series.<br /><br />4.5 stars!!!is now around every corner.

B004D1CK32|5.0|If you like this movie and happen to enjoy Japanese anime you should see the Samurai 7 version...  Very good!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It's very entertaining. My daughter loves archiving the goals and completing families..very easy very fun. When she's not playing with it I get on and collect her coins lol it's an addictive game.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|I enjoyed the DVD of Red Tails and the history behide it . Cuba Gooding Jr did a great job in this picture of the work that was done by the Army Air Corp in WWII.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|I saw Gary Clark Jr perform on the first day of Chicago leg of the Dave Matthews Band Caravan last summer (July 8, 2011), and I have been waiting for him to release a full album ever since that day. Shortly after Gary Clark Jr started playing that day I knew that I would be buying any album he released on day one. Until today, I had been living off a fan's audience recording of Clark Jr's performance at the Caravan, but now I have an entire album and a wider variety of music to experience.<br /><br />But enough about me. Here is my take on the album:<br /><br />The tracks range from up tempo (Ain't Messin' 'Round; Travis County) to a bit of hip hop (Blak and Blu, The Life) to blues (Bright Lights) to a \\"crunchy\\" cover of 'Third Stone from the Sun.' I love the throw back to the Chuck Berry style guitar in 'Travis County,' and even though it is the second shortest song on the album it is one of my favorites already. 'Bright Lights' is one of the biggest highlights from the first time I heard Gary Clark Jr, so I was excited to see it included on this album and it does not disappoint. Finally, I want to comment on 'Next Door Neighbor Blues.' As soon as that track started playing I immediately thought of Robert Johnson and other early blues artists. It sounds like it was recorded in the studio next to Johnson back in the '30s, and I mean that in the best way possible. You can really hear the influence that old-time blues has had on Clark Jr not only in the recording style of this song, but also in story in the lyrics and the way he plays his acoustic guitar. It is truly one of the gems of the album.<br /><br />I have been through the album twice, and it will be playing on a loop in my car and on my iPod for the next day or so before settling into my regular rotation.<br /><br />Overall, if you're a fan of excellent guitar work with a heavy blues influence, you should pick up a copy of 'Blak and Blu.'
B009KHDT0C|3.0|It reminded me more of the Addam Family than it did Dark Shadows.  I would have rather had the drama over the comedy on this one....
0375869026|5.0|Wonder, by R.J. Palacio is an exceptionally written middle-grade novel that captures the pain of bullying so poignantly, so beautifully, that the story and its message resonate long after the last page is turned. If I were still teaching (grades 4-6), I would buy a class set of this novel, and we would spend the month of October reading and discussing it to lay a foundation for mutual understanding and to facilitate a culture of kindness. Even if you don't routinely read children's books just for the joy of experiencing the quality literature being produced in that category today, you should make an exception for this book. But have tissues handy. Really.<br /><br />  \\"... in the future you make for yourselves, anything is possible. If every single person in this room made it a rule that wherever you are, whenever you can, you will try to act a little kinder than is necessary--the world really would be a better place.\\"
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Game with lots of variety. Grinding out points can take a little while but keeps you busy for hours. Still a lot of fun!
B008LZHA3G|5.0|I must say that Bob Dylan surprised me with one of his most outstanding modern albums.  For a Bob Dylan fans, this album is a must. For first time listeners, you'll really like the songs and ballads.  They hold your attention.
B001NSAJ3G|5.0|I loved the album when it first came out and got it on cd and now on Amazon.  I love the Prime on Amazon so I can download it anytime I want or listen to it on my Kindle or Laptop.
1423140605|5.0|This book was completely fabulous. It inspired me to read other books by this amazing author. I'm so so glad that Annabeth and Percy stayed together and I hope that they don't break up in the next book. If the author feels compeled to make them break up, then he should just make them have a cute death instead. A cute death is when they refuse to let the other one die, so they both die together and live together in the underworld. I think it was the best book I have ever stumbled across and I can't wait to read the next one. I denfinetly give this book two thumbs up!!!!!!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This series is wonderfully written and so good you hate to put them down. Book 3 is better so far than book 1. This series is a must read
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Not Fifty Shades but the next best thing. You should definetly read this book. There are a lot of similarities between this book and Fifty Shades
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love it...fun game...good time killer...favorite real world game now fun for my kindle!  plus it was a free download, can't beat that
B009KHDT0C|5.0|It was fabulous and Johnny Depp was great as always.  Burton is the best director ever and I love all his movies.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I just love this website and I use it all the time :) I am glad that my Kindle fire has the app!
B008NABUU8|5.0|Updated review: this took way too long but i couldn't figure out how to edit a review. This game is well deserving of 5 stars. I beat it in a couple of days but it was so fun. Couldn't put it down, which is why i beat it so quickly. Highly recommended to anyone.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very entertaining and well written, and you really don't see things coming, I think this would make an excellent movie or TV series!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I bought this Kindle book based on the posted reviews for it.  And they were right.  It is a very entertaining read.  Reminds me of early Silverberg.  Buy it, you won't be disappointed.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Mr Riordan has hit another out of the park literary homerun with his newest book in \\"The Heroes of Olympus\\" series. This book continues the thrilling adventures of the Greek & Roman demigods as they attempt to complete their quest. Although written for teens it is entertaining enough for this 62 year old. I will continue to recommend this author for light entertainment reading.
B008NR8YTQ|5.0|I bought this disc because I am a huge Gary Moore fan.  I haven't really \\"gotten\\" Jimi Hendrix.  This concert fixed that!  I now find myself playing songs from the concert in my mind & bought a Jimi Hendrix CD.  I prefer Gary Moore's versions though.  I was very pleasantly surprised.
030758836X|5.0|Great book. Very suspenseful and fun, the characters are relateable and it is very well written (unlike my rushed review). Would def recommend to anyone!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed the book.  The movie would have been better if I had read it first.     It was very slow in the beginning  but having read the book you can get much more from it.  Anxious to start the 2nd book!
140132634X|5.0|I had read a few of Mitch Albom's other books and I really enjoyed them so I was eagerly awaiting \\"The Time Keeper\\".  I was not disappointed; the book was fantastic! I really enjoyed listening to it on CD in the car, too. The person reading did a really great job!
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Just as listed. Great quality. Movies are seen as never before. The extras gives another view of how the movie was made. Thanks!
B005QPGHQU|5.0|halestorm again comes out with a great album. Even though a couple of the songs are certainly written for the pop radio market, the flow of the track list and the quality of the composition is wonderful. They are defining their own sound now with certain 'halestorm' melody figures and chord changes and I like it
1401223176|5.0|Batman: Hush is just one of those graphic novels that, before it was even released, was already a hit. Comic book fans could not wait to see what the industry's finest (artist Jim Lee and writer Jeph Loeb) would be able to offer. This is one of my favorite Batman stories out there and I also think by comic book standards it can be considered one of the best. The art of course is phenomenal, if you have no prior experience with Jim Lee's art you certainly won't forget it after reading this.<br /><br />The writing is great, but what may be most impressive is the story. In 12 issues this team manages to introduce almost every single major character in Gotham City AND deliver an excellent story with a new villain after which the book is named. If you're a Batman fan and you like graphic novels this is a must read, it's up there with the greatest of all time.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This movie is great! Loved all the actors. My husband and I have watched it several times. Would definately recommend to watch anytime!
B005LHOKFS|4.0|Love it very easy to use especially like the traffic advisor which gives you another way to get where your going, if there is another way.  My only dislike the talking is not clear she really has a serious speech impediment
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|The movie had a quick line that took a jab at adoption. Adopted kid's feelings might be hurt. This was only one line in the movie though.<br /><br />Aside from that, it's your typical superhero movie with excessive violence and the female hero, Black Widow, resorting to exploiting her sexuality to meet her goals.<br /><br />Am I the only one who's tired of women always having to whore themselves in movies in order to be powerful?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like calculator plus. it really helps me with my math homework. I also like to check my mqth homework with this.thanks for this app!
B003KJF2WE|4.0|I was a little leary about watching this.  Not my kind of movie, but really ended up enjoying it.  Great stroy line, and great actors.
B000HF6ZR0|3.0|Most of the suspense really centers around the characters being unable or refusing, to communicate with each other, or to work as a team. Some of that is explained by personality friction, but most of the time there's no good reason and it only serves to create meaningless suspense.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I'll keep it simple because this says it all - I couldn't put it down. If you are interested in the events of 11/22/63, are nostalgic for late 50's to early 60's lifestyles and enjoy time travel stories you're gonna love it.
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|this game is five stars. its just like Mario cart but this game is the best game ever. this is awesome
