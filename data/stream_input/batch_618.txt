0790733226|5.0|This movie is based on Carl Sagan's novel of the same name.  Carl is no longer with us, but he was a key component in the production of this film.  Starring Jodie Foster, Matthew McConaughey, and William Fichtner, this fine film will capture your interest from the start, and even more so if you are into Science Fiction.  You really get caught up in Ellie Arroway's heartfelt desire to make contact with another world.  She gets her chance, and what follows is nothing short of miraculous.  I cried during this movie.  It tugs at your heartstrings in a big way at times.  This is a truly great movie.
0553582453|5.0|In Fool's Errand we were introduced to Ms. Hobb's outstanding ability to surprise us - yet again - when we think we've heard everything there is to know about the world she's created and the characters we've come to love and enjoy. And this book is no different. We are introduced to a considerable amount of \\"new things\\", and \\"possible new things\\". <br /> <br />Dutiful's betrothed is the Narcheska Elliania of the Out Islands - the same Out Islands who peppered the Farseer trilogy with the Red Ship Raiders and created horrors from citizens in the Six Duchies that were dubbed the Forged Ones. The two kingdoms are attempting the typical \\"medieval truce\\", but when the Narcheska arrives with her retinue, it is obvious that their cultures are so considerably dissimilar that any pairing between the two seems unlikely. Not exactly Eleanor of Aquitane and Henry II. <br /> <br />And as always, with everything that Robin Hobbs has written, there is more here than meets the eye. Luckily, our Catalyst, Fitz, is quite adept at his role of \\"royal spy\\", and sees just enough to know something is very wrong. What he sees is fascinating. <br /> <br />Robin Hobb gives us just enough information to intrigue us, but not enough to give anything away. This is not a skill to be undervalued - this is one of the skills that separates good writers from great writers. I would place Ms. Hobb squarely in the latter. <br /> <br />Serving as almost more of a foreground than a background is the need for the prince to learn how to both Skill and use the Wit. Chade demands that Fitz be his tutor, for who else could do both, but Fitz finds himself considerably at odds with the ethics of teaching anyone to use the Skill. Chade does not share these ethical qualms (unsurprisingly), and has designs of his own with the Skill. <br /> <br />While the Out Islanders are at Buckkeep Castle, Bingtown traders arrive unannounced asking for help from the Six Duchies in their seemingly never ending war with the Chalced states. This upsets the Out Ilsanders, but as you get to know them you have to wonder what doesn't. The Bingtown traders bring some startling revelations about the identity of Lord Golden, and Fitz finds himself fitted with yet one more burden as a result. As if he needs more. Robin Hobb spent three books in the Farseer trilogy practically slaughtering him, and she's back at it again. She took Nighteyes from him in Fool's Errand (not a spoiler because it's on the jacket of this book), and now he juggles a relationship with Dutiful, who is his physical son, and other relations of his that come into his life unannounced and certainly unlooked for. If Fitz survives this trilogy intact, it will amaze me. Ms. Hobb has hit Fitz harder than Donaldson hit Thomas Covenant, and that's saying a lot. <br /> <br />But she hasn't done it gratuitously. Her treatment of Fitz, so to speak, has arisen out of his role as the Fool's Catalyst. There was/is no one else suited to bear his burdens by the nature of his existence. <br /> <br />Back to the story... <br /> <br />The Prince is a child. The Narcheska is a child. The Prince spoke out of turn, and the Narcheska believes that he slighted her. Therefore, in her youthful genius, she commands of him a ridiculous and impossible task: to bring her the head of a dragon, and not any dragon (as if there are multitudes), but her people's legendary \\"champion\\". Dutiful foolishly accepts the quest before his mother can put a stop to the nonsense, and as he has given his word, she must go along with his decision. <br /> <br />Now Chade has all of the ammunition he needs to demand that the Prince have a coterie, but what the Prince gets isn't quite what Chade expected. It might be, however, just what he needs. <br /> <br />Robin Hobb fans - enjoy this. It is a feast. <br />

0553582445|5.0|While I admire Robin Hobb's work, it took me quite a while to get into this series. I started it twice, only to put it down within the first twenty or thirty pages. Looking back, I realized that I missed the younger Fitz, the frolicking Fool, and all the trappings of Buck. In essence, when we left Fitz, an almost unimaginable series of events had taken place in his life, and we had become accustomed to a near breakneck pace, with twists, intrigues, romances and brutally painful sacrifice...and now he lives far away from all of that, scarred both emotionally and physically, some fifteen years older, in a shack, hunting with Nighteyes, raising chickens.  It was similar to jumping out of a speedboat into a canoe. I wasn't ready for it.    The third time, I decided to be more patient. I had purchased each book in hardcover when they came out, so I had a reason to want to read these books.    My patience paid off, but wow, did she take a long time to engage the reader (well, this reader) one hundred percent of the time. Publisher's Weekly hints at this in their review, but says readers won't be put off by the slower pace in the beginning. I would guess that some were.    It was, most certainly, necessary to do many of the things she did at exactly the pace she chose, especially in the beginning. She needed to show Fitz as a grown man, and not merely skim over the changes that occurred in his life with a quick telling as many writers would. What she did, most admirably, was show us. While that may have slowed down the pace, we became accustomed to the new, older, more mature Fitz. We grew comfortable with him, even though he was significantly foreign to us.    When the Fool visited him at his shack, I was fairly well glued to the page in surprise. There was more than a suggestion of homoeroticism in the way they responded to each other. We know this isn't coming from Fitz's side, as we watched him grow up and go through a sexual awakening, so it leaves only the Fool to wonder about. Of course, it's easy to read into things that aren't there...    What's more obviously fascinating is that the Fool is no longer in his black and white motley, nor is he the Fool. He is the wealthy Lord Golden, and a stranger sight is difficult to imagine. He is still, however, the White Prophet. But perhaps not the only White Prophet. We get a glimpse of the Fool's younger years - only a glimpse, and hints of things to come.    Ms. Hobb has done something very dangerous here. She's introduced us to two of our favorite characters from the Farseer trilogy, and she's not giving them to us as we remember. The Fool's extended visit, which was part of why the first 150 pages were 150 and not 75, was necessary. That's where we really got to see Fitz for who he was now - Tom Badgerlock - and the Fool as Lord Golden. If she hadn't taken the time to painstakingly reintroduce these characters, we might have been thrown for a loop when Fitz finally decides to return to Buckkeep Castle. (That's not a spoiler - it's on the cover.)    Fitz ends up returning to Buckkeep, and is swept up into everything that he had been trying to stay away from for the past fifteen years. One can hardly blame him. To say he was put through the ringer when he was younger, well, that's about as inadequate of a metaphor that I can imagine. But he can't turn stay away from it any longer, because Prince Dutiful, heir to the Farseer throne, has disappeared. It isn't clear if Dutiful has left of his own will or if he has been kidnapped - or worse - but what is clear is that Fitz's role as the Fool's Catalyst has found him again. His earlier lessons from Chade as assassin and his endowments with both the Wit and the Skill are necessary in looking for Prince Dutiful.    Fitz is most definitely Tom Badgerlock in Buckkeep, as nobody but a very tight circle can know his true identity, and he becomes Lord Golden's servant to allow him \\"access\\" to the court, to Chade, and other necessities in findingout what may have happened to the prince and deciding upon a course of action. Seeing him as the Fool's servant while they are in public is a riot, and Lord Golden's actions and demands are a special treat. Considering that Lord Golden was once the court's jester, and is now the court's favorite \\"personality\\", one might think that it would be difficult to appreciate the Fool in this new role. But Ms. Hobb's marvelous talents as a writer defuse all concerns.    In short, I'm glad I was patient. While the story unfolds a bit too slowly, it's a terrific story. I can't imagine writing something like this with so many interwoven threads in the period of one year. It's a shame that such well crafted, well written and original fantasy like this doesn't sell as well as the swill that continually lands in the New York Times bestseller list.     Unfortunately, that's fairly endemic in fantasy. The writers that sell the most aren't necessarily the best writers. Some of the best selling writers flat-out stink. I suppose that should give hope to people that aren't very good writers, but want to be published. <grin>
B000301YY8|5.0|Emotional, passionate lyrics complimented by a great voice.  Great album, I love it!
B000002OVJ|5.0|Better than the original if only because there is more of it. Young Man Blues has to be one of the great rock covers and beats any Jimi you may want to compare it with (in my view). Fortune Teller is less than I expected (having read much about its role in the Who's development but never having heard it) and the version of A Quick One is not as good as the Kids Are Alright/Rock'n'Roll Circus version (the best rock TV performance ever - except for Iggy doing I;m Bored on Countdown in 1978 maybe). It's Meaty Beaty Big Bouncy and FAST. Love it or it'll kill ya.
0156027321|5.0|This book was absolutely fabulous; not only was the simple story captivating and entertaining, but the message within the story is delightfully thought-provoking.  About halfway through the book I couldn't put it down!  At the beginning, I didn't understand the emphasis on Pi's faith in different religions, and near the end of the voyage I was disappointed the journey ended so quickly, but then the interview with the men at the end brought the message of the story to the forefront and made me rethink the whole novel I read!  It was so refreshing!  Now after taking the book in, I find myself reflecting about the theme of faith and truth in terms of religion, and how it ties into my religious beliefs.  What a great book!
B000E97Y6K|5.0|A great film makes you care for the characters.  An amazing film sticks in your head, you remember lines from it and can't wait to see it again.  Is King Kong an amazing film?  I don't know, BUT I do know that King Kong is a great film.  Jack Black is great as Carl Denham, Adrien Brody is solid, and Naomi Watts steals the show.   <br /> <br />Peter Jackson's direction is fabulous, yes it could have been trimmed a little, BUT I didn't mind that much.   <br /> <br />One of the things I love about this movie is the epicness, absoulute vastness of it all.  You travel through New York, the jungles, and rivers, of Skull Island.  King Kong is a great big adventure movie and I believe there are far too few movies that can capture your imagination and make your eyes tear up, or make you gasp in awe at the shots.  King Kong is an amazing film.  Its the type of movie that doesn't come along often, a film that makes you laugh, smile, cry, and applaud at the end of it, and that, that is what filmmaking is all about....
B0009S2T0M|5.0|This is a real movie.This is what a movie is all about.And at the same time it is a real drama that shows what we humans do to each other.For good or for bad.It does not surprise me that \\"real\\" movie critics don't like this movie.The less talk a movie has,the worse it is to them.In any case,if you have a strong stomach,watch this movie!!!
B000002J6F|5.0|Went about 25 years between listens.  This treasure kind of faded into obscurity not long after release. Would have expected the music to have lost something over the years, but most all of it it sounds as good as before.  Not surprising to see the album reviewed so highly by all. <br />Manassas never got its share of airplay and the album was not so easy to find after the 1970's.  Though I've subscribed to Rhapsody & it's predecessor Streamwaves, the album was not available for play on demand until just recently.  Soon as I was able to hear it again, I immediately bought it.   <br />That's a perfect example of how things really work. Just the opposite of the way the music distributors used to think.
B000G7PMD2|5.0|I'm one of the fortunate 6000 people who attended this show last April.  Having been a DT fan for over 15 years and seeing them live seven or eight times (including the Metropolis show in NYC), I've heard most of their music live.  Although there were a few songs that I would have liked to hear at this show (\\"These Walls\\" especially) this performance was still incredible!  I've always been attracted to symphony arrangements in music (going way back to the early 60's) and the addition of rock music into the fold just makes my day.  So here you have this absolutely amazing group of musicians with this great group of symphony musicians joining them to produce one hell of a great sound.  I was in Heaven!  I could hardly control myself after getting the DVD to relive this experience.  Well, I gotta tell ya, it had me cheering and yelling several times during the performance!  \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" brought tears to my eyes during the show and again after watching the DVD.  I guess there's something to say for music that can generate that type of emotion.  After the conclusion of \\"Octavarian\\" I was in tears again!  Of course I was a little horse from yelling and out of breath from whistling.  All in all it was an exausting concert.  I guess if you leave a show feeling like that, the band performed rather well.  Ya think?  Anyhow, I wopuld highly recommend this cd and dvd for any fan that hasn't seen them this close.  The video coverage is actually quite good.  I can't be a judge of sound quality.  You need to ask someone with a home theater system.  Get it . . . watch it . . . love it!
B00001ZT6Z|3.0|For years I really knocked this album, mainly due to the evil devil lyrics and Tony Martin's singing. Well, about 2 weeks ago I got this on vinyl and gave it a few more listens and decided that it's not as horrible as I thought all these years. I can almost say that I like it and recommend it.<br /><br />The good....I love the album cover and the back cover as well. That's why I am glad to finally own it on vinyl. Secondly and most importantly, some of the music is quite good and Iommi does get in his share of memorable guitar riffs, particularly on the title track, Kill in the Spirit World and Black Moon, this last song being my personal favorite, along with Night Wing. Cozy Powell makes his presence known with some powerful drumming.  Now on to the bad.<br /><br />I still don't like Tony Martin's singing on this or his vocal melodies. It's funny but I actually think that Martin sounds good when singing other people's vocal melodies and lyrics. I just don't think he was good at writing and singing his own melodies. I can't recall how any of his vocal melodies sound and not just on this album but on his other Sabbath albums. He never really had a strong personality as a vocalist, sounding like a bad combo of Dio, Don Dokken and Sammy Hagar. And lyrically he writes too many evil devil lyrics. He mentions the devil or Satan in five of these eight songs. I know, it's a Black Sabbath album and that type of lyric is supposed to fit this band but I think Martin overdoes it here.<br /><br />Still, the album cover, song titles and song lyrics do give this album a very spooky vibe. And Iommi does himself proud here. So, after all these years of hating the album (and I still hate Devil and Daughter), I am now recommending it.
B00004X01U|1.0|I'm a fan of Madonna's and I thought \\"Ray of Light\\" was great, even though it was  a sound I wasn't used to hearing much from her. So here comes the single \\"Music,\\" which was funky and futuristic. After listening to the CD I was so ticked off for wasting my money on it. \\"Music\\" isn't exciting at all. Too many bleeps, very little emotion, too many bizarre and lousy lyrics. The only good tracks are \\"Music\\" and \\"Runaway Lover\\". I held on to this CD for as long as I could because it looked good with my Madonna collection. But eventually it started taking up space and I sold it just to make room for my newer CDs.  Get \\"Ray of Light,\\" \\"Erotica,\\" \\"Bedtime Stories,\\" \\"Like A Prayer,\\" or her self-titled  album. Get any of her earlier music instead of this. You're not missing anything here.
0060589469|5.0|Anyone with moderate intelligence and sufficient leisure can work out their own private philosophy.  The worth of such a philosophy should not be measured by comparison to the great philosophers of the past (or present); rather we should ask how well does it assist its creator in coping with life.  Some personal philosophies are crafted in such a way that they help, not just their creator, but large numbers of their creator's fellow beings.  Thus it is with the personal philosophy of Robert M. Pirsig, who laments that he has not had an original thought in years.<br /><br />\\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" recounts a semi-mythical motorcycle trip from Chicago to California in which Pirsig confronts and defeats his inner demons and repairs his shattered relationship with his eldest son, Chris.  With a past of involuntary hospitalization, a present of recurring nightmares, and a future of anticipated return to commitment, Pirsig rides the roads, introspects, and works on his relationship with his son.<br /><br />Pirsig's former self, whom he calls Phaedrus, went mad attempting to work out the meaning of the abstract concept of quality; his current self totters on the brink of madness attempting to achieve a quality relationship with his son.<br /><br />The book covers thousands of miles of countryside and thousands of years of Western philosophy, from Chicago to California, from the Academy to academia.  Although the word Zen figures prominently in the title, and although Buddha is mentioned more than Socrates, the philosophy partakes far more of the tradition of the \\"Iliad\\" than of the \\"Bhagavad-gita.\\"<br /><br />Pirsig should not despair over his inability to formulate original ideas.  Qoheleth wrote that \\"there is nothing new under the sun,\\" and centuries later Omar Khayyam echoed that thought.  Pirsig's chosen field of rhetoric recognizes man's basic lack of originality.  The first of the five departments of rhetoric is Invention, the devising of arguments.  An alternative name for that department is Discovery.  The rationale for this alternate name is that the rhetorician does not \\"invent\\" arguments, all the arguments already been invented.  The rhetorician simply discovers the best arguments for the case at hand.  The rhetorician's originality is expressed, not in the department of Invention/Discovery, but in the department of Arrangement.  How well are the arguments organized?<br /><br />Pirsig may not have expressed any original ideas in \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\", but he has arranged those ideas in (for the 1970's) a fresh, original way.  The enduring success of the book attests to Pirsig's creative genius.of arguments.  An alternative name for that department is Discovery.

0446677450|1.0|Ok-maybe I shouldn't be writing a review as I did not finishing reading the book.  However, I could not.  That has to be one of the worst books I have read.  I borrowed it (thankfully) and couldn't get more than half way through it.  It is so incredibly bad written.  It takes one idea like say for instance, a house is not an asset.  And then spends an entire chapter saying a house is not an asset.  Thats it.  An entire chapter.  Then, the rich make their money work.  That's why they are rich.  You want to be rich?  Make your money work.  That is how the rich got rich, and the poor are poor.  Because the rich make their money work.   Get the idea???  Absolutely no investment advice, other than the rich make their money work and your house is not an asset.  All this book does is repeat four sentences in 100 different ways.  Makes for one more bad read.
B0000542D2|5.0|I was really in love with this movie. I love the Beatles and their music and have always regretted I was'nt around the first time they played on Ed Sullivan (I am only 26 years old.) <br />  I was floored beyond belief when I saw John Lennon in the film for the first time. He was actually very good-looking, very funny, and had just enough of a dark side peeking through to make him extremely intriguing to watch. (He has now been added to my personal list of sexiest men I have seen. And it is a pretty short list.) <br />   As for the DVD, I can't really comment on anything that has been lost from the original movie, having never seen it. But I know I really, really enjoyed the movie.
B0006Z2LCE|4.0|Donna Summer has a great set of pipes.  I don't think anyone would argue about that.  However, I must say that her singing showed a bit more flair and finesse on her 80's stuff, so I disagree with the reviewer who felt her work from that period was inferior. <br /> <br />The glaring flaw on this collection is the HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE way they butchered \\"No More Tears (Enough is Enough).\\"  The editing is so poorly done on this track that it actually sounds like it's skipping in about 3 different places.  When the attempt was made, apparently, to make the \\"funkier\\" mix from Donna's record company  fit into a 4-minute frame (as opposed to the more mainstream disco mix found on Barbra's), some bad editing resulted. Honestly, the track sounds like it was edited with a blunt meat cleaver.   There were 2 long (album) versions of this song, and the mixes from the artists' respective record companies sounded very different except for the vocal tracks. In my opinion, the mix found on Streisand's \\"Wet\\" album is superior because their voices don't get washed out by those twanging guitars, and the editing is much better.  I'm sure you all know that the short version of the song was edited from the longer and was not specially recorded for the radio market.  This is still a common practice today with club songs. <br /> <br />Other than that, the rest of the sound is extraordinary, in my opinion, and I have picky ears. <br /> <br />If you don't mind having the radio or single tracks as opposed to to the club mixes, buy this.  Even if you already have most of the single mixes, you may want this anyway due to its above-average sound quality.  If you're an avid Summer fan, you'll definitely want this regardless.  If you're looking for a listenable version of \\"No More Tears,\\" you'll find that on the aforementioned Streisand album or one of Summer's other anthologies containing the full version.  Even the radio edit found on Streisand's \\"Memories\\" album is far superior to this one. <br /> <br />Money well spent in any case. <br /> <br />Cheers!
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Like all good parodies, \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" manages to both mock and provide a good example of the genre it's spoofing. Bloody, morbid, and even a bit scary, this film is also so funny you may find yourself laughing at an embarassing volume. Granted, the gallows humor may be too dark for many--a graphic disembowelment may kill the movie for some viewers--but for those who take a secret delight in watching civilization and human relationships get pushed to the brink, this movie will entertain even after multiple viewings. <br /> <br />Oddly enough, the original \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" was a deadpan (har har) satire on American consumerism, and it's fun to see those themes reemerge in a more obviously humorous setting. The opening credits make it clear that zombies are already among us, and they are us. Yet somehow a man who's grown dead to life manages to rise (\\"from his couch,\\" as the trailer proclaims) to grasp onto a few fleeting moments left in the face of worldwide destruction. As a modern fable, we could do worse. <br /> <br />Be sure to watch this movie twice to catch all the background humor. Also, the \\"plot holes\\" fill in the gaps of the more unbelievable scenes with narrated comic strips. A great addition to any film library.
B000FFJ85I|4.0|Ok ok, I'm been guilty of it too- saying I like a bands 'older stuff' and 'they changed so much', calling them sellouts or what not.  However, with time and maturity comes the realization that EVERYONE CHANGES.  Think about where YOU were 10 years ago.  If you had a chance to make music back then versus now it would most likely be extremely different- if not, you are the Pixies and you rule.  In the mean time, give these guys a break, they are doing what they love, and GROWING UP. If you don't like it, well, I here yah bro- but hey, noones perfect, right? ;)
B000059Z8J|3.0|The Donner/Puzo version of Superman is a tough nut to crack. On the one hand, it revitalized a pulp action character that had been floundering for some time, by a big budget and some highly competent film-making. On the other hand, it did so by giving him a gravitas that could best be described as undeserved. During the mid-70s, comic book writer Elliot Maggin slowly formed Superman into a kind of sci-fi, cosmic Christ figure, with all sorts of \\"salvific\\" undertones. When Mario Puzo was assigned to write the script to Superman: The Movie, he talked at length with Maggin and apparently got many of his ideas from the comic writer--including, we can surmise, the messianic ideas that appear in this film. In many ways, this was a stroke of brilliance. The frequent occurrence of Superman \\"saving\\" people from dangerous situations was merged with a Christic atmosphere to produce one of the most popular superhero movies of all time. <br /> <br />Despite the \\"mythos\\" of the first half of the movie, the rest is dragged back down to the pulp level. Superman's Clark Kent alter ego is the nerdish it's ever been, and the supporting characters rarely add anything but a bit of background texture. The Lex Luthor of the film is a bit of a dandy, and his plan to destroy California using nuclear missiles is made even sillier due to his motivation: real estate. It's like imagining Jesus came to save humanity from fart jokes. And, alas, the time travel conceit at the very end destroyed the best emotion in the film, in reaction to Lois's death. (Unfortunately, the 20-years-later sequel \\"Superman Returns\\" copies too many of these mistakes.) <br /> <br />This movie promises much, delivers some, and skimps the bill on the rest. There's no denying that Christopher Reeve delivered a great performance, but I'm inclined to think that he's the only thing that made this movie good. The plot and the characters needed some rethinking before it went into production. Still, it's entertaining and has many ground-breaking effects. If you don't mind some cheap humor thrown in with your mythic heroes, this might just be the movie for you.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Varg Vikernes is on crack......He says that Risk has the best, fastest solos? He is joking? I guess hes never actually listened to Risk. Well, anyways, RIP is a excellent thrash metal album. Definately in the top 5 of all time! The remaster does have new vocals, but thats because the original vocal tracks were missplaced when they were being remastered. So Dave had no choice but to re-rocrd the vocals. I think it still sounds great! I would definately go out and get this CD with no hesitation. Favorite tracks: Holy Wars, Hangar 18, Tornando of Souls.
0618551050|5.0|\\"The Trouble with Physics\\" is a fascinating account of the current state of quantum physics, and why the String theory has led it into a stagnant state for the past 20 years.  Lee Smolin offers some sobering account of the US physics research program.  He calls for some innovative, deep research into the relationship between the quantum system and the geometry of the universe to find a path to the true theory of everything. <br /> <br />I find Smolin's writing style very accessible.  A typical science enthusiast like me had no difficulty digesting the materials inside the book, and I gained some valuable inside look on the state of the modern quantum research program.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|Jack Nicholson's Joker is a performance for the ages - and one to which perhaps more of us should take heed.  Egoistic misanthropy and callous disregard for life have exponentially exploded among our species since the great actor's wild parody of the sins of the \\"Me Generation\\".  To me, the speeches of our nation's political and corporate leaders at times hauntingly echo Nicholson's Joker's now classic harangues - and private corporate armies? Is there really much difference between Blackwater and the \\"Joker's men\\"?<br /><br />In my opinion, this performance is Nicolson's greatest - although there have been many other superb ones - and that is said solely on the basis of the moral statement.  Nuff said. Awesome script. The technics of the film have been justly celebrated and imitated. The soundtrack is my favorite extended effort of Prince.  And it's great to have it in such a technically superior package.  Stands the test of time. To be seen in conjunction with reading the amazing \\"Rise and Fall of the Guber Brothers\\" -if you can find a copy.
B00004TJTS|5.0|I'll be brief.  This movie shows how a dog can become integrated into a family, so much so that the end of the movie it is practically unbearable to watch the final scene.  There will not be a dry eye in the house.  This film is a triumph for all dog lovers.
B000GG4Y32|5.0|'Reds', directed by and starring Warren Beatty has been called his 'Citizen Kane', comparing Beatty in some ways to Orson Welles. I agree with practically all the other major reviewers below in believing 'Reds' is Beatty's best, before or since, but it is nowhere near the quality of 'Citizen Kane', and it has little in common with Orson Welles directing style. In fact, the two directors to which I think Beatty owes the most for this movie are Woody Allen and Robert Altman. The 'witnesses' segments seem to pop out of 'Annie Hall's similar technique. And, the gimmick of having several people talking at once is pure Altman.<br /><br />After all these years, I think this movie has not worn as well as many other Oscar also-rans. The one think for which I most often remember this movie is Jack Nicholson's very underplaid role as Eugene O'Neill. This may be one of the very, very, very few roles where our Jack does not ham it up. I saw this in the theatre when it first came out, and unlike some other movies such as 'Apocalypse Now', it does not improve with age, although it is still a worthy dramatization of places and times which are becoming more and more foreign to us.<br /><br />Worthy, but not great.

0743298020|5.0|I bought this last Friday night then stayed up to finish it at 2am this morning - it was so good. This remarkable first novel from Diane Setterfield lived up to all its hype and delivered beautifully. Set mostly in Yorkshire, The Thirteenth Tale follows a novice biographer's journey to uncover the truth of the world's most beloved author, Vida Winter. Now nearing the end of her life, Miss Winter has sworn to tell the truth about her life (she's given 20 versions of it so far), and only to Margaret Lea, an antiquarian bookseller's daughter whose past holds a great loss. Thick with secrets in an atmosphere reminiscent of The Turn of the Screw, the novel is truly 'unputdownable'.
0345347951|5.0|This book was a very pleasant surprise. At first I picked it up just because I was looking for an easy read. Little did I know it was one of the best sci-fi books I have ever read. It definitely takes a different slant on the end of humanity bringing a whole new meaning of the world ending not,\\"with a bang but with a whimper\\". Childhoods End will take the reader on a journey which explores the human condition and ends in the vastness of space. If one is a true sci fi fan put this on your must read list.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|I'm late kicking in my two cents, but after reading some of the silly commments posted here I had to chime in. I've been a fan of Metheny all along, enjoying some recordings more than others. Even when freshness seemed lacking at times, the brilliant musicianship and melodic gift were always there. Then along comes The Way Up, to me a defining moment in the already remarkable life of the PMG. The length and richness of the longform piece enables the full exploration of ideas and landscapes that is never quite possible in the typical 5-8 minute album cut. It's an absolutely beautiful piece and recording with so many satisfying turns. It's a symphony, PMG style. It is not about being jazz, or rock, or fusion, or folk, or any other restrictive term some people always seem to need to apply to things. It is about pure inspiration performed by masterful musicians. It takes both a mastery of one's tools and art form and a humble awareness of the true origin of all inspiration to discern, record and perform great art such as this. That is what happened here, and there are many of us who are profoundly grateful for the gift the Pat Metheny Group has given us with The Way Up.
1932100660|5.0|I trust the analytical approach used in the book because it is very similar to the one I was taught and then used to good advantage in my management career. And the book's documentation, charts and tables are convincing.  <br /> <br />Having bought into the evidence presented, I pretty much converted to a plant food based diet starting early in 2006. In combination with a calorie controlled (by me) diet, I'm happy to report that I lost 40 pounds since 02/27/06, overall cholesterol dropped by 62, and LDL went down by 60. <br />
B000CBSHK2|5.0|I think this Album is just beautiful. I've only got one other of Beths CD's, and it's a lot more produced sounding (to me) than this one. Maybe that is why Beth is getting such bad reviews here from her long time 'Fans' for this CD?  No matter really...I think Beth and Jim O'Rourke have done a stunning job working together and creating this record.  The production is very simple (at least they make it sound that way) and the sound quality is lovely. the songs are exceptionally well written, and the have kept it mostly acoustic which is nice. Piano/Acoustic guitar/brushes etc, so well played and sound so great together!  I give it 1 million stars.  <br />:)

Can it even be done?  This is the problem plaguing Colin Singleton, recent high school graduate, nearly-former child prodigy, hopeful genius.  Colin, you see, has a significant problem.  He falls in love quite easily, which in and of itself isn't such a bad thing.  The fact that all of his loves, nineteen of them to be exact, have been named Katherine can even be explained away by some form of twisted scientific method.  What can't be explained, though, is why Colin has been dumped by all nineteen of those Katherines.<br /><br />When he's dumped by the love of his life, Katherine XIX, he finds himself in a bad place.  He can no longer call himself a child prodigy, since he's graduated from high school.  He's not a genius, because he's never come up with anything that will change the world.  There's an empty place inside of him where his latest Katherine's love used to live, and he doesn't know what to do with himself.  Until Hassan Harbish (Muslim, but not a terrorist) devises a way to get Colin out of his funk--a road trip.  With no destination in mind, the two set off in The Hearse, Colin's car, and go where the road leads them.<br /><br />Where it leads them is a small town called Gutshot, Tennessee, where Colin gets the urge to see the supposed grave of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.  It's also where the two meet Lindsey Lee Wells and her mother, Hollis.  Not to mention where they get to live in a giant Pepto Bismol-pink house on a hill, interview employees of a factory that makes tampon strings, and eat Monster Thickburgers at the local Hardees.<br /><br />It's also the place where Colin decides to finish the Theorem of Underlying Katherine Predictability.  Assign numerical value to different variables, plot it on a graph, and you'll be able to predict how long a relationship will last--and who will be the dumper, and who will be the dumpee.  Except Colin forgot some pertinent information, like chance, and distorted memories, and the fact that love is never predictable.  As Colin and Hassan learn a few things about life in the small town of Gutshot, we get to follow their journey of learning to grow up, to make a name for yourself, and how to matter as a person.<br /><br />I loved AN ABUNDANCE OF KATHERINES, even more than Mr. Green's previous book, [[ASIN:0142402516 Looking for Alaska]]. That book won the prestigious Michael L. Printz award, and I won't be surprised if this book is nominated, as well.  This story is funny, poignant, and informative.  For example, if I hadn't read AN ABUNDANCE OF KATHERINES I would never have known that:<br /><br />1)  Fetor hepaticus is a symptom of late-stage liver failure where your breath literally smells like a rotting corpse.<br />2)  The junior senator from New Hampshire in 1873 was Bainbridge Wadleigh.<br />3)  There is absolutely no scientific proof that drinking eight glasses of water a day will improve your health.<br />4)  Dingleberries can be anagrammed into see inbred girl; lie breeds grin; leering debris; greed be nil, sir; be idle re. rings; ringside rebel; and residing rebel.<br />5)  Nikola Tesla did a lot for electricity before Thomas Edison came along and stole some of his ideas, and he also loved pigeons.<br />6)  I still suck at math.<br /><br />Order this book today.

0316168815|1.0|Previously, I posted a review of this book. I think the book it is a wretched exercise in overrated drama.  Somehow someone had Amazon pull my review.  Here I am again; the lone negative wolf in a bevy or bravadoes (sic).<br /><br />Essentially a chick book; this misbegotten mess is unoriginal, implausible and downright corny at the end.<br /><br />I heard Peter Jackson is going to try to make a movie of this rag and I am wondering how how he is going to make something from this mess with an ending that should shame any writer.<br /><br />What continues to stymie me is; how could this book have gotten such good reviews from the professionals?
031236198X|5.0|Using prepublication versions of Dr.Kotter's excellent allegory, we have challenged our workshop attendees to read this book in the evening and be prepared to spend the next morning in group exercises focusing on the book, the penguins and their plight as their iceberg is melting.  The characters and their approaches to change are readily applicable as we make a rapid transition from Antarctica to our healthcare organizations.  The participants are engaged, understand Kotter's 8-steps to effective change, and quickly translate the lessons learned to the change efforts we are guiding toward improved teamwork, communication and patient safety. The story engages everyone. People are energized and ready to apply the principles to their healthcare settings with a deeper understanding of the steps, the barriers and success factors. This book is fun, highly effective, profound in its message and usable in nearly any organizational change effort.  Congratulations to Dr. Kotter, his co-author and the illustrator for creating such a valuable, concise and meaningful tool. If we can get doctors, nurses and other healthcare providers to \\"get the message\\" and successfully orchestrate necessary change...you can inspire your organization, too.
B000002KAT|5.0|I have Lester Bangs to thank for turning me on to this album and making me realize its genius.  Actually, I should probably thank Cameron Crowe and Phillip Seymour Hoffman as well, because Crowe's movie \\"Almost Famous\\" (and Hoffman's excellent performance as Bangs) made me want to read something written by the legendary rock critic, so I looked him up online and immediately found his review of \\"Astral Weeks\\" (which, incidentally is a great read).    Though prior to this I had no interest whatever in Van Morrison (whom I knew nothing about, not even realizing that I had already heard a couple of his songs, like \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\" and \\"Domino\\"), Bangs aroused my curiosity and made me want to hear the album so I could see what he saw in it.  So I opened my Rhapsody player, found the album and put it on.  I was immediately struck by the uniqueness of the sound, not to mention the poetry of the lyrics. And slowly, with a quiet insistence, Morrison pulled me into his world, like an impressionist painter who leaves most of the details up to the imagination of the viewer, painting just enough to evoke an impression of having experienced this dreamlike procession of scenes that seem to hover on the edge of reality.    \\"Astral Weeks\\" is to me a sublime culmination of everything that was good about classic rock, folk, and the blues. But this is not the kind of album that you should sample by picking out just one or two songs to listen to.  It is my firm belief that in order to truly be appreciated, this album has to be listened to in its entirety from beginning to end.  Furthermore, I believe that Morrison is trying to communicate something indefinable with this work... something mystical if you will, but not in the overt -- I'm tempted to say gimmicky -- way that most 60s and 70s artists peppered their songs with quasi-mystical references.  Rather, this is an inspired invocation of the mystical as something ineffable that arises from the totality of human experience, and the real genius of Astral Weeks is that it communicates this sense of the mystical not only without ignoring everything that is sorrowful, shabby, painful, or pathetic about life; it often does so by focusing on those very aspects of human existence.    Since first discovering \\"Astral Weeks\\" I have listened to everything by this artist that I could find, but so far I have found nothing equalling the deep, honest soulfulness and haunting beauty of this album.  I have to concur with Lester Bangs when he says that though Morrison was only \\"twenty-two - or twenty-three - years old when he made this record, there are lifetimes behind it.\\"
0307346609|4.0|Max Brooks, son of director Mel and author of the Zombie Survival Guide, wrote this follow-up in the form of a series of interviews with survivors of the Zombie War. Influenced (by Brooks' own admission) by Studs Terkel's legendary \\"Work,\\" there is not a tremendous cohesion in the narrative, but in my opinion about 75-80% of the interviews are good reading form any fan of Romero's zombie world. <br /> <br />I personally would have liked some \\"historical\\" filler narration by the author, to paint a bigger picture of how the world dealt with the zombies. However, my main disappointment is that he makes absolutely no effort to tell you where the zombie virus came from in his undead world. Romero, of course, offered outright proven explanation in \\"Night\\" that a probe from Venus had accidentally brought a spore back which reanimated the dead. Brooks' novel begins with a person describing the first outbreak as already having become world news, but never tells you how (or where...was it African or China, not sure). I guess I just like explanations for my zombie outbreaks! <br /> <br />Some of the narratives are very neat, particularly ones that describe how people flocked, banded or fought together to fight the scourge. The pilot who went down in Louisiana and had to trudge back to I-10 to get picked up, the mercenary bodyguard who hired himself out to a group of bitchy rich survivors in the Hamptons (apparently, though never named, containing Jon Stewart and Paris Hilton), the story of the Battle of Yonkers and the Chinese nuclear sub that became a time capsule of survivors and watched how the face of the planet's oceans became a new warzone, among others, stand out as great zombie stuff. Towards the end, I thumbed over a couple of entries that seemed to be merely the author's interest in military hardware: the Aussie space station satellite workers (way too full of technical satellite jargon), the combat K-9 entry (boring: just read like a military K-9 program how-to) anda couple of the entries that were riddled with imaginary Army hardware terms and exactly how the scopes on new rifles worked seemed a waste to me.  <br /> <br />As far as that ubiquitous zombie aspect: gore. Really none to speak of, short of some blood and some rather ugly decomposed zombies. Don't worry if you're squeamish. <br /> <br />The best part, I think, was Brooks' good handle on current (meaning NOW) world affairs and how they might affect nations' response to an undead apocalypse. He defintely seems (IMO..and I'm in the political prediction field) to have pinned down modern US, Israeli, Russian, Chinese, South African and Mexican foreign and domestic policies. His explanation for why the US was so hard hit and nearly collapsed- the fact that we were so overextended from our terrorism wars and lack of presence of National Guard- seems right on. <br /> <br />Enjoyable zombie fare.
1401308201|5.0|I read the book and saw the Broadway Play recently, so I was dying to get my hands on the Grimmerie.  I was not disappointed.  The photos are fabulous and all the information is even better.  If you want to know all the behind-the-scene tricks of the play, more about the characters in the play, and how it was adapted from the book, then you definately need this book.  My favorite part is the script in the back of the book.  As a teacher, I plan on using the story along with the music to teach my kids about personal strength, friendship, and the consequences of bullying.  I LOVE this book!
B000002BBY|5.0|Having been reading of the `Q music magazine', for some time, there isn't literally a month that goes past without a mention of the Gallagher brothers songs.  And more specially, songs from the first two albums.  (one song was even voted by its readers as \\"Greatest song Ever\\").  So seeing as although I never truly jumped on the British indie/rock explosion in the mid-90's, I did pick up the first two albums many years later, probably more for the sake of feeling like I should own the albums, rather than falling in love with the bands music (as much as I do love their work).  So considering the amount of times I've been meaning to stick on the album, and unwittingly been sidetracked by other albums.   I've recently managed to actually remember to give the album a spin, after having not heard if for quite some time. <br /> <br />It's pretty easy to see why this album garnered such gushing reviews, and remarkable sales, on its initial release, because it has a undiminished energy about it, a certain swagger or complete indifference to anything similarly competing for the listeners attention.  The band are hungry, and have a epic self-aggrandising sound, that perfectly chimed with its release in the U.K., when Britain was starting to produce bands again, that had more than one good album in them, and made for a band, that people (wrongly or rightly) felt reflected the way they were feeling, or at the very least, a Band that understood the term `working-class', and expressed a cocksure arrogance in \\"Roll With it\\".  feelings of introspection, melancholic moods and occasionally not being afraid to rely on someone else with the anthemic ballad \\"Wonderwall\\", or if the listener simply wanted to rock hard with \\"Some might Say\\"....and with the added production and assistance of strings, keyboards, and harmonicas, that lend the sound a fuller arrangement that should the band looking to progress musically.  And when it's at its most exuberant (such as on \\"Don't look back in Anger\\"), it's capacity to mesmerize can be as euphoric as a drug-rush, and as exhilarating as a kiss.  And even some of the songs that are never quite mentioned with the same widespread ubiquity (\\"She's Electric\\", \\"Cast No Shadow\\"), are equally deserving of space on the album.   <br /> <br />Sure....its an album that at times reflects the bands influences (The Beatles, The Stones, The Jam, The Kinks, The Who, The Stone Roses), and feels like the band occasionally pay tribute to these acts, and although it's always nice to hear a band finding their own feet musically.  When you have an example of a unique sounding band like Oasis, who frequently wear their influences on their sleeves.  When it's done so expertly....as is the case here, you simply can't fail to be impressed by the musicianship on show here.  Liam in particular comes across with the swagger and sheer arrogance of a prime-era Mick Jagger.  Dragging words out, and sneering with slight contempt where applicable.  And has the voice that is instantly identifiable as soon as he starts to sing.  Put it this way, when you hear Oasis' songs...there's no mistaking them for another band.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, after this album, subsequent albums would struggle to match the double whammy of the first two albums (although 2005's \\"Don't believe the Truth\\", would suggest that they are making effort to retain some of their initial impact).  But whatever your feelings about their later work, this is a staggering album of some considerable power, and remains one of the greatest albums of the 90's. <br />
0385732554|5.0|Wouldn't it be wonderful to live in a world without pain, divorce, unemployment, or sickness; a world where emotions are eradicated simply by taking a pill and where scientists have decided that a black and white world lacking color would be more orderly? A world where every child is told what his future in society will be on his twelfth birthday. A world where the old are sent to their assigned deaths after a farewell party? A world where flawed infants are simply discarded as though they were trash. A world that follows a schedule, a world lacking in surprises, a world of orderliness and structure where nothing unplanned for exists and where everything is controlled by a pill; in other words, a sterile world. This is a world of perfection, isn't it? Jonas believes that it is so until the day of his twelfth birthday arrives and he is told that his place in society is to be the receiver of memories, a job that only one special person is chosen for. Jonas is soon introduced to the giver, the only man left that has any remembrance of what the real world was like when their was color and pain. Now the memories must be passed on to Jonas, so that they may be kept and held where the rest of society need not be troubled with them, after all why would they want to be burdened with the memories of a time that was not \\"perfect\\". As time progresses Jonas continues to learn from the giver and he begins to long for a world that he never knew, a foreign world with pain and sorrow, love and joy. He soon comes to the conclusion that a world devoid of evil is a world devoid of good. The wheat cannot be separated from the chaff. To remove one will destroy the other. How can he impart this idea to the others in his family and in his community? How can he show them the beauty and the horror that exists now only in memories. Can he alone redeem his wayward world?<br /><br />A magnificent novel that causes the reader to think and draw definitive conclusions. The writing and character development were very well done and the story entertaining and thought provoking. The only detrimental aspect of the novel was the vague ending. After many years I still do not understand what actually occurred in the conclusion. Therefore, this book may be viewed as unfinished. However, the reader may simply wish to put their own conclusion on the end of the story. In summarization, I would recommend this book to children and adults alike; it is something that everyone should read. And, most importantly, my cat approves of this novel and enjoys sleeping on top of this book while I am trying to read it; tis alone makes it worthy.<br /><br />Ravenovadevelopment were very well done and the story entertaining and thought provoking.

B000EUA6DW|5.0|I'll be the first to admit in this review, that I've never Grown-up listening to U.S. Hardcore / Punk bands such as: Minor Threat, Black Flag, Bad Brains, Husker Du, Minutemen, Dead Kennedys, etc..But, what I did have was a healthy interest in Skateboard Videos in my Late-teens/Early Twenties (in fact I Still watch them).  And Via those videos, what initially started with me thinking \\"Why, do they always have to put aggressive skate-punk music, in 90% of these Skate Vids??\\".  But over the years of watching them, I gradually began to  (A) get used to it, and then (B) Actually have a few Tracks that I begun to really like.  Fast forward a few more years, and an appreciation of virtually all genres of music, and U.S. Hardcore / Punk is as important to me, as any other genre of music that I Love.  And although they werent the first, Minor Threat were amongst the most important Bands from the early 80s Hardcore scene, and a scene that was throwing up all kinds of musical possibilities.  Resolutely a fiercely intelligent band, that mixed incisive commentary, with Political and Social observations or damnations.  With a keen eye for summarising the disaffected youths/adults, frustrations with intelligent lyrics, delivered at full pelt, they were a band not to be taken lightly.   And rather strangely for the band, they went against the common staples of the scene, and were resolutely \\"Straight-edged\\", in that they shunned Drinks and Drugs¡Kfor a living considered 'clean living', and it was this train of thought that was proudly worn like a badge of honour by Vocalist \\"Ian Mackaye\\", and his band members.      Although highly influential and seemingly bursting with ideas and thoughts, that on occasions, seemed restricted by their limited avenues to express them.  And the constant re-interpretation of song dynamics and structure, with an admittedly basic band setup, the band only really made a handful of EP¡¦s and one Full length album.  But pretty much all the material that made it for public consumption is neatly compiled here.  The majority of songs are fairly brief (roughly around the 2min mark), and are vocally cathartic, morally outraged, and musically rebellious¡Kwith a very DIY aesthetic to song writing that shunned frivolous instrumentation, and instead delivered tightly wound buzzsaw guitar and pounding drums, all delivered at breakneck speed around Mackaye¡¦s wordplay.  And although the values of Hardcore/Punk were primarily based around volume and confrontation.  Here was a band that was well-read, Heavily politicized, railing against the government, especially the media, and hell??....even against some of the less-than desirable fans that would show up at gigs.  But with Ian Mackaye the band had a singer that summed up emotions, frustration and anger in such a articulate and passionate way, that comments regarding their (by today standards) cheap production and lack of instrumental dynamics, were bypassed by watertight lyrics, a biting sense of self-depreciation humour, declarative statements,  wrapped over snarling riffs around songs such as, I Dont Wanna Hear it,Screaming at a Wall, Look Back and Laugh, Out of Step (With the World), Seeing Red & (I¡¦m not Your) Stepping Stone.     Sadly for most, this band where never truly build to last, and the band would only complete one album, before disbanding and members going on to other bands, or in Mackayes & Jeff Nelson case, go on to run the highly influential \\"Dischord\\" label.  Which would become a haven for similarly tense and intelligently focused D.C. bands that would continue what was started here.  And although the scene has thrown up some truly remarkable bands (see my mention of similar bands, at the beginning of this review), Minor Threat¡Kwere never able to get past the one full album.  But what this utterly brilliant discography does so perfectly is not only put all the bands work, in one nice tidy cd, as well as being remastered, but sequences it so that some of the ever so slighty slower songs (admittedly not many), are skillfully spread out throughout the disk, making every so slight tempo changes from the sheer relentless volatile musical assault.  And for this seminal band, we should be thankful that it: (A) helped kick-start a scene that gave us similarly worthwhile contemporaries (B) The \\"Dischord\\" label, and (C) \\"Fugazi\\"....(*but that¡¦s a whole other story, altogether*)
B000H0MKGK|4.0|I often marvel at how John Mayer's musical career is really shaping up to be the inverse of Eric Clapton's. Clapton arose as a fiery, distorted young guitar god before gravitating to 1990's Unplugged ascendancy and assured, moving pop ballads like \\"Tears In Heaven\\" and \\"Change The World\\". Mayer, by contrast, broke through with the laid-back Room For Squares, sporting acoustic guitars and heart-on-sleeve pillowtalk like \\"Your Body Is A Wonderland\\". Only recently has he begun to show off his considerable lead guitar chops, with jammy appearances alongside legends like Buddy Guy and Herbie Hancock, not to mention the Cream-channeling Try! featuring Mayer in a power trio setting.<br /><br />To be sure, Mayer's never made a secret of his devotion to the Strat-slinging pantheon of Hendrix, Vaughan, and Clapton. A limited-release bonus disc accompanying his debut featured covers of songs by the first two icons. And Clapton is invoked in the liner notes of Mayer's latest: \\"(he) knows I steal from him and he's still cool with it.\\"<br /><br />Continuum, then, finds John Mayer more fully indulging his love of the blues. Consequently, the material moves even further away from the acoustic folk-driven pop songs that made him famous. This album unveils Mayer as a consummate musician, and with him a more dynamic, meatier sound.<br /><br />The good news? His tunes are all the better for it. Despite the sonic update, Mayer's pop-sensible songwriting is thankfully intact, particularly in dazzling tracks like the dramatic \\"In Repair\\" and falsetto-flavored \\"Vultures\\". Continuum also features a reverential take on \\"Bold As Love\\" that'll invariably horrify Hendrix purists. Who cares? It's still damn good.<br /><br />He's also gotten deeper, kids. Mature lyrics take on relevant issues-of-the-day, dispensing with the quippier, relationship-centric sentiments of previous albums--in other words, it's less \\"Daughters\\" and more \\"What's Goin' On\\". Tracks like lead single \\"Waiting On The World To Change\\" and \\"Belief\\" address global/socio-political topics without getting too heavy-handed.<br /><br />All in all, Continuum reveals an artist who continues to improve in all the important aspects of his craft while remaining exciting to listen to. As such, it's highly recommended.global/socio-political topics without getting too heavy-handed.

Although highly influential and seemingly bursting with ideas and thoughts, that on occasions, seemed restricted by their limited avenues to express them.  And the constant re-interpretation of song dynamics and structure, with an admittedly basic band setup, the band only really made a handful of EP¡¦s and one Full length album.  But pretty much all the material that made it for public consumption is neatly compiled here.  The majority of songs are fairly brief (roughly around the 2min mark), and are vocally cathartic, morally outraged, and musically rebellious¡Kwith a very DIY aesthetic to song writing that shunned frivolous instrumentation, and instead delivered tightly wound buzzsaw guitar and pounding drums, all delivered at breakneck speed around Mackayes wordplay.  And although the values of Hardcore/Punk were primarily based around volume and confrontation.  Here was a band that was well-read, Heavily politicized, railing against the government, especially the media, and hell??....even against some of the less-than desirable fans that would show up at gigs.  But with Ian Mackaye the band had a singer that summed up emotions, frustration and anger in such a articulate and passionate way, that comments regarding their (by today standards) cheap production and lack of instrumental dynamics, were bypassed by watertight lyrics, a biting sense of self-depreciation humour, declarative statements,  wrapped over snarling riffs around songs such as, I Dont Wanna Hear it,Screaming at a Wall, Look Back and Laugh, Out of Step (With the World), Seeing Red & (I'm not Your) Stepping Stone.     Sadly for most, this band where never truly build to last, and the band would only complete one album, before disbanding and members going on to other bands, or in Mackayes & Jeff Nelson case, go on to run the highly influential \\"Dischord\\" label.  Which would become a haven for similarly tense and intelligently focused D.C. bands that would continue what was started here.  And although the scene has thrown up some truly remarkable bands (see my mention of similar bands, at the beginning of this review), Minor Threat, were never able to get past the one full album.  But what this utterly brilliant discography does so perfectly is not only put all the bands work, in one nice tidy cd, as well as being remastered, but sequences it so that some ofthe ever so slighty slower songs (admittedly not many), are skillfully spread out throughout the disk, making every so slight tempo changes from the sheer relentless volatile musical assault.  And for this seminal band, we should be thankful that it: (A) helped kick-start a scene that gave us similarly worthwhile contemporaries (B) The \\"Dischord\\" label, and (C) \\"Fugazi\\"....(*but that¡¦s a whole other story, altogether*)
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|The English literature gives us a new adaptation of Jane Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice, starring Keira Knightley and Matthew McFadyen.<br /><br />In the 18th century, the importance to achieve a good marriage was a fundamental pillar for the English society. For women, in particular, it was more than understandable that to live under that kind of pressure and social restrictions was a frustration, especially for the impetuous Elizabeth Bennet.<br /><br />Second among five sisters, Lizzie could be considered the rebel of the family, the Jo March of England, without a neurotic desire to be married for money or to be exposed to the agonizing rituals of traditional courting that was characteristic in that era.<br /><br />But when her matchmaker mother is aware that exists a remote but weak possibility to marry her older daughter Jane (Rosamund Pike) with a quite eligible bachelor (Simon Woods), Elizabeth trips accidentally with her match, the very observer, quiet, shy and taciturn Mr. Darcy (McFadyen).<br /><br />Darcy obviously sees Mrs. Bennet's intentions and driven by a sincere desire of protection keeps his friend from comitting to the lovely and shy Jane, while he and Elizabeth begin a turbulent relation of attraction and rejection, marked for his prejudice and her pride.<br /><br />One of the sharpest observations of Austen's novels is that the rich were used to judge the less prosperous for trying to assure a advantageous marriage, without realizing that they did exactly the same thing. Nowadays, this history of social acceptance, values, misundertandings and prejudices is as valid as it was in past times.<br /><br />The film had the joyous luck of counting with a terrific cast: from the childish sisters of Elizabeth, her shameless mother (a glorious Brenda Blethyn), the prepotent Lady Catherine (a magnificent Judi Dench) and Donald Sutherland as the absent minded and easy-going patriarch Bennet . Clearly, the stars of the history -Knightley and McFadyen- shine above this group. As Lizzie, Knightley is a bubbly mixture of passion, intelligence, defiance and vulnerability. Mr. Darcy, in turn, finds in McFadyen the perfect mixture of modesty, enigm, volatility, tenderness and dettachment, but simply with one look is capable of lettiing us see that his attitude is only a mask.<br /><br />Who is more proud or prejudiced? It's difficult to decide, since Lizzie and Darcy are so alike, and this is why the romance of these two is so provocative. Is clear that Elizabeth and Darcy are made for each other, and even thought neither of them will recognize it at first, theirs' is a soulmates encounter, and their relation is based on mutual respect, admiration, attraction and above all, a clear vision that love is a lot more than what some pretty words can express.ightley is a bubbly mixture of passion, intelligence, defiance and vulnerability.

B000AMJDHY|1.0|Honestly I'm not \\"hating\\" on this album yes I know that it's a 1-star review but I have listened to this album many times and I would like to call this voicing an educated opinion so bear with me through it please.    I can't believe it just when I thought the music world had hit rock bottom with NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys comes Fall Out Boy and then I thought that was as low as they could go but no they came out with this. Panic! At The Disco. If you listen closely to this music you find that the lyrics are completely unoriginal, predictable, and uncreative they take one line and repeat it four times and then grap another line and repeat the process. I've read a couple of other reviews here and a lot of you say that you have memorized the lyrics. No offense but that doesn't seem that hard to do. But on top of that they don't feature any of their instruments. I mean these guys are a band right their is more than just a singer here. This is a sign that they don't really have a lot of talent aside from there lead singer. Who I have to say it sounds just like that of Fall Out Boy's and neither of them have any real talent. I mean they say they have a guitarist or two I don't know. I have to listen really hard to hear him or them and I'm a little deaf in one ear so that is really hard to do. And then some of you say that this isn't MTV inspired because the band was formed by themselves. Have you seen the music videos have you listened to the songs. They don't appeal to the music fan they appeal to themselves and the money-grubbin record producers that gave them a record deal. And their songs appeal to the music video not the music video appeal to the song. You listen to these guys and you say it's nice but its all been done before. Another reason you can tell that this is MTV inspired is that MTV plays the music video a lot that is a aign that they are using MTV to gain publicity and the only reason MTV ever plays something is because they want you to see it so theycan have a lot more control over the pop culture grid. If you listen to the history of music you can hear that over time music just got better and better and better than all of a sudden MTV started and for a while it seemed that good music remained unharmed but over time with the help of rap music and Micheal Jackson the music industry started to decline. And then came the honest to goodness truth MTV made music era with boy bands like NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys. That eventually faded and the money-grubbin record producers realized in order to have the bands last longer they had to play instruments so they have hired bands such as Fall Out Boy, Panic! At The Disco, and Hawthorne Heights and started the emo-pop-punk craze that is today's music. But just like NSYNC, The Backstreet Boys, and all of the other boy bands of the early 2000's you will come to regret buying this CD trust me.    If you really want to hear some good music listen to classic rock bands like Styx, Queen, Foreigner, and all the other great bands that made great music. But if you're not into that try bands like My Chemichal Romance, All- American Rejects, Jet, or Wolfman. Those are some good bands who have remained untainted.

0679745653|4.0|I saw the movie in a theater when it first came out. I was a teenager and, although I believed it to be primarily a girl's movie, I did enjoy it. I've seen it several times since then, and it still has not lost its charm. When I finally did read the book, I was disappointed that the movie didn't follow it more closely. To me, these are two different stories. The Holly in the movie is likeable; the novella's Holly is a harpie who cares for no one or nothing else. (When my wife saw the movie, she remarked that Holly was, \\"an idiot.\\") However, the book's storyline is more interesting...more haunting, and the book's ending is more intriguing. The movie ends as a love story. The book is much more. And, oh yes, whatever you may think of Capote as an individual, the guy was a damn good writer.
B00004RCO8|5.0|In the tradition of the cinematic epics like Kubrick's \\"Spartacus\\" and Mann's \\"Fall of the Roman Empire,\\" Bondarchuk's \\"Waterloo\\" succeeds in depicting Napoleon's desperate and final bid for power and glory.  Steiger, no stranger to roles that have consistently challenged his acting ability, is quite good as the deposed French emperor who narrowly lost his final battle.  Orson Welles' appearance as Louis XVIII, is far too brief but most welcome, and Plummer as Lord Wellington is a casting director's dream. Dino de Laurentiis has produced some questionable if not laughable films in the past \\"King Kong\\" (1976) and \\"Flash Gordon\\" (1980); however, \\"Waterloo\\" must be seen as one of his better efforts.<br /><br />Many critics here at Amazon will applaud the many and well-orchestrated battle scenes--a case-in-point are the great aerial shots of the British \\"squares\\" organized against Marshall Ney (Dan O' Herlihy) and the French cavalry--and one can easily understand the film's strong visual appeal, but this opus succeeds in other ways too.<br /><br />The non-battle scenes, for instance, like the ball before the battle which introduces us to Napoleon's nemesis, Wellington, and the scenes of Napoleon dictating letters to his secretaries, are thoughtful touches that broaden the scope of this highly entertaining film and successfully depict an aristocratically genteel milieu shattered by the cataclysm that is nineteenth-century warfare. On the surface, an era characterized by the gentility of the landed gentry and sportsmanlike conduct on the battlefield, later destroyed by the real brutalities and devastation of war.<br /><br />Unlike too many directors who take liberties with depicting historical events (Oliver Stone's \\"World Trade Center\\" quickly come to mind), Bondarchuck successfully and accurately depicts Napoleon in his decline--plagued with self-doubt, his irascible outbursts towards subordinates compounded by his ill-health (now confirmed by modern bio-historians as a combination of dysuria, piles, dermatitis, and stomach cancer) and his symptoms of grandiose delusion .<br /><br />This is a Region 2 PAL encoded disc, so you will require a multi-region DVD player to view it.

0525476881|4.0|Child prodigy Colin Singleton doesn't feel like he's all that special anymore. In fact, he feels washed up, a waste of good talent, and certainly not a genius. He's a prodigy who can't \\"see\\" anything and doesn't know what's interesting and what isn't. That might be able to account for why he only has one friend in his pathetic world, but it doesn't help explain why he's only ever dated girls named Katherine. 19 of them, to be exact.<br /><br />After K-19 breaks his heart, Colin and his hilarious best friend Hassan hit the highways for a road trip that will hopefully give Colin a new outlook on life. There's something funny about an Arab and a 1/2 Jew driving across the Bible Belt in Satan's Hearse, their affectionate nickname for Hassan's car. But toss in a visit to the grave of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, Colin's obsession with anagrams, Lindsey Lee Wells, and the one thing he hopes will make his life matter--the Theorem of Underlying Katherine Predictability--and you end up with one outlandish story packed with humor, adventure, and self-discovery.<br /><br />With a clever balance of hilarity and humanity, John Green's AN ABUNDANCE OF KATHERINES explores the desire so many people have to want their life to count for something, for it to matter in the grand scheme of things. After all, \\"what's the point of being alive if you don't at least try to do something remarkable?\\" As talented as everyone thinks Colin is, he just wants to make a difference, to be unique and original at least once. The way he sees it, his Theorem is the last chance for him to be remembered and the last chance he'll ever have to fill that nagging hole that is eating him up inside.<br /><br />Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens
B000BKJ6WW|5.0|If you are a hard core Pink Floyd fan, you MUST MUST MUST have this dvd in your collection. Seriously, I've been listening to this album for nearly 35 years, and all of my questions about the 'making of' have finally answered. This dvd contains band member's recollections of the recording sessions of Dark Side, as well as Alan Parson's take on the nearly impossible yet masterful engineering of THE greatest rock and roll album ever created. With indepth interviews from magazine editors, journalists, band members, and production crew, you'll learn so much more than you ever thought possible. I guarantee you will not leave your seat until the credits roll. Even if you're not a tech person, you'll enjoy the way David Gilmour effortlessly demonstrates the sequencers and other sound effects. And if you like philosophy, there's Roger Water's classic moments of personal insight into the making of this album. Nick Mason and Richard Wright's interviews also give you a golden view from inside the studio. And yes, while all of the guys are aging a bit, it's uplifting to see that their memories are as brilliant as the sun- or the dark side? You decide.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|Just finished watching both discs and this lives up to the hype.  The video has been restored nicely and the 5.1 audio sounds great.  The Winterland 1975 show has the best sound out of the 4 full concerts and the bass and drums sound phenomenal.  The 1976 Cobo Hall show has a couple of blackouts in the video; one during Strutter that skips a few seconds of the song.  Overall this is an outstanding release, highly recommended!    I have the 12/20/77 Largo bonus disc and the video is top notch.  The audio is 2.0 and sounds great as well.  With 12 songs and nearly an hour in length it's a great bonus.  Cool that it was Peter's birthday too.    EASTER EGGS    Coventry 1973 - On the disc one main menu press up and the KISS logo lights up. Press enter.    Frehley Wedding - On the disc two main menu press up and the KISS logo lights up.  Press enter.    Enjoy!
B0000028SU|4.0|If you read through the various reviews here you might get the impression that Bruce's \\"Happy\\" album is a lighthearted trip among the fluffy clouds but that wouldn't be accurate.  Springsteen isn't some dreamy-eyed fella sitting peacefully in a garden full of fragrant flowers here, he's a guy emerging from a culvert covered in blood, sweat and tears who is relieved to find the light at the end of a dark tunnel.  His voice is so great on this album, revealing a man who has rediscovered his faith in love.  Overall it doesn't contain the musical power that he pulls out of the E Street Band but his emotion-filled vocals have never been more piercing and effective.  These are terrific songs of triumph and hope and overcoming heartache through introspective perseverance.

0525476881|5.0|Colin Singleton is certain he's a has-been. He got a great deal of attention for being a child prodigy, but now that he has graduated from high school, he despairs of doing anything that matters. Worse, he despairs of ever finding love. For a brainiac, he's been lucky with attracting girls--girls named Katherine. Unfortunately, he just got dumped by his nineteenth Katherine, and his prospects aren't exactly peachy.<br /><br />Colin agrees to go on a summer road trip with his best friend, Hassan Harbish. They find themselves in Gutshot, Tennessee, where the Archduke Franz Ferdinand is said to be buried. There they meet Lindsey Lee Wells, tour guide and paramedic in training.<br /><br />The boys decide to stay in Gutshot for a few weeks while Colin wraps his brain around the problem of Katherines and a possible mathematical theorem to describe the relationship between dumpers and dumpees. Between Colin's brooding, Hassan's adventuresome ways, and Lindsey's quiet friendship, Colin will learn to see things from a different perspective. But will he see the most important things before they're lost?<br /><br />Green creates a situation unique in character and voice in this comedy about a teenaged prodigy on the verge of discovery. There is a fair amount of crude humor and profanity, although it's typical of what most teens hear on a daily basis. This is a novel that will appeal more to teens who are of an intellectual bent--Colin strives to fit in while knowing that he'll always be on a different level than those around him--although it can be enjoyed by any reader with an open mind.<br /><br />In the end, it's a good read. Once Colin gets past his obsessions for math, anagramming, and Katherines, he'll find that even a genius can have a deeply human heart.<br /><br />Reviewed by Christina Wantz Fixemer<br /><br />9/13/2006<br /><br />4½-BOOKS on WUAT; 5-STARS for Amazon

B000F0V0LI|5.0|Okay, let's get it said and out of the way: \\"The Searchers\\" is one of the greatest films ever made. There, it's done. We can move on now. It can be hard to view, and harder still to write about, a film with such reputation for greatness and such a deep background of commentary as John Ford's 1956 classic. The film holds great cultural weight and a completely objective approach to the film is, for most, impossible. It is the most quintessential film of the most quintessential American genre, and its themes and characters take on infinite meaning towards the country and people they represent. It is perhaps the richest western ever produced in both scale and content. And yet \\"The Searchers\\" is really two films in one, and while many like to conveniently ignore its failures, they still fall from the screen cold and lifeless whenever viewed. The film is great because of its challenge to the commonly held notions of history, both cinematic and actual, that have produced it, and yet it still gets caught up in the pitfalls it at other moments so brilliantly rejects. For as much as we would like it to not be, \\"The Searchers\\" is still a studio film of Old Hollywood, and a western to boot, and despite it undisputable greatness, at times in the film this is painfully evident.<br /><br />The first film that \\"The Searchers\\" is, is truly one of the greats of the cinema. It is the story of the hatred, vengeance, obsession, and violence that drives a hard man for five years is search of his niece. It is a gloriously wrought commentary on the attitudes and spirit of the men who founded America and who, as one character laments, need to be dead and buried before any sort of civility can be found. It contains one of the greatest performances ever filmed, with John Wayne as Ethan Edwards, a loner and racist, whose self-destructive drive and bitter hatred give him the means by which to get the job done. Wayne's performance is fierce and exhilarating, and the talent and energy behind it is nothing short of inspired. The other talent at work is John Ford, whose brilliance behind the camera was never so evident as with this film. Ford made Monument Valley the ultimate symbol of the American west, and he displays it here with the respect, awe, and scope is deserves. Many shots are breathtaking, a few worthy of the cold shiver up the spine that only the true masters of film are able to instill. Some are appropriately renowned, such as Wayne's final stance at close, but the majority of the film is near equal in execution. Books could be, and have been, written on the film and still only begin to explain its triumphs.<br /><br />And yet, the other, less discussed film that \\"The Searchers\\" is, is a studio western of the most clich&eacute;d variety and a film that is unable, no matter how ambitiously it tries, to rise above the conventions of the genre. Whether studio pressure can be blamed I couldn't say, but Ford, for all his inventiveness and all his unbound talent, still manages to hoke it up with the best of them. \\"The Searchers\\" is not a completely perfect film, and some of the material used to contrast the tale of Edwards and his obsessive hunt can be painful to watch. In any other film, and indeed in many of Ford's other efforts, scenes such as the fistfight and the love story between Vera Miles and Jeffrey Hunter may hold a certain Old Hollywood charm, but set against the brilliance of the rest of this film they stick out like a sore thumb. They are the sort of scenes that can make you embarrassed to be so in praise of the film when an unknowing roommate casually chuckles at the hokey old Western you're watching. One could take a step back and analyze Ford's negotiations with the conventions of the genre, and reflect on the meaning behind the contrast, but to my eye, when viewed straight on as an unfortunately sizeable portion of the film, these scenes do no more than detract from an otherwise incredible film. Some of them work, sure, such as the breakfast scene earlier in the film, and many scenes with Ward Bond, but just as many others fall flat. Ford had the means to make something truly unique and exhilarating, but unfortunately was unable or unwilling to fully realize his vision.<br /><br />So like so many before me I will give the film five stars, call it a classic, and try to ignore its many failures upon my many future viewings. Watching it this time I considered muting most of the parts where Wayne and Hunter pause their search for a respite with Ford's `characters,' but the film is what it is, and while perhaps these bits should be taken with less seriousness then the rest of the film, they are for better or worse a part of it. I want to justify them and take that step back, declare that these scenes are necessary in order to appreciate the film's true successes. I want to explain that the awkwardness and clich&eacute; of the more stereotypical western scenes is intentionally used to somehow draw attention to notions of legend versus reality. But I have trouble doing so, and instead, as with many other `great' films, choose to forgive its failures and declare it another flawed masterpiece. Two films can be found here, one brilliant, the other embarrassingly trite, but yet \\"The Searchers\\" is a film that has and will forever command respect, analysis, and multiple awestruck viewings.in the film, and many scenes with Ward Bond, but just as many others fall flat.

0307346609|5.0|Not the best zombie book I've ever read, but certainly the most original.  This takes the view I've always wanted a book or movie to take: the global view.  What does a zombie apocalypse look like as a global phenomenon?  How does it develop?  What are the political and military responses?  These were the places where this book went.  Whereas most zombie tales focus on a small group of people and only give glimpses of what's going on in the rest of the world, this one is all about the rest of the world.  Fantastic.  The \\"oral history\\" approach is also very original!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is a really engaging and quite authentic production of Austen's great work. There is less of the frothy romaticising of the time and much more of gritty determination to represent the period and the evidence of class division. Equally, Austen's great wit and simmering sarcasm are brought to life more vividly. I have been given to be a little harsh about the artisitic ability of Keira Knightly in the past, but here she utterly redeems herself and shows a level of talent that is confidant and appealing. She injects into Elizabeth Bennett, the fiesty and forthright nature, out of tune with the requirements of her time, that I believe Austen intended her to have. The relationship between Knightly and Pike (Sisters Elizabeth and Jane) is girlish, affectionate and charming. Brenda Blethyn is perfectly dotty and anxst ridden as Mrs Bennett is intended to be and Donald Sutherland is world weiry whilst dotishly  parental.<br /><br /> The simmering romance is evident and heartfelt and for all that people have long adored Firth's Darcy, Macfadyen injects this awkward and snobbish, cold-fish with a sense of heartbreaking tenderness and vulnerability not before seen; and it is all the better for it.<br /><br />Dench is utterly and obnoxiuosly brilliant and the Grand and Judgemental de Borg. And the sets are magical and actual representations of great English homes of the period. Well worht the effort and thoroughly well done for it's quality of acting, sense of action and pathos and departure from the frothy nostalgia of so many classic novel, film versions.
B00003CXD0|5.0|I guess I've seen this at least five times over the years, but it is always enjoyable. Hoffman is fascinating to watch as he switches from failed male actor to successful female TV star. An excellent supporting cast helps as well, and in fact, all the elements came together for the production team on this project. If you missed it, make a point of remedying that gap in your knowledge of successful movies.
B000E41JUC|3.0|I sort of enjoy this release, and as the other reviewer mentioned it makes for pretty good chilled out background music. I do however feel that Attention Deficit set a benchmark for jam session collections with their self titled album, and that comparatively this release just lacks in overall delivery. There's just not enough going on on this album to get me excited, it's all just too...polite. Porcupine tree is a great band and they are a supremely talented bunch of blokes, but be advised that this is WAY different to what they normally do and should be approached with a very OPEN mind and a large tumbler of your favourite chill-out drink. (or a fat double blader if you're so inclined...)
B00026WU82|5.0|I'm old enough to have been a Dylan fan since his totally folk and protest beginnings, and I did not approve of his switch to electric rock. However, honesty compels me to admit I owned this when it was an LP and played it a great deal. If any of his gazillion rock efforts in the past 40 years are really better than Highway 61, I'd be shocked. A lot of people think \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" is the best Dylan record, but I played that once and gave it away. This one, however, I kept until it wore out. Now, at almost 62 years old, I still play his debut LP, and \\"The Free-wheelin' Bob Dylan\\" and especially \\"The Times They are a Changin'\\" but his rock efforts do not thrill me. I admit that changing to rock and roll was in Bob's best interest---he's back high on the charts with his new album, and the man is older than I am---but I have always missed the young Woody Guthrie disciple. \\"Highway 61\\" gives you the Woody clone electrified, animated and rockin' up a storm.

In particular, this book.<br /><br />Fingersmith takes the tale of two women, one prosperous, one poor, and then weaves a tale of deception and some of the uglier aspects of human nature into it. Divided into three sections, the narrative is told from the view of the two women, each one in first person, which gives it all a very personal, immediate intensity to the story.<br /><br />Susan, or as she is called sometimes, Sue or Sukey, lives in one of London's more notorious slums, the Borough. Outside of the doors of the house on Lant Street, pickpockets, theives and prostitutes work their trade, but within, the oddest of families have formed. While the business -- that of a fence of stolen goods, Mr. Ibbs, is technically the person in charge, everyone knows that it is Mrs. Sucksby who is actually running everything. And as a most modern woman, Mrs. Sucksby has her own profession -- operating a baby 'farm', where foundlings are raised, sort of, with the aid of gin, and either sold or buried, as the case might be. With these three, are three children of sorts -- red haired, slow Dainty, who can unpick monograms and clothing with the greatest of speed, and John Vroom, nasty and vile boy with bloody manners and ugly attitude, and finally, our heroine Sue.<br /><br />Sue doesn't steal, or turn tricks, but rather is Mrs. Sucksby pet. The older woman, sly and quick, has taken a fancy to her, treating her as her adopted daughter, and cossetting her from the worst that Lant Street deals out. Sue has a distant feeling that something is planned for her, but also is content to drift, letting the dubious comforts of her life cocoon her. That is, until Mrs. Sucksby's sometimes lodger shows up.<br /><br />Gentleman, as he is known, is a handsome charmer who manages to make everyone smile with his arrival. Well-dressed, soft-spoken, he is a prince here, and knows it. And when he extends an offer to Sue to come help him in a con with an heiress -- and Sue getting more than 3000 English pounds as her part of the take -- Sue just can't say no.<br /><br />Finally, there is the mark in this tale of deception. Maud Lilly is a delicate heiress, working for her uncle as his secretary as he remains secluded in his library. The work is a vast catalog of books, with mammoth cross references and details, and Maud is kept as a near child, to Sue's eyes, with her hours of writing, and dresses that are more suited to a child than an adult, and her hands always encased in kid gloves. Maud is just as childish as her clothing, and Sue is soon consumed with doubts about what Gentleman is planning to do with Maud -- namely, get her to elope with him, marry him, and then shut Maud up in a madhouse. Maud clings to Sue, and when the relationship becomes very close indeed, the reader is left to wonder if Sue is going to leave her mistress in the none-too-pleasant clutches of Gentleman?<br /><br />Of course, what really happens is a shocker, along with the revelations that come later in the story. It's a grim one, with plenty of doubledealing and mischief, where no one is really who they say they are, and a great deal of turmoil is gone through by both Maud and Sue. The setting is 1860's London, under a perpetual smog of coal smoke and fog, in a land where the sun is seen rarely if at all.<br /><br />One aspect of the book is very disturbing, what with the use of pornography, and the fondness that the Victorians had for it, and the sexual -- and otherwise -- exploitation of children. Yes, most what Waters uses here really did happen, and more often than not, much worse. What is so chilling is that it is all presented rather routinely, which is how the Victorians must have viewed it, and Waters I think did not use it as a shock value. Today, one hopes, such behavior on the part of adults would be punished. So too, is theenviroment of the madhouse described, in ways that would make most of us recoil in horror. Despite all this, the book is nearly impossible to put down, with the story of Sue and Maud giving new twists and turns with each chapter and rising to an ending where justice, if it can be called that, is served.<br /><br />The language here is rich, full of thieves' cant and slang, with plenty of rich descriptions of life in London, and at the remote manor of Briar that is Maud's home. Waters command of the language is subtle and disturbing, and while this isn't for everyone, it is certain to raise a shiver or two along your spine.<br /><br />I just wish now I had not delayed in reading this novel. And I envy you your discovery of this one if you decide to take it on.<br /><br />Highly recommended.enviroment of the madhouse described, in ways that would make most of us recoil in horror.

1400097029|5.0|John Banville's The Sea has had such a profound effect on me that I have decided to write my first Amazon review.  I picked it up out of curiosity, knowing it had won the 2005 Booker Prize and it has lived up to its prize-winning reputation. <br /> <br />I have rarely, if ever, had the pleasure of reading such beautifully constructed prose.  It's almost poetic at times.  The words paint an image, meticulously shaded by simile and metaphor, that haunts the reader, much as the memories of the protagonist haunt him.  And the sea of the title is a presence on every page, whether it is mentioned in the text or not.  At times you can feel the language rolling across its undulating surface.  It's this feeling which propels you on. <br /> <br />I found it to be a moving treatise on loss, grief and the way we deal with it.  At the same time, it offers a glimpse at the way memories can bend and fracture until one can't distinguish between what one remembers and what one thinks one remembers. <br /> <br />The comparisons to Nabokov's style have been made about Banville for quite some time, but I'll add a comparison to Virginia Woolf here, particularly with To the Lighthouse, based on the vivid descriptions, keen observations and strong internal monologue. <br /> <br />I'd recommend it for fans of The Lovely Bones, as well, for the way it shows a character dealing with tragedy and grief.
0393327655|4.0|As expected, Sam Harris's End of Faith is a vitriolic polemic against religion in general, and of Islam in particular. What comes unexpectedly is his virulent frankness about religions' horrors, of which he provides only a sampling. But his overall point is indisputable:<br /><br />  * People act on their beliefs.<br /><br />  * Most of our beliefs conform to the way we perceive the world. Beliefs are our way of ordering of our experience into coherent and intelligible segments.<br /><br />  * Religious beliefs, without any evidence, refutes our ordinary perceptions. It distorts our reality. It thrusts irrational segments onto our worldview that corrupts our otherwise ordinary intuitions.<br /><br />  * Without any basis in fact, religion is an escape (as was Marxism). The solipsistic believer triumphs only in his puny mind.<br /><br />  * The irrational behavior of irrational beliefs that religions provide are unacceptable in every other domain of our human experience, but religion gets a \\"free card\\" to do its dastardly deeds as though religion were divine. It's not divine, it makes no sense, so why are we placating religious zealots who are quite frankly \\"mad\\" in every known pyschologial sense?<br /><br />  * The three monotheistic religions are inherently barbaric (at least according to their \\"Books\\"). Barbarism may have been an evolutionary mechanism for survival, but not in the world we presently inhabit.<br /><br />  * The West has only been marginally more successful in \\"editing\\" those barbaric prescriptions \\"out\\" by virtue of civilization and a deeper understanding through reason and science. But fundamentalisms, aided by relativists, make all the absurd religious claims equally valid and without dispute.<br /><br />  * Radical Islam is not the exception. Islam is inherently radical and inherently bloodthirsty, more so than Judaism and Christianity. The Qu'ran's repeated prescritptions to anihilate the infidel are too obvious and numerous to \\"discount\\" in the present clash of ideologies.<br /><br />  * Religious wars in times past were provenchial affairs. WMD make them now world affairs.<br /><br />  * The Islamic martyr finds justification in suicide-killings, his family reborn, the righteous Israeli settler is his Promised Land (killing those Palestinians), and the Christian millenarianist is in paroxysms of self-satisfaction for the End of Times. What about all this makes evidentiary sense?<br /><br />  * Coddling religion can no longer be tolerated. It must meet the same scrutiny we apply to every other area of life. Produce evidence, or your claims are screwy.<br /><br />Harris's full-throttle assault is brutually unrelenting, and if it has an impact, it will be because of this aggressive stance. And his insistence about religious question-begging, which we do not allow any any other aspect of modern life, can no longer simply be tolerated. The risks are too grave. It's no longer just about Christian Scientists who deprive children medicine, it's no longer about Jehovah's Witness refusing blood transfusions, it's no longer about Jewish claims to be \\"Yahweh's chosen,\\" it's no longer about the Infidel in the Middle East, it's about the irrational behaviors of irrational beliefs that we won't allow in any other aspect of life, that is now threatening our own anihilation.<br /><br />Harris's penultimate chapter is a confusing discourse on ethics and morality, and his final chapter an even odder appeal to \\"look to the East\\" for spirituality, as if self-brainwashing will restore human balance, a sense of the spiritual, and an \\"empirical mysticism.\\" But for all its convolution and lack of coherency, he's arguably looking in the right direction for new resources to fill human needs. As I have suggested, ethics, morality, benevolence, and a sense of \\"awe\\" (transcendence, sacred, immensity) are needed to replace religious archaicisms in order to integrate ourselves in the world as \\"we find it.\\" Perhaps his \\"suggestiveness\\"is all that he intends, but some of his suggestions defy even the most basic sense of ourselves.<br /><br />Stuart Kaufman concludes At Home in the Universe with these thoughts: \\"If science lost us our Western paradise, our place at the center of the world, children of God, with the sun cycling overhead and the birds of the air, the beasts of the field, and the fish of the waters place there for our bounty, if we have been left adrift near the edge of another humdrum galaxy, perhaps it is time to take heartened stock in our situation.<br /><br />\\"The possibility of such collective emergence is heartening. I would rather life be expected in this unfolding since the Big Bang than that life be incredibly improbable in the timespan available. . . . I  am heartended by spontaneous order . . . of regulatory systems . . . order in ontogeny . . . evolution as a marraige of spontaneous order and natural selection . . . expressions of deeper order inherent in all life . . . finding spirituality, awe, and reverence in the unfolding\\" of the inevitable.<br /><br />We are not random happenstances, we are not contraptions piled on contraptions, we are not accidents of extraordinary improbability, we are another part of the enormous expression of the inherent complexity residing in the natural order of the Universe itself.

We simply need to behold how extraordinarily complex everything is, starting with ourselves, and recognize that there are more natural forces operating than we have yet to imagine or caption.<br /><br />Harris and Kaufman both remind us that scientific reductionism is necessary for science to succeed, to get at that particular part that drives the inquiry, but that narrow view of our way of looking at the world scientifically is not the world that we actually see. Let's not lose our sense of the whole: the spontaneity, immensity, complexity, diversity, and order that we are a part of, manifestated in unbelieveable detail within ourselves, and that envelopes every aspect of our being.

B000GG4KTU|5.0|Diana Krall is for real.  Not just another pretty face.  This is one talented woman.  This album is awesome in 2 ways...First an excellent quality recording for us audiophiles mastered by the MASTER himself Doug Sax...Signature Doug Sax...smooth, perfectly balanced in every way.  Second a wonderful performance with again John Clayton doing magic with that standup bass...This guy is the greatest bass player since James Jamerson.  Diana sounds smooth and her delivery is never overblown and overdone.  The piano playing is spot on and things really come together nicely .  First class CD and thank you Diana for the music.
B0001N9ZKW|5.0|Even though it's been in my record collection for many years, I recently listened to it OBSESSIVELY for about a month, every single day.  How many albums can provoke that sort of obsession?  Every single song is a thriller, a masterpiece.  Some songs (particularly Calvary Cross) grew even richer with live-performance development over the years, but that just shows what marvels they were from the start!  Other songs, like \\"The Great Valerio\\" and \\"Poor Beggar Girl\\", appear so richly performed that there's simply no room left for improvement.   <br /> <br />Additionally, the balance of Richard's twanging electric guitar, earthy acoustics and mandolins, Linda's dry unaffected alto, and clean, simple production really add weight.  The whole thing feels quite natural and timeless.  <br /> <br />Timeless.  Yeah, that's the best thing I can say.  Well, that, and it provokes strange obsessions.
B00005JOQS|1.0|In the new Bryan Singer movie, Superman returns after a five-year absence and discovers a world that's changed -- symbolized perhaps most powerfully by a Pulitzer Prize-winning article written by Lois Lane and sporting the title \\"Why the World Doesn't Need a Superman.\\" <br /> <br />And, boy, has she hit the nail on the head. <br /> <br />While the film could have taken a look at the things Superman is powerless to stop, from global warming to civil wars, government corruption to battles for oil and weapons of mass destruction, it instead focuses solely on the Last Son of Krypton's personal pain dealing with a world in which a drab and uninteresting Lois Lane--Kate Bosworth--has a new fiance, a son born out of wedlock, and a pal named Jimmy Olsen who is so useless, he can't even take a good picture. <br /> <br />You will believe a man can fly...and that he can break the sound barrier and do battle with the laws of physics in ways never anticipated or considered in previous superhero flicks.  He WILL amaze you.   <br /> <br />Watching Superman fly into space to listen for trouble is a wondrous moment.  You'll be astounded watching him save both a space shuttle and an airplane. You'll smile gleefully when he takes Lois on her first flight in at least five years as Brandon Routh fills the boots and cape of Christopher Reeve admirably.  As a new, young actor he doesn't have the chops Reeve had, but he may get there by the time a sequel comes around.  <br />  <br />Lois's incessant whininess and bitterness may not solely be the fault of Bosworth, as this is not your mother's Lois Lane -- Margot Kidder's Lois took on armed purse snatchers, punched-out super villainesses from Krypton and was able to leap underneath an elevator in the Eiffel Tower in a single bound.  While today's Lois takes a load of beatings without even smudging her lipstick (perhaps she's got a little Superman in her), she's not the plucky independent woman of yore -- she can't even hail a taxicab on herown.  What kind of city girl is THAT?! <br /> <br />Kevin Spacey's fun Hackmanesque performance as the treacherous Lex Luthor is a clear homage to the 1978 Richard Donner film, and it's not the only one: from static on a radio signaling Superman's return (reminiscent of the static caused by a magical green crystal in \\"Superman: The Movie\\") to a shot of three people trapped behind a glass door (think of the three Kryptonian villains and their oddly shaped prison flying through space); from lines and music cues lifted from that first movie to a small I.D. tag reading \\"Addis Ababa\\" (where Lex first discovered Kryptronite) to the dedication to Christopher and Dana Reeve at the end.  But while homage is great, there is one very important thing this film missed: the joy of Superman.   <br /> <br />This joy is something not overlooked by the people who had brought us \\"Lois & Clark: The Nrew Adventures of Superman,\\" \\"Smallville,\\"--the story of a teenage Clark Kent--and even the syndicated \\"Superboy\\"--the less-sophisticated tights-'n'-cape version of \\"Smallville.\\" <br />  <br />Those other incarnations of Superman have their faults, but the success of each shows what a powerful force Superman is in popular culture.  We have all seen a lot of big blockbuster movies -- terminators and spider-men, guys in bat outfits and stories of famous ships, historical figures, fictional gods, and well-known battles of this world's past -- but none of them, in my experience, elicited the complete and total silence, the utter anticipation, this movie did when the credits began. <br /> <br />The audience was as silent as if they were in prayer. <br /> <br />And they were silent when the movie let out -- wondering why they hadn't prayed for a better script. <br /> <br />I'm going to pinpoint the moment this film loses it's way (don't worry, no spoilers):  Superman performs a host of heroics throughout the city of Metropolis that will leave you breathless and then, just as the movie gets going(despite some hauntingly disturbing moments that will have New Yorkers remembering 9/11), Superman leaves Metropolis to go tackle Lex. <br /> <br />Both Superman and the movie go out to sea. Until this turn of events, the movie was bordering on Magical. <br /> <br />When all is said and done, you don't even get The Moment -- that big moment when you want to cheer as Superman defeats the bad guy. It simply isn't there, because he never does. <br /> <br />The film merely gets dark and it gets mean. It becomes grim and perilous, and all for no reason, with no real consequence. As, if you're going to venture into true anger and hatred and death and darkness...in the end, someone had better have learned something about themselves and/or the world. <br /> <br />And nobody does. <br /> <br />The needless grim and peril is in part accomplished by putting the life of a young child in danger.  Sure, some fantastic contemporary films have put children in peril, but they've succeeded because of their ability to do so with a sense of fun (\\"Spy Kids\\") or a sense of realism (\\"Stand By Me\\"); when it's done wrong, it's unforgivable (\\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\\" [which, personally, I loved]; \\"Dennis the Menace\\").  There is nothing \\"super\\" about a child almost dying just minutes after watching his mom barely escape from a beating that put her in mortal danger -- even when there is a \\"Super\\" payoff. <br /> <br />And Superman the new movie never quite crawls out of the mire after that. <br /> <br />Our hero performs one more super-feat once the boy doesn't quite die, but there are no stand-up-and-cheer moments like those that Richard Donner gave us.  Where was the \\"You've got me?  Who's got you?\\" as Reeve's Superman saves both Lois Lane and a crowd on the street from a falling helicopter?  You'll find no shock and awe as when the '70s Superman burrows to the Earth's core and fixes the California fault line, and then turns the world back to save Lois Lane (whether you bought it or not). And you don't get to enjoy any real sense that Luthor's received his comeuppance (his punishment is not brought about by the Man of Steel, and is paltry at best). <br /> <br />And then the movie ends, after a long and dreary denouement where characters go back to their lives and nothing terribly new or interesting happens -- although you think it's going to.   <br /> <br />While there are questions, such as why it took Lois five bitter years to write her Pulitzer Prize-winning article, or what Clark Kent's excuse is for being gone for so long from The Daily Planet--of which its office and characters are relegated to virtual non-entities--the biggest one remains unanswered by Lois Lane as she tries to come to terms with a world where Superman has returned.  Her new article puts forth the question of \\"Why the World Still Needs Superman\\"...but she lacks inspiration and produces nothing but a tear and a blank page. <br /> <br />Perhaps she can be inspired to work on the next script -- no one seemed terribly inspired to work on this one.  The \\"complex\\" problems of Superman come off like teenagers trying really hard to be \\"deep.\\"  If you see it, leave just after Superman saves The Daily Planet globe from a fall and save yourself from the depressing ending.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|So, I really liked \\"Brave New World\\", but \\"Dance of Death\\" I could never really get into.  Some of it was ok, but it just sounded like weak rehash of \\"Brave New World\\".  This album, however, was a huge comeback.  It sounds like...well, rehash of BNW, but it definitely isn't weak.  They come back with focused, energized songwriting, great guitar melodies, and a nice and big sound.  I think my favorite is probably \\"Brighter Than A Thousand Suns\\", but in my opinion there's not a bad song on here.  \\"Lord of Light\\" and \\"These Colours Don't Run\\" probably sound really cheesy going by the titles, but they're actually really good, especially the latter with its great dynamics and buildup.    Well, I am impressed.  Great buy if you like Maiden.  (New Blind Guardian is even better, though.)
B000GPI2EK|3.0|I'm reposting this because my first review seems to have disappeared. <br /> <br />Everyone interested in hard music should check out Mastodon -- Leviathan is one of my favorite albums of recent years. It's an encyclopedia of great heavy riffs, with enough twists and turns to keep you on your toes (cool time-signature changes, sudden breakdowns into monstrous heaviness). Unbelievable stuff (that does, however, require a few listens to grasp.) <br /> <br />The sound is huge on Blood Mountain, too -- there are some fantastic riffs and breakdowns, and these guys are hugely talented. But I find it weirdly disappointing in some ways. (Although we're talking VERY high standards here -- they're still the most interesting metal band, and one of the most interesting bands period.) For example, nothing quite comes together on \\"Blood Mountain\\" in the titanic way that \\"Blood and Thunder\\" or \\"Iron Tusk\\" do.  <br /> <br />I have some qualms about the big shift towards a King Crimson-y sound during stretches of the album (the opening riff in \\"Bladecatcher,\\" and the main riff in \\"Siberian Divide,\\" and much of \\"Capillarian Crest\\" are basically Crimson on steroids. Brent Hinds is open about his newfound fascination with King Crimson.) I think several songs would benefit from being tighter, and the album is overlong. <br /> <br />But my main complain is the lyrics. \\"Remission\\" had lyrics so vague they didn't matter -- they just set a tone. \\"Leviathan\\" matched sublime sounds with huge topics -- Moby Dick, Norse myths, volcanoes, underwater monsters -- in a smart, literate way. In contrast, \\"Blood Mountain\\" is full of ogres, dwarves, tree-men, cyclopses, flying dinosaurs -- and the effect, for me anyway, is somewhere between cheesy and \\"eh.\\" I think you'd have to be on drugs to find this stuff awesome. (And judging from some videos on their web site, I suspect the band was high when they wrote some of the lyrics--which may be the problem.) ... I've been able to suspend my disbelief to find \\"Crystal Skull\\" awesome, but it takes some effort, and the mediocre faux-mythological stuff really hurts the album.
038551123X|4.0|How can you root for a serial killer?  How can you like a total monster?  O.K. I have to admit Hannibal Lecter was able to get me to root for him a time or two, but Dexter is the most distrubing hero I have ever read about.  Kudos to Jeff Lindsay for creating such a fascinating character.  I plan to read any subsequent Dexter novels that he writes, but he may be on hiatus after the publication of book number 2.  I would think the Showtime series based on the character is going to occupy all of Mr. Lindsay's creativity for awhile.  I am looking forward to the show.<br /><br />This book merits 5 stars for originality.  It truly is unique in its' character development.  I must say I did see the plot \\"twist\\" from a mile away, or at least 100 pages before I was probably supposed to see it, but that really did not ruin the book for me.<br /><br />So why don't I give the book 5 stars?  Because anyone who would give 5 stars to a book that glorifies the antics of a monster like Dexter would have to be a pretty sick individual and I am not.  Really I'm not.....  Maybe I should give my shrink a call.
0671015206|5.0|I read this book many, many years ago on a very long flight.  I couldn't put it down.  The philosophy is simple; live frugally, save/invest money every month, and you too can be a millionaire.  It's great advice, especially in this day and age when the younger generation wants the big house, expensive car, and everything else right NOW, with no regard to the future.  Although some of the info is dated (Enron being named as a great company to invest), and some other advice (putting new soles on old shoes) is a bit much, the general message makes plenty of sense.
B00005JMAH|5.0|This is by far my favorite Harry Potter film. We all know Alfonso Cuarón is an awesome director, and here he shows it. <br /> <br />First, I will comment on some of the other reviews. It seems that the puritan fans of the series (the books), don't appreciate the fact that Cuarón took some liberties with his adaptation. I strongly disagree. First, given the fact that films and literature are very different forms of art and communication, in order to make a story interesting and fun, you just can't narrate them in the same way. Talking about subplots being trimmed, that is just out of pure necessity, but I'm convinced they made very good choices.  <br /> <br />Plus, it's exactly this liberties, exploited to the best, that makes this film so enjoyable. To this, the time line is adapted quite freely, and the way time regression is handled is just splendid (I dare say, more interesting than in the book). <br /> <br />All characters are getting more complex (they were fairly two dimensional in Philosopher's Stone), the cinematography is simpli beautiful, and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black fits perfectly. <br /> <br />Funny thing, being this chapter my favorite, and the only one where Voldemort doesn't make an appearance. <br /> <br />One last thing. I you haven't read the book, and you plan to, this is a very rare case where it may be advisable to watch the film first, since the surprises are, in my opinion, more shocking here, but that may be to each taste (bad thing, once you do one, you ruin a little the other).
0823016714|5.0|I bought the other facial expression book years ago and it was good and this one is just as good.

B0000DYJM6|5.0|The fact that these songs weren't considered good enough for any Pearl Jams studio albums says something about how good this band is. This album is a classic in its own right - even if they are just B-sides, any other band would be pleased to release a Greatest Hits album as good as this.<br />From 'Wash' and \\"Dirty Frank' from the Ten era to the more recent 'Down' and 'Undone' from Riot Act, all the Pearl Jam songs that you may or may not have missed over the years are here.<br />You remember them...Yellow Ledbetter, Footsteps, Alone, Last Kiss, Leavin Here, Hard To Imagine, they're all here....<br />Some of my favourite PJ tracks of all time are on here. Special mention must go to 'Hold On', 'Let Me Sleep', the instrumental 'Brother' and 'Strangest Tribe' which reminds me of 'The Doors - Indian Summer'.<br />Also listen out for the hidden track at the end of disc 2, which is Eddie's ode to the late Layne Staley of Alice In Chains.
B000002LK1|5.0|but I don't think it lessens the value of this recording.<br /><br />I bought this on audio cassette when it was first released due to seeing the video on MTV for \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" and I was not disappointed in the least.  I came to like \\"Personal Jesus\\" and \\"Policy of Truth\\" as well.<br /><br />I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a die-hard Depeche Mode fan but \\"Violator\\" whetted my appetite for more in-depth recordings from the group.  I can't wait to get my hands on them.<br /><br />In the meantime, it's a pleasure to have this back in my collection after so many years.  It's refreshing to listen to *music* and not glorified sampling featuring recycled lyrics.  - Donna Di Giacomo

B00006JIA4|5.0|The Platinum Collection is a repackaging of their 90's compilations Greatest Hits 1 & 2 that were issued by Hollywood Records with the addition of a third disc of additional Queen tracks, some solo Freddie Mercury tracks and a few good/bad cover versions of tracks from a few different artists like Elton John, George Michael and Wyclef from the Fugees.<br /><br />The cool thing though about this re-release of this new collection is that these are actually newly remastered (circa 2001) versions of the tracks and they are even punchier and clearer than the 1991 masters used in the previous \\"gold\\" cover of hits 1 & 2.<br /><br />For one thing, you don't have to crank them quite as loud as you did the other collection and like I have already mentioned, the songs are crystal clear.<br /><br />Basically, Disc 1 covers the years from 1974 to 1980 (nothing was included from their debut 1973 album however) while Disc 2 covers 1982 to 1991.  Disc 3 compiles some singles from their 1995 release of posthumous Freddie Mercury material entitled Made in Heaven that the surviving 3 members completed along with some additional tracks their 80's/90's albums as well.<br /><br />My main complaint is that Disc 1 is only 58 minutes long and it contains the radio edit of Fat Bottomed Girls. With the  reamining space, they could have/should have included other classic Queen tracks like Tie Your Mother Down and some other amazing album cuts that while not released as singles are fan favorites.<br /><br />Disc 2 comes close to being 77 minutes in length.  My only other beef is that they included the single edit of One Vision on Disc Two instead of the album version. I don't know what made them do that when they had plenty of room to put the album cut.<br /><br />Disc 3 should have been all Queen and Freddie Mercury solo stuff and not included any of the cover versions of tracks as some are great and some are awful, but calling disc 3 Queen Greatest Hits III is kind of deceptive advertising when it's not all stuff actually by Queen on it.<br /><br />One thing I found is that you can actually fit some of the remaining choice queen cuts off of Disc 3 onto the end of Disc 1 via burning on a computer/CD burner which is what I did for my traveling copies I keep in my car.<br /><br />For someone just starting to get into Queen, even with the sometimes problematic Disc 3, this is a great buy for people wanting to get something that covers their entire career.  People just wanting the hits will get all they want as well with buying this.<br /><br />Then, people wanting to go deeper can then go and track down the studio albums to dig deeper if they like what they hear.  In that case, people should try to track down the 2001 Japanese remasters which sound better than the 1991 Hollywood Records reissues/remasters.advertising when it's not all stuff actually by Queen on it. <br /> <br />One thing I found is that you can actually fit some of the remaining choice queen cuts off of Disc 3 onto the end of Disc 1 via burning on a computer/CD burner which is what I did for my traveling copies I keep in my car. <br /> <br />For someone just starting to get into Queen, even with the sometimes problematic Disc 3, this is a great buy for people wanting to get something that covers their entire career.

B0002X314C|5.0|John Legend's \\"Get Lifted\\" is the one CD I would listen to above all others (sorry, Madonna... it's a close call). And the new single, \\"Save Room,\\" I just fell head over heels for. Something in my chest tightens when I listen to it. His voice is even smoother and sexier. I love the mellowness of his sound and a beat throughout it. Unlike what you see a lot in R&B, he wouldn't \\"whine\\", he doesn't get carried away singing. His voice is very well controlled, he sings like a professional, not just to show off that he can.<br /><br />From \\"Get Lifted\\", my favorite songs are the first several on the album, the ones that have a beat.

B000DWMYQ8|4.0|Chicken Little (voiced by Zach Braff) is runt who falls into the category of unpopular people.  Unfortunately, Chicken Little compounds his problems by claiming the sky is falling on him without any proof.  Worse, it appears that an acorn may have fallen on Chicken Little's head.  Even Chicken Little's friends Runt of the Litter (voiced by Steve Zahn), Abby Mallard (voiced by Joan Cusack), and Fish Out of Water (with the cleverly bubbled voice of Dan Molina) struggle to deal with Chicken Little.<br /><br />For a long time the town refuses to forget Chicken Little and his crazy idea that the sky is falling.  But through an accident, Chicken Little becomes the town hero and suddenly the whole sky is falling incident is forgotten; until it happens again.<br /><br />Suddenly a cutesy movie about childhood angst turns into \\"War of the Worlds,\\" with less violence.  How can the Earth be saved from the alien invasion?  I guess those people in town are no longer laughing at Chicken Little's assertion that the sky is falling.  Maybe next time they will listen; probably not.<br /><br />This movie is a cute little film with creative and clever animation.  There are some places in this movie where this movie makes me recall the wonderful Bugs Bunny cartoons of the early 60's.  I liked this movie.  This movie is a relatively minor effort for Disney, but it is fun to watch and I would definitely watch it again.  I know this movie has received a number of negative reviews, but the reviews provide me with insufficient explanation of why the reviewers dislike this movie.<br /><br />This movie is generally family friendly with the exception of the youngest members of the family.  Some images in this film may frighten members of the family ages 3 or 4 and below.<br /><br />Disney is unable to create an instant classic each time it releases a movie.  This movie is quite far from being a classic.  However, it is an enjoyable film that I found entertaining.  I think fans of classic cartoons might find this film enjoyable.  Given the range of reviews, you may wish to rent this one before buying.<br /><br />Good luck!sic cartoons might find this film enjoyable.

B00081U6EG|3.0|First of all, there was absolutely no reason for Ronnie Wood to be there. His Ooh La La was awful. Albert Lee and Gary Moore stole the show. Albert Lee was incredible on  COUNTRY BOY and Gary Moore was the same on RED HOUSE. They should have done more songs. David Gilmore was David Gilmore, BORING AS USUAL. Joe Walsh was pretty good and I couldn't figure why Brian May was there. He's not excactly a Strat guy and he's a hog. When Garry Moore, Albert Lee and Joe Walsh are on stage, there is no reason for Brian May to play. He's good but not that good.  They could have picked a better song to end with. What about the great Strat players like Clapton, Blackmore, Beck even that new guy Henry Garza. Overall, alot of mediocre stuff but Gary Moore and Albert Lee save an otherwise boring show. It is well worth the price to see those 2 do their thing.
B000000H6D|5.0|I bought this album as soon as I first saw the song black number one on MTV, and have almost played my original cassette to death. The video was just plain entertaining, childishly \\"scary\\", and I hope they were not taking themselves as seriously \\"evil\\".  It was goth, and metal at the same time, yet poking a bit fun at goth by going over the top.  This album is Dark at times, fast thrash like at others, and then just plain funny at other times.  Where else can you strech a song like summer breeze into a huge epic of a song.  This has the classic songs Christian Woman, and Black NO 1.  Also blood and fire is a great tune too.  It is a shame they re-mastered and took off kill all the white people and we hate everyone on the re-masters, cause those were just brutal and funny songs.  I one both versions now, like them both.  Be happy with either, but the first version is actually better.  Pick it up, you will like it.
B0000024JA|5.0|Classic I love every song. Meth has never really been the same since this album, but I do think Tical 2 was a classic also. This album is dark and grimy. The baseline for Biscuits will definitely rattle your trunk. Tical is ok. Bring The Pain doesnt need any comment. What The Blood Clot is classic. Meth vs Chef one of my favs I think Meth blew Chef away on that one. Other classics are Release Yo' Delf and to me Stimulation. I wished Meth still made albums like this but that was a different time back then for hip hop.  Oh yeah I forgot the biggest hit All I Need is on here but if you want the remixes with Mary J Blige they sell that separately for about 4 bucks.
1570627215|4.0|This novel is an excellent choice for teaching multicultural literature. First, it is an allegory, and it will help students understand symbolism. The symbolism is strong and the lessons it teaches are universal: Life can't be lived well in the extremes. Siddhartha finds happiness when he realizes it. Extreme conformity to societal expectations, extreme asceticism, and extreme hedonism all leave him searching for more. Likewise, when he tries raising his son, he learns that all young people have to go out and find out for themselves, and the cycle continues. Teenagers can relate to the message, because they want to be allowed to live their own lives. Beyond that the book is also fairly short compared to some other novels. Teenagers also appreciate that, too.<br /><br />This one is not the best book ever written, but it provides some good examples of literary devices for students studying literature. Likewise, many students don't know much or anything about Hindu and Buddhism, and this text can hep them understand a little bit of that, too.

B000H7JD4K|5.0|When Bruce and Adrien rejoined Iron Maiden,  I had EXTREMELY high hopes. <br />\\"Brave new World\\" came out, and, while it was one of my favorite releases in 2000,  it didn't compare to Killers, The Number of the Beast, or Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.  In 2003 They released \\"Dance of Death\\" and I listened to it with glee.  It was overall a great album,  but again, it didn't compare to their days of old. <br /> <br />A while ago I pre-ordered \\"A Matter of Life and Death.\\" <br />I had set my expectations a bit lowwer after the last two releases. <br /> <br />Upon first listen, I was into it,  but not completely blown away.  The album isn't particularly \\"easy listening\\" however,  it really grew on me.  I have listened to the entire album about 30 times now,  and I must say, this album gets better with every listen.  Every track is superb.  \\"For the Greater Good of God\\" is probably my favorite track on this Album, and for that matter,  probably my favorite song since Opeth wrote \\"A Fair Judgement.\\" <br /> <br />A Matter of Life and Death is absolutely without a doubt, the best Album I've heard since Opeth released Blackwater Park, and the best Maiden album in at least 20 years. <br /> <br />I usually stick to death or grind,  however,  I just can not put this CD down.  I listen to it in the car driving to and from work.  I listen to it at work.  I listen to it when I'm at home.   <br /> <br />This album is an instant classic as far as I'm concerned, and I hope Iron Maiden keeps up the awesome work for many years to come. <br /> <br />UP THE IRONS!
0393327655|5.0|In the deepest sense this is about the efficacy of the scientific method over other ways of &#34;knowing.&#34;  It is evidence rather than authority that we should look to when coming to conclusions about what is right or wrong, or what we should do in any given situation.  Simply put, &#34;faith-based&#34; is &#34;ignorance-based.&#34;<br /><br />If you are thinking, Science doesn't have answers to ethical questions, or science can't tell us what is right or wrong morally speaking, think again.  Better yet, read this book.  What philosopher and neuroscientist Sam Harris does so amazingly well in this remarkable and very readable tour de force is demonstrate beyond a shadow of a doubt that science--reason methodically applied to evidence--is a better way of determining right and wrong even in strictly moral questions than religion could ever be.<br /><br />Part of Harris's position is that the God of Abraham, that &#34;informs&#34; the three great religions of the Middle East, Christianity, Islam and Judaism, is not only a hideous monster of vile human invention, but the central problem in the world today.  In the chapter, &#34;The Problem with Islam&#34; Harris quotes extensively from the Koran demonstrating that it is not just militant or extremist Islamic ideas that led to the mass murders of 9/11 but that such ideas are at the very core of Islamic thought.  The God of Islam, like his Christian counterpart, is a god of fire and brimstone, who would torture his creatures for all eternity should they misbehave.  This is a God that is &#34;mighty and capable of revenge&#34; who casts unbelievers into hell fire without the slightest qualm, and in fact seems to enjoy the carnage, as this quote from the Koran attests: &#34;Those that deny Our revelation We will burn in fire.  No sooner will their skins be consumed than We shall give them other skins, so that they may truly taste the scourge.  God is mighty and wise. (4:55-56)&#34; (p. 120)<br /><br />That such a &#34;god&#34; could actually exist is fantastic in the extreme.  Clearly such a god is the vision of a very sick mind--that is to say, the very ordinary mind of human beings still mired in tribalism.<br /><br />Harris asks, &#34;How does the mullah know that the Koran is the verbatim word of God?  The only answer to be given in any language that does not make a mockery of the word 'know' is--HE DOESN'T.&#34; (p. 67)  I would add that if there were such a thing as an all-powerful personal God, he would certainly have the ability to communicate in any number of direct ways without diluting or confusing his message (such as inspiring it to be written on ancient parchment to be interpreted by clerics).  Such a God could appear simultaneously before us and say unequivocally what he wants to say.  For such a God, the megalomaniacal game of &#34;I put it in a book many centuries ago and now you either believe it or I consign you to the flames (unless you beg my forgiveness)&#34; would seem a macabre absurdity.<br /><br />Harris is especially eloquent and incisive in his denunciation of Islamic terrorism and the idea that suicide bombers might be rewarded by having their way with virgins in paradise.  (By the way, what do female suicide bombers get?)  He writes, &#34;the most sexually repressive people found in the world today--people who are stirred to a killing rage by reruns of 'Baywatch'--are lured to martyrdom by a conception of paradise that resembles nothing so much as an al fresco bordello.&#34;  He adds &#34;we should observe just how deeply implausible the Koranic paradise is.  For a seventh-century prophet to say that paradise is a garden, complete with rivers of milk and honey, is rather like a twenty-first-century prophet's saying that it is a gleaming city where every soul drives a new Lexus...such pronouncements suggest nothing at all about the afterlife and much indeed about the limits of the human imagination.&#34; (pp. 127-128)<br /><br />What Harris doesn't explain is why we would rather believe than know, why we follow authority in matters of the utmost concern instead of following the evidence.  Here's the answer: we believe things that cannot be disproven simply because they cannot be disproven.  It they could be disproven, we would have trouble believing them.  And we follow authority because it is in our nature to do so.  To some very large extent we are herd animals domesticated.<br /><br />Like other readers I did not find the chapter on consciousness convincing.  Harris suddenly appears as a mysterian as he tries to demonstrate the possibility that consciousness is something more than the workings of the brain.  However, he doesn't say what that something more might be.  I was surprised to read this somewhat faith-based opinion following a couple hundred pages of evidence-based discourse.<br /><br />Also, for some reason Harris does not state directly that the self is an illusion, possibly because that idea is a basic tenet of Buddhism and he is sensitive to the charge, as he reveals in the Afterword, that his book is &#34;a stalking horse for Buddhism.&#34;<br /><br />His point, though, is to make a distinction between the Abrahamic religions of the Middle East and the nondualistic, empirical mysticism of the East.  This is a useful and important distinction.  However I wish Harris had saved the material on consciousness, meditation and Eastern philosophy for another book after more fully thinking about what he wants to say.<br /><br />Regardless of these quibbles, The End of Faith is an outstanding achievement.  Harris writes with the kind of clarity, candor and incisive lack of cant seldom seen in print.  In this regard I am reminded of David Hume, Bertrand Russell, Marvin Harris, Edward O. Wilson, Jared Diamond and a few others who were not afraid to go where reason and evidence led regardless of what might be politically correct.authority in matters of the utmost concern instead of following the evidence.

B000HT3P7E|5.0|I think this show has a lot of potential to be a really good show. The cast is funny and endearing and the premise is fun.<br /><br />I missed the pilot and first few episodes. Finally I caught episode 5 (I think) and thought it was pretty funny. I think it has the potential to be great! Every character in the CBS show (5 in total) are likable but I must give extra kudos to the characters played by Alyson Hannigan (Lily), and Neil Patrick Harris (Barney). I may be biased towards my liking of Alyson Hannigan's Lily (due to her previous roles: American Pie Series, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer) but she brings a charm and charismatic flair to the show. Also Neil Patrick Harris' Barney is GREAT!!! He basically plays a creep which I'm sure everyone is familiar with (because I know I sure am!). I find Barney hilarious!!! He IS that creepy guy at the club but that's what makes him lovable.<br /><br />All in all this show has potential! As long as the stories, acting and writing keep up then I am definitely going to tune in! I think once people start getting to know the characters better, they'll start tuning in as well. Everyone always compares this show to \\"Friends\\" which didn't really get popular until after the first season. Hopefully, this show will continue to be funny and exceed our expectations.<br /><br />If anyone needs an episode list -- here it is --<br /><br />1.

0440237688|4.0|I am listening to the CD's... <br />My kids actually liked this book...so I had to see what it was all about. My children, to my horror, do not like to read. I hope that will change.  <br /> <br />I am listening to this in the car when I go to work.  <br /> <br />I took away a star for the beginning...I thought it was too long of an explanation of that crazy way of life...after Jonas turns 12, it gets very good...with lots of metaphors and lessons and imagery. Really enjoying it...makes you not only think but feel!
0553260111|4.0|Really, the writing is just bad for a number of reasons. But for a pulp spy novel, it's a tremendous idea and Ludlum draws it out well. If you can stand a dose of bad characterization and annoying writing techniques in exchange for a great plot- pick it up. I liked this book quite a lot despite its flaws, which says a lot for the ideas Ludlum was capable of dreaming up.
B000002KO3|5.0|I first heard this record either my sophomore or junior year in college. It was late one night and I'm sitting at my computer reading music reviews and I always heard these great things about the album \\"Remain In Light\\" as well as the Talking Heads. Rolling Stone (a magazine I cannot stand primarily for the rankings they always do) ranked this record the third greatest album of the 80's. (After #1 \\"London Calling\\" and #2 \\"Purple Rain\\"). I'm a lover of old-school music so I had to hear this record....I had to hear the Talking Heads. Luckily, my roommate had this CD and I listened to it at about 2 in the morning.<br /><br />The record opens with \\"Born Under Punches\\" (The Heat Goes On). I did not get it at first. I'll go so far as to say I did not even like this record. All I liked was \\"Crosseyed and Painless\\". The music was too weird for my liking.<br /><br />The next day I decided to give it another chance. And man, am I glad I did. This record is flat out ridiculous!! You want funky music?? The entire first side is filled with killer grooves. Tracks 1-4 are danceable and will either make you move or do something. You cannot stand still while listening to this record. This is possibly the first record by a prominent band exploring African polyrhythms....all that really means is that each member of the band is doing their own thing within the song. The additons of Adrian Belew (guitar), Steve Scales (percussion) and Funk Legend Bernie Worrel (Parliment/Funkadelic) on keyboard give the band a complete sound not heard before. The second side starting with \\"Houses in Motion\\" slows the record down but the funk does not go away. Concluding with \\"The Overload\\" which has producer Brian Eno's influence all over it. (Eno was also on \\"Buildings and Food\\" and \\"Fear of Music\\" (The track is a very \\"Low\\", \\"Heroes\\" era David Bowie track, albums which Eno also produced).<br /><br />The funk that started on \\"Fear of Music\\" is magnified ten-fold on this record. My two favorite songs are \\"Crosseyed and Painless\\" and \\"Once In A Lifetime\\". Starting with \\"Lifetime\\", this was the single from this record and it had a video as well. This is considered by many to be the band's greatest song. Watery keyboards along with the Weymouth/Frantz tandem and David being David with the lyrics makes this songs special. But to me, \\"Crosseyed and Painless\\" is the jewel of this record.<br /><br />When I first heard this song back in college I immediately thought it was amazing. This is pure funk. I listened to it about 20 times that night. (No exaggeration) Tina Weymouth'a bass destroys this track and with everything going on at once it is almost impossible to name all the instruments on this one track. (Or any track for that matter) Weymouth has to be one of the best bassists. She never plays anything too complicated but she never messes up, never drops the rhythm. The bass fits in perfectly on these tracks. Frantz does not drop his 4/4 pattern and the track just has so much life. More than any other record, Byrne's lyrics really do not matter nor what the songs are about. This record is all about the music....the polyrhythms. The Talking Heads were so inventive and their music crossed all racial boundries. Songs from the record were played on Black and White radio stations. The influence of this record was felt throughout the entire decade in Rock, Funk and R&B music by groups wanting to branch out in their music.<br /><br />As great as the music is it is kind of strange to me that it has not been sampled more often. This album has \\"SAMPLE ME\\" written all over it!! Those who think this music is monotonous are not seeing the big picture. I think it is harder to play the same part over and over because one slip and the whole track is wasted. The Talking Heads were all about precision and given time this records seeps in the your mind and body and it cannot be escaped. This is a must listen. If you are interested in the band this is the place to start. No one else wasdoing music like this back then and that is why it is considered a landmark. Talking Heads- One of my all-time favorite bands.
B000F3UAFC|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from this film, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I enjoyed the story.  I purchased the movie for no particular reason, just to see something different. <br /> <br />I didn't see the twist coming and I appreciated the ending.  It is now one of my favorite movies.
B000002KNY|5.0|First off....What an amazing title for a record. \\"Fear Of Music\\"....I find that hilarious. But coming from the mind of David Byrne I guess it should not come as such a huge surprise. What IS surprising about this record is how FUNKY it is. That's right's....funky. Who knew that David Byrne, Jerry Harrison, Tina Weymouth and Chris Frantz had it in them? \\"More Songs About Buildings and Food\\" (another hilarious title) may have hinted at this direction slighty but I don't know how to catergorize this band and that may be the reason they fascinate me so much. Along with \\"Remain In Light\\" this record showed the Talking Heads maturing and at the same time we get to see what their souls look like.     This is the record where the band began to rely heavily on their rhythm section. This is music that grabs you at first listen and just does not let go on repeated listens. The more listens, the more addicting it becomes. As I said before I don't know if this is R&B, Funk, Rock or New Wave but I do know that the band makes it work. (Think about it....they are considered art-school Punks)    \\"I Zimbra\\" kicks the record off and the change in style from the previous records is immediately noticeable. Nonsense lyrics, great bass....it sets the record up nicely. \\"Mind\\" and \\"Paper\\" follow and then tracks 4 and 5 kick in and to me are worth the price of the CD.    \\"Cities\\" and \\"Life During Wartime\\" simply are stunning. (Great live versions are present on the \\"Stop Making Sense\\" DVD) Have you ever heard of a lead bass part?? (I'm not talking Geddy Lee, Les Claypool, Cliff Burton, Bootsy Collins, Victor Wooten, Jaco Pastorius virtuso bass) I mean a straight driving, funky bassline that is in essence the melody of the song. (Until the solo in the middle section but it's a solo, not melody) I know what I wrote may not make sense because it is a bass but Tina Weymouth put it down on this track!! She has the only moving part in the song which accounts for the melody. The first time I heard\\"Cities\\" I was in disbelief and it is funky as hell!! She's not the most technically proficient bassist but she has to be on the greatest bassist of the late 70's and early 80's. (In my opinion one of the greatest ever). If you need someone to hold down a rhythm she is right up there with the best. Frantz's drums blend it perfectly and David's playing his rhythm part and singing in his glorious vocal style. \\"Cities\\" is just a great song and one of my favorite by the band.     No time to rest though because \\"Life During Wartime\\" follows and the momentum does not stop. The funk vibe continues and David has some of his most famous lyrics....\\"This ain't no party/This ain't no disco/This ain't foolin' around. This ain't the mud club/or CBGB/I ain't got time for that now!\\" This was the only single from the record and the most popular song  because of it. It's a great song. Tina's bass is not as forceful in this track but she's in the back doin' her thing. David is the star of this one and it is what we expect from him. Great song.    \\"Heaven\\" is another great track and a beautiful ballad about a bar in England. This slows the momentum some after \\"Air\\" (some people have a problem with air) but still is amazing. The rest of the record holds together nicely although there are some weaker moments that don't deter from the end product which is an awesome record. This is a very unique band that were not afraid of taking risks to create art. And before I forget....this record was produced by Brian Eno who knows a little bit about what he's doing. (that was an understatement, Eno is awesome). He produced \\"Buildings and Food\\" and \\"Remain in Light\\" as well. NOTE: This is a transitional album. (Like \\"Station to Station\\" before Bowie went on the make \\"Low\\" and Heroes\\" also produced by Eno) All that means is a definite change is taking place to set up music in the future. The funkiness that was present on this record comes full blown on \\"Remain in Light\\" but this record is great on it's own. If you like this band and don't have this you are missing out. Even though the Talking Heads started at CBGB and are sometimes called a \\"Punk\\" band I think \\"New Wave\\" fits them better. It may take a while to warm up to but once you give it chance it will not be too far away from you.
B000FSME1A|4.0|Francis Ford Coppola delivers one of the year's best commentaries in the double-disc release of \\"Apocalypse Now: The Complete Dossier.\\" \\"I wanted to make it as a great big Hollywood movie,\\" Coppola says. \\"I wanted it to have the biggest picture -- the greatest sound.\\"<br /><br />Paramount's DVD set carries out Coppola's orders: Both films looked outstanding on the previous DVDs, but the video quality takes another step up here, to near reference quality, thanks to a transfer at an improved bit rate. Colors seem more saturated in spots, like the Charlie-don't-surf scene. The aspect ratio comes in at 2.0:1, a crop that cinematographer Vittorio Storaro intended to split the difference between pan-and-scan and widescreen, according to the extras. The detailed and powerful 5.1 audio carpet-bombs the soundstage.<br /><br />Paramount exposes itself to friendly fire with the set's title -- as many Amazon reviewers have groused below, no \\"Apocalypse\\" project is complete without the superb documentary \\"Hearts of Darkness,\\" filmed by Coppola's wife, Eleanor. (That film is not out on DVD, apparently because of rights issues.) The set does deliver a robust selection of extra features, mostly new short films dealing with the production and postproduction. There are numerous deleted scenes, mostly curiosities in rough shape. The best is an indie-like short built around 17 minutes of Brando reading T.S. Eliot's \\"The Hollow Men.\\"<br /><br />Viewers will experience flashbacks to the early days of DVD, as both versions of the film require a disc change midway through. (My first copy froze in the opening scene, but a second copy worked fine.)
B000GRTQSE|5.0|I laugh, I cry, I listen in awe.  People who criticize, I'm curious what their 5 star might be...probably some \\"5 star\\" album they've written that hasn't found a second ear.  Keep it up BD.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I really hate giving five stars to anything, but this show deserves it.  Without giving away plot lines, here is why it deserves five stars.    1. Production Quality: The location work is beautiful.  A bulk of the work is in-studio (hatch), but you feel like you are very intimate with minute details of that hatch, even into the ventilation ducts.    2. Writing: Lost spends a good deal of time in character development.  Almost every episode contains a flashback for one of the characters.  Pay close attention to these, because other lost-aways make cameos in most of them.  The story remains compelling as characters change roles and attitudes and struggle with their demons.  Some come to terms with them.  At the end of the season, the viewer is left wanting the next episode, badly.    3. Acting:  This cast does a very good job overall.  You are uncertain whether to love or hate some of these people, and you end up doing both with most of them.  Few of the characters are one-dimensional.    4. Buzz: The blogs are full of people speculating about the future...and the past.  What does it all mean?  Everybody has an opinion.    This set is definitely worth your time, and the entire family can watch.
B0009S2T0M|4.0|\\"Oldboy\\" could have been a terrible, terrible movie, bordering on pornography.  The story is an unsettling tale of vengeance, murder, suicide, mutilation, sex, more mutilation, and incest.  The movie seems to focus on what human beings will do in the name of justice, and then twists darkly into an exploration of the ugly aspects of truth. <br /> <br />The plot seems to be simple enough at the outset.  A drunken man is making a fool of himself at the police station, babbling incoherently about missing his daughter's birthday party.  Finally bailed out by his friend, the drunk is swiftly kidnapped off the street by forces unknown.  <br /> <br />And he is kept in prison for fifteen years.  15 years of one room, one TV, and a whole bunch of fried pot stickers.   <br /> <br />And then, he is freed.  He does not know why.  He does not know who did this to him.  He just knows that he must find seek vengeance. <br /> <br />Virtuoso filmmaking elevates this story - one that has a pretty high body count but gets a lot more \\"mileage\\" out of its torture scenes (and there are quite a few) than the killings.  Indeed, the most disturbing death scene involves the live octopus famously consumed at dinner.  This is movie where several body parts are sliced off, penetrated, or pried out of their natural locations, and \\"Oldboy\\" shows none of Quentin Tarantino's restraint - remember when Mr. Blonde cuts off the cop's ear off-screen in \\"Reservoir Dogs\\"?  Very little happens off-screen in \\"Oldboy.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Oldboy\\" is one of those dark, ultraviolent films that has a lot to say and doesn't really leave you feeling all that good at the end.  But like other ultraviolent films like \\"A Clockwork Orange,\\" or \\"Menace 2 Society,\\" or even (in its own way) \\"Natural Born Killers,\\"  that uses its extreme violence and subject matter in an intelligent, entertaining way.  Just be warned - this is far from the feel-good movie of the year.  But if you can stomach it, it's a pretty darn good flick.
B000GG4KTU|2.0|I was excited to learn that there was a new Diana Krall CD available, but was I ever disappointed when I listened to it. Krall has never been the world's best vocalist (Jane Monheit, she ain't), but in her previous work, she had a approach to the material that made her albums appealing and enjoyable to me. Her vocals were mostly subtle, silky, and smooth (listen to \\"The Look of Love\\" for a good example), but she seems largely to have forsaken that style here. Much of this album feels \\"choppy,\\" as if she has a problem phrasing out a complete line of lyrics. She has also developed some odd stylistic quirks, like adding extra syllables to words (she sings \\"exactly like a-you\\" almost every time in the song of that name) and sliding up into notes and falling off them. This last is a nice effect once in a while, but it is used to distraction here. Worse, she doesn't always make it to the top of those slides, leaving the note she is trying to reach out of tune. Judging from earlier reviews, it's obvious that not all listeners object to many of the things I've mentioned--chalk them up to stylistic preferences--but singing out of tune is just plain bad musicianship.<br /><br />While the big band generally plays well as an ensemble, some of the solo work leaves a bit to be desired. Take for example the dueling trumpets in the album's title song--it's just loud, blatant, and downright ugly. There's also a rather horrendous saxophone solo in a song I can't bear to go back and listen to again.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that, for me at least, this is a huge step down from Diana's previous work. I hope that in her next album, she will find her groove again.
1592401791|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  For me, it had been a long time since a book about The Beatles related any stories that I had not previously heard.  This book is filled with some phenomenal stories, and they are mostly about what The Beatles did best; making music.  It is interesting to me that some readers are put off by the fact that Mr. Emerick had a lot of praise for Paul, and that he was critical in varying degrees of John, George and Ringo.  I have also read where his colleague Ken Scott disputes the accuracy of some of Mr. Emerick's stories.  However, I liked that fact that Mr. Emerick told the story from his perspective.  I viewed the book as nothing more than a memoir of his time working with The Beatles.  For example, if you take six people that worked together more than thirty years ago, and asked them each to write a story about that time and place, you will get six different stories.  Each will have a different perspective about how things happened, why those things happened, and how the different personalities affected the results.  Personally, I was always partial to John's music and personality.  The fact that he had such an unpredictable personality does not make me think any less of him as a musician and entertainer.  On the other hand, this book allowed me to see Paul as the consummate career-minded worker.  He used diplomacy by engaging Mr. Emerick and Mr. Martin, which ultimately made them allies for Paul's ideas.  Isn't that the way things work at most jobs?  If you engage people, they will become your allies.  Who can blame Mr. Emerick for having a far more positive view of Paul, who took the time to get to know him, as opposed to John, George and Ringo, who largely ignored him?  I also read where Ken Scott takes issue with the story about the time they tried to record into a submerged microphone in order to get an underwater sound effect for Yellow Submarine.  According to Geoff Emerick, a condom was used to cover the microphone.  Ken Scottclaims they simply used a plastic bag.  Well, maybe they did use a plastic bag.  Or maybe that was the sanitized version of the story that was told in previous years, and Geoff Emerick is finally telling the real story.  The bottom line is that it doesn't matter what they covered the microphone with.  The point of the story is that they submerged the microphone in water in one of numerous efforts to try to devise new ways to achieve recorded sounds.  For me, that is the beauty of this book.  It takes the reader inside the working world of The Beatles, and like any day, week, month or year in the working world, there will be good times as well as bad times; interesting times as well as dull times; joyful times as well as dreadful times.  All in all, as a life-long Beatles fan, I think this is one of the best books I have ever read about The Fab Four.  If you are further interested in learning about The Beatles recording career, I would recommend  Complete Beatles Recording Sessions: The Official Story of the Abbey Road Years 1962-1970 by Mark Lewisohn.
0684800713|2.0|The Summary (short version) <br /> <br />The characters... <br /> <br />Go to restaurants and drink. <br /> <br />Go to bars and drink. <br /> <br />Go home and drink. <br /> <br />Go to bullfights and drink. <br /> <br />Insult each other and drink. <br /> <br />P!ss and drink. <br /> <br />Go to sleep, wake up and drink. <br /> <br />Take baths and drink. <br /> <br />Have sex and drink. <br /> <br />I became an alcoholic just by reading The Sun Also Rises. <br /> <br />Summary (the long version) <br />Several expatriates lick their emotional wounds and cavort around spending money left by their rich parents. The protagonist, Jake Barnes, is a reporter left impotent by a war wound. He and Uncle Toby from Tristram Shandy could have had a ball together (if you've read Tristram Shandy by Laurence Sterne, you'll get the joke). He's in love with the beautiful Brett Ashley, but his impotence makes it impossible for their relationship to have much substance. She falls in and out of love with other men while he stands around watching and feeling jealous. A little bullfighting and violence and drinking later, they're right back where they started: in limbo. <br /> <br />I've never cared for Ernest Hemingway's writing style. It's like he made sure you knew you were reading a story from a REAL man: very macho in tone and style.  And this coupled with the boringness of the story makes The Sun Also Rises a dreadful read.
0060930349|4.0|I am an unabashed  admirer of Howard Zinn, but I am tremendously impressed with Paul Johnson's A History of the American People. I read this book while attending graduate school, years after reading Zinn's fascinating People's history of the United States. Johnson's interrogation of the polemic characters, social movements, and various ideologies provides readers with a brilliant but conservative perspective that is trenchant and well-detailed. Although I consider myself a moderate liberal, I was intrigued on how Johnson describes certain historical figures, For instances, unlike Zinn, Johnson reveres business potentates, such as Rockefeller and Drew, for their philanthropic activities in the late ninetieth century. He is exceedingly critical of Thomas Jefferson, but he adulates Andrew Jackson for his gallantry during the Battle of New Orleans. I recommend students, scholars, general readers, and history buffs, to read this thought-provoking book with Zinn's People's History to procure a well-balanced understanding of American history and the people and ideas that shaped this great nation.             <br />
B000GCFO0I|4.0|I am wary to purchase this film. Why? Because it has \\"Unrated Version\\" written all over it (it's invisible but I swear I see it) and I would hate to purchase this edition only to have an alternate version soon available.  <br />That said...  <br />This is a scary movie. There is no way around that fact. The film does deliver on the heebie-jeebies. For proof of this look no further than the burning babies in the dark alley. They had a eerie shriek and their relentless chase after the heroine was just down right creepy. Even knowing that she was the central character of the story did not take away from the overall \\"frightfest\\" those demonic infants had.  <br />But... there is more. Even for his short amount of screen time... Pyramid Head ruled when it came to delivering the dread. Seeing that deformity carrying around the sword bigger than my mamma and surrounded by all those bugs was nothing short of heart stopping. In reality, if something like that was after me... I'd be a wreck for sure. <br />Then there were the faceless nurses. They were evil, creepy, and sexy to boot. Some guys wouldn't mind being trapped in a room with nurses like that... though, once the lights go on and they go all \\"violent\\" I'm sure a different tune would be sung.  <br />Of course, there were some downer moments as well. The little girl, when in evil mode, was just unconvincing. The \\"other people\\" in Silent Hill were too dirty and dark to not give the lead doubts about their mental status. She became too trusting of them too fast... as where I would have been more wary; afterall, everyhting else in Silent Hill had proven to be evil. Add to that the ending which left me saying \\"Huh?\\" instead of \\"Oh...\\" Although the climatic showdown was something you would see in a hellraiser movie... (now that was entertaining) <br />So... I would wait just a little bit to see if there is indeed an unrated version on its way before spending the bucks on this one. Part of me expects it to happen (afterall they did not make much money from it in theaters) so I'm going to hold out and see what happens.
B000GPI15K|5.0|I was introduced to Patricia Barber via the audiophile route as her cds  <br />recording quality has always been excellent. Over the years I got to appreciate her music. What I love about Partricia Barber is that she has a sound like no one else, her piano playing is first class, and her songwriting is sublime and original. Each of Miss Barber cd been another step forward, and this one is full of surprise catching you unaware <br />at every turn. I am really tired of the old format of a singer being backed by the standard piano trio, singing the same old songs. <br />Miss Barber is different she is absolutely unique and I am sure in the years to come will be regarded as one of the great innovator in vocal jazz. <br />Coming back to the audio quality, this is simply the best recording I ever heard, natural, dynamic etc it has everything a real show stopper. <br />Can I give it a million stars?? <br />Definetely my choice for cd of the year, in all categories.
0060934913|5.0|I have a library of several thousand books,but this book is one of the most hilarious,fun,irreverant,informative books on my shelves.And Bourdain can write the acid free paper off most writers.I loved this book.
B000GPI2EK|5.0|I don't usually write reviews, but this album is special. I don't know how they did it, but they somehow managed to best Leviathan, which was already one of the most amazing metal albums ever. This album takes two or three listens to really hear it - it's kind of overwhelming at first. Once you hear it though, it doesn't let go. This is easily one of the most forward-looking and challenging albums I've heard, while still being totally listenable and accessible. I can't write enough great things about this album and this band. They are the best. Bar none.
3937406328|5.0|I only own copies of this series of CDs, and am now going to buy the originals. One of my kids bought them, copied them and sent them to me and I have been hooked on them ever since. This is the most incredible feat anyone extant has achieved in music. I was absolutely floored when I received these CDs, a whole history of blues from that  execration known as slavery to modern times. Every single CD in this group is tremendous. If you love blues, look no further, it is all here. From Chicago to the Mississipi to Texas, from fifties break-out rock to blues ballads and even Celtic blues. What Chris Rea has done is in a word: amazing. Or in more words, it is gob-smacking and mind boggling. And, it's all good. The music is good, the lyrics are good, everything is impeccably done. And, of course, there is that smokey gritty voice which was made for this kind of music.  I've been a so-so fan of Chris Rea for many years. That is, I wasn't the kinda gung ho fan I am of Neil Young and Mark Knopfler, but this achievement of Chris Rea's really shows his immense talent and domination over his music and instruments. After having listened to this, one cannot help but think...what's he gonna do next? How is gonna top this? (And then some no-talent rapper gets the Grammy. Or the Oscar. And the real talent bites the dust. And so it goes. )
B000H305U0|3.0|This is really cool album I really the title song FutureSex/Lovesounds  <br />it sounds like some of old 80's song. Sexyback is the best of song on the cd. My Love with TI this sounds real good nice slow song I like TI sexy slow country drawl. What comes around reminds me of Cry me a river real smooth. Chop me up has a nice hiphop beat with three six mafia all of them repping TN. I really like the new different sound. I don't think its as good at Justied. But it a pretty decent sopmore album it I would give it a C+  <br />
B000F8O4DQ|5.0|Written and recorded in record time after the US tour for \\"Face the Music\\" \\"A New World Record\\" cemented ELO's reputation as making great records. Recorded in Germany (again)the album featured 8 Lynne originals and a remake \\"Do Ya\\" his tune from his days in The Move (which also became a hit single). This reissue sounds terrific (particularly when compared to the original CD release). There's sharper detail throughout the CD.<br /><br />The bonus tracks are a great addition. The best bonus track is the rocking \\"Surrender\\" which should have been on the album (although it's lack of orchestral overdubs would have made it stand out a bit). It's a terrific slice of rock that wouldn't have sounded out of place on The Move's last album. We also get rough instrumental mixes of \\"Tightrope\\", \\"Above the Clouds\\", \\"So Fine\\" and \\"Telephone Line\\". Additionally we get an alternate version of \\"Telephone Line\\" (which became the band's biggest single to date world wide with a UK Gold record the result)with a different vocal take (and without the filter effect at the beginning where it sounds Lynne is singing over the phone). The keyboards are a bit more prominent here as are the backing vocals while the orchestration is a bit further back in the mix (Bevan's drums also sound a bit distorted and fuller here).<br /><br />We get liner notes on the making of the album how it charted and Lynne briefly commenting on the various songs on the album. This is a terrific reissue that fans have been waiting for. The only thing missing is a replica of the original embossed sleeve (they could have done that to the cover artwork).
B000BKJ78U|1.0|These are not the original movies; they are modified versions of the original films that have been tinkered with over the years in various ways. I sold my copies cheap at a garage sale recently, because I could no longer stand to watch them. If the original movies were released on DVD, I would probably buy them. I loved those old movies without the added musical numbers, CGI characters, extra sound effects, etc., etc., etc. This version was a disappointment because all of that new stuff is so distracting that it takes away from the gentle spirit and lovable goodwill of the original theatrical releases.
0142001104|4.0|This book was recommended to me several times, and I'm glad I finally found the time to read it.<br /><br />Written by the husband-wife team of Ben and Ros Zander, the Art of Possibility asserts that our lives actually hold a universe of possibility right now - it is simply our frame of reference which locks us into our place.<br /><br />What makes the book interesting is their tag-team approach.  Ben Zander is a world-class orchestral conductor, while Ros is a psychologist.  Back and forth, with fascinating stories and anecdotes, they reveal their \\"practices,\\" methods of changing one's perspective to be open to the universe of possibility.<br /><br />Most of their ideas are exciting and transforming.  I loved the idea of facing every day asking, \\"How can I most contribute to helping others today?\\"  Rule No. 6 is also a fantastic lesson, as well as the concept of empowering others to be leaders, even in nontraditional roles.<br /><br />Though I did not agree with every single course of action in the book, I think TAOP invites the reader to rethink their outlook on life.  For instance, TAOP implores us to avoid the \\"downward spiral\\" mode of thinking.  This can be seen in the simple example of someone complaining early in the morning because they are \\"having one of THOSE days.\\"  How do you think someone with that frame of mind will view all the daily challenges that face him/her for the rest of that day?<br /><br />It is, of course, possible that someone can read the book and not be much affected by it.  Possible, but not likely.  We all want to find that universe of possibility, after all - we want to be challenged.  For this reason, I recommend this book.
B000AMJDHY|3.0|Judging by the reviews here, I fall in the middle. I don't think this is the greatest CD ever recorded, nor is it dog filth I scraped from the bottom of my shoes. Wow, some people really hate this band. I like the originality of their band name and the song titles/lyrics. I'm tired of the minimalist approach where all 12 songs on a CD have 1 word titles. <br /> <br />I've never listened to Fallout Boy so I don't know if they sound like them or not. I really like some of the melodies. The songs have a punk sensibility with an 80s feel. It's an eclectic style but it leaves them with nowhere to go. The biggest problem is that by the end, the whole CD starts to sound the same. My favorites would be \\"The Only Difference . . .\\", \\"London Beckoned . . .\\", \\"Lying is the most Fun . . .\\" and \\"I Write Sins . . .\\".
B000GPI2EK|5.0|Excellent album. Even more progressive, all while maintaining integrity, conceptual consistency, and mind-blowing time changes. One amazing function the album serves is that, while this is their most technically accomplished album, it by no means overshadows or belittles their past albums. On the contrary, one can conclude by listening to this album that each album is every bit as amazing in their own way. Blood Mountain casts a favorable light on Leviathan and Remission by sticking to the story and not evolving so far as to become unrecognizable. Mastodon's improvements are natural-sounding and totally serve the purpose of the album at the time. In any other case, you might wonder just how the band could improve for the next album. Mastodon have shown through their mastery of songwriting and technical prowess that they don't ever have to \\"outdo\\" themselves, they simply evolve to further their vision. Which they undoubtedly will. This is turning out to be the most consistently amazing discography in all of modern metal. It kind of reminds me of Tool.
0679882820|5.0|My son got this book from grandma when he was a little over a year old.  It was an automatic favorite!  It starts with \\"Oh the wonderful sounds Mr. Brown can do.  He can sound like a cow.  He can go moo moo.\\"  It has pictures that are engaging for their simplicity and a rhyme that is flowing but varied so it doen't get boring.  My son loved learning the noises and now he says them along with me when I read.  I've even caught him looking at this book and saying the noises to himself.  He's now 2 and we still read this one often (and I have it memorized).  I highly recommend this book.  I just don't know how you couldn't like it!
B000F8O4E0|5.0|This deluxe remastered edition of the album features a terrific sounding remaster as well as four bonus tracks. From the disturbing opening track \\"Fire on High\\" to the lilting \\"Waterfall\\" (one of Lynne's personal favorites)to \\"Evil Woman\\" the album shows Lynne in top form. The richest melody and ballad (although I love \\"Waterfall\\") (in my opinion) was the closer \\"One Summer Dream\\".<br /><br />We get four bonus tracks. The original \\"Fire on High\\" early mix which lacks many of the overdubs on the final version. An stripped down mix of \\"Evil Woman\\" (Lynne in retrospect feels is superior to the album version. I would agree that rocks harder without the string and backing vocal overdubs and sounds equally as good)created for this release to mimic the early version without overdubs. We also get the single version of \\"Strange Magic\\" which has only appeared on import \\"Best of\\" collections to date and a lovely instrumental mix of \\"Waterfall\\" without the vocals.<br /><br />The booklet features brief comments by Lynne on the songs as well as a brief recording history of the album, how it performed on the charts and photos of the various sleeves for the 45's issued from the album. We also get a pictue of the infamous electric chair billboard that promoted the album in Los Angeles.<br /><br />I have the gold edition released by Sony 7 or 8 years ago and this sounds slightly better to my ears than that original edition. The cool back cover with the band's eyes darkened so it appears that they are staring out at you from the cover is replicated here. The original gold CD had a fold out sleeve that basically replicated the original inner sleeve with lyrics on it. Here it's presented as the much more user friendly booklet.<br /><br />\\"Face the Music\\" became the big breakthrough album for ELO. \\"El Dorado\\" and \\"On the Third Day\\" set the stage for their largest hit album to date.

B00003CX5P|4.0|I think people are being way too hard on this film. The main reason people don'tlike it is because they were expecting Lucas to just remake the original trilogy. What people do not understand is that this is an entirely differnt galaxy that we are in. The entire galaxy has been changed as e enter episode IV. People don't understand that it's a differnt age. <br />       The only thing wrong with this movie is the Gungans, and that is a very minor annoyance.
B000002JOH|4.0|With raw, angry guitar and powerful riffs, Pantera's Vulgar Display of Power attacks from the very first note. Phil Anselmo's unholy singing growl was the perfect voice for these heavy, dark songs. One of the best metal CDs around with one of the best titles as well. Dimebag Darrell's solos snarl at you and by the time you finish listening you're exhausted. If you're having a lousy day or have any aggression you need to get out of your system, this is the CD for you.
B000H0MKGK|2.0|If you like overproduced pieces of junk, this is the album for you.  I absolutely loved the song \\"Gravity\\" was one of the best guitar solos I ever heard and had alot of soul.   <br /> <br />The version on this cd for some reason sounded like a 5 year old directed it.  The guitar solo is painful and nothing like the original version that I heard  which I am assuming is a live version.  I don't know what happened, I am really just sad.   <br /> <br />Alot of great songs that I am sure sounds awesome when he puts HIS creative genious in it, he needs a new record lable bad so he can stop selling out.
B0002XMF5I|4.0|This is one of the most enjoyable albums from Black Sabbath, Ozzy even says so! Just like another legendary U.K. band Deep Purple, they made a great album without Gillan and Blackmore called \\"Come Taste The Band,\\" well Sabbath did the same, without Dio or Ozzy. But of all people, Deep Purple's Ian Gillan!!! The voice of Jesus Christ Superstar. A strange pairing, but it really does work. Born Again is much closer in spirit to the early 70's albums with Ozzy, and Gillan comes off sounding like a mad man, and a drugged up party animal leading Sabbath's original trio down a path of true hard rock high jinx. I find that I reach for this Sabbath album more than any other, not because I'm a Gillan fan, but because of it's inspired vibe, which gives the very best Sabbath albums a run for the money.<br /><br />The only thing holding back the album from 5 stars is the muddy sound quality. Gillan blames bassist Geezer Butler for this. Story has it, Gillan heard the rough mixes (and still has them) and they sounded great, then Gezzer mixed the album with way too much bass. The remastering is actually pretty good, cleaning up some of the problem. Hopefully one day it will be re-mixed, or Mr. Gillan will release the earlier mixes.<br /><br />Highlights: Trashed, Disturbing The Priest, Digital Bitch, Born Again & Keep It Warm<br /><br />Born Again<br />~ Black Sabbath: 4 1/2 stars
0596007124|5.0|This is the first book of the Head First series that I've read, and I have to say that I love it! I think their teaching approach is very very efficient. Each concept is presented to you in many different ways and at the end your brain finds its way to metabolize it. Sometimes it's a picture that catch your attention, sometimes it's just a joke but at the end the concept sticks in your head and is gonna be there forever (at least I hope so :-))) ). Moreover this book is so easy to read. I recommend it to anybody that wants to learn Design Patterns (in Java) in a painless and fast way.

B0009MUBEY|5.0|Don't be wrong. This is the second part of the TV series \\"Karol: A Man Who Became Pope\\". If the first part is very good, inspirational, it doesn't matter if you are or not catholic, the history of this Pope is a mandatory reference to both centuries, the 20th and 21th. This movie begins when karol became John Paul II. The music.....aaaah, the music was composed for Ennio Morricone....if you enjoy the music of The Mission, you will love this soundtrack.
B000059TEP|4.0|Phenominally successful film, about a man named Sam , who is killed and begins his journey to solving his own murder , as a ghost. Simple plot , however , the story is told with a fantastic cast. Whoopie Goldburg gives an outstanding, Oscar winning, performance as the medium that helps , Sam , communicate and get his earthly revenge. Everyone says this is a great film. I say , ditto.<br /> Highly recommended drama.

B000GG4KTU|2.0|I doubt I will be buying another Diana Krall album anytime soon.  Though I really love her older records such as All for You, Live in Paris, the past few albums have left me cold.  This one sounds just too contrived and commercial.  I would just love to hear her with her trio again, but I wonder if that will ever happen. <br /> <br />
B000FVRACK|5.0|Rubinstein was the ultimate concert pianist. He played 100-plus engagements a year for some seven decades. Even as an old man he had ten recital programs and twenty concertos at his fingertips. For half a century he maintained a busy recording schedule, ranging from Mozart to Villa-Lobos and including a full dose of chamber music. He was the Caruso of the keyboard, the Babe Ruth of the 88s.<br /><br />Sure enough, back in the early 1940s American critic/composer Virgil Thomson headlined him as the \\"King of Pianists,\\" and Rubinstein wore that crown for the next 35 years. Other big names made periodic splashes (Gilels, Richter, Cliburn, Gould) or emerged briefly from hiding (Horowitz, Michelangeli), but when the dust settled Rubinstein still sat on the throne. \\"Nobody will put up much of an argument,\\" the N.Y. Times' Harold C. Schonberg once wrote, \\"when he's called the greatest living pianist.\\" Yet in his day he was such a familiar and accessible commodity, listeners seldom pondered exactly where his superiority lay.<br /><br />It was simple enough. As Lauritz Melchior was the greatest of heldentenors, Rubinstein was the preeminent \\"heldenpianist.\\" Boasting both an enormous dynamic range and phenomenal stamina, he could play not only long seasons but heavy heroic programs (e.g., both Brahms concertos at one sitting). He was renowned for his deep full tone, his cataclysmic volume, his velvet cantilenas, his huge declamatory octaves. Rubinstein came honestly by it all: after a youthful brush with repetitive stress syndrome, he adopted a temperate practice regimen and developed one of the most efficient virtuoso mechanisms in the history of his instrument. Its foundation was a centered posture, participation of the entire torso, and exceptional lateral mobility; working strictly with moderate-action instruments, he could dig deep into the keys.<br /><br />It's significant, then, that the end came for him not from fading fingers but failing eyesight--macular degeneration. His frontal vision suddenly went, and it was enough to take the edge off his accuracy and reliability. He prudently retired. At age 89.<br /><br />Luckily the present video (three Rubinstein blockbusters--the Grieg concerto, Chopin's Concerto No. 2, Saint-Saens' Concerto No. 2) had been taped some months earlier on April 22-24, 1975. Of the assorted Rubinstein DVDs currently on the market, this is easily the most cherishable. Not surprisingly, picture and sound are far superior to the 1990 VHS release, and by any criteria this is first-rate analog stereo--though the piano is appreciably forward, sometimes upstaging the string tremolos in the Chopin middle movement. As for the picture, it's in plush technicolor: the camera favors both left and right profiles as Rubinstein digs in, close-ups of his hands ditto, head shots are framed by the piano lid. Previn and individual deskmen enjoy occasional close-ups as well, but the full orchestra is on view only from the rear of the hall.<br /><br />With Previn and the LSO providing elegantly phrased backup, the performances themselves are invaluable. These, literally, are Rubinstein's final thoughts on a trio of audience favorites he'd performed over many decades (three-quarters of a century in the case of the Saint-Saens). Even at 88 he's easily equal to the stiff technical demands (cleaner and firmer with Chopin's passagework than in his Philadelphia recording seven years before). Unforgettable moments abound in each of these performances: tempos are generally more spacious than earlier, with the expected gains in precision and clarity; he's more economical, too, with half tints and pedal washes in cantabile passages, but the arching phrases and tapered cadences are as eloquent as ever. Astonishingly, his fortissimos are still colossal in the big Grieg cadenza, and the old man can still burn up the tracks in the finale of the Saint-Saens.<br /><br />Further, and maybe even more affecting, Rubinstein was still reconsidering, still revising, still working on things. Here, for instance, you'll find the most intensely operatic of all his readings of the Chopin Larghetto--sharply phrased, stinging in the filigree, downright ferocious in the central recitative, ultimately turning gentle and nocturnal in the recap.<br /><br />Finally there's a splendid bonus: a 29-minute conversation with PBS newscaster Bob MacNeil, recorded in the late 1970s after Rubinstein's retirement. The pianist tackles a range of material with humor and shrewdness: communicating with popular audiences, producing his famous sound, his concept of God, life after death. It's easily the most articulate and stimulating interview I've heard him give.<br /><br />So this DVD paints the regal close of a colossal reign: as indicated, the bonus is a delight, and you'll never hear more opulent, more exhilarating performances of these three pet concertos. Heartily recommended for all viewers. Including folks who normally avoid classical music.gs.

6305212112|5.0|This is a \\"girl power\\" movie on the surface, but on the larger scale it's about how loss and grief have far-reaching effects.<br /><br />When Idgie Threadgood's older brother Buddy is killed in a freak train accident (I still can't bear to watch that part, no matter how many times I've seen the movie), she loses the big brother she idolizes.  Pure tom boy, none of the others in her home seem to understand her.  Witnessing Buddy's terrible death firsthand only causes Idgie to become withdrawn and strangely eccentric as time goes on.<br /><br />Thinking that only one other person can draw her out of this cocoon of grief and reaction--Ruth, the girlfriend Buddy left behind who also witnessed the same train accident--Idgie's mother calls Ruth home for a summer.  Now a young woman, Idgie seems one part tomboy, and two parts a strange kind of 1930's train-riding Beatnick (albeit a bit early for that.)<br /><br />The two women forge a powerful relationship, one that sees them through abusive marriage, murder, and a unique kind of love.<br /><br />Highly recommended for women of all ages, but don't be surprised if you need your hankies.<br /><br />Deidre
B00004YYDI|4.0|so I bought the two disc deluxe edition last night from barnes and noble after an exhaustive attempt to discover which version of this dvd is the best. The DE is not it. The Uncut International Version is the only version that has, to my knowledge, all the original scenes that were later cut for american audiences. Both the Deluxe Edition and the Uncut International Version have the same listed running time, at 133 minutes each. However, after watching the DE, I realized that they are not the same, that at least one of the controversial \\"love\\" scenes between portman and reno has been cut. Even though the scenes are perhaps a bit uncomfortable, there is a tenderness to them that ties the whole film together in a way that none of the cut versions can quite accomplish. I personally don't see them as anything too controversial and I don't really understand why they needed to be cut in the first place. anyhow, my point is this. Buy the Uncut International Version. It is the ONLY complete dvd version of this film. barnes and noble were even good enough to let me exchange my already opened deluxe edition after i explained the situation.
0446677450|4.0|First things first--DO NOT center your entire financial plan around this book. The financial planning advice is incredibly vague, and not always realistic, especially if you know nothing about real estate. <br /> <br />However, I found this book to be a valuable read as far as helping to change my attitude about money. <br /> <br />The basic summary of Kiyosaki's attitude towards money is that if your only solution to the problem of not having enough money is to get a higher-paying job--you're not trying hard enough. <br /> <br />He outlines a number of issues that were eye-openers for me, most importantly the fact that a lot of people, no matter how much money they have, can't manage it well. One example, which he didn't bring up but which came to mind, is M.C. Hammer. In the early 1990s, this guy was on top of the world as far as money goes. In less than a decade he was flat broke, and today he gets by on selling ringtones. <br /> <br />Another point the author brought up was the idea of making your money work for you. While some people know the basics of investing and utilize them, many either don't know, or choose not to act on their knowledge. Also, people tend to play it safe, without really doing too much research beyond stable mutual funds. <br /> <br />The biggest lesson I learned, though, was about how emotions--fear in particular--affect how many people handle money, me included. We have the fear of not having enough money conditioned into us by our society. That's why we're told to go to school, so you can get a good job--working for someone else. We're afriad to take chances, and we're also afraid to do anything that doesn't get the bills paid first. Granted, I'm not an advocate of putting all your eggs into a shaky basket. But that's where educating yourself on financial issues and opportunities comes in. <br /> <br />Again, don't take this book as a whole. While Kiyosaki advocates taking risks in investing, he doesn't do that much risk assessment, nordoes he have a realistic viewpoint of the average person's situation. He's had a lifetime of learning money management, whereas the average reader has very little, if any. Taking someone else's advice without being educated can be disastrous. <br /> <br />Use this book as motivation adn inspiration--but make sure you do a lot of research, too.
B00004T9UF|5.0|The rhymes and visuals eminem portays on the song Who Knew just shows how good this album really is. You have the violent nature on Kim, and the fact that eminem tries to relate to kids (do drugs, etc..) There are a ton of aspects on this album which define eminem as an artist. Any review which denies that, has their own opinion, but fails to recognize this talent. Great album, probably the best from eminem; the classic album.
B000H0MKOC|5.0|I'll start off by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed myself watching this movie.  I laughed during the whole movie, and not just a chuckle.  It's definitely one of the best adult comedies of 2006, joining the ranks of Scoop and Little Miss Sunshine.    It's one of the best satires I've seen.  It's done really well, with a great story, and it's relatively brave in staring Tobacco Companies straight in the face.  The story, as satirical as it is, also tends to be endearing at times when the focus is on the father-son relationship.    The casting is perfect...after all, as the saying goes, Aaron Eckhart was born to play Nick Naylor. The supporting cast is just as perfect.  I completely bought each and every one of their performances, from Maria Bello to J.K. Simmons, and the legend Robert Duvall.  I'm still split on Katie Holmes though.  She's not bad, she's just very \\"Katie Holmes-ish\\", whatever that turns out to be.    The performance I enjoyed the most though had to be from William H. Macy.  I'm not a fan of his at all, but he was just perfect as the Vermont Senator campaigning against the tobacco industry.  His performance was PRICELESS!  I got the biggest laughs out of him, from him in his office to him at the Senate Hearing at the end.  If for anything, this movie is worth watching just for those last 10 minutes and William H. Macy's performance during the Senate Hearing.  That will forever remain one of my favorite scenes of all time.    This is a movie I'd definitely recommend.  It's funny and smart, what more could you ask for?

B000F8O4DQ|5.0|The remaster of \\"A New World Record\\" left me completely speechless, in the best way possible. I thought the album sounded fantastic on the horrible record to cassette transfer my dad made some twenty years ago, but this CD absolutely blew me away when I played it on my computer. The original nine tracks can't be described as anything less than perfect. I can't imagine them sounding any better unless I was hearing them straight from Jeff Lynne & Co. in a concert. <br /> <br />The bonus tracks are simply brilliant. Just like the amazing instrumental take of \\"Waterfall\\" from the \\"Face the Music\\" remaster, the \\"Telephone Line\\" instrumental almost brings me to tears due to its shear power. The instrumental cuts of \\"Above the Clouds,\\" \\"So Fine\\" and \\"Tightrope\\" are almost as stunning. There's even a cut of \\"Telephone Line\\" with slightly different vocals and the ending used in concert performances. What really makes the bonus tracks great(er) is the inclusion of \\"Surrender,\\" a track that was supposedly written during the ANWR recording period, but dropped from the final cut. It definitely has a certain Traveling Wilburys/\\"Armchair Theatre\\"/\\"Zoom\\" feel to it, but at the same time I can see how the song would've fit with the album back in 1976. <br /> <br />Basically, this is the best I've ever heard ELO. I can't wait for what the \\"Out of the Blue\\" remaster will be like. <br />
B00005JOHI|5.0|This is a beautiful film neatly told. The production design is vividly and visually realistic adding a rare authenticity to this beloved tale. This film had my full attention from beginning to end in part to the cohesiveness of the ensemble of actors. The characters have much more depth than normally would have been expected and made the viewing of this film a delightful outing. This is a beautiful DVD with many extras of substance.
B000AMJDHY|4.0|I think I'm their oldest fan at 54.  Just shows you that good music doesn't have an age limit.  I was changing radio stations and on 2 different stations came across I Write Sins Not Tragedies and just fell in love with the song.  I've since bought the CD and many of the songs on the CD are just as good.  The lyrics are fascinating and the beat just grabs you.  It's a CD well worth owning.
0425129616|5.0|Agatha Christie began her series of Hercule Poirot mysteries in 1920 with THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES.  As the novel opens, it is 1917; the Great War is on, and Lieutenant Arthur Hastings, the novel's genial narrator, has been wounded.  To recuperate he goes to the country estate of a friend, John Cavendish, who lives with his wife, Mary, his younger brother, Lawrence, and a girl, Cynthia, who is the ward of his stepmother, Emily Agnes Inglethorp, who owns the estate.  Mrs. Inglethorp has recently married a man twenty years her junior, whom no one else in the household likes - least of all her paid companion, Evelyn Howard.  Hastings' restful sojourn at Styles is interrupted when Mrs. Inglethorp is poisoned, in a classic locked-room scenario.  Hastings then joins forces with Hercule Poirot, a Belgian refugee and former police inspector living in the village, to hunt down the murderer...and a partnership is born. <br />The story's quaint country-house setting and its depiction of the beginnings of Poirot's English career are its most memorable features.  The intricate murder-plot is great fun, and in developing it the author uses a technique for misleading the reader which she would repeat in later stories.  I can't explain what the technique is without revealing the novel's ending, so I'll just say that THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES is a detective story that should prove just as enjoyable for longtime fans of the charming Poirot as for those new to the character and his creator, Agatha Christie.  Also highly recommended, for those who have finished the novel:  the superb made-for-TV version of THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES, starring David Suchet as Poirot and Hugh Fraser as Hastings, and available on DVD from Amazon.com.        <br />  <br />
078062999X|5.0|Here are a few responses to that ladies \\"mistakes\\" within this perfect movie.   <br />1)Updating it.Do we REALLY need to see \\"Hamlet\\" set in the 19th century?Instead of making the story timeless,Branagh's basically saying \\"I'm making the drama contemporary&speak to our times!\\"This is particularly noticeable when Ophelia ends up-literally-in a straitjacket.   <br />Is making the costumes look like they did in shakesperes time updating?  Elizabethan clothes added to the quality, they look nothing like they did in the 19th century.  Research honey. straight jackest arent new. <br /> <br />2)The bleached hair,which looks incredibly fake.It's distracting.Does Hamlet have to be a bottle blonde?  <br />He's a DANE! Scandanavians ALL have white blonde hair, it was nessceary to add to its authenticity like they did with the elizabethean costumes. <br /> <br />3)The gratuitous Hamlet&Ophelia love scenes.When I saw this in college,my friends burst out laughing every time the Melancholy Dane jumped into bed with Ophelia.This gave away too much information--and wasn't helpful.Shakespeare wisely left the level of intimacy to the readers&the audience to figure out. <br />-You and your friends need to grow up, I'm a freshmen in college and saw this movie for the first time as a Senior in High School, I didnt laigh or think it was tasteless.  It added to the intenstiy of thier love, He was her first time, she adored him. <br />4)The Roger Corman-style special effects for the ghost.The ghost of Hamlet's father is supposed to be eerie&moving,not a joke.  <br />That was a little odd, but still well done. <br />5)Using the ENTIRE uncut drama.There are different versions for a reason.Branagh drew it out longer than necessary.Franco Zeferelli used the shorter version&was better for it. <br />What the F***!!! The Mel Gibson movie sucked!  It lacked the depth of this one, if you dont have the attention span to watch one of the best plays ever written put to film for the masses, you dont deserve to comment.  <br />6)Too many \\"guest star\\" cameos by Billy Crystal,Jack Lemmon&Robin Williams.Why did he choose comedians,or just ebcause they're famous? -He chose them because they were good actors, what athought!  Now why didnt he use hell gibson, because he CANT ACT!  those are all great actors deserving of thier roles, casted impecably  <br />7)Branagh's hammy acting as Hamlet.He comes across as hilarious instead of insane.  Were we watching the same movie?  <br />You're better off with the Zeferelli version starring Mel Gibson.This movie is too long,too hammy,and it's one of the most unintentionally funny versions of Shakespeare!Turns out Branagh didn't need the Reduced Shakespeare Company for this one.-ITS HILLARIOUS!  DRAMATIC! EXCELLENT!  YOUR AN UNCULTURED BOOB if you think mel gibsons version was better!   <br />People dont listen to this crazy person, this will bring hamlet to you like no other, its perfetc (almost)
0066620996|4.0|After reading this book for myself and then reading many of the reviews here, I found myself wondering if this book is really about business at all.  To be honest with you, in the end, I don't think it really is.  I think business is simply a platform for study, but the heart of what this book is after is about people, and their principles and actions and how it can change the course of your life and of others.  It's about personal insight, knowing who you are and what it will take to succeed at what you are passionate about.  These are things you can apply anywhere - in your personal lives, not just your jobs.  Being humble, yet persistent and driven, like level 5 leaders, can apply to anyone, anytime, anywhere.  Surrounding yourself with quality people, not ones that just kiss your rear-end and take orders, but who are honest and challenge you goes beyond just business.  Having disciplined thoughts and actions, knowing what you are good at and following it passionately, are all things we can do every day in many ways.<br />I wish this book was longer with more real word examples.  It felt a little empty hearing they did sooo much research and then had so few examples to talk about.  I would like to see a follow up to this book that pulls in examples of small business as well as schools and government agencies that followed good to great principles.  The yuma Arizona school system and Dallas police force come to mind.
B000HEVZ8K|4.0|I just watched THE SEARCHERS on HD DVD and was extremely impressed.  The color transfer is absolutely brilliant.  The colors are vibrant and alive, and the Utah badlands where the film was shot is gloriously represented in shape, shadow, and shade.  The film was originally shot in Technicolor in 1956, but I had no idea what the quality would be like until I popped the disc in and the first few frames started playing.  The wide, sweeping shots through the camera lens are breath-taking, but the filtered effects to do the \\"night\\" shots hold a glow to them and sharpness of the actors' shadows that just isn't possible in true dark.  Still, rather than being distracting, it's more indicative of the process that was used.<br /><br />John Wayne stars as Ethan Edwards, a Confederate cavalry man returning to his brother's farm after three years of wandering.  No soon is the family introduced than Ethan is called away to help track a band of Indian horse thieves.  But the trail is just a ruse and the Texas Rangers end up getting back too late to save their loved ones.  This starts up a manhunt for the last little girl from the family.  The trail crosses thousands of miles and five years, and involves changes within the characters.<br /><br />THE SEARCHERS was the 12th film John Wayne worked on with John Ford, and it stands the test of time as one of their greatest achievements.<br /><br />Although the story is a slower-paced than present-day tales would be, it encompasses a lot of territory and a lot of emotion.  Some of the accents(such as Ken Curtis's portrayal of Charlie McCory) were too pronounced and struck a false note.  And Jeffrey Hunter's emotional outlets were sometimes too forced.  The action sequences were given short shrift by today's standards as well, but on the plus side, a lot happens in the two hours of movie time.<br /><br />Western fans and John Wayne fans have probably already got this one.  If not, they should.  But the HD DVD version is definitely a reason to start thinking about plunking down hard-earned cash to upgrade the home entertainment system.y a reason to start thinking about plunking down hard-earned cash to upgrade the home entertainment system.
6304708491|4.0|It's symptomatic of middle-age, I suppose, to reflect warmly on \\"the good old days\\", and even though I never wanted to fall into that syndrome, seeing \\"Help\\" has done exactly that for me. I was a Freshman in college when the movie was released, and so it was a movie for the millions of Boomers like me, in that bizarre, wonderful time that was the mid-1960's in America.     Others have already written far more insightfully and fully than I intend to here. Simply -- if you like the Beatles, their witty, irreverent, and intellectual sense of humor, their music, and the whole 60's \\"British Invasion\\" period, you will surely enjoy this comedy. It was one last cheerful, happy, ridiculous romp for we teenagers of the 60's before the somber, discouraging misery of Vietnam settled in for a long, long time. It could be argued that, in a sense, my generation lost its sense of humor after \\"Help\\".... If a movie like \\"Help\\" were released today it would fall flat and be ridiculed, unless it were positioned as some kind of Austin Powers spinoff and \\"spoof\\" (how sick I've become of that word) of the \\"Hippie\\" period. Would this happen because as a people we never have regained that genuinely mirthful, joyous sense of humor that we revelled in in other Richard Lester movies, like \\"The Three Musketeers\\", \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", and Franco Zefferelli's \\"The Taming of the Shrew\\"? You make your own call... my generation lived it.      Isn't it a pity that you can't buy \\"Help\\" new anymore? Isn't it interesting that the company that produced \\"Help\\" on DVD is MPI -- which is the same company that, despite overpowering demand, somehow cannot find it possible to release an even more popular, Academy Award-winning movie from the mid-Sixties -- \\"Becket\\"? Isn't it a pity that you can't buy both \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" and \\"Help\\" as a set? Isn't it a pity that no one makes movies like \\"Help\\" anymore?    *********** November 2007 *************   Much to my astonishment, somehow Capitol bought or won therights to this movie away from MPI, and it's been released on two DVD editions. I bought one and enjoyed it quite a lot. I know the purists are going to be unhappy about the full-screen attributes versus the widescreen ones, etc., but the images are crisp, clear, and have rich color saturation. The sound is quite good also, and you can listen to the movie in 5.1 if you want to. Enjoy!
B000BT97AO|4.0|I finally had the opportunity to watch this film on DVD. The movie is written by Neil Gaiman (Author of some graphic novels such as Sandman) and directed/designed by Dave McKean.<br /><br />As the trailer promised, the movie is visually stunning, the designs for surreal locations, characters and effects are simply incredible and with the clear influence of Gaiman's novels (there are some sequences in which the blue screen effects do not look that good but nothing serious) This is a great achievement considering the low budget they had to make this movie.<br /><br />The movie is basically fantasy with a quite simple yet interesting story, a girl suddenly wakes up in a kind of alternate world, the funny thing is that this world is based on the drawings she made in the real world, so she now has to live through the situations and places she herself has created. It is similar to movies like `Labyrinth' or `The Dark Crystal' in the sense that we have a main character with a task to complete, in this case there are two realms, the realm of light and the realm of shadows, Helena has to find the mythical `Mirror mask' to return things to balance and stop the darkness from invading the realm of light.<br /><br />Filled with both funny and tense situations, it is a film for our inner child to fantasize and the adult in us to marvel at the bizarre visuals of the movie. The movie, made by the Jim Henson studios, gives us a clear idea of what to expect in 2008 when the sequel of `The Dark Crystal' is released.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you enjoyed the two films mentioned above, the orbiting giants, the face of the dark queen and the Jack in the box dolls were unbelievable.<br /><br />Extras include some documentaries on the making of the film as well as an interview with Gaiman that are ok, but the movie is worth the money by itself.
B000001DQG|3.0|Elton John was at the height of his poularity during this period.  Having just released the phenominal Goodybye Yellow Brick Road less than a year earlier, this follow up pales by comparison.  Yeah, there are some WONDERFUL songs on Caribou.  Bitch Is Back, Don't Let The Sun..., Pinky, and Ticking come to mind.   <br /> <br />That said, there is some filler on this album.  Songs like Dixie Lilly and Solar Prestige A Gammon actually make me cringe--and I love just about everything E.J. has put out.   <br /> <br />Elton John was a hit making machine in 1974 when this album was released and he prooves his stamina with this effort.  Still, if you're unfamiliar with Elton's music and want to purchase some of his 1970's best, there are better options--like Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Madman Across The Water, Honky Chateau, or even Rock of The Westies.  In my opinion, all of those would make a better choice than Caribou.  His latest, Captian and the Kid and Made In England are also worth a serious listen.
B000GPI2EK|5.0|This is the best album I have purchased this year.  Hands down.  The musicianship on the whole album is flawless.  I bought the album and right after listening to it for the first time bought tickets to their upcoming show.  If you like metal you will not be dissapointed.
B000001EXB|2.0|I've been an E.J. fanatic for a long time.  I've owned everything he's put out with the exception of Victim Of Love (I think I can be forgiven for that).  I find this this album to be adult contemporary elevator music at it's worst.  I wanted so much to love this album---and I tried---I really tried. <br /> <br />Yes, the single, \\"Something About The Way...\\" is catchy and is the saving grace of this album.  Another great song is the haunting, \\"Long Way From Happiness.\\"  Other than that though, I find this work completly forgetable.  It is nowhere NEAR the same league as some of his earlier releases like \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" or \\"Honky Chateau.\\" <br /> <br />Luckily, from his next album releases, \\"Songs From The West Coast\\", \\"Peachtree Road\\", and now \\"Captain & The Kid\\", we now know Elton hadn't totally lost his edge.  After first hearing this dud, I feared he had.  If you have a hankering for some newer E.J. masterpieces, avoid this CD and go for one of the previously mentioned.
B0006IIKS0|5.0|When I had first put the DVD in an watched several minutes of it I thought too myself \\"ohh, great another boring documentary\\", but man after the first half hour I was hooked on this like it was crack cocane. This DVD is incredible from the memory of losing Cliff Burton, to Jason Newsted leaving, to the Napster fraud, to the album production and touring etc, etc. Personally I hate most documentaries, I think most are just straight up boring, but when I watched this there was no stopping my love for Metallica. My favorite part was when they were trying out a new bassist. I seriously wondered I mean man what would Metallica be like if they had chosen Twiggy Ramirez to be their new bassist.
B00001W9G0|4.0|I first saw this movie when I was 13 years old.  I am now 46.  This is one of the best classic love stories that I had ever seen.  Each time I see it the ending makes me cry because I truly think that \\"Hubbell and Katie\\" really loved each other.  The story rang true for me because of the jock meets the radical and against all odds, they got together but then realized that sometimes love isn't enough. This movie will continue to be a true \\"classic love story.\\"
B00003CXBH|5.0|Although the story surrounds the Spanish Jesuits building a mission in the South American wilderness, the real action takes place in the heart.<br /><br />Robert DeNiro gives his best performance ever as an utterly depraved, tormenting slave trader that becomes truly repentant.  This is a beautiful story of grace, as DeNiro tries to pay the ransom of his guilt, and begins to discover mercy, and God's unconditional love.<br /><br />At the same time, questions are raised surrounding the motives behind missionary work.  They should be inspired by the love of God, but other aspirations have been the impetus for many throughout history.  Just as in the Crusades, there were some very good intentioned Christians, but there were also many that killed and conquered in the name of a loving God.<br /><br />This exemplary historical film will provoke thoughts and leave viewers enriched!
B000G75AE8|2.0|kerry king needs to quit writing lyrics. he also needs to stop listening to sum 41. i've been awaiting the return o flombardo for years and i was completely dissapointed to hear his glorious talent ruined by kerry king. slayer used to to have lyrics that would make you think, now the lyrics just make me think about turning off the cd and putting in an older album. if this is the music they are going to be making, perhaps its time for slayer to bow out gracefully and retire instead of ruining what they've already done.
B0009UC7H0|2.0|Finding lost relics & gold, saving the world from destruction, mysterious history, remote settings, non-stop action.  This movie had the fun glitz of the novel, but lacked in much of what made the book a more intelligent read.  Not that Cussler's books are provocative for my mental neurons, I read them when I am in the mood for surrealistic action typical to James Bond.  However, this movie went over the top, to the point of being preposterous.
B000H5U65C|3.0|the music on this album is up to par with their other works, but the album itself is not. they changed their vocals to make them more distinctive and inteligable. it no longer sounds like they're screaming at you from the other side of a canyon where no matter how loud they yell it only serves to further distort what you actually hear. now it sounds like they're using mic filters and studio magic to sing better. some of you might think this is a good thing, but you're wrong. this album has a focused, put together sound that is contrary to their past endevors. they've come a long way from the band that basically made up all of the song lyrics on their first tour, and not in a good way. this album sounds like Bob Rock got a hold of mastodon (any metal head knows thats bad). if i were to equate this album to any other work, i would compare it to metallica's \\"black\\" album. it seems to illustrate the band coming to a fork in the road where true metal goes in one direction, and comercial/ corporate metal goes the other. i hope mastodon doesn't take the same path metallica did and sell out to gain a larger fan base, and i don't really think they will, but this album could be the first stepping stone on the path to selling out. mastodon, fire your producer, and just go back to doing it yourselves. if you (the consumer) are just looking for a new metal album to listen to, then i would recomend buying lamb of god's Sacrament and burning a copy of blood mountain from one of your friends.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I didn't watch any episode on TV.  First I bought the Season 1 DVD set, and loved it so much I went on to buy Season 2.<br /><br />In my opinion the greatest advantage of watching it on DVD is the loss of all the commercial clutter and interruptions.  I read one reviewer who pointed out that at the apex of a very tense scene, ABC decided to flash a grinning \\"Bachelor\\" guy at the bottom of the screen--what a bummer!  In addition, he pointed out that they continually remind you with the popups that it's available in HD, that you're watching ABC, plus a host of their other shows.  And that's before all the commercials.  I use DVR, so I can FF thru the ads, but even so, it's still a major distraction.<br /><br />My friend and I watched the entire first season in one week, and the second season 3 weeks later.  We watched 4 episodes each night.  It was great!  I really felt like I was watching a movie, rather than a TV show.  For this reason alone, I think the DVD sets are definitely worth the price.<br /><br />As for the show, it's fast-moving and combines all the elements one looks for in a good movie--great character development that makes sense psychologically, great acting, suspense, surprise, action and just enough romance (a smidgen) to make it real.  And it always keeps moving--never a dull moment.  Who could ask for more?
B000009HF2|5.0|I never really had the opportunity to listen to frampton's stuff but my coworker (i'll call him \\"Dubord\\") raves about him.  I thought \\"Dubord\\" was full of it until he let me borrow his LP of \\"frampton comes alive\\".  man, i can tell you, it was musical nirvana.  I am continuually awestruck by his talent on the guitar and his amazing tone.  He is a top notch musician with an impressive knowledge and mastery of his instrument.  (Frampton, not dubord.  although dubord is good too but plays a different instrument all together and in general, has less commercial success in the music industry) <br /> <br />now when I hear frampton at work it makes me happy.  i do feel like i do.  yeah baby
0525476881|4.0|I should preface this by saying that as 30something adult, I don't seek out \\"YA\\" (young adult, aka teen) fiction for my leisure reading. In the case of this book, I didn't realize it was a YA title until I was already hooked, and since I'm a fan of quirky coming-of-age novels, it pretty much fit right into my comfort zone. The story is about recent high-school graduate Colin. A former child prodigy, he is now merely another smart teenager with underdeveloped social skills and a yearning to leave his intellectual mark on the world. With the summer between high school and college to kill, he's also heartbroken because his girlfriend, Katherine, just dumped him. Actually, she's the nineteenth Katherine to sever relations with Colin (hence the title) -- although one of the book's enduring mysteries is how someone as neurotic as Colin manages to have relations with 3, let alone 19 girls, whatever they may be named.<br /><br />In any event, Colin is fortunate to posses a roly-poly sidekick/best buddy named Hassan, who promptly prescribes a road trip as the cure for his malaise. Couch potato Hassan provides much-needed comic relief with his blunt talk, tough love, and love for bad daytime TV. It's also nice to see an Arab-American character in such a role. The road trip takes them to a small town in Tennessee, where they stumble into jobs and a place to stay for the summer. They also luck into friendship with a cool local girl named Lindsey and spend a good deal of time hanging out with her and her Abercrombie-wearing friends. Meanwhile, Colin is hard at work trying to figure out the variables needed to plug into a mathematical formula which will graph the rise and fall of any relationship. This provides the excuse to learn about the 19 Katherines, although thankfully just enough to help the reader understand how they affected Colin.<br /><br />As the summer progresses, the story unravels much as one might expect, with the notable exception of an unlikely hookup between Hassan and another character. Lindsey naturally turns out to have hidden depths, and despite the expected heart-warming developments at the end, the story kind of peters out without the closure one might expect. Overall it's a worthwhile read, although it's not a particularly challenging story and Colin is simultaneously too self-pitying and too handy with the ladies to be a truly sympathetic protagonist. Some of Green's stylistic tics work, such as the many footnotes, but the mathematical relationship formula felt kind of gimmicky. Still, this is the second YA novel by Green, and it's definitely enjoyable enough to make me think about seeking out the first.een Hassan and another character.

B000B0WODA|5.0|I have to admit, I REALLY like this album.  I don't own the first album yet, but I can't imagine how it can be much better than this.  It took me three tries to get fully embroiled in this album.  Once that happened I have been playing it non-stop.  There is definitely a punk base to all their songs, but there's something about the pace of their music (ever changing, pulsatile and jagged, then smooth...) that keeps you imbalanced yet wanting more.  I can't wait to try the first album.
0765315246|5.0|This was a refreshing read and I really enjoyed every minute of reading it. Its not life-changing Sci-fi but its a fun story with great characters. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this one and the sequel they are tons of fun.
B00005JNTX|1.0|This movie is not worth the time wasted watching it. I repeat, TERRIBLE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!
B000GIWS7E|4.0|Dream Theater is not a band traditionally associated with restraint. After the low-key Octavarium album and its mixed fan response, the Score DVD is a turn in the opposite direction. By adding an orchestra to the mix, the band goes bigger and more bombastic than ever before. Add in the nearly 10,000-member audience and the expansive production, and you have what is unquestionably Dream Theater's biggest moment.  <br /> <br />Technically, this is a very well-made DVD. The video quality is sharper than on Live at Budokan, ,though I preferred that video's cinematic feel. The sound unquestionably destroys all previous Dream Theater live documents. For the first time on a DT live album, you can sense the size of the space. Guitar and bass tones are rendered with a new sharpness, unlike Kevin Shirley's mix jobs which sometimes seemed like a blanket covered the speakers. The orchestra would sound better on a classical record, but their sound blends well with the band. The biggest problem with the disc itself is that Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, which has always previously been presented as 8 tracks of average length, has been put into one 40-minute mega track. It's a nuisance if you quit watching. <br /> <br />As for the material, well, many longtime Dream Theater fans were rather disappointed with the setlist when first announced. Upon actually hearing it, it's hard to dispute that many of the choices were right (although I would trade Scarred for Innocence Faded in a heartbeat). The chief reason for these choices is the orchestra, which fills out some of the tracks that have always sounded a bit anemic to these ears. Some tracks benefit from the orchestra (Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, The Answer Lies Within), but others fail miserably (Vacant). For its part, the orchestra doesn't perform well without the band to mask its frequent small mistakes. These mishaps ruin the Overture section of Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. As a texture, however, they fill out the band nicely.  <br /> <br />On disc 2 comes an hour-long \\"history of\\" documentary. It's a good summary, but longtime Dream Theater fans won't find much here that they don't already know - the commentary tracks on the Live In Tokyo/5 Years in a Livetime double DVD contain way more fascinating trivia nuggets, and are funnier and more entertaining besides. The additional recordings are just that, and don't contribute anything significant to the band's live record. <br /> <br />Despite Score's shortcomings, Dream Theater fans are sure to snatch it up, and that wouldn't be a terrible idea. The band does sound great, their presentation is grand, and there are exciting rare tracks here. Budokan was better, though. Recommended for DT superfans. Highlights: The Spirit Carries On, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, The Answer Lies Within, Octavarium. <br />
006085880X|5.0|I am a hugh fan of Jodi Picoult's work. This book was no expection. I loved this story, even though its a tough read about suicide. I could not put this book down and I highly recommend it.
B000000XB9|5.0|Why should I write a review for a CD that has 20 songs by Creedence Clearwater Revival!! Seems like a waste of time to me. 5 Stars.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Wow, if you ever want a fun thing to do on a Friday night, just read the reviews for Pet Sounds!  Why is everybody so angry?  Yes, this is an amazing album, and is my personal favorite, but everybody has different tastes.  Everybody thinks that a different album is the best album ever recorded.  Whether you think that or not about Pet Sounds, who cares?  It's still a great album that is essential for anyone's collection.  All this arguing about where exactly it stands on the totum pole is not what Brian Wilson would have wanted.  He wanted to spread love and joy to his fans.  So settle down, buy this album, and just share the love!
B000H0MKGK|4.0|I've been waiting for John Mayer to come out with a new album for some time now. I would constantly imagine what the album might be like; whether it's poppy or bluesy. This album, however, is very bluesy but still retains that oh so relaxing voice that John Mayer possesses. I am very pleased with \\"Continuum\\" as a whole and I must say that my personal favorite song is \\"Belief.\\" It has such a simple bass line and guitar part; the lyrics are excellent (as usual). I like all of the songs on the album and I'm very happy that John Mayer finally found his final place in music (unless he starts rapping now...). I'd highly recommend!
0784011176|1.0|(What do Holly Hunter and Burt Reynolds have in common?) <br /> <br />Just another flick about a gal who falls for an abuser, this time with the gimicks of a waterlogged piano and exotic New Zealand Maori.  <br /> <br />The tribe had it right, though, ignore these two losers and stick with the trees.
B000H305U0|2.0|I read a few reviews from music critics comparing this to \\"The Gloved One\\" in his prime. Needless to say, I had high hopes for JT's sophomore effort. Unfortunately with the exception of the title track and the infectious groove of the radio hit \\"Sexy Back\\", this CD had me looking for the nearest recliner rather than my dancin' shoes. One tired track after another and I suddenly found myself looking forward to the end of the disc. Justin is a very talented guy and the vocals are impressive on a couple of tracks to be sure, but whatever talent he has seems wasted on this snooze-fest. I give it 2 stars and a bunch of zzzzzzzz's.
B000GG4KTU|2.0|I own all the CD'd that Diana Krall has made.  Sorry to say that her last 2 have not been her best.  Love it when she records with just a very small 'back-up' group.  This way she Shines at her best.  Good luck Diana in the future. <br />Jean H.
B00005MP58|5.0|Out of all the P&P movies made, this one is the most charming and most loyal to the book. Although six hours long, it is very nicely done. Some things are not 100% close to the book, but I'd say its 99.8% close, and thats just as close as you can get! If your a Jane Austen fan, or just a P&P fan, this is a must have. You will realy enjoy this!
B000H305U0|5.0|I was really impressed with his album Justified and didn't think that he could do better, obviously I was wrong. You can hear that Justin has definately matured and stepped away from that boy-band appeal.  <br /> <br />I think that the production is also one of the aspects that bring this album out more. Timbaland has introduced something new with the track \\"Sexyback\\" and in my opinion is about to start a new trend in hip-hop. Justin sure knows what his doing when it comes to making choices for production on his albums considering that his previous album was almost completely produced by the Neptunes and on this one Timbaland, two of the best producers ever. <br /> <br />My favourite track on the album is \\"My love (feat. T.I)\\", just love the beat and the vocals. Outsanding... <br /> <br />Get it...
B00004Y6NW|5.0|I still love listening to Knopfler's guitar.  He reminds me a lot of David Gilmour, who never played fast or flashy but still managed to add his signature sound in all the right places at all the right times.<br /><br />This is not the MTV, hit-after-hit, music that came later with Brothers In Arms.  Instead, this is a nice intro to a band that would stick around to give us a lot of great music.  And Mark still makes great music.
0345457684|4.0|I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Once I picked it up I did not want to put it down.  At first glance there is a lot of gratuitous sex and violence.  So if you are turned off by those types of graphic descriptions, this is not the one for you.  But after reading it and placing it within the context of the time and world that Morgan created, it suddenly is no longer gratuitous and rather fits into the story.      I had only read cyberpunk by Stephenson (Diamond Age, Snow Crash) and had always wanted to read some more.  The only author I could seem to come up with that other people said was cyberpunk was Morgan, and yet when I read the synopsis of his books it didn't seem like they fit the bill.  After having read Altered Carbon I would definitely classify this as cyberpunk.    Even though the sex and violence fit the story it did bring my rating down a little, especially the sex in the latter part of the book.  But I really enjoyed the idea of an Envoy detective in a world where people are resleeved.  I can't say, as other reviewers have, that Morgan is rehashing the scifi that is out there because I haven't read enough of that genre to know this.  But I can tell you that this book was a fun and fast read that kept my attention.  I would certainly recommend this book to anyone.    4.5 stars.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|There's a lot of mood music on this cd and for that reason I didn't love 'On An Island' right off.  But it's really good and everytime I hear Gilmour's guitar I'm amazed.  He's still finding ways to make each line exciting after all these years.<br /><br />Nope, it's not Floyd, although there are a lot of Floyd-like sounds.  Definitely worth five stars when you compare it to some of the other stuff getting released today.
B00007BH5C|5.0|Many of the other reviews here sum up how I feel about this music, so I'll be brief:    If you are a fan of these films but have never heard the music by itself, you're really missing out. After watching all 3 films probably 50 times now, I find that I enjoy the music from TTT the most so I finally bought the soundtrack. I knew it was great music but never really realized how powerful, emotional, and DARK it was until hearing this CD.    This is incredible music and I could kick myself for not buying the soundtracks sooner.
0767802470|5.0|This movie is going to bring you down.  That's a fact.  But it's hard to deny this movie all the praise it deserves.<br /><br />A classic tale about men who served in one of the most treacherous environments ever known to man.  It's also hard not to come out of this without a lot of respect for the germans who served in the U Boat service.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|Articles and reviews proclaiming this to be John Mayer's best ever weren't overreaching--Room for Squares and Heavier Things are still impressive and great albums, but Continuum manages to be a progression and completely different at the same time.  Soulful, poignant, and the two forays into the political realm--\\"Waiting on the World to Change\\" and \\"Belief\\" are sensitive and insightful, rather than clumsy or overtly angry like many other singers' attempts to address these issues.  Buy it!
B00000J7SS|3.0|Okay, first off I'm not some jazz purist spouting out about how Bitches Brew ruined jazz. I'm a fan of both rock and funk, both reasons why I bought this one in the first place (I also love Miles, or at least his late-50's work). Having heard all the rave reviews, I was in constant search of a copy of Bitches Brew in my pricerange, but it was always slightly over. That is, until I found a seventeen dollar copy used. Seeing that I was saving $10, I bought it, heavily anticipating the results. I gave it a spin. I was disappointed.<br /><br />First off, we have Pharoah's Dance, not the ideal way to open up the album. It drifts aimlessly for the first five minutes. Then the group locks into a deep groove and plays the hell out of it. Great stuff there. But when it reaches the quarter-hour mark, more aimless drifting! It stays that way until the end of the song. Grr... twenty minutes that could've been ten. The title cut is a masterpiece, even by Miles' standards. Sure, it's long (26:59). But it's also menacing, intense and hypnotic, so by the time it ends, you'll be begging for more. One of my favorite Miles tunes. The disc ends there.<br /><br />I'm anticipating the next cut after the sheer mindblowing title track. What I get is Spanish Key, a song similar to Pharoah's Dance. Why? It starts off as just aimless vamping. If you can, skip to the six-minute mark instantly - Wayne Shorter's soprano sax steals the show, with Miles and John McLaughlan keeping the brilliance going for a while. The issue? The brilliance doesn't keep going long enough, and it decends into technically talented, but aimless and uninteresting, showcases. John McLaughlan is a standout. Sure, it's pretty much (wait for it) John McLaughlan showing off, but let's face it, he can play his guitar. Miles Runs the Voodoo Down, like the title song, is long, menacing, and mesmerising, a deep, hazy, funky groover that's bound to scare the hell out of you and draw you in at the exact same time. A cliche observation, I know, but an appropriate one. Then there's Sanctuary. I cannot recommend this one at all - it's just eleven minutes of wasted tape. Nothing memorable whatsoever. Bleah. Skip it.<br /><br />Okay, so the guy's earlier stuff is great. Bitches Brew could've definetly been a shorter record (edits of Pharoah's Dance and Spanish Key would've helped, as would removing Sanctuary). But if you can find it used, pick it up. Just don't pay full price (for the most part, around $30. You'll be heartbroken. Heavily overrated, but good all the same.now, but an appropriate one. Then there's Sanctuary.

B00003CXD5|5.0|Six years after Humphrey Bogart made \\"Casablanca\\" he starred in yet another classic film, quite different from the aforementioned film. The classic film I'm referring to is, of course, this one...\\"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\" which is a portrait of greed disguised as a treasure-hunter film. When we meet Dobbs (Bogart), he's trying to scrounge up enough money to get out of Mexico. When we meet him, he's basically a beggar. One man he asks for money from instead offers him a job; While working on the job he meets Curtin (Tim Holt) and the two become fast friends. After they're employer neglects to pay them, they're left staying at a crappy...Well, I'd call it a motel but that term would be inaccurate. While trying to sleep, they overhear an old man named Howard (Walter Huston) explaining that people are tempted by gold. If you start off wanting one amount, once you get there you'll want more. Dobbs and Curtin tell the man that they are capable of resisting temptation and pretty soon the three men are in the mountains prospecting for gold. As they hide from bandits and suspicious gold-seekers, Dobbs slowly slips into madness. The film is a study of a subject, but as a character study we watch Dobbs as he gives into temptation (greed) and therefore, reaches his demise. This film only proved that Bogart is one of the finest actors in the world; You truly believe the way he acts. Even though you won't find many people prospecting for gold today, the subject matter and the way it's handled are just as relevant today. Besides Bogart though, Huston and Holt are especially outstanding. Especially Huston, who by today's standards, delivers a performance that could be called \\"campy\\" but it works perfectly. Most people don't know this, but this film contains one of the most famous quotes in movie history. \\"Badges? We don't need to show you no stinking badges.\\" The movie's got a great script; It's funny and entertaining and definitely smart. The acting is superb. At #30 on The American Film Institute's Top 100 and winner of three Academy Awards, you can't go wrong with this film. <br /> <br />GRADE: A-
B0000214F0|1.0|I didn't think of it much as a movie as I did a porn frenzy. I'm very much interested in history and also psychology and neither was apparent to me in this movie other than we know Caligula was nuts. Otherwise, then I guess so was all of the Roman Empire. I simply cannot believe one stroll down the streets would produce such frenzy. It was stupid, simple and as soon as it was done I immediately threw it out. Not for the faint of heart. Not for the sophisticated either. Or anywhere in between.
B00012QM8G|5.0|I guess the title of the review says it all, but I'll be a little more specific for an information hungry audience. If you look at the top 10 films on The American Film Institute's Top 100, you'll find that none of the films were made past the 1970's. In fact, only one of them is even made in the '70s. Eight of the films weren't released after the '50s. The only film in that top 10 to bypass those two eras is this film (which is at #9). Why though? This isn't the first or last film about the Holocaust. Is it because it's one of the most commercial of those films? No. Is it because Steven Spielberg is in the director's chair? Again, no. There are many contributing factors to this film's popularity and brilliance and few of those reasons are because of something you may think. To make a completely accurate film that displays every horror of the Holocaust would be impossible. It's the same with September 11th, which is why two films (United 93 and World Trade Center) have built stories around the event...Which is exactly what this film does. It takes a tragic event and instead of using it as the plot, merely uses it as the setting. It builds from this, the story and plot. The main character, Oskar Schindler, is played in an Oscar-worthy performance by Liam Neeson. An actor most people may know by now as Qui-Gon Jinn in \\"Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.\\" Schindler had no success in business before or after the holocaust and if not for his braveness, would no doubt not be remembered today. Schindler lives in Poland and is a part of the Nazi party. When we meet Schindler he is at a nightclub filled with Nazi officers. He sends them drinks and is soon sitting at tables with them. Spielberg (or is it screenwriter Steve Zaillian) makes it clear from the beginning, without really telling you...Schindler is a conman. As thousands of Jews are killed left and right, Schindler begins planning on opening a factory. The factory will make pots and pans, the workers will be jews. Theywon't be paid a cent and he will profit from it. He sounds like your typical Nazi, which is exactly what his Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley, who is amazing) thinks as well. You probably already know this, but I'll tell you anyway. Schindler's plan was not to make money off the Jews, but to save them from death. <br />It's a big con that Schindler doesn't admit to until the end of the film. If Schindler looked into the camera at the beginning of the movie and explained himself, rather than just being presented as we watch his con unfold, this film wouldn't work as well. Every film, no matter how small, contains it's hero and it's villain. The villian in this film should be the Holocaust, but they focus is on a character...In this case it's Commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes, who plays the character perfectly). It's clear from when we first meet Goeth, that he's not sane. To quote Roger Ebert, \\"War masks his underlying nature as a serial killer.\\" You could easily rank Goeth right up there with Hannibal Lecter, on a list of Evil Characters in Film. (Ironically, Fiennes played a serial killer in the prequel to \\"The Silence of the Lambs,\\" <br />Red Dragon.) With the exception of the opening of the film and the ending, <br />the film is shot entirely in black and white. I don't know if color would have made the film any different, but if that was the case then we would lose one of the most haunting scenes of the film. The only color that appears between the beginning and the end is a young girl wearing red clothing. She, herself, is black&white but her clothes are bright red. This scene could've been erased from the film, but the way it's done will cause you to remember. This film contains one of the most uplifting and amazing stories ever set to film, with amazing acting, and (most importantly, I think) it's entertaining. Is it the 9th best film ever made? I don't know about that. Is it one of the hundred most important films ever made? No. It's probablyone of the fifty most important films ever made. <br /> <br />GRADE: A
B00005JLEU|5.0|I can't add anything that hasn't already been said.  I just want to add my voice to the chorus of fans.  This film always leaves me feeling warm and happy.  Love it.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|Perhaps I didn't dig deep enough in your site, but I can't believe I didn't read any reviews regarding this unit's battery problems. 98% of all the owner experiences I've read are the same, including mine:  works great for a few weeks then the battery dies.  You need to have a no star category in your ratings.  If there's someone out there who's had their machine for some time and it still works great, run right out and buy a lottery ticket.  If you bought your last week, hang in there and get back to me.
B000H305U0|5.0|When I first heard SexyBack I couldn't believe it was Justin Timberlake singing!  Well, I fell in love with that song immediately and now love this album.  It is unique and very modern.  I enjoy the music and his lyrics.   <br /> <br />My favorite songs are What Goes Around (comparable to Cry Me A River), LoveStoned (like the lyrics...\\"She looks like a model, except she's got a little more *ss), and of course SexyBack (just a hot track).   <br /> <br />Also check out:  Sexy Ladies Let Me Talk To You, FutureSexLoveSound, (Another Song) All Over Again, and really they are all decently good in my opinion.  Some might require a few listens to grow on you but some are just HOT! <br /> <br />Buy this album and make it number one on Billboard again!
0061150142|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book and it definitely held my interest.  There were a few times where I felt some of the character's reactions were unrealistic to what was going on in the story; however, it was part of what kept the suspense going. For example you know where you watch a movie and you keep saying to yourself, \\"Why don't they just (fill in the blank) and they'd get some answers?\\"  But I guess that's what make it suspense.  All in all, I enjoyed it.
B000H305U0|1.0|I believe in Justin's talent, but I think \\"Justified\\" has alot more solidity in terms of the sound and it was a pleasure to listen to.This is the same song played over and over again, with too much of a harsh electronic sound overall. I really dislike it.I agree with one viewer who gave it a bunch of zzzzzz's. He could have knocked our socks off but hasn't.
B00068TJM6|4.0|Fine print on the watch dials, thats about the only headache... Other than that, this piece came in only a week ago... no cuts or bruises on the wrist, and have realised I require reading glasses to read the manual and read what happens inside the watch. <br />Amazon delivered it within the time frame that I got while ordering the watch, intact. The finish is excellent, the strap is sturdy and watch gets noticed. Will finish the manual, figure out the alarm and the dual time business in a bit. More later.
B00003CX95|5.0|I thought the picture was fine.  Sound quality is very good and I was able to see all of the fights with blood and guts flying everywhere just fine.  I would like see a special edition though but making of's and a documentary on how a film was made, those types of special features are just getting boring.  Maybe you are looking for a blu-ray version of it but I have seen too many problems with these hi-def dvd's.  This DVD is cheap and is more than worth it.  I also found the behind the scene's and commentary from Mel Gibson very enjoyable.
B000F7CMRM|1.0|This film is boring, so much so that I could only take 35 minutes of it before I was forced to push stop. This is a soap opera about politics & oil companies. It's weird jump around style is confusing & pointless...do yourself a favor and don't bother w/ this garbage.
B0000025RI|5.0|I was already a fan of Mike and the Jacksons, But when Motown 25 came on in 83, this guy set the standard for what music and performance could be and where it could go. Till this day in my lifetime that one performance at Motown 25 is the single most perfect performance I've ever seen. I remember the next day at school and the next month after that performance we had all kind of talent shows where all of the kids were trying to out moonwalk each other. The saddest and funniest part was watching the less fortunate kids who could not afford the Michael gear wearing tube socks with dress shoes and kids making home made glitter and rhinestone gloves. Hilarious. As an adult, I refuse to let the media and even Michael himself ruin my childhood memories of this untouchable piece of music.    24 years later Thriller remains the album to beat!
0743455967|5.0|So you've finally come to it: you wake up in the morning, and decide to heck with this nine to five job, bills, and a squinty-eyed boss that smells like old tobacco - you want something better out of life. You've decided to do what you always wanted to do; become a writer, and create worlds and whole universes for a living.<br /><br />  Great. Now what?<br /><br />  After such a momentous decision - and a hearty breakfast of course, writing is hard work after all, requiring a satisfied stomach - you sit down in front of your Dell, Gateway, or Apple Ibook, open Word, and begin work on the masterpiece that will make millions, stun the world, and turn your name into a household word over night.<br /><br />  After five paragraphs, three writing breaks, four plot changes and the inevitable writer's block, you're faced with the daunting reality that writing something coherent - much less a best-selling novel - is a lot harder than you thought.<br /><br />  On a burst of inspiration, you troll down to the local Barnes & Noble and find your way to the Self-Help aisle, in search of Writing Bestselling Novels for Dummies. What you encounter is a dizzying array of \\"how to write novels\\" - how to write in every genre known to man; how to write the short story, novel, novella, poetry, market your book, make an author website, and sell your book.<br /><br />  You grab a whole armful, settle down in one of those nice comfy chairs by the coffee shop, get a cappuccino and donut, and plug away.<br /><br />  Ten minutes later, the drink and the pastry were great: but now what? Most of these books are boring, hard to read, and leave you no closer to your publication dreams than before.<br /><br />  With the exception of such fine tomes as the Literary Marketplace, toss all those others in the trash. If you're looking to learn more about the craft of writing and the writing world, look no further than On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft, by fiction great Stephen King.<br /><br />  On Writing succeeds were so many writing \\"how-to\\" books fail: it focuses first on the `why' and the passion of writing.  It does spend some time on technical issues - its advice on grammar, characterization and plot is top notch - but the memoir's main focus is the soul of writing itself.<br /><br />  In usual King fashion, On Writing seamlessly interweaves snapshots of Stephen King's life with the development of his craft, and while acknowledging his own success, he avoids positioning himself as a master who knows all the answers, but rather as a storyteller willing to share all he knows about telling stories to those who would listen.<br /><br />  On Writing is also unflinchingly direct: there is no \\"push-button\\" answer to literary success, no set-in-stone \\"path to publication\\". The process is equal parts hard work, dedication, and uncontrollable, often unpredictable doors of opportunity.<br /><br />  King's approach is casual, realistic, irreverent and many times knee-slappingly funny.  At times his language is coarse, but if overlooked, what he's given us is invaluable: an inside look into what makes him `tick' as a writer, and an invitation - perhaps even a challenge - to look inside ourselves for the same things.<br /><br />  So leave the \\"How to Write the Western\\" to others, get the cappuccino and donut to go, and order On Writing from Amazon.com or Barnes & Noble. Go home, enjoy - in some parts wince or grimace in empathy - the life of Stephen King, and begin writing what's lurking inside of you.<br /><br />5 out of 5 stars<br /><br />For more reviews, please visit &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">The Bookshelf Reviews&lt;/a>.Writing: A Memoir of the Craft, by fiction great Stephen King. <br /> <br />            On Writing succeeds were so many writing \\"how-to\\" books fail: it focuses first on the `why' and the passion of writing.

B00005AQE8|5.0|Having been released from prison just months earlier, Pac dropped one of the most anticipated rap albums in history and does not disappoint. For this brief period while he was alive, Pac really was untouchable. With renewed vigor and vengence, Pac took his lyrical assault with foes and the authorities to another level. The joint starts off with Ambitions of a Rider produced by Daz, which is probably one the most hardest first songs on a album ever. The cd just bangs till the end. Fav's are All about you, Got my Mind Made up, Picture me rollin, Thug Passion, Check Out Time, Cant See Me, California Love and All Eyez on me.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|If you love the sound of John Mayer, you'll completely enjoy this CD and then some.  I can be in a lousy mood, and put on his music and it takes me to a much finer place.. this CD does that and it won't disappoint..Absolutely 5 stars
B000002UJQ|5.0|I dont pretend Yorke is God but i like Radiohead.  I loved OK Computer, I liked The Bends and Hail To The Theif, I could tolerate Kid A, and I despised Amnesiac and Pablo Honey. <br /> <br />I do indeed give Radiohead some due ... although I will admit it sounds like Thom Yorke is on drugs.  And for all you haters who say you like rock ... please listen to Electioneering; it is an amazing straight up rock song that is honestly one of my favorite songs ever. <br /> <br />Also people must admit that there is something to be said for music with meaning and artistic value ... as opposed to Fall Out Boy.  Overall a great album ... only somewhat accessible, but listen to Electioneering. I also love Airbag and Karma Police. <br /> <br />Overall - 5/5
B000002HJA|4.0|I loved \\"Blues for the Red Sun\\" and \\"Welcome to Sky Valley.\\"   While \\"...And the Circus Leaves Town\\" did not immediately strike me as a great album, it slowly grew on me through repeated listens and, over time, it has racked up more plays on my i-pod than either of those albums.  Over two years later, I still find myself appreciating it in new ways.      It is initially difficult to appreciate Circus because it doesn't really sound like a Kyuss album in several respects.   In place of sprawling, \\"Freedom Run\\" style epics, Circus is basically a collection of medium length grooves.  Even the 11 minute album closer plays more like a medley of short riff jams than a through composed epic.  Meanwhile, the band's trademark organic guitar voices are replaced with a thick, beefy growl that foreshadows the early QOTSA \\"robot rock\\" sound.  On the vocals, John Garcia sings as much as he snarls.  And his lyrics eschew the awesome ego tripping bombast of Gardenia and Green Machine for something a lot moodier and more  complex.  Taken together, these changes create an overall feel that is very different from both earlier Kyuss albums and the early QOTSA output that followed.      The basic idea of \\"Circus,\\" as I interpret it, is that Kyuss puts away the bag of tricks they could have easily used over and over again (I think that is what is meant by \\"the Circus\\") and engages the listener on a much humbler level.  There is still considerable grandeur in this album, but it is not a grandeur that says \\"I am great.\\"   It is the grandeur of being small and human, doubting oneself and marveling at the greatness around oneself.  In the Yawning Man cover Catamaran, John Garcia sings \\"smooth stones behind me / cold air surrounds / soft and savory / it can take you to God.\\"  I think that about sums it up.
0060931671|5.0|You may not like THE CRYING OF LOT 49; you may find it complicated, difficult, or impossible to understand; but all serious readers of modern literature should read Pynchon's masterpiece.<br /><br />The other reviews have summarized the story and certain original facets of the book.  But this work needs to be consumed to be experienced.  I can't even imagine successful cliff notes.<br /><br />I recently re-read it and found new and exciting aspects during this third reading.  I would not recommend it for a pleasure read, or for any entertainment aspect, but nonetheless, it is a must read.
0142000663|5.0|As many reviewers have noted, I had a difficult time getting started with the dialogue in the book. Once I got used to it I realized how imperative it was to the story.  Stick with it past the first few chapters and you will see the light!<br /><br />The characters in this book are simply put \\"inspiring\\"! As a mother, I found it impossible NOT to draw strength and purpose from Ma Joad. This is a fantastic, emotional read and worth every second.  I doubt that there are authors of this caliber anymore.<br /><br />The ending was unexpected and gut wrenching, but oh so appropriate!  I want so badly to know what happens to the Joad family.  (The sign of a good book when it leaves you wanting more!)<br /><br />If you like the premise of this book, try reading \\"The Good Earth\\" by Pearl Buck.<br /><br />John Steinbeck, wherever you are, I salute you.
0790729393|4.0|The debate over whether or not this film portrays actual events is really moot to me, for even if the events portrayed were as faux as an episode of `Law & Order' they would still hold a very powerful message in their hands.  Adapted from Lorenzo Carcaterra's novel/memoir of the same name, `Sleepers' claims to be an accounting of Lorenzo's life as a child, being sent to a juvenile detention home at a young age with three friends and being repeatedly abused by the guards until their release.  <br /> <br />Ten years later and these four friends are reunited with the guard that ruined their lives.  Sean Nokes (Bacon) shows up at a local diner where two of the molested, Tommy (Crudup) and John (Eldard), are taking a couple drinks.  After recognizing this man they kill him in cold blood, and of course are then arrested for it.  That's when the other two boys, Lorenzo (Patrick) and Michael (Pitt) decide to make their case.  Michael is a high profile prosecutor who takes the case AGAINST his friends in an attempt to turn the tables on the detention center the boys where abused in. <br /> <br />What makes this film so compelling is the brilliant acting on the parts of Pitt and Patrick as well as Bacon in all his sadistic pleasure, but to me it was De Niro who plays the boys priest Father Bobby and serves as their only real friend who moved me the most.  You could see all the pain in his eyes as he heard what these boys, these boys whom he loved and cared about, had to go through.  Minnie Driver also delivered a stand out performance as long time friend and lover to the boys, as well as Dustin Hoffman (always brilliant) as the accused shabby lawyer. <br /> <br />True or false, `Sleepers' is still a gripping courtroom drama that is sure to have you at the edge of your seat for its entire duration.
0684801558|4.0|I recently went to see Gatz, the wonderful adaptation of Gatsby by the Elevator Repair Service, and it inspired me to go back to Fitzgerald's body of work. I had read all the major the major works except for The Beautiful and Damned, and I decided to remedy that gap.<br /><br />The Beautiful and Damned is an interesting book-- I probably liked it the least of all the Fitzgerald works, but I like his work enough that this is far from a bad thing. I could have lived without the overly obvious moralizing genaralities, but Fitzgerald himself recognized that this book had been written in too much of a hurry.<br /><br />The major strength of the novel is, of course, the characters. We have all known versions of Gloria and Anthony Patch. We went to college with them. They were the social butterflies who seemed to have no worries, no weaknesses, and no real cares. We all assume that somewhere along the way they had to have stopped partying and found something to do-- you cannot imagine these people at 30. The Beautiful and Damned is something about what happens when the butterflies of the world keep going well past the point of excusable youthful mistakes.<br /><br />People who already enjoy Fitzgerald should give The Beautiful and the Damned a read. It is certainly no Great Gatsby, but still contains much of the style and talent that made Fitzgerald so justly famous. Pay particular attention to the language and the turn of the phrase-- even in his lesser works, Fitzgerald is unparalleled at his particular kind of style.
B000GFLE86|4.0|There are those who'll dismiss Madeleine Peyroux as just another Billie Holliday wannabe - and those are the people who just don't 'get' what a wonderful artist Madeleine Peyroux really is.  Madeleine is unique and cannot be pigeon-holed into one genre, or another.  She is what she is:  one of the best song interpreters we have today.  Her vocals carry you to a serene state of mind.  Stand out tracks include \\"Everybody's Talkin'\\" \\"Once In a While\\" and \\"Half the Perfect World,\\" but the real stunner here is the introspective duet by Madeleine and K.D.Lang on Joni Mitchell's \\"River.\\"
0375703861|5.0|It was in the last year of the Second World War, while serving together as part of a tank crew, that Archie Jones met Samad Iqbal. What resulted is a powerful but wacky bond between the hapless but easy going Englishman and the better educated, but always underemployed and bitter, Bengali Muslim. This close friendship also brought together their wives: Alsana, who was promised by her family at birth to marry Samad, and Clara, an extremely beautiful Jamaican girl from a Jehovah's Witness family, whose one flaw is that she has no upper front teeth. 18 years old Clara married the much older Archie soon after meeting the middle-aged man at a hippie New Year's Eve party she was attending. Archie crashed the party after deciding not to go through with a suicide over his failed marriage to his Italian warbride.<br /><br />Naturally affected by the conflictive and dysfunctional marriages of these two couples are their children. Irie, the only child of Archie and Clara, is an intelligent and pretty girl, unfortunately insecure not only about her weight but also for the kinky hair she's inherited from her black mother. Irie has long been infatuated with one of Samad's twin sons, Millat, who has always been attracted to white women with long straight hair. Millat and his twin, Magid, are handsome like their father. Samad, however, was hypocritically displeased over the way the boys were growing up in 1970s Britain. Whereas Samad has always been joined at the hip of his English best friend (with whom he indulges in drink and an occasional dish of pork), and, at the time, was having an affair with his sons' red-headed English music teacher, he wanted his sons to be brought up as good Muslims, praying five times a day, eating halal food and all the rest. His solution was to send them to be raised in his native Bangladesh. Arranging this behind his wife's back, he found that he could afford to send only one of the boys. He chose the more intellectually gifted, and older by two minutes, Magid. Ironically it is this son who will grow into an atheist, loving all things English, while Millat, who remained behind in the UK, will eventually become involved with a radical Islamist group. Adding more into this already bizarre interracial and multicultural mix, Irie and Millat bring their fellow student, Joshua Chalfen, and his pretentiously intellectual, secular Jewish family --a brood that is overbearing and more dysfunctional than either the Joneses or the Iqbals could ever be-- into everyone's lives.<br /><br />All parties will eventually clash over the genetic engineering experiments of Josh Chalfen's father. Clara's Jehovah's Witness mother and ex-boyfriend, Millat's radical Muslim organization, all agree on one thing only: that Professor Chalfen is evil incarnate. Even his son Josh, who has become involved with a fanatical animal rights group, repudiates both him and his work. Only Magid, returning to his beloved England, is enamored with Professor Chalfen and his research.<br /><br />Zadie Smith was only 24 when she wrote WHITE TEETH. Herself the child of a black mother and white father, Smith had based much of the novel's storyline and characters from her own life's experiences (Interestlingly, the characters of Magid and Millat are based on real-life brothers Zia and Jimmi Rahman, Zia being the ex-boyfriend of writer Claire Berlinski [LOOSE LIPS, MENACE IN EUROPE]). Along with a knack for fueling the narrative, Smith also possesses that rare talent for putting the conversational --with all of its strange vernaculars and colloquialisms-- to print. The characters who populate her story, despite their wildest eccentricities and convoluted personalites, are realistic and attractive, easily provoking sympathy. WHITE TEETH is one of the few books that a reader hates to put down and can't wait to pick up again with any bit of free time he or she gets.<br /><br />There are, however, two things that I didn't like about WHITE TEETH: One is the way that Smith downplayed the racial tensions and often violent confrontations between the Indian and black immigrants and the white working class community in 1960s-1980s Britain. After all, at the time Samad is supposed to have moved to the UK (1975), so-called \\"Paki bashing\\" was still a common, late night pastime for many of England's white youth subcultures ('skinheads,' 'bootboys,' and other football hooligans, as well as the perrenial 'teddy boys'). The children, growing up in early-to-mid '80s London, not once encountered anything of the skinhead resurgence of that time, or the rise in popularity amongst white youth for the fascistic National Front or British Movement organizations. The Riots of 1981, which plagued the British Isles for weeks, aren't even mentioned. The other thing that displeased me about the story was the ending.

B000BBOUU4|2.0|Random reactions: <br /> <br />It's odd that the old film was named \\"Willy Wonka\\" but almost all the emphasis was on Charlie, while this new film is named \\"Charlie\\" and almost all the emphasis is on Willy Wonka. Who is the intended audience? Who is supposed to identify with who, up on the screen? <br /> <br />The personalities of the other (nasty) children were more fully sketched out and colorful in the Wilder film, especially Veruca Salt (who even got her own memorable song, \\"I Want It Now\\"). The nasty children in this film are paper cut-outs, and the young actress who plays the new Veruca just doesn't come close. They just exist to be sucked up, scooped, shrunk,dragged down a garbage chute by maniac squirrels, or whatever other sadistic way Roald Dahl thought of to express his hatred of children.  <br /> <br />The boy that plays Charlie seems too introverted and morose, though at least he has normal-looking boy hair; not that strange, giant poofy hair they inflicted on the first Charlie Bucket. <br /> <br />I don't see why Wonka had to be given an elaborate psychological back-story (involving a towering and octogenarian dentist dad played by Christopher Lee) about why he loves candy. It seems so 80's-ish, and so Oprah. It reminds me of Ron Howard's GRINCH -- another light fantasy character that got heavy self-esteem psychology hung all over him. <br /> <br />The songs are a big part of what helps peg the old film in your memory. They clarified characters and added fun.  There are no characterization songs in this film, and none of the songs sung by Deep Roy (starring as one of millions of Oompa-Loompas) are memorable, except maybe the bit about Augustus Gloop not being harmed... <br /> <br />Given our modern problems and horrible scandals, having Willy Wonka portrayed as an effeminate, emotionally arrested man-child in girlish clothes, bangs, and red lipstick who goes into memory-flashback spasms was off-putting to say the least. What sane parent would put theirchild in this man's hands for a tour of anything? Why is lipstick Willy so interested in young, sad Charlie...?  It's creepy, if you push past the graphics. <br /> <br />I think a parent will react to this film differently than a single person. <br /> <br />
0441009425|5.0|cant believe some of the bad reviews on this one! It does take a little time to get into but once you are there it is completely amazing. the nostalgia for infinity is one of sf's best star ships of all times and I think the characters are quite amazing. a classic work and a fine job for the first novel.

Bruce Campbell plays Ash better than ever, delivering many a classic line and owning the screen. The special effects are awesome, and the film as a whole is timeless. A must have.
B000GFLE1S|3.0|Despite the titillating title, this 2006 only-in-England comedy is quite lackluster and drags (pardon the pun) quite a bit for the first third of its seemingly lengthy 107-minute running time. Directing his first feature film, Julian Jarrold certainly captures the economic woes of Northampton, an industrial town in the Midlands, but he lacks the nimble finesse to make the farcical elements of this true-life story work within that context. The movie wants to be a hybrid of [[ASIN:B000M341RI The Full Monty]], [[ASIN:B000OPOAKC The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert]] and yet another variation on [[ASIN:B0006GAO5Y Rocky]], but frankly lacks the depth of any of them.<br /><br />Co-written by Geoff Deane and Tim Firth, the story focuses on Charlie Price, who inherits his family's shoe factory when his father dies. Bound for London and soon to be wed, Charlie seems ill-equipped to run it, especially as dwindling sales and mounting inventory force him to make layoffs. While in London, he saves a drag queen named Lola from some gay-bashers. Lola's inability to save her heel sparks an idea, spurred on by a pert, resourceful worker named Lauren, to have the factory manufacture thigh-high stiletto-heeled boots for transvestites and S&M lovers, apparently enough of a market to keep the company afloat. Designed by the multi-talented Lola, the boots are flashy, Ziggy Stardust-style concoctions with a convenient sheath to hold a disciplinary riding crop. The film's climax takes place during Milan Fashion Week where Charlie gets to expose his new line to potential buyers and the fashion media.<br /><br />Looking like a cross between Albert Finney circa [[ASIN:B000AP04MO Two for the Road]] and Conan O'Brien, Australian actor Joel Edgerton is rather tepid as Charlie, barely sustaining interest in a character that goes through a number of lightning-quick transformations through the film. The versatile Chiwetel Ejiofor ([[ASIN:B000GFLKF8 Inside Man]], [[ASIN:B000AM6P2U Melinda and Melinda]]) plays Lola with a hearty abandon and provides most of the film's energy, though the character's backstory seems unnecessarily clich&eacute;d. Moreover, he doesn't seem to regale in his variety performances enough to warrant being a paid stage entertainer. Sarah-Jane Potts has that early Kate Beckinsale winsomeness going for her as Lauren, but pouty-lipped Jemima Rooper gets more scenery to chew as Charlie's errant wife Nicola.<br /><br />The movie feels dormant for about forty minutes, at which point the factory workers start producing the boots and the action accelerates accordingly. A late plot turn involving Charlie's ignorance of Lola's reasons behind his cross-dressing seems contrived, though it was obviously designed for the flashy finish and big life lessons. The 2006 DVD has a standard set of extras - four deleted scenes with optional director commentary; a fifteen-minute making-of featurette; an odd, one-minute short (\\"Journey of the Brogue\\") about the making of a shoe; and an alternate commentary track with Jarrold, Edgerton, Ejiofor and Potts congenially participating.) plays Lola with a hearty abandon and provides most of the film's energy, though the character's backstory seems unnecessarily clichéd.

B00005R24K|5.0|Even though it seems cheesy, even laughable today, there's no denying \\"The Evil Dead\\" is still a landmark moment in the horror genre. Made for virtually no budget by a group of struggling young filmmakers straight out of college, \\"The Evil Dead\\" became one of the most original films in the horror genre as well as films in general, and is still vastly entertaining today.<br /><br />Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) and his friends have gone upstate to rent a cabin in the woods. Everything seems well at first until they find the so called Book Of The Dead, which is supposed to unleash unspeakable evil. That unspeakable evil is manages to one by one, turn each cabin dweller into mindless, bloodthirsty zombies, until Ash is the only one left standing.<br /><br />The plot is pretty much that, but it's still a thrill to watch. The death scenes are both hilarious and creative, and the performances are great, especially Campbell, who became a cult icon thanks to his performance as Ash.<br /><br />This new special edition comes with a wealth of special features, including audio commentary from the stars and the crew (including director Sam Raimi), and crystal clear sound and picture quality.<br /><br />An absolute must have.
B000059HB7|5.0|From the opening credits until the climactic confrontation at the end, this movie has the `feel' of a great Western.  The tale is simple and relatively small in scope.  A small town sheriff (played by John Wayne) and his ragtag groups of deputies and assistants (including Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, and Walter Brennan) must hold a man (Claude Akins) arrested for murder in the town jail until the US Marshal arrives.  Akins' brother, played admirably by John Russell, and his gang of ruffians will stop at nothing to break him out.  Ward Bond, another longtime filmmate of Wayne's, also has a minor role.  Angie Dickinson plays the love interest.  This is a film about atmosphere and the interaction between the characters, not action, and is filled with multiple subplots.  This film has the `feel' of the Old West, perhaps not as it really was, but as it should have been.  The main line of the story progresses slowly, so if you are ADHD and can only keep interested with lots of gunfights and explosions, this film is probably not for you.  Dean Martin's character is a recovering alcoholic and trying to become the man he once was.  Wayne's character, while trying to hold his prisoner, is becoming entangled in a relationship with Angie Dickinson.  It is really the development of these subplots and the relationships between the characters that make this film so memorable.  One of the other reviewers states that this film is easy to watch, and I would agree.  I can watch this movie over and over, and if you like Westerns with atmosphere, I think you will too.
B00007AJGH|5.0|\\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" is quite simply a most magical filmmaking experience. It's a film that is truly brilliant in every way imaginable. From its plot, a brilliant homage to the great film noir thrillers of the 1940s', to the fantastic visuals, still impressive even today, to its smart, funny, fast paced script, \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" is a truly timeless piece of cinema.<br /><br />Taking place in 1947, Detective Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) is a hard boiled Hollywood private eye haunted by his past. He has gone from a well respected cop, to a brutal, booze swilling drunk. When Marvin Acme, owner of Acme Gag Factory and head of Toontown, is murdered, the prime suspect is Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer), Toontown's most famous star. Desparate to prove his innocence, Roger enlists Valiant for help, and manages to drive Valiant nuts. This doesn't sit well with the power hungry Judge Doom (a frighteningly brilliant Christopher Lloyd), who is intent on bringing Roger to justice. As Roger's innocence becomes more apparent, so does Doom's plot to destroy Toontown and turn it into a freeway (an homage to \\"Chinatown\\"). It is up to Valiant and Roger to save Toontown from total chaos. Not that these two are working alone: Valiant's on again, off again gal Dolores (Joanna Cassidy) helps out, and then of course their's Roger's mindbustingly sexy wife, Jessica (voiced like no other by Kathleen Turner, who imbues the character with such a vibrant amount of sex appeal that once can't help but fall in love with her, despite the fact that she's a cartoon).<br /><br />As I said, this is an absolutely brilliant piece of cinema, and it now looks even better on this special edition dvd, which is loaded with two discs worth of bonus features as well as superb picture and sound remastering job. This is a truly amazing movie that belongs in anyone's collection.
B000HEWEEE|5.0|At first I wasn't going to see this movie.  It sounded stupid and I couldn't see how they would make it work. I was in for a pleasant surprise when I went to see the movie. The 2 year gap was done perfectly and I love the chemistry between Reeves and Bullock.  I loved it so much that I couldn't wait to see it again but unfortunately it was already gone from movie theaters.  Now, I have been waiting for it to come out on DVD so I can own it and watch it whenever I feel like it.  Much better than other chick flicks of the year like \\"The Break Up\\" or \\"Failure to Launch\\".  They pale in comparison to \\"The Lake House\\".
0743298020|2.0|This book fails to add up, time and time again.  Vida Winter is a famous author who is notorious for lying about her personal life.  Everyone knows this.  She summons Margaret Lea, an unknown, to write her biography.  Margaret isn't stupid though, she goes armed with three questions to ask Miss Winter.  She'll check the answers she is given as a test to make sure Miss Winter is not lying.  Excellent idea, Margaret!  However, what happens?  Well, Miss Winter answers the questions.  Does Margaret then leave to check and make sure Miss Winter isn't lying and Margaret isn't wasting her time with some tale spinning old woman?  No.  Instead Margaret stays and takes dictation from this woman for an entire week before she goes to check the facts.  I don't understand. <br /> <br />This is written in a classic style and points must be given out for that.  Overall though, this just entirely misses the mark of being compelling. As I stated earlier, it just doesn't add up.  This book has received a lot of publicity.  It's called advertising folks and only goes to show you a publisher isn't very choosey about which books to lay money on.  I had to bail on the Thirteenth Tale.    <br />

B00005JNNZ|4.0|This film, based on the real life accomplishments of Coach Ken Carter and his Richmond high school basketball team in 1999, makes a telling point about our inner city school system, which is steadily losing students to the temptations and easy alternatives of the street life. When Coach Carter boycotted his team from playing basketball due to low grades, the parents and the school board and staff withheld their support. A lot of them even actively opposed him. What does that say about our society when basketball has become more important than educating our kids? In the shoes of the parents, mired in a hopeless, embattled way of life, trapped in economic hell and without much to look forward to except for an NBA contract, I'm not sure whose side I would've picked. With an undefeated team to rally the community, with kids showing up at school, even it it's just to play ball, with an awareness that reaching for your dreams is unrealistic and too costly, the Richmond populace labeled Coach Carter more as a controversial troublemaker than a visionary with an eye on the big picture.<br /><br />Coach Carter tells the story of Ken Carter, who came to coach the down-and-out high school basketball team of Richmond, California, where he was an all-star player 30 years ago, setting records for scoring, assists, and steals. Already a successful shopowner, Carter took the job with more in mind than merely winning basketball games. He made his angry and undisciplined players each sign a contract stating that they must maintain a 2.3 grade school average, show up in classes, sit at the head of these classes, and wear a button shirt, tie, and jacket on game day. Thru strenuous workouts, drills, and game practices, Coach Carter taught his kids the art of teamwork and instilled in them a sense of worth and confidence. From a prior year's record of 4-22, the Richmond Oilers improved to an undefeated 16-0 before Carter finally got his hands on his kids' school progress reports (yes, it took 16 games before the uncooperative teachers began turning them in). When these reports revealed that the players haven't lived up to their contracts, Coach Carter closed down all basketball activities. Refusing to compromise, despite the outcry from the Richmond community, Coach Carter forfeited the next few games. Only should the student-athletes improve their academics satisfactorily will they be able to compete in hoops again.<br /><br />This movie may be overlong at 136 minutes, but it's still an outstanding, energetic movie with a contemporary message. Samuel L. Jackson's presence, as always, demands your attention. The film is anchored by his commanding performance, as well as by some sincere acting efforts put out by the kids, with Rick Gonzalez (The Rookie, Pulse) particularly memorable as Timo Cruz, who more than any of the other kids, seems headed down the wrong road. R&B star Ashanti fares pretty well in a sensitively portrayed pregnancy subplot. Yeah, the script is hokey and rife with cliched inspirational speeches, but, because it's mostly Samuel Jackson selling them, we buy the hokum. The only really, really cheesy part has to do with Timo's \\"greatest fear\\" poetry recital to Coach Carter, which is worthy of massive eye rolling. One thing I wish the movie has more of are father-and-son scenes between Coach Carter and his son Damien, who plays for him. On the athletic side, the basketball sequences are shot effectively, with some moments of excitement. The cast, having gone thru 3 weeks of basketball camp, is convincing enough as hoopsters. The thing is, the majority of the movie goers is already aware that the Oilers were undefeated going into the lockout, so the only actual suspense to a game's outcome was in the post-lockout contests, especially the game versus St. Francis.<br /><br />The dvd is not what you'd call loaded though it boasts two featurettes \\"Coach Carter: The Man Behind the Movie\\" and \\"Fast Break at Richmond High\\" (about the rigoroushoops training undergone by the actors and extras), 6 deleted scenes, and the cool music video \\"Hope\\" by Twista and Faith Evans.<br /><br />I'm usually not into message movies, especially movies that pound their social commentary down your throat. But, when it's social commentary this entertaining, it's well worth checking out. And if you enjoy Coach Carter, then why not try out a sports movie that's out in the theaters right now, The Gridiron Gang, about another person who made a difference.hoops training undergone by the actors and extras), 6 deleted scenes, and the cool music video \\"Hope\\" by Twista and Faith Evans.<br /><br />I'm usually not into message movies, especially movies that pound their social commentary down your throat.

B000ASSDVA|4.0|After the great success of Ben Hur, the febrile imagination of screenwriters and filmmakers turned their absolute attention on epic themes. Anthony Mann would make two emblematic movies in this decade; this one and \\"The fall of the Empire Roman\\" with interesting results keeping in mind the arduous complexity of the narrative material.<br /><br />Charlton Heston once more, was required to star this highlight spectacle about the famous legend of the Cid. The saga is depicted with ravishing splendor, recreating admirable battle sequences. The presence of the alluring beauty of Sophie Loren was an additional hook to engage the great audiences, in her role of Gimena.<br /><br />Opulent and distinguished movie.

B000IJ79WU|3.0|If you were to combine the best elements of both Superman II and the Richard Donner cut into a single film, you would, by far, have the best Superman movie.<br /><br />As it stands, the Donner version has some great scenes that, unfortunately, never made it into the original version.  There are some differences, but I won't mention them here for those who have not seen it yet.  However, this version does not allow for as much character development as the original version does.  There are too many quick cuts from one scene to another.  In many ways, it's too short.  The strength of the original version was in its longer scenes and better acting takes by the cast.<br /><br />The Donner version could have filled some of the plot holes that were missing in the original cut had they been included.  Some of the extended scenes that I'd seen years ago on television are back in this version (such as the White House attack scene).<br /><br />You'll find that this version is slightly less than two hours from the nearly two and a half hours of the original version.  You'll find many scenes from the original cut are completely gone, such as the entire Paris sequence.  Many portions of the Niagra Falls scenes are also gone.  Unfortunately, these missing scenes take away much of the time needed for the viewer to really get into the Lois Lane and Clark Kent romance that buds and then takes off.  The romance works much better in the original version.<br /><br />There are also some changes in the still famous \\"Battle Over Metropolis.\\"  In some cases it works better, and in others, it takes important elements away.<br /><br />The sound effects are better and crisper in this version.  When a super-villain hits someone or something, it sounds like thunder, indicating real power.  The heat visions don't sound like lasers here, which I like better.<br /><br />The original film stands better as a complete picture.  I'm actually hoping that one day, someone will edit these two versions together for the truly ultimate Superman cinematic experience!these two versions together for the truly ultimate Superman cinematic experience!
B000007O9L|4.0|The song selection and \\"unplugged\\" vibe of this album is great, but it sounds kind of phoned in. I was hoping for something along the lines of Nirvana unplugged where the artist really strips down and exposes the raw, visceral, fragile, beautiful, and pure origin of his muse, or at least something approaching that. Instead this kind of sounds like the boys got together on the weekend, had a couple beers, maybe smoked a joint, just chilled out and threw down a jam. I mean it's The Stones; it's great, and the set list is incredibly delicious but the way it's being performed is more laid back and relaxed than immediate and vital. Highly recommended, highly enjoyable, but don't expect it to reveal any new layers of the material as it's being presented here.

1400034205|5.0|Probably an embellishment from a real life story Maugham witnessed, but at any rate a genuine pleasure to read.  It is so readable; Maugham writes simply and beautifully.  The only comment I wish to add to all the other reviews people have written is that parts of the story created the same atmosphere (Paris) which Swann's Way did, but in this book the ideas flowed so much more easily that they struck me as Proust's vision, except lubricated.
0393312836|5.0|I think it best to summarize the pros and cons of this book as an elaborate description is already provided by other reviewers. <br /> <br />Pros: In my opinion, the Nadsat slang was wonderful and added a fresh, raw atmosphere to the story but that might just be because I could ask my mother what the Russian-esqe words meant. In any case, they weren't impossible to decipher on my own. The character of Alex was also fascinating because I never found myself disliking him for his inhumane actions better yet nursing a hatred towards him. A Clockwork Orange flowed wonderfully and I had a hard time putting it down. Reflecting back on it, the reader may find that it is indeed, a rather amusing book. I've always admired writers who can make the reader connect with their characters and Burgess is no exception. <br /> <br />Cons: The last, original 21st chapter. I'm a bit of a cynic so the negative, evil-will-always-prevail complex is rather appealing and more realistic than the we-will-all-eventually-settle-down complex, oddly enough. I finished the 20th chapter with a satisfied smirk whereas I finished the 21st chapter with furrowed eyebrows and a dissapointed sigh. I felt that Alex's struggle throughout one half of the story was for nothing, and his character itself faded away as the pangs of responsiblity corrupted his rebellious mind.
B00005JNS0|5.0|This was a great movie.  The animation was top notch, both adults and children can be entertained by this film, and despite what some neysayers will tell you....there IS a story line.   Apparently the people that feel there is no story line couldn't grasp the simple message of \\"take life slow and enjoy\\".   The town of Radiator Springs used to be a hustle and bustle town.  But then a major freeway was opened up, which bypassed the town, saving commuters a mere 10 minutes.   We learned our lesson on our last road trip, we got off the main highway and took some alternate route, which lead us through small towns that we never saw from the main road. <br />And as for the length and whatnot, MY 2 YEAR OLD SAT THROUGH THE WHOLE THING!  He just sat there and watched the screen through the entire 90 some minute flick.    If an 8 year old can't sit through this, then maybe their parents should limit their sugar intake and video games in hopes to regain their attention span. <br />Overall, this is a GREAT movie.  Well put together, great messages behind it, lessons to be learned, and it is entertaining.   So don't listen to the negative comments because chances are, the neysayers have the attention span of a goldfish and couldn't understand the simple messages in the lessons Lightning McQueen learned: take life slow and enjoy, and that sometimes you need to think about others rather than yourself.
B0007Y89ZM|4.0|When hell freezes over the Eagles will reunite - well it sure did and the Eagles are consumate performers. Just goes to show, never say never. These guys were my favourite band ever right from the 70's and like a good wine still very consumable 25 years later.  The only reason why I didn't give this DVD a 5/5 rating was due to the MTV unplugged format and not due to the recording or the performance (which are indeed 100% 5 star, espcially the fantastic DTS mix).  Let's face it - the Eagles are nice, mellow and the vocal harmonies are out of this world, but there's not enough ROCK.  Don Felder does a lovely spanish guitar acoustic version of Hotel California (and his playing is really the MAIN reason you'd want this DVD) but it would've been nice if they done the \\"electric\\" version at the end too.  There is no official recording out there of Felder playing the electric version of HC avail on DVD - which is a total travesty - espcially as he has since left the band and won't be coming back.  (There is a great bootleg version, featuring Felder on the SG doubleneck. Teh concert also includes 'Victim of Love' - not on aly commerical release - recorded a year later in New Zealand, but it's not readily available).  Best track is \\"Life in the Fast Lane\\" - here they rock it up, right at the end, and you get to see the famously wonderful guitar interplay between Walsh and Felder work its magic.  For this DVD to have scored 5/5 it needed at least 5 or 6 more tracks just like this (I know 'One of These Nights' was done at the concerts - WHY, oh why, was it not included in the DVD?)  If you are new to Eagles had to buy only ONE Eagles DVD then this is one to get.  Farewell 1 (3 & 1/2 stars) has a more compreshensive playlist and is a double DVD - Joe Walsh is good in that too - but sadly Felder had left by then, so \\"boo hoo\\" to the totally mediocre version of Hotel California on it and the total lack of guitar interplay.  If you are an Eagles junkie - certainly add this to yourcollection, enjoy the \\"softer songs\\" and Take It Easy.  The boys were off the drugs and booze by then and playing really well!!!

B000FIMG68|5.0|If you watched season one, you don't need some clown like me to tell you to watch season two as the desire is already there. I am just here to tell you to indulge in your desire, you will not be sorry. <br /> <br />To those who say it falls short of season one, I say nay-nay. It builds beautifully and steadily upon it. The first few episodes do, in fact, repeat themselves simply to ensure you are up to speed on everyone's story-lines. Especially since this season introduces several more excellent characters with completely engrossing back stories. Once the \\"tailies\\" and the regualr cast meet, the show is off and running while staying on par with anything the fantastic first season had. <br /> <br />In fact, I would go as far to say that season two has one definitive thing over season one; better flashbacks. The scenes involving flashbacks won't have you waiting for them to get back to the island. Not that all of season one's did, but a select few flashbacks in season one were lackluster. I can't think of a single flashback in season two that was less than fully engrossing. <br /> <br />Do make sure you watch the bonus features, they are quite quite good. I am not a 'Lost Theorist' but hearing many of the theories and and creators thoughts on them are very interesting.  <br /> <br />Whatever your expectations going into this season, you will leave it the same way you did season one; begging for your next fix.
B00007LTIA|4.0|In 1973 two very iconic progressive rock albums would be realeased. One would be Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", the other \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\" by Yes. \\"Dark Side\\", a concept album about man's destructive qualities: (his wasting of time, his mental ills, his greed, etc). would be praised by critics, while \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\", a concept album about man's more positive qualities (his reverence of God, his respect for creation, and his wonderous ancient civilzations) would be spoken of rather harshly by the presses. I think that response says more about human nature than it does about the quality of the music on each of the records.     \\"Tales\\" isn't a perfect album, no, and it is a little stretched out at times, but when it's good (which is most of the time) it is a deeply evocative, beautiful piece of music, and a very special record, made all the more special by this re-release.    \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\" was a two record release, made up of four 20 minute songs. For this album we have Jon Anderson is on vocals, Chris Squire on bass, Rick Wakeman on keyboards, Steve Howe on guitar and Alan White (formerly a session man for John Lennon & George Harrison) on drums. It's a concept album inspired by what Jon Anderson calls a \\"lengthy footnote\\" on page 83 of Paramhansa Yoganada's \\"Autobiography of a Yogi\\". The lyrics deal with origins and memories, the wonders of nature, possibilities, places long ago, places far away and rituals. Whether the concept is full and complete, I'm not really sure, but I do enjoy the ride.    It took me a few listens to get into this album. Actually, the first time I played I fell asleep on my desk halfway through \\"The Revealing Science of God\\". It's not that it's a boring, far from it. It's just that some parts are atmospherically sparse, and the tracks all go for a while, and for a first listen (or even a second or a third) it's a lot to take in. There's not as many of the intense moments as you'll find on other 20 minute tracks like \\"Close to the Edge\\" or \\"The Gates of Delirium\\" (for Relayer). It's not exactly low tempo, but it doesn't get too high too often either. There are weird moments (especially in \\"The Ancient\\") but for the most part, it all sounds pretty normal. \\"It's typical Yes, just longer\\" as one of my friends puts it. There is a little repetition, but it doesn't get too over top. Well, I don't think so anyway.    For me, this record is really special. I don't know what it is exactly, but something in the chords or the lyrics, or both, evokes something ancient. Like when you see archaeological relics in a mueseum, or when you look at a rugged cliff face, or pass a gnarled tree, or watch clouds billow out in the sky. Those moments that suggest something beyond, profound and distant. I'm sure Yes felt this about the songs too, if not intended it to evoke such things, judging from their choice of cover (a Roger Dean painting with rugged rocks and ancient monuments), and the photographs of various natural beauties underneath where the CDs sit (various skylines and cloudscapes, rushing water, etc).    Speaking of packaging, Rhino have done a great job with this repackaging. It's done like a mini-LP sleeve, which folds out revealing the discs. In one of the folds is a picture of a young Steve Howe, standing in front of a \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\" billboard. The booklet, which you can find within between the fold with Steve & the billboard picture, has all the lyrics, a couple of pictures of the band, new liner notes by Mike Tiano describing the making of and controversy around the album, plus the original liner notes by Jon Anderson, describing the origins of the concept and a rough outline of the concept itself. The only problem I have with the packaging is that it doesn't fit on a standard CD rack. Agh! Ah well.    There's forty minutes of bonus tracks in the repackage too. That is, an alternate take each for two of the twenty minute tracks, \\"The Revealing Science of God\\" and \\"The Ancient\\". They are both early run throughs. A couple of the lyrics are different, but turn away from the stereo for a moment and you'll miss them. As they're run throughs, the productions a little more organic too (especially \\"The Ancient\\"), and there aren't as many harmonies, and a lot of the familiar overdub parts aren't there. Jon Anderson's vocals are a little rough, and it used to put me off listening to these outtakes, but listening to them now, it's interesting hearing him striving, working things out. He's really passionate about the material, you can tell. There's a couple of extended parts in the songs too. The most notable part of these run throughs, I would say, is the version of \\"Leaves of Green\\" at the end of \\"The Ancient\\". Rather than having a Spanish guitar as backing, Steve Howe plays an electric guitar, and Alan White provides a jerky beat, in addition to hitting/shaking a really wobbly piece of percussion, sounding kind of comical against Jon's sincere lyrics.    It's a great album, and one worth getting for Yes fans, but pick up three or four of their other classic era records (like \\"The Yes Album\\", \\"Fragile\\", \\"Close to the Edge\\", \\"Relayer\\", or \\"Going For the One\\") before getting this one, just to get into what Yes are all about. It will help with this one.
B000002UAI|4.0|So, you've just put your \\"heart & soul\\" into the stunningly effective music for your first film and your record company then says we need an album by Christmas. With less than six months to deliver the goods it's hardly surprising that \\"Beatles For Sale\\" is regarded as one of their lesser albums. But take a step back... how many groups, then or now, could compose, in such a short time, five classic tracks like \\"No Reply\\", \\"Eight Days a Week\\", \\"Every Little Thing\\", \\"Look What You're Doing\\" & \\"I'll Follow the Sun\\" while delivering, on the way, definitive versions of Buddy Holly's \\"Words of Love\\" and Chuck Berry's \\"Rock & Roll Music\\". Review it in context and it's incredible.
B000EYK2GE|5.0|If you want to enjoy the Rock Experience, then be sure to watch this video.  It is long past time this gem of October 1985 was released to dvd.  Carl Perkins, the man whom George Harrison admired since his boyhood was in the line up along with George, fellow former Beatle Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton and others.  Johnny & June Carter Cash and their music is always a treat, but this ensemble rocked the heck out of their song.<br /><br />Dave Edmonds, an established guitarist does not disappoint.  He and Perkins worked guitar magic on this show and you just never want them to stop!  Eric, a guitar icon does some intense playing that makes you want more!<br /><br />You knew very good and well Perkins was not about to leave the place without playing \\"Blue Suede Shoes.\\"  It is one helluva classic that will last for time immemorial.  He and Harrison are in no short supply of fun, energy and talent - this is a damn good collection!<br /><br />The CD is good, but the dvd is even better.  Get ready to rock your Blue Suede Shoes off or your Beatle Boots!  I just LOVE this one!
B000BTJDGM|4.0|Probably one of Laura Linney's most popular films to date, she shows her skills as emotionally and dramatically as possible without being too corny impeccably!  Tom Wilkinson plays great as a priest, and relatively new newcomer Jennifer Carpenter (suggested by Linney) is amazing.  You may have a hard time telling when slight special effects are used and when it's Carpenter performing some odd twist or contortion.  For her to practice this role, you can only imagine how many times she screamed in a day and how physically challenging this role may've been.  She was so perfect that she had scared cameramen into thinking that she really got demented.  Carpenter also had to speak in 6 different languages in one point of the movie, and it must have been difficult to pronounce the words correctly.  Campbell Scott does well as a modern Christian lawyer so to speak.  The director, Scott Derrickson, provides some interesting feedback on the movie as he says that one of his favorite scary films of all time had Campbell Scott's father in the movie, and Derrickson had no idea until after he picked Campbell Scott that the two are related.  Ironically, both actors played lawyers, so you can expect Scott's performance on this movie would be very fitting.  Shohreh Aghdashloo, who plays Dr. Adani, is another eye catcher even though her role is small.  Her role is very important to the movie as it helps give the case a necessary edge for the defense to have any kind of hope at all.  Her appearance and accent add to the movie to make it more intellectually stimulating.  As a courtroom horror film, this has probably hit a more unique genre.  It's composed well enough that the horror is not too corny, and the courtroom action does not get too boring unless you have little patience.  There is supposedly a play of colors in the movie in which orange represents terror, white supposedly has a different meaning, and green had a supposed meaning too.  There are also hard to notice nuances that you probably wouldn't notice unless you listened to the commentary such as Derrickson making a big deal about a yellow (or maybe blue?) brush in the background of a frame or a time when lawyer Erin Bruner (Linney) whispers to Father Moore (Wilkinson) rather than talks to him normally.  Some scenes were removed because Linney is allergic to cats, and some scenes were considered too gruesome to keep the film rated PG-13 surprisingly.  Many of the less well known actors/actresses to US people may be more well known in Canada as the film was shot in Vancouver, and many people came from more local locales to take parts.you probably wouldn't notice unless you listened to the commentary such as Derrickson making a big deal about a yellow (or maybe blue?) brush in the background of a frame or a time when lawyer Erin Bruner (Linney) whispers to Father Moore (Wilkinson) rather than talks to him normally.

B00005JO9J|1.0|I still can't believe this show gets acclaim for being \\"smart\\" and \\"original.\\"   <br />Smart?  There are so many things factually wrong with this show it's ridiculous.  Any hospital that lets INTERNS perform surgery right off the bat is not one I would want to go to.  It would never happen.  Would you get on a plane with a pilot that had studied flying, but never actually flown a plane?  No way.  Also, is it believable that an intern could diagnose someone that doctors with 15+ years of experience couldn't?  I don't think so.   <br />Original?  No.  Have any of you seen Scrubs?  Probably not.  If you did, you'd think this show was a remake.  Grey's Anatomy is narrated by the main character. Scrubs is narrated by the main character.  Watch the first few episodes of Grey's and on occasions you will hear Cynthia call George \\"Bambi\\", the same name Carla calls J.D. in Scrubs. Notice George;the goofy, messy brown haired, loveable doctor. Notice J.D.; the goofy, messy brown haired, loveable doctor. Notice Bailey; the coarse, scathing mean doctor, that's mean to teach the interns a lesson but really likes them and feels for them. Notice Cox; the coarse, scathing mean doctor, thats mean to teach the interns a lesson but really likes them and feels for them.  Grey's even steals music from Scrubs.   <br />It's painful to watch a Scrubs meets Melrose Place, far-fetched, ridiculous show like this gain the praise and ratings it so doesn't deserve.  I only wonder how long it will take the masses to realize how worthless this show is.
1400062071|4.0|Novelists, like high divers, should get extra points for degree of difficulty.  Elizabeth Strout set her first novel in a dying New England mill town. She took the story of a sullen teenager and her tightly-wound mother and made something special of it.  She pulls off another difficult maneuver in Abide with Me, which excavates the emotional lives of a Protestant congregation in rural Maine, a place where people pride themselves on keeping emotions buttoned down and zippered up.<br /><br />The year is 1959. Tyler Caskey, a minister in West Annett, Maine has recently lost his wife to cancer.  He's trying to get past his grief, dress and feed his two little girls, and tend to the needs of his congregation, but his efforts are getting as ragged as the cuffs of his dress shirts.  The book starts slowly, and it's hard at first to tell one taciturn member of Tyler's congregation from another.  About a third of the way in, a few faces start to separate out from the crowd:  the church deacon Charlie Austin, who hates his day-to-day life and escapes it by visiting a naughty lady down in Boston; Tyler's housekeeper Connie Hatch, who has a secret that's growing in her like a tumor; Rhonda Skillings, a school guidance counselor besotted with Freud's swirling sexual underworld.<br /><br />Tyler keeps turning over memories of his wife Lauren.  She taught him about love, but this girl from a well-to-do Boston family wasn't really cut out to be a small-town minister's wife.  The congregation, smitten with Tyler, never warmed up to Lauren.  As Tyler feels his faith slipping away, his zeal for his calling starts to diminish.  The congregation senses his withdrawal, and resents it. His daughter Katherine is acting out all over, and Tyler's not prepared to deal with it.  Connie Hatch finally reveals her secret, which precipitates several kinds of crisis.  Tyler and his congregation have to decide if they can continue forward together.<br /><br />This is a book that's easy to respect:  the folks of West Annett are finely rendered, their plights feel real, and the resolution is unexpected and satisfying.  But it's hard to warm up to these characters.  The concerns of the congregation seem selfish and small-minded.  For instance, it's not clear why so many congregants, including her kindergarten teacher and Sunday school teacher, have so little compassion for Tyler's daughter Katherine, a five year old who just lost her mother.  Tyler's own mother comes across as a cold-blooded bitch.  Tyler himself lacks that core of will you'd expect in a charismatic minister.  Admittedly we're seeing him during a bad time, but he's so passive that the reader, like his congregation, may start to lose patience with him.<br /><br />Pleasure comes from the superbly detailed setting, from the nuances of Tyler's thought as he explores the waxing and waning of his faith, and from the assurance with which the author gathers up the disparate plot strands and brings them together at the end of the book.  Strout's characters may not be visited by grace, but they certainly earn their hard-won conclusions.  They are moved by what happens in their small town, and you will be too.ect:  the folks of West Annett are finely rendered, their plights feel real, and the resolution is unexpected and satisfying.

B000FQJAIW|2.0|If you do not already own the star wars DVD's, then this is excellent for you, so ignore the reviews below, and get this, but most folks that will buy these already have them.      If you bought these, and own the other DVD's or VHS tapes, I hope you got them as cheap as I did (for the price of about one DVD).  These are barely worth anything over 12 bucks.  Why Lucas waisted the plastic to re-press the 2005 editions, I do not know.  He should have taken the time to make the old ones letter box or 16:9 so we can get the full screen shots again, so we can get a truely un-adultarted version of the theatrical version.  I, like many others, already have 2004 versions, and the 1995 version on vhs.  I wish he would have done the modifications as I listed above, released the versions as one disc, and then priced them to move (under 10 bucks).  I'm sure he'll see these reviews, and do that in about 2 years, so he can build another wing on his house, or buy an island in the pacific. It's too bad I had to sink and get these this way to have a DVD copy of the originals.
0061150142|5.0|This is the 3rd Picoult novel I've read this year. I find them very thought provoking and haunting (in a good way). This book was gripping (as were the other two: My Sister's Keeper and Vanishing Act). I'd certainly recommend it to anyone with teenaged children.
078322799X|5.0|I was pleasently surprised by this movie when I saw it on the bigscreen, and now I'm happy to have it in my collection.  Michael J Fox's role as a paranormal investigator/ghost trapper with Hired Help is just a very funny concept.  Chi Mcbrie's character I thought made this movie, great comic relief.  Jake Busey did a decent job at being a bad guy.  I have seen this probably 8 times, and still find it funny.  It holds me if I find it flipping through channels.  Nice one to have in the collection.  I only own the original version, worth investing into directors cut to see what has been added.<br /><br />Update 9/3/2008:  I now own the HD DVD directors cut version of this movie, and let me say, it toasts all previous releases of this movie.  It has 14 minutes of seamlessly added footage which does not detract from the storyline, greatly enhaced soundtrack, and an incredible picture that is second to none in clarity and effects, no film specles at all.  If you have HD DVD format, this disc alone makes it worth keeping, unless they can re-produce it on blu-ray.  Right there with other good HD DVD movies like Beuwulf in quality of film transfer.
B000002C1W|3.0|I am a huge Pink Floyd fan. Though I like some tracks like learning to fly, the entire album sound feels a little tired and synthetic. Lyrically it feels a bit prissy and commercial at times (it's like a polished facsimile of earlier PF works). The 'contemporary feel' that others talk about is precisely what I don't like about this album.  <br />I give it 3 stars out of 5.
B00009V7T2|5.0|And I don't even like prog-rock that much. There is such a devine space created by these guys though that I'm compelled to listen... over, and over, and over... you get the idea. I've also listened to Amputechture and Frances the Mute and for myself personally De-Loused is the go to album of these guys - the others seem a tad to overbearing and overindulgent (even prog-rock is supposed to represent these two ideologies). Somehow the inspiration of their friend's coma experience and subsequent death helps elevate this piece of material above the other two in my opinion. On a purely technical level, these guys have chops, the engineering makes perfect use of the stereo range, and the mastering job is one of the best and most natural that I've heard in a long time.
6304493681|1.0|This is an extremely dry anime.  The manga version by Masamune Shirow is filled with bits of humor.  Not so for the anime.  The character Batou was especially funny in the manga, but for reasons unknown he is the driest character in the already humorless anime version.  Expect long scenes filled with monotonous talking.  These really make the movie crawl.  One minute there's action, next you're listening to Matoko or Batou go on and on about existentialism.  Seriously, these little talks take up 3/4 of the movie.  The visuals are awesome, no question about that.  Even so, they do not fulfill the need for SOME kind of thread of a story.  Altogether, not much actually HAPPENS during the movie.  If you must see it, rent it first to be sure you want it.
B000059H98|4.0|I am a huge comic book fan.  I have been reading comic books since I was 7 (taught myself to read in English from comic books), and I have been a fan of the Tank Girl series since its inception.  My love and appreciation for well written, creative comic books tell me that I'm supposed to hate this movie.<br /><br />However, I am completely and unbashedly, illogically in love with this movie.<br /><br />What is a girl to do?<br /><br />This movie is corny, and it's cheesy (although, in my book, that's a GOOD thing), but it fits the twisted, choppy style of the comic book.  Lori Petty does a great job bringing the twisted Tank Girl to life and the spliced scenes from the comic makes me squeal like a little school girl.<br /><br />I can't explain it, but there is just something about this movie that makes me adore it above any other comic book adapation (with the exception of Barbarella).<br /><br />Humor me.  Pick up a copy and watch it.  You might find yourself embarassingly in love this movie as well.
B000F5GO0A|5.0|If you like Goran Bregovic or Johnny Cash or Roy Orbison or David Byrne or Mostar Sevdah Reunion or Zlatne Uste, you'll like this music; if you like all of the above, you'll love it. It's that simple. Indie crooning plus Balkan brass music. How come nobody ever thought of this before?
B00004WG2F|5.0|Marvelous movie, marvelous cast in this 1994 release.<br /><br />This blockbuster stars Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Julia Ormond, Aidan Quinn, and Henry Thomas. It's a tale of an early 1900's family - a father and his 3 sons - who live on a sprawling ranch. Youngest son Samuel, played by Henry Thomas, brings home his fiance, Susannah. His brothers, Alfred and Tristan - Aidan and Brad respectively, also fall under her spell. Anthony Hopkins is the patriarch of the family as Colonel Ludlow.<br /><br />The story itself is very good, weaving the characters in and out of passion and success, anguish, loss and acceptance. Off to war the brothers go, with an exceptionally unforgettable scene. Reunions are bittersweet and intense. That Susannah is loved by all three brothers is actually believable given the setting.<br /><br />Brad Pitt is at his intense sexiest in this movie, with long hair quite appropriate for the wildness of his character. Anthony Hopkins has always been a favorite of mine, and he doesn't disappoint in this one. Julia Ormond as Susannah is lovely and tragically enraptured with Tristan (Brad). It would be difficult not to be, and yet Aidan Quinn is attractive in his more civilized way. I had a little trouble initially accepting Henry Thomas as the groom-to-be when I still see his younger face crying as E.T. left to return home, but I must admit he gave a great performance here.
B000H5U65C|5.0|All I can tell anyone that is interested in purchasing this cd, GET IT NOW!!!!!! This indeed is the album of the decade and then some. It simply does not get any better than this. Mastodon is the best of the best. Leviathan is also a must, but for the love of music, get this, you will not be diappointed, I promise.
B000050FEN|4.0|This clever and gruesome film was released in theaters in 1995. Definitely not for the squeamish but if you can even try to peek through fingers, this movie will keep you riveted.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman is a soon to retire police investigator, who gets paired with a nearly-rookie, Brad Pitt. Our young hero is married to Gwyneth Paltrow. The idea is vaguely reminiscent of the Lethal Weapon duo but it's not a laughing matter. The crimes they are investigating are heinous, and point to a diabolical serial killer who has a penchant for rendering justice upon those who have committed the \\"seven deadly sins.\\" Kevin Spacey is particularly brilliant in his performance as the mad man, but all actors shine in this one creating a stark contrast with the gruesomeness. Nicely done.
B000GG4KTU|2.0|I was disappointed with this CD.  I feel that Diana Krall is not compatable with  a large orchestra, and that she exceeds her vocal range with missed pitch and odd manerisms in expressing the lyrics.  I feel that she is at her best with a small combo and her piano.  It is the intimate Diana Krall that I long for.  Will she come back?? <br />Warren Schrick
B00008973A|4.0|This is a 1985 release, and stars Michael Douglas as a Broadway director casting dancers for a large production. I enjoyed the movie, yet completely agree with others that the stage version is much better and makes more sense of the story line. Many people saw the stage version first. I do understand their frustration with the film; in particular, it skews the number \\"What I Did For Love\\" into emphasizing the love story between Cassie and Zach. What it's really about is the love and dedication dancers have for what they do, through all the blood, sweat and tears.<br /><br />I went out of order and saw the movie first, and wound up thoroughly enjoying the stage version, a positive experience last rather than the generally negative reception from those who sequenced the other way. Best strategy is to enjoy each, the stage version and film version, for what they are - entertainment.
B00065GX64|5.0|I don't want to dwell on the movie itself; there are more than enough reviews here to convince you of whether you want to own this movie or not.  <br /> <br />I just wanted to point out that the image quality of the movie is absolutely stunning, even for a Criterion disc. The clarity of the images far exceeds those on many DVDs I own of movies from the 40s and 50s. If you're a fan of classic black & white cinematography, this is one disc that belongs in your collection.

Written by Lua creator himself this book offers great walkthrough the Lua language, includes many useful examples and shows variety of important Lua coding ideoms that comprise so called \\"Lua programming style\\".

B00005R2IS|4.0|In the dystopian world of the future as seen through MAD MAX, the tough and crazy world we live in has become a lot rougher. Bandit gangs of motorcycle riders rule the roadways. They claim that anarchy and bedlam are the way to go. They steal cars, run over people, and rape women. The only thing stopping them from completely having their way is the Main Force Patrol (MFP), the last embodiment of law and order in the land. Driving vehicles full of swift and speed the MFP is the last line of defense in a world gone mad. The best member of the MFP is one Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) a cool officer with nerves of steel, a heart of gold, and a jewel of a sense of humor. Max succeeds in killing more thugs and bringing in more criminals than anyone else on the patrol. But even Max has his limits. After the death of a notorious criminal known as the Nightrider (Vincent Gil), his second-in-command takes over, Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and vows revenge. First they kill Max's partner and then they come for Max but kill his family instead. That puts Max over the edge and he doesn't just get even, he gets mad. At the end he drives away in his Interceptor and the legend of the Road Warrior begins.<br /><br />MAD MAX will always be known as the film that made Mel Gibson an international star. Until THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT it was also known as the motion picture with the highest cost-to-profit ration: the movie was made for less than $400,000 and earned well over $100 million. The shoe-string budget was even throughout the filming. For instance many of the cars used as police interceptors were constantly repainted for different scenes to pass as other cars and the blue van that is smashed in the opening car chase was writer and director George Miller's personal vehicle.<br /><br />The style of MAD MAX feels like BLADE RUNNER, but without all the cool gadgets. The world has fallen apart and each man must defend his own, but it's never explained why things are the way they are. Outside communication with the rest of the world has been completely cut off and though there are pockets of happiness to be discovered, one has to brave the roads and the roads are a dangerous and many times lethal place.<br /><br />The acting in MAD MAX isn't anything extraordinary, but it doesn't have to be. The movie has a solid script with several impressive car chases. The cheap budget helped grand the film in the bleak atmosphere it is portraying and gives it a grainy quality that is lacking in the other Mad Max films.<br /><br />I enjoyed MAD MAX and was quite impressed by how much the filmmakers were able to accomplish with so little. I think that ROAD WARRIOR (aka MAD MAX 2) is a better movie, but MAD MAX isn't a film to be messed with either.tside communication with the rest of the world has been completely cut off and though there are pockets of happiness to be discovered, one has to brave the roads and the roads are a dangerous and many times lethal place.<br /><br />The acting in MAD MAX isn't anything extraordinary, but it doesn't have to be.

068987474X|2.0|This is a very naive book.  It seems to state that if men want to call you, they'll call you, and if they don't, they're \\"just not that into you\\".  That's a catchy phrase, but it's not good advice in the dating world.  This book completely disregards the notion that a man, gasp, may be shy, may be weary of starting a relationship, may be protecting himself, etc., etc..  There's been many a man who are naturally shy, and may be just waiting for that woman to bring them out.  Imagine that!  The scenario of the shy guy coming out plays quite a lot in life.  It doesn't surprise me that the author of this book was a consultant/writer on the Sex and the City show, which to me was overrated and a glorified sitcom.  He seems to buy into the cliche that ALL men are pigs (which they are not), and all they want is to screw around.  And since they always want to screw around, they'll talk to you if they're into ya.  Relationships are extraordinary complicated things, and a simple, feel good, Dr. Phil type book is not going to solve those problems.  This is one of those books.  Greg got a TV show out of it (which, mercifully, has been cancelled), where he dispensed more of this inane, \\"feel-good\\" garbage.  Ugh.  Sadly, the saga isn't over, as a movie is being made from this trifle.  If you really want to understand relationships, watch Scenes from a Marriage by Bergman, or the films of Catherine Breillat.  If you want a naive book that has little or no insight into relationships (but does have a catchy title), buy this.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|I love this collection of new songs - both Bob's voice and the songs are unformly better than \\"Love and Theft\\" which I also like very much. It's at least as significant as Time Out of Mind and definitely more upbeat. This is written and performed by a man happy with his life and a long perspective.  I cannot understand the few negative reviews in here - this is just a great CD - an absolute MUST for Bob fans and a great CD for others.
B000GG4KTU|1.0|I agree with those who think Krall does her best with her trio and piano in back-up and that her voice and phrasing are strange on this album.  I listened once to the CD and gave it away.  I used to be a huge fan, but her last two CD's have greatly disappointed.  I recommend you listen before you buy.  Obviously, some really loved this work.  Go figure.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I never got to see Kingdom of Heaven in the theaters and had only heard not very good reviews.  Thus I was completely blown away when I rented the DVD.  Why there were any bad reviews I have NO idea, I loved the movie from beginning to end and thought Orlando Blooms performance outstanding.  All the actors, especially Alexander Siddig, were great as well. <br /> <br />The 4 Disc Director's Cut was fascinating, I have read a good deal of Crusades history and really enjoyed Ridley Scott's retelling.  I have so often read about medieval battles and the ones in this movie were almost overwhelming, they helped me finally visualize what could have been like.  The deleted scenes enlarged the telling, the Queens relationship with her son made a great deal of historical sense.  I also liked the little documentaries.  So, for me, it was worth the price.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is my third experience with Ghibli studios and I am not disappointed. I am actually starting to develope a taste for their animation. The drawing and coloring was again as great as I expected. The movie starts in a very mysterious setting leaving you a little scared what would come next. As movie passes on you start to see new kinds of spirits. Not many of them are bad, they are just seeking a resting place away from materialistic world. The movie is in general not meant to be about scary ghosts or vengeful spirits. It is actually about coexistence of men and spirits and how they try to reach a balance. In cases spirits help men or vice versa. Myazaki explains in the special features how this animation is based on his real life experience and it seems that he actually modeled the little girl after a friends daughter whom he knew.  <br /> <br />I think generally this is a good movie and I also recommend that you have a look at other Ghibli creations too.

Say \\"Yeah!\\" Then get this CD. 16 tunes grace this CD, a compendium of blues standards from Leroy Carr, Eddie Boyd, Willie Dixon, Sonny Thompson, James Lane, Lowell Glenn, Lowell Fulson, Elmore James, Freddy King, McKinley Morganfield (aka Muddy Waters), Charles Brown, and Johnny Moore. What isn't standard, of course, is Eric Clapton, whose brilliant guitar playing is in full flower on this wonderful CD. The real surprise here is Clapton's singing. He does things with his voice on this CD that make a listener think Clapton is possessed by a blues spirit. I have never heard him sing better, or with more variations in tone color. The supporting musicians are of the first water, and the album was recorded live, no overdubs (with two exceptions) or edits, yielding a you-are-there-at-the-roadhouse-on-Saturday-night sound. \\"From the Cradle\\" is a desert island CD, meaning if you were going to be marooned with a solar-powered CD player and a small collection of CD's, you'd want to include this one. Clapton recorded some of the songs as electric blues, some as acoustic, and created a nice mix of the yin and yang of blues for the listener.  Yeah, Clapton's a white British guy, but he was born to play and sing the blues. Ain't nobody better.
B00003W8NM|4.0|Now, I guess it's time to talk about Fight Club.<br /><br />I finally got a chance to see the film on my recent flight over to China...completely unedited.<br /><br />As you might expect, given the title, the film is violent. But, it is well shot, with great performances from Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, Elizabeth Bonham-Carter, and Meatloaf.<br /><br />Edward Norton plays a professional and frequent traveler, who lives alone and without personal aims. A chance meeting with Brad Pitt's character sets things in action, and the two men form a bond through fighting, and then by setting up a \\"fight club\\". The fighting is a way of release for people who feel disconnected and overly controlled in their lives...but it represents also the deeper problems in society, and the urge to fight back against them. The fight club begins to take on a life of its own, with Brad Pitt's character forging a more sinister purpose for the group. The situation spirals out of Norton's control, and he tries desperately to pull things back...when he encounters the true nature of Pitt's character.<br /><br />Meatloaf dons man-breasts...that takes courage. I would do many things for films, but I won't do that.<br /><br />The violence is unsparing, and sometimes hard to watch. This is not a film for children.<br /><br />But, I would recommend it, as something to watch and then ponder.
B00000J6AG|4.0|\\"Play\\" was my first introduction to Moby. I remember when I lived in Milwaukee in 1999, I had lived with three other people. One of my roommates had bought the original version of \\"Play\\" (which the version of the hit \\"South Side\\" did not have Gwen Stefani on vocals). My roommate would have \\"Play\\" on his stereo non-stop. It did not take me very long to fall in love with the album. I eventually acquired my own copy of \\"Play\\". Personally I think this is Moby's best album I have heard. After picking up few more of his cds, I noticed that \\"Play\\" picked up where \\"Everything is Wrong\\" left off with the gospel-infused techno sound. The majority of \\"Play\\" is good but there were a couple of misses. I hate saying this but Gwen Stefani has an annoying voice. I find her voice quite shrill. She totally ruins \\"South Side\\". I much prefer the original version which did not include her on the track. I was not really too keen on \\"Find My Baby\\" or \\"Bodyrock\\". Personally I absolutely loved the gospel infused \\"Why Does My Heart Feel so Bad?\\". It is a gorgeous ballad. Techno music rarely sounds emotional but in this particular case, the heartache in the gospel sample shines through. As overplayed as \\"Porcelain\\" was on various soundtracks and chill out compilations, I still love the beautiful melodies. The techno tracks are easily the best tracks on the cd while the more guitar orientated tracks were not as good. Nevertheless, I still consider \\"Play\\" a classic album in the electronic genre.
B000HC2LIK|1.0|I wish I had heard about the versions coming out in 2007 before spending a dime on this one. The picture is no better than before and the sound may actually be worse. I hope this film gets the velvet-glove treatment it deserves. It stands out as one of the greatest science fiction films ever - not a space opera like Star Wars or Trek, or cheesy alien monster-of-the-month gore-fest, but true, brilliant, thought provoking sci-fi. There are all too few films like this one. Treat it with the respect it deserves.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Impressive album.  Her voice is soulful.  She blends light blues, soul, and jazz very masterfully.  The overall tone of the album is the perfect rainy day album or sitting around with your significant other with a glass of wine.  She has some faster beats and slower.  I can see many ages digging this album.  I bet someone 20 would be just as happy as someone 60.  That requires actual talent.  Not to mention that her lyrics are actually meaningful.  Hats off.
B00005KHJM|2.0|This is movie was filmed in the early 70's, and it shows.  It was very hard to enjoy the movie, having to listen to the cheesy music.   <br />The story involves a police sergeant who travels to a remote Scottish island to investigate the disappearance of a young girl.  The detective is very much a Christian, and the islanders are anything but Christian. <br />There was one scene where a naked lady (I guess you'd consider her pretty if you were into that sort of thing) was singing and beating on the other side of the detective's bedroom wall.  I assume she was trying to seduce him into entering her room, and I don't think she was looking for someone to just perform a duet with.  It was just one of many \\"odd\\" moments in the movie for me.   <br />For me, this was one of those movies that you want to turn off, but you keep thinking to yourself that it has to get better. <br />One review from the Los Angeles Times reads: \\"Witty & scary!  No one who sits through it to the end is likely to find it easy to shake off.\\"  This leads me to believe that I wasn't the only one who considered not sitting through it to the end. <br />For me, the acting wasn't the best it could have been.  It's not the worst movie I have ever sat through, but certainly isn't one of the best.
0141439807|5.0|Jane Austen once mused that her novels are like a miniature mural painted on a two-inch square of ivory. While that's a lovely image, and while Austen was a master of deep character and thoroughly explored emotion, her books have important political elements that should not be overlooked. I'm surprised that more people haven't picked up on this, but Mansfield Park is certainly a defense of feminism and a profound statement on the importance of women's education. It is also, perhaps, a response to people's reactions to the heroines in her earlier works Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice.<br /><br />At the time, women of a certain class were expected to be \\"accomplished,\\" but not necessarily educated. We see this also in \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" when Mr. Darcy chides Miss Bingley on being so very accomplished in such vital arts as table painting though not well-read. Here, the heroine of Mansfield Park, Fanny Price, reads a great deal, but her older cousins the Misses Maria and Julia Bertrams are more accomplished in needlework and playing the pianoforte, as befits the daughters of a baronet. The middle set-piece of the book, the theatricals (they put on a play!), we see how each of the girls reacts when presented with an opportunity to do something fun that is perhaps a tad disreputable and, more importantly, something they know will piss off their father. In the latter part of the book, the three girls are offered various marriages and situations in life. Maria makes disastrous choices that still draw gasps (or at least rolled eyes) today. Julia's choices are hasty and panic-driven, though not as deplorable as her elder sister's. Only Fanny Price is patient, makes the correct moral choices that are not mercenary, and marries for love and honor.<br /><br />Sir Thomas Bertrams muses that, \\"...the most direful mistake in his plan of education [of Maria and Julia]. Something must have been wanting within, or time would have worn away much of its ill effect. Hefeared that principle, active principle, had been wanting; that they had never been properly taught to govern their inclinations and tempers by that sense of duty which alone can suffice. They had been instructed theoretically in their religion, but never required to bring it into daily practice. To be distinguished for elegance and accomplishments - the authorized subject of their youth - could have had no useful influence that way, no moral effect on the mind. He had meant them to be good, but his cares had been directed to the understanding and manners, not the disposition; and the necessity of self-denial and humility, he feared, they had never heard from any lips that could profit them. Bitterly did he deplore a deficiency which now he could scarcely comprehend to have been possible. Wretchedly did he feel, that with all the cost and care of an anxious and expensive education, he had brought up his daughters without their understanding their first duties, or his being acquainted with their character and temper.\\"<br /><br />Sir Thomas's sentiments and even vocabulary are astonishingly similar to those of Mary Wollstonecraft in \\"A Vindication of the Rights of Women\\": that \\"The conduct and manners of women...prove that their minds are not in a healthy state ... one cause of this ... I attribute to a false system of education, ...more anxious to make them alluring mistresses than affectionate wives and rational mothers; and the understanding of the sex has been so [deluded] by this specious homage, that the civilized women of the present century ... are only anxious to inspire love, when they ought to cherish a nobler ambition, and by their abilities and virtues exact respect. ... It is acknowledged that they spend many of the first years of their lives in acquiring a smattering of accomplishments; meanwhile strength of body and mind are sacrificed to libertine notions of beauty, to the desire of establishing themselves, --the only way women can rise in the world,--by marriage. And this desire making mere animals of them, when they marry they act as such children may be expected to act: they dress; they paint, and nickname God's creatures [TK: a reference to Hamlet.] Surely these weak beings are only fit for a seraglio! ... Women are told from their infancy, and taught by the example of their mothers, that a little knowledge of human weakness, justly termed cunning, softness of temper, outward obedience, and a scrupulous attention to a puerile kind of propriety, will obtain for them the protection of a man; and should they be beautiful, everything else is needless, for at least, twenty years.\\" Wollstonecraft's ultimate point is that if women have immortal souls, the only way that women can save them is to be educated, for without education, women are merely animals of habit and beasts of fashion.<br /><br />Ultimately, Fanny Price is the central figure of this novel. Others vilify her as passive and puritanical. Indeed, when asked to join the theatrical production, Fanny insists several times, \\"I cannot act!\\" and this repeated statement has more meaning as a metaphor than as a statement of a lack of thespian abilities.<br /><br />Fanny is, however, good and moral. She does the right thing. She does not marry for money, though everyone urges her to, and even though it means she may end up a spinster and a burden to her cousins and uncle. She finally does marry for love, and one is again reminded of Wollstonecraft's statement that, \\"the woman who strengthens her body and exercises her mind will ... become the friend, and not the humble dependent of her husband.\\" Fanny gets a happy marriage.<br /><br />Fanny's erstwhile friend, Mary Crawford, (who some people like but who I think is horrible) is obviously an answer to those people who liked Elizabeth Bennet (of P&P) a little too much. While Elizabeth Bennet is smart and witty, Mary Crawford has a sparkling but superficial wit. Mary Crawford does not think deeply upon anything but pops off whatever witticism (even ribald ones) that rise to the top of her head. Mary urges Fanny to go to Everingham, the country house that Fanny would live in if she married the wrong man, in a reflection of Elizabeth Bennet's comment in P&P that she started to love Mr. Darcy when she saw the grounds of his house (Pemberly.) In the end, when confronted with a moral fiasco, Mary refuses to consider how the perpetrator has wounded those around her and offended God by breaking a sacrament, and only laments that so many people know about it.<br /><br />TK Kenyon<br />Author of [[ASIN:1601640021 Rabid: A Novel]] and [[ASIN:1601640226 Callous]]: A Novel
B000FQJAIW|5.0|First off, in 1977: Episode 4 A New Hope wasn't in the title.  It wasn't till the film became a hit, that George was able to put it back on the VHS release. <br /> <br />Secondly, 16:9 Widescreen TV didn't exist in 1977.  If you wanted the 1977 enhanced for your set, you should've been more specific.  George relesed it this way to prove a point.  No matter what gets released, someone is going to complain . . .  <br /> <br />That's all I've got to say about that!
0790731479|1.0|This is a review of the 1997 DVD release- thus far, as of September 2006, the only release I know of.<br /><br />Of all of the DVDs in my collection this has to be one of the most disappointing. Without going into minute detail of what makes the film brilliant- the classic score,  the hilarious comedy and Burton's twisted but brilliant vision- the quality of the film transfer to DVD is almost criminal. It probably wouldn't be noticed on television screens smaller than 27 inches, but on larger screens the picture becomes soft and grainy, devoid of detail and utterly perplexing, given that the movie was shot in the late 80's. The first thought that sprang to my mind when watching it was that it almost immediately reminded me of my time in elementary school before we switched to video tape- the transfer is reminiscent of an old, battered 8mm film reel. I own a S-VHS vcr, and I have seen better film transfers on video tape. Additionally, the extras... well, what extras? There are several paragraphs of \\"production notes\\" which are basically brief overviews of Danny Elfman and Tim Burton, but nothing you couldn't gleam from Wikipedia in three minutes.<br /><br />All that aside, I did pay $9 for it at Sam's Club, so the old axiom of getting what you pay for is truer than ever- but I expected so much more. If you're a Beetlejuice fan, wait for the inevitable Criterion Collection or Special Edition remaster.

0060934913|5.0|Hilarious, disturbing and painfully accurate, KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL is a highly recommended book for anyone who loves restaurants, food, good stories and great writing.<br /><br />Essentially an autobiography, KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL is a compilation of essays about the restaurant world and author Anthony Bourdain's journey from a lazy, dishwashing college drop-out to one of the most celebrated chefs in America.<br /><br />What makes Bourdain's journey a fascinating read is the author's fearless honesty about himself and the food business.  Like a flasher, Bourdain reveals it all: the good, the bad and the truly ugly details the greater public would be shocked to learn about this seemingly glamorous industry.<br /><br />While offering invaluable tips about how to cook like a pro, dine like regular and avoid the pitfalls that sink wannabe restaurateurs, Bourdain lovingly exposes the madness and mayhem behind the scenes of America's best restaurants.<br /><br />A chef's chef, Bourdain truly adores the criminal eccentrics who toil in his kitchen and in a sense KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL is love letter to those he affectionately calls the \\"wacked-out moral degenerates, dope fiends, refugees, a thuggish assortment of drunks, sneak thieves, sluts, and psychopaths.\\"<br /><br />Though perhaps too frank for prim and proper types, KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL is so well written and so chock full of twisted details, I would recommend it highly to anyone who loves a good meal as much as a great tale.<br /><br />-- Regina McMenamin
B000002I2M|5.0|Jim Morrsion died while this album was climbing the charts.  I can't listen to \\"L.A. Woman\\" without mixed feelings of joy and sadness.  Joy- because the music, lyrics, and vocals are so fantastic.  Sadness- because this is the last Doors studio album. <br /> <br />If Jim had to go, at least he went out on a high note.  Although Jim, at this time, may or may not show up for a session, what the Doors were able to get on tape was well worth any inconvenience.   <br /> <br />For the \\"L.A. Woman\\" sessions, the band basically went back to the woodshed, literally.  They recorded this masterpiece in their rehearsal studio.  The tracks are essenitally \\"live\\" recordings with very little overdubbing.  Morrison even used a hand-held mic.  The intimacy of this approach adds much to the sound and feeling of the album. <br /> <br />\\"L.A. Woman\\" ended up being Jim's \\"good-bye\\" letter to his fans.
B000063V8T|5.0|The Star Trek Collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series DVD Collections (The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise). At around 1100 minutes per box (a few hours less than the TOS seasons) we are still looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing. That is 1 month of non-stop Star Trek. No DVD series comes remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years. By the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years. It is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also. Our very planet, Earth, has advanced because of Gene Roddenberry's admirable concept. Roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too. `The Bridge' members are like our family. Watch what they do. Then go and spend your life striving for the same on Earth. What engineer, medic, scientist, teacher, worker can not say that Star Trek has not influenced them? The show is this significant in the development of our species. Even Christians respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why. The DVD case is not quite as fancy as the TOS (The Original Series) cases. The TNG case is supposed to resemble a TNG crew briefcase. The case opens to reveal the disc booklet inside a sleeve. Sliding the disc booklet out of the sleeve and flipping it open reveals a spread of 7 discs. There are 4 episodes per disc. However the last disc, disc 7, only has two episodes, for a grand total of 26 episodes (TOS has 8 Discs, 30 episodes). The rest of disc 7 is devoted to Star Trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras...and then some more. The episodes are ordered not in the sequence they where filmed, but in the sequence that they aired, however each episode has been numbered according to the order they where filmed in. This means on one disc you have shows 4, 2, 12 and 1, in that order although Season Three was aired fairly much according to the chronological produced order except for episode one and two which are switched around. The sound has also been remastered to 5:1 Dolby Digital! Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.<br /><br />Star Trek, The Next Generation (TNG) had an amazing impact when it was first broadcast. An instant hit and a milestone in television serials (it ran for 7 seasons unlike its predecessor that ran for 3), its characters and new look Enterprise had us glued to the TV with the first computer generated images of our solar system as Captain Picard utters the immortal words... `To baldly'... I mean... `To boldly go where no man'... I mean... `To boldly go where no one has gone before.' Star Trek: Season 5 has a remarkable improvement in visual effects. The display panels on the enterprise are more interactive. The camera can now pan as special effects take place. Deep space battles seem more intense. We also get a new Star Trek title graphic in the opening sequence. The cliff-hanger conclusion of \\"Redemption, Part II\\" is a great episode although slightly lacking in the promise of a civil war battle between Klingons, Romulans and the Federation, turns out to be more of a character episode than the big epic battler we thought we would get. None-the-less, it is still a good episode that reveals some things about the family of Tasha Yar. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard (with a new red suede coat and grey uniform), Commander William T. Riker, Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge (who sports a new beard in one episode), Lieutenant Commander Worf (who left the Enterprise in Season Four), Commander Deanna Troi, Lieutenant Commander Data and Dr. Beverly Crusher. Ensign Wesley Crusher (who departed from Season Four halfway and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining three seasons) returns for some episodes but is mainly replaced by the new Ensign Ro Laren, a Bajoran. Colm Meaney is here again as Miles Edward O'Brien as is Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan. Alexander Rozhenko as Worf's son now has a reoccurring role since Season Four. Keiko O'Brien, (Miles O'Brien's wife) is firmly established as a reoccurring character. Watch out for the special appearances of Ashley Judd as Ensign Robin Lefler and Leonard Nimoy as Spock! Whoot! Whoot! Strangely enough this is the only season where Q, of the omnipotent Q Continuum, does not make an appearance. Lieutenant Reginald Barclay, engineer is also absent from this Season. Season Four of TNG is mostly about the Klingon High Council, Romulans, communication, Bajora, crystalline entities, disasters, addiction, reunification, time travel, parenting, telekinesis, eugenics, amnesia, possession, euthanasia, sexual repression, time warps, children, cover-ups, sexual attraction, imaginary friends, Borg, invisibility, alternative lives and phase shifting. Like Season Four most the episodes in Season Five have great stories, a perfect balance of planetary exploration and the life of the crew. It much more of the same as in Season Four with the better episodes being `Redemption, Part II', `Darmok' an interesting episode about language, the introduction of the Bajora and Ensign Ro, the Silicon Avatar makes a return, `Unification', Part I and II (both here) with Spock may be one of the most popular double episodes in the whole TNG franchise, certainly more popular than `Time's Arrow', Part I which ends this season with the possibility of something strange happening to Data on Earth. `The Masterpiece Society' shows what happens when a special genetically engineered race has contact from the outside world. Huge of Borg also makes his first appearance in `I, Borg'. Apart from the `Unification' double episode, the instalments `Ethics', about Worf undergoing a major controversial surgical operation and `The Game', when entertainment becomes mind control, have both achieved cult status as some of the best TNG episodes ever aired. Season Five unfortunately has some dull episodes too, many of which occur in the second half of the season, so the best stuff is within the first four discs. It doesn't really create much drive to push for a quick follow up with Season Six, but no doubt because Six is as good as Five was, then we are there for it. As a note: \\"Redemption part II\\" - this episode received a 12 age rating in the UK because it contains Klingon ritual head butting. `Violations' also has sexually violent content (psychic rape). Parents may want to be cautious and view those two episodes before showing it to children. If you are going to move onto Season Six then you will probably want to know that during Season Six the crew make contact with Deep Space Nine. So if you get Deep Space Nice: Season One you can sync up the star dates and watch both franchises in chronological order. If you are in for Six you may also be in for Season One of DS9! So see you in Season Six and DS9 Season One from here!... wooosh.has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining three seasons) returns for some episodes but is mainly replaced by the new Ensign Ro Laren, a Bajoran.

B000FVQYYK|4.0|Buy this album.  It's great.  Muse fans will love it. <br /> <br />My real point here: OK Computer came out almost 10 years ago and that's the last Radiohead album Muse sounded like.  Stop comparing every UK rock band with a moody tenor vocalist to Radiohead.  Please?
B000H7JD4K|4.0|First off I want to clearly state I have been listening to Iron Maiden since I was 5, listening to my uncle playing in his garage band in the late 80's. Now I don't hate this album in fact I think it's a good maiden album. To understand where this album is coming from musically give a listen to Brave New World, but just don't listen to them one right after the other, because some of the songs sound exactly the same to a degree anyway. To me this album takes a more mellow tone then the last release \\"Dance of Death\\". Unlike Dance of Death this album seems to tred into the same reason I did not like Brave New World, it seems too soft and melodic at times when you compare it to their last album (of which I feel is the closest they have come to making music like the did in the 80's, though the signature sound is there it for some reason can lack a kick despite the speed. This album is by no means a botched effort in fact quite the opposite, for a Maiden fan these new songs will keep that NWOBH fresh in your mind. Though it would have been nice if the band kept it's signature harmony style for it's chorus's, there is a clear difference in the tones used by Bruce and the back up vocals (mostly still sung by bruce) that for me distracted from the overall melody. I am not sure why this was done other then to put less emphasis on Bruce, maybe to hide some failings in his vocals (NOT likely though). A good album that over time could be lost to their greater works. Well thats my 2 cents the track by track break down will discuss the tunes further.  <br /> <br />1. \\"Different World\\" This track is a high point starts off strong with Maiden's signature triplets and has a sort of \\"wildest Dreams\\" feel from their previous Album. 5 out of 5 <br /> <br />2. \\"these colours don't run\\" A good song that can sound too much like the song \\"Brave New World\\" especially the chours. Still has some good pwer to it with stron guitar work and vocals. 4 out of 5 <br /> <br />3. \\"Brighter then a Thousand Suns\\" This song has great Riffs and Chords almost reminds me of something off Bruce Dickensons solo album Chemical Wedding. The chourus for this song gets a little repetive and Bruce trepses through vocal volumes and melodies. The song is also about a minuet or two longer then it needs to be. 3 out of 5 <br /> <br />4. \\" The Pilgrim\\" Think Mercenary from Brave new world mixed with a little Nomad, has a middle eastern undertone. Not sitars or anything just a feeling I got from the melody. 4 out of 5 <br /> <br />5. \\"The Longest Day\\" This song has a very powerful image that you draw from listening to the lyrics : \\"in the gloom the gathering storm abates the ships gimlet eyes await\\" very nice tune though like all of these I feel as if it could have been played faster to give you a sense of urgency like some of their earlier works like \\"the Trooper\\". Still this has some nice symphony inspires riff work rising up and walking back down. 4 out of 5  <br /> <br />6. \\"out of the Shadows\\" more ballady then the rest not bad but it's no Journeyman, which remains as my favorite song to close any Heavy metal mix. 3 out of 5 <br /> <br />7. \\" The reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\\" The opening of this song it fantastic, the melody rigns out with light distortion almost like if fog had a sound, with a little riff that reminded me of a bag pipe. basically I love this song great stuff. 5 out of 5 <br /> <br />8. \\"For the greater good of God\\" Don't let the opening fool you this one has power behind it and some classic Maiden \\"riffage\\" if thats a word. 5 out of 5. <br /> <br />9. \\"Lord of Light\\" read about track 8 and apply here. Good stuff all around. 4 out fo 5 <br /> <br />10. \\"The Legacy\\" Suprisingly powerful for a closer they really did not let up on these last few tracks, the opening had me hoping for another Journeyman but alas not.

I have seen this movie twice and both times was  completely engrossed and felt transported - it is a such a beautiful and captivating film that I want to see it again and again just to experience the way it made me feel.
B000002KD9|3.0|I will admit I pretty much held onto this album for 2 songs in particular, and they are \\"Southern Man\\", and \\"When You Dance I Can Really Love\\". They're the 2 strongest on this album. \\"Till The Morning Comes\\" is the next best after those 2, but since it's under a minute and a half it's over before you can get into the groove. \\"Tell Me Why\\" is also halfway decent, but not to start the album off with. After that it's all stubble; \\"I Believe In You\\" is a love song that just doesn't seem to go anywhere as far as I'm concerned, then \\"Cripple Creek Ferry\\" pretty much suffers the same fate as \\"Till The Morning Comes\\". \\"Birds\\" is forgettable, \\"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\\" is another lame love song. Neil Young's cover of Don Gibson's \\"Oh Lonesome Me\\" is by far one of the top 5 worst covers of a hit song, finally the title cut is beautiful piano playing, but the lyrics are horribly weak, and finally the worst song on here which is about as depressing as a Sunday afternoon working at a job you hate, and not getting done until 4:30 at the earliest. \\"Don't Let It Bring You Down\\" I know I never liked it; it's by far one of the worst Neil Young songs other than his \\"Sugar Mountain\\" recorded at Cantaberry House released as a non l.p. 45 in the 70's b/w \\"Heart Of Gold\\". I would have \\"Don't Let It Bring You Down\\" playing in my head those Sunday afternoons I had to work shortly after my wife passed away, and also after coming back from a suspension at work from where I was falsely accussed of doing something I know I didn't do. This song it just has a way to empty all of your soul out, and leave you with nothingness. Mind you there was alot going on in Neil's life at the time; his marriage was breaking up, he was starting to run around with Carrie Snodgrass, he also was showing his free spirit ways also as he would also release an album with Crosby, Stills, Nash that same year called \\"Deja Vu\\". The album only has 2 songs on it that make the backbone; perhaps that's enough, but if you're going to spend money on the cd you would hope that it will be better than just 2 good songs, and perhaps 3-4 more that are decent. I would be downloading the songs I like off of Napster, and forget the rest.
B000089RVX|5.0|Fallen was an amazing success. Although record company estimates were high, it far surpassed even their wildest dreams. The Open Door is next and from the few clips that have been released looks very promissing. One of the best bands of the decade! All of their albums are great!
B00005JP5L|4.0|Little Miss Sunshine....What a lovely story! My husband, who has an 11 yr old granddaughter, and the usual family dysfunction, cried all the way through with intermittent snorts of laughter. At one point I laughed so hard my entire face was wet and my cheeks ache a little this morning.   This movie is about family sticking together for the important things, regardless of differences, history, etc.  (It's got a healthy dose of the \\"F-word\\" sprinkled throughout, so be prepared for that. And there are other shockers, as well.)  The story is made fairly simple and clean by omitting the messy details we all know exist. The acting is so well done, and everyone was lovable.   See this one, you'll be glad you did.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|First off, my opinion of the Waters-Gilmour debate.  Roger was and still is a great songwriter.  But as a (literally) \\"old fart\\" floyd fan...when you hear pre \\"wall\\" floyd songs (and post barrett) you are hearing David Gilmour's lead vocal, for the most part.  My 2 favorite Wall songs are both primarily Gilmour's music and Waters lyrics, Comfortably Numb and Run Like Hell.  Roger, however, was always more prolific than gilmour in turning out songs, similar to lennon/mccartney and harrison.  Regarding the Wall, it has many times been said that Waters pretty much took over the band during the recording.  I was disappointed when The Wall was released that Waters took over most of the lead vocals on this album.  Not because he is a bad singer, just because, to me, Gilmour's ethereal vocals were THE SOUND of pink floyd, in addition to his fantastic guitar work.    Anyway, now my short review of PULSE. I simply refer you to the title of my review!!  I was one of the lucky few who saw pink floyd RIGHT after the initial release of Dark Side of the Moon (tour of same), at a 3,000 seat venue.  This was before Dark Side really made them a band for the masses. It remains one of my all time favorite concerts as well as one of the best I've ever seen, and I've been to 50+ (too old to remember exactly how many).  This video brings it all back for me, the SOUND of pink floyd.  GET IT !!!!!!!
B0001AP158|1.0|What a waste.  These guys are SO much better than this.
0393061434|5.0|My sister got me this book and within one day of getting the book I could not put it down and read almost half the book. I've had the book now for two days and am almost done reading it. Sitting at my Mac right now my mind is swimming and I am just in Awe thinking of the wonderful and amazing things Steve Wozniak came up with to make the Computer for the masses, the Apple computer. Of Course Woz came up with many more great things and I cannot list them all here. If you are like me and love to read about Great Creative minds, you love to read about History of Technology, then you have to read iWoz. The book is very well written, much better than most other of those tell all bio books. Steve is very candid about his life and everything. I wish Steve Wozniak could of stayed at Apple Computer longer than he did, I know he had other passions and there were things that were out of his control, but if Wozniak had stayed at Apple, I truly believe it would be 10 times better than it is now. I have great respect and admiration for this man now. So I say thanks to my sister for sending me this book and say thanks to Steve Wozniak and Gina Smith for writing it.
B000BTGY1O|5.0|This is one of those classic romantic dramas that manages to get you in the old-fashioned, Hollywood way. Audrey Hepburn is Holly Golightly, a playgirl and escort trying to marry into money. George Peppard is Paul Varjak, a struggling writer being \\"supported\\" by an older woman. The film follows the pair as they get to know each other, accept their feelings, and deal with their lot in life.<br /><br />Objectively, there's not much plot. We jump around Holly and Paul's life, and are treated to some startling revelations of Holly's past and her current dealings. It feels disjointed, and even somewhat hard to believe at times. But really, what you're here for is Audrey Hepburn. She captivates. She shines. She enchants. I instantly fell in love with her when I saw this film. Simply put, Audrey made me believe in happy endings again. There's a lot to be said in that.<br /><br />Paramount did a so-so job with this anniversary edition dvd. There's a commentary and a few tidbits for supplements, but you end up feeling so much more could've been said. Whatever. Breakfast at Tiffanys is schmaltzy Hollywood romance done right. Buy it, love it, and get swept up by Holly Golightly all over again.
B000GTLQXU|3.0|I did enjoy the first take on this story with Gene Hackman but I must say I enjoyed this version better. However, since I already knew the story it felt like that sense of excitement was almost taken away. It's an excellent movie with pretty cool special effects.
B000GTLQXU|2.0|So I will readily admit it--the original POSEIDON ADVENTURE, complete with the soundtrack song of \\"There's Got to be a Morning After\\" played a major part if my childhood mythology.  I saw it with my father at the tender age of six, and vividly recall walking outside the theater to be told that the ground was \\"icing up.\\" That evening became the famous ice storm of 1972 (made even more famous by the movie, ICE STORM), and seeing the original film has assumed a sort of epic quality in my childhood recollections.<br /><br />All that aside, as well as the fact that a ship turning upside down when you're only six is pretty heady stuff, this movie just fell flat for me.  I had hoped that something more than special effects would bring the original up to date.  What I found was a cast of characters that was too sweeping, and that this particular version owed a bit too much to the smash TITANIC.<br /><br />Also, I just love Richard Dreyfus.  Just saw him again in JAWS in the past day or so while watching the DVD.  What's going on with him? He seemed very off to me, but more than that, this remake came off as downright empty.  I'm sorry to say it, too, because with many admirable actors populating the cast (Andre Braugher, Josh Lucas, Dreyfus), I'd thought this would be a powerful film.  Not so.  Apart from the moment when the massive tidal wave turns the cruise ship upside down, it was boring all the way through.<br /><br />Wish I could recommend it, but alas, I just can't.  I say go find the original, turn the air conditioning way down low and imagine an ice storm.  Better yet? Rent THE ICE STORM, a far better film.  :)
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|I must admit that initially I didn't want to watch this movie. I'm not a big Brad Pitt fan and I viewed this as just another vehicle for Brad to strike a glamorous pose or two and nothing more. Fortunately I changed my mind and gave it and chance and I'm happy I did.<br /><br />'Troy' released in '04 is an epic of grand proportions, brilliantly directed with a crisp script, stellar cast and memorable soundtrack. Brad Pitt was perfect for the part of Achilles as was Eric Bana as Hector. I would also like to credit Peter O'Toole for delivering one of his best performances in years as Priam, King of Troy, Diane Kruger as the lovely Helen and Sean Bean in the role of King Odysseus.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I just purchased this DVD set two weeks ago after hearing all the positive feedbacks and reviews. WOW! I got my money's worth. The stories are interesting, the special effects are not cheesy and the dialogues can have you crack up laughing when you least expected it. Both Jensen *drooling* and Jared are awesome and have great chemistry, on par with Mulder and Scully. Girls, for 40 bucks to look at two of Hollywood's hottest TV guys for 22 hours is a cheap deal! I am definitely getting season 2 once it is available next year. <br /> <br />However, being a major X-Files fan, I do believe Supernatural is still a long way from reaching the cult status X files currently enjoys. For one, I find the camera movement, the lighting, the music and the supporting cast are a bit less \\"professional\\" than X files... Or perhaps I am just too used to X-Files. But it seems like the X Files is geared towards mature audiences whereas Supernatural is more geared towards young teenagers. *Think of movies like The Others versus I know what you did Last Summer* <br /> <br />Anyways, having said that, I still think Supernatural deserves 5 stars just because they have two wicked male leads and they were able to scare me on a couple of occasions. The gag reel is a great addition to the special features and you just can't miss the complementary by Jensen and Jared!! Hopefully in season 2, they can add more of that stuff.
0375707972|3.0|The beginning of this book was quite interesting. A relationship developed between the adolescent boy & the 30something Hanna. But as time goes on, he moves on with his life, which is nothing to speak of, really. The cover speaks of \\"a secret\\" and it's never really clear if she is guilty of that secret.  <br />While reading the book I was waiting for the climax & disappointedly found none.
0743435729|5.0|David Weber's Honor Harrington series has fans among military sci-fi buffs and fans of C.S. Forester's \\"Horatio Hornblower\\" series too. And I wouldn't be at all surprised to learn that Honor has a following among teenaged girls as well.<br /><br />In \\"Honor of the Queen,\\" the second in the series, Honor is dispatched to a planet that has issues with female authority figures, and soon is enmeshed in military-diplomatic maneuvers against a sister planet that has really really serious issues with female authority figures.<br /><br />The pullquote on the page before title has Honor doing something nasty to a diplomat, and you can't wait to read on to find the incident where this occurs. It turns out to be right at the heart of the story, as Honor, wounded, outgunned, outgrrrled, takes on the whackjobs on the sister planet.<br /><br />Five stars. The author has achieved perfectly what he set out to do.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I understand that everyone is going to have their own ideas about this movie and the \\"Firefly\\" series. Let me tell you my point of view. I was one of the unfortunate ones who never got to see the series. I was always too busy and I figured I'd get around to it. One day my family came into the very end of Serenity on HBO. We certainly didn't recognize it but being sci-fi and action fans loved it immediately. I got it and we watched it from the beginning and instantly loved the movie. After seeing the end, watching it through, things made so much more sense. This movie stands alone very well without the backstory. Of course, the history helps explain certain things and helps you to understand the characters, but this movie certainly holds it's own. Then, I learned that it was based on \\"Firefly\\" the series. Now, I had to get the series. Well, I can't stop watching it. This series is very smart. These people are all on their own, cut off from society. In this type of a situation, it's human nature to adapt to a new way of life, even a new way of speaking whether it be developing a new dialect or reverting to \\"cowboy\\" ways because you are so cut off from the mainstream that you do what you can to survive. It's too bad the networks couldn't see it for what it was. I'm not much of a t.v watcher because I feel there's not much worth watching, especially during prime time on the networks. I only hope that the fans, Joss and actors would see fit to let Serenity fly once more.....
B000001DQI|5.0|I'm sure there is very little I can say about this double album that hasn't already been said.  This is a pure masterepiece--Elton John at his absolute best.  Of Elton's 40 some LP releases over the past 37 years, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road is his top work in my opinion.  There are some that come close--Madman Across The Water, Honky Chateu, Rock of the Westies come to mind--but they can't quite touch this gem.  The songs here are not only musical but visual--as if crating a movie for the blind. <br /> <br />The list of song titles here is incredible. It basically consist of a who's who of Elton John songs. Many will be familiar with Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding, Benny and the Jets, Harmony, Candle In The Wind, and the title track.  There are also wonderful lesser known songs.  One which comes to mind is the funky rocker, Dirty Little Girl--one of my favorites for years. <br /> <br />If you could own no other Elton John album, this would be the one to choose.  Easily on par with the Beatle's White Album or The Stones, Exile On Main Street, Goodbye Yellow Brick road has remained one of rock's most valuable creations for the past 33 years!
1563890119|5.0|Intermittently, between the films that I watch and the video games I shamelessly play, I do enjoy reading a good graphic novel here and there.  Why not taste all the facets of pop culture when I have the opportunity?  Neil Gaiman is the author that re-introduced me to the world of graphic novel.  Through his fantastic novel (meaning a story that you could read more than one time) entitled \\"American Gods\\", I found this fantastical writer's ability to draw upon the strength of other pop culture ideas as well as nearly blend fantasy and fiction together with the greatest of ease.  It was right after my reading of \\"American Gods\\" that I decided to pick up the first in his ever-popular \\"Sandman\\" series entitled Preludes & Nocturnes.  From the opening frames of a miscalculated capture, through the inevitable adventures to recover lost/stolen items, to the hauntingly original final scenes where our main character, Sandman, introduces us to his family and builds a stronger, more poetic beginning to the next chapter, The Doll's House.<br /><br />Honestly, I wasn't sure what to expect when I opened the first page of this glorious graphic novel.  There were so many different themes and stories blazing the pages, that at times I felt a bit overwhelmed, but what makes this collection of stories stand out, I was never lost or confused.  Gaiman, with impressive artwork by Sam Kieth, Mike Dringenberg, and Malcolm Jones III, takes us through different (already established) storylines - like John Constantine, Satan, and the all-powerful JLA - but with a bold new stroke of creativity.  Gaiman, from frame one, never looses his momentum.  He combines familiar characters with those we know nothing about, but are willing to learn about.  What I enjoyed the most about Gaiman's story is that he never once let us forget about smaller, minuet characters.  Even closer to the end, when we think that we have already learned all we can about our smaller moment, or that they have left our story all together, Gaiman pulls them out once more to demonstrate how small this very large world truly is.  Finally, what pulled this story together for me to the bitter end (at least of this collection) was our main character, Sandman.  For a character confined to the dream world and imprisoned for 40 years, his level of humanity and humanistic actions created one of the strongest literary characters I have witnessed.  His expressions, emotions, and overall development through these stories kept me glued to the page until the early hours of the morning.  I believed in our heroine, while Gaiman gave no indication that his character would be successful in his quest, I believed and kept the pages turning to see what would be the final explosive conclusion.<br /><br />I do not believe I felt any negativity towards this collection of stories.  The artwork was crisp and continually changing to appeal to a growing audience.  The story was extremely smooth with characters that would immediately mark Gaiman's honest entry into the world of graphic novels.  I especially loved the blend of other graphic characters.  I thought this gave Sandman more depth and bigger scope.  If I had to point out one miniscule issue that I had, it would be the sporadic change of illustrations.  Most of the time the panels read right to left, but occasionally, our illustrators changed it up (a neat idea, ill-fully carried out), but again, a very small issue that was forgotten about by the end of the story.<br /><br />Overall, I loved this story.  While I don't have many words to put down about my overall feelings of this collection, it is just because I am currently reading the next collection eager to see what new troubles our hero must face after nearly 40 years of incarceration.  Gaiman and his team have crafted a cult hero with this series, demonstrating humanity and demonic truths all piled into one.  Almost takes me down a Hellboy path, but I don't want to draw that connection.  I strongly suggest starting at this point in the series.  Some series you can begin anywhere and still get the full effect, but with this one, events are set up early to allow for future dwellings and happenings in this fantastical world.  Go out and get this now.  I promise you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****gly suggest starting at this point in the series.  Some series you can begin anywhere and still get the full effect, but with this one, events are set up early to allow for future dwellings and happenings in this fantastical world.

B0009YA386|4.0|3.99 stars <br /> <br />What happens when you add main ingredients of Echo & Bunnymen with the likes of Interpol (toss in a small amount of Depeche Mode's Violator album)? <br /> <br />You get \\"Editors.\\" <br /> <br />Anyone who likes either of the two mentioned band, there's a high probability you'll like this band.  (Yes, Joy Division is part of the equation too, but to a lesser extent to my ears at least). <br /> <br />From a personal standpoint, Interpol's Turn On The Bright Light's album is easily and by an incredibly long measure my all time favorite album. I'm truly flawed by its cohesion. <br /> <br />The reason I state this in a review for Editors Back Room is obvious, I'm just following suit with everyone else as critics, both professional and amateur. <br /> <br />I start out by giving Editors a 5 star ranking and then I carefully analyze reasons to take points or stars away.  Here are those reasons for detracting: <br /> <br />-repetitive nature in too many and too many parts of the songs, too many follow a fairly strictured approach. <br /> <br />-repetitive nature in my favorite instrument, drums.  I feel that drums driving a song with a slight infusion of chaos can really turn a great song into a masterpiece.  These are some great songs, but no masterpieces. <br /> <br />-lyrics while great in many spots, also have too many weakpoints.  Ex:  \\"Bullets\\" repetitive chorus \\"you don't need this disease\\" (and music). <br /> <br />-simplicity, the double edged sword.  In many spots the deceptive simplicity of Editors music is great, but it does also rear an ugly head and turn me off a bit at times in many of the songs.  Ex:  the first minute + of \\"Open Your Arms\\" <br /> <br />-inconsistent intensity.  Self explanatory.  Ex:  \\"All Sparks\\" is the standout track based on intensity, followed quickly by somewhat stale sounding Depeche Mode wannabe <br /> <br />-*-End Detractions-*- <br /> <br />-*-Begin Praise-*- <br /> <br />-\\"Fall\\" is the best song Echo & Bunnymen never made. <br />-All the faster and more uptempo songs (Munich, Blood, Bullets, Lights, and others) are very suitable for listening to with friends.  (More so than Interpol, Echo&Bunnymen, and Joy Division's.  Other nu-wave or post-punk or whatever you want to call it music I find doesn't translate well to listen to in the presence of others) <br />-Guys, your girlfriend will probably like Editors more than Interpol or Echo or JoyD.  I'm told by all females that I've had sample Editors that Tom Smith has an incredibly sexy voice that is very pleasing to the female ears.  I would say this to add to it:  Tom Smith's has a greater default intensity in his voice that is lacking in the overly mentioned other bands.  However, I feel that Paul Banks's vocals are better when tries, as Banks can reach levels of superiority that Smith can't. <br /> <br />Overall, I want to give this a higher rating, I really do, because it really is great sounding, well produced, and really falls into my style with the deep thumping bass lines, twangy chimey sharp mesmerizing guitars, simplistic drums with tons of good cymbal work, and intense vocals.  I just can't based on what's already been done and the detractions (most importantly repetitiveness) named above. <br /> <br />Very highly recommended if you've managed to get yourself to this page.  Compared to what I feel today is a very very small selection of good music to choose from, this is outstanding. <br />
B0000501C3|5.0|This recording is virtually a \\"walk through\\" the music of Jean-Baptiste Lully. Of course, most of Lully's music was written for the opera and many orchestral movements from his operas are to be found on this soundtrack. Those who think Baroque operas began with Monteverdi and ended with Handel and there wasn't anything in between will be in for a shock - Lully was actually a very good composer and his operas are much better than many people think.<br /><br />I was a little surprised that Reinhard Goebel and his Musica Antiqua K&ouml;ln were chosen or volunteered for the job of recording this soundtrack. MAK are not a group I normally associate with French Baroque orchestral and/or operatic music. I guess that I would have thought that the music of Biber, Schmelzer, Buxtehude, Telemann and the various members of the Bach family would have been much more their \\"natural territory\\" and/or \\"comfort zone\\".  Perhaps Christophe Rousset and his Les Talens Lyriques ensemble weren't asked or were asked and turned down the job? I would have thought that Marc Minkowski and his Musiciens du Louvre or William Christie's Les Arts Florissants would have been obvious choices for the recording of this soundtrack? Unavailable, uninterested or too expensive may have been the reasons the director passed over these French Baroque music specialist ensembles.<br /><br />However! MAK and Herr Goebel do a fine and stylish job in this music and I only wish they'd record a complete work by Lully. Well, maybe they'll get around to it some time?<br /><br />This CD is both entertaining and educational. I still haven't seen the film, but I did enjoy \\"Farinelli, Il Castrato\\" very much and I am sure that the director made a similarly interesting film about Jean-Baptiste Lully and Louise XIV.<br /><br />If ever a film is made of the life of Heinrich Ignaz Franz von Biber, Reinhard Goebel and his Musica Antiqua K&ouml;ln would be the obvious choice for the band to record the soundtrack.
B0000255CL|4.0|New drummer Horgh adds the razor sharp precision and the ability to play a variety of rhthyms (other than just blast beats) missing from previous Immortal records (excepting Blizzard Beasts when Horgh first joined) and the band is better for it. Abbath now takes over on guitar with the result being a more melodic and somewhat slower approach: a sound that became most fully realized on their last album Sons Of Northern Darkness. But unlike that great album, this one is more atmospheric and just a little nastier, which is a good thing. The sound is flawless and huge thanks to Peter T&auml;gtgren's production skills and the songs have a palpable sense or darkness and cold about them. At The Heart Of Winter reflects the waning influence of blast beat oriented black metal and the rise of what Immortal called themselves: holocaust metal and it's one of their best.
B000002GK1|5.0|THE mind bending super album of their career. Soundgarden's amazing talent come together perfectly on this album. Heavy, majestic, rolling, pounding rhythms and melodies throughout. Incredible vocals -- searing guitar --  drums on the edge. - Bass pounding my soul - tempo and time changes everywhere. Wow this album completely destroys the competition in their midst. I must have listened to this album 100 times when it was released and to this day it takes me somewhere else. This album is perfect.<br /><br />I saw them tour for Superunknown and was disappointed that they didn't play any songs from Badmotorfinger. What the?? How did that happen? Maybe my memory is hazy and they might have played Outshined - but seriously what the F**!?
B000G759LW|4.0|i am so glad that christina is able to explore musical directions.  is there anyone else right now that can pull off this sound right now, and pull it off with this level of greatness.  we all know that she blows britney and jessica out of the water and has ever since she started.  she is the new \\"voice\\"  and what a voice it is.  she has the pipes to sing whatever she wants and so far in her career has been singing what she wants.  she has taken charge of her career and is putting out records that are her own and do not really reek of studio meddling.  her lead single of aint no other man is phenomenal.  it is a hip shaker and a great time all around.  for me the whole album is sung beautifully but if i had to pick favorites my other two would be candy man and still dirty, and nasty naughty boy.  candy man i can listen to everyday about 20 times a day.  its catchy its hilarious and its fun, what more can you ask for in a song.  still dirty is great cause she is sending a message that she is not 2 dimensional.  she can be Dirrrty if she wants, but she has done that and could do it again if she wanted.  nasty naughty boy is just what it says it is.  nasty!  i love her sexuality and i love that the music and not just the vocals make that song.  which is another positive aspect of the album.  the music and instrumentation sounds great even though it is inspired from the blues era.  she makes it fit right into now.  listen to this record it takes a couple of listens to really get into it but once she gets a hold of you she really does not let go.  you dont want her to either because this album delivers and the ride is one that keeps you coming back for more.

0790734850|5.0|It took me several recomendations before I decided to take a look at this film. At first with reservations upon learning the leading roles belonged to a couple of unknown Aussies, one of them (early on) even gives the impression of being nothing but a wimp. Let's just say by the end that impression had changed more than a bit and when the police captain says \\"I wouldn't want to be him for all the whisky in Ireland\\" I was in total euphoria. <br />The plot is so dense and there are so many speaking characters yet they are all perfectly cast and memorable. <br />Rumor has it a new special edition is on the way, however, the DVD out there is hardly short on features, I specially like the Guy Pearce / Russell Crowe screen tests. It's hard to tell how Director Curtis Hanson saw their greatness under all that hair. <br />One of the best movies I've ever seen. Period.
1592401791|5.0|A must read for Beatle fans, recording engineers and musicians. An inside look at the technical side of Beatles' recordings and sessions without being too dry. Great book. Best read next to your stereo with your pile of Beatles records (or CDs) handy, Geoff Emerick explains how many of the effects were achieved in the studio. And... the Walrus was Paul.
B00005N5S5|5.0|The Terminator is the first edition in a three part sci-fi story about a Terminator sent back to the past to terminate Sarah Conor, the mother of John Conor...most know the story and have seen the movie, but the reason for my review is to outline exactly how effective this movie alone is, and how it succeeds and why. <br />   Before I begin, I must say that James Cameron has done an incredible job directing the first two Terminator movies. <br />   Terminator 1 is the basis for the next two sequels, just watch it and note how well the plot, action and Kyle's emotional flashbacks blend together. No time is wasted in this movie, no emotion rushed, and no action is made without meaningful cause.  <br />   This may even be the most perfect sci-fi movie ever created, it may not have the glossy effects of T2 or T3, but that is not to say it is any worse than those two films...actually I find the first Terminator movie to be the best of the three...it has stronger acting, more thrilling chases and an overall darker, more chilling feel. <br />All the chase scenes are at night...actually most of the movie is aswell, and I find that to suit the movie very well and I must not forget to mention the soundtrack...it is absolutely dark and chaotic. <br /> <br />Without any doubt in my mind I can honestly say that this is the most touching one of the Terminator movies.
B000H305U0|4.0|After listening to SexyBack, I was dead set on not getting this album.  I truly hated the song and the screeching \\"You're ready!\\" throughout the chorus.  Thankfully, they played \\"My Love\\" in a few weeks and I was easily persuaded to buy the album the day of its release.  I am satisfied with the album. <br /> <br />Standout tracks from the album include \\"My Love\\", \\"Love Stoned\\", \\"What Goes Around....\\".  I also liked \\"Chop Me Up\\" and \\"Damn Girl\\".  The one thing that's different about this album, in comparison to his debut, are the interludes between songs.  Where one person might find these filler or sheer laziness of writing another song, I thought they were exceptional and even better than some of the actual tracks.  Seriously, I loved the interlude \\"I Think She Knows\\" - it reminds me of Coldplay with the pianos and haunting melody.   <br /> <br />Overall, Justin Timberlake continues to make good strides in the blue-eyed soul/funk/R&B area.  But, please, take Sexy back to wherever it came from.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|First off, I only give this four stars because it is not 5.1 Dolby.  Ok, there is my complaint.  Secondly, people need to quit boo-hooing George releasing the \\"original\\" trilogy.  I personally think it is about time he did it.  Nothing against the \\"updated\\" versions, but I run as a bit more of a purist; I don't like my Star Wars movies screwed with.  Yes, the updated versions are more in line with what he wanted, but you know what, when I saw them in the theater, they didn't have the extras and I still made sure I owned them on VHS.  I'm sure George didn't release them because he needs the money, but because there are a bunch of anal purist fans like myself out there that wanted our Star Wars movies back, unmolested.  To all the \\"fans\\" complaining they need to buy a whole new trilogy, no you don't.  Just don't buy them.  Keep your money, just don't cry about it.
0895260131|1.0|I am a typical, blond haired, blue eyed, dyed in the wool patriot. Yet one thing is for certain, this book really twists the truth a lot!!!<br /><br />I won't bother writing a 5 hour count by count review. Just do this...go to your local bookstore, sit down and peruse any number of historically accurate accounts of the crusades. Neither side was innocent back then, however, we Christians were certainly cruel, murderous, treacherous and terroristic in our battles.<br /><br />This book by Spencer makes it out as if we are sweet little innocent victims. We are not. This does not mean we should be sorry. I cannot possibly be responsible today for what happened hundreds of years ago. I am simply saying...BE HONEST and UNBIASED if you're going to write about history.

B000H7JD4K|5.0|This has got to be the best metal album of the year.the boys have done it again.go and buy it right now. <br />UP THE IRONS,HARRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
B00004KD11|4.0|Band Personnell:  Rod Evans - Vocals  Ritchie Blackmore - Guitars  Nick Simper - Bass and Backing Vocals  Ian Paice - Drums  Jon Lord - Organs and Backing Vocals    This was the time right after they changed name from \\"Roundabout\\" to \\"Deep Purple\\", in this period they tried to find their sound, because of this 50% of the album contains cover songs from Joe South, Skip James, The Beatles and Billy Roberts, they only used a couple of days to complete the whole album.  The cover song \\"Hush\\" by Joe South was their most successful song from the poineering lineup, \\"Help\\" was a slower version than the original version by The Beatles, and the final song \\"Hey Joe\\" was earler covered by Jimi Hendrix also became very popular from this lineup.  All in all this album is a very good beginning of new Deep Purple fans, just to get the feel of how it all began.
B000H7JD4A|5.0|I bought this record because my 6 years old son likes the picture of Eddie. I already have the classical albums from Iron Maiden's first album to Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son. I didn't expect much because of the 3 or 4 albums before this one, but I am very glad of this acquisition; this a classic Maiden's album, strong, sharp and vigourous !!!. Take the risk, go for it BUY IT is really good !!!
B000002MT0|5.0|Let me first say that I am a long standing Prince fan, so my review will be based on listening to his music for the past 22 years (and counting).  <br /> <br />Come is quite simply a mixture of some of Prince's musical talents, and genius. I suggest you listen to the entire cd from start to finish without stopping. The theme (if there is one) is to give you a taste of what he can do. You can't compare \\"Solo\\" to \\"Loose\\". You can try but you'll only frustrated yourself. Get the cd, give yourself some time, and be prepared for an emotional ride. You'll be happy and sad, feel sexy and want to rock, from one song to the next. Listen to the entire cd and you won't get stuck on what you think Prince music should be and just enjoy what you hear. This is a great ride.
B0001O3YC6|5.0|\\"Pitch Black\\" is the perfect example of a film that clones most of its elements from a previous classic (in this case it's \\"Aliens\\") and yet still manages to be entertaining and amazingly appear somewhat fresh. Both movies involve a group of people stuck on a distant planet being hunted by an extremely dangerous species. After the initial onslaught, both movies then see the remaining characters attempting to survive while desperately working to get off the planet as soon as possible. So how can \\"Pitch Black\\" possibly seem fresh despite all these similarities? Well, the difference is in the details. <br /> <br />When a spaceship is critically damaged by some sort of asteroid storm, the pilot is forced to crash-land on a desert planet that has three suns. Due to at least one of the suns being above the horizon at all times it at first appears as if the planet exists in constant sunlight. Soon after they arrive it becomes apparent that the survivors are not alone. A species of creature takes a few of them out before they have a chance to figure out what's happening. This reptilian looking animal appears to have a severe reaction to light of any sort and so the climate seems to be ideal for the marooned travelers to avoid contact. But when the three suns and a planet all align in a massive scale eclipse, the creatures are free to roam the planet, attacking any life-forms that they come into contact with. The crew will soon come to realize that they need to rely heavily on a convicted killer they were previously transporting if they are to have any chance of survival. <br /> <br />The setup is a good one. The suspense builds dramatically as the light begins to fade away. But the thing that takes the movie to another level completely is the cast and the special effects. The effects are awesome, particularly when you consider that \\"Pitch Black\\" did not have a huge budget. In particular the initial crash scene is grippingly intense and kicks proceedings off with one heck ofa bang. The creatures look real and frightening and the use of light and shadows works well for both the story and the budgetary constraints. The movie was filmed in Australia yet the planet appears alien due to the strange overexposed lighting used throughout the daytime scenes as well as the alien looking skeletal remains that dot the surface. Each member of the cast has a distinct persona as well as their own story to tell. Carolyn (Radha Mitchell) is an attractive young woman that comes awfully close to intentionally killing most of the crew during the crash landing in an attempt to save her own life, only to be considered a hero when they all live to see another day. She struggles throughout the movie with this cowardice and the undue praise that followed. William (Cole Hauser) is a morphine addicted mercenary intent on making sure a convicted criminal comes to justice. But the star of \\"Pitch Black\\" is undoubtedly Vin Diesel as Riddick, an escaped prisoner that the rest of the crash survivors rightfully fear. Diesel doesn't say an awful lot during the movie, yet every time he is on screen, he simply demands attention. I do feel that the creators tried perhaps a little too hard to make Riddick appear insanely dangerous, yet it's a credit to Diesel's performance that the audience still finds themselves in awe of him as well as hopeful to see more of him in action. The character was so successful that there is now a sequel called Riddick as well as a computer game based on him alone. <br /> <br />\\"Pitch Black\\" is most definitely ripping off previous films as stated above, but it does what it does tremendously well. Considering the amount of dreadful monster films that have come out in recent times, the grittiness, setting and Riddick make this movie a complete success. I highly recommend it to any fan of science fiction and horror.
B00005Q3TZ|3.0|I originally had high hopes for this film. After seeing the vastly superior \\"Tora,Tora,Tora!\\" I was looking forward to seeing the attack on Pearl Harbor done with today's special effects. <br /> Unfortunately they had to throw in one of the most ridiculous love stories ever set in a war film. <br />The plot has to do with two childhood friends who join the Army Air Corps. While going through a physical, Ben Afleck falls in love with Kate Winslet. He then volunteers to go help the British as a fighter pilot and is subsequently shot down and presumed dead. Josh Hartnett (Affleck's best friend)  falls in love with her and after months of not hearing from Ben she falls in love with Josh. Ben returns and he and Josh have a big fight... <br /> Anyway the attack sequence was the most exciting part of the movie, it looks and sounds great if you have a home theater and a big screen TV, but if you want to see the sequence in it's entirety I suggest you go with the Vista version it's quite a bit more graphic and would have probably earned the movie an R rating (those folks at Disney probably would have hated that!) as well as all the bonus materials they include: <br /> An interactive timeline of the events leading up to pearl harbor. <br /> Deleted scenes <br />Blooper reel <br />Several documentaries on making the film       <br />A great set of post cards with the actors that look like old war posters <br />Production diaries <br />The stars at boot camp <br />And much more.... <br /> <br />So if you've got almost three hours to kill and want to see a great action sequence get this set and just chapter skip to the bombing.  <br />
B000H5U65C|5.0|It's been less than two weeks since this monster was released.  As such I've been tentative to write this review because I think this album is so amazing that I've been afraid I may make a proclamation I'll regret.  That having been said, after listening to the album about 40 times in two weeks I cannot help myself...I must proclaim Blood Mountain to be one of the greatest metal albums of all time, certainly Mastodon's greatest.  If this is \\"extreme metal\\" than this is the greatest extreme release of all time.  Mastodon have mastered everything, musically speaking, that this genre relies on.  They are unsurpassed in technical playing (that remains catchy and tuneful), jazz-prog insanity, impassioned bellowing, trippy choruses, heavy, creative riffs, and total power.  As I listen for the 41st time, I'm still blown away that a band could make this album.  Considering how amazing Leviathan was, I'm equally shocked that Mastodon came out with Blood Mountain album a mere 2 years later.  If the improvement curve of the first three full length albums continues to the fourth, I will boldly proclaim Mastodon the greatest metal act of the last 20 years.  As it is, I only see Tool topping them now. <br /> <br />Mastodon has done everything they did on Leviathan, just infinitely better.  Their unique riff-writing and song-writing styles have been even further perfected.  The songs are somehow heavier, more complex, and catchier.  Every single song has a chorus, part, or riff that is quite memorable.  Meshuggah relies on the insane time changes combined the vocals so intense they could rip your flesh, Dillinger relies on the psycho-jazz-hardcore technical mastery, Clutch relies on the grooviest riffs ever, and QOTSA relies on heavy guitars with super catchy pop melodies.  Mastodon has combined the best of all of this into a melting pot so perfect it seems impossible.  Going through the merits of each song would be an essay.  I can hardly pick a favorite.  The Wolf is Loose is one of their greatest songwriting achievements, Capillarian Crest has to be heard to be believed, Colony of Birchmen gives the album a dose of Josh Homme for a song that is their grooviest and catchiest yet.  And they've added doses of the sufficiently Tool-ishly bizarre (Circle of Cysquatch), Kyuss and Isis-like trippyness (Sleeping Giant), and Mars Volta meets DEP psycho-spazz-jazz (Bladecatcher, Siberian Divide).  And This Mortal Soil is truly an emotional song, which sees Mastodon combining some Pink Floyd-like melodies to their usual Clutch, Sabbath, Rush, and Metallica influences to form my favorite song on the record.  <br /> <br />The ways they've advanced in two albums from an amazing stoner-thrash-death band to a group capable of this kind of symphonic art is simply astonishing.  Brann Dailor's drumming is perhaps, if you believe this, more complex than ever before.  Brent Hinds and Bill Kelliher's guitar work is the best it's ever been (how good can these guys be - the best duo ever someday?  certainly possible).  Troy Sanders's bass is solid as usual, and his pirate-howl and creepy singing trade-offs with Hinds mark one of the best improvements to Mastodon's sound.  Now the boys have proven they can sing and write melodies, so rare in metal today.  Because of this, the screaming and howling is used to great effect for astounding power rather than it being the only vocal style used because no one can sing (hello 99% of \\"extreme\\" bands).  To top all of this off, Mastodon have written another concept album with an outstanding story of terror in the mythological forest.  They've now developed an Iron Maiden-esque ability to get you involved in the story through the lyrics.  Writing about beasts and adventures isn't easily done because it has become so hackneyed.  Luckily, Dailor's lyrics are the best they've ever been, while retaining his unique style of using short, meaningful phrases to develop often vague lyrical concepts and tell stories.  And of course Mastodon continues with amazing artwork.  Again, only Tool can compete with them in this regard.  This album is the complete package.  This band is a once in a lifetime phenomenon.  I haven't been this excited about a release in a while - I can recall first hearing Rush's Moving Pictures, Black Sabbath's Paranoid, and Tool's Lateralus and feeling similar emotions.  That should give you a pretty good idea of where I think Blood Mountain will stand in rock's pantheon. <br />
0525476881|5.0|From third grade through his senior year of high school, Colin Singleton, child prodigy, has dated nineteen girls.  All of them have been named Katherine (anagrammed in the rake; ie, her tank), and all of them have dumped him.  Not for the same reasons, and not in the same way.  Katherine XVIII dumped him in an email, for example.  And K-19 dumped him immediately after graduation.  Now, faced with a Katherine-less summer, Colin and his best friend, Hassan, decide to take a road trip.  They are short-stopped in Gutshot, Tennessee, home to Archduke Franz Ferdinand's grave, with a job offer.  Since there are no Katherines in sight, only Lindseys and Katrinas, the two boys settle in for the summer to interview textile workers, and, in Colin's case, come up with a mathematical formula for predicting the end result of a romantic relationship -- his Eureka moment.  Layered with fun and funky characters, anagrams, formulas, flashbacks, and footnotes, this complex yet easy-to-read novel is not only compelling, but one of the smartest novels I've read in a long time.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|John was explaining to his audience a few years ago about what he feels \\"cool\\" really is---\\"The sense that what you're seeing or hearing is what everything should be like, or really, cool is what we all want to be but we know we'll just f*** it up and fail at it.  So, what do we do?  We copy.  We get as close as we can to being cool without going past 'go' and getting our $200 and selling out.  I admit it...I copy off everything I think is cool and meld and mold and shape it together into my music.  That's what I did when I was growing up, that's what I doing now and that's what I hope to keep doing in the future.\\"    Continuum is that future.  For people that say John is ripping off or copying other artists, you know what: it's true.  Does it make this record any worse?  Nope.  It's the next step of what John started when he was in high school with that Stevie Ray Vaughn cassette tape from his neighbor that he never returned.  Face it: the only original sound came from Adam & Eve.  Artists build off of other artists because (to quote Simon & Garfunkel) even \\"silence has sound\\" and you can't rip off what was already there, you can only build on it.    Buy this record and experience John's musical sound.  You won't regret it.
B000784WMW|4.0|As a big fan of the Bronte sisters I had always heard this described as the \\"definitive\\" Jane Eyre so I couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy.  Though I do like that so much of the dialogue is taken right from the book and the plot line stays faithful to what Charlotte wrote, Timothy Dalton is just wrong as Rochester.  He is far too young and handsome in this version and the fact that they paired him with an actress who is perhaps too old and even plainer than needed for the role compounds the problem.  I wish they would have allowed  Jane to blossom from Rochester's love into a little bit of a beauty during the courtship scenes yet she remains about the same.  Actually Jane and Rochester's love just does not seem realistic at all and at times Dalton's Rochester seems more nuts than simply passionate and intense and I can see why Jane ran away from him when she found out about the \\"mad woman in the attic\\".   Now I have the 1973 version in my \\"next to see\\" list and I am also hearing good things about the new BBC version that is slated for Masterpiece Theater in January of 2007 and am eagerly awaiting that.
B000001FS6|5.0|'Rattle and Hum' ranks with the all time best live and double albums of rock and roll.  Although there are a few mistakes with the tape acetate in the recording, giving it a shimmering effect that wasn't intended, it hardly mars this fabulous recording.  The C.D. showcases the best of their music and harnesses it to a live performance.  However, there are new studio recordings as well.  Nothing is extraneous and much of it is hypnotic, powerful, or both.    There are worthy remakes (even of their own material).  They start with a hefty version of The Beatles \\"Helter Skelter\\".  Even though it is played and sung with great effort, it remains a worthy rendition, but a lesser song from the set.  \\"Van Dieman's Land,\\" which follows, gives the singer-songwriting helm to The Edge who gives us an eloquent folky song that preaches well.  His thick accent gives the song a good, gritty dimension--even if the task leaves him a bit winded at times.  From there, we get a funny short interview, but get right to the point with the powerful single, \\"Desire\\".  With more meat and potatoes and relying less on The Edge's trademark guitar, Bono and company give us a fine, powerful rocker.  Then, if they haven't been flowing the images of passion well enough by now, the throbbing \\"Hawkmoon 269\\" continues the threads of overboiling desire expertly.  (Notice that Larry Mullens's drumming is wisely brought to the forefront on these two songs.)  Next, \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" certainly proves that, while Jimi Hendrix can't be beat, he didn't have the last word on the Dylan classic.  Their own remakes are fabulous, too.  \\"Silver and Gold\\" is a particular treat for the many of us who didn't serve ourselves up the first time.  The song is as acerbic as Bono's sermon, and both are given live.  Likably, \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" contains a Harlem choir accompaniment that gives the song a whole make-over.  While their troubadour classic could have been left alone, their remake here is a worthy new song in its own right.      The first half of the C.D. ends with a live version of the perennial \\"Pride (In the Name of Love\\".  If anything, the second half is less live, but far better.  \\"Angel of Harlem\\" made another fine single.  A tribute to Billie Holiday, \\"Angel...\\" finds the right jazzy groove and summons just the right words for a succinct and sympathetic bio-op.  Correctly, they slow down for the spare gospel edge of \\"Love Rescue Me,\\" a quiet psalm that builds up to an appropriate crescendo and leaves us off with a proper ending about a weary pilgrimage.  Similarly, \\"When Love Comes to Town\\" broadens the already wide scope of the album and adds B.B. King to the mix with some fast-forward blues accompaniment.  He shares Bono's vocal helm with a beautifully unfolding song of lament for loves both romantic and divine.  One of the C.D.'s best songs is the intricate \\"Heartland\\" complete with shimmering guitar and lyrics that contain a beautiful allegory of a woman and the soul of America all at once.  \\"God Part II\\" continues John Lennon's iconoclastic creed, but adds some beliefs on the plus side.  It borrows musically from \\"Sky Pilot\\" and offers some choice words for Lennon's nemesis biographer, Golding.      They close the album with the fireworks that accompany it.  \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" live makes the studio version on 'The Joshua Tree' sound stiff.  And, here's where we actually get the \\"rattle and hum\\".  If Bono once said, \\"America both fascinates and frightens me,\\" then the near finale send-off accentuates both facets musically.  Taking their cue from Jimi Hendrix, and reiterating \\"Fourth of July\\" from 'Unforgettable Fire,' they cap the horror they presented from the last song lamenting \\"Outside it's America!  Outside it's America!\\"  But, then again, taking a cue from the Beatles, \\"If all's fair in love and war,\\" then love is the final favorite.  The finale is the best song.  \\"All I Want Is You\\" is simply a masterpiece.  With lyrics that remind one of Dylan, they spin out concisely the bottom line of what loved ones hold dear, only to show that it's all falling apart.  After the final screams of \\"All I want is 'your' love!\\" the Edge plays out a long and agonizingly intricate guitar solo with amps ridiculously turned up.  After that there is a beautiful orchestra suite to take us the rest of the way home.  Clocking in over six minutes, it has to be one of the great classics like Derek and the Dominoes \\"Layla\\".  But, like the Beatles on 'Abbey Road' they needed an ending.  With \\"All I Want Is You\\" they avoided an anti-climax and provided a brilliant bottom line to leave their show.
B00005JL3A|5.0|This definetly one of the best movies I have seen with the undead walking around. It gives you chills and cringes in all the right moments. No one watches these movies expecting to see academy award winning acting, so don't complain about it. But if you want good action with undead killing and people dropping like flys then get this movie. This is a really fun movie that you can watch again and again. The point of buying a movie is so you can re-watch it on a rainy day, so don't pass this up.
B0000648WZ|3.0|This is a cool movie, don't get me wrong.  But, it carries nothing of the book.  None of the socio-political undertones, nothing.  It barely even carries any sort of an us vs. them tone.  Its pretty much just a movie about killing bad guys.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|I will keep my review brief as everyone else shares their opinions of V and such...Bravo to the cast & crew of this fine film. A job well done.
B0000648WZ|1.0|There are two ways to review a film. One is in comparison with the book it is (supposedly) based on. The other is as a film in its own right. On both counts, Verhoeven's \\"adaptation\\" of Robert A. Heinlein's brilliant novel, Starship Troopers fails miserably.<br /><br />About the only things the movie shares with the far superior book are the title, some character names, and the situation Earth finds itself in. I almost said, the plot, but that wouldn't be true. The plot of the book is not \\"evil bugs attack beautiful movie stars costumed as futuristic soldiers.\\" The war with the Bugs is &lt;u>background&lt;/u> against which the plot (young man grows up and learns the price of civic virtue) is played out against.<br /><br />As a film, Verhoeven's waste of good plastic simply doesn't cut it either. Bad, wooden acting, from people who are such bad actors that they are simply stuck in roles (Neil Patrick Harris, aka after all these years still, Doogie Howser)springs instantly to mind. The special effects are awful and thoughtless, and have little to do with science and much more to do with bad fiction.<br /><br />I'd be inclined to give it '0' stars, but you can't do that.<br /><br />Walt Boyes
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I saw this film several months ago at a movie theater and its message and content have stayed with me. An Inconvenient Truth aids in understanding Global Warming. Global Warming is a real threat. Sadly still too many people are not paying attention to the destruction of the planet. I plan on buying numerous copies of this DVD as Xmas gifts this year to increase the awareness within my circle of friends. Collective action by all WILL make a difference. This is truly a time where positive action needs to be put swiftly into motion. Education is key and this film provides fascinating facts that everyone can learn from.

B000A0GXGA|5.0|I first saw \\"Maverick\\" the year after TV came to Adelaide and I had just entered my teens; in other words there were two reasons that might have influenced my high opinion of the show - TV was a novelty and I was very young. Decades later when the episode, \\"Full House\\" (25 October 1959; Season 3, Episode 7) was shown on the \\"Golden Years of Television,\\" I was delighted to find \\"Maverick\\" just as fresh and intelligent as I did at first. Brett was \\"still\\" that cowardly, opportunistic, but somehow lovable gambler aways blundering into scrapes.<br /><br />Brett cleans out a man at poker, but when the loser can't pay-up, Maverick takes his diamond horse-shoe stick-pin as collateral. The loser was reluctant to hand the diamonds over but NOT for the obvious reasons! You see, the man had a secret appointment to lead some of the worst outlaws in the West on a robbery; an \\"ensemble\\" of none other than Cole Younger, Sam Bass, Billy the Kid and Belle Starr! Of course, in the best Maverick tradition the only way these desperadoes can recognise the man was... you guessed it, the diamond stick-pin!<br /><br />Brett's sense of triumph over the hapless loser turns to horror when he realises what the stick-pin means. Ever the coward, Maverick hurriedly comes up with the most preposterous plan he can think of to discourage the outlaws  - robbing the Denver Mint.<br /><br />To Brett's consternation, the outlaws think he's brilliant and can not wait to get on with the robbery. The plan works, as it only could in the Maverick world, and Brett, ever the opportunist, says he'll meet them all at a given time and location to divide the spoils ~ then he telegraphs the Marshall's Office with the details of the meeting and where to send him the reward money for their capture.<br /><br />Earlier in the story, the local sheriff sees dubious characters arrive in town and decides to lock up the most suspicious looking of all - naturally this is Brett - while he sends for information. Brett is bored laying in his cell and reads the graffiti on the ceiling to entertain himself. He is startled by a limerick saying the cell door will lift free of its hinges. Brett is naturally doubtful, but scornful of \\"hicktown\\" ineptitude when it works.<br /><br />The outlaws are very impressed by his \\"daring\\" escape, which only serves to increase their trust in him and confidence in his robbery plan.<br /><br />I went into all of the above detail for the sake of people who don't know much about the Maverick format. Maverick, especially in the hands of James Gardner, had a unique, but above all INTELLIGENT, suspension of disbelief guaranteed to keep the show fresh.the graffiti on the ceiling to entertain himself.

B0000027RL|5.0|This was the debut by basically the only grunge band that's still thriving today. I'm not hugley into grunge, but this is still a damn good album. The only other grunge band I'm a fan of is Alice In Chains (who sounds more heavy metal, but whatever). I currently own 3 Pearl Jam albums (this, Vitolagy, and their newest self-titled), and even though I like Vitalogy the most out of the 3 (though all 3 are great), this is the one I've been listening to the most lately. Eddie Vedder is a great vocalist, second only to Layne Staley from Alice In Chains in the grunge genre in my opinion. Stone Gossard is one of the best guitarists out there. He has some great guitar solos on Once, Why Go, Porch, and Oceans. Jeff Ament is a great bassist, and he's very audible. Mike McCready is no no-name rythm guitarist, and sometimes he does dual solos with Stone. Dave Krusen is no Keith Moon or Neil Peart, but he still provides a suitable rythm section for the other 4 of Pearl Jam. The songs on this album range from upbeat and agressive (Once, Evenflow, Why Go, Jeremy, Porch) to dark and moody (Alive, Black, Oceans, Garden, Deep, Release), and it gives Ten a great mixed feel. I haven't 100% familiarized myself with the songs, but I can already tell you that they're all great. Even though all of the songs are great, my favorite would have to be Alive. From what I got from the lyrics, it's about a mother who tells her son that his dad is dead, and he wishes he was dead with him. The chorus, \\"I'm still aliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiive!!!\\" is great, and in my opinion, Stone delivers his best solo on the entire album.<br /><br />You can hear traces of Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Deep Purple, AC/DC/, Aerosmith, Black Sabbath, and other hard rock/heavy metal bands scattered all over Ten. But even with that, Eddie and co. don't rip them off at all. So if you want some awesome modern hard rock, get this album. It's the best album of 1991, and it gets my vote for the best debut of the whole 90s.<br /><br />P.S. When it comes to grunge, this annihilates Nirvana's Nevermind.comes to grunge, this annihilates Nirvana's Nevermind.
B000002KDO|5.0|This is a wonderful album, better than Paranoid because it's harder, meaner, has better tunes and doesn't have the embarrasing bits of Paranoid or other of their classic albums. <br /> <br />You can hear what influenced Grunge bands such as Alice In Chains (who supported Ozzy at some point in the early nineties) and Soundgarden. <br /> <br />There are some truly sublime moments on this album, and if you like some introspection and melody as well as their strangely upbeat, dirty chuggathons then you'll love this. <br /> <br />It's my favourite Black Sabbath album sofar after listening to Paranoid, Volume 4 and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, because the sheer quality is sustained throughout from beginning to end. Brilliant!!!

B0000648WZ|1.0|I you want to see a \\"cartoon\\" made from an excellent book this is an classic example.  The book has complex issues layed out for you to make a decision regarding their value.  Verhoeven makes those choices for you because he knows better than you what is \\"correct.\\"<br /><br />Vehoeven dislikes the people who guarantee your and his first amendment freedoms so much he disparages any and all warrior virtues.  Rather than spend your hard earned dollars buying this DVD, buy the book.  If you feel you have to compare the book with the movie get it from the local library for free.  This movie gets one star only because I am not allowed to post with a lower rating.<br /><br />This book follows about 70 percent of the plot with less than ten percent of the depth of the characters.  I enjoy Heinlein very much.  This movie trashed RAH's work so badly his wife Virginia had his name removed from the credits.
0553565915|5.0|I have no way of understanding how someone could not love such a life's work as this one. An artist might have to die to get famous, but what about those who die and come back?<br /><br />\\"Embraced by the Light\\" has helped many of my friends. One even said that my sending it to him helped his father travel out of this life in a cloud of peace.<br /><br />I believe that someone who is looking for an equal amount of understanding about what awaits us when we leave this life should love this book, too.<br /><br />Judging by the feeling that I get when I read this book, God endorses its content. Anyone have a problem with that? Then all anyone has to do is to die, come back, and tell us where we went wrong here...
B000GYI32M|3.0|I have been watching \\"The OC\\" since the very first episode.  In the beginning I literally feel in love with the characters, the amazing plot lines, and the spectacular writing.  It wasn't the fact that \\"the OC\\" was a posh television series, while I loved it - it was because it was one of the very few series that I could find characters that I identitfy.  Unlike 'Dawson's Creek' or 'Beverly Hills 90210,' 'The OC' had characters that could have been my friends, they where so alike to the typical teenagers of present time... I'm not saying everyone is rich and beautiful, but the are insecure, klingy, and come with baggage. <br /> <br />The third season of the series though had a definate drop in quality.  The creator took a backseat for the year, and the quality definately reflects his decision.  While all the characters have major choices and decisions in their lives - this is senior year afterall - its all left with an odd feeling behind. <br /> <br />Senior Year is suppose to be full of life-altnerning decisions and events and the series seems to kinda gloss over all these facts...  The episodes in the season include: <br /> <br />The Aftermath <br />The Shape of Things to Come <br />The End of Innocence <br />The Last Waltz <br />The Perfect Storm <br />The Swells <br />The Anger Management <br />The Game Plan <br />The Disconnect <br />The Chrismukkah Bar Mitz-vahkkah <br />The Safe Harbor <br />The Sister Act <br />The Pot Stirrer <br />The Cliffhanger <br />The Heavy Lifting <br />The Road Warrior <br />The Journey <br />The Undertow <br />The Secrets and Lies <br />The Day After Tomorrow <br />The Dawn Patrol <br />The College Try <br />The Party Favor <br />The Man of the Year <br />The Graduates
B000EMGAOY|5.0|A friend at work lent me his copy of this album to listen to yesterday and its very good! I like an album that has good songs on it and the fact that Red Hot Chili Peppers has been able to blend about 6 different music genres together. I read somewhere that the songs on this album were supposed to be released on 2 different CDs. However, I suppose Warner Brothers decided to release it as a double album. Works for me since this is a double dose of good songs from a great band. It may have been rough going for them at first to develop their sound but this album shows they have honed their skills in making their brand of alternative rock work. I was also glad to find out that the band resolved their differences after some brief infighting too. There was only one song I didn't like but all-in-all the tunes on this album are excellent and I definitely plan on making this album a part of my CD library! This, plus Pearl Jam's latest CD, are the top 2 albums out this year so far.
B0000648WZ|1.0|Morally complex film? For complex, and moral, read the book. The film is a piece of trash masquerading as a movie based on a great classic sci fi novel, with flat characters who don't even have enough depth to make you hate them, much less like them. Rating this 1 star because there's no way to rate it lower, don't waste your time with this one, especially if you've read the book it was supposedly based on.
0316172324|2.0|While Malcolm Gladwell's first book-length offering \\"The Tipping Point,\\" offered a few redeeming qualities from it's spectacularly non-groundbreaking ideas, \\"Blink\\" has nothing to offer people who have at least taken a high school psychology class. <br /> <br /> In one respect, Mr. Gladwell has performed a great public service: he has exposed the media as being full of dupes, willing to glorify anything in the field of non-fiction that presents a psychological theory, even an amazingly unoriginal one. As in Gladwell's first tome, \\"Blink\\" is a promoter of Freudian concepts -- an unconscious mind that has a greater influence over us than we're aware of, etc. \\"Blink\\" is a 280 page voyage through anecdotes that do absolutely nothing to bolster his claim. <br /> <br /> Let's take a public example. On Wikipedia, there is a summary of a story from Blink posted: \\"A researcher tells the story of a firefighter in Cleveland who answered a routine call with his men. It was in the back of a one-and-a-half story house in a residential neighborhood in the kitchen. The firefighters broke down the door, laid down their hose, and began dousing the fire with water. It should have abated, but it didn't. As the fire lieutenant recalls, he suddenly thought to himself, 'There's something wrong here,' and he immediately ordered his men out. Moments after they fled, the floor they had been standing on collapsed. The fire had been in the basement, not the kitchen as it appeared. When asked how he knew to get out, the fireman thought it was ESP, which of course it wasn't. What is interesting to Gladwell is that the fireman could not immediately explain how he knew to get out. From what Gladwell calls 'the locked box' in our brains, our fireman just 'blinked' and made the right decision. In fact, if the fireman had deliberated on the facts he was seeing, he would have likely lost his life and the lives of his men.\\" <br /> <br /> Perhaps the fireman knew that there was something wrong becausenormally the fire should have abated? Perhaps the fireman was so frazzled by the incident that he couldn't put all of his thoughts together at once? And maybe his gut reaction could have been wrong, too -- but it wasn't, so that's a non-story, and Gladwell wouldn't have material for this book that way. Day after day, gut reactions and first impressions are wrong, which could also fill up a book, but that doesn't make for an interesting read. I don't feel as if I can make this point as strongly as it deserves -- the floor might not have fallen through. His first impression might have been wrong. First impressions are wrong all the time. That, however, is a boring concept, and wouldn't make a best-seller. It would also require Gladwell to do some real research. <br /> <br /> Another anecdote that sticks out in my mind: Gladwell claims that if I were sitting in his office, and he read words such as Florida, denchers, Bingo, etc., to me, I would have walked out of his office slower than I came in because my \\"unconscious mind\\" equated those words with being elderly, so I would have assumed the role of an elderly person, whether I was aware of it or not. Oh, would I have? \\"Malcolm said so. That's enough evidence for me,\\" said the gulliable Gladwell fan. Even assuming I were to walk out slower, there are more factors than a few words that he said to me throughout the course of our conversation, which would have to carefully controlled, by his theory, to make sure he didn't say things such as \\"high school\\" \\"teenager\\" or \\"rock music\\" because then I would have assumed the role of a teenager, walking out of the room faster, whether I knew it or not, neutralizing the elderly feeling. <br /> <br /> This is so ridiculous that I feel stupid even trying to debunk Gladwell's claims. This should be obvious even to the most uneducated reader -- there is more than one factor involved in everything. (I'm trying not to impart my own cognitive psychological bias into this -- I'm willing to read serious works about psychoanalysis. Gladwell's book is not serious! No one who ignores factors that may diminish their argument should be taken seriously.) <br /> <br /> Theory is fact to Gladwell, the King of Pop Psychology, two books in a row. Maybe he \\"unconsciously\\" knows that it's wrong.

B000002VMH|4.0|It's always risky to close out an album with a novelty number as Annie Lennox does on this, her first solo release.  Actually, the very inclusion of a novelty tune at all is kind of chancy.  But thrown in as a closer, a jaunty bit of a lark can risk undercutting the mood of an entire album (at least for those who play CDs straight through these days).  And by rights, the capper on this album, a 1930s style chauvinistic chestnut called \\"Keep Young And Beautiful\\" could be said to undermine what is, after all, an otherwise moody and atmospheric set.    But, go figure, but it works perfectly.  You gotta hand it to the Scots siren, after a good deal of introspective sombreness, this bit of Jazz Age fluff is just about the cat's meow.      In fact, if the gorgeous gloom of the rest of the album (particularly as manifested on the tracks \\"Cold,\\" \\"The Gift\\" and the big hit \\"Why\\") was kind of starting to get oppressive, the closer not only makes for a lighthearted exit, but actually makes a statement of sorts about \\"womanhood\\" in the '90s (when the record was first released) and the pre-feminist early 20th century.    And that is simply this: as hard as it may be to be an autonomous, independent, and (yes) liberated woman, it's hands down better than having to \\"keep young and beautiful, if you want to be loved...\\"  Times have changed, and life and love have gotten maddeningly complex.  But would you really be better off with an empty head and \\"a Marcel wave in your hair\\"?  I didn't think so.    As for the rest of the album, well, it suffers a bit from saving much of the best stuff for last, including two of the three titles I cited above.  \\"Why,\\" of course, is the opener and it's just about a perfect pop record.  You fall into it and fall in love with it, even before you quite realize what it's about.  (I remember thinking it might have more social import or philosophical heft than it actually does:  songs with titles like \\"Why\\" sometimes do.)  But while I subsequently came to like the two or three songs that follow it well enough, they never seemed fully developed, never quite rich enough.  \\"Walking On Broken Glass\\" continues the broken heart theme of \\"Why,\\"  but its profession of heartache is (of course deliberately) set to a jarringly sprightly bounce of a melody and a kitschy ice arena arrangement.  Maybe it too should be viewed as somthing of a novelty tune.    DIVA has been hailed for its musical and lyrical spareness, as even the prosaic titles (\\"Precious,\\" \\"Cold,\\" \\"Primitive,\\" et al.) suggest.  Even when the title is a bit longer and more evocative, as for example \\"Legend In My Living Room,\\" the narrative can be a bit skimpy.  Starts off promisingly as a reminiscence of the singer's wild and wooly years and then devolves into so many \\"Have mercies.\\"  Tuneful enough, but there goes any hope of a grand statement, even if she does own up to being \\"the queen of doom\\"    But those gospel-styled shout outs do remind us of one Lennox's trademark stylistic devices (and, arguably, one her chief strengths).  She can sing big, and she can sing black, but it's always a least a little ironic and definitely cold cold cold.  I read once that she's been called the \\"white Grace Jones.\\"  But she's actually got a more powerful delivery than the devilish Ms. Jones ever did.  I'd call her more of a cross between Grace SLICK (now that would be a dream duet--Gracie and Annie) and Aretha (who actually did duet with Ann on \\"Sisters Are Doin' It For Themselves\\").  Heavy on the soulful inflection, even heavier on the irony.  If you hail from Aberdeen, and not Alabama, is there any other way to go?    Well, you can go one up on Sting, say.  \\"Why\\" wraps up with a letter-perfect Sting-style litany (\\"This is the book I never read/These are the words I never said\\").  It builds so dramatically, so authoritatively that you don't want to argue with its conclusion. Yeah, that jerk never had a CLUE about how she felt.  Of course, we never doubt her assertion that for her part, SHE could always read what her lover was thinking. She knew how HE felt.  Post-modern sexual stereotyping? Or just a simple truth about a specific relationship. And is the song autobiographical enough that that relationship was real, or is it a fiction? Dunno. Things were so much easier back in the day of \\"Keep Young And Beautiful.\\"
B0002KVUKM|4.0|If you like horror films, this one will give you plenty of it.  Every type of monster imaginable and then some!  The movie is probably 85% CGI - some of it really good and some bad.  Maybe a little too many monsters are included though.  Hugh Jackman was a good choice for the role of Van Helsing.  Good features, good sound, and anamorphic widescreen treatment makes it worth watching.

The message is government is not to be trusted, there really aren't any good guys left and US policy has been wrong since WWI when America dropped the bombs on Japan without thought for the millions who would suffer from fallout.  It gets even worse, Jimmy Carter is the best US president ever and our National Security  along with CIA and FBI are running rough shod over all those nice, peaceful, Muslims.

B000286S8S|5.0|BEST OF BOTH WORLDS, a two-disc set of Van Halen's greatest hits and album tracks, equally splits the songs between those sung by that annoying buffoon David Lee Roth and those fronted by Sammy Hagar, who rightfully believes that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia since 2005 for drug-smuggling was unjustly convicted; thankfully, the four new songs feature Hagar, not Roth, which makes this set a vast improvement over BEST OF, VOL. 1. People can complain that VH were never the same without Roth, but I don't take any stock in their whimpering and whining, and, in fact, those people don't deserve to waste our oxygen, because Hagar, besides being a better person than Roth, can kick Roth's butt as a singer any day. This is a great set, but you'd be better off buying the first three albums with Hagar instead.

I also have AMANDLA by Miles and that is my favorite CD by him.  Maybe I am not a jazz purest or something, but to me that CD lets you hear how truly great Miles was.  For some reason, finding AMANDLA on Amazon is a chore.  If you search Miles Davis audio, it does not show it, so you have to type in the CD title.
0316096199|5.0|I rarely find a book I just Cannot Put Down.  One of the rare ones was The Lovely Bones--and it wasn't just the plot.  It was the language, the crystal-clear voice-in-your-head narrative that spoke and spoke of pain and sadness and resolve.  It was infused with a realism and was both beautiful and haunting.  Like the lean, hard and seemingly lengthened muscles of a runner, Sebold's voice is discernable above the din of modern fiction yet it is not haughty or self-involved... Hearing her voice is like the moment you know you are going to be really good friends with someone you just met:  comforting and clear, it makes you want to lean closer to absorb it.  It made me a devoted fan of Sebold as I am sure you are, too.<br /><br />After having read Lucky, I now feel I know where that voice originated from.  This book is the literary equivilent of an armor-piercing bullet, and I found it beyond interesting that she took time out from writing The Lovely Bones to expunge her own memories from her narrative process--in other words, she felt she had to tell her full story in order to complete Susie's authentically in Susie's voice.<br /><br />To say that this was a gripping narrative, to say that it was moving, to say that it was a good read seems trite.  It was more like a shock to my system.  It made me more careful with my decisions as a woman and a mother and made me realize the profound effect of such violence.  Sebold's voice, like Melville's, is so full of astonishing truths that it cannot be ignored nor should it be missed simply because it isn't fiction.  There are real truths in this book that everyone should know.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this book is not for the faint of heart; it does indeed open with an extremely descriptive narrative of her rape and the subsequent trial.  Sebold details the capture, trial, aftermath and survival of her rape in such detail it cannot be described in a review--it has to be experienced for oneself.<br /><br />Please read this book:  it is a revelation.  Not a kind one, but a necessary one for both the author and ourseles.  I am immensely grateful to have found it, and for Sebold for having written it.  You won't be able to put it down.se read this book:  it is a revelation.  Not a kind one, but a necessary one for both the author and ourseles.

B000HT386M|5.0|I am puzzled as to the \\"professional\\" critics distain for this movie. When I saw it, the whole theater seemed to be laughing and crying right along together and there were applause at the end.. I personally loved the story of a man that could change his life by clicking a TV remote--and of course, learning that thinks are best left the way of fate. Great cameos by Henry Winkler, Christopher Walken and many others. There's a great digital sequence where the aging process was reversed; really quite something.  <br />I took a 16 and 13 year old with me and they both liked it, but thought it a bit heavy at the end. I think they were expecting more of a typical goof-off Sandler movie than this saga. There was a lot of bathroom humor (as you'd expect) and the dog humping the stuffed duck scenes are played over and over...but hey, all in all a really fun, funny flick! I can't wait to buy this to see the extras.

6305784116|5.0|Plot in a nutshell - Duchess (voice of Eva Gabor) is the well polished single mother cat of three little kittens. When their owner, the wealthy elderly woman known as Madame Adelaide, realizes that her time is running out she decides to write up her will, leaving everything she has to her cats, which will then go to her butler Edgar when the cats pass on. Edgar overhears this and is deeply offended by the idea that the cats would get everything before him, and plots to destroy Duchess and her kittens; he drops sleeping pills in their supper one night and then leaves them stranded in the French countryside. Out of their element, Duchess and her kittens befriend a street smart stray cat known as Thomas O'Malley (voice of Phil Harris who did the voice of the big bear Balloo in the Jungle Book); after making a pass at Duchess, unaware that she is a single mother, O'Malley decides to escort them back home, with Duchess genuinely falling for O'Malley as the usual codependent surrogate family bond develops; chaos and mayhem ensues, culminating in a violent clash between O'Malley, his brother cats from the streets and Edgar. Also features appearances by British geese, American southern hound dogs (what they were doing in France is anyone's guess), a mouse who sounds a lot like the rabbit from \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" (he was in fact voiced by the same guy who voiced Winnie the Pooh) and a horse. <br /> <br />Sometimes slow paced but still enjoyable Disney venture. Features the memorable \\"Everybody Wants To Be A Cat\\" musical piece sung by the late Scatman Crothers (better known to 1980s fans as the voice of Jazz on Transformers). Of course, if this was being made now, it would probably be a dark social commentary on class division represented by the divide between well bred & well fed Duchess and the street born O'Malley.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This album is, hands down, John Mayer's best work yet. What I love about this music is its reflectiveness and sensitivity, and I don't just mean that the lyrics are 'deep.' He finds a way to perfectly match those lyrics with the right musical sound at exactly the right moment, without being at all sappy or even remotely overdone. I think this might be one of those albums that people will be talking about for years to come not only because of its inherent excellence, but because of how it will have elevated John Mayer to status of musical legend.

B000FQJAIW|5.0|After reading various reviews of the second disc I decided to take the plunge and purchase episode 4, as a 'tester'. Like many, I was put off by the fact that the image is in the 4x3 'leterbox' format, but it blows up wonderfully on my 42 inch widescreen (HD ready) plasma and the picture quality is the same as most of my regular 'anamorphic' dvds. I am using HD inputs and my player has progressive scan.    The picture not being anamorphic doesn't seem to have made any difference - not to a regular viewer like myself who doesn't have top end equipment anyway.    The colours and tones of the picture are far better than the 2004 versions (not as lurid or likely to give the viewer eyestrain) and the Dolby 2 Surround sounds just as good as 5.1 to me. Spaceships still fly over my head and the sound fills the living room.    Honestly, I'm more than happy with these as my copies of the original theatrical versions. I've been though several of copies of bootlegs of these films (including an anamorphic version from the 1993 laserdiscs) and none of them has been a patch on the quaility of these official versions.    If you are wondering about purchasing this release and are worried about th image/sound quality, I wouldn't be. It's as good as any other dvd release - only the film itself is much better!! I'm an out and out Star Wars geek, and I'm more than satisfied with this!! I'm off to get the other two movies now I know how good the quality is.    Thanks to Lucasfilm for listening to the fans and releasing these versions. I'll stop complaining now!!
B00004Y6NU|3.0|After a rather long wait, Dire Straits' 1982 release Love Over Gold arrived in the mail this afternoon. It's not quite as well-known or best-selling an album as 1985's Brothers in Arms or 1980's Making Movies. However, Love Over Gold offers subtle nuances in its progressive leanings. Mark Knopfler continues to establish himself as one of the greatest emotive guitarists in rock history. That's a good thing. <br /> <br />The opening cut, \\"Telegraph Road\\", is an epic song about the industrialization of the world. Piano lines and the finger-plucked guitar soloing of Knopfler dominate musically, if they can be called \\"dominating\\" at all. This is not hard rock; this is rock music as art. It builds as the song goes on; it may be too long or too subtle for some listeners' tastes, but as a progressive rock fan and a Knopfler acolyte, I like it quite a lot. <br /> <br />\\"Private Investigations\\" follows, mellow as it begins, entering into a strummed, almost flamenco-flavored guitar solo over which Knopfler, in the character of a private detective, begins to speak. The song is basically instrumental, since there is no actual singing in it. After Knopfler's last spoken section, the character of the song changes somewhat, adding a steady rhythm section below the increasingly exploratory guitar. Soon enough, an electric guitar shreds in to add another layer, then the piano. As soon as they appear, almost, they are gone; and then back; the song continues in this way to finish. Definitely prog rock. <br /> <br />The third track, \\"Industrial Disease\\", takes up the familiar Love Over Gold theme of disaffect with the corrosion of the modern times in satirical fashion. The song is upbeat and rollicking, in contrast with its satirical but charged lyrics. Not my favorite on the album; not unlistenable, though. <br /> <br />\\"Love Over Gold\\", track number four and title track for the album, comes in with the piano again and adds the acoustic guitar in shortly. Knopfler's voice reinforces the quiet, hushed beauty of the Dire Straits ballad. It's about a spontaneous woman who acts boldly on flickers of passion and spurs of the moment; the last verse asserts that \\"It takes love over gold / And mind over matter / To do what you do that you must\\" and gives tacit approval to the fearless, unplanned actions of the character in the song. It's really a beautiful piece (there's even a marimba solo woven in there) and a new favorite of mine from the band... <br /> <br />The album ends with \\"It Never Rains\\", about a woman who lives life on the edge in a different way (or, perhaps, not in a different way but simply seen from a more critical perspective?) and does irresponsible and naive things that end up hurting the people around her and alienating the world. I think that Dire Straits does better when they try to be affective and evocative; as with the similarly up-tempo \\"Industrial Disease\\", \\"It Never Rains\\" is not quite as good or moving of a song as \\"Telegraph Road\\" or \\"Love Over Gold\\". It's not bad, though, as 'Straits rockers go. <br /> <br />Overall, I would recommend Love Over Gold to fans of Dire Straits or such other bands as Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, and Camel. It's only five tracks long (though all are long, one very much so), but the passages tying together all of them - save, perhaps, for \\"Industrial Disease\\" - are classic 'Straits, music as art and art as music. I guess that's what makes groups like this better for me than most of the heavy metal stuff that feels so much less passionate.
0375701427|2.0|American Pastoral was repetitious to the Nth degree. I read the Human Stain a few years ago, and it was good.  But, in Pastoral, the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the Swede and a psychoanalyst, and between his daughter Merry and a psychoanalyst, but absent the psychoanalyst: Roth is our psychoanalyst. What he misses, however, is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control. The Swede never failed as a father; rather, he failed because he couldn't let go of his sense of responsibility for her.

Sprinkled with 20th Century images of game boy escapism, drug addiction, Asian killing fields, chain saw massacres and perverse guardian angels, Garland updates the Blyton formulae with a 21st century horror ending.  <br /> <br />Gardland's writing is lucid with bite sized chapters but would have benefited from good editorial removing the inconsistencies that remind the reader this is just fiction.  <br />  <br />The Beach is a negative, reactionary tale that all marihuana destroys and all utopias become dystopia's because godless humans are flawed, dishonest and devious. The survivors find peace and security, working in mundane careers, in concrete jungles, worshipping the Money God. <br />  <br />Described a cult classic, a best seller, translated to film, Garland's success reveals a reality of our times: That deprived of adult responsibility, today's young adults read fiction of a kind written for yesteryears' children.  <br />
0143036556|5.0|How a society manages its natural resources, and how it responds to climate and environmental change, can spell the difference between its destruction or survival; this is Jared Diamond's essential message in Collapse. Dr. Diamond, professor of geography at UCLA, uses the example of a number of civilizations that either died out due to poor resource management and climate change, or survived through recognition of these problems and comprehensively addressing them.  The book brings to the forefront an important question: are we managing *our* resources wisely today?<br /><br />Collapse begins with an overview of the book itself, and, among other things, highlights five factors Diamond feels contribute to the downfall of the societies he describes. While four of these five factors aren't always present, he admits, the fifth one, how a society responds to the other four (climate changes, environmental damage, hostile neighbors, and access to or fate of friendly trade partners), is always a major factor in a civilization's rise or fall.<br /><br />After the introduction, the author begins his in-depth discussion with some of the environmental issues facing Montana today (esp. the Bitterroot Valley) and the impact these issues have on the local populace. From there, he goes into a short history of several past civilizations: Easter Island, Henderson and Pitcairn Islands, the Anasazi (a native American community that thrived in the southwestern US), the Maya, and the Vikings settlements in Greenland. He ends this section with a short review of successful societies: New Guinea, Tikopea, the Viking settlements in Iceland, and Tokugawa Japan. The following chapters are dedicated to some modern countries and their environmental problems: Rwanda, Dominican Republic and Haiti, China, and Australia. Finally, Diamond examines why failed societies made the bad decisions they did, discusses big business and the challenges corporations face in remaining environmentally friendly, and responds to common criticisms aimed at \\"dismissing environmental concerns\\" while contemplating where the world will go from here.<br /><br />It is obvious that Jared Diamond knows his subject and has done his homework. His discussion of the current issues facing modern Montana comes from discussions he has had with people who live there. The chapters on past societies provide an overview of these civilizations and the evidence that supports their destruction (or, in the case of successful societies, their survival). The sections on modern countries and their concerns is also well researched and provide an excellent overview of the tragedies and challenges these areas of the world have confronted and continue to face.<br /><br />In addition to his historical and contemporary expertise, Jared Diamond's past experience working with some corporations gives him another angle on environmental issues and allows him to provide another point of view that some other books on this topic may not address. While the author does not spare businesses that have made terrible environmental decisions, he also praises businesses that have made good environmental decisions, most notably Chevron's Kutubu oil field in Papua New Guinea. In fact, he points out how being environmentally friendly can be in the best interest of a company or corporation, especially when consumers demand such practices. Diamond also provides information on what consumers can do to influence business practices, and where to go for more information.<br /><br />In the final chapter, Diamond describes a potentially bleak scenario coming upon us relatively soon if nothing is done. These possibilities are pretty extreme, and while I'm not totally convinced that the worse-case scenario is around the corner, he's convinced me that there's cause for concern and action. Diamond also offers a good amount of hope as well, and he himself is \\"cautiously optimistic\\" that we will solve our resource management problems.<br /><br />Collapse is a very interesting study on the history of resource management, and a good warning to everyone about the possible consequences of failure. The book is well written, the narrative flows well, and the research seems thorough. It has succeeded in educating me about some environmental issues and has made me interested in digging deeper into this topic, a goal that I feel Jared Diamond had when he wrote Collapse.
B000BEZQ18|3.0|When a book or film becomes a 'best seller' it will have a variety of messages for different audiences. <br /> <br />The plot follows the consequences of one male cowboy being seduced by another.  <br /> <br />Superficially Brokeback Mountain says that even in the last vestiges of maleness, there are homosexuals.  <br /> <br />Brokeback Mountain also says that homosexuality is destructive and that homosexuals are a-moral seducers without any concern for the effects of their seduction on their victims or those who love them and their dependants. <br /> <br />There is no evidence that is more true of homosexuality or homosexuals than it is of heterosexuals. Seen that way Brokeback Mountain is homophobic.  <br /> <br />   <br />
B00005KHJM|4.0|I had always heard the original \\"The Wicker Man\\" was a classic horror movie.  I just recently saw the travesty of a remake with Nicolas Cage, and decided to see the original.  I have to say the original makes a lot more sense and was by far the better movie in every aspect.  The tale is one of mystery and faith, Christianity vs. paganism.  The scene between Lord Summerisle and Sergeant Howie absolutely makes the movie.  The scene with Willow trying to seduce the detective has to be one of the sexiest things ever on celluloid and manages it without being trashy.  Christoper Lee and Edward Woodward are spectacular as the leads and Brit Ekland is absolutely beguiling as Willow.  I did see the 88 min American release, which did seem to have some unexplained plot points, especially regarding Ed woodward's character Sgt. Howie but I am told there is an extended version that fills in some of the holes.  I definately hope to see that version in the near future.

The original theatrical release included on the \\"bonus disk\\" is perfectly watchable but sadly it did not get the treatment it deserved.  I have the 1993 remastered edition on VHS that was marketed as \\"The original trilogy one last time, (LOL!) and this DVD does look better than my old VHS.  To sum up: 5 star movie, minus one star for the sub par release of the original and minus another star for making me buy the \\"Special Edition\\" to get it.

0743454537|2.0|In this original emotional drama where a 13 year old girl faces the choice of becoming an individual by taking control of her body, or letting the leukemia affected sister she was conceived to help die, we find a controversial story told from the different perspectives of its characters (mother, father, brother, lawyer, etc).   <br /> <br />A 13 year old girl refuses to let her 16 year old sister have her kidney , and hires a lawyer to protect her right to choose.  She was conceived to become her sister's donor, and refusing her this is akin to sentencing her to death. Now she must face her mother's outrage in the ensuing legal battle. <br /> <br />A story with much potential, but which gives you the feeling of a script written for a commercial hollywood film.  The kind that wants to make you cry, that creates impossibly one sided individuals (the mother), a love story just for the sake of having one (the lawyer)and a shockingly out of place ending, which in my opinion at least brought an ounce of surprise into this otherwise predictable book. <br /> <br />This is the first book I read from Jodi Picoult, and I found that although the subject was thought provoking, and presented a situation impossible to imagine unless previously experienced, the telling was forced and wanting.

B00007AJF9|5.0|Very few historical movies are historically accurate. Who cares? That is not the point. If anyone relies on movie to get their history lessons, then they are pitiful in the first place. The primary purpose of movies is to entertain. Its likely that anyone interested in 'Elizabeth' is not the run of the mill 'Die Hard' fan to begin with, and probably has some true historical knowledge. Those seeking historical facts should visit their local library and stay away from the video store.
B0006AP1F8|5.0|i chose to recomend this book as it the only book about nazism that tells the truth.one thing i hate about books about hitler,nazi germany and ww2 is they are so mixed up between fact and fiction,it gets annoying trying to seperate the facts ftom all the bs.you will get only truths here.another thing i hate is lazy movie directors,producers and writers who always cop out on making a decent bad guy and use the old fallback of \\"i know!we will make him racist!\\"you will find none of that here either.just a mans view on a country he loved so much that he wrote it all down.before you write this book off as racist propaganda without reading it,remember who hitlers 2  friends were in ww2.italy run by a man who was half black and a japanese leader.if you want the truth read this book.if you want bs,get any other book on ww2 and read it.this is just another one of those \\"you cant handle the truth\\" things.

Unbelievably gross and repugnant human beings. Foul language abounds as do hateful people without morals or values. I didn't even make it to the half-way point of this film yet the extreme bad vibrations stayed with me for a good long while afterwards. Do yourself a favor, stay away from this cesspool.

The directing and screenplay (based on the short story Eisenheim the Illusionist by Steven Millhauser) by Neil Burger (whose first film was an cinema verite drama called \\"Interview With The Assassin\\" (2002), which he also wrote the screenplay to) is brilliant! Edward Norton (a two-time Oscar nominee for his work as Aaron Stampler in \\"Primal Fear\\" (1996) & Derek Vineyard in \\"American History X\\" (1998) & one of the best actors of our generation) gives the best performance of his career as Eisenheim the Illusionist (who was also coached by James Freedman). Paul Giamatti (recently Oscar-nominated for his performance as Joe Gould in \\"Cinderella Man\\" (2005) & was also one of Norton's classmates at Yale) equals his classmate with an impressive performance as Chief Inspector Uhl. Jessica Biel gives a great performance as Sophie, childhood friend and love of Eisenheim's. Rufus Sewell gives a deliciously excellent performance as the Crown Prince Leopold, Sophie's fiancee-to-be. The music by Philip Glass (another two-time Oscar nominee for his work on \\"The Hours\\" (2002) & \\"Kundun\\" (1997) is excellent!

B00005JKJA|5.0|MULHOLLAND DRIVE is one of the greatest movies of the last 30 years. Utterly compelling. First time I watched it, mesmerized but without really understanding it, the whole audience at the movie theater was speechless at the end, completely blown away. Naomi Watts gives one of the greatest performances of all time. Her character goes through the most amazing changes, all utterly convincing. Her \\"movie audition\\" is especially stunning. MULHOLLAND DRIVE is confusing the first time through, but after watching it a couple of times it all comes together. Unlike, for example, LOST HIGHWAY, this is a completely realistic plot, with no supernatural or unexplainable elements. Originally this was a pilot for a TV show a la Twin Peaks. Lynch then changed it to make it a movie, so there are some loose ends. There are also some lengthly dream sequences (Lynch gives only subtle clues to tell us that what's dream and real, but there are clues, and the distinction is clear), some flashbacks which are out of order, and some psychotic delusions presented from the perspective of the psychotic person. Nevertheless, the events are all completely possible (dreams do happen, people are subject to psychotic delusions, and memories or flashbacks can happen out of order), even plausible. Lynch gives us a terrifying look into the human psyche.
0618680004|5.0|I thought this book was fantastic.  That said, I'm not sure that Dawkins will accomplish his stated goal of convincing people to be atheists through this book.  In fact, I think those who profess themselves to be devout followers of any religion do more work in that direction--that is, convincing people that the Enlightenment still needs to be defended--than this book.  I read it, and enjoyed reading it, because I find any passionate defense of science and rationality to be a comfort in the current era of religious fanaticism. I think Dawkins' writing is lucid and often witty, a voice of reason in the wilderness.  Highly recommended.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|All I have to say is, I have almost NO issues with the new versions of Star Wars. But, to also finally have the original versions is also nice.<br /><br />What really annoys me is that people complained with Lucas not releasing the original versions of Ep. IV, V and VI. They complained endlessly on how he changed the sound, the special effects, etc. The only gripe I had was with switching Greedo shooting first instead of Han, but even THAT was minor and DIDN'T detract from the overall story for me.<br /><br />Now, Lucas releases the original stories. And what do the \\"purists\\" have to say? \\"WHY NOT IN DOLBY DIGITAL/THX 5.1??? That's all we asked for!\\" No, you asked for them untouched, unedited and that's what you got. The \\"purists\\" all stated they wanted the originals with the blemishes that were in them because that's what made the movies so special. Yet, they complain that he didn't digitally enhance the pictures to make it clearer, etc. Which do you want? Don't touch the picture (as many have stated that they want it blemishes and all) or do you want him to fix it? He already has - that's what the 2004 release on DVD was. Man, you just can't please anyone these days can you?<br /><br />For me, the 1977/1980/1983 versions look great considering the source - the original laser disc versions. The sound is NOT horrid, even though it's in 2.0. It's wonderful to see the movie in it's untouched glory, even though I enjoy the newer versions as well.<br /><br />I say, if you held off and didn't buy the 2004 release, here is your chance to get both versions. There is NOTHING wrong with owning both. The only thing you miss out on is the extra DVD that came with the 2004 boxed edition that contains a wealth of extra features on how the original trilogy was created.<br /><br />If you did buy the 2004 release and don't really care about the original versions of Star Wars, then this release is probably not for you. However, if you DO want the original versions in their untouched glory, here you go!

B000005HO0|5.0|OK the sound quality is very low and the production is very poor, but hey this live show was recorded not to be an album is because of dead's death that the band decided to make a tribute CD to him and of all their live recordings they made, Live in Leipzig got the best sound of all so they decided to make this show an official live album.<br /><br />Don't expect good sound of the musical instruments here. But dead's voice is very clear and loud. So I recommend this CD only to people that want to know how dead's voice was and how the band played some songs of de mysteriis with him.<br /><br />If you are new with this band don't listen to this CD yet, get  de mysteriis or deathcrush first and then if you like them and want to know about dead's voice then try this live CD

There either aluminum, cheap pot metal, or have some terrible hinge design (Zyliss and Oxo to name a few). I give the Rosle a four star because of it's design for very large hands - not very ergonomic. Check out the Kuhn Rikon. Either way, stainless and a hinged drop out sieve is way to go for any garlic press.
B000FVQM2Y|3.0|Well, its novel.  What kind of school are they running?  Quentin Tarrintino High?  You can't talk to Shaft like that!<br /><br />The story could indeed be the basis for a Noir-type film.  But a bunch of affulent high school kids talking in code  is a far cry from the clever, yet easily understood dialog one finds in a classic crime film.  On the other hand, Brick is very stylized, in a film school sort of way.  Unfortunately, this adds to the unreality of the whole thing. Its just odd.<br /><br />Loved the style; couldn't buy into the story.  So A for effort, B for uniqueness and C for entertainment value.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|I had no idea this was new to dvd.  Last week I saw the Roger Waters concert, and while that was great, I bought the dvd to compare Dark Side performances and what was on Pulse was outstanding, along with all the other songs.  The video is a bit hazy and I have high end video components.  That does not matter, get your dolby 5.1 going, set volume high and just listen to the sound bounce off the walls.  Gilmour's vocals and guitar work are outstanding.  Whether or not they over-dubbed some of the instrumentals, I don't really care.  Pink Floyd has always been perfectionists and they want to give us a quality product.   <br />I have given up hope of seen a full Pink Floyd reunion and the Live 8 performance is as close as we will get so in the mean time, get out and buy this awesome piece of work. <br />9.999/10...only reason is because of grainy video at times.

B0001XAPY2|4.0|I don't know anime, but I know what I like. Or do I? The idea of an animated feature about a pig flying an aeroplane sounded a little silly, but I actually found \\"Porco Rosso\\" pretty enjoyable. <br /> <br />The film, more or less, is about an expatriate Italian pilot of the 1930s who has the head of a pig, thanks to a strange experience many years ago. He's a bounty hunter who battles air pirates and rescues hostages. Even though it's a little tetchy and in need of a tune up, his red aircraft is beautiful and suits him very nicely. The pirates want him grounded and so do the Italian fascists (unless, of course, he decides to work for them). But no, Porco would \\"rather be a pig than a fascist\\", and continues to fly the skies solo, feeling sorry for himself in a gruff, quiet sort of way. That all may change soon, though... <br /> <br />I'm sure that this film wouldn't have been half as nice to watch if director Hayao Miyazaki wasn't so passionate about aviation and the Studio Ghibli team wasn't so passionate about motion. Though it isn't as colourful and strange as, say, \\"Spirited Away\\", it is a beautiful looking film, and has Miyazaki's signature style all over it. It's a film a more light hearted and sparse than his others, I reckon. There's not an awful lot that happens, and when it's often rather silly (especially with the air pirates). My brother was in stitches at some parts, actually. <br /> <br />The English dub features Michael Keaton as Porco. I thought it was him, but I wasn't sure until I checked the credits. Does a decent job, catches the surliness of the pig-pilot, but makes him likeable and friendly too. <br /> <br />It's good for what it is, light entertainment, and worth a look for anime fans, but if you're just getting into Hayao Miyazaki, I'd recommended seeing a film like \\"Spirited Away\\" or \\"Castle of Cagliostro\\" first.

0805066691|5.0|This is a fantastic classic detailing the demise of the plains Indians and deals with them incident by incident, tribe by tribe, chief by chief from around the 1850s to the early 20th century.    If the only good Indian was a dead Indian, and if civilisation was to prevail, this book is a stark examination of the lack of morality in the process, or at least the victory of might and legality over right.    One thing never mentioned in discussions about the US war of Independence is that the British wished to maintain treaties with the Indians and protect their land rights wheareas the Washingtonians were already in the process of making a land grab before the war took place.  The Indians took the side of the British and they had hell to pay long afterwards as they were wiped off the face of America, along with the Bison.    Geronimo, Sitting Bull and Custer's last stand.

B000GFLAI0|5.0|As a huge and long time Dylan fan, i love all of his work and this album is right up there with his best.  certainly equal to both Love & Theft and Time Out of Mind.  From the moment i put in on for me it was instantly likeable. Every song!   my wife who is not the Dyaln fan like me recognised this fact too. she instantly liked it from the get-go. its beyond me how anyone could say that this album is poor,or bad or even dreadful.  its totally worth 5 stars.   <br /> <br />as i grow older i realise how differewnt we all are as humans. i came to this review section of Dylans new work to expect everyone to think like me that this new album was brilliant and everyone to be rejoicing its existence.  alas not so. but overall 80% of the vote here is for another brilliant piece from Bob, and I agree entirely with the overall sentinment that this is a brilliant album.! <br /> <br />Bob has hit his purple patch of late in the last 6 yrs or so. and we're all the luckier for this, and this album is no exception. it has been in my car Cd player now for 2 weeks, everytime i get in the car it comes on again.  one generally gets sick of an album under these conditions....not this album !  I am still totally enjoying every bit of it 2 constant weeks in & out of the car all day long.  <br /> <br />what does that tell you about it ??  its great. for all Dylan fans, its a must have ! <br /> <br />For those complaining about his vioce after  all these years etc..... bob's voice has never been his jewel, but its all about the synergy of the Bob package, his unique voice is part of his attraction,...along with his song writing, his lyrics, his storytelling, his unique lyrical phrashing in songs, his guitar and harp playing and the enigma of Bob himself.  for fans this all adds up to what we love about him.  His voice is raspy but soulful, not pretty but uniquely Dylan. i love his voice always have.   <br /> <br />And this album for mine, sees his voice reaching levels it hasnt before.  his falsetto attempts are smooth and attractive touches. at 65 Bob is still doing a sterling job with what he has, if anything his vocal ability is improving. <br /> <br />Modern Times - very bluesy, instantly likeable, soulful, emotive, skillful and just damn good listening.  i like all the tracks. what else can i say. 5 stars - No Doubt !!!!!
0618680004|5.0|<br />There is so much here to agree with, it's fun to read.  Seldom have I come across a book that presents such a matter-of-fact scalding of the absurdities of religion.  \\"God Delusion\\" is simply an excellent book for those who share its views - or for anyone who has doubts and wonders what the \\"infidels\\" are thinking. But our old friend Richard Dawkins is probably preaching to the choir. If any devout believer actually condescended to try this book (like they were stranded on a desert island and there was nothing else to do), they would likely be quickly offended by the contents on any random page. I'll bet not 1 out of 100 fundamentalists would finish this book.  <br /> <br />\\"I don't believe in God because I don't believe in Mother Goose\\" - Clarence Darrow.  That statement would possibly also sum it up for Dawkins, were it not for his chosen profession.  Professionals in evolutionary fields have to put up with obstructionist tactics by religious groups far more than any other area of science.  Evolutionary theory is the backbone of all biological sciences, yet propaganda efforts to prevent the teaching of evolution in schools have goaded Dawkins into fighting back. <br /> <br />Different people around the world have written their own versions of God's book, each of them infallible, yet not in agreement with each other. The franchise leaders agree on mainly one thing - that they will not tolerate each others' brand.  All brands are strikingly uncontaminated by evidence. <br />   <br />The myth of Hell is a good example of the primitive thinking extant when these holy books were written.  It represents all the meanness, revenge, cruelty, and hatred man is capable of imagining.   The writers certainly created God in man's own image.  The Christian and Muslim communities wholeheartedly believe these prophecies, which announce that the vast majority of humanity will follow the wrong road and end up in the gruesome torture chamber of Hell. God knows who's going in advance.  Wouldn't a truly benevolent and omnipotent God let bygones be bygones and forgive those who, through merely an error of birth, adopted mistaken religious beliefs?  <br /> <br />The books were all written during the bronze age, or at least reflect that tribal mentality.  Many of the believers insist on taking their book literally. They tend to think humanity is basically bad and that following their brand represents the only hope that people will act ethically. They all advocate faith as the greatest virtue - that is, believing things that otherwise might get you medicated. Finally, all these believers of every brand get a free ride from criticism just because it's religion. <br />  <br />Whenever earlier humans lacked understanding, they created a \\"God of the Gaps\\" to fill the vacuum - the wider the gaps in knowledge, the greater the need for miracles (\\"GOTG\\").  Each forward step by science has further distanced the hand of God from perceived involvement in natural events. As humanity's deficits in knowledge have been replaced by scientific understanding, a GOTG has found fewer nooks and crannies where it can reasonably thrive.    <br /> <br /> The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States contain not a single word about Christianity, Christian principles, the Bible, or Jesus Christ (or Islam).  The Christian clergy of the Revolutionary period tried again and again to have references to Christianity inserted directly into the US Constitution, but they were refused every time by the Founders. Two items that may have influenced them were the Puritan practice of executing witches and King George III's absolute mandate that his subjects worship in a manner approved by the Church of England.  The Founding Fathers wisely established a wall of separation between church and state.  It allowed freedom of religion and freedom FROM religion.  The National Motto was not changed to \\"In God We Trust\\" until 1956.  The phrase \\"under God\\" was notadded to the Pledge of Allegiance until 1954. <br /> <br />I could natter on and on about the book, but this review is already too long.  Like Sam Harris in \\"The End of Faith,\\" Dawkins takes no prisoners.  I couldn't agree more.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />
B000001FI7|5.0|I have loved this cd for many years and while I do not listen to it very often it is one of my favorites.  It is the greatest cd to \\"get it on\\" to that I have ever heard.  Try it and you will agree
B000GG4KTU|5.0|Diana Krall beats anybody else in her Category hands down, and as long as her hands are down on those 88's, magic happens! Her song stylings are so unique, and full orchestra augments beautifully her sultry tones. Julie London and Jeri Southern come to mind, but Diana is in a class by herself. If you KNOW good music when you hear it, and APPRECIATE an Artist at work, you will UNDERSTAND and therefore love this CD. For those who \\"get it\\", no explanation is necessary. For those who DON'T, no explanation will do; (A note to Miss Krall's critics: IF YOU CAN'T SING OR PLAY AS WELL, GO TO YOUR ROOM AND STAY THERE!) For the rest of you, a standout track here is \\"How Insensitive\\", but you can't go wrong with anything on this 1st Class offering from one of Music's Finest!

B0000009TT|4.0|Much has been made of the record company's trifling with this material. I agree with those who see Zappa as a great musician and composer who just happened to have a tacky sense of humor. The all-inclusive character of this album is therefore a mixed blessing, but there is plenty to glean. Most of the best material was released on Sleep Dirt and Orchestral Favorites. Those albums captured the artistic range, without subjecting me to such gems as \\"The Illinois Enema Bandit\\" (in which I found more embarrassment than amusement).
0316172324|3.0|I thought that Tipping Point was a decent book (4 stars), and I was much more interested in the subject matter of this one, but it was kinda disappointing. The individual stories he uses to illustrate his points are informative enough, I guess, but I really don't think he has any business drawing conclusions from any of it. Unfortunately he just doesn't have the expertise, he's only a writer. Stil, I did read it all the way through, and got some interesting bits out of some of the experts he quotes. I got it fom the library and am glad I didn't buy it. Gladwell has potential, but whereas Tipping Point was on par, this one is a bogey.
0316172324|4.0|I would love to sit and have a conversation over lunch with Malcolm Gladwell - what an absolutely fascinating fellow. Gladwell's book is full of pointed epigrams that exemplify his theories on decision-making, as he's laid them all out in his book. I quite enjoy his method of telling these stories rather then simply outlining the theories themselves. Blink is a fascinating study in how one makes decisions using intuition and it's certainly quite thought provoking. Though the author does offer several conclusions at the end of his book, I do hope a sequel is in the works, as more of a \\"how-to.\\" I enjoyed Blink immensely; though I was left at the end wanting a bit more on how one might actually sharpen these skills, being now more aware of them. Absolutely worthwhile reading.

B0006399FS|4.0|As someone who has been listening to and buying the CDs of U2 since the Unforgettable Fire days, the band has taken many twists and turns, each of which was bound to disappoint one group of fans while impressing others. U2 has always been quick to experiment with new sounds and overall musical style. Sometimes this irks the fans of their \\"classic sound\\". For my part, I don't think anything they -or many other bands for that matter- will ever touch the utter beauty and completeness of The Joshua Tree. IMO, it's one of the 5 best rock albums over the last 30 years and probably one of the top 20 of all time. It was their Dark Side of the Moon. For the purposes of this review, TJT is the style of their music I like the most, though I also can get into Achtung Baby and even Zooropa when I'm in the mood (IOW, I'm not a \\"purist\\"; I try to leave myself open to their new sounds).<br /><br />With this album, it's sort of a strange mix between a much older, tried-and-true sound from the 1980s, along with some newer sounds that I really can't  get into. I want to like the album as a whole but really I find there are 4 or 5 songs I can listen to over and over, while the other ones don't do much for me. Those tracks are noted below:<br /><br />#5 - City of Blinding Lights - A very flowing, old-school U2 sound<br /><br />#6 - All Because of You - Bit of an \\"in your face\\" Rattle & Him sound with a streak of their previous album<br /><br />#7 - A Man  and a Woman - Another old-school sound, all the way back to Unforgettable Fire. Probably the most beautiful song on the album<br /><br />Rounded out by<br /><br />#8 - Crumbs on your Table<br /><br />#10 - Original of the Species<br /><br />#11 - Yahweh<br /><br />all of which are a sort of evolution of their old  sound, into something that blends well with their newer works like All that You Can't leave Behind.<br /><br />These six songs along make the album worth buying, but unfortunately for me it's not a start-to-finish listen. I went the iTunes route and got these six songs instead of the CD (thought I was tempted). Definitely worth a listen though to decide for yourself.iTunes route and got these six songs instead of the CD (thought I was tempted). Definitely worth a listen though to decide for yourself.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I am a fan of the old, raw sound of their first outings just as much as any other 'system' fan; but there is no doubt that 'Mezmerize' and 'Hypnotize' far surpass the former discs' musicallity and songwriting. 'Mezmerize' is the first disc in the 2005 SOAD masterpiece, and could easily be tagged as their best. I personaly look at 'Mezmerize' and 'Hypnotize' together as one album because they were recorded at the same time and I am thoroughly impressed. These two discs are metal masterpieces that will most likely never be forgotten...don't miss out.
B00005JO20|1.0|Well, I just watched this very long movie with my wife and after more than three hours, we couldn't wait to see if ANYBODY had actually given this movie a positive review. As you can see elsewhere, people did! I cannot posibly imagine why and after reading these reviews I can only conclude that these people must have watched a completely different movie! This is the most ridiculous, drawn-out schlock I have seen in a very long time. It is so incredibly trite and exaggerated that I couldn't help but roll my eyes and laugh out loud that valuable resources were wasted to make this. The movie is as gripping as watching someone fly-fish! Had I had the misfortune of watching this in a theater, I would have walked out. <br /> <br />I give Jackson credit for his work on Lord of the Rings but after this, I can only hope that he is not allowed to ever make another movie again. But what do I know, I'm just some guy who enjoys good movies. This one easily makes it onto my Top 10 worst movies to ever hit the Big Screen. Zero Stars!
0790729342|5.0|Following the success of MAD MAX, director and writer George Miller re-teamed with Mel Gibson to make this follow-up to one of most successful and profitable independent movies in history.  Originally titled MAD MAX 2, the movie was retitled ROAD WARRIOR for the American release because though MAD MAX had been a huge success overseas, it hadn't made it beyond art house theatres in the U.S.<br /><br />For those who have seen MAD MAX, ROAD WARRIOR offers some subtle nods to the past film, such as certain designs in Max's outfit and the famous Interceptor that he drives.  Yet, ROAD WARRIOR isn't the type of sequel that requires the viewer to have seen the previous picture.<br /><br />The vicious and gritty world of Max Rockatansky has taken a turn for the worse in ROAD WARRIOR.  The world is even more chaotic and petrol has become more precious than food or water.  Max has become a lone wanderer, traveling from place to place, fighting just to survive.  He believes that his past days as a man of law and order and who fights to do the right thing has been put behind him.  After an interchange with some new bandits, Max finds himself in the midst of small group of good and honest people who run a small oil refinery.  Appealing to his sense of law, goodness, and justice they convince him to help them in making their escape from a cut-throat gang of bike terrorists with their entire fuel supply.<br /><br />ROAD WARRIOR was the movie that basically introduced Mel Gibson to U.S. movie audiences and it was the film that made him a star.  It was the most successful of the Mad Max films and for good reason.  MAD MAX was a very good post-apocalyptic movie, but the movie had its limits.  For instance almost 2/3rds of the planned chase and action scenes were cut from MAD MAX for budget restrictions.  In ROAD WARRIOR the filmmakers were able to do many of the things they weren't able to in MAD MAX.  Almost a third of the movie involves a massive chase sequence with a giant tanker, motorcycles, dune buggies, and sundry other vehicles.  The action sequences are intense and full of adrenaline.  The script is a more concise than in MAD MAX as well as less complex.  Max's character is established early on and because this is just one incident in the legend of the \\"Road Warrior\\" very little other characterization is needed.  The acting in the film isn't anything extraordinary, but it's not as cheesy as it could have been (see the MAD MAX BEYOND THE THUNDERDOME for that).<br /><br />Overall an exciting post-apocalyptic movie that is full of action and a massive car chase in the desert.  Recommended for fans of sci-fi and action movies as well as people interested in Mel Gibson and films that have a side note in movie history.nker, motorcycles, dune buggies, and sundry other vehicles.

0393327655|2.0|Page 129. Chapter on The Problem with Islam. <br /> \\"In such a situation [if an Islamist regime...ever acquires long-range nuclear weaponry] the only thing likely to ensure our survival may be a nuclear first strike of our own. Needless to say this would be an unthinkable crime - as it would kill tens of millions of innocent civilians in a single day - but it may be the only course of action available to us, given what Islamists believe.\\" <br /> <br />Page 28, 29 Chapter on Reason in Exile <br />\\"To see that our problem is with Islam itself, and not merely with \\"terrorism,\\" we need only to ask ourselves why Muslims terrorists do what they do.... They believe in the literal truth of the Koran.\\" <br /> <br />Page 93, Chapter on The Shadow of God <br />\\"The gravity of Jewish suffering over the ages, culminating in the Holocaust, makes it almost impossible to entertain any suggestion that Jews might have brought their troubles upon themselves. This is, however, in a rather narrow sense, the truth.\\" <br /> <br />I looked forward to reading this book that a dharma friend encouraged me to review. The book has received glowing reviews from the \\"rabbis of reason\\" in the Western media, including The Independent and The Guardian newspapers in Britain, the New York Times, San Francisco Chronicle and The Economist, as well as the book receiving the winner of the prestigious Pen Award for non-fiction. Some Buddhist teachers and senior practitioners have also read the book. <br /> <br />There is certainly a necessity to explore the relationship between religion and reason, religion and terror, beliefs and science. In his book, Sam Harris, has written a vigorous and brutal rebuttal of religion with Islam serving as his prime target for condemnation. He looks at religion through the eyes of an American citizen, conditioned by the government/corporate/media standpoints, US training in Western philosophy and doctoral studies in neuroscience. His saving grace appears to be contact withBuddhist retreats and teachings from the East. Up until page 204, when he explores the significance of Eastern teachings, the book appears to have been written by a hardcore, secular fundamentalist - an articulate anti-religionist showing the same kind of prejudice as someone stereotyping people of colour. <br /> <br />There are approximately 100 pages out of 352 pages referring to the Koran. How many references to The Torah, the five books of Moses, held sacred by people of Jewish faith? Only one. That single reference appears on page 296 in the footnotes concerning the meaning of a Hebrew word. There is no reference in The End of Faith to circumcision, a religious commandment carried out on a seven-day old boy (Gen. 17:10-14 and Lev. 12:3). The covenant for mutilation was originally made with Abraham. It is the first commandment specific to the Jews, and circumcision is still routinely carried out on nearly all young US citizens. Nor does the book refer to the common view of Christianity, Judaism and Islam that human beings have souls but animals do not - a view that permits imprisonment of animals (zoos, circuses, sports, factory farms), and condones hundreds of millions of animal experiments worldwide by scientists). Overall, Buddhism and Hinduism get off lightly at every level compared to the three main monotheistic religions. <br /> <br />There is no real examination of the American based, born-again Christian movement that exercises much influence on the foreign policy of the White House, especially in the Middle East. This powerful and wealthy movement is fervently pro-Israel, believes in The Rapture (that born again Christians will be suddenly swept up in a single moment into Heaven) and that the United Nations is the anti-Christ. These evangelical Christians also believe we are near to Armageddon as God's plan for a global showdown between good and evil that will start in Israel, the coming of the Messiah and the Final Judgement by God at the end of the world after the resurrection of the dead. <br /> <br />Sam Harris devoutly believes that religion is primarily responsible for the suffering in the world (not human behaviour, not stereotyping of people, not violent views, not the dualism of us and them, not prejudice, not dehumanising of people and their faith, not clinging to beliefs, not use of science and reason to wage war by the State or organisation, not the ideology of the Nation State, not the sickness of capitalism or political authoritarianism). <br /> <br />Certainly religion needs urgently to engage in deep soul searching, draw on far more deeply on the power of love, hospitality, generosity and selfless service, as well as the power to transform lives. There is also an urgent need for discourse to try to comprehend the hearts and minds of believers in religion and reason. The best of science has a legitimate perspective on Truth, but so does religion, awareness, art, love, meditation and consciousness altering experiences. <br /> <br />However, again and again, Harris slips into crude generalisations and jaundiced reasoning that undermine his argument to the point that he loses credibility. <br /> <br /> \\"Some propositions are so dangerous that it may even be ethical to kill people for believing them (page 52-53) ... Certain beliefs place their adherents beyond the reach of every peaceful means of persuasion, while inspiring them to commit acts of extraordinary violence against others..\\" <br /> <br />Here Harris shares the same view as fundamentalist Muslims. Fanatical Muslims know that after 9/11, more than 90% of the US population supported the war against Afghanistan, and the majority of US citizens still support the daily violence upon parts of the Islamic world.  Terror feeds terror. <br /> <br />I recall a close associate of the Buddha saying to the Buddha that nobody in the world had the wisdom of the Buddha. The Buddha replied: \\"I didn't know that you had met everybody.\\" Sam Harris needs to liveamong countless welcoming and forgiving Muslims in the Arab world, spend time with Jews in Israel working to heal suffering - a core tenet of their faith - and experience in every corner of the world the selfless love of Christians, many of whom have never converted anybody to their faith. <br /> <br />In numerous places, Sam Harris has quoted from religious texts to support his condemnation of religion. Here are a few quotes from The End of Faith. Readers can make their own mind up whether these statements are true or not, and decide for themselves whether to conclude, as I do, that such statements show the author's tendency to slide into a demonization of religion. <br /> <br />Page 13 <br />\\"...most of the people in this world believe that the Creator of the Universe has written a book.\\" <br /> <br />Page 28. <br />\\"Insofar as a person is observant of the doctrine of Islam - that is, insofar as he really believes it - he will pose a problem for us (Americans).\\" <br /> <br />Page 14 <br />\\"...the very ideal of religious tolerance ... is one of the principal forces driving us towards the abyss.\\" <br /> <br />Page 14. <br />\\"We can no longer ignore the fact that billions of our neighbors believe in the metaphysics of martyrdom, or in the literal truth of the Book of Revelation, or in any of the other fantastical notions that have lurked in the minds of the faithful for millennia - because our neighbours are now armed with chemical, biological and nuclear weapons\\" <br /> <br />Page 92 <br />\\"Anti-Semitism is as integral to Church doctrine as the flying buttress is to a Gothic cathedral....\\" <br /> <br />Page 143 <br />\\"For it [pacifism] seems to me to be a deeply immoral position...\\" <br /> <br />Page 143 <br />\\"What we euphemistically describe as `collateral damage' in times of war is the direct result of limitations in the power and precision of our technology... [If] we had possessed perfect weapons... there is no reason to think that he [President George Bush] would have sanctioned the injury or death of a single human being.\\" <br /> <br />(Reviewer's note: Has nobody informed the US President - or Sam Harris - that USA, UK or Israel has launched bombs, including cluster bombs, missiles launched from air, land and sea, tank attacks on cities and villages have killed and maimed more than 100,000 innocent men, woman and children in four Muslim countries, namely Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon and Palestine, in the past five years? This level of so-called `collateral damage' indicates a deliberately destructive use of technology, not simply its lack of precision. There seems to be an Anglo-American `jihad' upon Islam. <br /> <br />There are probably more men, women and children, inspired by their faith, per population, engaged in non-violent demonstrations in Palestine than anywhere else in the world - on a single issue (to end the occupation). Harris regards total commitment to non-violence as `immoral'. In Nablus, Palestine, I have met with `families of the martyrs' - those who have suffered through injury, mutilation, arrests, assassinations, shellings, bombings and suicides. I have stayed up half the night listening to their heart-rending stories. <br /> <br />I have been left wondering at how relatively few acts of suicidal revenge there are. On average about eight Palestinians per year have become suicide bombers since 1994, out of a population of more than three millions Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza. Since the year 2000, 4217 Palestinians, including 779 Palestinian children have been killed, 30,174 maimed or wounded, 8600 men and women stay imprisoned and perhaps 10% per cent of the population traumatised by the military occupation. More than 85% of suicide bombers have lost loved ones, mostly family members. These bombers have left Israeli families experiencing the same grief.  While needing to take care with making universal moral judgements to support war or pacifism, many of us who have directly witnessed violence find it abhorrent, no matter what the means. <br /> <br />Political militants from more than 30 countries have used suicide bombings in the last decade around the world. The Koran explicitly forbids suicide - a different view than the Buddha. In the Nablus meeting, I have told the Palestinians that I do not support the throwing of a single stone at an Israeli soldier, let alone keeping open the option of Sam Harris of a nuclear first strike on the Middle East. Unwavering dialogue and liberation from terror inflicted by the nation state and by the organisation is the way forward. <br /> <br />Has Sam Harris ever sat down and listened to the voices of oppressed Muslims? No. If he had, he would surely have written a different book. <br /> <br />Sam Harris then goes on to advocate a `truly rational approach...with `an open mind...in favour of free and vigorous inquiry.\\" He does point out deep concerns that thoughtful people have about religion, and that is to his credit, but he despises religion and instead worships technology and reason. He falls into the trap of believing that people of faith are the infidels. It's much more complicated than that. <br /> <br />The author believes that \\"Science will not remain mute on spiritual and ethical questions for long\\" and believes that `we can see the first stirrings among psychologists and neuroscientists of what may one day become a genuinely rational approach to these matters...\\" (p43). It is an optimistic thought but somehow I can't imagine that when this great day comes we will all be dancing in the streets. <br /> <br />OK, we throw away all religious books, become converts to the beliefs of contemporary science, accept the earth is actually four billion years old, uphold the Big Bang Theory, DNA and evolutionary theory of struggle of all species, and meditate, supported with rationality. Will peace and harmony reign on the world? Will everybody suddenly receive food, clothing, shelter and medicine? Will our belief in science stop consumerism, addictions and despair? Will it stop the depression, fear, violence, murders, self mutilation and suicides in our secular, self obsessed and science based society? <br /> <br />The world's religions will still be with us until the end of time, staring us in the face, with all their rational and irrational beliefs. Religion and reason, faith and science serve far too much as a backdrop to our perceptions. Sacred books and religious traditions stand void of significance until we give them attention and make something of them - for better or worse. We need non-dual wisdom in this world, not submission to religion or science. <br /> <br />Trapped in libraries of knowledge in universities, spellbound by thought, and cut off from the real world, those who demonise religion seem unable to come to terms with the fact that religion is here to stay; neither Communism of the Russian or Chinese variety that banned religion and based itself on scientific materialism, nor Fascism that replaced the crucifix in school classrooms with a photograph of Hitler, nor the ideology of Pol Pot that attempted to exterminate Buddhism in Cambodia, nor Western science, nor capitalism, nor globalisation, nor this era of Western `enlightenment' has made any inroads to destroy people's beliefs, trust and experience in something  greater than themselves. Religion is here to stay and so is political reasoning. <br /> <br />Despite the nonsense, naivety and dangerous claims to be found in religious books, and in the variety of religious forms, religion holds a deep, somewhat inexplicable appeal to millions upon millions of people. There is a bizarre attachment to certainty in humanity - and religion offers it - and it does carry real danger -- but so do our political leaders. Sam Harris simply doesn't understand people of faith. <br /> <br />Despite his contact with the Buddhist tradition, Harris has sadly ignored the Buddha's core teachings on looking into the truth of one's experience, and opted instead to support the stereotypes of people's faith. On August 17, 2006, the USA Today daily newspaper reported that 39% of US citizens felt at least \\"some prejudice\\" against Muslims and favoured the suggestion for Muslims in the USA to \\"carry a special ID\\" as a means of preventing terrorist attacks in the USA. In a letter to the newspaper, one reader said she was \\"absolutely horrified\\" at such figures from the poll. It reminded her of Nazi Germany. Sadly, this book feeds such fears. <br /> <br />The author finds fault with the French philosopher, Jean Baudrillard (page 138), Mahatma Gandhi (page 202), Noam Chomsky (page 140), Arundhati Roy (27-28), and unwavering commitment to non-violence (page 199). He selects a piece from their vast array of writings to show their \\"wayward thinking,\\" as he refers to Chomsky. <br /> <br />In the closing chapter (Experiments in Consciousness), Sam Harris turns his attention to the search for happiness, the spiritual tradition of inner change, the power of consciousness and meditation. Here he makes numerous excellent points that deserve wider attention and exploration. On these themes, he seems more grounded though he believes that such experiments need to be conducted in a \\"rational manner.\\" But who determines what is rational? <br /> <br />Harris writes (page 219): \\"A vast literature on meditation suggests that negative social emotions such as hatred, envy and spite both proceed from and ramify our dualistic perception of the world.\\" <br /> <br />So don't delay, Mr. Harris. Stop reading your newspapers. End your belief in second hand knowledge. Meditate. Meditate. Meditate. Then go and live with our brothers and sisters in the Muslim world so you can find a way out of your obsessively dualistic perceptions against Islam and other religions. I hope you will one day employ your considerable writing skills to write a book on the same theme with love, compassion and wise analysis at the heart of it.<br />

I hated how this girl was acting and how she was so materialistic it made me sick.<br /><br />Then after getting more into it, I liked how the character changed before my eyes and I really enjoyed how she did end up and with whom.  I really recommend this book for people whom have either been a materialistic girl or whom have known girls like her because you will definately enjoy this book.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|We have Director's Cuts and Extended Editions. The former is usually what the director initially intended before studio executives got ideas about what the film should be while the latter is usually an optional version, a \\"if you want to, here it is\\" cut of the film. Before we had Gladiator getting an extended edition which oddly didn't work out in its favor and we have the director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven which is probably even better than the normal cut than previously thought. <br /> <br />It's 1181 and Balian is in a particular depressed mood. His son died and in her grief, his wife committed suicide which is a big Christian no-no. He comes across his father, Godfrey, and he finds out that he can potentially right his and his wife's problems if he goes to Jerusalem only things aren't so great there. King Baldwin has leprosy and his health is deteriorating and there's a power struggle on who will be the next King. Meanwhile, Muslim hero Saladin wants Jerusalem for him and his people and 200,000 people are on their way to take it. <br /> <br />Some longer versions of the film merely add to one of the film's problems or corrects them. Gladiator, awesome in its battle scenes but uninteresting in its political intrigue scenes, got even more of them in the extended cut. With this film, we get more insight into characters that maybe aren't as strong either way. For example, hero Balian is somehow who firmly sets himself in ideals yet he sleeps with a man's wife but he won't take up the crown and marry that man's sister and have him executed even if said man is power hungry. He just never really was much of an interesting character to begin with and seeing more of his moral flipflopping was odd. <br /> <br />Maybe it's just getting old now but seeing 200,000 men descend on another large group of men and wage war isn't as thrilling anymore. Yes it's visually impressive but after seeing it in all 3 Lord of the Rings movies, then Troy then some others I probably haven'tseen, it's just not as stunning to see. However, the scene itself works well with brutal combat and flaming fireballs and large towers(too LotR there too) and instead of admiring the effects, I just simply watch it. However, you'll usually get great visuals from Ridley Scott's movies and this one has it with some striking cinematography shots of landscapes. <br /> <br />Acting-wise it's straight across the board with particular attention to Edward Norton as King Baldwin who, like Hugo Weaving in V for Vendetta, manages to be captivating even when his face is shielded by a mask. However it only falls apart once but it's in a key area: the casting of Balian. Despite a fluttering moral compass, it's our main man and Orlando Bloom just simply doesn't cut it. Yeah the guy can fight but he's not as emphatic or charismatic. <br /> <br />You should definately check out the film and rid yourself of the memories or thought of its much-maligned theatrical cousin and watch this instead.

B00005MP58|5.0|I could watch this movie again and again and never get tired of it. The acting, the music, the scenery...everything is fantastic.    Pride and Prejudice is funny, romantic, entertaining..it's focus is the upper-upper class of England in the early 1800s...people who are so wealthy that no one needs to work and they can focus entirely on leisure and courtship.     The matriarch of the Bennett family is set on getting all of her daughters married off and this story revolves mainly around her two eldest daughters, and their relationships with Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy. The story also covers the lives of the two youngest, and silliest, Bennett girls and the extremely serious Mary Bennett. Of course, the ultimate plot line is the love-hate relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy.    I am normally not interested in period pieces and turned this movie down at first. I'm very glad I gave it a chance because it tops the list of favorites now.
B00000J7SS|5.0|This album is just brilliant! <br /> <br />I grew up with rock music, and am just now dipping my feet into the world of jazz. <br /> <br />It sounds like it was recorded tomorrow, and it probably still will in another 40 years. Beautiful and abstract, this is a true masterpiece. While borrowing from the worlds of jazz, funk, and psychedelic rock, it won't be confused with any of these styles. <br /> <br />Although some reviewers have said it took a while for them to appreciate, I was blown away immediately on the first listen. However, I've been seeking out \\"challenging\\" music, so this was what I was hoping for. I honestly didn't know what this would sound like, I bought it on faith, preferring to be surprised. It's not like anything else I've ever heard before, which is actually pretty amazing considering the homogeneous state of various musical genres. <br /> <br />It's definitely not for everyone. But then again, Britney Spears and Bud Lite are for everyone. This is for discerning listeners who want to be taken to an amazing place.
B00001QGPS|4.0|Two very skilled MC's over some bangin production. Whether you're a Mef fan or Reggie's you'll both agree that together they make unstoppable records. Anyone seeking an ill listen throughout the length of an album will be completely satisfied.
B00005JP87|5.0|Set in Vienna, filmed in Prague,and just about as lovely as anything I've seen on the large screen, \\"The Illusionist\\" stars Edward Norton as a charismatic magician, and Jessica Biel as his high-born love interest. In keeping with its magic and later, occult, theme, the film unwinds through shadow and darkness, like a carriage being horsedrawn through fin-de-siecle Europe's narrow streets.  Philip Glass's minimalist score, rather than acting as an anachronism as one might expect, enhances the ethereal, other-worldly quality.  Edward Norton brings to Eisenheim, the central character (the book is based on the short story \\"Eisenheim, the Illusionist\\", by Steven Millhauser)an understated quality that adds to the sense that he always knows more than we do...and more than the characters in the film, including the two that most want to undo his works of magic, Inspector Uhl and Crown Prince Leopold. Unfortunately, the latter is engaged to Dutchess Sophie van Teschen, Biel's character.  Leopold's intent is not only to prevent his lower class rival's success, but to control Sophie completely.  Uhl, on the other hand, continues to respect Eisenheim, even as he is carrying out the Crown Prince's orders to shut the magician's show down.<br /><br />As the tale unwinds (and it does ever more quickly as it moves toward the end), we do learn more and more about what lies behind Eisenheim's sad eyes.  When Sophie's body turns up in the river after an argument with Leopold, Eisenheim's shows take on a dark change and he becomes kind of a \\"John Edwards\\" of the 19th century...but this John Edwards can summon holographic ghosts onto the stage, much to the delight of his audience.  Is he becoming more and more obsessed and perhaps insane as Sophie begins to appear in these seances?  In a twinkling, we find out as much about Eisenheim as we have during the entire film, and the lines in the Sophie-Leopold-Eisenheim triangle between the innocent and the devious aren't so clear.<br /><br />A film to be savored./>A film to be savored.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|This will sound crazy to everyone except those like me, but I have become an HP 12C FANATIC because of this calculator. I have gone through the entire manual (with the exception of programming) and thoroughly enjoyed learning all of this calculator's features.    Prior to owning the 12C Platinum, I used a Sharp EL-733A. The 12C is 10 times the calculator that the 733A is. The bond and depreciation functions are excellent and the 12C is much faster than the 733A.    Most finance professors will tell you that by simply walking into a bank with this calculator you are already a step ahead. One professor claimed that you didn't even have to know what you were doing - just press a few buttons in front of the loan officer and they will know they're dealing with someone that knows the language! Instant loan approval!    The 12C Platinum Anniversary Edition is a sharp looking instrument with tons of features. The second and third functions above and below each key are easy to read on the black background.    I find the undo and backspace keys rarely useful, and algebraic mode is pretty much useless if you are an RPN-guru or to those that will take a few minutes to learn RPN.    It is hard to beat the classic Gold 12C, however. The only reason that I would rate the 25th Anniversary Edition higher than the original is because of the faster processing rate. HP's claims are dead-on; I measure this calculator to be 5-6 times faster than the original in most all instances and sometimes faster than that. I believe the faster speed is reason enough to justify the extra cost.    That being said, I loved the 25th Anniversary Edition so much that I ordered the original Gold 12C just a few days later! I had to compare the two, and I thought it would be nice to have a spare.    Either way, you can't go wrong with the HP 12C!
B000GPIPVU|4.0|It may not be the best idea to get music suggestions from Kelly Clarkson, but after hearing her perform Shelter, I just had to find out more Ray LaMontagne, the guy who wrote the song. Then throw in his contribution to Zach Braff's latest mixtape aka the soundtrack to The Last Kiss, just made me even more intrigued. So there were high hopes going into his sophomore album Till the Sun Turns Black. The album doesn't have anything to instantly attach to like Shelter or Hold You in Your Arms, but the earthy songs on the set are each enduring in their own ways. For most of the album, it sounds as if Cat Stevens had grown up in the American wilderness giving him more of a raspy voice and Ray knows just when the right time to add some strings or horns for the best effect. <br /> <br />The album starts off with the sparse and airy Be Here Now where Ray barely lifts his voice above a whisper the whole song. Empty picks things up, but just a little as the acoustic guitar drives the song more. The funk starts with Three More Days as you can feel through the speakers just how much Ray wants to get back to his lady. You Can Bring Me Flowers continues along that line but with the bass guitar as the star of the song making more dirty than all the other songs here. Gone Away From Me feels like an old folk song that could have fit in with anything Pete Seeger did. The combination of the title track bleeding into Without Out is a great epilogue to the album with the latter having the simple lyrics of, \\"War is not the answer, the answer is within you.\\"
0061150142|5.0|This book was haunting and somewhat disturbing-yet I could not put it down!  Ms. Picoult has really sucked us into the lives of the Hartes and the Golds and how one event is interpreted by different members of the families.  The issue of teen suicide is a hot-button topic and is well researched and written.  The thing is with this book is you realize that there cannot be a \\"happy ending\\" but you still are hoping for the best. Bravo Ms. Picoult!
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|The best film of the year, with a powerful performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Anyone who has seen this movie will agree, Joseph Gordon-Levitt  steals the screen, and you can be sure you will be seeing him in A LOT more movies.
0515125024|1.0|Lee Child is one of the best action-suspense novelists out there.  He is a writer of immense talent.  He normally writes in a very terse, no-nonsense style that really motivates the reader to turn the pages.  His hero Jack Reacher has become an inconic character, kind of an American James Bond.<br /><br />DIE TRYING, however, is one of Child's lesser efforts.  The plot of this book is, quite simply, ludicrous.  All of Child's stories are admittedly implausable, but this one really strains credibility.  Much of what happens in this novel is statistically impossible, and I found myself rolling my eyes at much of it.  I've seen dumb action movies with better constructed plots than DIE TRYING.<br /><br />Characterization is also quite weak here.  There are too many characters and Child keeps on shifting the reader's perspective from one secondary character to another.  All the villains in DIE TRYING are silly right-wing militia types.  Many of them are too buffoonish to be truly threatening.  Many of the action scenes lack emotional punch because you don't really care about any of the players.<br /><br />Child also has an unfortunate tendency to describe every scene in minute detail, so that a straightforward action scene is drawn out to an interminable length.  In this book, this writing style really bogs down the narrative and made it difficult for me to finish this novel.  I skimmed this novel toward the end, which is too bad, because Child is a very smart writer overall.<br /><br />My advice is to skip this poorly structured effort and devote your time to Child's better books like KILLING FLOOR and ECHO BURNING.
B000H305U0|3.0|Well it started out okay wih some good beats and cool sounds, but..... what in the world is going on at the end of the album I swear it went a little bit country.
0792839749|5.0|Dick Van Dyke brigns to life Caracticous Pott, an inventer whose inventions never seem to work out the way he wants. One thing I didn't realize for the longest time was the play on words in the creation of name. Take Caracticous Pott. He's a 'Crack-Pot' inventor.<br /><br />The songs are great. I can listen to Hushabye Mountain and Ol Bamboo a hundred times. But let's not forget the title song \\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\". A catchy tune that the kids will bug you with for weeks. After I got this DVD and the kids had watched it for awhile, everytime we got in the car they would sing it. Cute at first but wore on the ears after the first dozen times.<br /><br />The stroyline is sound, basically a fairytale told at the beach. If you are ever to watch this, you need to watch the dvd or vhs. Don't waste your time with regular tv, they cut way too much out.<br /><br />Excellent all way around. Dick Van Dyke is one of my favorite actors of all time who rarely lets you down.
0618680004|3.0|Most scientists go through life not worrying about this stuff. They shrug and get on with careers without giving the idea of God much thought. Dawkins, on the other hand, is a true God Botherer. Has there been a day in his professional life in which he has not felt compelled to loudly declare the Absence Of God? He feels just as challenged by the huge numbers of agnostic shruggers as any evangelical zealot driven by the Spirit. In other words, Dawkins is an intensely religious person - an extreme Protestant if you like. An Ultra. This book is his latest attempt to grab the coat lapels of the non-committed and shake some sense into them. Good luck to Dawkins. One commends his industry and his zeal. <br />
B000002KLG|5.0|Quincy thanks specially for Lee Ritenour in inner sleeve. <br />I think his works in this album is great as both a guitar player and a additional arranger, too. <br />He plays incredibly cool backing in \\"Midnight Love Affiar\\" and \\"Give me The Night\\". <br />And he plays the acorstic guitar lyrically in \\"Love Dance\\". <br />I think \\"give Me The Night\\" is Lee\\"s best studio work.
0425156842|5.0|\\"He who cannot draw on 3000 years is living from hand to mouth\\" - Goethe. <br /> <br />To draw on the past 3000 years read Sophie's World. An alternative title for the book could be \\"Evolution of Western Philosophy for Dummies\\".  <br /> <br />Great book!
B00005JKGO|5.0|After a half-century on this earth, life has been a wonderfully delicious mixture of sweet and sour, goodness and disgrace, dashed hopes and eternal optimism. And \\"La Dolce Vita\\" always ends up as my top pick among the world's great cinema because only Fellini can express this yin-yang of human existence.<br /><br />Fellini's masterpiece begins with Christ both literally and figuratively being brought down to the level of Man. After three spellbinding hours, it ends with the central character glancing nonchalantly at a large, dead fish - the traditional symbol of Christianity and the \\"all-seeing\\" eye of the Father watching over Mankind. In between, Maestro Fellini shows us how one human being can inexorably fritter his life away, hoping against hope to overcome a distant relationship with his father, his reluctance to establish a true, loving bond with a woman, and find meaning in his chosen career. In all three attempts, he comes up short, wandering in circles and making a final descent to the sea at morning, an obvious but very appropriate metaphor for the water of Baptism (which failed at the Fountain of Trevi) and a new beginning. When Mastroianni's character glances at the innocent face of the child he had met before taking his final plunge into nothingness, he can't quite comprehend the message, and turns away - a dramatic contrast to the final scene at the shore in \\"La Strada\\" where Zampano's mind and heart come apart upon his understanding of how he has cast aside real love and genuine human connectedness.<br /><br />Fellini's genius is in rendering this rich morality play in a constantly engaging set of bittersweet vignettes, shot in exquisite black-and-white and incredibly scored by Nino Rota, that touch all our senses without letup. Nearly 50 years after its release, this often misunderstood masterpiece never ceases to mesmerize on big screen or small. Eliminate all potential distractions when you prepare to view it, because you are soon to be in the presence of Greatness.s.
B000G7PMD2|5.0|All I have to say is how thankful I am that I discovered Dream Theater.  I didn't discover them until about a year ago, but it has made all the difference in the world.  The Octavarium and Score tour displays selections from all of their 8 studio albums and also some tracks that didn't make it to cd.  I went and saw them in Philadelphia in March and i was blown away.  Being the first time seeing them live, I was literally couldn't stop smiling because of how amazing they actually were.  Score has some classic Dream Theater songs but also ones you've never heard before but you will be so thankful that you did.  My favorite track on the album right now is Raise the Knife.  Seriously, if you do not have this album yet, or you aren't a big fan of Dream Theater, buy this immediately.  You won't be disappointed.  Musical perfection is its greatest form, even after 20 years.  Amazing
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Isn't it ironic that Phil Spector is in prison for murder?!  Makes you wonder what he murdered.  His wife or the Let it Be album!  I absolutely adore that this release came out.  No matter how you look at it, this is the way this album was meant to be heard.  All tracks sound phoemoninal!!  Get Back should have had the fade out though (as it appears on the single), but other than that, every track (especially I've got a Feeling and One after 909) sound perfect.  Kudos also go to Across the Universe mix for giving John's vocals more intensity.  Spector should stay in jail (even if he's acquitted) for his WALL OF SOUND on The Long and Winding Road and Across the Universe.  His work upset the group and George Martin and should not go unpunished!  I never even knew that the multi-talented Billy Preston had a solo on Winding Road until I heard this.  Like on the other rocking tracks, it is breath-taking!! <br />
B00004T9UF|5.0|I certainly think that this is a rap album that was worthy of the 5 stars I gave it. Its excellent. Eminem was really able to bring something to the table back in 2000 and has a great style. His certainly not gangsta rap seeing his not black and he didn't grow up in the ghetto and drug deal etc. So its rather different to alot of other rap albums, but if you are a rap fan than you'll probably enjoy this. He is not bling bling obsessed or anything, the topics in his songs are very interesting and his lyrical skills make prove him as one of the best lyricists ever. I think its such a shame that Em made such rubbish albums (Encore) later in his career when he proved how skilled he was with albums like this. Now about the songs. There are many great songs on this album and all the guest appearances are top. The 3 singles were Stan, The Way I Am and The Real Slim Shady, and none of them were at all overrated. Stan is a very interesting story about a diehard fan committing suicide because he doesn't answer his fan mail. The Way I Am is an angry song where Eminem basically tells people to say away from him. Then The Real Slim Shady is one of those humourous songs he has similiar to My Name Is. Then there are really violent songs like Kill You and Kim, drug songs like Drug Ballad and Under The Influence, a part two of Snoop Dogg's B Please and some more funny songs like Amityville and Criminal. Well this album certainly deserved its Parental Advisory sticker. However you should forget about that and listen to Eminem tell stories of his crazy world.
B000E0WJIC|4.0|Bullet for my Valentine basically take emo/hardcore elements, and serve them up with a healthy dose of thrash and melodic death metal, to create a sound that is definitely a cut above the rest.  Sure, frontman Matt Tuck can get a little emo-ish at times, but he's also a good screamer, and the band is always quick with a blazing riff, a scorching solo, an Iron Maiden-ish melody, or a blistering double bass attack.  I'd say this album is really more metal than anything, so if you've always wanted a bit more metal in this type of music, then you're likely to find plenty of enjoyment here.  These guys are great musicians, who really know how to rock hard.  Best song is \\"The End\\", a 7-minute epic that alternates between dark, haunting melodies, and powerful climactic riffs.  The rest are in the 3-4 minute range, and a bit more straight-forward, but still full of interesting dynamics.  It never gets boring for a second.<br /><br />Overall, this album really took me by surprise.  Not quite amazing, but when you consider how awful a lot of these kinds of bands are, these guys are really something special.  Recommended to fans of Thrice and Alexisonfire, as well as fans of Shadows Fall and In Flames, or just to anyone who enjoys well-played heavy music with plentiful melody.
1591840562|5.0|It's very apparent from all the other reviews that this is an excellent book, both in style and substance. I have to agree. <br /> <br />I will just add that if you are serious about starting up your own company, read this book twice. The first time, read it from cover to cover. The second time read it with a highlighter and taking copious notes. <br /> <br />The one thing that guy neglects to include in this post-boom tome is: where can potential entrepreneurs meet investors and venture capitalists? Everyone says don't send in business plans blind, they will not be reviewed seriously. \\"Get an introduction to the investor before you pitch.\\" I have to believe investors do not attend regular networking/business events shopping for ideas. They would be mobbed like Clay Aiken at a middle school pep rally. Perhaps they attend undercover, but I have doubts about this too. So, Guy, if you're reading this, maybe you could tell us budding entrepreneurs how to get an audience with a busy investor like you.
B000002OX3|3.0|The absence of Happy Jack is I think due to the reissue being based on the UK version of the album. I love the Nicky Hopkins harpsicord on I Need You. The version of Heatwave kicks but I only give it 3 stars cos it's caught in the middle of the Who having an identity crisis they didn't really resolve until Leeds (even if I love the Who Sell Out - but that's really down to the songwriting).
B000001FTD|5.0|Classic album (I do have the cd and the album, but nothing like popcorn with some good music)Bello's bassing is amazing and his energy level is off the CHAIN! Charlie's drumming is like no other! Scott is a mad man moshing all over the stage (when this record came out). Spitz soloing is-well, PERFECT, PERIOD! And Joey. What can be said about Joey that has not been already been said? I'm glad he's back with the (2nd) original line-up. I still listen to this cd regularly. John Bush was great also but this is Bellodanno's band. I've seen them when Danny Lilker was playing with them at L'AMORE'S IN Brooklyn (BROOKLYN, STAND UP). One of the BEST thrash bands, EVER! Metallica (with Cliff!), Slayer, Megadeth and Anthrax. Those are the fore-fathers of thrash! Get at me if you think NOT.--- NOT.--- NOT.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|I have been an Iron Maiden fan since Killers. I was about 8. Over the years, however, I have felt that Maiden went from being the true innovator to a copy of themselves. When Bruce left, It seemed all but over. Then Both Brice and Adrian rejoined. I was thrilled, but to be honest, I felt they only reached back to the imitation of themselves mode. Sure all of their albums have had great moments, but (in my opinion) The whole was not a great as the parts.<br /><br />Now comes a matter of life and death. It is their best recording since Powerslave. The band is no longer stuck in the rut of their genre. Rather, they play softer passages as well as skull splitting heavy metal. The prog influence, that has long been dormant, has made it's way back into the mix. The band recorded this album in a few months, most of it was recorded with all members in the same rom. It was a gamble that paid off big time. The excitement of their live show (maidens BEST platform) shines through better than on any album since Killers. Everyone is in top form.<br /><br />Congrats Maiden, you just released your best album in 2 decades.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|I saw this concert on my local PBS station, taped in Las Vegas. I had heard of Yanni for years but had never heard him...I am so very sorry I have lost so many years of enjoyment. The concert was amazing. The musicians he chose to play with him absolutely first rate. The music was old and new at the same time. The rhythms were intoxicating. I am now a faithful fan and am going to buy up all of Yanni's music as my budget allows, this DVD will be the first!
B000E6ESL2|4.0|This movie fits nicely into what I call the mind-bender genre, which, aptly enough, is how it is described in the first sentence of the product description.  It sits on my shelf next to films such as Memento, Donnie Darko, and Mulhullond Drive (and pretty much any other David Lynch movie).  It's difficult to figure out what is going on, where the film is heading, and has a twist of an ending that kind of clarifies things.  However, you will probably have to watch it again to fully understand it and/or put all of the clues together.  I personally love these types of films; understandably, a lot of people don't, and those people likely will not enjoy this movie.      The general concept of the film is similar to Jacob's Ladder, as noted in many earlier reviews.  A good movie, but not quite as good as the first three I mentioned (I give it the nod over Jacob's Ladder though).
0307346609|5.0|The Zombie Survival Guide: a straight-faced book about a whimsical subject.  Then Max Brooks decided to take the world that George Romero put on film, and write about it in the way that Studs Terkel took on the Working world.  The result is a truly surprising novel that subtly grabs you, then before you know it has you in a vice grip, and won't let you go.  Brooks tells little stories of the global pandemic that come together to paint a plauseable oral history of political arrogance, social collapse, individual frustration, horror and bravery.  After several of the \\"interviews\\" I found myself pausing, letting the characters' words and emotions sink in.  Sounds silly, and noone was more surprised than I.  If you are a fan on the films of Romero, or find yourself wondering exactly what went on in the 28 Days before Jim woke up from his coma, read this book.  You won't be disapointed.
B0000VD04M|5.0|Tim Burton's \\"Ed Wood\\" never hit it big at the box office but has now become a cult favorite, much like its eponymous subject.  Johnny Depp brings in a performance of unbridled, blind enthusiasm that has you rooting for Ed to make good.  Martin Landau deservedly won an Oscar for his fantastic performance of drug-addicted, decrepit Bela Lugosi.  Bill Murray as the flamboyant \\"Bunny\\" steals every scene he's in.  The rest of the cast turn in solid performances, with the exception of the typical wooden performance by Sarah Jessica Parker.  The \\"Special Edition\\" offers some bonus extras, the most interesting being \\"The Making Of Bela\\", which goes into detail about the makeup used to transform Martin Landau into Bela.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is one of my absolute favorite movies for so many reasons.  While some of the story lines are simple, others will stay with you even after the movie ends.  If for no other reason, watch this to see the scene of Emma Thompson in her bedroom.  It's absolutely devastating.  There is no other word.  I've never seen such better song placement in a movie than  Joni Mitchell's, \\"Both Sides Now\\" .  The extra footage of the director talking on the DVD is also very interesting.  This is also one of my fave soundtracks.
B000H7JD4A|5.0|The greatness of this album is not really the songs, although all of them are no doubt high-quality rockers. It's rather the fact that this is serious metal again with no filler, an album you can listen to from beginning to end and fully enjoy it. Although I do believe that Bruce's voice has deteriorated with age, plus there's been a departure from his operatic singing style, on the positive side it's still great to hear a screaming Bruce Dickinson with his voice full of passion, accompanied by heavy riffing, great solos, and a return to using harmonies in songs. There are signs to me that this album is a work of brilliance because of the fact that this album feels almost like a full-blown concept album, simply because often the same melody recurrs in differnt songs under differnt disguises, which is evidence of the fact that the band knew exactly what they were doing this time and were all on the same page. The heavy, dark riffs and an uncompromised devotion to emotion give the whole thing that special magic, the feeling that you had when you first listened to Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. Although Bruce's singing is not as operatic as on the classic albums, Kevin Shirley was finally smart enough to put much more echo on the vocals than was the case in the last two releases, so the whole doesn't sound dry and flat and gives it that certain \\"je ne sais quoi.\\" It's a joy to listen to this output and it doesn't really bother me this time that some of the songs got quite lengthy. Somehow it just all makes sense. Just like the rest of the band, Adrian Smith, too, and maybe the most, seems to have found himself again on this record by going back to the modern Jackson guitars he used on Somewhere in Time and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son and getting heavily involved in the songwriting process again. This is certainly another shining moment of his talent and shows what he means to the band and what the Murray/Gers duo was missing in all those wasted years. If the guys can keep the momentum going, I am 100% positive that the next record will be an absolute and undisputed masterpiece. Not to say that this one isn't. Just listen to it. Then open the booklet and look at the pictures of the band members and how calm and confident they look this time, how they, just like good wine, have ripened, come full circle and found themselves again at a stage in their carreer when everybody believed it was all over and time for them to resign with dignity.
0743201140|5.0|By Jeffrey W. Bennett, ISP, author of [[ASIN:0981620604 ISP Certification-The Industrial Security Professional Exam Manual]] and [[ASIN:1588510980 Under the Lontar Palm]]<br /><br />This book turned me upside down.  What a novel concept, to focus on what our strenghts are.  I used excerpt from this excellent book in a time management presentation for my coworkers.  How else can you perform at your peak unless you are doing something you absolutely love.  When you know your strenghts, it's easier to focus on being successful where you are.  If you are concerned about weaknesses, then you are spinning your wheels.  It's like Pareto's Principle.  You need to focus your efforts on the 20% that makes 80% of the results and this books shows you how.
0618680004|5.0|One reviewer tells us that \\"There is no debate (NONE!) between science and religion. ........The biblical writers didn't intend us to take them literally, that is obvious. They were addressing metaphysical/spiritual matters with literature. So where's the debate?\\" <br /> <br />Where? Simple! Religionists will certainly not leave the determination of facts to scientists since as we have seen, they continue to make implausible empirical assertions about everything from the age of the earth to the literal exitence of angels. They also try to force religious ideas into the educational system. On the other hand, scientists (especially atheist scientists) are not about to leave moral and spiritual questions up to religionists (at least I won't). <br /> <br />Of course, even more important is the global political factors. The zeal with which those infected with religious fire try to convert the world and prevent folks from behaving in certain ways is astounding. Violence is always a possiblity when the belief is strongly enough felt. I was raised in a religious home, but overall, I now feel frightened by religion. <br /> <br />Dawkin's never fails to engage the issues intelligently and frankly. This book is no exception. Read with an open mind and try to not worry about what the meaning of life without God might be. It does have meaning but you must not let fear of death or hell get in the way of reason. <br />
1592289444|1.0|I purchased this book in a National Park bookstore.  Given its glowing reviews I plunged in and read it in just a few days.  It's a stunning  <br />read - - well written and understated.  Several times during the process I was puzzled; eight days in the Gobi without water, thirty miles per day in rough going, etc.  However, so absorbing is the book that I suspended <br /> my better judgment in the rush to advance the story.  Only upon completion did the doubts surface.  Upon rereading certain sections, it now seems clear that the story is a hoax.  Furthermore, it is written by  <br />someone without much experience in hiking/walking in wilderness.  I also <br />wondered why the USSR would \\"waste\\" one year in trying to get one individual to confess before shipping him to Siberia.  I leave this to experts on the Soviet Union, but as one who has done just a bit of hiking in warm climates, I can say the \\"long walk\\" portion of this book is more <br />of a comic book story than a real one.  A pity.
B00005QDW5|2.0|I really like Pink Floydm but DO NOT BUY THIS CD. They trim down and butcher songs like MAROONED and ECHOES, and what's the point of Calling it \\"Echoes\\" if they cut out 7 minutes of the greatest song of all time? DO NOT BUY
B000G75AE8|4.0|This album sounds like the logical successor to Season In The Abyss recorded 16 years ago and Dave Lombardo's last album with Slayer. It's almost as though those 16 years never happened and that is both this albums strength and ironically it's weakness. The music for the most part is pure unadulterated thrash and Lombardo plays better than during his original tenure with Slayer. The man is a maniac with the double bass and its a total joy to hear the excitement he generates in this band. Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman are as incredible as ever with their lead playing and many of the riffs are wonderfully brutal. The problem is they're also in some cases generic-Slayer sounding. Not every song has this malady: Eyes Of The Insane and Black Serenade are standout tracks. But there are other songs such as the opener Flesh Storm or the Angel-Of-Death-sounding Catalyst that are a tad formulaic. Lyrically Slayer retread much of the violent subject matter explored on other albums, you know the drill. But on several songs they get somewhat political such as Jihad and Confearacy. So whats the verdict? It's for the most part blisteringly fast thrash, Lombardo's back better than ever, it sounds really good although more bottom end would be nice. Tom's voice is well mixed and less grating than it was on God Hates Us All, the riffs are brutal and the leads smoke. However lyrically the cd has some weak points, we've heard this stuff before and some of the songs are generic-Slayer sounding though they're still very good. Slayer aren't breaking any new ground with this album, but I've had this thing in my iPod since it came out and I'm still enjoying the hell out of it. It's not a classic album but a damn good one. Slayer have not let me down.
B00006HBUA|1.0|I wasn't going to watch this period, but tonight on the ABC Family Channel this was on, so I'm like o.k. let's see why I wasn't up to watching this. I got my answer rather quickly. Mind you it was a clever attempt to show that it wasn't all cartoon pie in the sky. It starts with the Mystery Machine group Velma, Fred, Shaggy, Daphnie, and Scooby all going thier separate ways as a t.v. show wanting to be cancelled. It also showed that the five all had thier personal isssues with each other, and decide it's for the best to just go thier own ways. They are all brought back together by an anonymous person to solve the mystery on Spooky Island. I found Spooky Island to be a pathetc cross between Adventureland, and Pleasure Island at Walt Disney World. This is where the clever attempt starts to unravel as you see the group trying to solve the mystery, and along the way they pick up Scrappy Doo, and depending on your sense of humor this may be funny as Daphnie gets upset with Scrappy Doo because he peed on her, but to me the line Fred uses about Scrappy marking his territory on Daphnie was without a doubt a feeble attempt to rescue this movie from absolute ruin. The special effects were also out of place here for this being a cartoon for kids up to 8-9 years old to have special effects that are more geared at an older audience was improper. I think I know as to why the group Sugar Ray ended up killing thier careers as they performed in this movie, and then the group ends up turning into monsters. It would go even further to where Fred, Velma, and Daphnie all turn into monsters as well. I couldn't go further as the movie was just that bad. I found the fact that Shaggy actually fell in love with a girl as the closest thing positive that I could find about this movie, but I feel that he should date Velma though because she's more about sense, and would be the close friend that Shaggy needs that doesn't walk on all fours. You got me I watched it, and now that I have I can say without a shadow of a doubt \\"IT SUCKS\\".ithout a shadow of a doubt \\"IT SUCKS\\".
B0000026WD|5.0|Michael Jackson's Dangerous album proves to be his best solo work ever, even better then previous works such as Bad and Thriller. The press generally ignores this album, and focuses on Jackson's early albums which is a shame. Fans all around the world need to listen to this masterpiece, with unforgetable and mind grabbing hits.  <br /> <br />With over 30 million albums sold worldwide, Dangerous is one of the top 20 best selling albums ever. (Jackson has 3 entries) This is for good reason, as every song is pure quality and is much ahead of its time. Infact, this album still sounds fresh when you pop it in the CD player today. I being a teenager, could see many of my peers enjoying this cd, as its a combination of pop, rock, soul, r&b, and \\"jack-swing\\". It truly is a diverse collection and has so many different styles of music that its almost impossible to get sick of it. <br /> <br />The best tracks are: In The Closet, Remember The Time, Black Or White, Will You Be There, Give Into Me, and Dangerous. If you havent yet purchased Michael Jackson's Dangerous album, you must add it to your collection, as a vital piece in the pop music saga that Jackson himself defined.  <br /> <br />Overall rating: 10/10
B00020HEL6|5.0|Renee is beyond amazing and I am a hugh fan! I have purchased at least 10 CD's for my family and friends and they all are fans. She has everything - an amazing voice, an amazing presence and amazing talent. The only thing that would be better is if Renee did a duet with Michael Buble - the two of them would be better than Sinatra and...well better than everybody! Renee and Michael are the best talents to come along in moons!!!!!
B00005JP7Y|4.0|In Step Up, Channing Tatum plays Tyler Gage, a kid from the wrong side of the streets who is sentenced to community service after vandalizing the theater of a private performing arts school.  His community service forces him to go to the school every day and work as a janitor until he completes his sentence.  Along the way, he stumbles upon the school's dance team and is particularly fascinated by a girl named Nora (Jenna Dewan).<br /><br />When Nora's dance partner for her senior showcase gets injured and is unable to perform, Tyler steps in as her partner. His hip hop dance style clashes at first with her classical ballet training, but eventually they learn to combine their styles to come up with a performance piece.<br /><br />This movie has all the elements of great teen dance dramas including Save The Last Dance (the hip hop dancer and the ballerina), Dirty Dancing 2 (the rich girl and street boy dance together in a showcase), and Center Stage (the backstabbing that goes on in a performing arts school).  If you liked any of those movies, I think you'll enjoy this one. And if nothing else, go see it for Channing Tatum. His combination of looks and dancing ability are enough to make this film worth watching.
B00006F7S4|2.0|I was expecting something brilliant because of all the hype surrounded by this one album. Beck is a good band, I wouldn't say that they're immensely talented, but they have some great songs. Frankly, I found this album boring. That's not to say that the lyrics and the music aren't beautiful, but at times all the songs come off as sounding exactly the same. The fact that they all have the same theme-sadness- doesn't really help either. As somebody has said, there are more ways to express sadness than one. Beck just keeps using the same lazy, depressed, bummed out sound throughout each song. It almost puts me to sleep with each listen. I think Beck has better songs and albums out there.
B0002J4X1Q|2.0|I did watch Resident Evil: Apocalypse back when it was in theaters & I rather enjoyed it! this movie, I just got to today & found myself wondering what the hell happened. the movie is just so much stupider then the second one. I found myself laughing at parts where we're \\"supposed to be scared\\". the acting is just not that good, it's corny as hell. hasn't anyone in this film ever heard of a zombie before? if a zombie was coming at you, would you lower your weapon or blast it apart? like, what are they doing? I got so mad at this film cause it's so stupid. why do the characters have to be so dumb? I'll blame the writers, the director's for this. Resident Evil is not worth your time or money. I found the second one more enjoyable for some reason. so please, look elsewhere. I'd be more entertained by a fish swimming in circles.
0688170528|2.0|I read \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" by the same author recently. While implausible in some places, it was a page turner, at least until the absurd ending with characters that you genuinely cared about. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this is not the same. Until I read it, I would not have believed that a novel about two young kindred spirits who make a suicide pact, and how the survivor deals with a murder accusation could be so dull. But it is. <br /> <br />While I felt sorry for the protagonists, I never felt engaged with their plight. Perhaps this is due to the author, perhaps it was me. I have no idea. <br />
B000FS9FCG|4.0|What makes V for Vendetta so interesting is that it is a different film then you'd expect it to be! V(Hugo Weaving) rescues Evey at the start of the movie from a few punks & at that point, I was confused cause I wasn't sure if he was a bad guy or a good guy having knowing nothing about the movie before I watched it other then the fact that Natalie Portman was in it of course. then he rescues her after killing many cops in which was basically blood bath after she watches him blow up a building & the movie has taken a dramatic turn. She's now his prisoner & he plans to continue his attacks of revenge against the government. V is an extremely experienced killer while no one knows his real name & we never see his face. but all his points against the government are valid & though I don't agree with him killing everyone as the solution, its his motivation that make this movie so different & so much fun! Of Evey(Natalie) escapes from the killer & they don't exactly become enemies as he keeps trying to get her to be like him & since they are still friends, sorta anyway, something happens with the both of them & they fall in love! & the final question is, will this effect Evey's decision at the end of the movie? Guess you'll have to wait to see what I'm talking about. It's a truly entertaining piece of work! recommend this to anyone who's looking for something with alot of action & makes some sense! Good film to catch!
B0000648WZ|1.0|One star is too high! <br />\\"Constant reader/viewer 'frowed' up\\" <br /> Read the book! <br /> This movie is a pitiful attempt by Hollywood liberals to smear a great man, a great writer and one of his greatest works.   <br />It is passing strange that some people can praise this travesty of an adaption of Robert Anson Heinlein's Starship Troopers.   <br />  They must not have read the book.   <br />Actually, that's true. <br />In an interview with STARLOG magazine, Verhoeven the director admitted he stopped reading it after the first 6 chapters!  They bought the rights to the book after a staffer recognised the similarity with their current project, so the Verhoeven got SONY to buy the rights, (I understand the SONY board members were VERY disapointed with this turkey) then they rewrote the pre-existing screenplay to conform with names etc. <br />  I think the people who are in favor of this movie are trying to unload a copy of this piece of manure. <br />  A lawyer would love to attack such a case of misrepresentation and \\"bait &  switch tactics\\", etc. <br />  The movie was lousy, pitifully written, poorly acted, and THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE PATHETIC: movies that came out the same month, such as Lost in Space and others such as Spawn, which came out before ST, had much better CGI in every catagory, especially the armored, powered suits that were so central to the Mobile Infantry of the book, but whose utter lack on the screen were dismissed by the director Verhoeven et al \\"as being beyond our current technical capabilities\\"!  HAH!  Check out other movies from November '97 and see it's just another lie by Vorhoeven and the other promoters of this piece of slime. <br />  Considering how little it has in common with the book it purports to adapt to the screen, aside from the names of some of the characters, and a few scenes from the book, but not the plot or theme by any means, the reason they didn't retitle it something else was because it would have made  far less money, albeit more honestly. <br />  When confronted by the vast discrepancies between the book and film, and the huge 'liberties' they took with it, and the lies they told promoting it, by the millions of fans of the book, the screenwriter and director resorted to pitiful excuses; eventually coming back to \\"Sony paid for the rights, it doesn't matter what was in the book, we did what we wanted, etc\\"  The best response to such childishness, is the movie's failure at the box office. <br />  Actually, this film has more in common with a PR film Verhoeven did back in the early 60's for the dutch marines, than it does with Heinlein's book. <br />  Unlike the book, the humans in the movie are generally so stupid, you start hoping the bugs win because they are the only sign of intelligent life onscreen. <br />  Politically, Robert A Heinlein was a probably a rational libertarian when he wrote this (1958), having matured from his 'new deal democrat' roots in the '30's. <br />  He was opposed to the draft all his life, believing it unnecessary in a society worth defending, and a true anti-fascist. <br /> The deliberate misrepresentation of his book, and his mature political views, as fascist on the screen is a travesty of justice.  The book has been condemned by people who haven't read it for almost 50 years yet the book unlike this DVD is still in print, almost 20 years after RAH died. <br />  Sooner or later someone will do a remake of this anti Heinlien diatribe, and if that's half as accurate or true to the book as the Tolkien LoR or Rowling's HP series then that might be worth watching.

0765315246|5.0|As almost everyone before me who did a review on this book I have to give it 5 stars also. Easy quick read and seemed almost believable. It is based on an interesting concept. I am definitely reading the sequel, Ghost Brigades.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|I really can't believe some of the complaints on here.  People, (such as myself) p and m'd about the changes made to a cherished movie.  FINALLY, I have a chance to see the original 29 yr old movie as I first saw it.  In 1977, there was no \\"anamorphic widescreen\\" THX, DTS, HD, etc.  There was Panavision, and Dolby stereo.  It seems like people want Lucas to cater to their individual needs.  \\"I want the original version, but with the following improvements/enhancements...\\"  To me, that defeats the purpose.  The only way this could have been better would be to include the \\"Star Wars Holiday Special\\"  Btw, I am a nerd through and through.  Just be glad I've never posted a review of Jackson's hack-job to Tolkien.  Happy Life Day, everyone!
B0001GF2DS|5.0|Finally \\"The Good,The Bad and The Ugly\\" finally gets the red carpet treatment it deserves from the guys at MGM Home Entertainment!!! This superlative 2-DVD set includes the extended version of the film in both English and Italian!!! Wow!!! It sports BOTH great picture and sound!!! It also contains a wealth of extras to enjoy!!! This great DVD set will keep you amuzed for hours!!! And to cap it off,it comes in a nice collector's case!!! A very well rounded package of a very superior western starring Clint Eastwood,Lee Van Cleef,and Eli Wallach!!! Sure, it costs \\"a few dollars more\\" than the standard single disc version but it's well worth the money!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+
0393316041|5.0|A really great book by a great man.  I almost laughed out loud while on a train and am sure people thought I was crazy. The book made me wonder how can you lead such an interesting life and yet win a Nobel Prize in physics (I guess you can).  <br />Though the book does not follow a chronological order , I could feel the earlier part corresponds to the youthful times in his life (If he ever got old). Towards the later stages in the book I could also sense some cynicism in his words and he feels strongly about the lack of integrity, particularly in scientific research and life in general around him.  <br />A wonderful book that gives some insight into a brilliant mind and inspires to think while learning and not just memorize facts. <br />
0790731509|5.0|Okay,the only real extras on the DVD is a theatrical trailer for the film and some biographical information on the movie and it's stars,but Warner Bros. gets a five star rating for great picture and sound and the option of BOTH Standard Full Frame and Widescreen versions on one disc!!! This movie is an absolute classic!!! And it's great to have it on DVD!!! One of the great \\"men in chains\\" films!!! The great cast includes Paul Newman,George Kennedy(in his oscar winning role!),Wayne Rogers,Strother Martin,Joe Don Baker,Ralph Waite,and many other classic character actors!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+
B000GFLAI0|5.0|The voice is well used, indicative of someone who has been around a long time and lived a lot.  The songs on this CD are leisurely, the shortest being 4 minutes 55 seconds long.  The instrumentation is simple and spare--perfect for the voice and the lyrics.  This is not one of those overdone studio albums, filled with all sorts of effects that can overwhelm the lyrics or the songs' delivery.<br /><br />This is a bluesy album, as some have noted.  It is the product of a long career.  One can pick up faint echoes of earlier songs (Is it just me or is it accurate to say that \\"Spirit on the Water\\" is an interesting synthesis of \\"Lay Lady Lay\\" and \\"Tangled up in Blue\\"?) as well as twists and turns from the history of rock and roll (again, is it just me or is the guitar work on \\"Thunder on the Mountain\\" reminiscent of Chuck Berry's music in Berry's prime?).  However, there is nothing derivative about this album.  Dylan's talent has matured over time, and his recent set of CDs shows him to still have his creative juices intact.<br /><br />\\"The Levee's Gonna Break\\" has interesting lyrics and a bluesy sensibility that make this an attractive song.<br /><br />Recently, it appears that Bob Dylan has shown some signs of life after what seem to me to be a series of okay but not very special works.  For those who like Dylan to begin with, this is well worth the purchase.  There is still life left in this troubador's work.
B000089CJI|5.0|I didn't quite understand the importance of \\"Give Up\\" three years ago. I was 18, fresh out of high school, and Such Great Heights was on some commercial for a car or something. <br />I'm 21 now, and I may not fully understand all of what Ben Gibbard and Jimmy Tamborello felt with all of this, but I understand my acceptance of this record and all that it gave to me. This album is a full-on assault of emotion and hope. <br />\\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\\" is one of the most amazing songs I have heard in my life. The backing vocals are beautiful and pure, as is the feeling the song projects. <br />\\"Nothing Better\\" is an amazing duet a la Humanleague that grabs you from the second it starts. The line \\"dont you feed me lies about some idealistic future\\" is one of the greatest phrases I have come across in a sea of lyrics that I have absorbed in my lifetime. <br />\\"Clark Gable\\" is an up track with a dancy beat and nancy lyrics that any Smiths or DuranDuran fan would absolutely cream over. The melody is beautiful and soaring and gives the listener a feeling of flight. <br />\\"Give Up\\" is an amazing album from start to finish and should be absorbed by anyone willing to open their hearts and minds and, for once, feel the emotion of true artists that will, in turn, help them learn about themselves. <br />

0393312836|4.0|Picture Nighthawks, the painting by Edward Hopper.  Dim the lights.  Cobble and dirty the streets.  Roughen the clientele, and ascribe raucous thuggery.  Such is the ambience of A Clockwork Orange.  Exit into the crisp night air with caution; this is not a place for the faint of heart. This is the rough and desolate world of post-modern existentialism.   <br /> <br />His name is Alex, and he leads a gang of thugs.  Dressed in the height of fashion, their minds are filled with drugged drink, solipsism, and \\"ultra-violence\\".  Sometimes they are the Nighthawks; sometimes they are those they prey upon them.  They are, at minimum, a terror that menaces this hollow society.   <br /> <br />Anthony Burgess brings together the graphic violence of Quentin Tarantino, the inky ambience of Joseph Conrad, and (bear with me here), the understated and even farcical humor of Damon Runyon.  Unlike Tarantino, however, Burgess has thinly veiled the disturbingly violent escapades of Alex and his cohorts under a narrative written in a fictional slang.  The slang itself is part of what creates an otherworldly ambience, seasons the text with whimsical humor, and brings the reader into an unsettling relationship with the graphic imposition of suffering which Alex and his gang have embraced as their daily bread-and-butter: <br /> <br />~~So that was old Dim's cue and he went grinning and going er er and a a a for this veck's dithering rot, crack crack, first left fistie then right, so that our dear old droog the red - red vino on tap and the same in all places, like it's put out by the same big firm - started to pour and spot the nice clean carpet and the bits of his book that I was still ripping away at, razrez razrez.~~ <br /> <br />\\"What's it going to be then, eh?\\" is a question which, by my count, appears three times in the text.  The question implies that Alex is indeed capable of choice, of becoming more than a victim himself of a habitual cycle of violence.  Once at the beginning of the book, once in prison, and once at the end of the book among a new troop of gang member, the question surfaces, as if inviting Alex to value something more than the temporal.  It is not until the element of choice is taken from Alex that he begins to change, at first assuming a passing interest in God while in prison, and then after being subjected to a government-imposed scheme to rid prisoners of violence through chemically- and visually-induced brainwashing. <br /> <br />Although I struggle with valuing any book so intently focused on violence, I find A Clockwork Orange a quirky piece of brilliance.  The humor is subtle but well-placed in revealing Alex's adolescent qualities.  Once incarcerated, he wisecracks about being \\"dressed in the height of prison fashion\\" and extols the value of reading the Bible, but mainly the part where the Jews beat each other up, drink plenty of wine, and sleep with each other's wives . . .   <br /> <br />Yet despite his penchant for violence, it is hard to not humanize Alex.  His smirking, if not comedic outlook on life is somewhat contagious, and he is not immune to the full range of human emotion.  Once faced with the prospect of a government reform program which would eliminate his power of choice forever, he seems to encounter real fear, a nascent conceptualization of sin, and the prospect, according to the prison chaplain of being \\"beyond the reach of the power of prayer\\".  Having come through the program and endured various measures of victimization and reform afterwards, however, he still carries a comforting resemblance to his original, whimsical self.  Recovering in a hospital, he asks about his condition in his typical, humorous fashion, \\"But has anyone been doing anything with my gulliver?  What I mean is, have they been playing around with inside like my brain?\\"   <br /> <br />It is unlikely that many readers would naturally identify with Alex.  But this is perhaps part of Burgess' brilliance.  Despite Alex's immersionin the dregs of life (drugs, crime, violence, gangs, etc.), we begin to value his humanity as manifested in the freedom to make moral choices.  Once stripped of this, we begin to see Alex as stripped of an inalienable right, as stripped of his own humanity.  Perhaps then, the enduring value of A Clockwork Orange is its affirmation of moral choice as an inextricable component of humanity in us all.  To be deprived of choice is to be deprived of being human, even if we remain physically alive.
B00005NNT1|4.0|I am often sickened by Disney's overpriced cheesy books, toys and other merchandise that are far from \\"classic\\" as well as their idiotic marketing ploy for their videos - the Disney vault. Yet when I watch a wonderful classic film like this all is forgiven. One caution the movie could be frightening to very young or fearful children. The Queen and her mirror are really scary as are her various plots to kill Snow White. I don't think the typical kid over seven would be afraid of it especially since there is so much comic relief from the dwarfs and the cuddly animals though the film is somewhat of a curious mix. I do find Snow White's singing and speaking voice annoying as well as her role of little homemaker but you have to remember she is a product of the late 1930's and appreciate the film as a hallmark of that time.
0552149519|4.0|(Written November 9, 2004): While I was ensconced in Iraq during most of 2003-2004, it seems the DaVinci Code created quite a stir in the civilized world.  Having just returned to the United States, I do not yet know what the stir is.  I just know that things have been stirred.<br /><br />Controversy aside, this is simply an engrossing read.  Just as we may not agree with the lyrics or message of a musician or artist, it is sometimes difficult to argue that the melody or creation itself is not enjoyable.  It was in this way that I found myself delighted by the DaVinci Code.  While the premises on which the book is founded (e.g. the contents of certain documents, the actual meaning of ancient symbols, the motivations behind Biblical canonization, etc.) remain far from substantiated fact, this does not justifiably impugn what is an incredibly captivating story, even if based on conjecture.  Those who want facts should read history.  This is entertainment and highly entertaining.<br /><br />When Jacques Sauni&egrave;re, curator of the iconic Louvre museum, is mysteriously murdered, his granddaughter Sophie Neveau (who almost too conveniently happens to by a cryptologist with the Paris police) and Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon are led by a series of clues to seek the legendary Holy Grail.  What the Grail actually is remains a mystery, but it seems that Sauni&egrave;re (the originator of the clues) knows both what and where.  The quest forms the substance of the story and takes place amidst a power struggle involving the Catholic Church, a secret society, and a mysterious religious fraternity.<br /><br />This novel would appear to be a hit with cerebral liberal arts types, assuming that such types would allow themselves to be so obviously courted.  Ivory Tower academia hobnobs with the Grands Maîtres D'Art, while dabbling in foreign travel, etymological enigma, conspiracy theory, religious symbolism, and understated romance to create an ambience which would likely provide a welcome escape for the millions confined to the intellectual and aesthetic doldrums of modern suburbia.  No wonder it's popular.  The story itself, while rather unlikely, retains enough elements of plausibility to cast infuse daily living with an air of mystique.  Understandably intoxicating but not necessarily accurate.  Enjoy the read, but check your facts carefully.ide a welcome escape for the millions confined to the intellectual and aesthetic doldrums of modern suburbia.  No wonder it's popular.

B0000648WZ|1.0|... as he rotates in his grave. <br /> <br />I write the following review as: a former professional photographer; an occasional technical writer and as a long-time reader of science fiction. <br /> <br />Buy RAH's book. Read it. Enjoy a book written by a master of the craft. <br /> <br />Don't bother with Verhoeven's \\"cinematic\\" version, it bears no resemblance to what RAH wrote other than the title. <br /> <br />Verhoeven's special effects don't qualify as cheesy, as one reviewer stated. They are mediocre at best. Lucas did better years ago with less money and equipment. <br /> <br />Despite Heinlein's useable (to a film maker) descriptions of weapons and tactics, Verhoeven demonstrates his lack of imagination by using current weapons technology, poorly concealed. Verhoeven's grasp of tactics is that of a man grasping water with his hands. To say it is Neanderthal is to slander the Neanderthal. <br /> <br />Robert Heinlein's widow, Virginia, was so appalled by this travesty of RAH's book she directed that his name be removed from it. <br /> <br />That in and of itself is an indicator of the quality of the film. <br /> <br />Buy the book, it's five-star material. The film rates in negative terms. <br /> <br />And, in response to Mr. Williamson's comment: Ms. Richards' cleavage is the sole redeeming virtue of Verhoeven's \\"adaptation\\" of RAH's book.

B000FQJAIW|5.0|I was really looking forward to this limited edition DVD package, having both the original version of the film & the 2004 version on DVD. <br /> <br />Had not watched the original version since the special editions came out in early 1997. <br /> <br />I was really looking forward to the commentary package with the 2004 version.  But, George, this should have been better.  Only 4 people were available?  George, Carrie, Ben Burtt & Dennis Muren?  That was it?  Harrison I know he most likely would not be interested, but where is Mark?  Was he too busy?  Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, anyone else?  No John Williams? <br /> <br />Then, the 4 people were NOT together so comments were done by themselves just talking, no reactions or stories of filming shared between the people who actually were used here. <br /> <br />And, oh George, you should be ashamed.  A promise of \\"DVD-Rom weblink to exclusive Star Wars content\\".  Oh really?  Let's see, you need to download something to view this & THEN THE DOWNLOAD DOES NOT WORK.  I am SO DISAPPOINTED in this.  I think George hang your head in shame.  For a person who has done so much with the companies you have started to help out with film effects, etc, this HAVING TO HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL INSTALLED ON YOUR COMPUTER TO WATCH THIS WHEN THE DVD PACKAGE SAYS NOTHING OF THIS SPECIAL FEATURE/DOWNLOAD BEING NEEDED.  Horrible, horrible, DOES NOT work. <br /> <br />But, keep in mind he has released the first 3 films 3 times on DVD in 2 years.  There will MORE editions in future years so we will all have to wait to see what he will add to the next DVD package.  <br /> <br />I have most of the old editions of the first 3 films on VHS & laser disc.  So, what's on the next edition George?  <br />
B000006UD8|5.0|Band Personnell: <br />Ian Gillan - Vocals <br />Ritchie Blackmore - Guitars <br />Roger Glover - Bass <br />Ian Paice - Drums <br />Jon Lord - Organs and Keyboards <br /> <br />This is a really killer album, much great things can be said about this one, and songs such as \\"Highway Star\\", \\"Never Before\\", \\"Smoke on the Water\\" and \\"Space Truckin'\\" are surely the best tracks on this album...and maybe the best songs Deep Purple ever have made, this is a great album, and the dual-disc remastered and remixed version is surely gold worth, BUY THIS ALBUM!
B0007ZEO4G|5.0|Band Personnell: <br />David Coverdale - Vocals <br />Ritchie Blackmore - Guitars <br />Glenn Hughes - Bass and Vocals <br />Ian Paice - Drums <br />Jon Lord - Keyboards <br /> <br />First album to feature David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes, it resulted in a more bluesy sound than earlier, Lord dropped his organs and Blackmore wasn't that wild than earlier, but this album sure has highlights like the title song, \\"Might Just Take You Life\\", \\"Sail Away\\", \\"You Fool No One\\", \\"Mistreated\\" and the instrumental \\"'A' 200\\", good album, it's worth buying.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|Modified--as I listen again & again, I know that this CD is like wine. It gets better with age. Initially, I was only impressed by just a couple of songs, not as good a CD as Trouble is, yet felt it was money well spent but then I couldn't get some of the darn songs out my head! Does anyone know what is being said in the background of Be Here Now and Empty? It's very low but there is something in each song. Tops on my list-Empty, You Can Bring Me Flowers & Lesson Learned but oh how I wish he had made the lyrics \\"Shall we call this a lesson WE HAVE learned?\\" I think it would have flowed a lttle better. Maybe in concert. Just a thought but then again, I'm musically talented challenged.
B000005RTG|5.0|Band Personnell: <br />David Coverdale - Vocals <br />Tommy Bolin - Guitars and Vocals <br />Glenn Hughes - Bass and Vocals <br />Ian Paice - Drums <br />Jon Lord - Keyboards <br /> <br />After Blackmore's departure many fans thought it was the end of Deep Purple, but Coverdale soon hired Tommy Bolin, an american who was most known as a guitar player in Zephyr (1969-71). <br />This lineup only managed one album, and it shows great riffs from the new Deep Purple guitarist, and for those who didn't like Stormbringer much, will eventually like this one better, it's actually less funky and have more highlights as \\"Comin' Home\\", \\"Lady Luck\\", \\"Gettin' Tighter\\", \\"Dealer\\", \\"Love Child\\" and \\"You Keep on Moving\\". <br />Tommy showed new life to Deep Purple, buy the album, it's great.

B00006FM77|5.0|Beautifully remastered, excellent packaging. This set contains a fourth disc which you hear some really awesome Terry Kath guitar solos. The fourth disc really solidifies the great guitar work of Terry Kath. The extra disc includes \\"an hour in the shower\\" which makes the price of this set worth buying, and is a must for any hardcore Chicago fan. The fourth disc was done under Lee Loughane's supervision and painstakingly mixed by veteran engineer Dave Donnelly.I am not a live album fan, but Carnegie Hall really has some tunes that closely match the studio recordings beautifully. The horns and flutes are really loud and sharp and really stand out while listening. I enjoyed this live recording.Carnegie Hall was done when James William Guercio was the producer of Chicago records, long before the days of David Foster who turned them into a 1980s hit machine. Foster during the 1980s helped Chicago score some huge hits, while Chicago became nothing more than Peter Ceteras back up band, setting up Ceteras own solo career. Foster also limited drummer Danny Seraphines drumming during the 80s recordings. Carnegie Hall, catches Chicago in an incredible stage of thier career. The remastering  has been done with great care and expertise. Rhino has done another excellent job with the packaging, includes (booklet and posters). One thing that amazes me is while reading the booklet I found out Chicago has been putting on live shows since May 23rd, 1967 and still going strong today, amazing! Enjoy carnegie hall if you dont like live recordings you might make an exception for \\"Chicago at Carnegie Hall\\"
B000ETRCMQ|3.0|This movie is full of clichés.  There is the sexually-confused man who fathered a child, but had no contact with him.  The boy who grows up not knowing his parents and becomes a street-bum.  The flower-child who is a degenerate in disguise.  The protagonist who is a complete woman in outlook, although a complete man physically.  The therapist who has a sixth sense of premonition.  Felicity Huffman, however, gives a stellar performance.  She is very convincing, very credible as either sex. <br />
1881273156|4.0|After having been recently engaged, numerous people offered advice on marriage counselling books. My barber recommended this particual book as she felt it would be interesting to read. I thought this book was a good compliment to the first few chapters of \\"Lies at the Alter\\" which I had read a week earlier. The author suggests that each person has a unique way of feeling when they are loved and this book breaks it down into 5 categories. In the back is a test to determine which of the 5 sections one belongs in. Both my fiance and I took the test and we feel that the definitions suit us pretty well. I don't feel this book is the complete and singular solution to a happy marriage, but it certainly will help.
B000GFLKF8|1.0|This is an attempt at sophistication that just doesn't hack it.  Jodie Foster's character, for one example, is so pretentious and obnoxious that one is tempted to reach into the screen and slap her face. <br /> <br />The language that everyone uses, particularly the Mayor, is so full of obscenities that it is just not credible.  Filthy language for the sake of filthy language is just filthy. <br /> <br />The story, where Denzel Washington's character appears to finally understand what is going on with the bank robbers, is just too obscure and nonsensical for anyone to figure out, even Denzel Washington. <br /> <br />If there is some kind of message her, like criminals will finally be found out and will receive justice, it is lost in the juvenile way in which this movie is presented.  Just plain awful.
B000GFLE86|5.0|The other positive amazon reviews speak plainly enough as to the sumptuous music on this disc. What I write is merely a slight riposte to the viewer next in line- Yes, she's no Billie Holiday. Nor was Nina Simone. Or Roberta Flack or Aretha Franklin. No more than Emmy Lou Harris or Dolly Parton were pale imitations of Loretta Lynne and Tammy Wynette. I'm glad all of those women put out records and followed their own paths and muses, regardless of who came before them and paved the way. Billie Holiday herself was no Bessie Smith.<br /><br />At any rate, Ms. Peyroux is far far more than a Billie impersonator with an impeccable french accent. Moreover, while the curmudgeons, cranks and fogeys of the world are very much entitled to view the world through their own woebegotten sense of what is or is not a 'classic,' it's not their place to foist their all-too-arbitrary and subjective sense of aesthetics on the rest of us... We who might want to take a chance on something new. Don't get me wrong. Long live the church of Billie. But when you judge the world with her as your sole criteria, you loose out.<br /><br />Besides, to my knowledge, there are no extant recordings of Billie Holiday covering songs by Serge Gainsborg, Joni Mitchell and Leonard Cohen, among others. Maybe I'll hear Billie singing 'Suzanne,' in my dreams, but then skullbound reveries are rather difficult to bootleg, are they not...?<br /><br />One more thing I'd like to point out: they say that imitation is the highest form of flattery but that's a half-truth at best. Inspired interpretation and creative translation are bolder forms of paying homage. Ms. peyroux never simply covers a song; she has the audacity and flare to not only try new things with the tunes she loves- she makes them her own. Imitation is the class clown aping an Ace Ventura routine. What this woman does with the songs she plays is in an entirely different class... Ms. Peyroux's other CDs are just as exquisite. In fact, her cover of Elliott Smith's 'Between the Bars,' is perhaps the best cover of a Smith tune ever. Give her a listen, you will not be disappointed.cover of Elliott Smith's 'Between the Bars,' is perhaps the best cover of a Smith tune ever. Give her a listen, you will not be disappointed.
0393327655|4.0|In \\"The End of Faith\\", Sam Harris states that faith is the single most dangerous thing in the world, and does a very good job proving his point. There's nothing spectacular about his claim and few rational people would disagree that the combination of faith in heaven and hell and divine moral laws are dangerous (he uses the Inquisition as an example), especially in combination with modern weapons; but Harris puts into words what many of us have been thinking, and he also points out certain things that at least I hadn't yet thought about, perhaps because it's politically incorrect.  <br /> <br />Most reasonable people will Agree with Harris that the rules of public discourse need to change. There's no reason why religious beliefs should be immune to criticism. In order for us to solve our problems and disputes, we must be able to think rationally and focus on this life, instead of killing eachother off hoping to get to heaven. We can't have authorities that are immune to criticism because they claim to be doing god's work. We can't let irrational beliefs be an obstacle in medical research or in the work of preventing AIDS in Africa.  <br /> <br />Harris acknowledges the human need for spiritual experiences and devotes the last chapter explaining how a rational spirituality could replace irrational faith.  <br /> <br />Some have critisized the book for drawing parallels between religious fundamentalism and Naziism and Stalinism, but the comparision is valid. The book is a call for reason and isnot just against religious fundamentalism, but against all sorts of fundamentalist and totalitarian belief systems that require a person to ignore evidence that don't coincide with their irrational beliefs, be they religious or political idoelogical. <br /> <br />Harris makes some questionable statements regarding US foreign policy, but overall, he makes a very strong case for his viewpoint, that faith is dangerous. It's a very important subject. Atheists will find much to agreewith and some theists may get offended. \\"The End of Faith\\" it's certainly worth reading for theists, atheists and agnostics alike.

B000GPI2EK|5.0|(Alternate review title: *It's Heavy to be Square*) Mega-metal is back for sure, and there's no need for rockers to brood about how depressed they are anymore. Dig Mastodon for advaning power riffs and neck-breaking rhythms into the future, while making it cool again to write lyrics as if one was living in a dark fantasy novel or a role-playing game. If you think they're squares, so be it, because they'll blast you right off the stage. The band's sound is still progressing at a meteoric rate, and this album is a little more controlled (but a little less explosive) than the punishing Leviathan. Troy Sanders and Brent Hinds are trading lead vocal parts back and forth much more, adding some effective variety to the songs. Of special note are \\"Sleeping Giant\\" and \\"This Mortal Soil\\" in which Mastodon sounds surprisingly believable in mid-tempo, slowly stomping the listener into submission, not unlike the namesake prehistoric beast slowly goring a cro-mag. The guys are also no longer chicken about their prog pretensions and flaunt them with no remorse, leading to vertiginous riffs and bizarre time signatures that somehow work even though they should have no place in power metal.<br /><br />The prog does gets a little out of hand in a few places, like the gruesomely twisted \\"Circle of Cysquatch,\\" and partial riffs borrowed directly from King Crimson and Tool pop up occasionally. The oppressive grind and twist also overwhelm guest stars Josh Homme (Queens of the Stone Age) and Cedric Bixler-Zavala (Mars Volta), making those special appearances the musical equivalent of name-dropping. These trends could be of concern to longtime Mastodonheads, though the band is still perfectly capable of focusing their brutal grind into some of the meanest and crushingest metal around. And all hail the monstrously hyper drummer Brann Dailor, who somehow manages to keep time while just barely controlling himself in his non-stop rolls and fills. That dude must have eight arms and a clock in his brain - I don't know how he does it. If you dig HEAVY - in every possible sense of the word - jump on the back of this beast before it runs you over.

B000H305U0|4.0|Let me start out by saying that I hate pop music - always have, always will. But fortunately, this album is more R&B/Trip Hop than Pop, and it is VERY good - not 5-star great, even though it does have some 5-star songs:  Lovstoned/I think that she knows, My Love and Until the End of Time.  <br /> <br />Timberlake quickly establishes that he is not afraid to step out of the typical pop- song structure - he and Timbaland give the tracks depth with layering of instruments, electronic sounds and beatbox backing vocals.  (i.e. this is no Jessica Simpson \\"Public Affair\\").  He is undeniably talented and clearly takes his craft seriously.  He doesn't seem interested in releasing formulaic, routine pop music, like the rest of the  \\"factory\\": You know the culprits - Jessica & Ashlee, Lindsey, Hillary, Paris, and yes, Britney.  (Ever wonder how they can record and release albums so quickly?)  Timberlake has taken his time and takes risks that create an unexpectedly enjoyable album. <br /> <br />\\"FutureSex/Lovesounds\\" (a horrible title) definitely continues with Timberlake's R&B-influenced pop, as well as some electronica/trip-hop laced, dance songs.  At points, the lyrics are just plain silly, but you can usually forgive it because the music behind them is danceable i.e. SexyBack. <br /> <br />The album really takes flight with the lovely ballad \\"My Love.\\"  I am a person that absolutely loathes and despises pop ballads, but Timberlake and Timbaland are able to create a new and completely mesmerizing song, with the synthesized beats, limited bass and compelling vocals.  This is a great and very catchy song for any genre. <br /> <br />The next song starts a wonderful trend on the album - the interludes.  \\"What Goes Around,\\" is most assuredly a track about Timberlake's ill-fated relationship with Britney Spears, despite his claims to the contrary.  This is not only a well-crafted, lyrically spot-on track, but it is also musically diverse, containing some interesting instrumentation choices.  It is the interlude near the end of the song where Timberlake is really driving the point of this song home - powerful, yet vulnerable, lyrics lead the listener to believe that Timberlake is not quite over his first love. <br /> <br />The next gem is \\"Lovestoned.\\" It starts out as a great dance track, but midway through, changes to a beautiful and haunting guitar-laced interlude.  Timberlake launches into his falsetto, and it becomes a great song, with the unexpected and brave (especially for a pop-star) rendition of the \\"I think that she knows\\" lyrical bridge. <br /> <br />And finally, the best song on the album: \\" Until the End of Time.\\"  Quite simply, this is the best song that Timberlake has ever done, and far exceeds any other song released this year by a major artist. Using early Prince as an influence, the song pulses with a well-known drum machine loop, but Timberlake is able to convey feelings without ever sounding sappy or corny.  He is at his best in his falsetto, which is perfectly suited for this track and gives the song its soul.  It is an instantly liekable and catchy love song. <br /> <br />This album is worth a listen for any music enthusiast - even those who despise pop music. Crossing the genres of R&B, Pop, Dance, Electronica and Hip-hop, \\"Futuresex/Lovesounds\\" establishes Timberlake as the preeminent mainstream artist against which all others will have to live up to.
B000I2IT44|5.0|I have been following these guys since 2001 only, bought everything and have enjoyed the progression since a \\".. on a given Sunday\\" up to \\"Deadwing\\" without a single compplaint. This guys are sweetly darkly unique...  sentimental and dark....   with an upbeat groove. Just some words to describe them. All of it is shown on this live concert. Perfectly performed, great sound and simple but excellent editing. <br />  NO COMPLAINTS. Actually I'm bying another copy from amazon at 14 bucks, even though that I have allready number 1135 from 2000 bought directly from the Burning Shed.  <br /> <br />    A must if you like only one of their CD's/.....
B00001OH1S|5.0|This is a fantastic score and I highly recommend it. While Sting does not do the best ever recording of \\"Windmills of Your Mind,\\" it's still very good, relaxing, and sets up the rest of the CD well.  <br />Simone's \\"Sinnerman\\" is either something you do or do not like. Personally the vocals get to be repetitive and irritating after a while, but the piano and hand-clapping are definitely something to be heard, especially since they bring back the enjoyed memory of Brosnan and the other men clad in their \\"business suits and bowler cap\\" shuffle game for the film's final climax. I tend to skip the vocals, but still listen to the track. <br /> \\"Everything is Never Quite Enough\\" is one of my favorite songs on this CD, even though there are so many different languages in the lyrics. The sounds and beat are incredible, stirring all the right emotions, while the lyrics are sultry and perfectly placed together. As said before, there are different languages sung in the song (the woman sings English, but the male sings French, his native African dialect, and some various others), but they all compliment each other and it is not at all annoying. It is excellent. <br />\\"Kaban a la Kratchie\\" is another track that you like or you don't...it depends on one's mood. Overall it is enjoyable and nostalgic of the Caribbean and the stunning photography of the scenes filmed in the tropics, but you need to be in a light-hearted mood and \\"enjoying the day\\" attitude to fully appreciate the song. <br />The rest of the songs are all Bill Conti's music and his score - no lyrics. The basic theme is reheard in the music, but the pace and background instruments are certainly different so you can listen to the entire CD without getting bored and can feel your pulse quicken with the music. The score certainly brings back the movie and the entire attitude of sophistication, intelligence, and smoothness. A great CD to listen to while driving, working, reading, basic background music, or for just plainlistening to.  <br />I highly recommend it and you will most certainly not have any buyer's remorse. <br />

Do you ever find a great pattern, only to see that it isn't written for your size? Have you ever wondered how the heck the knitters of the past managed to make all those pretty sweaters without patterns? <br /> <br />If so, Elizabeth Zimmermann's humorous, intelligent, even reckless approach to knitting (she cuts into her work! deliberately creates runs! mixes dye lots!) might free you to break loose.  <br /> <br />From a deep knowledge of knitting history and technique, Zimmermann demystifies the craft and gives both the instructions and the \\"permission\\" a knitter might need to truly make knitting her own.
B000G03RJA|5.0|Few people remember Laura Branigan's first hit single, \\"All Night With Me.\\" It reached #60 a few months before the career-establishing megasmash \\"Gloria\\" hit the airwaves and shot to #2. That first hit has been so forgotten, in fact, that both Branigan's U.S. hits collections (\\"The Best of Branigan\\" and \\"Essentials\\") completely ignore the tune. Happily, this UK compilation presents the song, along with most of Branigan's other Hot 100 entries. \\"All Night With Me\\" is a great record, and it's a real treat that it has finally been remastered and presented on a hits CD.    With that said, this is THE Laura Branigan collection to own. The hits everyone knows are here (\\"Gloria,\\" \\"Solitaire\\" and \\"Self Control\\"), along with smaller but solid hits like \\"The Lucky One,\\" \\"Power of Love\\" and \\"Spanish Eddie.\\" And of course, Branigan's #1 smash \\"How Am I Supposed To Live Without You\\" from 1983 is here. And all these hits sound crisp and layered with the superb mastering job provided by Heathmans Studios.    There are a few head-scratchers, of course. Where is the hit \\"Hold Me\\"? Granted, it hit low in the Hot 100, but it was a hit and is a sexy, vibrant record. Instead of this song, or the single \\"Cry Wolf,\\" listeners get two rather negligible ballads (\\"If You Loved Me\\" and \\"Lovin' You Baby\\") from Branigan's 1982 debut album and \\"Silent Partners,\\" an okay song from Branigan's 1984 album. These tracks' inclusion is extra annoying, because all the material from Branigan's splendid and thoughtful 1993 \\"Over My Head\\" album is ignored.    Still, this is the very best Laura Branigan hits collection that has ever been available. The lovely, late vocalist sounds astonishing on every song, especially \\"Solitaire\\" (what a range!!!). Let's hope that someday a record label (read: Rhino) will make a two-CD collection of her work that includes all the hits, rare tracks and choice album tracks, like \\"Shadow of Love,\\" one of Branigan's best recorded performaces.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|a great, textured collection of music. it's almost too much to take in at once. listen to it several times, let the songs live inside you and you'll find that the music will open up and engulf you.
B000001FW9|5.0|the last guy said warmth.  i tend to agree.  how about mood, though.  what other album creates a mood like this one.  there are concept albums, and there are double albums, but I don't think anyone quite gets across a \\"feeling\\" like GG do on this one.  while there's still a lot of complexity on this album, there's still some \\"nativity\\" (yeah, I went there) on this one.  it might just be the production (i also love T.Rex's Electric Warrior similiarily and inexplicalbly), thanks to Visconti, that creates this autumnish-spooky-yet-groovy mood (if you doubt my belief, check out bowie's Man Who Sold the World), but there's still something even more than that that makes this, honestly, MY FAVORITE ALBUM OF ALL TIME.  i don't love GG.  i don't think they're the best band ever.  but god bless, what happened on this album that made this so freakin' perfect?!  and why the hell has it not been rereleased!  Come ON!  give me a good version of this to listen to on my nice speakers!  it's not fair.  i guess this isn't so much as a review, then, as an exposition of beliefs (i really like tony visconti's production in the early seventies, (infer) i like mellotrons and moogs and odd time signatures).  take away what you want from this review.  this is a good band.  not great.  this album, however, is PERFECT.  Moods, energy, musicianship, production--all great.  I just wish the sound were better!
B000FQJAIW|1.0|I could write so much on this subject... I'll just stick with the review of this new DVD. <br /> <br />YOU DON'T RELEASE A MOVIE IN 4:3 LETTERBOX IN THIS DAY AND AGE!  George Lucas was the one pushing for all-digital theatres and all that. And now he disrespects the work of all the people that helped him make Star Wars a success in the first place back in 1977.  <br /> <br />I bought a DVD player originally so that I would own the original Star Wars on DVD. I got an HDTV compatible widescreen TV to see it in at least standard 16x9 anamorphic resolution. (like 94 % of big movie DVD`s out there..)Now I realise.. After all those years of waiting, George Lucas is sooooo thick... He just WON'T give fans what THEY really want... All those people who made him rich. <br /> <br />Go to hell, George Lucas.

B00005MP58|4.0|I am well aware that this film is still a favourite for many Jane Austen's fans. So I won't be too harsh with this review. This BBC Pride and Prejudice is undoubtedly the best adaptation of the book. The most important passages of the novel are there and Jane Austen's witty dialogues haven't practically been altered. Even the characters correspond to the original story and we can give credit to the actors who make them so alive. Mrs Bennet is desperately annoying thanks to Allison Steadman who makes her as whiny and as bad-tempered as possible. Mr Collins is so unappealing and so silly that it is no wonder that Lizzie Bennet does her best to avoid him. Colin Firth plays a dashing Darcy without a fault. He is so rude and so conceited that I feel the urge to slap him especially when he cruelly says to his friends about Elizabeth Bennet \\"she a beauty! I should as soon call her mother a wit\\". Thank God, his attitude changes a little for the better afterwards. I also love Anna Chancellor in the part of Miss Caroline Bingley. She is so deliciously mean that I can't resist laughing at the expense of the heroine. She always manages to put on her face all the hypocrisy of the character and the dislike that she feels for Elizabeth Bennet.         So yes, this film is BBC at its best. It is very well shot. You can see that the cast and the crew put all their energy into making this film. The setting is perfect (what horrible wallpapers though!!!), the costumes are great and you can at leisure see the actors eating, dancing, walking in the countryside, and riding horses. It is also perfect for the students or school teenagers who have to study the book but wish to avoid reading it. For, in five hours (at least), the film can give them a detailed insight of the novel. Some of my friends didn't particularly like the book but since they saw this version on my DVD, they have changed their mind about the book. (can't tell you how happy I was, since I love the book so much).        That being said, I consider that there are still some flaws in it. For example, I don't understand why Ehle is running in the park the morning after Darcy's proposal, as if nothing between them had happened.  Her reaction to his words of love comes a little late for me. If I remember well, Lizzie is pretty shaken by that proposal in the book. Another problem concerns the cast. The features of Suzanna Harker who is supposed to play the beautiful Jane (R.Pike fit better the part) are not really remarkable. I am not saying that the actress is not pretty but that she sometimes seems a bit `dull' compared to Jennifer Ehle whose looks are more stunning. The actress in the part of Charlotte Lucas is not plain enough as well but the mistake in the casting is especially obvious with the red-haired actress who is supposed to play the plain Miss King and each time I hear Maria Lucas say about her \\"She is not very pretty, isn't she?\\", my first reaction is \\"What??? Not pretty? She is absolutely gorgeous!\\"      But then, I am not drawn to this version the way I am to the 2005 movie with Keira Knightley and MacFadyen although I still enjoy watching it very much. The problem is that Andrew Davies recreated the scenes almost exactly as they are in the book (there are only one or two exceptions, the most popular one being the scene with Darcy diving into the lake and appearing dishevelled and wet in front of Lizzie which is a gorgeous scene, I grant you!) and so the BBC version is a bit too classical. It sometimes lacks in intense, emotional moments and in spontaneity. Maybe I am too romantic but I was much more thrilled by the passionate, near-kissing and under-the rain- proposal scene with Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen, although the dialogues had been changed, than by Firth and Ehle's classic, indoor scene. One scene that I enjoy tremendously in the 2005 version is when Rosamund Pike/ Jane tearfully say `Yes, a thousand times yes!' to Simon Woods. Why is that? Because the actress manages to show exactly what it must be like for a young woman of that period to get at last a proposal from the man she loves, because the scene reflects the beauty of first love. When Colin Firth/Darcy renews his feelings to Lizzie, I am always a bit frustrated ( though I know it is like that in the book) because there is not the joyful reaction that I expected on Firth/Darcy's face when Lizzie tells him about her new feelings. That is why I prefer the 2005 movie's climactic scene with a dishevelled MacFadyen claiming once more his love for Lizzie at dawn and a K. Knightley who can't stand still afterwards, impatient as she is, to get her father's consent!   What I mean to say is that I love both version but not for the same reasons because after all they are very different. And I would definitely advise this BBC version to those who are already great fans of the book. It has really great moments and Ehle and Firth do have chemistry. Maybe they could have shown it more often but that is my opinion. Just like for 'North and South', you don't notice time flying by although it is 5 hours long...
1844137864|5.0|No artist comes close to the emotional impact he makes in this work. Brilliant-Brilliant-Brilliant. <br />He's a commercial outsider anti-propagandist with compelling important social messages. <br />I love this guy. <br />Every page is a treasure. No filler here.
B00003Q43A|5.0|This is the ultimate \\"Us VS Them\\" epic. How can you hate it? It has great special effects, great music, plenty of humor, and characters who are more sympathetic than most. It's meant to be FUN people. And it's a hell of a lot more fun than those crappy Star Wars prequels. <br /> <br />As usual, Jeff Goldblum is the scene stealer as a quirky genius, and Will Smith does his usual tough, smart, funny persona bit. Bill Pullman is alright as the President; his wife is played by the lady from \\"Dances With Wolves\\". Judd Hirsch is fun as Jeff's dad. <br /> <br />Sure there are problems with the plot - the fact that this all happens in the pan of 3 days is ridiculous. Maybe there are too many characters and maybe the film is long, but this isn't a terrible crime. The film isn't BAD. The destruction of the cities are well done and the climax is rousing in the tradition of the classic Star Wars trilogy. <br /> <br />If you want a really bad science fiction film, go watch the above mentioned Star Wars prequels, \\"Phantom Menace\\" and \\"Attack of the Clones\\".
B000FQJAIW|5.0|From the day I was born to, well, just about a month ago, I never had any interest in the Star Wars movies.  Well, I decided that I would rent this one and at least give it a chance.  As it turned out, Netflix had a very long wait on this dvd, so I went ahead and bought it.  Easily worth the $20 and I would have spent $30 or so had that been the case.  Well, I am planning on buying the next two and I will not miss the $40 I spend on them.<br /><br />P.S. All you whiners, just get over it.  Be grateful for what you've got.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|Well here they are - all four of the Batman films made circa 1989-1997, all of them slicked up with trailers, audio commentaries, archive interviews, music videos, making of documentarie, character profiles, overview of Batman, everything die hard fans could possibly want. Even those who hate the Joel Schumacher helmed \\"Batman Forever\\" and \\"Batman & Robin\\" will find something interesting in the behind scenes material, chronicling the long, strange journey of Batman through the cinematic age.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I watched 3/4 of this movie in a theatre until we had a POWER OUTAGE. So  appropriate. It is VERY scary--our whole world's climate is changing. I plan to buy and show this film to all the family and friends that I can. Gore is 'right on' on this topic, and this is a lifelong concern of his, as it should be for all of us. This is definitely a 'must see' movie.
B00005UW9T|5.0|Plot in a nutshell - at the beginning of the 20th century, Russia is thrown into chaos when Czar Nicholas and most of his family is killed thanks to a curse by the evil \\"sorcerer\\" Rasputin (voice of Christopher Lloyd), but one daughter, Anastasia (voiced by Kirsten Dunst as a child), manages to survive, for better or worse, but with amnesia. Years later, the adult Anastasia (voiced by Meg Ryan, once of one of Hollywood's most sought after actresses, her career now in a state of severe disrepair thanks to her much over publicized fling with Russell Crowe), known only as Anya, is released from a Russian orphanage with no memory of her past, her only clue being a necklace with an intimate message written on it that indicates Paris as a place of importance. In trying to get to Paris, she falls in with two charmingly lovable scoundrels, Dmitri (voice of John Cusack) and Vlad (Kelsey Grammar); the two con-men intend to present an \\"Anastasia\\" lookalike to the Duchess (voice of Angela Lansbury), the last surviving member of the Royal Family, who is holding meetings with girls claiming to be Anastasia in hopes of finding the real one so that they can get the reward money she's offering. Initially unaware that Anya is the real Anastasia but merely assuming that she is an uncanny lookalike, Dmitri & Vlad decide to clean Anya up and present her to the Duchess. Along the way, long buried secrets are revealed and unexpected feelings arise as the nearly dead Rasputin and his bat sidekick Bartok try to destroy the trio. <br /> <br />Beautifully animated feature courtesy of Don Bluth, you'd almost swear this was one of the great Disney features. Strong animation is complimented by competent voice acting by the big stars, notably Meg Ryan throwing out her perkiest voice possible. Historically inaccurate, but who cares?

B000ASATZ8|4.0|Like many fans, I grew up around these films.  When I heard that they were to release a box set I was very, very excited.  Upon getting this box set as a gift I was shocked to discover that... <br /> <br />1) The only season of Tremors: the Series is not included in this set and the Sci-Fi channel still has it locked away in their vault.   <br />2) The majority of the special features are gone except for those of the first film and about half of the fourth film.  The fourth film I had rented once and saw a very entertaining short film and I was shocked to discover it was no longer there.   <br />3) The movies are on 2 duel sided discs, meaning that they are cheap and prone to damage if you are not extremely careful with them.   <br /> <br />On the good side though, you do get all four films for the low price of 20 dollars.  I love all of the tremors films (yes even the third one which gets a bad rap, even by me sometimes), I hope that some day there will be a fifth one and that even though the series deserves a much better box set, this one will do until the one day release the TV series and the rumored 5th film.  Hoped this review helped.
B000GFLKF8|4.0|I have said it before, and it remains true: I enjoy every second when I see Denzel Washington on the screen.  He is about as engaging an actor as there is.  Yet he keeps each character fresh and different.  True, I enjoy some performances more than others and some of the films he is in I can't even work myself up to seeing.  But when I do, he is always most engaging.  This is a movie I would not have watched except that he is in it.  I had heard less than enthusiastic things about it, but decided to give it a try.  After all, if Denzel is in it, well, it has to have some redeeming qualities.<br /><br />So, how was it?  Well, while I was watching it I was quite engaged.  The actors are all very good and give more than fine performances.  And I think Spike Lee has done a terrific job in putting this film together.  After it is over, and you think back on aspects of the plot, which I will not go into here, because you shouldn't know any more going in than it is a bank robbery, you will realize that Lee has pulled a big rabbit out of a very small hat.<br /><br />I have already said that Denzel's performance as Det. Keith Frazier is terrific.  His partner, Det. Bill Mitchell is played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, whom I first noticed as \\"The Operative\\" in \\"Serenity\\".  He is just as engaging here in a vastly different role.  Jodie Foster is another of my favorites, and she does very well with what she is given here.  But here role here is more like the function of a magician's assistant than a protagonist.  Her character, Madeline White, allows the paranoids in the audience to believe this is how the broader culture actually works and White allows certain points of exposition to happen rather than having any real payoff.  I am saying that I still love Jodie Foster, but this role was a dud DESPITE her fine acting.<br /><br />Arthur Case, played by the great Christopher Plummer, is not quite believable because he would have to be about twenty years older than Plummer is and would have to have made some decades long very stupid choices for no explicable reasons in order for this plot to work.  Clive Owen is the other main character, Dalton Russell.  He has a hard job because in most of the movie his face and body are mostly covered.  I still don't know how Owen's character learned enough to target what he was after in this movie.  If he had discovered the materials and objects by accident, that would have been different.  But the plot has him going only after these items.  We can project motives on him afterwards, but I don't recall the movie making clear how he gained the intelligence and what his motivation actually was for such a difficult and risky crime.<br /><br />Anyway, a decent heist film while you watch it.  I just don't recommend thinking about it too much along the way or afterwards.would have to have made some decades long very stupid choices for no explicable reasons in order for this plot to work.

B000K7VHQE|5.0|\\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is the story of the Hoover Family. Olive (played by the adorable and very funny Abigail Breslin) has just been accepted into the \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" beauty pageant (because of a cancellation) and her family decides to drive through three states so she can make the competition on time. Richard Hoover (played by former Talk Soup host, Greg Kinnear) is Oliver's dad who believes that winning is number one. When Richard tells poor Olive that she shouldn't eat ice-cream (because there aren't any fat Miss America contestants) I thought it was both extremely funny and also equally sad.     Paul Dano played Olive's (very comical) morbidly hate-filled brother, Dwayne. Alan Arkin played the coke-snorting, sex-crazy grandfather. Toni Collette was the kids' mom Sheryl; it was obvious that Sheryl was wrapped way too tight but she really did love her family. And rounding out this ensemble cast is Uncle Frank (played by \\"Forty Year Old Virgin\\" star Steve Carell.) Frank came to stay with Sheryl and her family after he recently tried to commit suicide after his homosexual love of interest rejected him.     So the family embarks on a car trip across NV, AZ, and CA in a broken down, old 70's bus (they have to push it to get it started!)     There are so many funny moments in this picture. It was also touching to see Olive put her head on her brother's shoulder to try to cheer him up, and I did suspect at that moment that Dwayne actually didn't hate everyone because he seemed so sensitive.     Anyone that watches this picture will certainly agree that Olive's dance routine was the hit of the entire movie. Olive dances to the tune of the Rick James hit \\"Super Freak\\" while prudish Pageant Official Jenkins (played perfectly by one-time \\"Malcolm In The Middle\\" star Beth Grant) goes absolutely BERSERK! I don't want to give anything away, but the entire family was involved, a huge scene resulted, and the police were even called!     After watching the first thirty minutes of this movie I thought to myself, \\"why are these people all together...\\" ...But I suppose family is whatever you make of it and the Hoover family must have really loved each other to go through all they did and still stay together. Maybe they don't make the same decisions as the \\"traditional American family\\" but that's ok because they still find their own happiness.     I reluctantly went to go see this movie after a friend told me how good it was. I protested because it looked totally ridiculous but my friend had already seen it and he insisted that it was a superior picture. And I am so glad that I went because this was one of the best movies I have seen in months. It is dysfunction at it's funniest!
B00005JMJG|4.0|You almost can't put this movie completely together the first time you see it.  It takes the whole film to \\"get it.\\"  Then, the second time is AMAZING.  Since I've had the DVD I've watched three or four times and each time I'm blown away by the concept, the visuals and the message. <br /> <br />Best Lines (SPOILER STUFF): <br /> <br />Clementine: \\"I'm not a concept, Joel... I'm just a f*cked up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.  I'm not perfect.\\" <br /> <br />Joel:  \\"I don't see anthing I don't like about you.\\" <br /> <br />Clementine: \\"But you will.

B000HCO840|4.0|As with (almost) all movies that are not solely movies (such as movies made from books/comics), die-hard fans will rarely enjoy what Hollywood puts into these things. From the perspective of a X-men movie fan who has not read the comics and would occasionally watch the cartoons about a decade ago, I thought it was a great movie. <br /> <br />The movie had more pace than the first two. There were a lot of surprises or things you would not otherwise expect in a movie (which some may not like, but I thought made the plot more interesting). There were some points where I was like \\"What? Did that actually just happen? I must have missed something.\\" Nope, they were very bold with this plot. So if you expect one specific plot in this movie, let go of that and see it or maybe skip this one. <br /> <br />Anyways, it sounds like people are either hot or cold to the movie. I enjoyed it enough that I would say the risk of seeing it (and not liking it) is worth it. If you don't like it, forget about it and just watch the first couple again and again. But if you are like me and aren't tied to any specific plot or storyline, you will want to watch this over and over again. This is my favorite of the three with the second close behind. <br /> <br />!Slight spoiler alert! If you are extremely attached to all the characters and are unwilling to see some go (die), then you may not enjoy this movie. Not all of the main characters make it through.
B000H5U65C|5.0|These guys deserve to be the champions of the New Wave of American Metal. The first two fullengths are required listening for any true metalhead and this one is no different. At first I thought that it was a bit lower/melodic at times then the previous releases but I eventually grasped the concept/storytelling part of this journey and how the music is its soundtrack. The reviewer earlier who compares this to Metallica's \\"Black album\\" has to be a newbie to the scene. Just because at times you can understand the lyrics does not equate to an automatic \\"sell out\\" scream. This band pushes the boundries so that listeners get the best of both worlds w/ this release. The musicianship is simply top notch and blows away the Lamb of God, Tool & Slayer releases that had such high expectations. this one is the CD of the year!<br /><br />Oh yeah - the DVD is well worth the viewing. You watch a band that hangs and jams together, not like the LOG DVD.
B000H305U0|5.0|Can't say enough about this album.  I like all but two songs on this CD.  It is definitely a classic.  I was not a fan of Justified.  I figure, if you are going to pay money for a CD then at least most of the songs should be gems.  That was not the case with Justified (and it's a good thing I didn't spend my dough on it).  I bought FutureSex/LoveSound because of the song \\"My Love\\".  I think that is an amazing song, and I just assumed it would be the best track on the CD.  I WAS WRONG.  I am absolutely addicted to \\"Lovestoned\\" and it is JT at his best.  Amazing track.  \\"Chop Me Up\\" is also great (\\"Got me cryin' rivers like Timbaland and Timberlake\\").  It would be easier to tell you what songs I am not into than the ones that I do like.  Track #2 and the last song on the CD aren't my favorites, but I adore everything else on the CD.  This CD is not a waste of money.  In fact, it just solidies the fact that the Timbaland/Timberlake combo is a homerun.
B000F3TBIO|4.0|One of my favorite films of all time is Peeping Tom. Michael Powell is one of the great directors of all time. It's funny that the closely named Mike Patton has used this name for his new project. It is a big collaboration with many people that Patton has never met. The first track \\"Five Seconds\\" is much like Faith No More and features Odd Nosdam. Other people who show up on this are Dan The Automator and Amon Tobin. I am a big Kool Keith fan. So the song \\"Getaway\\" reminds me a little of Black Elvis and Prodigy. Good stuff. I also like \\"Kill The DJ\\" with Massive Attack. It's a little like some stuff off of 100th Window. Other people who show up on this are Kid Koala, Bebel Gilberto, and even Norah Jones. It's a sort of record that shows who are Patton's friends. It's all pretty good, but unlike some of his recent material. It's a valid statement.
B00005JOX6|3.0|It is an Adam Sandler film, but it is not `Spanglish' or `Punch Drunk Love.' That means `Click' has lots of Adam Sandler trademark jokes - silly and childish jokes with sudden outburst of violence, but the film is more than that. Actually the supporting actors including versatile Christopher Walken and beautiful Kate Beckinsale are far better than Adam Sandler who plays the main character or a one-joke story about a magical \\"universal remote.\\" The film is also sappy and sentimental, but the touching acting from Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner makes up for the loss of subtlety. <br /> <br />The film is not perfect, and its story looks as if shamelessly taken from `It's a Wonderful Life.' But one good idea almost makes up for the lack of originality, and that is ultimate `universal remote' that can manipulate your life as a TV remote control does. You can fast-forward what you don't like seeing, or replay the scenes of your life from the past. Surely it is a cool gadget, but it has some drawbacks. <br /> <br />I don't know why, but Adam Sandler's character, hard-working architect Michael Newman, won't be satisfied with his life even though he has two lovable kids and his loving wife is Kate Beckinsale. A weird clerk played by amusing Christopher Walken gives this magical universal remote to Michael, but he warns before giving it that it is non-returnable. When Michael realizes the true meaning of the word, the film gets very sentimental. <br /> <br />David Hasselhoff and Sean Astin also appear, and provide laughs by being humiliated by Sandler's character in the most obvious way. If you think there is something mean and brutal in some of the characters Sandler previously played, and you really don't like it, then you should not watch `Click' because Sandler's portrait of the workaholic father who intentionally breaks a toy of his neighbor's kid surely makes you uncomfortable. In `Click' everything will be eventually forgiven in a sugary way, but this is not the first time we witness that kind of redemption in Hollywood films.  <br /> <br />Well, to be honest, I didn't buy the sentimental ending, or I should say I liked Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner who played Sandler's parents better than Sandler who stays in the center of the film's last 15 minutes. I was more impressed with Christopher Walken and Jennifer Coollidge, both of whom play delightfully eccentric people so naturally. But Sandler's devoted fans might think differently. Perhaps they want more Gilmore or Madison, and perhaps Adam Sandler knows it. `Click' is funny, but not very funny if you're not Sandler's fan; and it is much better than `Anger Management' or abysmal `Little Nicky' but that does not mean that `Click' shows something new and great. Hopefully Sandler will show what he can do in his next film `Reign Over Me.' <br /> <br />But I still cannot understand -- if you are living with Kate Beckinsale, what else do you want more?
B000FG5Q1W|5.0|I have been looking forward to this one for a long time. I saw Primal Scream play a few years ago in San Francisco. It was an okay show. The audience was there to see Underworld. I ran into Bobby Gillespie at a show at the Hollywood Bowl. I guess he was in town mixing the record with Dave Sardy. This record is a back to basics. There are no electronics. No Stooges meet Krautrock. No mixes by Kevin Shields. The lineup of the band is a little different. It's a little raw and a little like Exile on Main Street. This is in evidence with the first single \\"Country Girl.\\" This is country rock in high style. \\"Nitty Gritty\\" is more Stones influenced rock. One of the best songs is \\"Suicide Sally & Johnny Guitar.\\" Roots rock meets hard rock. \\"We're Gonna Boogie\\" reminds me of The Kills. Alison Mosshart from the Kills sings on a few songs. \\"Dolls\\" is a real glam rock song. This is a pretty good record. It's a great mix of roots rock, Stones obsessions, and good old time rock and roll. There is no electronic weirdness and sound collages. This is a party album. It should go down well. Bobby Gillespie was sort of obscure a few years ago. But with the help of the Internet, he is like considered one of the coolest people ever.
B000FZETIO|5.0|This review will not debate the merits of the movie or how it stacks up against other teen movies. Rather, it is a review of this DVD edition and specifically the special features, of which there are many. If you are a fan, you will want this, even if you already own \\"Pretty in Pink.\\"<br /><br />The original ending, where Duckie and Andie end up together, is discussed by the various principal actors, including Molly Ringwald, Andrew McCarthy, and Jon Cryer as well as the director. You will find out why the original ending didn't work, and how the final ending was arrived at. There's also a \\"making of\\" featurette where we see the actors, director, etc. discussing the movie at the time it was being made and also new footage where they are looking back at it from 20 years down the road. A lot of time and effort was put into this DVD and I think it is nice the actors, director, producer, etc. took the time to reflect back on this film and what it meant to them. Yes, I know, it's just a movie and not an all-time great at that, but it's one I have a tremendous soft spot for and if you do too you will want to own this.<br /><br />I will mention for all those curious if James Spader makes an appearance that I don't think he does, although there are a couple of special features I haven't viewed as yet.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Monster's Inc. Is a fun movie for the entire family.  If you liked Toy Story & Finding Nemo, then you will without a doubt want this movie for your collection.
B000002J0P|5.0|for my generation. When the album appeared in the fall of 1969, I was just out of the Army and ready to use my college degree to conquer the world of East Coast journalism, marry my first and only girlfriend whom I thought had waited for me, and become rich and famous and happy for the first time in my life. Twenty-four months after I bought the record, I moved to the Southwest and married a woman I'd known for only a few weeks, and was working for a dead-end weekly paper. So much for the dreams of youth. But it isn't the fault of the record, which I wore out, along with millions of other buyers, throughout 1970-'71. It is hard to say which LP is better, this one, or the follow-up, Deja Vu. Both belong in the collections of anyone who likes singer-songwriters, super-groups, and good music. My first love's name was Judy, and so the suite for \\"Judy Blue Eyes\\", while penned by Steve Stills for his then-girlfriend Judy Collins, was my anthem also, for most of the two years that I played this Atlantic LP continually. It is not the only good song on the album, however. Neither Crosby, Stills, or Nash ever had any significant impact on American music as solo artists, but together, in this magical release, they were huge, and enduring.
0240808452|5.0|My copy of the original edition of Force has seen plenty of wear and tear since I try to always keep it handy when I'm drawing. But that one's going into retirement for this new expanded version. <br /> <br />Rather than the complex anatomies of some books and the stick figure and cylinder creations of others, Mattesi follows the animator's axiom of drawing verbs rather than nouns. Capturing the dynamic motion of a pose that is the prime factor in an appealing drawing. <br /> <br />This isn't an animation book per se, but no one interested in animation or any other form of figure drawing should pass up the lessons Mattesi teaches. The benefits of conveying movement and sheer LIFE in a still drawing can't be ignored. <br /> <br />Also with this version coming from a bigger publisher in Focal Press, the overall image quality is far higher than the somewhat pixel-y look of the pictures in the original. Plus an extra 50 or so pages of instruction isn't too shabby.
0395925037|5.0|the reason i  chose to recomend this book is because i belive it is the only one which tells the truth about nazi germany.its really not \\"racist propaganda\\" as the school systems would have you belive but an account of a man who loved his country so much,he tried to perfect it.its basicly just a philosophy book.remember ,hitlers allies in ww2 were a half black man ,mussolini and the japanese leader.so,if you want truth,read this book.if you want a bunch of tree huggin hippie bs,read any other book on the matter.this book was the most widely owned book in the world in its day.if you cant handle the truth,steer clear.if you want the german equivelant of  thomas paines's\\"common sense\\",then read it.
0156027321|4.0|At the beginning, two men meet and one tells the other of a great story he knows and compels attention from the other -- much like the beginning of great stories like \\"The Man Who Would Be King.\\"<br /><br />Then we learn much about the intracacies of the world of the beast -- as the narrator lived for years in a zoo managed by his family.  While watching the Discovery Channel in his own back yard, we read some fun stories, including those about a boy's hunt for religion [at one time he worships Thursday (Hinduism), Friday (Islam), Saturday (Judaism) and Sunday (Christianity) which leads his teasing brother to tell him to find three more and he would never have to work].<br /><br />Then the story really begins.  In great detail, we live with the tremendously wise and sometimes precocious teenager who lives and survives for 8 months on a lifeboat with a bengal tiger, a hyena, a zebra and a rat.  The escapades are great. The writing style is easy and the fluidity of the chapters almost mesmerizing.  He often writes short one- or two-page chapters, and then moves to another subject with a new chapter.<br /><br />The maturation of the boy evolves gently.  At first, he fishes little.  Eventually, we are experiencing Old Man and the Sea -- except the man is not old, the sea is the Pacific, and the big catch is not the fish, but rather the tiger.<br /><br />In the end, some of the confrontations and excitement are outright otherwordly.  Maybe the scenes are true, maybe they are manifestations of his dreary mind and soul.  In any event, they are great -- if not the greatest -- scenes in the book.  After a hundred or more pages of his vividly described drudgery of living on a small boat, the boy encounters scenes which only Star Trek fans or Robinson Crusoe readers could associate with.<br /><br />This was a fun adventure.  I imagine many schools will require this to be read by high school students in the future.
B000FQJAIM|1.0|I was very disappointed in what was supposed to be the original 1977 theatrical release of Star Wars. The scenes I noted cut when this film was released again just prior to Empire were not put back in the film. For example, the scene where Luke watches the opening battle with his field glasses, the exchange between Luke and Biggs where Biggs informs him that he is leaving the academy to join the rebellion, and of course, the exchange between the gangsters (a.k.a. Jabba (pre-worm version)et al) and Solo in the docking bay.<br /><br />This is definitely not the version I watched in the summer of 1977.
B00005JP87|3.0|I avoided \\"The Illusionist\\" for a long time. I like Edward Norton, I think Paul Giamatti is great, but how can anyone take any film with Jessica Biel playing a 19th Century Viennese Countess seriously? This is such a calculated move on everyone's part, it turned me off. The filmmakers were obviously looking for a pretty actress, with some name recognition, that they could afford. Biel was obviously looking for a film that would show \\"I'm a serious actress\\". Then, the reviews for Norton were lukewarm, so I had even more reason to stay away.<br /><br />During a family visit, the only film I hadn't seen that my mom and step dad would see was \\"The Illusionist\\". While Norton is rather lackluster and Biel doesn't fit, the film has a very stylized look making it worth a look as a bargain matinee or on DVD.<br /><br />Eisenheim (Norton), a magician, makes a triumphant return to Vienna, his hometown, after touring the world and earning a reputation for himself. He mesmerizes the audience with his illusions, including Chief Inspector Uhl (Giamatti). Soon, Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) hears of the magician and attends the performance with his fianc&eacute;e, Sophie (Biel). Asking for a volunteer, Eisenheim brings Sophie on stage and performs a trick. Later, he reminds her that they were once friends, as children. Eisenheim learns Sophie is unhappy and doesn't want to marry the Crown Prince, a man with a questionable past and a history of violence towards women. But what can Eisenheim do to correct the situation?<br /><br />Written and directed by Neil Burger, \\"The Illusionist\\", based on a short story by Steven Millhauser, is an interesting film to watch. Sepia tones flood every frame, given it the appearance of the old daguerreotypes. Throughout, Burger uses a number of old fashioned editing techniques, giving the film the appearance of an old silent film. Both of these elements, and the settings, combine to make for an almost lovely film.<br /><br />But then he has to deal with the actors and he is less successful on that front. Edward Norton has done some great work in his previous films, but As Eisenheim he seems almost lifeless. There are brief moments when he shows conflict, or emotion, but these are few and far between. From an actor with the talent of Norton, this is a disappointment. Norton is one of those actors who used to show so much promise, people called him the next Brando or Lancaster, but he hasn't shown that type of range or skill since \\"The Italian Job\\", a film he was forced to participate in because of a contractual obligation. If you want to go back to his last intense role that would probably have to be \\"American History X\\".<br /><br />Biel is, if anything, acceptable. But I can't help but imagine what an actress with the skill of Julianne Moore or Laura Linney might have done with the role. Yes, they are each too old, but their talent would have transformed this character. As it is, Biel is required to do little than stand around and look wistful. Thankfully, she doesn't try to do much of an accent. I get the feeling that would have transformed the film into high camp.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti is interesting as Chief Inspector Uhl, a man who initially welcomes the performances of Eisenheim, but when the Crown Prince recognizes the danger of the magician, quickly turns against the illusionist. Uhl is under the control of the Crown Prince and must do what he wants. Throughout, Giamatti manages to convey the characters conflict of emotions and feelings. But during the last few minutes, as Giamatti realizes the games that have been perpetuated upon him, he stares to the heavens as the camera circles him. As realization dawns, he claps, once. Leaving the theater, I remarked that he thankfully kept the clapping to a minimum. The one clap is corny enough, but to have the clapping continue and have Uhl remark \\"Bravo!\\", well, once again, we are approaching high camp.<br /><br />\\"The Illusionist\\" is an interesting film for the visuals, and this makes it worth a look at bargain matinee prices. Or perhaps on DVD. I doubt you will find little of interest in the actor's performances.atinee prices. Or perhaps on DVD. I doubt you will find little of interest in the actor's performances.
B000003TA4|5.0|Every once in a while, a really great album comes along and changes your life. I remember this year well and I still believe this is the greatest album of all time. Ok so Kurt Cobain wasn't the greatest guitar player ever and he couldn't really sing. But in my opinion that is not what makes a truly great album anyway. He wrote great songs, that are catchy, emotional and will stay in your head for a long long time.Credit must go to producer Butch Vig for bringing out the best in Nirvana. In my opinion Nirvana are the most influencial band since the Beatles, not necessarily the best, but they left a lasting impression on me. I still listen to this album today and love it as much as the day I bought it all those years ago. I just can't wait to see the look on my kids faces when I play it to them for the first time.
0380820846|3.0|After reading \\"The Duke and I\\", I couldn't wait until I got to read Colin's story, because I loved his personality and thought he was the one \\"Bridgerton\\" brother, that most interested me.  However, this story was just plain boring.  There really wasn't much romance in the book - instead the whole thing was pretty much on the revealing of \\"Lady Wistledown\\".(Which I had been curious about anyway)  I loved Colin, and was so looking forward to a good romantic story with him.  This was still a cute book, but the previous 3 were by far way better.
B000002BFZ|4.0|This album is not as bad as the critics hailed it to be. It certainly grows on you with each listen and was very much a cross over record for the band, showing a more relaxed, mature side to the band. And following the sales of the first 3 records the band earned the right to go down whatver path they pleased.<br /><br />I would say this would have to be the most eagerly anticipated album of all time, in my opinion anyway. The bands popularity had reached enormous heights by the end of 1995 and I had just seen the band live for my first time so I couln't wait to get my hands on this album. Having got the merkinball EP as an appetiser I couldn't wait for the main meal, but at first listen I must say I was very disappointed. Where was the Pearl Jam I had grown to love and rocked hard? I asked myself... While there were a couple of songs I liked instantly, like Hail, Hail and red mosquito, this album spent a good couple of years collecting dust on my shelf. I thought the design of the album sleeve was ridiculous, this was 1996 remember and CD cases were standard, although now it seems all bands have adopted this new design.<br /><br />So from memory I think it was Easter of 1999 that I really got into this album. Yield had already been released and I had seen the guys perform live once again. They played a few of the 'No Code' songs and they sounded great. Present Tense is by far the best song off the album, it starts off quite mellow before bulding into an in your face your knockout blow of a song. Other notable inclusions are Smile, Off He Goes and Around The Bend. This is very much Stone and Eddie's album and Stone even lends his vocal to a song 'Mankind' which is quite good.<br /><br />In summary, this album stands very much on its own in the Pearl Jam catalogue. There are no others like it, and from time to time, it deserves a listen, because it signified a fork in the road of the Pearl Jam journey.
0060922583|5.0|Michael Talbot succeeds in uncovering many of the heretofore unheard of ideas relative to our world. The unseen one. Having read some of those to which he references before reading Holographic Universe it gave me somewhat of a start to find I was on \\"the right path\\" for sure.  <br />  He has beenand is  a great warrior in the charge of The Light Bearers.  <br />I love referring his book to anyone who indicates they are waking up.  <br />  He is strongly touted in my soon to be published book.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000027RL|5.0|You hear your parents and grandparents talk about great records from there generations, well this is definitely a great record from my generation and one i will surely be telling my kids and grandkids about.<br /><br />While I still believe this is the best Pearl Jam record (only just), there are 2 things holding it back from being miles above the rest.<br /><br />Dave Krusen's drumming and Rick Parashers production. But the songs are great and we must remember that this is only there first album, and what a great debut nonetheless.<br /><br />From the intro of once, you know you're in for a hell of a ride. Most of the songs are written by stone and eddie with jeff ament lending out with a couple and the whole band is credited with release. However it is stones songs with eddie's lyrics that stand out the most. Even Flow and black are two of their best songs and always will be, and Alive, after being flogged to death after all these years is still, well....alive<br /><br />Its on this song Mike provides the most brilliant solo I've ever heard. I love this song to death and it still sounds great. Other great songs include once, porch and garden. The album closes with release, but never really closes because you will probably play it again, and again, and again, and again......<br /><br />I also have to note, what a great album cover. It was one of the things that attracted me to the band in the first place.<br /><br />This record owns its own piece of history now, and still sits proudly in my record collection. I own it on CD and vinyl, and the vinyl still sounds better.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|For the past week now, John Mayer's new cd \\"Continuum\\" has made about 5 rotations a day in more than one of my cd players, and for good reason. As an already momumental fan of John's, I have to say that I was expecting a lot and knew there would be no disappointment. I was more than correct. This soulful, and insightful, laid back pop-blues esque album comes at a perfect time. Following his latest project \\"Try\\" with the Trio, this cd only builds on the incredible career he has been putting together for the last 7 or so years. The Trio's guitar heavy blues jams have been the bridge between John's past solo works and his newest adventure. Those who do not support this entising new sound should be disreagrded for lack of any sort of musical taste. There is truth and emotion behind every touch of the forward button. Lyrically, I haven't heard anybody worthy of comparison these days. In a pop world filled with songs about historical places (namely \\"bridges\\") and nursery rhyme beats over droning untalented ramble, I couldn't have been any more excited for this day to come. John Mayer is an amazing musician, who has already achieved what most do in a lifetime, and all after only 15 years from the first day he layed hands on a 6-string. A perfect time for a triple threat to shine. In my mind, at this man's age, no one can touch him for his for his lyrical, signing, and guitar playing genius. He has gained the repect and recognition of his biggest idols and some of musics biggest names today. All while acquiring three Grammy's. Thats impressive ladies and gentleman. Very impressive. Can't wait to see what is to come. Room For Squares was what John was, Heavier Things was an evolution and Continuum marks what JM is today and will continue to be in time. Three true studio albums down.. \\"Continuum\\" indeed, continuum indeed.
B00064X3FE|5.0|In 1975, I could hardly wait to acquire Elton's new album, one of hundreds of thousands of people who bought the album as soon as it was available in record stores.  I placed the record on the player, sure that I was going to hear another \\"Yellow Brick Road.\\"  Then I was puzzled.  What kind of music was this?  It was not simple pop with catchy tunes.  It was, well, complicated; and sophisticated.  It was also Elton's first concept album, and it took me a while to realize that this album was the story of Elton and Bernie's rise to fame in what appeared to be a relatively short period of time, but which actually took from 1966 to occur.<br /><br />As I said, this music is very complicated, sophisticated, and beautiful.  There are some faster songs, but some of Elton's most carefully crafted music is here as well.  The album begins with the title tune, a rock song with a bit of country flavor that represents the flamboyant heart of Elton, and the quieter, western-loving style of Bernie Taupin.  The song alternates between a style reminiscent of \\"Madman Across the Water\\" to a style that was more fully realized in \\"Rock of the Westies.\\"<br /><br />In \\"The Tower of Babel\\" and \\"Bitter Fingers\\" the dynamic duo lament the difficulties of getting into the entertainment industry.  The first song is about the difficulty of entry, the second is about being a stable hack for a record company, churning out songs by the basketful to make ends meet, never seeming to work fast enough or to earn enough.  \\"Bitter Fingers\\" has a beautiful piano entry, which extends into the song.  Elton at his performing best.<br /><br />\\"Tell Me When the Whistle Blows\\" can play on several levels, depending on which part of the song.  The style of the song is quite similar to songs such as \\"Danny Bailey\\" or \\"I've Seen That Movie Too\\" from \\"Yellow Brick Road.\\"  There is a fast rock beat, but the violins give a rich, lush feel.  Part of the song longs for being home, and part of the song wonders whether the maturing individual in the song still has the talent and enthusiasm he had when he was a wild kid.<br /><br />Then comes \\"Someone Saved My Life Tonight,\\" one of the most phenomenal songs that Bernie and Elton have ever written.  This song is about a time when Elton was nearly ready to get married, and Bernie talked him out of it.  The complexity of this music is symphonic.  The piano chords and the harmonies are full and show Elton John having fully mastered the art of creating music.<br /><br />The next two songs, \\"Gotta Get a Meal Ticket\\" and \\"Better off Dead,\\" are faster, and are about aspects of being starving artists.  Both are decent songs, but they are preludes to the last three songs of the original album.<br /><br />\\"Writing\\" is a song about success.  Once we are successful, how long can we sustain that success?  Also, what will people in the future think about what we did.  Will it have meaning for them, and will they think it is good?  Bernie's lyrics tell a story, and Elton does an outstanding job complementing the lyrics.<br /><br />The last two songs remain among my all-time favorite Elton John songs.  \\"We All Fall in Love Sometimes\\" and \\"Curtains\\" transition from one to the next.  Though the topics are different, the tenor and beauty of the music is common.  When Elton allows his piano to come to the forefront of his music the result is nearly always wondrous.  \\"We All Fall\\" also has one of the best bridges ever performed in an Elton John song.  Elton also plays a harpsichord and a mellotron, used so effectively by the Moody Blues in the previous decade.  The results can only be appreciated by listening.<br /><br />\\"Curtains\\" begins so beautifully that when I am mellow it brings tears to my eyes.  The lyrics are brought to life by Elton's vocal and musical interpretation, striking into your heart and soul.  Only the emotionless could fail to appreciate this fragile, emotional music.<br /><br />This album was the culmination of years of effort.  Themusic is mature and well-crafted.  Beautiful seems a paltry word to describe much of it.  The production was the best ever of any Elton John album to date.  The skill of the art was theirs, and they capitalized on it to create one of the best rock albums of all time.<br /><br />Included on this hybrid SACD are three bonus songs.  \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" was a big hit in 1975 for Elton John and featured the talents of Elton's friend John Lennon.  \\"Philadelphia Freedom\\" was another big Elton John hit, and was written as a tribute.  \\"One Day at a Time\\" is another quite good song that helps fill out the potential time of a CD.<br /><br />Unfortunately I am inadequate for the task of adequately reviewing this CD.  While Elton had many creative moments and beautiful songs prior to this album, and had many other excellent compositions, for one magical album the music, the lyrics, and the production all came together to create an album for all times and all ages.  While I generally feel that people are silly for saying they want to give a CD dozens of stars, this album would rate more than five stars if I could give them.ears of effort.

0316921173|1.0|This was one of the two worst books I've ever read in my life.  I had hoped it might be like \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\" by Umberto Eco (a book I like), as some friend suggested.  But it bore no similarity at all, except in being dense, long, and somewhat difficult to follow.   <br /> <br />I found \\"Infinite Jest\\" to be plotless, self-absorbed, and wallowing in pointless cruelty and hideousness.  It gave me a clear image of the author as being arrogant and self-congratulatory, and completely lacking in any kind of moral or ethical center. <br /> <br />Life is just too short to waste on stuff like this.  I only wish I could get back the time I spent reading this horrible book.  I stuck with it all the way to the end hoping for some sort of payoff, something that would tie it all up and make the experience worth it, but there was nothing.  It just ended. <br />
B000F6XY70|5.0|It may be hard to believe that there were classic family films created in the 60's by anyone other than Disney. This movie is an example of a very good and classic family film, one where the only car chase is after a lion, there are no video games to be seen anywhere, and the central themes of the movie are love and that wild things should live free.<br /><br />This movie is based on a book by Joy Adamson by the same name and chronicles her and her husband's experiences with a trio of lion cubs. Eventually two of the cubs are sent to a zoo, but the third lion, a lioness that Joy calls Elsa, remains with Joy and her husband George. Of course, lions are wild animals and they can live with people for only so long.  Joy is faced with the need to have Elsa sent to a zoo. Joy is unable to think of Elsa being caged when she has been free for her whole life, so she attempts what had not been done before; repatriation of a captive lion back into the wild.<br /><br />Elsa and her husband worked long, hard and with a lot of frustration, despaired that Elsa would never be able to go back to the wild, or that she would die as a result of their attempts. All along the way you can see Joy Adamson's love for Elsa and her need to see Elsa be able to return to the wild.<br /><br />Andy Williams sings \\"Born Free\\" to accompany the end of the movie. This song is one of Andy Williams' best. If you are familiar with this song you will recognize portions of it throughout the movie as a recurring theme.<br /><br />This movie is simple and heart-warming. There are a few moderately violent scenes, but I would consider this movie appropriate for children of all ages, though with parents watching when the youngest family members watch. This kind of movie is rare in any age, and one to be treasured.

0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins, as many of you know who are reading this review, is an evolutionary biologist who has written extensively on evolution, genes, memes, science, and beauty from his perch at Oxford.  The God Delusion is a fantastic (and succinct, for Dawkins) and organized look at why belief in God and belonging to a religion are both outdated and dangerous.  His scientific training gives him authority to talk about science and reason, both of which are flippantly ignored by religion. <br /> <br />While throwing in all kinds of great quotes and historical insights (Thomas Jefferson, Einstein, etc.), Dawkins lists why people believe in God and religion, why they shouldn't believe in God and religion, and how these two issues are actually harmful to our children and society as a whole.  Sam Harris' End of Faith is more pugilistic, but Dawkins writes so compellingly and lucidly about these subjects that I thoroughly enjoyed them both.   <br /> <br />The reader quickly learns that research and historical criticism, when applied to the Christian scriptures, teach us that both the Old and New Testaments are obnoxious propaganda pieces that reflect neither a decent moral code nor any semblance of historical accuracy.  We absolutely don't need religion to teach us how to be ethical and moral, and Dawkins cites studies to show atheists are just as ethical (and maybe more so) as those claiming to believe a mythological bible. <br /> <br />In short--this is vital reading for all of us living in the 21st century.  Following this book's advice could help avert much of the religion-spawned violence we see throughout the world today, and we will all feel so vitalized, honest, and clearheaded when we've thrown away our own personal baggage of God and religion. <br /> <br />
B000BJS4SU|5.0|. . .I am probably the newest passenger on the John Mayer Love Train here. The first song I ever heard was \\"Vultures\\" at 4:00pm the day I saw him in concert that night with Sheryl Crow in Indianapolis, three days before \\"Continuum\\" hit the market. I got to hear him sing it live that night.  While waiting for Continuum to come out, I ordered \\"Try\\" solely to have \\"Vultures,\\"  \\"I Got a Woman,\\" and \\"Good Love is on the Way\\" (I hope he'll release a studio version of this awesome rocker!) to tide me over, so to speak.  But what made me a true believer once I got this thing in my hands was hearing \\"Out of My Mind.\\"  Close your eyes and you'll swear that Ray Charles is singing and Stevie Ray Vaughn is playing the guitar.  But no--apparently this is John's composition, played and sung by John with--dare it I say it?--SOUL.  And it's not even the peak of the concert.  There's lots more to come.  The encore section is 20 minutes long, including a raw rocking version of \\"Something's Missing.\\"  Yes, I have to ignore the sexist lyrics of \\"I Got A Woman\\" and just listen to that blues guitar wail, but after all, he didn't write that one.  Mr. Charles did. There's a lot of variety here--a fun, funky cover of Hendrix' \\"Wait Until Tomorrow\\", \\"Daughters\\" (for those of us who can't get enough of \\"classic John\\"). The \\"green\\" song that follows \\"Out of My Mind\\" reminds me of the Beatles circa 1969.  \\"Vultures\\" rocks, of course--the only thing missing are the keyboard parts from the \\"Continuum\\" version.  I love the way he ends this one--it fades out to him and this little funky rhythmic thing.<br /><br />On a live album, you're either on your game or you're not. Nothing to hid behind.  Nothing to prop you up. And it's just him and two awesome rhythm masters who, like BB King, Clapton, etc., are much too talented and busy to ever suffer fools.  Not that they have to with John. He is ON here. The crowds he played to here were much smaller and quieter than the ones on \\"Any Given Tuesday.\\" There are a few times he's a bit too closer to the microphone, and you'll hear an occasionally appreciative whoop from a fan. But frankly, this captures a lot of what he's really like in concert.  No stupid mouth on this one--he banters with the crowd a little bit, but it's mostly playing and jamming and singing. For the heart and the energy that comes through here, I can put up with a little bit of crowd noise and appreciation.<br /><br />If it's as well-produced as this CD, I'd love to see this on DVD with interviews and a documentary. \\"Continuum\\" will probably sell more units, but for those of us on the Love Train, this album is John's watershed album.  If he goes in this direction in the future, this is the place he began to make grown up music.  I hope his fans will be smart enough to make the journey with him from teen idol to blues master.here are a few times he's a bit too closer to the microphone, and you'll hear an occasionally appreciative whoop from a fan.

B00002Z88D|4.0|Michael Kamen is probably the only orchestral/composer that had the sensibilities to make metal and orchestral blend together. Earlier reviews wish that maybe Horner had taken the reigns. Perhaps this would've been a good idea if Horner could orchestrate or even write original material (witness \\"Willow's Theme\\" and the frightening copy of Schumann's Rhenish Symphony). This album is full of the bombast and pomp that goes along with metal, and the orchestra does a great job in both pushing and keeping up with Metallica. This is not a Best Of in my opinion as there are a few noticeable ommisions from that list, but overall this is a great concept album.
B000GG4KTU|5.0|I put up my 5-star review of this disc in September of 2006, and ran straight into the teeth of the \\"Ammyland Neggie Monsters.\\"  When it got to 3 helpfuls out of 20, I pulled the review.<br /><br />But now that Down Beat has given this disc 4-stars, and Jazz Times' editors have voted it the best vocal jazz c.d. of 2006 (BTW, my vote personally would go to Roberta Gambarini's \\"Easy to Love\\", for what it's worth), I've been vindicated.  I shall forge ahead, assuming that the neggie monsters have crawled back into the cave from whence they came; and if you, dear reader, are reading this review, it's for the right reason:<br /><br />The reasons this c.d. rates this kind of praise are:  1)  Never has Diana Krall sounded better than here.  The flat notes and lack of sparkle that were present in recent earlier discs are gone here.  She even scats a bit and bends some melodies a bit--something I've not heard her done before.  2)  People may think there was no artistic risk involved in a \\"standards singer\\" doing another bunch of standards.  Not so.  Over the past few years, where Ms. Krall has really distinguished herself is on the piano.  In fact, as I noted on \\"The Girl in the Other Room\\", she had gotten to the point where her pianistic chops were significantly outweighing her vocal chops.  These arrangements of the Clayton-Hamilton orchestra, don't give her the space to do any effective pianistic noodling.  She had to carry this off on the strength of her voice.  And she did so.  3)  The album sounds gorgeous.  Al Schmitt is the sound engineer with the golden touch, to be sure; but the arrangements likewise sound splendid.  \\"Day In Day Out\\", in particular, is memorable.<br /><br />Overall, this is Diana Krall's best recording since \\"All For You\\" and \\"Love Scenes.\\"  It's worth owning.<br /><br />Okay, neggie monsters.  I'm ready for you now.  Give it your best shot....RC
B0000CDL3W|5.0|This film is basically a repetition of \\"Terminator 2\\". Two terminators fight over the protection or destruction of John Conner. Only, this time one of the terminators is a female (terminatrix). I perfectly enjoyed the terminatrix character, because she is very sexy. Also, I noticed some similarity to the nuclear threat from the \\"War Games\\" movie.<br /><br />I was hoping that in this episode, the machines will take over the world. I envisioned a post-apocalyptic society where robots dominate over humans and use them as slave labor. But it didn't happen. May be it will happen in a sequel - \\"Terminator 4\\"? Because the final sentences are open-ended: \\"Never stop fighting. The battle has just began\\". Perhaps we (the viewers) should send an letter to Jonathan Mostow and James Cameron, explaining we would like to see in an eventual T4 episode. In my opinion, John Conner's nightmare with the no-skin, skeleton-like terminators should be developed into a full episode, not just briefly flashed for a few seconds in the beginning of the T2 and T3 episodes. I prefer to see robots rather than car chasings. The T3 episode has so many vehicles in it, that the movie feels as if it were \\"Rise of the cars and trucks\\".<br /><br />Other than that, the special effects are dazzling. The female terminatrix is so beautiful, that no matter what she does, she is not scary, but remains rather attractive. And Arnold still looks in excellent shape, I think. The director J. Mostow did a perfect job and you couldn't tell Mostow's episode from Cameron's, if you didn't know ahead of time who was the director.<br /><br />So, this movie deserves a full 5 star rating, and let's hope that the \\"franchise\\" of terminator movies does not end here.<br /><br />P.S. Watch this movie early in the morning, so that in the evening you can sleep well. With so many explosions, shootings and fights, if you see it just before bedtime, it will be hard for you to fall asleep, in my humble opinion.

078322608X|5.0|I always find it fascinating when I see people praising classic films and yet when I watch them, I don't know what the point was. One of those films ended up being Terry Gilliam's Brazil. While visually cool, story-wise it was kind of boring and I didn't really care about the characters which is of course a big no-no. Same with Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas which I watched sober, so maybe that was the big difference. Nearly every weed smoking/beer drinking friend I have in town praises the film. So we come to 12 Monkeys which I liked and it's so far one of my favorites he's done. <br /> <br />It's the year 2035 and 5 billion people died thanks to a virus unleashed by the Army of the 12 Monkeys, a group of people who infected the world in 1996 and 1997. Cole, an inmate \\"volunteers\\" to travel to 1996 to obtain a pure sample since it's long since mutated with hopes of engineering a cure. However they sent him to 1990 and even worse, his rant and ravings about future viruses and mankind's near extinction gets him thrown in the nuthouse. What erupts from there is quite enthralling and will sure keep your brain on their toes...so to speak. <br /> <br />One thing I always love about these kind of films is how certain things in the future get explained such as literal writings on the wall to phone messages and it gets involving mentally, maybe a bit too much so. While I didn't get confused, some scenes will probably just fly over people's heads and leave them disoriented. Especially its ending which I won't spoil and while I did figure it out what it was, other parts I'm like \\"hey wait a minute, what about...?\\" <br /> <br />Bruce Willis, as well as maybe Mark Wahlberg and Orlando Bloom, as what I call the \\"William Hurt\\" factor: no matter how good their performance(or bad in the case of Bloom and occasional Wahlberg), they always sound so BORED. However, this film is arguably one of Bruce's best. Surprisingly it's also one of Brad Pitt's, playing Jeffrey Goines, a man who,as the box puts it mildly, has a few cards short of a full deck. Then there's Madeleine Stowe who I always liked in films she's in but I rarely see her. While there's other actors in the film, such as David Morse and Christopher Plummer, it's primarily these 3 that get center attention. <br /> <br />While I wouldn't necessarily buy 12 Monkeys unless someone bought it for me, it's certainly quite an enjoyable film in its own right.
B00004STPT|5.0|Hans Zimmer has written a lot of music, but this score rises above the rest for me.  Some have complained (and Zimmer has even been sued over it) that this score is too close to some of Holst's \\"The Planets\\", and Mars: Bringer of War certainly influenced parts of this score.  That said, the action music from this score is blood-pumping, and interspersed throughout are gloriously beautiful melodies that inspire the soul and enlighten the mind.  The last 3 tracks are particularly beautiful.  \\"The Battle\\" is the track that recalls \\"Mars\\" (I believe) and is some great action music finished off by the most thematically beautiful music I've heard from Zimmer.  This one is a classic and deserves a place of prominence in even the most basic of film score collections.
0618551050|5.0|The part of the book I found most interesting was the part which tells how the string theorists were scammed by Nature (or Mathematics).  Of course, Smolin doesn't put it exactly like this, but imagine the following conversation.    String theorists: We've got the Standard Model, and it works great, but it doesn't include gravity, and it doesn't explain lots of other stuff, like why all the elementary particles have the masses they do.  We need a new, broader theory.    Nature: Here's a great new theory I can sell you.  It combines quantum field theory and gravity, and there's only one adjustable parameter in it, so all you have to do is find the right value of that parameter, and the Standard Model will pop right out.    String theorists: We'll take it.    String theorists (some time later): Wait a minute, Nature, our new theory won't fit into our driveway.  String theory has ten dimensions, and our driveway only has four.    Nature: I can sell you a Calabi-Yau manifold.  These are really neat gadgets, and they'll fold up string theory into four dimensions, no problem.    String theorists: We'll take one of those as well, please.    Nature: Happy to help.    String theorists (some time later):  Wait a minute, Nature, there's too many different ways to fold our Calabi-Yao manifold up.  And it keeps trying to come unfolded.  And string theory is only compatible with a negative cosmological constant, and we own a positive one.    Nature: No problem.  Just let me tie this Calabi-Yao manifold up with some strings and branes, and maybe a little duct tape, and you'll be all set.    String theorists: But our beautiful new theory is so ugly now!      Nature: Ah! But the Anthropic Principle says that all the best theories are ugly.    String theorists: It does?    Nature: It does.  And once you make it the fashion to be ugly, you'll ensure that other theories will never beat you in beauty contests.    String theorists:  Hooray!  Hooray!  Look at our beautiful new theory.Okay, I've taken a few liberties here.  But according to Smolin's book, string theory did start out looking like a very promising theory.  And, like a scam, as it looks less and less promising, it's hard to resist the temptation to throw good money (or research) after bad in the hope of getting something back for your effort.  One of the questions Smolin addresses in the rest of the book is why the theoretical physics community has kept with string theory and largely abandoned all the other approaches to quantum gravity.  The short answer is that it's hard to admit that you've been scammed.  The long answer is much more complicated.  Another thing Smolin addresses in the book is other approaches to quantum gravity.  And as could be predicted, he gives lots of space to his own approach and too little space to others, especially Alain Connes' non-commutative geometry.  But overall, I found it very worthwhile and entertaining, and a good explanation as to how theoretical physics came to be in the state it is today.
0743454529|1.0|I was curious to read this book because it sounded like an interesting premise for a story, and because I know others who like Picoult's work.  I made it through the whole thing but the ending just made me mad. It was pulled out of nowhere, and I felt that it was melodramatic and manipulative. And despite what seemed to be extensive medical research, there were some flaws here too. The lawyer, Campbell, goes around with a service dog. People keep asking him about it because he is obviously not blind and he makes flippant comments and acts like it is a state secret. Any reader with half a brain would have guessed that he was epileptic. So for him to say he told no one not even his parents (the first seizure was when he was a teenager, discovered after \\"many CT scans\\"--who was supplying his health insurance?) that just seemed ludicrous to me. And for Julia, who is otherwise intelligent, not to guess it is unbelieveable too.  In addition, this guy has a dog because he is having seizures, and yet still drives a car.  Clearly illegal. And he is driving at the end and no one asks that question.  And as for the romance with Julia and Campbell, that was clearly gratuitous, and why I figured Picoult is aiming for a movie on the Lifetime Channel.  That and all the family drama.  Oh yea, and Jesse going around burning buildings for attention when his father is a firefighter. And his father discovers it and just hugs him and that is it--no consequences.  A good idea, gone sadly astray.
B00003CXFV|5.0|This 2000 release stars Julia Roberts and Albert Finney. As much as I enjoyed Pretty Woman, that performance doesn't compare to the excellent work Julia did portraying Erin Brockovich. Years ago, Albert Finney gave an excellent Tom Jones (classic movie, not the singer) portrayal.<br /><br />I'm a paralegal and relate strongly to this movie - all the research and paper processing, the concern for clients, the knuckle-biting waits hoping verdicts are delivered favorably. It's a true story making it even more interesting.<br /><br />Erin is a down-on-her-luck divorced mother of 3, just trying to make ends meet. She has a personal injury case after a vehicular accident, and is represented by the attorney who, after her case is lost at trial, becomes her boss (she kinda forces herself into his payroll). While working at the attorney's office, Erin happens upon the beginnings of a major class action suit against a water company that has been knowingly poisoning the residents of a town with chromium, a rust inhibitor. Nasty stuff, that chromium, when ingested. Will Erin and her boss persevere for their clients?<br /><br />The real-life Erin Brockovich plays a bit part in the movie - she's a waitress at a diner.

0385336691|5.0|\\"The Hard Way,\\" Lee Child's tenth novel in the fantastic Jack Reacher series, breaks absolutely no new ground whatsoever.  Jack Reacher is a character with no surprises whatsoever.  Yet Child continues to throw Reacher pell-mell into some of the most fascinating and lethal adventures imaginable.  This series -- thankfully, Child is working on the 11th book -- continues to set the gold standard for modern thrillers. <br /> <br />The story finds Reacher back in the anonymous beehive of Manhattan.  While contemplating the joys of the city and the rapture of NYC's best cup of coffee, Reacher innocently becomes a witness to a devious kidnapping plot in motion.  Very few things get Reacher's blood boiling, but the story of a kidnapped wife and her eight-year old daughter will do it.  Soon, Reacher is using his brilliant detective's mind and his thundering fists to track down the kidnappers.  <br /> <br />Child uses all his tricks to keep this thriller set just on this side of being plausible.  Red herrings, false leads, and the constant threat of murder keep the reader on edge as the pages fly by.  But the byzantine plot never spins out of control, even though the short chapters are jam-packed with action and suspense.  If you're not a fan of twisted, malevolent villains, hidden motives, quick reversals of fortune, and more than a tad of sex and violence, then the Reacher novels aren't for you.   <br /> <br />If you haven't read any of the Reacher novels, grab the first one, \\"Killing Floor,\\" and get reading!

B00004LN16|2.0|AC/DC is no doubt one of the best rock bands of all time, but they are not growing as musicians. Sure, they can rock like they used too, but they seem to be out of ideas. The well is dry. Put out a anthology already!!! At least my favorite band Deep Purple keep coming up with good stuff, and with imagination! The fact that Purple's music continues to fascinate as well as puzzle after all this time is evidence we are dealing with art of the highest caliber.<br /><br />Anyway, better luck next time Angus & Co.<br /><br />Stiff Upper Lip<br /><br />~ AC/DC : 2 stars
B00005Y6YB|1.0|Hi folks, <br /> <br />Don't  get your pants in a bunch at the low review...its NOT for the movie..its for the appallingly bad DVD.  Grainy and soft...I can't believe they couldn't produce a finer representation of a multi award winning and in general beloved piece of work by all concerned.  This isn't even VHS quality...but then ARTISAN isn't known for  quality... <br />its cheap enough to get anyway and throw away when  a REAL quality version  is released..
B000GFLE1S|5.0|\\"What can I do?\\"  Charlie asks his employee, Lauren, when he's firing her.  \\"The men's shoe market is gone.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Go out and find another market,\\" she tells him.   <br /> <br />And he does.   <br /> <br />At first that market doesn't sit too well with his Northhampton working class employees, but when they realize this is their last hope of keeping their jobs and  the Price Shoe Factory alive, they dig in.   <br /> <br />What are they making?  Kinky Boots---don't think of them as shoes, but as tubes of sex... <br /> <br />And those sexy shoes are for men, women, and folks who haven't made up their minds yet.  Their lead designer is a young drag queen \\"Lola\\" aka Simon, who is still learning who he is as well.   <br /> <br />There are lessons about both life and business in this film.  If I were teaching a management course, I'd be showing this along with the \\"Prince,\\" because \\"Kinky Boots\\" teaches a lot about thinking outside of the box,  engaging your workers, keeping their pride, and finally--doing what you have to do to keep the dream alive.   <br /> <br />I'm glad I purchased this film and will strongly recommend it to friends.
B00001PE4D|3.0|Hmmm...This movie wasn't bad, for a re-make, it had some good elements.  The story line is simple, two stepsiblings (Sarah Michelle Gellar & Ryan Phillippe) figure it would be fun to break someone's heart in a very ominous and impish fashion.  As an incentive, Sarah Michelle Gellar's character offers Ryan Phillippe's character a hot night of sex with her.  Under the assumption that he can find a girl, make her fall in love with him and then break her heart.  This challenge should come very easy to Phillippe's character since he is such a stud.  Now enter the real quagmire, the girl's heart he tries to break is Reese Witherspoon's character.  Consequently, he ends up really falling in love with her.  Very messy.<br /><br />The way I see it, I would have spent my time with Reese, broke her heart and then hooked up with Sarah Michelle, if I was in this movie.  I think many guys would do the same.  However, if I had to choose between Legally Blonde and Buffy the Vampire slayer, then I am going with the Sarah Michelle, she is much hotter and a better actress than Reese's pieces.
B000FQJAIW|2.0|Watching the original versions of the original Star Wars trilogy on DVD is like travelling back in time - not so much to the innocence of youth but more to the days when picture quality was never much of a consideration on video releases and Fox had the reputation for the worst transfers in the business. Watching the new DVD is to step back into an age of low resolution standards conversions with all the loss of detail and motion blurring that that entailed: certainly if you've got one of the old remastered video releases you might as well hold on to that, because the quality isn't as poor as this. The sound quality is pretty awful as well. From Lucas' past track record it's all too easy to imagine this is just a scam to allow him to sell a remastered version a couple of years down the line, but it's even harder to dispel the notion that somewhere Lucas is whining \\"See how soft the focus is? How can you say these are better films?\\" <br /> <br />Although commonly blamed for the death of cinema as we knew it, in truth Star Wars was a huge breath of fresh air after the increasingly stale and formulaic week-in, week-out reality of woefully unimaginative and derivative downbeat on-the-cheap 70s cinema. It wasn't merely a matter of having a happy ending, more that there was a sense of panache and unapologetic adventure that had been missing for too long at the time (even the decade's best adventures, such as The Wind and the Lion and The Man Who Would Be King, saw their heroes destroyed by society in an age that had no place for them). Looking at it for the first time in years, its much better directed than remembered, extremely well constructed and beautifully designed, introducing the `future is old' concept that many would attribute to Ridley Scott. It also, unlike the prequels, has the saving grace of Han Solo, a character whose deprecating sense of humor undercuts the more solemn and potentially pretentious moments in a way that would be much missed amid the talk ofapprentices, trade embargoes and midi-chloridians in the prequels. It's still fun and it still works, even in the very worst transfer of the originals.
0316172324|3.0|After having thoroughly enjoyed Gladwell's 'The Tipping Point', I eagerly awaited for this one to come out.  I must say that I was quite disappointed.  Whereas his first book captivated the reader with engaging ideas of many social phenomenons, this book seemed to lack an identity and purpose.   <br />An extreme viewpoint would be to say that this book was written primarily to ride the wave of the success of the first one.  'Blink' lacks the ingenuity and wit that Gladwell displayed in his first book.
B000002H1T|5.0|Owning every Cars CD and solo recording by this group I feel quite familiar with the Cars music.  I've listened to ALL of them countless times, but always find myself back in \\"Heartbeat City\\".  What a CD!!!! When the album was first released unbeknownst to me I heard Drive and Magic on the radio, and immediately went out and purchased the cassette. To this day the CD still remains in my changer.  This music defined so many things for me back then. I feel this CD helped change the direction on music at the time.   All they're previous releases led up to this.  It was the pinnacle of their music.  Important yet dreamy at times, dark and light, sad yet compelling.  An absolutely fantastic recording that I cannot say enough good things about.  On another note I've listened to the New Cars release that just came out..........Todd is great in his own right but this is nothing more than a $$ scheme.  I can't help but laugh every time I hear his voice on a favorite Cars song.  Give me a break.  Ric, are you listening?  There is one and only will be one \\"Main\\" lead singer for the Cars, ever.
0316926345|4.0|Evelyn Waugh's book \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" gives you that feeling of autumnal-university-literature-class heaviness that you crave from time to time.  Like that piece of chocolate cake that you shyed away from the other day, it's something that is too dense and too heavy for you to eat hurriedly but something that you want to sit and take time with.<br /><br />There are all of the usual literary forms in this book which employs memories of Post-WWI modernist progressivism framed by the mires of WWII meaninglessness.  But Waugh isn't doing this simply for the want of honor and tradition that seem to have been lost to progress and get-'er-done type flunkies, he's (and yes, he is a \\"HE\\") doing it for your soul.<br /><br />Evelyn Waugh was an adult convert to Roman Catholicism, and you can trace both his faith as well the memories of his wrestling against faith in this book.  The book uses the protagonist of Charles Ryder to explore the lives and existential nature of the family that resides in the Brideshead mansion.  It is a look into human nature as it wrestles with all sorts of things, and especially as it wrestles with faith.<br /><br />The book is one of the many that are lumped into the \\"hound of heaven\\" category.  Over and over in the book, we see that no matter how far astray or how morally and ethically objectionable people are - God's grace seeks after them and brings them back with a twitch upon the thread that connects them to God.<br /><br />Although the book isn't overtly Christian, the Christian reader can certainly enjoy a deeper level of significance.  The non-Christian can also enjoy the book, especially the look into the Christian life that shows that even Christians aren't ever perfect, nor do they need to be - they know a hound of heaven who is.
B000G7PMD2|5.0|Score is Dream Theater's 5th live album (the others being, in order, Live at the Marquee, Once in a LIVETime, Live Scenes From New York, and Live at Budokan).  Score is the 20th anniversary concert and the closing concert of their 2005-2006 Octavarium World Tour.  And it is stunning!  First, the band, as always, is in peak form, but the real revelation is James LaBrie and his voice.  For the first time since late 1994, he is completely healed from his vocal cord rupture and is in perfect form throughout the 3 hours of this diverse, grueling, and amazing performance.  His voice is truly another instrument in Dream Theater, one he handles just as virtuoustically as the 4 instrumentalists.  Speaking of them, they are just staggering in their talent and cohesion.  Now, on to the set list....amazing!  After the opening two songs from Octavarium, the band plays a song from each album, chronilogically, to close out the first set.  Included is Another Won, from their Majesty Demos cassette in 1986 and the first song they ever wrote together, Afterlife, an obscure number from their first album, Under a Glass Moon and Innocence Faded (both sound AWESOME and are rarely played live), Raise the Knife, an unreleased studio cut from the Falling Into Infinity sessions that is sensational, and an epic 10 minute version of The Spirit Carries On that has to be the best one they've ever done.    The second set is the real treat, however....done with an orchestra!  They play the ENTIRE 42 minute song Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, which is jaw-dropping, and close out the set with a 28 minute version of Octavarium that is simply mindblowing.  Vacant, Sacrificed Sons, and The Answer Lies Within round out this set, and the encore of Metropolis Pt 1, also done with orchestra, is awesome.    I only have two complaints with this set....one is the sound quality, which is bit muddy from The Root of All Evil until it clears up to perfection around the 3rd song.  The other is, while the orchestra is excellet overall, there are serious tuning problems during the overture part of Six Degrees, and the flutist sounds so nervous that she's going to crash at any moment during her solo in the beginning of Octavarium, which is surprising for a professional musician.  Otherwise this is a stunning document of a band at the continued peak of their powers...here's to 20 more years of DT!!

0393317552|5.0|It's hard to say anything new about a famous book that has been reviewed by many hundreds of people. I won't even pretend I've read all the reviews already posted, which would take hours. But of those I've browsed I have noticed a general trend which I want to counter if I can. It's probably a point that has been made before, even if it was 800 posts ago, but it bears repeating.<br /><br />The key to understanding Guns, Germs, and Steel isn't just a matter of realizing what Diamond argues in favor of (i.e. civil progress is an effect of favorable geography and resource dependency). The key to appreciating the book is understanding what Diamond is trying to build a case against. Many reviewers have stated that Diamond argues against racialist theories of progress, and this is true. He argues you don't need to hypothesize genetic advantages between groups in order to account for how one group may attain superiority over another. Perhaps he's right, but then this argument is not especially novel. Racism and racial theories in the human sciences have been extremely unpopular ever since the fall of colonialism and the ending of WWII. With a few exceptions, (The Bell Curve being a famous example) it's difficult to find recent scholarship in the social sciences that advocates genetic or racialist arguments for progress.<br /><br />What is of more interest, and what I think deserves greater scrutiny is that Diamond gives no support to ANY form of cultural argument. This is notable because cultural, social, and psychological accounts of human progress have been the heavily favored alternative to genetic arguments. Diamond tries to do away with them all. There is no need for Max Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (where America's early religious ethics produce a culture that places an exaggerated premium on work and progress). Diamond's thinking also negates Hegel or any philosophy of history that places importance on singular great individuals who raise, shape, and change the direction of civilizations. Indeed, Hegel, Nietzsche, Marx, Mill, Freud, Darwin and a great many other theorists must be put aside with regard to human progress. What we are left with is a world where human variables matter only on the micro level; not on the macro level. The desire and nature to advance is taken as a constant. It is the natural environment that determines the outcome, and survival of the fittest isn't the issue.<br /><br />I think Diamond makes an excellent case, though hardly flawless, providing a plausible account of how groups could have advanced without regard to their genes, their creeds, or great leaders. You might question why you would want to strip groups of their identity and variability, since in essence Diamond is arguing that one group is as good as the next--all are equally capable. My reading of it is that he takes this approach to avoid the general fogginess that comes from cultural/sociological approaches. In Diamond's theoretical outlook, you need not perform a tribal ethnography to learn why North American Indians weren't prepared for a European invasion. All you really need is to understand the low number of founder crops naturally available to them, the lack of domesticateable work animals, and their comparable isolation geographically.<br /><br />Many reviewers have argued that Diamond ignores human variables. But that is the very point of the book! I agree that Diamond's theory is extremely reductive and he never conclusively makes the case for why it is impossible that cultural factors influence technological advances. What's more, Diamond's more recent book Collapse proposes just the reverse, asserting that societies and groups often choose and pursue the very actions that lead to their destruction. (For example, the natives of Easter Island misguidedly cut down all the trees on their island, ultimately leading to a famine that devastates the population). Together the two books suggest we live in a world where civilizations grow and progress based on environmental circumstances, while on the other hand they fail and collapse based chiefly on their own ineptitude.<br /><br />A last point: when you're talking about a book of this status, you don't necessarily read it because it is essentially correct or even that you believe it to be true. You read it because it provides the best and clearest example of a particularly kind of argument. In this case, its hard to think of another book that lays out the anti-genetic, anti-cultural account of civilization more clearly and successfully than Guns, Germs, and Steel. As philosopher Mortimer Adler used to say, great books are not repositories of truth. You read them to hone your critical thinking, as it's only through critical thought that you can get to any truth whatsoever. You don't need to agree with Diamond to get some value from his book; Guns, Germs, and Steel happens to be an excellent place to exercise your mind.<br /><br />Highly recommended.nd progress based on environmental circumstances, while on the other hand they fail and collapse based chiefly on their own ineptitude.

B00000FZQ8|5.0|While visiting New York City in 1971 with my parents, we stumbled on a sneak preview showing of this movie, in an \\"unholy\\" tandem with some cinematographic disaster titled \\"Hammersmith is out\\" featuring none others than Dame Elizabeth Taylor and Mr. Richard Burton.  <br /> <br />Being only eleven years old at the time, the Taylor/Burton movie didn't appeal to me at all. But Mr. Trumbull's directorial work really touched me: for the first time in my life, I openly wept watching a movie. \\"Silent Running\\" I still find difficult to watch, because after all these years, something is inherently perfect about the last few minutes of this film. By the way, it is through this movie that I later became acquainted, as a professional musician and music educator, with the (now for me) no less remarkable contributions to this beautiful film of Miss Joan Báez and a certain Mr. Peter Schikele, lately of PDQ Bach fame. <br /> <br />I strongly endorse this movie, and nothing would please more than to personally shake Mr. Trumbull's hand and thank him for all his wonderful work in that movie, and in his no less notable later projects.
B000F0UUIM|5.0|I need to preface this review with the comment that I am not a John Wayne fan. However \\"The Searchers\\" is often said to be the Duke's best movie. And it is clear from here that he was no cardboard cut out actor and, if anything, his real talents were underused in his career. Still \\"The Searchers\\" is a classic and deserves to be better known.<br /><br />The 50th anniversary edition is a must for any collector. The restored print for the DVD is excellent. Just what you want to watch John Ford's gorgeous Monument Valley location shots.<br /><br />The \\"extras\\" disk is also excellent. There are three good documentaries all of which were made with thought and genuine concern. A change from all those \\"afterthought\\" DVD extras. One documentary features interviews with Martin Scorsese and another some great shots of the film production camp in Monument Valley in the early 1950s, before it was on the tourist trail.<br /><br />The documentaries would be of interest to serious film students and even amateur sociologists, they illustrate the many serious social issues \\"The Searchers\\" deals with, and takes a serious and humane point of view on, without preaching. A lesson I suppose for today's \\"socially concerned\\" film makers, they really need to focus on the film making and the story first. John Ford did and the message is powerful and still relevant today.

While Gladwell enumerates throughout the book on the point that these decisions are in fact being made averyday he does nothing in the way of teaching the reader how to hone this innate ability to make more accurate judgements.

B00000JCOV|4.0|okay, its obvious, slipknots gimick of the masks and jumpsuits has appealed mainly to little 13 year olds (if you look about 6 or so reviews down you can see theres a bunch of kids writing how they are huge fans.  But, at least in my opinion, slipknot shouldnt appeal to kids at all.  The lyrical content in no one way makes a connection with most 14 year olds  and it would seem they just listen to it to say they are tough and evil.  Same goes for those who listen to death metal to say that it connects with them.  Death metal is amazingly technical music and some of the best muscians in the world are in death metal, i just dont see how people see the lyrical content as connecting with them.  Irrelevant anyways, slipknot is a decent band because its mood music, your pissed off, listen to some slipknot.  Really thats its purpose.  If you want just good hard rock stone sour is probably a better choice.  Wait and Bleed was hailed as the high point of the album, why, because Corey sings on it.  Sublimial Verses was a great improvement over this, but theres a time when Iowa and the self-titled album are a good listen.  get the album, one day youll be in the mood.  But be in that mood, not just in the mood to be a poser.
0743298020|5.0|Summary, no spoilers:<br /><br />Margaret Lea is a reclusive young woman who lives in a room above her father's antiquarian book store. Books are her life, and they have been the one dependable thing that she can rely on to make her feel better.<br /><br />She receives a letter in the mail from Vida Winter, another recluse, who is considered Britain's most successful and prolific writer. Many have attempted to write Vida's biography, but she has consistently given false information about herself.<br /><br />In the letter to Margaret, Vida wants to come clean with her life story - which is full of mystery and tragedy.<br /><br />During the course of this book, we discover why Vida picks Margaret for this task, and why she has decided to do so now.<br /><br />This is a terrific story; full of gothic intrigue and suspense. A lot is mentioned of some of the classic mystery novels involving women, such as The Woman in White and Jane Eyre and Villette. This story by Setterfield fits right in.<br /><br />This book is not without its problems. At points, especially early on, I felt that perhaps the author was trying to hard to fit into that gothic mold, and that the characters sounded false. But this never bothered me enough to make me even think about stopping, and in fact I can say that this is a complete page-turner that was a very enjoyable read.<br /><br />Recommended.

B000059T00|4.0|Blind Faith's self-titled debut would be the one and only release from what many rock fans and music industry insiders believed would be the band to take over where Cream left off. Containing 2/3 of Cream in Ginger Baker and Eric Clapton, the band also featured the talented Steve Winwood, who at age 20 already had made a name for himself with both the Spencer Davis Group and Traffic and had contributed significantly to Jimi Hendrix's Electric Ladyland album. The quartet would be rounded out by the much less famous yet talented bassist Rick Grech. Although one would think that Blind Faith would continue in the heavy blues and psychedelic direction of Cream, the album explored a variety of genres, as though it appeared the band was trying to find their sound. Sadly, just a few months after the album's release, Blind Faith would be no more, making many to wonder what they could have been capable of if they stuck together.<br /><br />The album leads off with \\"Had to Cry Today\\", a hard rocker led by a great guitar riff and Winwood's soaring vocals. Baker's drumming remains as creative as ever, often sounding like a lead instrument. It's also here that you already see Clapton's solos becoming more innovative, developing from the fiery fast licks that he played in Cream to a more distinctive and introspective tone that would define his solo work. The folky \\"Can't Find My Way Home\\" is a classic with another great vocal from Winwood. The band's version of \\"Well All Right\\" is also very good, ending with a short killer jam highlighted by Winwood's fast piano runs. The other classic from this album is the spiritual \\"Presence of the Lord.\\"  A longtime staple on classic rock radio, it remains one of Clapton's finest compositions. Another great song is the underrated \\"Sea Of Joy\\", a haunting track which features strong drumming from Baker and a great violin solo from Grech. The only misstep on the album is the 15-minute \\"Do What You Like.\\" The first 5 ½ minutes are awesome as Winwood lays down a very spooky organ solo while Clapton's slow burning solo is awesome. However, when Grech's bass solo comes in, the track loses all momentum and Baker's long drum solo, impressive as it is, drags on longer than necessary. If both of their solos were shaved down a couple minutes, the track would have worked. All told, while Blind Faith isn't quite on par with the best work of Winwood, Baker, or Clapton, it's a very good album that shows off their remarkable talents.ood lays down a very spooky organ solo while Clapton's slow burning solo is awesome.

B000AADYRQ|4.0|DCFC has really peaked with this one.  A solid performance through and through, this one is more enjoyable from start to finish than their last album was.  They received a lot of radio airplay for a couple of the songs off of this one and it was well-deserved as they finally received national attention.

B00006LLOG|4.0|Lou Reed would release his second solo album, Transformer, in 1972. At the time, he had yet to achieve commercial success as his self-titled debut album had bombed and his four albums with the Velvet Underground, as great as they were, had yet to achieve the critical acclaim they would deserve over time. David Bowie was brought in to produce the album, adding a glam-rock feel to Reed's tougher street smart sound. This, along with a strong set of songs, would give Reed his greatest commercial success with Transformer and also give him his lone Top 20 hit in \\"Walk on the Wild Side.\\" Although Reed would release better albums than this in the future, Berlin and New York being two of them, neither of them would reach the masses like Transformer.<br /><br />While Transformer does possess a glam feel in both its lyrics and music, the tracks that deviate from that formula are the ones that work best. The big hit \\"Walk on the Wildside\\", one of the most controversial songs to get played on AM radio, shows Reed's tale of decadence complemented by a cool jazz bass line, female doo wop vocals straight out of the 50's, and a great sax solo at its closing. The excellent \\"Satellite of Love\\", \\"New York Telephone Conversation\\", and \\"Andy's Chest\\" continue the `50s tradition with both their vocals and arrangements. Reed also visits his roots with \\"Vicious\\", a wicked track that sounds like something from the Loaded album only harder. The beautiful \\"Perfect Day\\" and the risqu&eacute; \\"Make Up\\" would also reveal the more grandiose arrangements that would come on his next album, Berlin. The glam rock songs \\"Hangin' Round\\", \\"Wagon Wheel\\", and \\"I'm So Free\\" are all decent but aren't as strong lyrically or musically as the rest of the album. The closing track is a jazzy take of \\"Goodnight Ladies\\" that is actually pretty cool. All told, while Transformer isn't Lou Reed's best album, it's still very good and a newcomer to his solo material should start here since this is certainly his most accessible work.ble work.  <br />
1401302378|5.0|Does the modern world of online markets make you feel like Rip Van Winkle, who awoke from a 20-year nap to find a changed society? Author Chris Anderson has your wake-up call. With hard facts, charts and numbers, plus futuristic insights, Anderson decodes the mysteries of online marketing, Internet-based commerce and other New Age economic realities. His calculations, public feedback and extensive research offer more than just statistics for the sake of proving his point: Online retailing has a long reach into niche markets. This gives its products longevity that stores with finite shelf space can't match, no matter how much steam they get from short-lived, blockbuster products. Anderson credibly explains the decline in box office sales and the rise of niche companies such as Netflix and iTunes. Despite a few redundancies (he believes in thorough explanations), keep on reading. You won't mind: the text is a pleasure, written with wit, style and expertise. We recommend it to Luddites, old school business operators, anyone in entertainment or retail, and New Age Internet-based marketers (although you probably already know just how long this tail can be).
B000060MMI|5.0|I never really was into punk music too much. I thought it was too much screaming, and not enough instrumentation. THen, I discovered Flogging Molly, one of the greatest things to ever happen. I listened to Drunken Lullabies, and was immedietely hooked on this band. THis is an amazing CD that truly deserves recognition. This was the first Flogging Molly CD I listened to, and got me completely hooked on this Irish/Folksy punk band. <br />Track by Track: <br />1. \\"Drunken Lullabies\\": Brilliant opening, with a cool sounding banjo in the beginning, an awesome fiddle, and some great lyrics. 10/10 <br />2. \\"Whats Left of the Flag\\": Another awesome song, with even better lyrics than drunken lullabies. Its not as catchy musically, but only barely so. Many consider this one of their best because of its bitter lyrics. Again, a great violin, and some really good singing. 9.5/10 <br />3. \\"May the living be dead in our wake\\": Its similar sounding to the first two, except instead of a violin, there's a flute, which makes an awesome sound. Its still fast paced and upbeat, but more soothing than the first two songs. 9/10 <br />4. \\"If I ever leave this world alive\\": A slow ballad that is remarkably well done. After three fast songs, it may not seem as good, but give this song some time, and you'll enjoy it. The singing is excellent here, showing Dave King's vocal power and range. 8/10 <br />5. \\"The Kilburn High Road\\": Again, another fast paced one with a killer guitar solo, and another flute. Similar sounding to \\"May the living...\\" with a VERY catchy chorus that I always find myself singing. 9/10 <br />6. \\"Rebels of a sacred heart\\": This is a different style song. It has a slow opening that may sound not so good, but it has an intensely catchy chorus, and if you give it several listens, it is excellent. Its long, but definetely a brilliant addition. 9/10 <br />7. \\"Swagger\\": One of the weaker songs of the album. It is completely instrumental, with only one line that means nothing. However cool the melody is, its too repetitive to be good. THe guitar is a treat here, but again, too repetitive. Luckily its short. 6/10 <br />8. \\"Cruel Mistress\\": There's a change of singers here, but the song is still instrumentally amazing. I don't care much for the bass player singing, I think Dave King is a lot better, but this guy provides a more sinister and evil sort of sound, and the whole songs sounds very pirate like and kind of catchy. Its not the best, but still pretty well done. 7.5/10 <br />9. \\"Death Valley Queen\\": This is one of my personal favorites. The violin is very well done here, and despite the fact that its a slow song, which may turn people away, the lyrics are extraordinary, about a lost love. I love this song. 9/10 <br />10. \\"Another Bag of Bricks\\": THis one sounds arabian and asian with the accordian opening it, and is different and cool. Dave King has a more sinister tone in his voice, it kind of reminds me of \\"Cruel MIstress\\". Its better though, and certainly a break from the style of the first three songs. Again, its good, but not excellent. 8/10 <br />11. \\"The Rare Ould Times\\": Many consider this song filler, but I love the chorus. The singing/lyrics here are great, although there's not too much in the melody. Like \\"Cruel MIstress\\", its good, but not great. 7.5/10 <br />12. \\"The Son Never Shines\\": THis is a ballad, and personally, I don't like it. Its too slow, and rather boring. THe singing is good, but the melody, instrumentation is too boring for me. Overall, a weak finish. 5/10. <br /> <br />However, despite a couple blemishes (The Son Never Shines, Swagger) this album is amazing. Definetely, if you like music with great melodies, and yet still a upbeat feel, this is a brilliant album.
B000GRUMQ4|3.0|Wolfgang Peterson has finally returned to his claustrophobic, watery roots with a remake of The Poseidon Adventure.  Carnage abounds after a rogue wave upends the vessel, and passengers are variously drowned, crushed, fall, burned, and electrocuted.  The cast is a good mix of veterans and newcomers like any good football team, with Kurt Russel at the helm, taking the likes of Josh Lucas and Jacinda Barret under his wing.  This is a great example of the disaster genre, with plenty of good-looking CGI and big-bang pyrotechnics.  Also, Kurt Russel pulls off the best piece of acting in his long career, a particularly good drowning.
B0000542D2|1.0|Back in Mid-November of 2005, I tried to buy this title and for some odd reason the computer/router whatever it was wasn't able to find my address and ended up not sending me a copy though I can't complain because I did get my money back. It's puzzling to have this kind of experience. I wasn't foreign to buying things from Amazon. But now after reading several reviews I guess I should be grateful not to get one because it sounds like this particular package might be a total waste of time and money.  I love the Beatles for many reason but I'm not likely to pay 60 bucks on Ebay for the special MPI version. I might however wait for a better version that is sold at a reasonable price if Miramax or whatever studio decides to re-release A Hard Day's Night on DVD. <br /> <br />I hope this is helpful or atleast inciteful.
0634089358|5.0|This bass blues book is excellent. Why? Because it has a great variety of styles-from Chicago to New Orleans to Texas blues! And the CD makes it even better. It also has more than several variations for most of the examples, great slow blues, and great blues classics. Also included are variations for endings and turnarounds. There are 43 examples on the CD, covering the good ol' blues up into more rock blues. There is a great version of \\"Stormy Monday\\" on this that I just play the heck out of! This is certainly a HIGHSIERRABASSPLAYER must buy! Thanks Ed!
B000H0MKGK|1.0|John Mayers first two cd's, were great, some of the best music I've heard in a very long time.  This CD was awful.  John, you're not an R&B singer like Al Green, Sam Cook, etc.  Stick to the rock/pop.  It's alright to have a touch of R&B/Blues, but stick to what you do best.   <br /> <br />With the exception of track #6, this album was a total waste of money.  Buy it used!!
B000002P2V|5.0|This is one of the first Who albums I ever bought and it holds a special place in my mind.<br /><br />Not every song is great but 'Who Are You' is arguably the best song they ever recorded.
B000G759LW|4.0|\\"Back to Basics\\" shows a more mature and grown-up side to Christins Aguilera's music. This album is full of songs that are related to past issues she has had to deal with or showing how her future is better and how she is happy with her marriage and her husband.  <br />  With songs titled, \\" Ain't no Other Man\\" and \\" Without You\\", she is letting the world know she loves her husband, but she also has songs that deal with more unpleasant issues such as childhood abuse,\\"Oh Mother\\", and an absentee father,\\"The Right Man\\". You can really feel all the emotion that was put into writing these songs.  <br />  She uses her third album as a way to lose some of her X-tina image and show a more mature attitude and sound. She has left the explicit lyrics and gone to a sound that includes old horn sounds and blues sounds come straight out of the history of blues. With these sounds she is able to show off her extreme vocal range and abilities. <br />  Christina can no longer be compared to the pop divas like Jessica Simpson and Brittany Spears. She has her own sound that leaves them behind. She really lets her music show her feelings and attitude and does not cover it up with DJ effects and remixes.  <br /> The first release, \\"Ain't no Other Man\\", starts off with the old unretouched horn sounds of a New Orleans Jazz Band and goes straight into a song that not only shows off her trademark vocal abilities, but is also a definite head-bobber while in the car.  <br /> This album is not only a step up from her previous releases, it is a step up for her personally and should be enjoyed by all who appreciate good music and want to be able to dance and enjoy themselves while listening to it. <br />
0767834739|4.0|While I love that they are doing movies for the Resident Evil, and that they have chosen Milla Jovovich I was left slightly unsatisfied with this movie. I saw the first one and completely enjoyed it from start to finish. With this one I wasn't sure if they were trying to not spend as much money and give a few cheap shots during the action. I am not sure if anyone else notices the changes in the lens in way like what was done in moments in Collateral damage. If you wish to explain why they do this by all means please write me a comment. Where the action was done with normal shots I enjoyed each and every stunt, shot, and explosion. Overall the acting was decent just what is needed in an action movie, but all I have to do is remind myself that I am not watching it for academy preformances. Overall I did enjoy the movie even with my personal annoyance at the shots, I was glad about the stunning ending that they left us with. one more important note I left in my head as I watched the movie, a note that everyone should leave in their head... that in a series the second movie is the bridge between the first movie to the third one so basically go easier on it, it did it's job succesfully and I will be going to the theatres once again to see the third and adding to my shelf once it is released.
B000075BFK|4.0|Well, R U Still Down? was with no doubt Pac's best album released after his death. So Better Dayz must the second best. After Tupac's most unfortunate death there have been poultry albums released (Loyal To The Game and Until The End Of Time) which both are fiddled with terribly. These tracks are all great, they were unreleased tracks from Pac's Deathrow era and he made alot of tracks on Deathrow seeing he somehow could see his death coming. The way I see it, these are all perfectly good Pac tracks and Pac fans certainly should get this. Though of course it is in no way anything in comparison to the legendary albums made while he was alive. Looking at the content of the album. There are real Pac classics like Still Ballin, When We Ride On Our Enemies, Mama's Just A Little Girl, Thugz Mansion, My Block, F*** Em All and more. Also there are no tracks that suffer from poor production, all the beats are great. Deserves the 4 stars I gave it. If you liked this than also get -  <br />-2pacalypse Now <br />-Strictly For My N.I.G.G.A.Z. <br />-Thug Life Volume 1 <br />-Me Against The World <br />-All Eyez On Me <br />-The Don Killuminati 7 Day Theory <br />-R U Still Down? (Remember Me?) <br />-Greatest Hits <br /> <br />
B0002858YS|3.0|I loved the style of The Killers ever since I was first introduced to their hit song \\"Somebody Told Me.\\" The vibe that the group gave off, uniquely combine rock with a techno-ish feel to it, so not only could you rock out to it and bang your head but you could also put it on at a dance party and get down to it.  <br />What sets this group apart from most rock groups is that their lyrics are great and seem to have meaning. The first three songs on this album all seem to have a sad message in them even though their tunes would suggest otherwise. My true dissapointment for this cd is that I only enjoyed the first four songs, and no matter how many times I listen to the others they just seem to blend together. Perhaps the other just feel short to how much better the first frour were. While cd may not have been best all the way through... there was a review written by *miss independent* for \\"The Deluxe Tour Edition\\" of this same album which includes videos and more songs. After reading the review I immediately wished I had bought that edition rather, the the normal one. So if your a real rock fan, spend the extra bucks on one of the more advanced editions of this cd.

B000H7JCG4|2.0|This is for the person who wondered if the <br />orginal music would be used. Sorry to be  <br />the one to post this, but no it will not. <br />They hired a composer to compose new music. <br />It is because of music rights. It would <br />have drove up the price of the DVD.  <br />They might use the orginal music here <br />and there but for the most part it will <br />not be the same. I Rated it 2 Stars <br />only because of the different music.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Interesting reading the various blogs on this group.  The fact that there are close to 1000 opinions means something.  These dudes get reactions, good or bad.  After seeing them live last week (a must have), decided to reacquaint myself with their previous stuff.....No, it is not the same, yes, it is Tool.....they do have a style.....Bottom line,  power and brilliance....with more talent than anyone else I can think of....
B000DWMN2S|3.0|I enjoyed this movie for what it was - mildly entertaining and aesthetically pleasing.  However, it bears so little resemblance to Jonathon Safran Foer's novel that Foer fans will be likely disappointed.  The ending was completely altered and characters changed to such an extent that the movie can only be called an adaptation of the novel in the loosest of terms.  Without the back story interwoven, the plot is thin, illogical, and at times, difficult to follow.  I would be interested to see Foer's own reaction to the film; personally, if someone shredded apart my critically aclaimed novel in order to tack on a vague feel-good message, I'd be livid!
B000J0PEPW|4.0|While this movie will not win any Oscar's, it is a great horror romp. It is better than the Exorcism movies lately, such as 'The Exorcism, The Begining'. This movie is based on a true story. With Hollywood facts and fun added. If you like a movie with little gore and lots of creepy fun, then this title is for you! Perfect for the Horror/Ghost Story collection.
0790734850|5.0|L.A. Confidential is a phenomenal film.  Originally overshadowed by Titanic, it has come to be appreciated as a modern classic. <br /> <br />The film follows three police officers, Bud White (Russell Crowe), Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce) and Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey)as they investigate a mass murder and become caught up in the events unraveling around them.  All three actors give fine, nuanced performances of deeply flawed men.  Pearce is the film's surprise--his subtle performance gives Exley depth beyond what is scripted, and we see his character grow over the course of the movie.  As Exley struggles to define himself and his beliefs, we are left wondering what direction his character will take, right to the end of the film when Exley faces a moral choice and must decide who he is. <br /> <br />Great screenplay, music, direction--L.A. Confidential is as perfect as any film can be.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Set two years after the conclusion of the FF VII console game, this story picks up when a new disease, Geostigma, seems to be infecting the world.  Most believe that it is further proof that the world has rejected humanity.  Cloud Strife, the conflicted hero of the original game has chosen to live a solitary life, unwilling to take action because of his part in the tragic events of the game.  But an attack as he returns to Midgard, and pressure from such disparate folks as Tifa Lockhart and Rufus Shinra, begins to draw him out of his shell.  Three brothers Kadaj, Yazoo, and Loz are searching for 'mother,' the remains of Jenova, the alien life form that nearly destroyed the planet, in order to resurrect Sephiroth.  When they kidnap the children of Midgard to further their aims, Cloud goes into action.  Still fighting his own internal battles the ex-SOLDIER pitches in with a vengeance, sensing that this is his last opportunity for healing.<br /><br />That, and about an hour of running battles is the plot of the film.  More than enough, by the way, to give every Final Fantasy fan in the universe a hundred minutes of fun, thrills, and even a few carefully hidden tears.  I would never have expected that a CGI recreation of what was one of the best of the games to be even better than the game it was modeled upon.  Directors Tetsuya Nomura and Takeshi Nozue are geniuses, plain and simple.  The graphics are pure Final Fantasy, but rather than push for hyper-detailed style that CGI often uses, the film maintains a slightly soft focus and pays great care to the naturalness and expressiveness of the characters.  Except when they are leaping and racing about during fights.  In the latter case prepare yourself from some truly delightful choreography.  So what, after all, if Cloud gets boosted a couple thousand feet in the air in a blazing example of teamwork, it's great to watch him take a the monster apart.<br /><br />A big surprise is the acting.  Both the Japanese version and the English dubbing are excellent.  I experienced no disconnect whatever between what I expected the characters to sound like and what they did sound like.  This, coupled with the fluid animation, creates an unusual level of realism.  The music was 'good enough' but not up to the par of the rest of the production.  For an interesting insight in how far animation has come take a look at the excerpts from the original game.  FF VII was the first games to start setting the bar for console games, but there is still a long way to go before FF X or the soon to be released FF XII.  Yet it's impossible to deny the playability of the game itsel, and this film proves that even an old story can wear new clothes.and the English dubbing are excellent.

B000E6UK5K|4.0|\\"On An Island\\" is a good album, and contains some of David's finest guitar playing.  Yes, it is very mellow, but then again a lot of Pink Floyd's music was quite  mellow as well.  I really dont understand all these reviewers complaining about how David can't rock out anymore and what not.  I never really considered Pink Floyd \\"rockers\\" anyway, their music was much too nuanced to be called ROCK.  All of you Floyd Heads that hate anything that doesnt have Roger Water's depressing ranting attached to it should just go back and listen to \\"The Wall\\" or \\"The Final Cut\\" some more. I have been a Floyd fan for over thirty years, by the way.  It just seems some people always have to attack Gilmour's lyrics and try to compare them to Waters'.  OK, Roger is a better lyricist, but David IS the sound of (classic)Pink Floyd, the voice and the guitar.   <br /> <br />And on this album, David's voice and guitar sound as great as ever.  His guitar solo at the end of the title track is one of his best, it is so filled with emotion that it gives me goosebumps.  I think it can rival \\"Comfortably Numb\\" as the best Gilmour solo of all time.  As a guitarist myself, I can only hope to be this expressive on my instrument, and this is why David Gilmour is so highly regarded as a guitarist, he totally epitomizes the less is more approach to lead guitar.  When guitarists talk shop about \\"ultimate Strat tone\\", they are usually referring to Mr. Gilmour.  <br /> <br />Yes, there are a few throw away tracks on this album.  In my opinion the strongest tracks are \\"On An Island\\", \\"The Blue\\" and \\"Smile\\".  This is not a ROCK album.  It is not a PINK FLOYD album, although parts of it will remind you of \\"Meddle\\" era Floyd.  But it IS quality music made by a superb musician, and anyone who says it isn't is either a) not a musician, or b) a very narrow minded one.  Give it a chance, and it will grow on you.
B000AWYOGE|3.0|Once again displaying a wonderfully waifish look and a convincingly helpless manner, Jennifer Connelly is the perfect actress for a paranoia suspense-thriller, yet \\"Dark Water\\", from a Japanese novel and film, ultimately bites off more than it can chew. Young mother (about to be divorced from her fed-up husband) moves into a spooky apartment complex on Roosevelt Island across the Manhattan River; she's plagued by headaches and childhood traumas regarding her mother, but she gets her kid into a great school and finds a job on her very first interview (!). Bringing in a story thread about a little girl who lived in the apartment upstairs eventually consumes the proceedings, turning the narrative completely away from tenement-terrors and into a shaggy dog murder mystery. The DVD extras are full of the usual self-congratulations; what the filmmakers really need to do on bonuses like these is to reflect a little on what went wrong instead of applauding eachother ad nauseum. B-
B000001E3L|5.0|Sorry \\"I'm not impressed\\" but you clearly missed the boat of your review. I sugguest you LISTEN to the audience reaction to Vans performance that night. He was truely brilliant and this is one of the \\"live\\" CDs ever. Van does not have to reinvent himself into anything. He's already a great singer, songwriter and performer and if some people can not see this I truly pitty them. His back-up band is session-quality, they're that good! Been listening the greatness of VM since I first saw him on ABC's In Concert in 1974. To those out there on the fence about this CD I say buy it and enjoy it. Good luck finding it however, it's out of print.
0393324818|5.0|How is it that the Oakland A's have won the AL West in 2000, 2002, 2003 (and are all but assured of winning this year, 2006), as well as the wild card in 2001, even though they are in the bottom third of all major league baseball teams in total payroll?  That is the narrative that Michael Lewis uses to tell the story of his book Moneyball.  One of the central tenets of Moneyball is that there are objective statistics that although often ignored and undervalued, can, with some specificity, predict certain players' performances in certain areas.  It is, however, only half the story, and as your rotisserie league friends will no doubt tell you, old news.  The real story that Moneyball drives home is the challenge in getting people who actually make the decisions about the baseball teams to listen up.  Lewis repeatedly describes how the Old Boys Club of major league owners (who Lewis affectionately refers to as The Women's Auxiliary), players, and journalists (former Cincinnati Red and current ESPN commentator Joe Morgan is appropriately skewered) reject this statistical approach that has sometimes been referred to as sabermetrics and the teachings of sabermetricians like Billy Beane (the book's main protagonist and current A's GM), Bill James, Dick Cramer, and others.  And on the Old Boys Club the point is lost: that objective statistics have the potential to give small-market teams who cannot afford to compete financially with larger market teams for key players, the best chance of winning.  When people point to the fact that the A's have not won the World Series since 1989 in spite their almost unparalleled success over the past eight years (roughly since 1999) is when Moneyball makes its point.
B000H305U0|1.0|Ok, im not a Justin Hater so the low \\"rating\\" is in part because i feel the alubm has amazing AMAZING beats but as far as writting, this cd lacks so much!  The Writing is plain, unpleasant and at times boring.  The cd get very repetative and i found myself listening to this cd less and less this week. (wierd since ive only had for a week)  I feel that justing previous work was much more impressive however if you like \\"Sexy Back\\" and \\"My Love\\" then you will be dissapointed because the albums has nothing to offer but repetition and great beats.  I only wish this cd was sold as an instrumental, not with Justin's ironic, childish, and unflattering voice.
0380799006|5.0|I read this book in 1992.  At the time, I was the mother of a seven-year-old girl and a five-year-old girl.  I began applying the lessons immediately.  Now twenty-one and ninteen, my daughters describe us as one of the few families they know where the kids are truly friends.  This is very different from my own childhood experience.  My children had conflict growing up but I learned how to help them learn to resolve it in a positive way, thereby dramatically reducing the stress in our home.  I also saw my kids use the techniques with their relationships with friends!  I also have a twelve-year-old daughter and eleven-year-old son that get along really well, even learning to share the television and computer, so it's not just luck with the older ones.  I now routinely give this book as a gift to parents of a second or third child.  I HIGHLY recommend this to parents of children of any age.
B000EQH2QK|5.0|When i first purchased Shakira's Oral Fixation vol. 2, i was of course skeptical about what i was getting myself into.  I purchased Laundry Service back in 2001 so i was hoping to hear a continuation of Laundry Service.  Boy was i wrong and i must say, im glad i am.  Laundry Service was an overall adequate listen, nothing memorable besides Whenever Wherever and Underneath your clothes.  The first song of VOL. 2, \\"How Do You do\\" is so great!  The raw beauty that comes out of this womans voice is just compeling yet at times i find myself wishing i could understand some of the stuff she says. I find her pronunciation confussing and tiring at times but with repeated listens to the entire album, i have found that it takes some getting used to.  Once you get over the fact that Shakira's voice is unusual, you will see that her voice is a wonderful passionate instrument on its own.  <br /> <br />Standout Tracks are: <br /> <br />How do you do - This song is so beautiful, it has this spiritual vibe so compeling and so rythmic, i love jamming this one! Great Beat <br /> <br />Illegal - Carlos Santana with his guitar riff? Come on!  The song is simple, satisfying and has a great melody, so relaxing <br /> <br />Don't Bother - The Reason i Bought the album in 2005.  Ladies and even men can relate to a song about an ex and how he/she has left you for someone better, physically \\"far better than me.\\"  <br /> <br />Dreams for Plans - Something about this song just soothes and makes you just feel at ease and its hard to put a word to it.  It has a country sound however it has more rock and roll element with a touch of pop and jazz. <br /> <br />Hip's Don't Lie - Ok, im not the biggest fan of this song but it sure is a great song.   Great song to dance to, and a great fun track, nothing artistically endeavouring here, just pure musical fun.
B00005RYL2|4.0|There are 4 Highlander Films and this one, is the absolutely best one.  <br />It is a strong story about immortals that have to defeat each other so they can have \\"the price\\", and the only way to kill each other is to chop of each other's head.  <br />Now the best element of this film is that it's not just about immortals trying to chop each other heads off.  <br />Yes, the beautiful thing of this film is that besides the action and thrills, there is the emotion that the immortals have of having to live forever. Friendship, love, it's all made more dificult because of being immortal in a world where everybody else is mortal. This emotion and feeling is shown perfectly.  <br /> <br />Highlander has next to a strong story, a strong cast.  <br />The main character we are following through his life is played by Christopher Lambert, who does a good job portraying the hero of the film. He is helped by Sean Connery's character, who is cast as a Spanish lord (which is a pretty weird casting choice considering Sean Connery is Scottish). But although he is a Spanish Lord with a Scottish accent, it doesn't ruin the fun one bit. Clancy Brown plays one of the best bad guys I've every seen on the screen. He is evil, not merifull and absolutely bad. he also looks the part perfectly, and is frightin gwith his dark voice. Great casting choice.  <br /> <br />The locations are great (the movie set in the ancient Scottland and the New York of the 80's, but also at some other great sets), the fightscenes thrilling (Swordfighting with great special effects), the editing of the film has some of the greatest editing moments ever and the music is absolutely right. Michael Kamen has made a great soundtrack for the film. Also, a lot of songs from the famous Queen are in this film. Trust me, seeying an immortal struggle with his being immortal while \\"Who wants to live forever\\" is played is one of the strongest moviemoments ever that gives you chills over your spine.  <br /> <br />So if you want to see a Highlander film: be sure to do it right and watch this one. The others are way weaker than this strong original. It is a perfect thrilling adventure that you will remember and want to watch again. Highlander is enjoyable for 1 viewing, but also for 5 viewings more. You just want to see it again and again. <br /> <br />Enjoy! <br /> <br />
0393317552|5.0|\\"By contrast, civilisations in tropical regions had ready access to abundant foodstuffs that could grow easily in such a warm climate. Tribes of native North Americans ranged over land that is now considered the most fertile in the world - and yet, none of these civilisations, despite their favourable geography, progressed as European nations did.\\"     -- From one of the current \\"Spotlight Reviewers\\"    Wow.    So, I've just finished reading Guns, Germs and Steel, which seems to give me a bit of an advantage over the current so-called \\"Spotlight Reviewers\\" because, based on the content of their reviews, they haven't read it.    For instance, the above argument seems to ignore the fact that this point is addressed, at length, by Mr. Diamond over the course of his book. In fact, it's one of the central points to Guns, Germs and Steel--explaining why Native Americans had this awesome soil but didn't develop the same agriculture that Europeans did. (His answer? Because while they had the right growing environment, they didn't have the right crops for it 'till they were imported from Europe. It's argued with facts and evidence and such, and argued pretty well.) Either that reviewer didn't read the thing, didn't understand it or is being intentionally deceptive.    Or, consider this (from the other \\"Spotlight Reviewer\\"):    \\"Diamond states that 'those four sets of factors [above] constitute big environmental differences that can be quantified objectively and that are not subject to dispute.' Fair enough, but what *is* subject to dispute is that there might be some other factors at work. Thomas Sowell in Race and Culture does a good job of developing the thesis that the exchange of information among European cultures, facilitated by Europe's plentiful navigable rivers, was the key to Europe's technological and economic rise. David Landes in the Wealth and Poverty of Nations attributes China's conscious decision in the 1400's to isolate itself form other nations as the keyevent (decision) that caused it to lose it's technological advantage and fall behind Europe. (Diamond briefly touches on 15th Century China in the final chapter, but manages to boil this as well down to an accident of geography.)\\"    Yes--Diamond talks about China's isolationism... and he uses it as a key example of something that was *not* determined by geography. What he says, rather, was that it was geography which allowed China to be unified and that this unification meant that things such as political policy were much more powerful there than in Europe, because European geography conspired to keep people from being unified politically. He makes the point that no single politician in Europe could have made the decision to be \\"isolationist\\" like they did in China, because there were too many competing societies in Europe.    Also? Diamond talks about the ease of exchange of infomation/technological diffusion though this reviewer suggests that the topic is ignored in this book. In fact, it's one of Diamond's central points. Only someone who didn't bother to read the whole thing before writing his review could have missed that.    I suppose that this is why Pulitzer Prizes aren't generally given to website reviewers.    I could go on in addressing these two reviews directly, and I'm sorely tempted to, but you know something...? I'm not sure it's appropriate. Everyone's review of this book seems to be their opinion of the theory presented in the book, and I'm not sure that's fair to the author or to potential readers. After all, large theories like this (concerning all of pre-history and human socieites) can't either be expressed or dismissed in a few paragraphs; that's why Diamond wrote the 400+ pager that he did. Instead, let me talk a bit about some other issues that prospective readers might be interested in:    Diamond writes clearly, and the layman will readily understand. His tone is scholarly, but he is never too academic or wordy. He is, perhaps, a bit repetitive as he reiterates the basic ideas behind his thesis several times (though the repetition does help to re-enforce these ideas and some will find that helpful). Fans of early history and sociology might find this book fascinating, but it *is* a history text, so those who didn't like such in school should probably steer clear.    I was worried, going in, that Diamond might have a bit too-much of an anti-European/anti-Caucasian bias going in, as his topic does tend to lend itself to such things. I'm especially sensitive to that sort of thing, as I was one of the only conservative students on the campus of UC Santa Cruz, a school that makes UC Berkeley look like a Klan meeting. You know what, though? Other than one or two questionable sentences near the very beginning (like his suspicions that New Guineans are more intelligent, on average, than Europeans), Diamond simply has a clinical, balanced approach to everyone and everything. He comes across as fair-minded and well-researched.    I'm an odd duck in that I enjoy ideas and history texts, but I had a lot of fun reading this book. If you like the same things as I do, then I recommend it to you as well. For fans of history, etc., five stars.    As to the other stuff, like: is Diamond's thesis--that the fate of societies was dependent on their initial geography--correct? I have to leave that to the reader, because Diamond develops it by writing a book and I think that to be fair to him, people should read it before making up their minds as to whether he's wrong or not. Sadly, the \\"Spotlight Reviewers\\" do not seem to have given him that courtesy. I will say that, to my mind, Diamond's thesis is well-argued, clear and compelling. While it is possible that he has over-stressed the elements that make up his personal thesis and downplayed some others, I tend to believe that this is what people do when they write books attempting to explain phenomena. It's a no-brainer that people need to get information from more than one source and perspective in order to come to grips with such deep topics as world history. But in terms of expressing his point of view (\\"environmental determinism\\") and expressing it well? Guns, Germs and Steel is a classic and well-worth the accolades that folks have given it.     Excellent book: read it and decide for yourself.
074322454X|4.0|With the exception of Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon, which is fiction, I've never read a book on World War II before. And aside from my interest in Cold War/atomic culture, war isn't normally on my bookshelves. But after seeing a couple of the final episodes on repeat on the History Channel of \\"Band of Brothers,\\" the miniseries based on this book, I gave it a go. <br /> <br />Rather fascinating go it was, too. We follow the famous 101st Airborne's Easy Company from training to shortly after the war. But what we follow is not so much the events, but the people who trained, fought and were shaped by events greater than the whole. Band of Brothers gives war not just a face, but a whole company's face, and we move through the latter stages of World War II through their eyes. Ambrose's prose is as effective as the memories of those men of Easy Company who lived to tell the tale.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This is the real thing. He is the real thing. Very original and that is quite clear no from this CD. What were some people thinking? Good show John!
B000777J2S|3.0|i think the reason that most are giving this 1 star (which it certainly does NOT deserve) is b/c of the obvious GBLT references / support; open up the CD flap, listen to the lyrics of select songs, and its obvious; top it off with a very high pitched man's voice as the primary vocals and those he-men types will go running. <br /> <br />shame they're so insecure. there's about 5 terrific songs on this record: \\"i am a buoy\\" is a terrific song, as is \\"spiralling\\" and \\"my lady story\\".  <br /> <br />granted, if you don't like the genre, you probably won't like it at all. but this album / artist is not as bad, or as terrific, as the reviews would lead you to belive. however, its unique format makes it worth checking out.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|Is it just me, or has biography movies about singers have gotten pretty popular in the last couple of years? First we had Ray, then Beyond the Sea, and now we have Walk the Line, and I am only counting the movies that I can think of, that has come out starting in 2004, even through I do know there has been a lot more movies like this. The movie stars Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, and they both do thier own singing in this movie, rather in some other movies where they either get somebody to come in and to the singing, with the actor lip synching, or even lip synching to the singer's records such in Ray. And who knows what other movies that we see of musical bio picks, and who will play the role, and will they do thier own singing, or lip synching, either to recordings, or whoemver they get to do the singing voice. The movie begins in 1968, when Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) is about to do a live concert in a prison. The name of the prison is Folsom Prison, and then we flash back 24 years earlier, when we meet 12 years old (Ridge Canipe) and his older brother Jack (Lucas Till), who live a life on a farm. Jack spends his time with the bible, Johnny listening to singers including June Carter on the radio, thier father ((Robert Patrick) drinks, and thier mother (Shelby Lynne) retreats into gospel standards from the Heavenly Highway Hymnal. But then saddness hits the family, when Jack is killed in a circular-saw accident. And there father says that god took the wrong boy. And then we flash to 1955, when Johnny Cash is married to his high school sweetheart Vivian Cash (Ginnifer Goodwin). Johnny Cahs so goes by Sun Studios where he sees aritists pefroming, and decides to become a singer, and even tries out for Sam Philips (Dallas Roberts), and  hits the road, where seen in cameos are Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton), Roy Orbison (Johnathan Rice), Waylon Jennings (Shooter Jennings), and Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Malloy Payne). And then soon he meets June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), and then he falls in love with her, and tries to win her over. And like I said before Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon does all thier own singing, and not only that, Joaquin also learned how to play guitar for this movie, if you love bio pics, or anybody in the movie, or a big Johnny or June Carter Cash fans, then this is a must for you to add to your list. <br /> <br />   <br />
0062515675|5.0|This book makes you examine your own life, if you see similarities with the main character, and reprioritize.  We get caught up in the hustle and bustle of everyday life and forget what is important.  The main character gives up all material things in his life and discovers what lives within himself.  I have given this book to a couple of people and am now rereading it.  Easy read.
B000GG4KTU|3.0|Ten years from now people will look back on this album as a product of Diana's transitional period, both in her professional and personal life. Her voice is maturing in subtle ways and she's experimenting with new directions here. Most of the album is comprised of big band arrangements of jazz standards. In \\"It Could Happen to You\\", \\"Isn't This a Lovely Day\\", \\"Day In, Day Out\\", \\"Willow Weep For Me\\", \\"Come Dance With Me\\" and the title track, Diana is backed by the Clayton/Hamilton Jazz Orchestra. These are big tunes with lots of horns. Frankly, I don't think Diana's pipes are quite up to the task of dealing with a horn section. Someone like Ella Fitzgerald could handle it--man, could she ever--but Diana's smokey sultry voice works better for me in a softer, more intimate setting. Her recordings with small ensembles and string orchestras are simply radiant. Here, the trademark sensuality of her phrasing is occasionally, slightly, unsure and she seems to be straining a bit to keep from being overwhelmed by the brass behemoth behind her. The other tracks, where she performs in a trio or quartet, are another story entirely. Diana is in top form on them. I especially liked \\"Exactly Like You\\", \\"I Was Doing All Right\\" and \\"You Can Depend On Me\\".<br /><br />So, although this album is something of a mixed bag, I think it's one that Diana Krall fans will want in their collection. If you're new to her work, probably you'd want to start with some other album, like \\"Live in Paris\\" or \\"When I Look In Your Eyes\\".
1878424319|5.0|The words in this book are both challenging and useful.  It challenges the way you look at the world and asks you to rethink everything.  In the end, the Four Agreements are quite useful and a real challenge to practice in everyday life.  Keep trying.  They work.
B000G7PMD2|4.0|So.  Mad props to LaBrie on this recording.  I don't think he's ever sounded better (save the screaming part toward the end of \\"Octavarium.\\"  that reeks of cheese.).  The drumming feels a little muddy, but that's my only gripe, well, that and the song selection wasn't exactly perfect.  But I can feel the intensity of the night from the recording!  Must have been a magical show to witness.<br /><br />Highlights include \\"Innocence Faded\\" which show LaBrie still has the versatile vocal chops of his youth and \\"The Spirit Carries On\\" along with \\"Metropolis.\\"  Also, it's cool to hear and have \\"Another Won\\" and \\"Afterlife\\" in a live setting.  \\"Vacant\\" didn't live up to my expectations especially considering it was done with an orchestra.  It didn't feel as intimate as the studio release, nor as desolate, which gave the song its power.  Of course, \\"Six Degrees...\\" and \\"Octavarium\\" transfer well to a live setting with an orchestra.  Even though I definitely prefer _Live Scenes From New York_ I must admit I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the show.<br /><br />Great job, Dream Theater, this is a stellar live release that could have easily turned boring since it's the third one in five years.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|I have an almost love/hate relationship with this movie.  I love that there is a new take on it and some of the more youthful feeling characters in this adaptation.  What I hate about it is how much they leave out.  One of the biggest and most emotional part in the book is Kitty's elopement, and in this movie it lasts for about 2 minutes and seems of almost no importance. If you have never read the book or have seen the BBC version, I highly reccomend this to you as a movie.  But if you have, this might make you heartsick to see how much of the storyline is changed and missing.  By the way, I think the soundtrack is great.
0141301139|5.0|This is one of those backyard gardens tales, featuring the ever so clever and resourceful Mr. Fox who frequently outsmarted three most unpleasant farmers, namely Boggis, Bunce and Bean, each time he went up to their farms to get his family dinner everyday. The farmes did whatever he coud so they could catch Mr. Fox but everytime they failed.<br /><br />One day, they ended up fed up with their failures on catching Mr Fox, so they tried to get him at their entrance hole to the Foxes den. Their plan wa sto shoot and kill as Mr. Fox shows himself, but the plan changed to digging him up. In result, they trapped Mr. Fox and his family and other \\"diggers\\" starve by the farmers action. Mr Fox could only make this up to his family and the rest of his friends by digging his way out of trouble. While he digs out his brilliant plan, the thre farmers just sits patiently at the gates.<br /><br />Once again, an awesome story for kids, not quite a morally uplifting book but it's an awesome book I enjoyed reading and I be placing this in the list of books I would be reading to my future kids for them to enjoy this gem. Got to love the front cover. Interesting characters and great plots for kids to actually enjoy.
B000002UZ4|5.0|I have to say that this is my second compact disc because the other one got scratched up. I decided since I love their music to buy another one because the one hit that I love the most is Suburbia. I love listening to it over and over again. I love the other hits like West End Boys and What have I done to deserve this? and others on this collection. I love the sound and keep thinking about London, England and being on the underground or the tube. It's quite a great collection!
B000FA57RG|4.0|The documentary was very very good and it could make a better person out of you! It's very spiritual but very complex like Madonna herself. The audio cd is very good, but it sounds so polished that you wonder how much of her actual singing voice was dubbed or tampered with. It could've been better but now we only have to wait endlessly for the reivention tour dvd to come out!
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|I loved this film for reasons slightly different than some of it's other praisers. Instead of the obvious homage to film noir, I would lump this film in my own \\"flashy directorial debut\\" genre, alongside Blood Simple and Donnie Darko- a film filled with promises to come. But where others see suggestions of David Lynch, I see Coppola's Rumble Fish or the Outsiders, a resemblance that I've not seen others pick up on so far. The actor playing Pin even has more than a little resemblance to a young Mickey Rourke. I had a lot of fun also picking up dialogue tidbits from other films. \\"It's a hell of a thing\\" Tugg mumbles about a killing. Eastwood's Unforgiven? Maybe. There are at least a dozen more. This is just as much about the love of cinema in general as it is an homage to one genre in particular.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Forrest Gump is an absolutely brilliant film that captures the 60's and the early 70's in the same way that Frank Capra's wonderful film did for the WWII generation.<br /><br />Seeing events through the eyes of a simple man like Gump allows the film to explore the entire social revolution, vietnam war, race relations and everything that made the 60's so volatile without being judgemental or preachy.<br /><br />Ultimately Gump though simple remains grounded in his values and his worldview that he largely got from basic moral teachings his mother gave him while the world around him goes more than a bit crazy.<br /><br />Forrest Gump is just a great film and the acting of Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, Sally Fields and others couldn't be better. One of those rare movies that hits on all cylinders.
B00005V9IL|4.0|This is an interesting science fiction film in part due to the strong performances from its characters which lend credibility to the tale. This film is interesting but somehow its potential seems unrealized. The director's ethereal approach is in itself enigmatic yet the film is not quite the enigma that was intended. It seems somewhat inconclusive rather than truly thought provoking. However, it is captivating and entertaining with impressive cinematography, special effects and a notable score composed by Alan Silvestri.
0380789035|2.0|I dropped out of this one by about page 200.  I have read and thoroughly enjoyed Neverwhere and Stardust so I was eager to read this book.  Unlike the earlier works, American Gods failed to engage me. I love to lose myself in a good book, to feel like I'm part of the story; but when your main character is unaffected and apathetic to all that's going on around him,as Shadow is, it tends to make the reader feel the same way.  I'm sure if I hung in there it would have picked up a bit, but I don't like having to work so hard to turn pages. Life is just too short and there are a lot of good books out there.

055350259X|1.0|You get your money's worth here--there are a ton of CDs in this audio book. Unfortunately, I found Bryson's prose (which I enjoyed a lot when reading silently, as I have done with his other books) to be greatly irritating when spoken aloud. To me, he sounds kind of 'affected' in parts, and sometimes there is a sort of \\"moist\\" sound when he pronounces words. Hard to describe until you hear the CD, but trust me on this one. I think a lot of the positive reviews on here are for the book, and not the CD. I would stick with the written word on this one.
0440418569|2.0|The Golden Compass was an exciting, straightforward adventure. The Subtle Knife introduced more characters and more storylines. The Amber Spyglass, the third and final installment, is the most complex and sophisticated of the books, but it is also the least compelling (and the most macabre).    The book is uneven. The storylines following Lyra and her friend Will are still interesting, but a significant part of the book very slowly follows the scientist Mary Malone as she gets to know a new world. Also, certain aspects seem inconsistent: a group of ghosts manages to fight in a war although we learned earlier that they should dissolve upon entering our world (the solution is apparently that they had to _try_). Of course.    Pullman's anti-religious sentiment is so blatant and didactic as to be tiresome. Many books criticize organized religion, and I'm sympathetic to some of their arguments. But Pullman has statements like, \\"The Christian religion is a very powerful and convincing mistake, that's all,\\" which theme he hammers home again and again and again. We get the point: finishing this trilogy was actually the tempting mistake. And although Pullman rejects organized religion and the god of his book's universe, he champions another force that - like a god - claims to know the truth about everything and that Pullman's characters never seem to question the accuracy of (this is the dust that powers Lyra's golden compass).     The audiobook is still well done; it is a pity that the text cannot support it very well.    Note that while the first book in the series may be appropriate for younger adolescents, be aware that this book contains quite a bit of violence, some of it gruesome, and a number of sexual intimations.
0743298020|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in years. The author is not \\"fluff\\"; her choice of words are outstanding. I bought two of these books thinking they would be great fun for my son and me to read since it appeared the subject was of similar interest, but I will tell you we both were 'literally' blown away. He called this morning to say how sorry he was this book had ended and was lost as to what to read next after reading a book of this caliber. Buy it you'll like (love)it!
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This is my first John Mayer CD. I've read a lot of good reviews on the internet about this album so I decided to take the plunge. And this CD was certainly a good buy. He's come along way from his earlier material. Just judging from what I've heard on MTV and the sort, it seems like \\"Continuum\\" is a big improvement. I think he's on the right track. This album might be the biggest surprise of the year. I really didn't expect this sort of album coming from him. John Mayer really has a terrific voice. It really didn't grab my attention before, but I think this material brings out the best qualities in it. \\"Continuum\\" is impressive. He's got real talent. The most surprising track for me is \\"Belief\\" because I never thought his voice could slide across a slick bass groove like that. Lyrically, it's a bold move to attach something with such gravitas to more of an up-tempo track. But he makes it work flawlessly. He's definitely someone to watch in the future. His progression as a recording artist should be interesting. \\"Continuum\\" suggests that John Mayer is brimming with potential. I look forward to hearing more from him.     Favorites: I Don't Trust Myself  (With Loving You), Belief, Gravity, The Heart of Life, Vultures, Slow Dancing in a Burning Room, Dreaming With A broken Heart, I'm Gonna Find Another You.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|\\"Walk The Line\\" is supposed to be about the ups and downs of one John R. Cash, but in actuality, it's three stories in one.  The first story is that of Johnny Cash, who grew up in Arkansas a poor farmer's son.  His father was hard on him and even cruel when Johnny's older brother passes in an accident.  As Johnny gets older, he pursues a career in music.  His first big break comes at the hands of none other than Sam Phillips.  You know him for his many acts which include the King, the Killer, and the Man In Black (Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Johnny Cash, respectively), among others.  Cash begins to become very successful and slowly spins out in a self-inflicted chaos of sex, drugs, and rockabilly.<br /><br />The second story is that of June Carter, the \\"other\\" woman in Johnny Cash's life.  They befriend each other innocently enough, but as they spend more time on the road together, both of their marriages fall apart.  Cash's wife, Vivian, becomes very guarding of her children (and rightfully so), and Carter tries hard not only to save the life of Cash, but also to fight off her urges to love him.<br /><br />The third story, and my personal favorite, is that of the music created by Cash and Carter.  Their duets are amazing, and they reverberate throughout this biopic.  My personal favorite is \\"Jackson,\\" but none of the songs in this flick are to be missed.<br /><br />Overall, this is a wonderful biopic to watch.  I'd have given it five stars if it weren't for the fact that the music takes such a precedence in this movie, that we are only given a brief glimpse into the torrid life of Cash.  If you're not a fan of Cash's music, you may find yourself bored during the long scenes on tour.  I personally enjoyed them, but my wife just couldn't take it.<br /><br />The cast is wonderful.  Joaquin Phoenix is almost eerie in his presentation of Cash.  Reese Witherspoon is a spitfire as June Carter Cash.  She delivers one of the best performances of her career in this flick.  Ginnifer Goodwin plays Vivian Cash, Johnny's first wife, with tears almost permanently fixed into her eyes.  Robert Patrick and Shelby Lynne play Cash's parents, and do a wonderful job of it.  Sam Phillips and his bunch are also gamely represented here.<br /><br />I highly recommend this flick to fans of Cash or of Country and Rockabilly music in general.  Cash's music is legendary, and so is he, but let us not forget that behind every good man is a good woman (in this case, two good women).  Vivian was there in the beginning, when Johnny was starting on his downward spiral.  June literally saved him from falling into nothingness, and both of these women deserve as much credit for Cash's iconic status as he or anyone else does.<br /><br />An excellent film.n this flick.

B000H0MKGK|5.0|Another terrific John Mayer album. John's lyrics are, as always, brilliant. This album is a bit more mellow than the others, but nonetheless enjoyable.
B00003CXDD|4.0|I remember when \\"Willow\\" first came out on the big screen.  I remember how cool it was to watch the skull-helmeted General Kael ride onto the screen.  I loved the swordplay of Madmartigan.  The trolls were the creepiest things I've ever seen.  Flash forward twenty-eight years, and \\"Willow\\" has lost some of its luster.  It doesn't appeal to me as much as it did when I was a youngster.  However, it is still a great film to watch with your family.<br /><br />For those uneducated, \\"Willow\\" is the tale of one Willow Ufgood, a little man who stumbles upon the child of a \\"giant\\" person.  This particular child bears a mark which proclaims her to be the person who will eventually overthrow the evil and powerful Queen Bavmorda.  Bavmorda has sent out her warriors to murder every baby in the kingdom until she finds the one with the mark.  When dog-like beasts attack Willow's Nelwyn village, he is instructed to take the child and give her to the first Daikini he finds.  This is where Madmartigan enters the scenery.  He mildly agrees to help Willow on his quest, but things eventually turn into one great escape after another.  A climactic battle between good and evil is inevitable.<br /><br />Willow is played by Warwick Davis.  Fans of horror will know him as the leprechaun in the \\"Leprechaun\\" films.  Fans of sci-fi will know him for playing Wicket, the Ewok friend of Princess Leia in \\"Return of the Jedi.\\"  He also provided the body for Marvin in \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\\"  The rest of the cast is built up of huge future stars, little legends, and established character actors.  Billy Barty has a bit role as the Nelwyn village wizard.  Val Kilmer portrays Madmartigan, the slightly oafish, very deadly swordsman who aids Willow on his quest.  Everyone should know Kilmer.  He's been in tons of films from \\"Real Genius\\" to \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau\\" to his legendary turn as Doc Holliday in \\"Tombstone.\\"  Jean Marsh portrays Bavmorda, and, much like another reviewer stated, she seems to be channeling the evil queens of the older Disney flicks.  Joanne Whalley (Sorsha) and Pat Roach (Kael) round out a very reliable cast.<br /><br />The special effects look very dated compared to today's films.  However, it should be stated that this film was an early pioneer in modern special effects.  There's even a documentary on the DVD explaining the beginnings of \\"morphing.\\"<br /><br />Overall, this film has aged relatively well as far as being a family film.  It's rather violent at moments, but it is an overall safe film to watch with your kids as long as they can handle violence on the level of films such as another 80's fantasy fest, \\"Krull.\\"  I don't recall much bad language at all, but be warned that there are quite a few deaths in this film, from impaling on swords to being eaten by a very \\"Rancor\\" monster-like two-headed dragon.  You'll also notice a number of references to the Bible, and to the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" books.<br /><br />If you grew up with this film as I did, you'll probably enjoy the memories of the film.  However, it can be rather boring at times for adults.  I'd still add it to my collection if I were you, if for no other reason but to enjoy it with your own children and see the amazement in their eyes that once sparkled in yours.ed, she seems to be channeling the evil queens of the older Disney flicks.

B000001Y9I|5.0|Band Personnell: <br />Ian Gillan - Vocals <br />Steve Morse - Guitars <br />Roger Glover - Bass <br />Ian Paice - Drums <br />Jon Lord - Organs and Keyboards <br /> <br />After Blackmore departed again, Satriani took over to complete the world tour of their last album, but he left shortly after without even a official recording, Blackmore's fully replacement was Steve Morse, he showed new life to the band and many even think this is the best they have done since the first part of Mark 2, this album is great.
B000GRUS22|5.0|I gave this album a rather harsh review after only having listened to it several times, but after putting on the headphones and drifting into that limbo between consciousness and sleep, I discovered how lovely this album is. Don't compare it to the previous works- it's very different, but still very much Enigma. It's an album that really benefits from headphones, because only then can can you pick up the subtleties and complexity of the composition, which at first may seem very simple. At first, there seems to be little distinction between the songs, but this also changes after repeat listenings. It's a great trance album and a great Enigma album.  Give it a chance.
B000002L1L|5.0|Band Personnell: <br />Ian Gillan - Vocals <br />Ritchie Blackmore - Guitars <br />Roger Glover - Bass <br />Ian Paice - Drums <br />Jon Lord - Organs and Keyboards <br /> <br />This album should originally be a Mark 5 album, called \\"The Crattle Grazes on...\\" but because of the Rainbow style sound Turner was kicked and let Gillan return, they changed the album name and most of the songs, because of this reunion, Blackmore left the band for good under the world tour, he got replaced by Joe Satriani so they could complete it. <br />This is a fine album, the best since \\"Perfect Strangers\\".
B000H7JD4K|5.0|I was listening to Dance of Death for several weeks before I got this new album, and I remember how it had to grow on me. The current Maiden sound is difficult to describe. I've been a fan since the 80's but lost favour in the Blaze Baley era because his vocals could not portray the Maiden message. Ever since Brave new World, the band has been re-energised. It is a mixture of pure hard metal glazed with a maturity that is only gained by a longevity such as theirs.    A matter of life and Death is a truly special experience. A Maiden fan's first impression is to like it. However as you keep listening, the musical riffs grow on you and you are captivated by the tremendous story telling ability of these guys.I think this is the best vocal performance by Bruce in 10-15 yrs.    This album contains some really special tracks. How can you not get goose pimples when listening to The Longest Day, or be swept away by Brighter than a thousand suns? Watch out for Breeg, which I believe will be a classic in the future on par with Hallowed etc.    In short this album defines what progressive metal is...from the band that started it 25yrs ago!    Strong points:    1. Its a very hard album...don't let the soft intros fool you  2. There's a lot of creative music from intros to solos  3. The lyrics are powerful and idealogical as is typical of Maiden  4. These songs can only be brought to life by Bruce Dickinson!  5. Yannick gers has fully integrated his style into the three guitar setup    Folks, after hearing this album a couple of times, I can't put it down. It may well be the BEST STUDIO production put forward.    Long Live IRON MAIDEN
B00000JBFW|5.0|Band Personnell: <br />Ian Gillan - Vocals <br />Ritchie Blackmore - Guitars <br />Roger Glover - Bass <br />Ian Paice - Drums <br />Jon Lord - Organs and Keyboards <br /> <br />In 1980, the very first Deep Purple singer Rod Evans joined a fake reunion, this \\"Deep Purple\\" toured around and got very bad rewievs, in the end the real Deep Purple members stepped in and took this fake band to court, Evans and his pals lost. <br />This was maybe the reason why the real Deep Purple tried to reunite for real in 1981, but because Gillan didn't wanted to and if Coverdale did, Blackmore denied to, something that resulted three more years before Gillan left Black Sabbath to accept joining the reunion in 1984. <br />This is the reunion of Mark 2, and for those who loved this lineup will think this album beats everything Deep Purple has done in eleven years, a great album and a great buy.
0316172324|4.0|It is absolutely amazing how much we take for granted about our abilities as human beings with an amazing brain and its capabilities.  I think that I read this book in one night.  I was drawn in by the stories and the science and experiments that offer support to the ideals that Gladwell writes about.  This book really made me think about not thinking about everything (excuse the pun). I learned alot about the unconscious mind and have learned to apply some of the ideals of this book to my life.
0688170528|4.0|When I am in the mood to try something different, it is often hard for me to go into a bookstore and find a new author whose style of writing I immediately like. However, when I picked up Jodi Picoult's The Pact, the first four paragraphs convinced me I had to get the book. After starting to read, I couldn't put it down.   <br /> The Pact is a story about two teenagers who grew up living next door to one another, and to their parent's hopes enter into an intimate relationship once they get older. However, several years into their relationship, the two seemingly make a suicide pact that goes wrong, resulting in a horrific tragedy for both families. In the first page, the shocking act occurs, though, it is not until the end that the reader finds out what and why it truly happened. <br /> The Pact is a uniquely written book in the sense that it goes through the thoughts of every main character, revealing how each feels about the tragedy, and the aftermath. I appreciated this because it is not told through the eyes of just one character, allowing the reader to connect to all the characters as they explain the reasoning behind their actions. It also frequently skips from the present to the past, helping the reader to piece together their own assumptions of what really happened, yet also clarifying various holes in the story as it unfolds. The Pact is definitely a book that goes through many issues and emotions that are relatable to teens and parents alike. This is definitely a book that will make you want to pick up the phone and call your loved ones, and if you're even a slightly sensitive person, in my opinion, will allow you to have a good cry.
B000H305U0|5.0|I have to admit...when i first put the cd in and Futuresex/Lovesound started playing, I was worried.  But after a few listens, it, as well as the rest of the cd started growing on me.  It took awhile, because the music is so different from most of what is considered pop now.  It is definitely worth buying.  I highly recommend!
0060254920|5.0|If my family were to be stranded on a desert island with only 1 picture book, I'd choose this one. It was my favorite when I was a kid, and is now my daughters' favorites. Why? Well, the illustrations, to begin with. Wonderfully detailed and funny, my kids spend several minutes looking over each. My favorite part is the sequence of Max's room turning into a forest.  <br /> <br />Then there's the story itself--Max is too naughty, gets sent to his room without supper, and ends up voyaging to a wilderness where he becomes king of the wild things. But in the end he longs for home and returns to find his supper, still hot. How could you not love that, child or parent? Sendack seems to have a direct line into children's minds. <br /> <br />This book is wonderful to read aloud. The language is poetic, and children will love to \\"roll their terrible eyes,\\" etc., along with the wild things. <br /> <br />Altogether, a perfect book.
B00004YZ36|5.0|This is an outstanding set of music, of any variety/vintage. The interpretations of all the concerti are luminous and iridescent. They bring to mind Liszt's observation about Mozart being \\"music's genius of light and love\\". I prefer them, without reservation, to the Perahia set which I also possess. All the concerti are lively and with such splendid insights, that it would appear that one is hearing several of the movements for the first time.<br /><br />I heard them sequentially from #1 to #27, and cannot find words to do justice to the last concerto, which is one of my favorites. Rather than merely being slower than normal, or melancholy, it is so suspended between the earth and the sky, that one feels lifted into some alternate sphere of existence. The outcome of this magic is that when the 6/8 time of the finale is first heard, one is left gasping for air. This is the finest and most satisfying interpretation of #27 I have ever heard. My only complaint is with #24, in that it does not aspire to the symphonic reaches it attains with Wilhelm Kempff at the pianoforte, but then that I hold true for every other interpretation of that concerto as well.<br /><br />All in all, a genuinely beautiful and lovely set for anyone who loves the Mozart piano concerti and hears them as frequently as do I. Recommended without reservation!
0307346609|4.0|Looking to read something off the beaten path completely different? Max Brooks science-fiction novel presents itself as a chronicle of the battle for humanity between humans and their undead foes. Writing in the guise of firsthand accounts of survivors and veterans of the war, Brooks tracks his story from the first Zombie rising in China, through the harrowing \\"Battle of Yonkers\\" and then finally to humanity's last stand to recapture their world from the lurching, moaning undead. Some ripe political satire and a few obligatory gross-out scenes keeps the pace moving briskly, as Brooks cloaks his prose as true fact, at times emulating non-fiction books like The Greatest Generation.\\" At times this one-trick-pony does go off the rails a little bit, but the author should be congratulated for taking a novel concept and making it work. If you like \\"outsider\\" fiction, this is for you.
0618680004|1.0|Be careful if you are immersed in subjects that advocates `fundamental rationalism' that filters into the way you live your life and in your relationships - before you have realised, you are trapped by your intellect and your heart has closed. There seems to be a genuine lack of wisdom and humility in what many professors like Dawkins, in so-called `prestigious positions', are teaching, with an over-excess of pride and arrogance in addition. Sooner or later people like Dawkins will realise we are more than mere `machines' that just pro-create, that `love' is more than mere `brain stuff' and that life is more than mere `material'. It is just a matter of time. <br /> <br />We need worthwhile wisdom to guide us in our modern lives that can be stressful and hectic. `Wisdom' is to gain worthwhile knowledge, to apply it in life to gain experience and from that experience you can make good choices that guides you in the right direction in life. You know whether you are heading in the right direction: you feel more clear, more free, more alive, more love and more happiness. <br /> <br />Here is an extract from a book by Ryuho Okawa who is one of the wisest and profound people in the world today. <br /> <br />`You may well be proud of your modern sophistication - but do you know anyone today who has achieved sufficient knowledge of the Truth to be able to gainsay any of Buddha's teachings? And what about the Truth taught by Jesus 2000 years ago? How can anyone claim that is meaningless? With more than 1 billion people still finding true wisdom in Jesus's teaching, is it really possible that the God in whom he believed was no more than a futile conviction or his own deliberate invention? <br /> <br />Today it is a fact that many people regard `science' as more important than teachings which have earned the veneration of men and women for thousands of years. Unhappily, this view is actively encouraged by a small number of scientists who wish to be identified with the prestigeand authority attributed to science in this way. Some consolation can be found, perhaps, in the thought that this minority cannot in any way compare in stature or character with the great teachers of wisdom. To those people who adopt an attitude of pseudo-scientific rationalism, saying that they would believe in spirits if they could see them, all that can be said is what a pity it is that their outlook is so limited. Limitations like this can be overcome, and the knowledge that is utterly worthwhile attained, just by meditating on the work of those great spirits who have undergone incarnation and become humans, such as Jesus or Buddha. Surely this is the very basis of `scientific enquiry'? <br /> <br />In practical life we touch the divine consciousness at times when extreme emotions are engendered - when we are in love, or when there is a birth, a death, sickness or disillusionment.' <br /> <br />If you really wish to know the true nature of yourself and of existence, then read the book, `The Laws of the Sun', where this extract was from. Be warned though, you will need more than the supreme might of your 5-senses and the king of your intellectual rationalism to fully comprehend - you will need open-mind and heart. <br /> <br />Whatever path you take in life, may it be one blessed with much happiness, wisdom and love.
B00008OM7N|2.0|Since I ranked the last one I did a review on I feel a need to do it here.  I may have given 'The Tough Guys of Kung Fu' 10 pack a 2 stars but this set is far worse.<br /><br />On the cover it tries to get you interested with names like Bruce Li, Jim Kelly, Bruce Le, and Bolo Yeung.  I could have certainly have added some more names to intrigue you like like Yusuaki Kurata, Chen Sing, Ron Van Cleef, Jason Pai Paio, Dorian Tan...<br /><br />The bad thing is that all of these movies are retreads that show up in almost every collection, but you get a couple of new ones.<br /><br />1.-SNAKE CRANE SECRET-this is a decent movie with Mang Fei and Dorian Tan and a super bad villian.  Directed by Wu Ma who also has a good cameo, he doesn't focus on charater development or anything but one scene that did stand out was when these people are betrayed and the old master dies but won't fall down and just stands in front of the door acting as a guard.  It is a great part that seems out of place in this movie since this is a true 'chop sockey flick'.<br /><br />2.-THE IMAGE OF BRUCE LEE-this is my 2nd favorite performance by Bolo ever.  He really gets to show his athleticism in a couple of fights.  Bruce Li performs decently though the action is only slightly above average.  The final fight with John Chang and Yin-Chieh Han(the big boss in Bruce lee's first movie)vs. Bruce Li is decent.<br /><br />3.-BLACK DRAGON-this movie being ranked #3 really shows you how bad this collection is.  It has a story that a 2 year old must have wrote with how irritatingly simple it is.  Jason Pai Paio is good in this.  Ron Van Clief plays a stupid character just like everybody else does in this movie.  The final fight is maybe the 4th best fight in a movie that did not have very good fighting to begin with.<br /><br />4.-KUNG FU THE INVISIBLE FIST-this movie I have found out is also called The Good and the Bad and stars Chen Sing and Yusuaki Kurata and it is a film by Ng See-Yuen.  It is not a very good film and even though it is like an hour and 45 minutes, it still seems like some things were cut out.  That is not a bad thing though.  This movie tried to be very emotional and very real, and it didn't do that bad of a job.  The thing is is that I need some serious action when I see these great kung fu stars  on screen and a super boring story like this one.  Well I got more than my fill in the finale.  No really good martial arts action, but it goes on forever and ends up being pretty fun.  Not a bad film for 1972.<br /><br />5.-SCREAMING TIGER-this is a movie where Jimmy Wang Yu comes to town to beat everybody up.  Not one of his finer movies.  Down on the bottom with Rage of the Master.  The movie isn't all that bad, but they really try to thrill you during the final sequence and do a horrible job.<br /><br />6.-BLACK SAMURAI-a horrible Jim Kelly movie that has all of the nude parts cut out but the midget fights are left in.  Even a very offensive racial slur was left in/  Make sure you get an uncut version of this movie if you seek it out.<br /><br />The rest of the movies are complete crap.  A horrible G-rated bio story of Bruce Lee and Ninja Connection which I actually didn't watch.  Rounding it out they throw in Bruce Lee Fights Back From the Grave and Dragon Lee's classic, Champ Against Champ.<br /><br />All of these movies are full screened but watchable.e an hour and 45 minutes, it still seems like some things were cut out.

0618680004|1.0|Dawkins claims to be a scientist. Science is based on the empirical method, that is, it tests hypotheses using appropriate means. Dawkins applies his rational mind, and the fundies apply their emotions. Neither is appropriate. In all cultures, east and west, the only people who've tested religion empirically are the saints. Paramhansa Yogananda, a great Indian master of yoga, said, \\"At the inner end of the human nervous system, the mind, interiorized, communes with God.\\" Dawkins and the fundies aren't likely to make THAT experiment any time soon. They aren't interested in experience. They'd rather bray about things unseen.
B000GRUMPU|2.0|When I watch films I like to play a game invented by David Letterman called \\"Is this anything?\\" The game is played thusly: You watch a performer and decide if the performance is something.<br /><br />This film is nothing. It has almost zero character development, very predictable storyline, cheesy dialog, and amazing special effects. When are studios going to learn that until your story is as solid as your special effects you've got nothing?<br /><br />This movie is about a ship sinking and people escaping. That's it. I just summed up the entire movie and all its important plot points in 10 words. That's not a good sign.<br /><br />The problem with this film is, a rogue wave hits Poseidon (that's the name of the ship they are all sailing on) about 15 minutes into the 1 hours and 40 minute movie. That leaves 15 minutes for the character development of no less than 8 characters. The rest all end up dying so there is no use expending energy on their lives is there.<br /><br />The problem with having the disaster come so soon is that there is no time to develop character so when the actors are thrown into their perilous situations you think...Who is this guy again? And why am I supposed to care? The death of a character only takes seconds on screen while it takes a good while to develop an interesting and compelling character. What they should have done, was spend the whole movie developing the 8 main characters and then have them escape over the course of the last 15 minutes. I guarantee that would have made for a much more interesting film.<br /><br />That, incidentally, is one of the things that made \\"Alien\\" such a great film (especially when compared to so many other monster movies). Ridley Scott spent more of the film building the characters than he did killing them off. I think the monster doesn't even make its first appearance until halfway through the film. Wolfgang Petersen can make a good film, but this is not one of them. This film is utterly ridiculous despite the excellent cast.lous despite the excellent cast.
B000A59PMO|4.0|WHAT A COMPLETE CLASSIC SHOW!<br /><br />i have been this excited about a show since buffy & miami vice!!<br /><br />it keeps you wanting more and teases you at the end of each episode<br /><br />and your like \\"AWWWWWW COM' ON!!

B000FVQM2Y|4.0|This is a classic film noir with a twist. It has all of the elements of a film noir. You have you murder in a big city, and the follow-up investigation by the \\"private eye\\" (in this case a concerned amateur). You have the private eye's best friend who can somehow get information on anything and anyone. You have the drug kingpin (referred to only as \\"The Pin\\") and his hired muscle. You have your cheating female in distress and your femme fatal. The story is about doomed characters trapped in situations they are not responsible for. And here is the twist: all the characters are in high school.<br /><br />As a recently graduated filmmaker, I have seen a lot of student films. The problem I have with most student films is that they want to have this epic story of drug dealers, mafiosos, hit men, etc. But all the parts are played by college students and you think...this is just a bunch of college students pretending to be drug dealers, mafiosos, hit men, etc. It would seem that a film noir composed entirely of high school students would never work. But it does.<br /><br />I think the reason this film works is that it takes itself so seriously. Everything about it screams film noir. The characters talk like they are in a film noir. They say things like \\"I've got knives in my eyes, I'm going home sick.\\" and \\"I've got all five senses and I slept last night, that puts me six up on the lot of you.\\" You never hear people talk like that in real life. When you first see \\"the pin\\" he has a black cane and a cape. Seriously? Have you ever seen a high school student wearing a cape? But that's precisely why it works. It creates a whole new world that you have never seen and it doesn't back down for a second in presenting this world to you in all its gritty detail.<br /><br />This film works and yet it knows that you are suspending a lot of disbelief and throws in a couple scenes to let you know that it is ok to laugh if you want to. There is a great scene where the \\"private eye\\" and \\"the pin\\" meet at the dining room table of the pin's house and his mother serves them lemonade.<br /><br />The actors are all top notch. The camera work is great. The plot is twisty and unpredictable. Overall this was a very engaging and fun cinematic experience.<br /><br />Side note: If you are a fan of Film Noir see if you can pick up two direct references to \\"The Maltese Falcon\\"and \\"the pin\\" meet at the dining room table of the pin's house and his mother serves them lemonade. <br /> <br />The actors are all top notch.

B00005JP89|5.0|It is 1900 in Vienna, and the Chief Inspector (Paul Giamatti) is telling the story of a peasant boy who was once the secret playmate and love of little Countess Sophie; they planned to run away together, but their plan was discovered and they were separated.  The boy traveled the world and learned the secrets of magic, returning  home as \\"Eisenheim, the Illusionist\\" (Edward Norton).  He is reunited with the Countess (Jessica Biel) again, quite by accident, during one of his shows and they resume their romance, even though she is soon to marry the ruthless Crown Prince (Rufus Sewell).<br /><br />One never knows for sure what is real or illusion in this story, and it kept me guessing until the last scene.  Norton's powerful and  charismatic performance carries the film.  He has the piercing glare and smug confidence of someone who knows all the secrets and is quietly controlling all the action.  Giamatti's character is oddly compassionate and kind-hearted for someone with his power.  He should have been more menacing, like Sewell's completely odious Prince.  Both Giamatti and Norton attempt unconvincing European accents, the story is too long, and it would have been better with more romance, but I still enjoyed it.  The period sets and costumes are lovely and those who love magic will be delighted.
0300108834|5.0|Ernst Gombrich was an amazing man.  His excellent book \\"The Story of Art\\" is recognized as the standard work in Art History, and he made many other contributions to the field as well as to society in general.  His \\"A Little History of the World\\" was his first book, the only one he wrote in German, written just as he was finishing his studies at the University of Vienna in 1936.  He wrote the book very quickly and it was a success until the Nazi's banned it for being too pacifistic.  By that time Gombrich was already living in England, where he remained for the rest of his life until he passed away in 2001.     In the preface to my German edition, Gombrich's granddaughter says that an ex-horse riding teacher was engaged to provide the illustrations for the book for 5 shillings a piece.  She says that Gombrich liked to point out that the many horses in the illustrations were drawn much better than the people.     This book has remained very popular in German speaking countries.  It is a serious history book worded in children's terms.  Quite often Gombrich speaks to the reader in first person like \\"though you may have seen pictures of the famous pyramids, you can't imagine how large they are\\" or when describing the benefits of multiplying with arabic numerals over roman numerals he asks \\"would you have made such a practical discovery?  I wouldn't have.\\"  For an adult that wording becomes a bit tiresome, but for children it is as if they are speaking with a very knowledgable friend.

1860498825|5.0|I first read Sarah Waters book, Affinity, and had to read more of her work. I initially decided to go back to Tipping the Velvet but found something about Nan's narrative voice too similar to Margaret's and felt I needed a break from their meek, awkward, (sometimes girlish) obsessiveness and so decided to move to Fingersmith and return to Tipping the Velvet at another time. I am so glad I did! Fingersmith is a completely engrossing work of fiction with a bevy of unusual characters and unexpected twists that compell the reader forward - sometimes at a dizzying pace.<br /><br />I loved the use of the overlapping narrative and was delighted by the opportunity to see the story from both Sue's and Maud's perspective. Less talented or experienced writers would have made the recounting of the same events seem repetitious and unnecessary but Ms. Waters utilized this technique to add new depth to the story and surprise the reader.<br /><br />The growth of Ms. Waters as an author is clearly evident when you compare Tipping the Velvet (which I am now back to reading) and Fingersmith. The level of detail about the characters, the setting, and the period are so strong that the worlds of Briar and the Borough are brought to life in vivid detail. While this is something typical of her work, I think it has strengthened as her experience has grown.<br /><br />As much as I loved this novel, I did agree with one reviewer who mentioned feeling let down by some of the vagueness of more ancillary characters - Mr. Lilly especially - or the inexplicable nature of some of the scenes/situations. I too had moments where I wished she had taken more time to develop these elements but for me, it wasn't enough to take away from my enjoyment of the novel. There are very few works of fiction that can reach the kind of perfection that would answer every reader's questions and I think there is some value in leaving us with something to consider beyond the final page.
0743298020|5.0|This is one you don't want to miss if you are looking for a beautifully written story.The author has a way with words that I haven't encountered in a long time. The story itself is timeless. The author seems to have purposely avoided specific dates which somewhat adds to the mystery of Mrs Winter's life. Be ready  for a read that compares with some of the classics os English literature.
B00003CXCD|4.0|This was Audrey Hepburn's big movie debut and it was a stellar one. She plays the crown princess of an unnamed European monarchy who is visiting Rome or a PR tour. She is tired of it all. She just wants to be a normal girl. She wants a holiday.  <br /> <br />She sneaks out of her embassy and falls in with Gregory Peck, an American journalist living in Rome. At first, Peck does not recognize her but, when he does, he knows he can get the scoop of his life. He squires her around, seeing the sites of Roman and surreptitiously taking notes and photos. He is also falling in love with her. <br /> <br />All too soon, she realizes that she has to get back. By this time, she has fallen in love with him as well and that makes for a painful parting. It also makes for a difficult choice for Peck. He can publish his story and make his fortune at her expense or he can suppress it and remain poor. <br /> <br />This was a delightful vehcle for Hepburn. She plays her part wonderfully and any viewer would be hard pressed not to fall in love with her. The story is very dated and simple but it is still wonderful. I'll go slumming with Audrey Hepburn any day! <br />
B000HA4W4S|5.0|I think this new second album is really worth the wait.  It refines the quality of the Sisters' killer debut recording, and adds more music hall to their repertoire, making \\"Ta-Dah!!\\" (love that title, makes me laugh) a different listning experience.  It's still a helluva lot of fun, but there is more melancholy here, and darker elements, which shows the fab five-some are not content to merely repeat themselves.  Sure, there are familiar sounds all around here, but they are more streamlined.  The band exudes musical growth here and many of the songs are growers; many of them don't reward you until the second or third listen.  I think this is good, as if songs like these reveal their secrets right away, they will be rendered disposable.  Here, these songs are richly LAYERED, with many complexities, both musically (writing and arrangements) and lyrically.  Plus, it sounds very fresh, and will be an enticing record in 10 years.  I love these kinds of records; they are delightful.<br /><br />Now, the songs, I have no problem with the sequencing.  At first, it seemed a similar order as the debut, with more ballads at the front and disco rock in the second half, but it's not that simple.  I think you have to live with the record for a while before you can make any judgements.  The first single, \\"I Don't Feel Like Dancing\\" is a fun oxymoron of a song, and it resembles Leo Sayer's \\"You Make Me Feel Like Dancing\\" but not as disposable, mixed with an upbeat 70s Elton tune & a slight Bo Diddley beat.  It's a good choice of first single and starts \\"Ta-Dah!!\\" off with a bang.  All the songs are cool here, and an early fave is the delightful Ana Matronic-led disco rock romp \\"Kiss You Off\\", with a slam bang of a chorus.  And I love how the album ends with the uplifting, gospelish rocker \\"Everybody Wants The Same Thing\\", leaves you feeling fuzzy.<br /><br />Now, the packaging on this limited edition, talk about a deal, wow!!!  This thing is an import pressing but priced enticingly cheap for Americans, like $11.99 here AND Best Buy!!!  Unlike that one person, I LOVE this packaging!!!  Really creative, novel, swell and cool.  And I had no problem opening it up.  What you do is you do NOT open the left side at all.  You pull out the right side with your right hand while gripping the top and bottom with your left, and, the way it's designed, both sides open at once, like the elevator doors it's designed to be.  Very simple really, but very VERY cool!!!  Whoever designed this thing should get an early Grammy for best packaging, I'm serious!!  Anyhoo, the sides open, with the flaps open and the discs are inside, \\"Ta-dah\\" on the left side and the bonus disc on the right side.  The slick surface of the cardboard ensures that the discs will not get scratched up inside this package, unlike similarly packaged, booklike editions where the discs are directly on top of paper surfaces, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />The 6 songs on the bonus disc (5 songs really and 1 cool remix of IDFLD) are more experimental.  They are (I imagine) from the same \\"Ta-Dah\\" sessions, but didn't fit the flow of the album proper but are good enough not to leave on the cutting room floor.  I haven't absorbed it all, but definitely, the best song here is, I agree, the funny \\"Making Ladies\\".  There is also a free Best-Buy 3-track EP in BB stores, with 2 further remixes of IDFLD and another album outtake called \\"Ambition\\" which is swell, like a Steely Dan-ish jazz rock song with a satisfying & complex melody and arrangement.  It's weird how the 12-track album, \\"Ambition\\", and the 5 bonus songs (no remixes) could have all fit together as a single 18-track 78-minute CD, but they broke it up into digestible pieces.  I guess people complain about albums being too long and stuff, and here, they could have a point.  \\"Ta-Dah\\" is a swell 47 minute and change ALBUM with a nice flow.  Jake is in fine voice here, both in fine falsetto (the type of falsetto Daniel Powter TRIES to do on hisalbum but comes up short) and velvety croon.  The writing here, by Jake and Scott, is creative and melodic and fun, the arrangements top notch, the whole kitten kaboodle.  Even the Judy Garland dialogue sample fits (on \\"The Other Side\\").<br /><br />A fine fine job by all...an easy contender for album of the year.on his album but comes up short) and velvety croon.

0767817710|5.0|I love the plot in this movie. I think that Sharon Stone and Gene Hackman did superb acting jobs in this movie. I can watch this movie over and over. It is not just your regular \\"gunfight in town\\" kind of western. Gene Hackman is so talented, he plays his roles so real that the movie viewers want to hate his guts. He is so believable in any role that he plays. Leonardo Dicaprio was superb as the impressive young man wanting his overbearing father's approval. Sharon Stone seemed like she has been slinging a gun all of her life.
B000FBGBPC|3.0|i got hooked to 3DG when i heard their first album. one-x still has the undeniable intense guitar riffs that i love so much about them and crazy-rockin' drum patterns. but i think that there is something lacking in this album - their rawness. one-x seems to cater more for market than it is for thier hard-rock fans. don't get me wrong...all tracks are still very good, but that's just it...they're not as raw. <br />vocals wise...did adam have some vocal lesson? i must say his vocals is stronger in this album than the last one. in the sense that it is more mature. <br />overall, three stars for this album. mostly for their lyrics and melody.
B00009EJC5|5.0|I bought this on vinyl when it came out in '86 and wore the groove right off it. Good thing CDs last forever. \\"Funky Drummer\\" must be the single most sampled song on the planet. Everybody in the world has used it, even Sinead O'Connor! The version of \\"Give it up or turn it loose\\" that appears on this is so good, it will make you want to slap your momma down! (In Southern parlance, that's damn good) If you listen to this CD, the \\"Star Time\\" box set and one or two of the \\"Live at The Apollo\\" CDs, you'll know that God exists, because James Brown was no accident.
1932100660|5.0|I have read about and tried a large number of eating and diet programs in an effort to be healthier and feel better.  Most of those books are written in a sensationalistic, \\"I'm right and you're stupid if you don't believe me\\" tone.  I had just about given up on finding any \\"truth\\" amongst the vast amount of information available.  Then I found The China Study.  It is written in a style that is easy to read and compelling, but never preachy.  All of the research is completely documented in an extensive bibliography.  There are numerous facts that can't be ignored.  This book has convinced me to change my lifestyle, which I previously thought was reasonably healthy.  The author speaks in a matter-of-fact tone and never addresses the reader as if he/she is dense, as many books do.  He inspires confidence and he is incredibly qualified to write about what comprises healthy food choices.  I highly recommend this book if you feel lost by all of the \\"latest research results\\" touted by the media and the vast sea of contradictory diet information available.  You will be shocked by the role money and power play in the nutrition information that gets filtered and fed to the general public.  The main focus of the book is research studies that connect diet and disease and why we've heard so little about them.  It's not a diet book, though two pages are dedicated to recommended foods.  I found it incredibly refreshing, inspiring and motivational.
0618680004|5.0|As with most of Dawkins books, his insight is thorough and probes deep into areas other writers haven't explored.  Dawkins in this book clearly discusses both sides of the issues with quotes and reflections from either end of the debate.  Of course, he weaves it together wonderfully to make assertions of how religion has deluded our knowledge and forced others to close their minds to ideas that have been historically untouched because of religion.  As I was born a Catholic Child, I wish I was raised a child of Catholics.  It is unfair to impose a religion on a child, but atheists have taught that morals don't have to be taught through religion.
B00000IL26|5.0|Lee scored a double victory with this one, magnificent music and popular recognition. Nothing could get in the way of those horns, trumpet and tenor sax skate across ice with tremendous agility and zero drag, heralds of bright harmonies to dance for! Pianist Barry Harris nails home the groove, keeping it simple so the horns can sky write 'Viva la bop revolution,' in all its refined glory!
B000HCO8IQ|2.0|I like the first album because it has a lot of soul and it has a quirky playful sound to it.  This album fails to deliver in the songwriting department, save 2 or 3 songs.  Even though their debut sounded retro, it still sounded completely original in its delivery, and thats what made it special. <br /> <br />This album sounds like a carbon copy of late 70s songs, and extremely boring ones at that.  I was extremely dissapointed,  I was hoping for a more original direction for this band.  I thought they could stay around for a long time.  Maybe they still will be popular after this album, but I found it quite a step backwards from their debut.
B000HA4W4S|3.0|Horrible (sorry, I know I covered that in the title) packaging!  I nearly tore the item apart, trying to a) figure out how it opened, and b) actually open the thing.  Instructions - and better construction - sure would have been nice. <br /> <br />The case is tabbed on the right hand side, for easy pull-out access - but not the left.  Both sides need to pull out in order to get to the CDs.  What the heck? <br /> <br />The design is cute and creative - have to give them credit for that - but I'm very disappointed with this as a package.  The bonus tracks are awesome (especially \\"Making Ladies,\\" which I think is better than most songs on the regular CD), but I doubt I'll be touching it too much.
B0000033OZ|5.0|When I first listened to this LP way back in 1970, I was taken aback by the power of this music. I knew the music of The Nice,  and I didn't believe that anything could top the first record of King Crimson, the majestic: \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\".  Oh, boy was I WRONG !!!  ELP  not only broke down the walls that stood between  rock music and  classical,  They smashed the walls apart, crossed through and built totally new worlds of music that were  so new, so fresh that nobody at this point was even close on their heels.<br /><br />I brought this prize over to my friend Larry's house, sat him down and thrust this gem upon his turntable. He sat there in a cold silence during: \\"The Barbarian\\"  and about half-way through  \\"Take a Pebble\\"  he got up from his chair and stormed outta the room to get away from this music and this record... We never spoke to each other ever again.<br /><br /> There are only  six tracks on this record, but each of them matters as an important piece of this record. To my mind they are more like 'Movements' of a single work of music. Keith Emerson, was thinking outside the box, and was looking forward into uncharted waters. ELP was to sail out there and explore, no matter the cost. Progressive rock didn't start here BUT this first recording by Keith, Greg & Carl set the bar, and they set that bar VERY HIGH.<br /><br /> By the mid-seventies there were hundreds of bands all over the world  TRYING to imitate this record (many of them built careers on their imitations) But, this first album of: Emerson,Lake & Palmer along with the first release from: King Crimsom were the pioneers that started a movement... IF YOUR EARS WORK,  LISTEN TO THIS... FIVE STARS !!!

0743298020|5.0|I have not enjoyed a book this much in years, and to think I purchased it on a whim.  England's most famous living novelist has for years intrigued and confused her public by giving widely disparate accounts of her life.  Close to death, Vida Winter decides that she will set the record straight and have her biography written, her true story.  For the task she chooses a bookish young woman who has previously published only one short biography of two brothers. <br /> <br />Thus begins the most captivating of tales, replete with a huge ancestral house in disrepair, home to a rather peculiar family.   Skeletons lurk in closets and keep company with the occasional ghost.  The plot twists and meanders as the famous novelist weaves her story.  We become the young biographer eager for each new chapter. If that were not enough, this book is so well written that it was a pure pleasure to read.

Some are funny, some make you sad and there are those that make you examine a few things in your own life. Everyone has secrets. There's even a possibility that when you turn the page your own secret will stare you in the face even though you haven't mailed one in.

B00007FOMP|5.0|1971. The sixties were over, but the Vietnam War wasn't. The Watergate break-in had not yet occurred, but faith in the U.S. Presidency had been eroding for several years. Crime as a matter of fact in daily life was slowly infecting the inner cities, following a decade marked by police brutality at the Watts riots in Los Angeles and the demonstration at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago (not to mention the National Guard at Kent State in 1970). The severe inflation of the mid to late-70s had not yet started to strangle the American economy, but that hardly made it any easier for those who were already suffering. Finally, the busing crisis, which attempted to integrate the races and ended up only dividing them further, was still on the horizon. Amid all of this, perhaps no single record in popular music more perfectly captured the transition from the idealistic 1960s to the painfully realistic 1970s than Marvin Gaye's What's Going On.<br /><br />As almost all before me have pointed out, the title of this album was not meant as an interrogative statment, but a declarative one. He was not asking listeners what was going on, he was telling them. And yet, one cannot help but detect more than a mere whiff of disbelief and helplessness in his voice when he sings the title track. In that sense, one is surely not too far off the mark in hearing the words \\"what's going on\\" being sung with a question mark after them, even if they are printed on the sleeve without one.<br /><br />The title track of Gaye's masterpiece sets the scene perfectly. When he sings \\"Brother, brother, brother, there's far too many of you dying\\", he is acutely aware that his fellow African-Americans accounted for a disproportionate number of the American troops in Vietnam. (Among whom was one of his own actual brothers, whose 3-year tour had ended in 1967.)  Furthermore, the cry of \\"Father, father, we don't need to escalate\\" none too subtley suggests both the generational differences over political issues, as well as the personal differences between Marvin Gay, Sr. and his son (let us not forget how Marvin Gaye met his untimely death). Finally, the lyric \\"who are they to judge us/simply cause our hair is long?\\" rings a true note of solidarity with hippies, most of whom were white. In his own search for hope, Gaye embraces pure religion (\\"God Is Love\\", \\"Wholy Holy\\") rather than an amorphous spirituality, be it drug-induced or otherwise. But still, he is not so naive as to deny his own dependence on drugs or that of those around him (\\"Flyin' High\\"), which exists - at least in part - because of all of the things that he sings about on this album, and for the sake of escaping them.<br /><br />The record closes with one of the best performances of his career, \\"Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)\\", which serves to remind the listener one-by-one of the issues addressed by whole songs throughout the record. In terms of these issues, specifically the one on \\"Mercy Mercy Me\\", Gaye could really only take solace in the fact that the Clean Air Act, the EPA, and Earth Day were all established in 1970. While Gaye clearly had his finger on the pulse of the times, he was also very much aware of the consequences of the things he knew would never disappear as if they had never existed. Thus, if hope was more or less gone for the current generation of adults, we were at least obligated to \\"Save the Children\\".<br /><br />What's Going On gave Motown a voice of protest, and a musical document as prophetic as anything Bob Dylan ever recorded. On \\"Inner City Blues\\", Gaye proclaimed, \\"God knows where we're heading\\". This is a particularly interesting statement coming from him. Considering that some of the worse crises of the 1970s were still to come, Marvin Gaye seemed to have a pretty good idea himself.ver political issues, as well as the personal differences between Marvin Gay, Sr. and his son (let us not forget how Marvin Gaye met his untimely death).

0596009208|5.0|After reading a great book titled \\"Thinking in Java (JAVA 1.4)\\" by Bruce Ekcel.  That book is so far the best book I have read on JAVA so far.  It has TONS of information and for the most part the author does a very good job in explaining the information.  However my main complaint with the TIJ book was that it was very hard to read at times due to the author's writting style.<br /><br />I ordered Head First Java to fill in some subjects that didn't quite stick from reading Thinking in Java and just to basically get a second perspective of the language from another author.<br /><br />This book does an excellent job in explaining JAVA concepts and the authors' fun writing style make it easy to follow along.  The pictures make concepts easier to grasp.  The code in the book works for the most part but there are some errors in the code, however if you have been following along they are easily caught.<br /><br />As others have mentioned this book does not cover EVERYTHING on JAVA 5.  Off the top of my head, I can tell you that this book does not explain ANONYMOUS inner classes or reflection. This book however does enough to get you started writing JAVA apps and has made some concepts that didn't quite stick with the TIJ book easier to understand.<br /><br />This should not be your ONLY JAVA book because some things ARE left out that would make some of the program more robust.  A perfect example of this fact is that annonymous inner classes are not taught in this book, which are very good for coding actionListeners for GUI components.  But with that being said, this book should definetely be one of your first because many of the topics they do go over are taught very well.  Once you finish this book you should be more comfortable with the more \\"advanced\\" books like Thinking in Java which is also a greak book as I have already read the 1.4 edition. After finishing this book, I plan to read Eckel's Thinking in Java (JAVA 5 edition) book next and I suspect it will be easier to follow along.<br /><br />You do need a little programming experience to be able to get the most out of this book as it assumes you already know some things.<br /><br />For what this book is supposed to do it does an excellent job and has been the best JAVA book I have read so far as far as presentation is concerned.<br /><br />I also got Head First Patterns and am eager to read that book as well.<br /><br />Stay away from the Learn JAVA in x minutes/hours books!

B00005JMJG|2.0|I was into the concept, the idea that memories which you no longer wish to keep can be permanently erased from your mind. Unfortunately, by the time these scenes were shown I was sick and tired of the various characters. They were whiney, boring, combative, and very profane.(The R rating is well deserved). At times I felt  I would have very pleased if the entire cast(almost) had been rolled by a beer truck--at least then the misery I was feeling at having to watch these neurotic n'er-do-wells would be over. It didn't happen and some masochistic urge forced me to watch to the end.  <br /> <br />To be fair, there was one enjoyable area. The tenacity and will of the Jim Carrey character in refusing to let go of the memory of the Kate Winslet character, along with some nice special effects as this played out. Also, the ending would have been very compelling--if only I could have cared! I didn't.    <br /> <br />This should have been an excellent movie, but wasn't.  Pity.
B000002UB6|5.0|I've always thought that the \\"Get Back\\" sessions were one of the most fascinating periods of the Beatles' history. The back-to-basics concept; the infighting; the iconic rooftop concert; the multiple attempts to create a finished album from dozens of songs and hours of aimless tapes; the treasure trove of bootleg material that surfaced years later. The album that finally did emerge from the sessions, \\"Let It Be,\\" is as intriguing a document as any other produced by the band. The Beatles have such a reputation for perfectionism that it's refreshing to hear them let loose and bash out a few jams. And despite the palpable strain of the sessions (captured in the \\"Let It Be\\" film), their musical partnership was still strong and capable of producing amazing collaborative efforts.<br /><br />The first two efforts at constructing a \\"Get Back\\" album (which are available as bootlegs but should really be released officially) are more faithful to the initial goal of the sessions: to capture the band's live sound and reduce their dependence on overdubs and retakes. Phil Spector's finished product retains the dialogue, jokes, and technical blemishes. It also edits, lengthens, and adds orchestral overdubs to several songs (but by that point, the Beatles had largely abandoned the back-to-basics idea anyway). The result is a unique hybrid of studio sheen and rough edges, meticulous craft and fluid spontaneity.<br /><br />It also contains some of the Beatles' very best songs. George's dryly humorous \\"For You Blue\\" is a personal favorite. Universally acknowledged classics like \\"Two of Us,\\" \\"Get Back,\\" \\"Let It Be,\\" and \\"Across the Universe\\" speak for themselves-- how any album containing these songs could be branded a disappointment, I may never understand.<br /><br />When discussing \\"Let It Be,\\" it's common to hear the cliche that a bad Beatles album is still better than most bands' best material. Forget that. \\"Let It Be\\" is a great album in its own right.
0743454537|4.0|Overall, I found this to be an excellent book. The story was very well done. Clearly Ms. Picoult has done her homework as it was well-researched, but not too scientific or technical. Having the story told by different narrators added a great deal to the narrative. It really brought the point home that each and every one of the characters was affected by Kate's illness in some expected and unexpected ways.<br /><br />One thing really detracted from the story and that was the romance between Anna's lawyer, Campbell and Anna's guardian ad litem, Julia. I found this storyline in the book terribly contrived and unnecessary. In a state as small as Rhode Island, it is a little far-fetched to think that 2 attorneys who were lovers in high school would not have crossed paths in the fifteeen or so years since they graduated. This was a totally unnecessary part of the story. I noticed that Ms. Picoult did something similar in her book Plain Truth. These contrivances cheapen her otherwise outstanding stories and I really hope she has avoided doing this in her other books.
0805080120|4.0|This was the first book, I read on the evolution of language. <br />It is fascinating to read, how language might have developped form simple words to most complicated sentences. Unfortunately, it sometimes bogs down into too much detail, at least for the general reader. (Steven Pinker's \\"The language Instinct\\" was much better for the generally interested layman). <br />It also clearly and convincingly does away with the myth, that there are more and less perfect languages, and it explains, why scholars of all ages have deplored how the language gets worse and worse. (Think about the way educated people still scorn \\"ain't\\".) <br />I also supported my conviction, that our emphasis on \\"proper\\" spelling is only harrassing our children and prevents them from learning important things.
B000005RFQ|5.0|After Ozzy Left Sabbath, the world was over for many fans, but then Dio had a good run.  But what happens when Dio, a legend in his own right leave...well, somehow management cooked up a good one..Ian Gillan.  Black Sabbath's manager at that time was also manager for Ian Gillan, legendary singer of Deep Purple fame.  On Paper, this seems Like a winner, but unfortunately at the box office and fan reaction, not the same. This album is the one piece of history from this short lived line up.  The band at the time of recording included 3 original founding members Toni Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward...but shortly out on tour Ward left due to health and alcohol problems.  This album reflect a Darker side of Sabbath, and Gillan was very strong in his vocals, very powerful on this, which I believe carried over to Deep purple's reunion album of 1984 Perfect Strangers.  Trashed is a faster paced song about an alcoholics and his bender, likely a reflection of what the band was doing at the time. Each song has an instrumental song between on the album, so really about 6 songs and 3 instrumentals.  My favorite riff and song on the album is Zero the Hero...Heavy metal at its best.  Also, Geoff Nichols's (the unofficial 5th member of sabbath since 1979) keybords are hevily featured in the music on this album as well.  Digital bitch, disturbing the priest, Born again, and Keep it warm are the other Standard songs on this album, all I feel are good in their own way, although the lyrics themselves are not deep, Gillan is great.  To bad fans reacted harshly to this album, because it is a strong album, raw power.  Check it out, a great album for rock trivia and two historic groups, Deep Purple and Black Sabbath, cross paths in a different way besides competitors.
0618680004|3.0|This book appears to be an intellectual assault on the logic behind a beleif in god.  But if this was all the book discussed, the logic or illgoic of why people beleive in a higher being.  But if it was just a critique of religion, or rather a critique of why religion is inherently causing violence, then it wouldn't use such strong hyperbole describing Jesus as having \\"dodgy morals\\" or claiming that the Christian god is \\"racist\\" takes any semblance of honest deducation from the text and turns it into another hate text, predictably bashing Christianity while apparenlty claiming all other religions are acceptable and not 'racist'.  Everyone knows there is nothing in the Bible bordering on racism, since racism wasn't invented in the time the Bible was compiled(1000 B.C-400 A.D).  There was no concept of race then, a concept that largely is drawn from Darwinism and the increased exposure of the world's peoples to eachother in the 19th century.  There was no 'race' in 200 B.C.  There were 'tribes' and 'nations'.<br /><br />Beyond this there is the claim that religion is inhernelty violent while iedology based on science and athiesm is more peaceful.  But apparently this book doesnt take into account the violence carried out in the name of communism and nazism, both secualr ideologies and yes, both racist at one time or another.<br /><br />Religion is not inherenlty violent which is why this book doesnt touch on Buddhism or Taoism or other religions that are rarely violence prone.  But it turns out that man made ideologies based on athiesm are just as violent and racist as religion has been accused of being.  Perhaps a better conclusion to this book would have been that humans are violent, after all it was science that allowed for the horrors of the Holocaust and nuclear bombs.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman
B000H5U65C|4.0|I've listened to this four times and I'm just scratching the surface.  These guys are all amazing muscians.  I don't even know how these guys could remember all the tempo changes. The guitarists shred with the metal equivalent of Neil Peart in the background.  Think of Iron Maiden at their peak and combine that with Rush's time signature changes but way faster and like 5 changes in one song.  Four and a half stars because I think Leviathan (the album before this) is a little better.  But it's really just semantics (production-wise they are identical, I don't think that the knobs on the amps or the soundboard were ever moved from Leviathan).  Cool lyrics, super heavy, and melodic at the same time. Josh Homme's presence on one of the songs doesn't hurt either (I'm of course a biased QOTSA fan).  Great album.  Procure it now!
0553288105|1.0|I picked this up at the library since I didn't recall reading it. What a horrible borefest. It drags on and on and on. Even the first few chapters are completely repetetive. In short, he had a poor three-part short story that he turned into a dreadful three part novel.
B00031TXBI|5.0|This is my favourite release out of the set of '6' and second only to 'Shadows Collide With People' in the John Frusciante catalogue. This album rocks harder than anything John has done previously and is a great starting point for fans of the Red Hot Chili Peppers who would like to get to know Johns works.<br /><br />Every song on here rocks, this record is the best example of great guitar playing I can think of. John's good buddy Josh Klinghoffer plays drums and bass while John does what he does best, plays guitar and sings. And he sings very well on this album.<br /><br />Lyrically, it is poetic, raw and honest and describes Johns life post Red Hot Chili Peppers.<br /><br />My favourite tracks on here are 'What I Saw' which is the perfect opening track for any album and I reckon this song would sound great live.<br /><br />'The Worlds Edge', a little slower but just as powerful.<br /><br />'Inside a Break' and 'A Firm Kick' - classic radio friendly songs.<br /><br />'Look On', my fave all time John Frusciante song. Lyrically and musically it is outstanding and features a brilliant guitar solo. At just over 6mins, this song should probably have closed the album as it will leave you breathless and in awe.<br /><br />But 'Scratches', the album closer is just as good. The quitest track on the record, Johns voice sounds great and it is very melodic.<br /><br />This is the only John Frusciante album readily available in record stores in Australia, and hopefully people curious enough will pick it up and purchase it as I believe anyone who is interested in rock music should listen to this and make up their own minds.<br /><br />If only more artists would explore their souls as John Frusciante has, the world would be a better place.
B0000028WD|4.0|The problem with these 2 disc multi-artist concerts is that they're often bloated with lesser performers and lesser performances.  Here, not so, KK says at the beginning of the concert that \\"backstage we have assembled one of the greatest group of perfoming artists ever\\" or something like that, and it's no exaggeration.  George Harrison, Neil Young, Johnny Cash, Eric Clapton, Tom Petty, Eddie Vedder, Stevie Wonder and on and on...<br /><br />And they don't disappoint.  Clapton's version of \\"Don't think twice\\" (though it's near heresy to say this) eclipses Dylan's original.  Mellencamp's Like a Rolling Stone, Lou Reed's Foot of Pride, Stevie Wonder's Blowin' in the Wind, Neil Young's two songs, and Tracy Chapman's faithful Times are the highlights among an amazing set.  And the man himself ain't too bad to hear, neither.<br /><br />Recommended for (especially) all Dylan fans, and rock n roll fans of all stripes.
B00069YE0W|5.0|As you already know this is the final release out of 6 albums for John Frusciante, pulling the curtains down on a busy and very productive period before its back to work with the Red Hot Chili Peppers. While this may not appeal to everyone, any fan of acoustic music should appreciate this. The album is soft, mellow and reserved, and it is clear John has really evolved as a musician and songwriter over the years.<br />The songs are short and sweet but leave a lasting impression. It is only further evidence that John Frusciante is a musical genius and I now rate him only second to John Lennon as the greatest musicians of all time.<br />This is the perfect record to listen to late at night while your lying down with your eyes closed.<br />This is very different to all his previous releases, in comparison I would say it is a more mature version of Niandra Lades and Smile from the streets...<br /><br />My favourite tracks are Lever pulled, Your Warning, Time Tonight and Leap your bar.<br /><br />Time Tonight is very personal and the best song you will hear in a long time.<br /><br />This album is almost perfect in every way and a must for all John fans.
B00005JNEI|4.0|First let me just get it out there that I'm a liberal, I agree with the message of the film, and I oppose most of what the Bush administration has done in response to 9/11.<br /><br />I don't think I can honestly assess Moore's political message because of what I wrote above, so I won't try.  I didn't really need to be convinced.  It would certainly be my hope that an unbiased or right-leaning person who comes across this film would be swayed by what Moore presents, but I can't speak to the probability of that due to my bias.<br /><br />That said, I don't think there's any doubting Moore's skills as a documentarian and as a filmmaker.  I think even honest critics of his political views would have to concede that he knows how to make a movie.  Fahrenheit 9/11 is quite good, regardless of your politics, I think.  It's clever, is fast paced when it needs to be and slows down to dwell on the weightier items, and it does what documentarys should do (IMO): it shows us the truth right in front of us that we'd previously been blind to.<br /><br />I think this film is good enough to merit at least 1 viewing from people all over the political spectrum.  Make what you will of its message, it's up to you whether or not to accept what it says.  But if you enjoy good films, regardless of what side you take, you'll at least be entertained by F 9/11.
0140288503|5.0|It should come as no news flash that this is a fine piece of journalism.  After you've read it, which shouldn't take long, you might think that you blasted out of Mogadishu with Delta Force on the \\"Day of the Rangers\\".   <br /> <br />Beyond the entertainment value, BHD will help provide context to the current events happening in Somalia. <br /> <br />I also highly recommend Bowden's \\"Killing Pablo\\".
B00005JKEZ|5.0|the fable of Robin Hood is masterfully translated to the big screen. this 1938 version, of which there were myriad renditions, is deemed the absolute quintessential version. Errol Flynn is terrific as the outlaw Saxon. Olivia de Havilland delivers an equally stellar performance as the Lady Marian. filmed in georgeous early technicolor, this is a must for anyone's film library.<br /><br />as for the DVD, the picture is flawless and absolutley gorgeous in technicolor and the sound is excellent too. get this one!!!

B000E6UK5K|5.0|The album is awesome. Period. And so is the packaging. And I add a sixth star for the packaging. I'll admit I picked this disc up in a big box store and did not realize that it was only cellophane wrapped until I opened it at home. No multiple razor blades, machetes, or dynamite needed to open and enjoy the disc. Any one who would like to replace the default packaging is sure to have several empty CD cases hanging around - or bum one from a friend. I have reached my wits end with wrestling with CD and DVD 'security packaging' to the point of asking store clerks to open them for me just to see their reaction.
0783231032|1.0|Watching \\"1941\\" made me proud to be an American.  It wasn't the movie that made me feel that way.  It was the knowledge that it was a massive flop in this country.  I never realized the American public had such good taste. <br /> <br />Here we have a movie with no fully sympathetic characters whatsoever.  (The Dan Aykroyd and Robert Stack characters and the Italian civil defense guy come closest; unfortunately, the Italian guy's wife is an extremely offensive stereotype.)  The protagonist (played by Bobby Di Cicco) is a young American man who doesn't want to join the military in the immediate aftermath of Pearl Harbor; the movie never delves into his life and background enough to make his attitude comprehensible or sympathetic.  (All we get is a single line stating that he doesn't want to take orders, which is presumably enough for Hollywood liberals.) <br /> <br />Over the two hours plus of the movie the characters cause millions of dollars worth of property damage in Los Angeles without actually accomplishing anything to justify all the destruction.  If someone -- anyone, but preferably either Bobby Di Cicco's or John Belushi's character -- had succeeded in sinking the Japanese sub, there would have been some point to this movie.  There's a place in the world for pure comedy without socially redeeming value, but not at this budget level.  The only conceivable message it may send is an anti-American one, as both John Wayne and Charlton Heston reportedly concluded when they read the script.  Wayne begged Spielberg not to make the movie at all, and I think he was on the right track. <br /> <br />\\"1941\\" provides a valuable service to young screenwriters everywhere.  By breaking many of the rules of screenwriting, it demonstrates why those rules are good ones.  No movie that aims for widespread popular appeal should have twenty main characters, none of whom is a true identification figure for the audience.  And every movie should allow at least one of its characters toaccomplish something of lasting significance, whether it's saving the world or committing a murder or forging a relationship.  At the end of \\"1941\\", almost all that's changed is the destruction of a house, an amusement park and some planes and cars. <br /> <br />For audiences in 1979, the most frightening moment in this movie must have been in the last scene, when Aykroyd volunteers for the Burma Road and tells Stack that the \\"really big year\\" of the war will be 1942.  Seldom has the hint of a sequel been so obvious.  Thanks be to Hollywood that there was no sequel to \\"1941\\", one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br />(I like John Williams' march theme for Belushi's character, though.)
B000002J1U|5.0|Led Zeppelin is undoubtedly one of the best bands of all time and there is no argument with this album. There is real no weakness here like every other Zeppelin album. This is my personal favorite Zeppelin album and is just a classic.
B00003CXC6|4.0|This bleak, B&W film from 1950 was revolutionary in its time, but I have a bit of sympathy for those who might find it stylized and even a little pretentious today. What is truth?--surely a hard theme to tackle. Seems to me that whether the samurai was killed with a dagger or a sword could be easily determined--at least today. There would be fingerprints, etc. On the other hand, consider how much of the story depends on interpretation. Does the samurai really look at his wife with disgust after she is raped? After all, only she would really know--he doesn't say anything. Is she really fierce, as the bandit says, or weeping and weak as she appears in court? Was Kurosawa really poking fun at the genre with the clumsy fighting, or was he depicting stark reality for an audience that still romanticized ancient times? And is the ending really redemptive--I found myself wondering if the woodcutter would go off and sell the child if it was a girl. Even though Kurosawa intended it to be uplifting--note the shining sun--couldn't we wonder otherwise? <br /> <br />I found this film extremely interesting as a precursor to the notion that truth is ambiguous--but not non-existent. <br /> <br />Did anyone notice that during Machiko Kyo's (the wife) testomony, the score sounded suspiciously like Bolero--but not quite. It was written by a composer named Hayasaka, but I haven't uncovered anything, except that I'm not the first one to think this.

B0009RCPY8|1.0|First off, I gave this release 1 star not for the films themselves, but for how this release was marketed!!  Why sony would re-release these films with LESS THAN what was offered before is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE.  I bought this double dip originally thinking that these were the same discs as the original releases, just re-pressed.  To my dismay, this was not the case.  Some of the key features that were on the original Ghostbusters disc that made it a truly fantastic unique experience are missing here.  A video commentary arranged like mystery science theater....a pop-up video commentary, all the trailers are gone....I could go on with more here because there are more, but you get the picture.  I was lucky enough to get my money back from this farce of a product.  I only cared about the original film anyway so I went out and searched high and low for the now out of print original dvd version and found it brand new.  I just got it today.  In conclusion, dont waste your money on this trash.  Get the original dvd versions that were released a few years back.  Im going to now enjoy my Ghostbusters dvd that has everything on it that it should!!  I found mine through amazon sellers.  Go there and grab it.  Dont make the mistake of buying this unacceptable edition!!

0440211727|5.0|With fiction there is usually some distance between the reader and the action described.  After all, the reader is seated in a comfortable chair, one assumes, in pleasant surroundings.  But such is not the case with this novel.  The distance between this reader and the story disappeared almost from the beginning, and like the Wedding Guest in Coleridge's poem, I was dragged from Ohio to Mississippi in the heat of summer and forced to witness things I didn't want to see but could not avoid. <br /> <br />The book starts with an intense rape, described in detail.  A ten-year-old black girl is savaged by two cretins and left for dead by the side of the road.  When the girl's father kills the rapists, he is arrested for murder.  The book then focuses on his white defense attorney and the trial of a black man for murdering two whites--in Mississippi--although I suspect the tension would be little different elsewhere in America. <br /> <br />The plot is engrossing and the outcome is satisfying.  It certainly kept me reading late at night, long after I was tired.  The characters are extremely well drawn--diverse, individual, self-contradictory.  The atmosphere of a small county seat in the South is perfect.  After reading the book, I think I could find my way through the court house, the little restaurants and the defense attorney's offices.  The dialogue is just as excellent. <br /> <br />It is difficult sometimes to define exactly what the moral position of the author might be.  He seems even handed, understanding of all the parties and their positions.  That can be annoying at times, but it adds to the truthfulness of the book.  All sorts of people get into the action and not always for or against the defendant but rather for themselves.  There is the NAACP--the local ministers--the ambitious prosecutor--the defense attorney who dreams of fame from this trial--and lastly the ad hoc local KKK. <br /> <br />My only reservation would be in recommending this novel to the faint of heart.  The rape is not the only intense scene in the book.  The reader should be prepared for gasping a few times as the story unfolds.  Still, the trip will be worth it.  Brilliant--that's the only word to describe this. <br />
B000HCO840|3.0|I couldn't figure out why this so called \\"Collector's Edition\\" only had one disc.  Special editions usually have two discs, right?  Was it a typo?  No.<br /><br />The ONLY difference between this edition and the regular edition (that is $8 cheaper!) is that there will be a reprinted comic and a special \\"collectible\\" comic included.  So collectible that it will be included in the hundreds of thousands of these DVDs produced.  No extra features, no additional content beyong what is in the regular DVD.  The studio is obviously saving all that for another special edition to be released in 6 months (like X-Men 1.5).<br /><br />Unless you're a huge fan of comics, get the regular release and save the money for Superman Returns on November 28th.
038572179X|4.0|It's easy to get caught up in McEwan's clever writing tool of describing the sometimes knee jerk psychological reactions people have in their everyday life and negotiations with others. These observations with McEwan carry over as they grow from childhood to adulthood and to some extent from fully engaged adults to malfunctioning and sometimes dysfunctional adults.  Your life can drastically change directions because of the jealousies and sometimes love other people may or may not have for you.<br /><br />The first section of three describes a situation with an intelligent and likable 13 year old who ends up, because of jealousy, fear, misunderstanding and anger almost ruining the life of an almost perfect older \\"boy\\" who ends up spending time in prison for a crime he doesn't commit.<br /><br />For me, the set-up of the story worked fairly well, but then sections two and three were anticlimatic and not nearly as poignant even though they were trying very hard to be touching and powerful.  There are long lugubrious descriptions of the horrors of war and the maturing of some of the characters and then the somewhat uninspiring atonement.<br /><br />Yet, in the end, it all makes more sense and comes together as the final pages of the book make us realize that we have been manipulated by a very smart little girl, now old woman. And the things that don't work so well in the plot in sections two and three are meant to be that way because, after all, it is merely a work of fiction \\"inspired by actual events\\" as they like to say more and more in Hollywood, and we know that the actual story is a let down, not even really a publishable story.  Still, although the trick ending puts it all together, I still didn't enjoy sections two and three as much as I would have liked.<br /><br />Excellent, almost five stars.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|One of my favourite albums... A very honest representaion of the Jamaica most people don't get to see, and as a fellow Jamaican, i can truly say this album makes me proud to be one. Well rounded musically, and takes you right through the evolution of Jamaican Music, from Ska (All Night) right up to Old School Dancehall (Khaki Suit) and beyond. I love it all...
B000G759LW|1.0|Yeah she has a \\"great\\" voice (whatever). But she so oversings everything that it completely ruins anything she is trying to achieve musically or emotionally. Too much is too much!
B000H305U0|5.0|From start to finish this album delivers everything from POP, to R&B, to pure Sexy. I don't think there is one song I would skip. With Timbalands beats and Justin's soulful sexy voice, with a little help from Three Six Mafia, T.I. and Will-I-Am this album has a little something for everyone. I especially enjoyed \\"MY LOVE\\", \\"Lovestoned\\", \\"What goes Around\\" (obviously about Brittany), & \\"Until the End of Time\\". This album worth every penny, even the shipping.
B000002HK4|5.0|Dream Theater are an amazing group of musicians.  On this album, they cover a bunch of awesome classic rock songs, and manage to pull them off flawlessly in a LIVE setting.  The performances could be mistaken for live versions of the originals.  John Petrucci, especially does an absolutely incredible job of mimicking other fellow guitar heroes (and influences) David Gilmour, Jimmy Page, and Brian May.   Dream Theater do an absolutely incredible job of covering songs--the fact that they recorded these songs live blows my mind everytime I listen to it.  The recordings are crystal clear and the performances are sensational. <br /> <br />The only original song on here is the title track, which happens to be a whopping 23 minutes long.  It's actually one of Dream Theater's all time greatest tracks, and a huge favorite among fans.  Between the ingeniously covered material and the original magnum opus, the album is an exceedingly impressive piece of music.  It's also a very telling, gracious homage to Dream Theater's prog rock influences, as they cover material by Queen, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Journey, Kansas, Elton John, The Dixie Dregs and Genesis.  Highly recommended album.
B000IJ79UW|5.0|It is about time that this classic gets the full treatment--loaded with extras.  However, if you are also interested in the Superman II special edition, it is more cost effective to get the \\"The Christopher Reeve Superman Collection - (8-Disc Deluxe Special Edition)\\" which is currently the same price as buying this set and II, only you get films 3 and 4 too (which is better than paying for them, right?)<br /><br />Also, Amazon has the Richard Donner Cut of Superman II available for pre-order which has the extended version of the film never before available (the special edition will be the theatrical release only).
B0000AQS0F|5.0|So sad that the best tv shows never quite make it on television. Why? Shouldn't the decision of a great show be that of the viewers? If you read the reviews on this site, you can see how the public thought of this show. Yet it was cut short anyway. For me, this has been the most outstanding series I have seen since My So-Called Life, which was also short lived. I never got into Buffy or Angel so this has been my first introduction to Joss Whedon's creations. Brilliant writing, acting, story-line and effects. And a witty humor that really adds a charm to the characters. Each episode left me wanting to the see the next one. I got onto this series late, never seeing it when it was originally on the air. But after seeing Serenity in the theater, it sparked my interest in finding out where the source was. Compelling, intreguing and clever, this series delivers a solid performance. Even though it is set in the future, it is relatable and not far fetched, giving you the ability as the audience to really relate with the characters. I only hope Fox, or any other network, realizes the potential of this wonderful show and brings it back to life. Otherwise, Joss...I anxiously await the next movie!
B0006GAOBI|3.0|I really wanted this film to be a GREAT film. Based on the things I'd read about it, and what I'd heard from others, it sounded like the kind of film that would enter that pantheon of films that I must watch at least once every year or so. And I do believe that \\"Donnie Darko\\" is a very good film - I have watched it three times thus far, and there aren't many films on which I would spend that much time, if I didn't find them intriguing.  The film is extremely well-made, and evokes an atmosphere of darkness and foreboding very effectively.  The gleaming unreality of 1980s suburbia, which seems to just barely cover over some mysterious darkness lurking beneath which threatens to erupt and overwhelm the surface world at any moment, compares favorably with \\"Blue Velvet,\\" which achieved a very similar effect.  And the characters and dialogue are richly drawn, and we have high school kids who actually look and act like how high school kids really look and act - a rarity in American film. <br /> <br />But there are still some quite serious problems that I have with it. One is that I don't find Donnie to be a particularly sympathetic character. He's not especially likable - he's smart, but completely self-absorbed, nihilistic, and the friends he hangs around with seem to be a rather unsavory bunch (the \\"Go back to China\\" comment from one, said to an Asian student, being a particularly brutal example). He doesn't have any real problems, either, being the privileged only son of affluent and loving parents who give him anything he wants.  There's a bully who bothers him occasionally, and his \\"emotional problems,\\" although by the end of the film it seems that the latter is, in fact, essential to the \\"mission\\" he's called on to carry out.  Otherwise, Donnie's life seems quite golden, in the American suburban sense, so it's unclear as to what it really is that troubles him, other than the usual teen angst with which all of us must come to terms.   <br /> <br />Another weakness isthat the film seems to simultaneously try to evoke nostalgia for the 1980s, while some sort of critique of `80s values seems to also be implied.  Such ambivalence isn't necessarily a flaw, particularly in view of the light/dark duality that I mentioned earlier in its depiction of suburbia. However - and I'm entirely willing to admit that this as a personal quirk of mine - as I'm only two years older than the film's creator, Richard Kelly, and come from a very similar suburban background, I can't help but react negatively to this setting, as I experienced the same period in the same way, and found everything about the `80s to be vacuous and repulsive.  I'm still not sure exactly what Kelly's trying to communicate about the `80s - whether it's meant to be ironic or not - but I personally found it to be a turn-off.  This may be deliberate on his part, but I remain uncertain, even after multiple viewings. <br /> <br />Although for me, the greatest flaw didn't strike me until I made the mistake of attempting to \\"understand\\" the film.  I was fortunate enough to see the film for the first time in a theater that happened to be screening the Director's Cut - and the Director's Cut of \\"Donnie Darko,\\" I must say, is one of the few such re-releases that I felt actually added something of substance to the original theatrical version (which I have seen subsequently), and I recommend that first-time viewers seek out the Director's Cut for this reason.   <br /> <br />However, even given this advantage, there were still a lot of things about the film that struck me as odd or inconsistent.  I should have just chalked it up to the film's surreal atmosphere, and left well enough alone, but I couldn't help but wonder if I'd missed something on my initial viewing, so I started searching the Internet and going through the special features on the DVD to see what I could unearth.  What I learned changed my view of the film, and not for the better.  (SPOILERS AHEAD!) One thing that stayed with me after my first viewing was the jet engine that plummets from the sky at the film's conclusion - what caused it to fall off the plane in the first place?  There's no way to know this from the film itself.  So I discovered an interview with Kelly in which he explained that the engine was, in fact, ripped away from the body of the plane by Donnie himself, with his \\"new-found psychic powers,\\" and that Donnie discovers at the climax of the film that he's a kind of superhero, replete with super-powers.  I found this to be kind of a cop-out.  After all, there's absolutely nothing in the film itself to support this...no hint that Donnie has \\"super-powers,\\" and yet clearly it's a crucial plot point, since the entire plot revolves around this jet engine.  Further reading only soured my view of the film further.  I made the mistake of reading the text of \\"The Philosophy of Time Travel\\" book (an extra on the DVD) which is featured in the film, although within the film we never find out exactly what's in it.  This is for the better, since I discovered upon reading it that most, if not all of the characters in the film are being manipulated by whatever unseen forces are driving Donnie toward completing his \\"mission.\\"  Frank, the guy in the bunny costume, it turns out is a \\"manipulated dead,\\" meaning that he was sent back in time from the moment when Donnie kills him in order to instruct Donnie in what he must do.  As for some of the other bizarre moments in the film, it turns out that these unseen forces can also manipulate the living, and that when Donnie's psychiatrist warns him about \\"the sky opening up,\\" or when Donnie's teacher tells Gretchen to \\"sit next to the boy who's the cutest,\\" this is all the result of them being manipulated by these mysterious beings.  This, for me, was a huge disappointment.  Basically, what this means is that \\"Donnie Darko\\" is basically about a bunch of characters who are all automatons without free will, being manipulated by unseen forces for some purpose that is never fully divulged in the film.  My reaction to this revelation was, \\"So who cares?\\"  I watch films to see humans reacting in human ways to human situations.  Discovering that the characters in a film are basically puppets being forced to behave in particular ways is, for me, a devastating blow to the film's integrity, and, as I said before, a cop-out, since it gets the characters out of any responsibility or motive for their own actions.  (END SPOILERS) I was willing to attribute the strangeness of the film to its surreal character, but now that I know Kelly's intent, it's hard to put it out of my head when I'm watching it.  Maybe Kelly is trying to say something about free will and determinism that I haven't figured out, but as it is, knowing that the characters are all being manipulated to do and say certain things, it really takes away a lot of the compelling interest in the story for me. <br /> <br />When I've watched the film since finding out these things, I've tried to put what I've read out of my head, more or less successfully, but it's still weakened the film in my eyes. So, my advice to prospective new viewers of this film is: DON'T try to understand it, just take it at face value for what it is. It doesn't stand up to sustained investigation. <br />
6301966562|5.0|This was a favorite movie growing up but I completely forgot about it until this weekend when I saw The Human League in concert, and for their encore they played \\"Together in Electric Dreams.\\"  The memories came flooding back.  I was in a group of 10 people and I was the only one that had seen this movie, but now I learn it'll be difficult to show it to others because it's not on DVD.  Please bring it on DVD, please.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|... why the hero of the movie is kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years, but why he was released after that! <br /> <br />chan wook park's first part of the trilogy 'sympathy for mr.vengence' explores the concept of revenge. the second part 'old boy' too is on the same theme - but in a much more evolved and violent form. <br /> <br />violence, intrigue and tragedy dominates in this offering. but there's  redemption too ... <br /> <br />superb!!!
0553213105|2.0|god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic.  and yes, maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book's great reputation, i entered it with high expectations. - which the book however did not satisfy.  yes, it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time, a lampoon of the courtship ritual, and of course oh so witty, blah blah blah, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.  the main character was likeable, but that aside, i found it completely insufferable to read through, and absolutely painfully boring.  every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted, let alone the ending.  not that anything really ever happens - the entire book could be summed up with, \\"then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea, walked and talked and had more tea, then got married and lived happily ever after.\\"  the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama.  it would save more time just to watch a chick flick.  so if you're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters, witnessing the agony over who's going to marry who (even though the reader could already predict the happily-ever-after match-making light-years in advance), then this is the book for you!!  if not, then i suggest picking up some dan brown.
1563523302|2.0|This book was interesting at first.  It shatters what most of us think the typical millionaire looks and acts like, but that only takes a chapter.  After that, it just keeps repeating itself over and over.  \\"Who do you think bought the $1000 watch and who bought the lower priced watch?\\"  Yeah, yeah, I get it; the millionaire has a lower priced watch than the overspending, no real wealth guy.   <br /> <br />Then some of the examples are so over simplified or exaggerated that you know they are made up to make a point.  I want real examples.  I don't care if you give them goofy code names to protect identity, but don't come up with such bad comparisons to prove a point if it isn't real.   <br /> <br />Then there is the advice on being frugal.  I am pretty frugal, but some of what they said would put me in the crazy house if I had to live like that.  Sure, I could cut out every unnecessary expense from my budget, but then I wouldn't be very happy.  Who cares if I have a million when I'm 60ish if I had to live miserably up until then.  What is that worth?  I know not to go out and buy a brand new luxury car, but driving around my 20 year old Jeep is no fun either! <br /> <br />This book is good for the first chapter and if you are just completely clueless or a compulsive over spender.  People with common sense need not buy this book, just check it out at the library like I did.
B0008ENHTE|2.0|Bullitt is the kind of movie that people like because it's popular, not because it's necessarily any good.  When people talk about \\"tough cop\\" movies, this one always seems to come up in discussion, and invariably people will talk about the famous car chase scene.  It has been called the best chase scene of all time.   <br /> <br />To be fair, the cars are pretty cool.  A late 60s Mustang fastback and a Dodge Charger - the ultimate bad guy car.  And yes, they do go up and down the streets of San Francisco.  For about 10 minutes.   <br /> <br />The actual story has been reviewed and summarized enough on here that I won't get too into it, but it's pretty standard cop material.  <br /> <br />At any rate, for serious Steve McQueen fans, this movie is pretty much required viewing.  But if you're just looking for a good action/cop movie - don't be mislead by the flashy cover art on this one.  The movie is slow and boring, and the car chase is hardly worth the price of admission.
B000EGDC0A|5.0|I work in a creative field and also do some creative projets on the side. To say that I draw inspiration from the music I listen to is nothing new, but upon hearing the meager snippets the previews allow of each song, I knew this album would help take me to places I needed to reach.<br /><br />Within the last week my office creative work has literally come alive and reached new heights of satisfation thanks to songs like \\"Lovely to See U\\", both the original and mixed versions. These songs have a bold feeling, like a tiger waiting to pounce. They build and entice you along nicely and spring a wonderful crescendo of sound on you about two minutes into them and they take you on a wild ride till the very end.<br /><br />Other songs, like \\"Koko\\" and \\"Let It Take You\\" help you rein in your more excited emotions and give a great break for relaxing and contemplating.<br /><br />The entire album is infused with a breathy, sexy attitude, very fresh and original. At least, to this electronic addict. Favorite songs: all of them.
B0000C9ZBW|4.0|I tried to get in touch with Skagen to get the actual grade of the watch, but even after 6 months, no answer.  Titanium is strong but its alloy is greater (Aircraft Grade, of commercial grade is used in many cases for an almost scratchless effect).  This may be only pure titanium (like a pure gold, softer, hypoallergenic and usually preffered, but its lasting quite nicely.  I have worn this watch every other day and there are no scratches on the titanium or the crystal even after banging against walls and stainless steel.<br /><br />The Stainless steel band obviously is not as great but i havent seen any scratches on it either.  I am very happy with this watch and would recommend to anyone who doesnt want to spend too much.  This watch is great quality and great design.  It's shaped like a spaceship on the bottom kind of, so when its worn it looks even thinner than it actually is.  I love it.  Slim and elegant, perfect watch to wear to impress.
B000654YRY|5.0|Great Concert!!! <br />I've had the cd for years but it's always nice to actually see those fingers. I am a huge Knopfler fan and have seen him live 4 times. This DVD brings me right back to the show. CLASSIC DIRE STRAITS!! I Highly Recommend it for any fan of the band or any fan of guitar. <br />
B00008CLOA|5.0|I don't understand what everyone's gripe is about the sound of this disc, I think it sounds really great. Anyway, \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" is a masterpiece by Pink Floyd, it really captures their brilliance. I would not hesitate to recommend this version to anyone looking for \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\", it's as good, if not better than the original recording. I'm pleased with it, all of the songs are great, though I think \\"Money\\" and \\"Brain Damage\\" are my favorites. But, it's all great. Highly recommended.
0380715430|5.0|I disagree with several of the reviews here which cite several specific points of contention as making the book entirely worthless. I think it easily earns 4.5 - 5 stars. It IS over a decade old now, and I don't think it is intended as a source for scholars of English. But, for the amateur linguist and even the wannabe linguist it is a great read. I can't compete with some of the above reviewer's scholarly points, but I don't think replacing some of Bryson's dogma with their own is worthwhile. Mother Tongue is a great starting point and very educational. \\"Bryson's Dictionary of Troublesome Words\\" is also a great introduction and gets 5 stars from me.
B000001EXR|1.0|I own them all...this is the worst.  Kiss' attempt at grunge/very very heavy rock.  Uhh, it is so bad except for 1 or 2 songs which are tolerable.
B000HA4W4S|4.0|I have to agree that you must listen to this set separate from their debut. If you take my advice, you'll discover a more musically mature and complex recording, still full of hooks and fun melodic and harmonic turns, some of which are reminiscent of the Beatles (if I could be so bold as to suggest).  In other words, if you're hoping for more disco romps and electroclash quirkiness, you may be disappointed.  Open up to this set, take a deep breath and listen actively.  It will grow on you! <br /> <br />One more thought: I can't help but to feel that those who panned Scissor Sisters' debut as fluff or even crap would like this one.  And those who loved the debut seem to be critical of this one.  Can't make everyone happy, I guess.
B000HCO8IQ|5.0|The Sister's second album is a fine addition to their debut from two years ago. While diehard fans may be a little dissappointed that this album takes fewer risks with subject matter, the music is far from bad. <br /> <br />While their first album turned off many mainstream customers that liked their radio singles with it's raunchy lyrics and gay content, this album has definitely been produced to be more mainstream. While not all subtext is gone, the lyrics with one exception (one f-bomb) could be played around your kids without you having to cover their ears. <br /> <br />Elton John's cameo on their first single 'I Don't Feel Like Dancing' sounds great. She's My Man. Kiss You Off, and The Other side also can stand up there with any song off their debut.
0807126063|5.0|Shamefully, I'm a newcomer to the genius of this book having only recently heard about it on the movie \\"Sideways\\" (also a 5 star entity). It is masterfully written and just so damn funny. Ignatius is an amazing, horrific creature that despite your best efforts, you can't help but sort of admire.
B000C65Z1G|2.0|This is billed as a thriller but there are hardly any thrills.  It would have benefitted from some judicious cutting to make it a little leaner.  The shaky camera work detracts from some decent scenery. <br /> <br />The politics of the film contain no subtlety or shades of gray; I can almost see a couple of college sophomores hitting the bong and sitting down to hash out the script: <br /> <br />Bong-hitting liberal student who has no clue about the real world #1:  ...and then she discovers the evil corporation has been testing... <br />BHLSWHNCATRW #2: (Interrupts)  \\"Evil Corporation\\"?  Why are you being redundant? <br /> <br />The only plus for my wife and I was the acting, which was great.  Fiennes was especially good, underplaying his character in the early parts of the film, resulting in a character with depth and nuance.  I only wish the rest of the film was worthy of the performances contained within it.
B0009R1T7M|2.0|Don't get me wrong. This is a great album. He accomplishes exactly what he set out to do with uncanny ease: to produce the most non-threatening album ever made about the state of Illinois. Hell, it's even more non-threatening than the only band ever named after a city in Illinois. And that's saying a lot. I have to question when popular music took this turn into being completely innocent and non-confrontational. With Third Eye Blind? The Gin Blossoms? John Mayer? James Blunt? The fact is Sufjan and his ilk are a marketing campaign away from being VH1 darlings, a la Mayer and Blunt. It's music girls can play in their air-conditioned Camrys on the way to the office. It's music thier boyfriends can play while internally struggling with their buried homosexuality. And while the songs can be irresistibly catchy and it's produced beautifully, the whole preciousness of the album turns me off. Rock and roll is supposed to be threatening. And folk music? Folk music has its roots in confrontation, in questioning the status quo. This is where I get completely flabber-gasted by this \\"new folk\\" misnomer. Its not folk. It's like really well-produced alternative Mayer-rock. And that's it. Its not a bad thing or a good thing, really, I just think the praise being heaped on Sufjan is coming from the wrong angle.  And for that I'm giving a great album- in all it's sterile, innocent beauty- two stars.

B0002J4X1Q|5.0|Like many that have seen this movie, I have been a fan of the video game series for years, and this movie never disappoints me. It has everything that makes RE great; strong characters, interesting story and scenes that make me jump. At first, it is sad that no video game characters make it on to this movie, but Milla Jovovich is great as the heroine Alice.<br /><br />The special effects were really good for this movie. The licker and the dogs were really impressive. The action is also very entertaining. When the action is happening, I find myself not being able to turn away, it is very fast paced. I also really enjoyed the scene when the security lasers were slicing up the team. The Red Queen was an interesing villain as well, maybe even more so than the licker. Overall, this movie is way worth seeing and having if you are a fan or even if you aren't a fan of the games. The movie is just fun
B000HA4W4S|4.0|I think their debut is a perfect 5 star CD. Ta-Dah! is a very good follow-up. It's in the same mold as the first CD. Very retro 70's sounding, but, updated so it sounds fresh and new, not dated. If you like their debut you will definitley like this. I didn't give it 5 stars because I don't care for the sequencing. The first four tracks all sound very similiar and give the false impression that the all the songs will be the same. If they were scattered throughout the CD I think it would be a better listen. That being said, it's fun, engaging and memorable. On your second listen really listen to the lyrics: their very witty, smart and funny.
B000HL0K98|5.0|Star Trek's second pilot episode - Where No Man Has Gone Before - replaces the stiff Captain Pike with Captain James R. Kirk, played by William Shatner.  Along with Doctors Piper, Elizabeth Dehner (Sally Kellerman), and a pointy-eared alien named Mr. Spock - one of the only cast members to return from the first pilot 'The Cage'.  The rest is history...  the Enterprise explored the barrier at the edge of the galaxy which has the strange effect of boosting the mental powers of those with high latent ESP abilities.  Gary Mitchell (Gary Lockwood - pre-'2001'), and Dr. Dehner are most strongly affected - their mental powers taking on a 'god-like' dimension. Kirk realizes that human jealousy, anger, and weaknesses and god-like powers don't mix well, and schemes to abandon Mitchell on planet Delta Vega.  It climaxes in a fisty-cuffs battle in the desert of Delta Vega, and Kirk's tunic is torn displaying his 1966 network-censor approved 'shaved chest'.  Mitchell and Dehner die, and everyone is strangely at peace with the outcome.  But a TV series that took viewers \\"where no man has gone before\\" was born.  Check it out for yourself!  The Unbox download was painless, and I was able to start watching in no time.
B000H305U0|1.0|The reason is that I feel I need to ask God why this sorry excuses of an album was ever made, let alone accepted as art.  Saying \\"bring the sexy back\\" 900 times and calling that innovation is like saying that singing \\"London London London bridge wanna go down\\" 900 times is art.  Ok for one thing, Sexy back while addictive, is very simple.  But that's not why I don't like this CD.  The song is fine, and actually his best song to date by far.  When I heard it I figured that the CD was going to be fast and furious and made for the dance floor.  I WAS WRONG.  It's slow and long winded.  Most of the songs are over 6 minutes long, and in a bad way.  The beats are exactly the same over and over again.  Repetition must have been Justin's middle name while recording this.  Lyrically it doesn't get much better.  He sings about sexy sexy sexy over and over again but there is ZERO variety in the lyrics.  I mean how many times can one say the word SEXY on one CD?  Well Justin is the gold standard of that topic.  Vocally he is about the same.  His voice is so high pitched that it makes Kylie Minogue sound like a man.  And there are still those spitty beat box wannabe sounds all over this LP.  The best parts of this CD are when Justin is not even singing.  The guest rappers outshine him.  Justin might be trying to bring Sexy Back but maybe next time he should bring something sexy to go along with his bold claim.
0767834739|5.0|I think that I like this movie more than the original, but the original is still great. What is really good about this movie that makes it better than the first movie is the obvious return of characters we know from the video game series. It is great to see Carlos, Jill and the coolest of all, Nemesis in this movie.<br /><br />There are many times in this film that make references to the games. It was fun watching and saying, \\"Oh that was on Code Veronica!\\" for example. The acting was once again really good, but the action and special effects really make this a fun movie to watch. IF you love the first movie, then you should like this one. Especially if you know the series and know the game references that are made.
0446677450|4.0|I read this book several years ago. I was already pretty successful, and this helped me see how I could pass along some of the ideas on being successful to others, without me sounding like I was preaching. <br /> <br />However, I noticed that they were not able to do what Kiyosaki said. They kept finding problems, excuses, reasons why they could not get onto the path to success. These were all signs of internal blocks they could not overcome. <br /> <br />I knew what they meant - I have tried affirmations, the law of attraction stuff, thinking myself rich, etc. All that stuff only works if there is no internal block in the way. If it is there, then you go nowhere. You stay stuck and maybe even think there is something wrong with you. <br /> <br />There is a way to get beyond all this and it is amazingly simple - you fix the self-limiting beliefs and blocks concerning money. But before you book yourself an appointment with a shrink, remember that talk therapy takes a long, long time. You'd be further ahead by checking out Robert Vibert's Missing Link to your Success book series. He explains how many people have become success using techniques like Rich Dad, Poor Dad by removing their internal blocks quickly and easily.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|I love this movie!  I don't normally care for Keanu Reeves, but he did a wonderful job in this movie.  And Sandra Bullock, like always, did a marvelous job as his love interest.  I laughed, I cried (twice), and every girlfriend I took had the same reaction.  My husband hasn't seen it yet, so I'm not sure if it qualifies as a date movie or simply a great chick flick.  Try not to think to hard about the time space continuim thing and you'll be fine. :-)  I ranked this movie as one of my top 5 of this year.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|First off I would like to state that FOX has no CLUE about what shows to keep on the air.  This show should have never been cancelled, and I miss being able to see new episodes.  There was a movie made after this series was taken off the air-which I also enjoyed, but doesnt QUITE mesh up with the series although all the same characters are in the movie which was very nice to see.  If you are a fan of sci-fi and fantasy, you shouldn't be disappointed by this series.
1400082773|5.0|This was a wonderful unsentimental, honest consideration of race and inheritance. Obama is a really good writer and the book reads like a novel. I loved the stories about learning about his family in Africa the most. It was very powerful.
B000GG4KTU|3.0|I'm with the reviewers who have expressed a longing for Diana's smaller band days.  Only Trust Your Heart and Love Scenes are my favorites, as well as Live From Paris. Even on When I Look In Your Eyes, in the midst of all of those orchestral arrangements, there was still a sense of soulfulness to her songs.  The Big Band sound on this CD really undercut what I love most about Diana's voice-- the sultry intimacy of it. <br /> <br />I pre-ordered this CD because Diana's name alone is good enough for me to invest in her projects, but this one felt stunningly empty, like a shell without a core.  But I understand that artists must try any and all things to grow. Some things will resonate with a lot a people, while others won't.  It's all a matter of personal taste.  I will continue to buy Diana's music, but this one was lukewarm for me.
B000HT386M|5.0|I love Adam Sandler movies, almost as much as my husband does.  Our top favorites are Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, 50 First Dates, and now Click.  We saw it in the theater and though it did live up to our expectation laughter wise, I was pleasantly surprised at the touching storyline.  I actually cried!  Yes, I cried at an Adam Sandler movie!  hehehe<br /><br />The lesson at the end of this story is so needed for the world right now.  Slow down!  Appreciate the little things!  Life is too short to skip those little moments.  Thank you Adam for another wonderful addition to our DVD library.  Can't wait till it's released!
B000EHRVP6|1.0|I watched this movie, because a friend of mine told me about it.  But she had told me if it was gore I was looking for, don't bother.  I decided that I'd buy it on OnDemand & see for myself.  She was right.  I wont go into any details of the plot, because it's been done before.  Really the only gore that you see that is worth a grimace is the \\"eye cutting\\" scene.  Later you see her running in front of a train, cause she doesn't want to live like that,(who the hell would?)but you only see the blood flying, no actual body.  That is pretty much the entire movie,(or I should say half of the movie,)only implied gore, & if you are a horror fan, it's nothing you havn't seen millions of times before.  In the ads you see a man with a drill, & then the guy with a gag over his mouth screams.  But that is it.  You see him scream, no blood.  Hell, the guy only tortures him, he survives.  But then he runs in a rampage & shoots many people.  You can see somebody get shot on an episode of CSI for crying out loud.  Oh I forgot, when that friend is being dragged into a room, you see other rooms here peopel ar ebeing tortured, but it happens so fast, you really don't see anything.  There is a scene where another friend is being tortured with the same drill & you do see some of the gore, but then it is quickly moved to just a shot of him screaming.  Later you see the torturer,(if that's a word,)talking to the guy & you see there reflection in a shred of glass.  So, you can guess he's gonna get impaled, but they cut away from it at the last second.  The 1st guy dies, but, as some revierer said, you just see his severed head, not how it happened.  At least in the original Friday the 13th we see a split second of Mrs. Voorhees getting decapitated.  Plus, if you have the DVD collection they show even more in the special features.  Yes, there is a lot of sex,(though I even think that people are implying more than there really is,)but if you have a boyfriend or girlfriend just go have sex with them, rather than paying to see it.  You'll have a much more enjoyable time.
B0000019PA|5.0|Aeroplanes Over the Sea may not be the greatest record of pop music, and it's probably not even the strangest, but it is surely the strangest great record ever made.  In fact, it is so unlike anything I've heard, that I won't even bother comparing it to any other rock or pop music. Both musically and lyrically, Jeff Mangum seems to provide direct access to the unconscious, bypassing all conventional rationality and order.  And it's usually a dark, tortured unconscious, as if someone had two years to script a nightmare and reenact it in amazing, painstaking detail.<br /><br />On first listening, the music seems almost jokey, with sing-song like melodies.  Mangum reminds me of a kid trying to sing, not sure how to end a line, and so going up higher and higher until he gives out.  (Mangum has a certain kinship with Albert Ayler, an underappreciated avant-garde jazz musician.)  And the lyrics, at first, seem surreal to the point of sarcastic parody.  But the more you listen and read, the more you sense the ravaged despair that underlies this record.<br /><br />The first track sets the tone.  King of Carrot Flowers starts with a whimsical evocation of childhood fantasy (\\"When you were young you were the king of carrot flowers\\"), and ends with the family's father dreaming of different ways to kill himself, but too fearful to dare try any.  The \\"king\\" of the carrot flowers becomes Jesus in Part II, one of the few purely comic moments on the record.<br /><br />Implausibly (inexplicably, I would say, except that it works), though, the lyrical content of the record is dominated by Anne Frank, whose diary tortured so many of us in junior high school.  But the Anne Frank of NMH is transformed into some mystical martyr of the collective unconscious.  In fact, despite the caterwauling strangeness, virtually every moment of this record is perfect.  In fact, after listening to it enough times, Aeroplane feels constructed like a Swiss watch, although one that does not tell you the time that anyone else thinks it is.  The only exception is \\"Oh Comely,\\" which feels a bit like a mishmash of ideas (both musical and lyrical) that Mangum had left over, and threw together in one long opus.<br /><br />Despite the Anne Frank theme, the record's emotional core is in Two-Headed Boy (I and II).  Yes, Mangum really is singing to a medical freak, floating in a formaldehyde jar.  And it is downright terrifying.  Terrifying, even if it seems like a joke when Mangum implores the boy to put on Sunday shoes and dance to accordion keys.  In Part II, Mangum starts out by singing to the bereft father of the two-headed boy, and then becomes the father, singing to the medical monstrosity that once was his son.  But, ultimately, I think the two-headed boy is intended to be Mangum himself, whose tortured genius puts him so far outside of the conventional realm that he must feel like some misformed curiosity himself.  At the end of the record, Mangum takes off his guitar and sets it down.  And, apparently, he never picked it up for the public again.
B000ETQRCM|1.0|i've got the first several pearl jam album releases through 'no code'.  this band was just getting worse with every album.  eventually, i caught on and stopped wasting my $.  i read all the great reviews of this album and thought the first single was alright.  who the @$#%@ are these dumb reviewers?  are they getting paybacks?  is this politics or music?  live 105.3 barely played any of this album - and i should have taken a clue from that.  they still know how to play, but need some new energy and ideas to make cohesive, appealing songs.  also, maybe they need to be poor again to lift their spirits - obviously being filthy rich isn't helping!  only put 1 song on my mp3 players...= 1 star.
B000FVQYYK|3.0|Sorry, but does anyone realize Knights of C sounds a lot like Blondie's \\"Call Me\\"? It's a good song, it's just been done before. Listen next time, you will never think of it the same way, trust me.
B00003CXA6|5.0|After the heart-rending nobility of Abraham Lincoln's verbal tribute to Gettysburg's fallen, there is not much else that could do those men justice.<br /><br />Yet GETTYSBURG does so.<br /><br />This 1993 film, second in a civil war trilogy that begins with GODS AND GENERALS and concludes with LAST FULL MEASURE is worlds beyond its predecessor in cinematographic and dramatic prowess. To put it as succinctly as possible, this is a profoundly moving four hours of personalized history.<br /><br />A film like this helps us to recall that we are not yet one hundred fifty years from southeastern Pennyslvania's momentary appearance as a killing field. In America's most costly war, this was its linchpin battle.<br /><br />Tom Berenger and Martin Sheen turn in understated and powerful renderings of Confederate generals. Sheen's Robert E. Lee carries a mountain's weight of burden on his grieving shoulders even as he makes the decisions that will send still more Virginia gentlemen and Texas cowboys to their deaths. Jeff Daniels far outshines his earlier representation of Maine's Coronel Chamberlain, the six-times wounded college professor who would finish his working life as the president of Bowdoin College.<br /><br />The panoramic battle scenes provided legions of Civil War reenactors with their glorious opportunity, one that - with the exception of a handful of volunteers who couldn't help grinning while they were being shot down - seized the day with remarkable poignance.<br /><br />This one is for seeing again and again, remembering, and bowing one's head against the awful fact that nations are too often born in blood.
0385337388|1.0|As a resident, This book clearly gives a wrong account of the lifes/thoughts of most residents/intrens.Very little of the screaming sexuality/irreverence is true especially in this day and age.Patients health are not taken this lightly and profesionalism is key and indeed emphasized.We now know why there was so many successful lawsuits in the 70's and 80's. <br />However I am not surprised knowing the Author is a Psychiatrist and not in the aspect of medicine most people will ever get to see/experience. <br />Psychiatrists tend to think a little bit off the curve. <br />VERY FEW OF THE STORIES, SCENARIOS AND STATEMENTS AS TRUE OR EVEN POSSIBLE IN THIS DAY AND AGE. <br />RECOMMENDATION: Not recommended reading.  <br />
1400079276|5.0|Any book that can hold you on the edge of delighted and confused from the first page to the last is a real treat.  An author who tackles a surrealist plot takes on the challenge of maintaining a convincing atmosphere of being at the border between reality and imagination without ever slipping too far in either direction.  Murakami met the challenge in spades in Kafka on the Shore. <br /> <br />From the very first page of the book you sense having one foot in a world you can't wholly understand and another in the world you do understand.  Murakami maintains the feeling for the length of the book to marvelous effect.  You end up taking a journey with the young Japanese protagonist (Kafka) that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. <br /> <br />As you read the book, you'll notice influences that range from the X-Files to Don Quixote and you'll never want to put it down.  Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys slightly surreal or existential fiction.

B000HA4W4S|4.0|It's a good album.  Having listened to it several times now I feel like it's missing some of the \\"fun\\" bubblyness that was on their fist album.  That doesn't make for a bad album though, it just makes this a different album.  I'm enjoying the music and the repeated listens.  When I allow this album to stand on it's own it's worthy of 4 stars.  (Their debut was 5 stars in my mind.)
B00004NHCC|5.0|Listening to this collaboration between Sarah Vaughan and Clifford Brown (among others) today makes you feel as if time stood still since it was originally recorded in 1954. Vaughan's voice is as crisp now as it will ever be and brings you a sense of what a truly timeless performance is and what art is all about. Packing classic after classic, you hear her perform jazz standards like it is the first time you've heard the songs, such as the case of \\"Lullaby of Birdland\\". Her wide ranging voice will simply never die and will continue to save a place for her in music history as one of the best singers ever.
B000EGCITG|4.0|The CD has a lot of songs on it more than I expected. Seeing that I knew a few songs had to be fillers that just didnt make an impact or left a lasting feeling. I counted three, other than those lackluster songs the CD is pretty good.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|Iron Maiden's fourteenth album is finally here. I currently have eight of their albums. It's safe to assume Iron Maiden has released another quality album. Dickinson's voice is as good as it was twenty-four years ago on the Number of the Beast album. The compositions are very typical of `Iron Maiden', but in a good way. The album is over 70 minutes long, with 10 songs. It is their longest album to date and the band lets their progressive side shine through. Although it is not a concept album, the lyrics deal with war and religion. A lot of the songs aren't very fast, but instead the band concentrates on slower expressive tunes.  <br /> <br /> \\"Different World\\" is a shorter, simpler song, but is a strong opener and has a great solo. It's one of the few fast songs in the album. <br /> <br />\\"These Colours Don't Run\\" has a strong chorus, and has some well-placed strings added in the song, so it resembles a power metal song in parts.  <br /> <br />\\"Brighter Than A Thousand Suns\\" is a heavier song, with some thrashy riffs. It changes mood quite a lot. This song is quite fast paced.  <br /> <br />\\"Pilgrim\\" is a fast, majestic song. There's quite a lot of Middle Eastern inspiration for the melody. It's one of my favourite on the album. The drums and bass are pounding, and the guitars have a mystical feel to them. The vocals are soaring. <br /> <br />\\"The Longest Day\\" is quite mid-paced, with a captivating chorus. At 4.50 there are some interesting varied minor scales. The lyrics describe living through a war. <br /> <br />\\"Out of the Shadows\\" is a metal version of a power ballad. There's a catchy musical part at 3.30. It's not my favourite song on the album, but it's still grand.  <br /> <br />\\"Reincarnation Of Benjamin Breeg\\" is the single of the album. Heavy and thrash-like it is a worthy song. It features some grandiose riffing and singing. <br /> <br /> \\"For the Greater Good of God\\" is a long 9-minute 24 epic masterpiece. (Longest song on the album) As a slower song ithas beautiful melodies and riffs. The music speeds up around the 6.00 mark for an anthem-type solo. Dickinson sings his heart out for the line \\"Please tell me now what life is.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Lord Of Light\\" has a slow start but speeds up eventually. I like the chorus in this, but it sound similar to many other Iron Maiden songs.  <br /> <br />The album ends with \\"The Legacy\\", which starts of acoustically, then an almost military marching beat ensues. This song is mid-paced but gets fast around the middle, with some progressive elements in the music. A great end to the album. <br /> <br />Overall this is a fabulous album. Any Iron Maiden fan should already have this, and any metal fan should GET this!
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I have been a fan of Mayer's music since `Heavier Things', this new album I had the opportunity to listen to it in a first listen that he himself presented at a radio station in a LA a couple weeks before the release date.<br /><br />There are a few things to say about this album, Mayer has done it again and presents us eleven of his greatest compositions ('Bold as love' was left out on purpose since it is a Jimi Hendrix original)<br /><br />The opening song, `Waiting on the world to change' practically announces how the rest of the album will be, if an influence has to be mentioned it is the blues. This is demonstrated in track 9 when Mayer surprises with an excellent cover of `Bold as love', in his own words not a cover but a tribute to Hendrix.<br /><br />Great lyrics are all over the disc, one of my favorites is called `Gravity'. Other highlights are `The heart of life' and `Stop this train', the lyrics on the latter are simply beautiful.<br /><br />The art of the disc is minimalist yet attractive, a great job was done designing it, it is worth the 47 cents per disc Mayer had to pay when he requested the specific design he wanted (this among other things he mentioned in that first listen)<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00004TZU8|5.0|It's also honest-something people avoid if things might get messy.  People cheat-it happens every day.  The lighting, music and slow pacing only accentuate the melacholy mood of the film.  I love depressing movies-music too.  There's no escaping the truth for these characters.  It's painful.  Betrayal always is-eventually.  If you don't like depressing stuff, this movie will turn you off-even if you like the leads.  Pollack's direction is perfect for the material-something I imagine he did on purpose.  This is adult material-it's just that adults don't usually like to deal with difficult issues. <br /> <br />The two weak points of the film are the side story and the romance.  The friendship between the two leads is believable-the romance is not.  However, the film is so dreary that even these two items don't take away from the film's power.  Marrying someone is no guarantee of fidelity.  There is a darkness about humans that lies in their desire to please themselves-even at the cost of hurting the one they love most.  That, and you will never really know the darkest recesses of the one you love 'til they rip your heart out and leave you \\"in the shadow of the light from a black sun\\".
B00008O31H|4.0|A buddy/coworker threw this disk at me and told me I had to listen to it.  Being a huge White Stripes fan, both for their adherence to blues licks and for their \\"medium-fi\\" level of sound and performance quality, he figured I'd dig it, and in fact, I did.  It seemed that although Jack & Meg White often pay homage to Page and Plant, Auerbach and Carney seem to salute Clapton and Baker.  Man!  Heavy hard licks, gritty \\"just rolling into Chicago on Highway 61\\"-style blues. Got the newest on order to see if the Keys have developed some more distinctive riffs (the hardest task in Rock n' Roll!). The Black Keys have it down!

B00005JN0T|5.0|Just because you're paranoid, it doesn't mean they're not out to get you. It's healthy to be suspicious. Never go with the flow. Never compare a movie with a book: they're different animals. This was an interesting film, although there is little doubt that mankind is actually on the high road to dehumanisation. That's why there was no sex, not much gore, only three human deaths, more hardware than software, and why Smith was a quarter robot himself. At one point I thought he was a robot through and through; and might even have been the mastermind behind the whole set-up. But no, it all turned out right in the end. Reassuring for the kids. Good fun, but not very memorable. Five stars for the sfx and the cgi; and Smith was good as Spooner.
B000000W6F|4.0|I am only discovering Gish in 2006 because in the early 90's I was on a self-imposed moratorium from listening to rock music. (long story)  Whether this album sounds dated to some or not, it sure sounds fresh to me! <br /> <br />One thing that stands out is the guitar work on Gish.  It just might be the best (at least as far as soloing is concerned) in the whole Smashing Pumpkins catalog, or what I know of that catalog, up to Adore. <br /> <br />Gish took time to fully sink in for me, but that's a good thing.  I listened to it completely through several times before I started to realize how breathtaking the album was as a whole. <br /> <br />The earlier part of the album has more of the fast, driving, heavy rhythyms.  The only fault here is that some of the songs sound quite a bit alike (\\"I am One\\" compared to \\"Bury Me\\", for example).  But these songs are so tremendous that I can look past the similarity issue.  The album hits the breaks in the middle with Crush and Suffer, two \\"mellow\\" beauties.  Then, it embarks on a small journey toward a tremendous climax through Snail, Tristessa, and Window Paine.  This reminds me of the Talking Heads \\"Remain in Light\\" album, which steadily darkens, finally concluding with the Overload, leaving the listener breathless.  Window Paine has a similar feel, and would have been a perfect ending to Gish.  Daydream closes the album, which I think is a filler...although D'arcy's pseudo-singing over the acoustic guitar is pleasant enough.

B000BNNLN4|2.0|Reviewers who rave about this book must not read much. It isn't a totally uninteresting story but would have been better published as a short story. The blurb from The Times on the book's jacket said \\"Extremely funny\\" but my guess is the complete quote was \\"With this premise, this book should be extremely funny, but it isn't.\\" It was mildly interesting but you could tell it was a first book as the writing was rather clumsy and she repeated herself a lot.  <br /> <br />I do believe the author's attempt to draw an allegory about Russia and the USSR versus the capitalist west was clever but she just didn't pull it off sufficiently to satisfy. <br /> <br />Perhaps my reading of this book suffered most because it followed a reading of Saturday by Ian McEwan, a masterpiece. Don't get me wrong; this book had it's moments but there just weren't enough of them.

B000H6SXMY|5.0|Friends is a great show, so don't get me wrong.  But how many times are the studios and DVD producers going to re-release the same things wrapped in a different package.  If I'm not mistaken, just a little while back a \\"complete\\" set of the Friends show was released in a nice little black box with clear front door showing the \\"Friends\\" on the clear polyurethane cover.  And now they're coming out with another \\"Complete Series Collection.\\"  This is getting ridiculous.  And it's not only happening with the Friends franchise.  Take for example the Lord of the Rings movies, how much \\"extra features\\" does Peter Jackson have with these movies?  I own the Gift Sets and I've seen at least 3 or so other versions of these movies.  I am a DVD collector, so I like to buy the definitive version of each movie when they come out (or special editions like the giftsets of the LoTR trilogy).  So this frustrates me when one thing comes out and then a year later they think that they can pull the wool over the consumers' collective eyes by repackaging the same thing in a new wrapper.  So for the Peter Jackson's, George Lucas', and the many other studios out there, enough is enough.  Make the first one the best one and cut the greed down a little bit.  Thanks. <br /> <br />This review was given a 5 star because the show really deserves the 5 stars.  If it were based on the greed of the studios...then the 0 star would be my vote.
0743298020|5.0|A true gothic novel in the style of the Bronte sisters, Setterfield's debut features a narrator who lives mostly in her imagination, through the books she voraciously devours. Margaret Lea writes occasional short biographies of obscure, long-dead people and helps her father run a quiet, dusty antiquarian bookshop, where most of their time is spent reading. Until the events of this novel, she never read anything more recent than the 19th century.<br /><br />\\"The reason is simple: I prefer proper endings. Marriages and deaths, noble sacrifices and miraculous restorations, tragic separations and unhoped for reunions, great falls and dreams fulfilled; these, in my view, constitute an ending worth the wait.\\"<br /><br />Then, Vida Winter, Britain's most beloved author, a woman with a stubbornly mysterious past, proposes that Margaret hear her story and write her biography. Vida is dying and her loose relationship with \\"the truth\\" has been on her mind. All her life she has used stories to deflect interviewers who'd come armed with some small fact. \\"A good story is always more dazzling than a broken piece of truth.\\"<br /><br />But now the truth is gnawing at her, clamoring to be set free. She has decided on Margaret after reading a biographical piece she wrote on a pair of brothers: \\"Because you know about siblings.\\"<br /><br />Not just siblings, but twins. Margaret was a conjoined twin - when they were separated her twin died, her mother never fully recovered, and Margaret has felt haunted by the loss all her life. When Vida tells her the story begins with twins and ends with a disastrous fire, Margaret is hooked, only insisting on a few facts she can verify before starting.<br /><br />The story arises from the dying woman's vivid tales of generations of Angelfields, each more eccentric and vicious than the one before, and Margaret's research through old records and her explorations of the burned ruins of Angelfield, the family manse. There Margaret meets a man who bodily haunts the ruin, called by his unknown past. He was a foundling, left at a nearby cottage the night of the fire, a baby smelling of smoke.<br /><br />And Vida tells of wild, untamable twins, neglected by their crazed mother and her cruel brother, cared for by a dwindling staff, which is finally whittled down to a devoted housekeeper and a watchful gardener. Outsiders - a doctor and a plain, competent governess - interfere in the twins' lives, nearly destroying them in trying to save them. People die, disappear, are dragged off to lunatic asylums.<br /><br />And it all works. Setterfield is a strong, vibrant writer who calls upon all the romance of the gothic style and weaves an elaborate, dazzling tapestry for the reader. This is a book to sink into and be swept up in, a page-turner of mysteries, hauntings, revelations and secrets, storms and deaths and, finally, truth.

This is the book that just \\"clicked\\" with me.<br /><br />After twenty odd years of seeing people die in hospitals and nursing homes, I never had an inner inkling of, hey, where did you go?  There were never any celestial trumpets, or etheric winds, or voices in my ears saying goodbye. Now I know what you see when you die, I'll be sure to turn my face upwards and give a smile and a wave.<br /><br />Michael Newton gives us a 7000 case study strong argument to say that there is a high level of consciousness after death in the soul state, that the soul \\"life\\" as it were is more richly experiential and real to us than the human state is. He presents 29 case studies but draws from 30 years of regression cases to present common threads of soul life memories, such as how it feels to die, meeting up with your soul group on the \\"other side,\\" the life review (yes, there is karma), how souls choose their next life, and the answer to my most frustrating question in the world - why do babies and children die? The answer to that one could ease your grief and change your outlook on the inhumanity of the world. If it all sounds a bit too fantastic, cross reference with the great books of eastern myth and religion, the Jain and Zoroastrians, Buddhists, Hindus, the Yoga Sutras, Bhagavad Gita and Tibetan book of the Dead.

B000GPIPSS|5.0|This is the third time that Universal has released the original Dracula on DVD.  The first and second releases had problems.  Both prior releases had unsatisfactory, murky and dark picture quality.  There was no fine detail and objects got lost in the murkiness of the image.  Also the shots of the newspaper clippings following the landing of the Vesta were off-center and cut off.   The first release had a clean sounding, almost hissless soundtrack but was missing music at the end of the scene in the opera house following the line, \\"There are far worse things awaiting man...than death.\\"  The second release restored that music but cut out the screams of Renfield and the dying groans of Dracula at the end of the film.  The second release also had hiss issues with the sound quality. <br /> <br />This third release, the 75th Anniversary release (which also coincides with the 50th anniversary of Bela Lugosi's death on August 16, 1956), has vastly improved picture quality.  The image is now bright and full of detail.  It looks like a new movie!  The murkiness is gone.  There are numerous shades of grey instead of the prior high contrast image.  The image is almost as clean and clear as that of the Spanish language version which is also included on disc 2.  Also, the shots of the newspaper clippings are now perfectly centered and fully legible for the first time on DVD!  My one complaint with the picture is that if you compare this release to the prior releases it appears that the edges of the image are now slightly cropped on all four sides of the frame.  This is almost unnoticeable except for the initial shot of Dracula's coffin.  In the prior 2 releases, when the camera dollies into the coffin and you first see Dracula's hand emerge from the coffin, you see the pillar or base of the arch to the left of the coffin for most of the shot.  In this third release, for some unknown reason, the left side of this shot has been severely cropped; the pillar is almost entirely missing from the shot leaving the composition totally off balance.  This is the only time where the cropping is excessive and disruptive to the image.  In all the other shots in the film, the cropping of the edges of the image is minor and actually appears to center the image better than the prior 2 releases.  Unless you have seen this movie numerous times, you will not even notice it.   <br /> <br />The third release completely restores all of the missing sound elements - music, screams and groans, but the hiss has returned and the sound is not as clean as the first version. <br /> <br />If you already own the first 2 releases, it is worth buying this version for the improved picture quality alone!  I highly recommend this version as the one to buy! <br /> <br />Bela Lugosi lives!
B000G759LW|5.0|It becomes apparent that the reviews are not motivated by constructive musicial critisim, but more so by racial slander and pop culture hatred. As someone who was raised on the greats and have respect for most of todays artists, I do not understand the attempts to debunk the different approach taken behind this album. Most artists today dont even have the audacity to attempt a 'career suicide' like this and show their true appreciation for music. Instead, they stick within the modern day mainframe, trying to produce successful hits and never step outside of their comfort zone or the business framework. This is not to discredit anyone like Beyonce, Mariah Carey, Toni Braxton, Whitney Houston or Janet Jackson, but the truth of the matter is as great a potental they once had, it hasnt really shone of their recent efforts. What you get instead is true potental concealed behind a marketing fueled attempt to stay in the game by playing off the dirty south hip hop style and simple R&B productions designed to make every song a radio hit. I think some of you play into their past legacy and continute to support them like they are willing to push the envelope, when the truth is they dont. Their great singers, but they dont do anything with that greatness. <br /> <br />As for Christina, I did not like her until I heard this album. A artist who I really did not give enough attention to flipped me upside down with this latest album. Now some of you might say she is a pop artists and doesnt have the ability to do other kinds of music, and to that I say maybe you didnt study the graduating class of Mickey Mouse enough. Out of everyone from there she has shown the most potental and the most creative talent. It certainly helps this album is back by musicial genuises like Linda Perry (whose second cd, while all over the place, should be given credit for the insame amount of work required to construct and record songs with the kind of arrangement and equipment she did use), DJ Premier(who while overseeing the first cd, did only FIVE TRACKS...you dumbasses should read the notes sometimes), and Mark Ronson. While all of them deserve credit for being the minds behind the music, this is Christina's album and her style comes to shine on here. As her past albums have shown, she is not the soft singing type and likes to sing upward with the beat. While it can be said on a few songs she might oversing where she doesnt need to, she shows some constraint on several songs, the second cd especially. The pop influce she brings on the 90s style hip hop and R&B songs on here does work, and actually sounds refreshing. As for the name dropping, she has said before she would like to see in the same vein as them and wants a legacy like Madonna. While this is a admirable career goal, only time will tell if she merely did this to gain the attention of some or if she feels she can really pusure this goal with multi-platinum status under her belt from her earlier compromises. But as it stands, this is a refreshing stroke of musicial genius that invokes the past while maintaining a present day flavor, all while bearing her \\"Dirty\\" style.
0060005696|5.0|Having a choice in life is a good thing; a person without choices is often miserable.  As the number of choices grows, our happiness grows with them, but then it begins to decline.  Having too many choices creates stress.  Schwartz describes his visit to a local supermarket: \\"...next to the crackers were 285 varieties of cookies.  Among chocolate chip cookies there were 21 options. ... Across the isle were juices - 13 `sports drinks,' 65 `box drinks' for kids, 85 other flavors and brands of juices, and 75 iced teas and adult drinks.  I could get these tea drinks sweetened (sugar or artificial sweetener), lemoned, and flavored. ... I found 61 varieties of suntan oil and sunblock, and 80 different pain relievers - aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen; 350 milligrams or 500 milligrams; caplets, capsules, and tablets; coated or uncoated.  There were 40 options for toothpaste, 150 lipsticks, 75 eyeliners, and 90 colors of nail polish from one brand alone.\\"<br /><br />Those wide choices may seem appealing, but Schwartz brings our attention to what he calls `the darker side of freedom' - the stress of choice.  This paradox is the most pronounced in the financial markets.  Even though his book is about the paradox of choice in general, I read it with an eye towards the financial markets, my own trading, and what I see in other traders.<br /><br />Shall we trade stocks, futures, or options?  If stocks, shall we trade the more seasoned issues on the NYSE or look for riskier high-growth candidates on the NASDAQ?  Should we track agricultural, tropical, or financial futures?  And what about the forex?  Should we buy or write options, or look into more complex strategies, such as spreads?  And worst of all - what if another market makes a spectacular move while our attention is focused elsewhere?  No wonder the majority of traders feel so stressed.  Schwartz says \\"Choosing almost always involves giving up something else of value.  ... The overload of choice contributes to dissatisfaction.\\"<br /><br />\\"Losses hurt more than gains satisfy.  ... The cost of any option involves passing up the opportunities that a different option would have afforded.  ... Conflict induces people to avoid decisions.  ...Emotional unpleasantness makes for bad decisions.  ... The desire to avoid regret leads to inaction inertia.  ... An overload of choice contributes to dissatisfaction.\\"<br /><br />Every trader who kicked himself after a profitable trade for having `left more money on the table' will chuckle at a cartoon of a kid in a t-shirt that says \\"Brown ... but my first choice was Yale.\\"  Schwartz shows how people are divided into `maximizers' who always strive for the best and `satisficers' those who settle for some reasonable level of success.  \\"Almost everyone who scores high on maximization scale also scores high on regret.\\"  You can decide to be a maximizer in a very small number of situations that truly matter to you and be a more mellow satisficer in the rest of your life.  \\"We would be better off seeking what was good enough instead of seeking the best.\\"<br /><br />Connections with trading kept running through my mind while reading this book.  How many successful people kick themselves, feeling that their performance was not good enough.  How many stay way too long in a bad trade because of `sunk costs.'  Schwartz exposes the endless flow of coulda-shoulda-woulda as `counterfactual thinking.'  He shows how keeping records of decisions impacts people's attitudes towards those decisions.  I have been saying over and again that keeping good records is the single most important step towards becoming a successful trader.<br /><br />The tone of Professor Schwartz's book is that of a friendly, intelligent neighbor, dealing with the same human dilemmas as you and I.  He shares his thinking about our problems by talking with us, not at us.  His compact and smoothly written book sheds light on many aspects of decision-making, the stress of `roads not taken,' thecurse of high expectations, etc.<br /><br />The mere fact of outlining a problem is a big step towards clarity, but after 10 chapters, I felt ready to hear about his proposed solutions.  They were delivered in Chapter 11 (which I hope had nothing to do with the eponymous chapter of the bankruptcy code :-)).  Professor Schwartz's advice was lucid, logical, and sensible - but you will have to read it yourself (I do not describe it here because reciting solutions without having worked through the problems is likely not to be useful.)<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to all traders.  My only quibble is the paper quality of the paperback - it is grayish, and should have been much whiter!

0618680004|1.0|Has Dawkins ever heard of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the Khmer Rouge,or German National Socialism? These entities and movements carried out the most extensive atrocities, genocides, and widespread abrogations of human rights that the world has ever seen. What they have in common is an atheist ideology and a malevolent hatred of religions, religious beliefs, and the ethnicities associated with religions. <br />With these simple reminders, perhaps Mr. Dawkins can understand the eye-rolling elicited by his vast and self-congratulatory ellipses of history. <br /> <br />In particular, Dawkins attempt to make Hitler into a Christian is a sad and disingenuous place for a scientist to put himself---especially a scientist of history---since Hitler's hatred of Christianity, the German churches and the clergy is so amply documented. He also claims that atheists do not kill people in the name of atheism. OF course, this is manifestly not true of Stalin. It is also manifestly not true in China. Does imprisonment and torture count? Do historical misrepresentation and slander count? (Dawkins himself does that in the name of atheism. Most violence actually starts with a verbal fight, and it's usually not about religion.) <br /> <br />The problem with the world isn't religious belief, it's belief: including Dawkins'. You see things your way, and I see them my way, and under the right circumstances, that becomes war. The idea that people will all suddenly agree with each other once religion is eliminated is so churlish and stupid I can't imagine how a person with Dawkins apparent (!) intellect could suggest it. And really, it is people like Dawkins--those (religious and secular alike) <br />who are constantly hurling invective and hyperbole and specious arguments to denigrate the views of others--who add to the strife and conflict in the world.  <br /> <br />Virtually every atheist regime that has ever existed failed to respect human freedom; you're not allowedto disagree with them, because they have figured out what is best for everyone and every time. You can see how Dawkins is well-qualified for an official role as propagandist for one of these regimes. He fails to see that, alas, people are going to continue to choose what they will do and believe. That is a fact, and, as a scientist, you'd think he want to try to understand it, rather than to explain it, and centuries of moral philosophy, away with manifestly unsatisfactory theories.
B0000025DV|5.0|Personally the Amazon employee Steve Gdula is a bit lopsided in tanking this album.  Saying that power Cello can only go so far is like saying that Garth Brooks' Guitar can only go so far.  Each band has a sound, you either appreciate it or you don't.  Rating a band by how much they sound like themselves or not makes absolutely no sense for people looking at these ratings for a specific sound they desire.  Hey Nat King Cole, Baritone vocals only go so far.. come on Steve.    Anyhow that being said, a FAIR portrayal of this album would be to rate it based on previous and future albums by THIS BAND.  If you don't know E.L.O. then this album would be a great way to introduce yourself to their sound.  It was written at their peak of fame and has a good range of what they sound like.  If you are a fan then you pretty much already know this album.  Another poster mentioned A new world record being their best, that is probably true. Tightrope is probably their single best song if you were forced to pick one. Out of the blue offers plenty of tracks and a very polished master thanks to studio advancements. Steve, personally this is an excellent album as it contains very few if any tracks that you would be tempted to skip.

B000008I4Z|5.0|Concept albums are curse words to the music world today. Or so they say. Most people would say who cares, as long as the album is good. Well, Brave is not good, it is a total MASTERPIECE. The album will make rock, make you think, and make you cry. The whole album is a storyline about a girl with a rough childhood and attempts suicide. The music of the album fits the lyrics like a glove. This is lyrically Marillion's best work. Put your headphones on and listen to this with lyric booklet in front of you. Listen to the stand outs like the pulsating rocker Hard as love (definitly a song to get your frustrations out.), to the beauty and fanfare of the song Great Escape, and the beauty of Made Again, along with the other great songs on this album. you will be hooked onthis album after the first listen.

B000FZETIO|4.0|4.5 stars for this release, I am sorry they didn't have the actual orginal ending as it seems to say it does on the packaging, bod form DVD producers. <br />BUT I am NOT one of those rabid Duckie fanatics that seem to think that even though Andie and Duckie had NO chemistry that they belonged together. Obviously she loved him as a brother not a potential love interest to do a 180 at least in this film just wouldn't work! If you want that ending go see Some Kind of Wonderful that has that ending AND the two leads have the obvious chemistry AND the story supports the change! <br />People people people, the entire film is supposed to be about the fact that the labels folks put on you are wrong and that no matter what side of the tracks you live on you can still be a good person. <br />But all I hear is complaints about how Duckie didn't get the girl. Well folks I've never in the twenty years that I have adored this film thought he should have and am glad they have not done a Lucas and changed the film to reflect that. I would have like to have seen the scene however and that is why this DVD gets 4.5 stars instead of 5.

B000001GF9|5.0|I can't add much to Mr. Grabowski's praise for this CD. I join Mozart in being no grat lover of church music, but Bernstein's intense, fervent approach is deeply satisfying. He's bucking historical trends, of course, by being so openly devout in an era when period-style readings tend to be drained of reverence. But this reading isn't loggy, and I'd wager it will stand up for a long time. In the fillwer of Exsultate Jubilate, Auger is technically splendid, ad if she shows a bit of effort in the coloratura, it adds to the emotion. The best thing is Bernstein's conducting--it's the best I've ever heard, though again quite traditional. In all, an overlooked gem in LB's vast catalog.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Black Holes and Revelations is by far Muse's most eclectic album to date. It's nothing like what they've done before...Actually, they've never really repeated themselves from album to album. There is definately a more synth feel to the album. It's Prince meets Depeche Mode meets Queen meets Jimmy Page all rolled up in one beautiful album. Their crowning glory is Knights of Cydonia, which is epic and unlike anything I've ever heard. These guys really took a chance with this album. It may not be as commercial as Absolution but props to them for sticking to their guns on this one.
B00000J9HF|4.0|This Rigoletto from Vienna was a prestige recording for DG, featuring the undeniably great Giulini. In his early years at La Scala, Giulini was a riveting opera conductor, but in his later phase he became more serious and is distinctly a sober sides here. There's no birancy or lift to the music, and the avoidance of all vulgarity drains the melodrama of its fun. If there was ever a Rigoletto performed in church, this is it.<br /><br />Even so, the playing and singing are lovely. Cotrubas and Domingo aren't allowed to really cut loose, but they have charisma. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the lead, Piero Cuppuccilli, who was the standard go-to baritone at this time. Smooth-voied and reliable, Cappuccilli doesn't pass muster in the one department that counts in a great Rigoletto, the ability to stir us emotionally. Better to stick with Tito Gobbi in his classic mono set with Callas (EMI) or even Sherrill Milnes with Sutherland and Pavarotti, who isn't remotely Italian but has a great huge voice.
B000031XBQ|4.0|ABBA in the seventies was a musical juggernaut sweeping the top 40 of mostly all international markets. South/Latin America though was not one of these markets. So ABBA decided then to re-release their songs in Spanish. The result was a smashing success that created a loyal fan base.<br /><br />While Fernando, Chiquitita, and Mamma Mia translated quite fine, their version of \\"Conociendome, Conociendote\\" or \\"Knowing Me, Knowing You\\" was a little tougher, but still sounds good. Hasta Manana and Andante, Andante are two very pleasant and personal songs that hit that nerve previous hits accomplished. Even to the untrained Spanish speaker, Agnetha and Frida still sound very well.
B000001GXL|5.0|From the moment he apeared on the scene after WW II, through periods of great acclaim, retirement, re-emergence, notorious cancellations, and final deification, Michelangeli created an aura around himself. He was so aloof, patrician, and unapproachable that audiences felt privileged if he even showed up--and then there was his demand for strict silence and a darkened hall before he would play the first note.  Remembering all that is easy thanks to these magisterial readings of the Beethoven First and Third concertos.<br /><br />Late in his career, Michelangeli found a soul mate in Giulini, both committed to old-fashioned, intense, personal musicmaking. The First concerto starts off broadly, and one imagines this will be an exercise in patience, but the minute Michelangeli enters, you can't help but be riveted. It's not that he employs fireworks a la Horowitz--if anything, the playing is fairly relaxed. It's all in the pianist's total command of each note, thanks to his legendary touch. The simplest scale is completely captivating. (It was a regular habit of Michelangeli's to choose 'simple' music like this concerto, which even a good student can manage, just to hypnotize the audience with his artistry.)<br /><br />The Third concerto is cut form the same cloth. It's soulful, reticent, and deeply felt. Since the keyboard writing is more difficult in this work, we get to hear the magic he could pull off in terms of balance and tone. I don't know how many listeners exist for this kind of music-making, but I'm very grateful that it has been preserved on records.

6304712944|1.0|Camelot was a Broadway hit in 1960 and defined the era when John F Kennedy was president.  Its original Broadway cast was the stuff of legend:  Richard Burton as Arthur, Julie Andrews as his queen, Guinevere, and Robert Goulet as the dashing Sir Lancelot.  With a score by Lerner and Loewe it remains a musical treasure that is often revived. <br /> <br />In 1967, Warner Bros released the film version.  The result was one of the most disappointing adaptations of all time, a long, long, long film that is difficult to watch through in one sitting.  Much of the blame for this must be given to director Joshua Logan who made few films and helped botch another screen adaptation of a classic Broadway musical when he made the film version of \\"South Pacific.\\" <br /> <br />The casting of the film was also lacklustre.  Richard Harris comes off best as Arthur though he's no Burton.  Burton would have been too old to play the role on film but his greatness as a film and stage actor is something that can not be denied and he remains in a class apart from Harris.  Vanessa Redgrave as Guinevere is for me a disappointment.  I find it hard to imagine her as a queen at all for she lacks the regal bearing and elegance needed to play this queen of legend.  Her singing is acceptable given you have never heard Julie in this score.  Julie brought the right amount of natural elegance to the role while still being mischievous, flirtatious and sly when needed before becoming a woman who creates a major problem for herself by loving two men.  Her singing of \\"The Simple Joys Of Maidenhood\\" and \\"The Lusty Month Of May\\" are comic and vocal delights while \\"I Loved You Once In Silence\\" is heartbreaking.  Redgrave does not come close in matching Julie's talent as singer and actress.  Franco Nero is a handsome Lancelot but it's hard in 2006 to accept movies where the actor's singing has been dubbed as his is for this film. <br /> <br />My advice:  if you have an afternoon and evening to kill watch thisbut be warned it's pretty hard going.  If you want to hear this classic score at its best try the Broadway cast recording.  There are also excerpts that were filmed for \\"The Ed Sullivan Show\\" back in 1960 with the original cast that are available on DVD.  They give an inkling into what this film might have been like with the right director and cast.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Richard Armitage, who plays the enigmatic mill owner John Thornton, gives fellow Brit Colin Firth a run for his money in terms of great acting and yes, the hottness factor. Speaking of Colin Firth associations, the proposal scene is reminiscent of Darcy and Elizabeth in terms of misunderstandings and unjust, preconceived opinons.  It seems that from the moment of her refusal, Margaret is thereafter interested in and (subconsciously) attracted to this self-made man.<br /><br />  I thought the relationship between John and his mother particularly beautiful.  Yes, Mrs. Thorton had a harsh opinion of Margaret Hale, but that was mostly out of her desire to protect her son from Margaret's romantic rejection.  Mrs. Thorton said that a mother's love will outlast every other type of love, and she believed in her son and knew he'd take care of her even after his prospects had changed.  (Fortunately, Margaret's (contrived) business proposal would get the mill up and running again.)<br /><br />  This movie (based on Elizabeth Gaskell's novel) allowed for all points of view--we saw too close for comfort the plight of the mill workers who'd soon strike: some of them lived in constant fear of starvation, while others contracted consumption because of unhealthy working conditions and died well before their time.  We also see child labor and how it was normalized at this point in time.  Yet John Thorton, our romantic hero and the proprietor of one of the three or four cotton mills in Milton, is not without compassion or principles.  However, the interests and perspectives of the mill owners and workers were at cross-purposes. Mr. Thorton and the other mill owners discussed concerns about the impending strike, whether they should seek cheaper suppliers outside of England, and whether they should recruit Irish workers to fill in for the strikers.  Margaret's dad, a displaced parson (he had qualms about the mandatory role of the Book of Common Prayer in the Anglican Church) offered spiritual advice to the mill owners, but I don't think his well-intentioned interjections were much heeded. However, he observed that when he heard reasoned arguments from both sides of the dilemna, he could understand both points of view, and therefore, he recommended that both parties (mill owners and striking workers) have open dialogues.<br /><br />  Mr. Thorton became Rev. Hale's pupil, and the two of them tackled Plato and other monumental works.  Mr. Thorton's education was interrupted when he was forced to leave school at 16 and take care of his mother and younger sister while repaying his deceased father's debts from speculation.<br /><br />  The role of Fanny, John's younger sister, seemed one-dimensional and stereotypical.  She seemed to have forgotten that she and her family were impoverished not too long ago b/f her brother's Horatio Alger rags-to-riches turnaround. The mother was far more connected to the family's source of income and purposely lived close to her son's mill and even supervised some of the workers.  She was beaming with pride over her son's accomplishments, yet she forgot how to see from the layman's perspective.<br /><br />  Elizabeth Gaskell wrote with a great social conscience. Yet she also wrote with a great romantic imagination. That two people who seem so different would come to fall in love and be willing to revise their faulty perceptions and grow and change is sight for sore eyes.  My favorite scene from this movie is the last scene at the train station where John and Margaret \\"publicly display their affections\\" (a bit risque for the Victorian era) after Margaret nervously proposed her \\"business plan\\" to save the mill. I don't think John's thoughts could have been further from the mill as he kissed and embraced Margaret.

B000GFLE86|3.0|Compared to everything else out there at the moment, I suppose this is not a bad CD but after \\"Careless Love\\", (which I thought was shockingly brilliant), I find it a bit of a let down. The songs sound somehow dull, unengaging, disjointed, incoherent. Not even the guest appearance by k.d. lang, (whom I happen to really like), manages to alter my view. The overall impression I get is of a project that was done in a hurry and in a rather throwaway and nonchalant manner. And whereas before, I wasn't really bothered as to whether Peyroux was a woman who just happened to have a voice that sounded like Billie Holiday's or whether she was deliberately setting out to model herself on her, I am bothered now. I'm still not sure which is which but I'm bothered, simply because the music feels so flimsy, her voice becomes the main or only focus. And hard though she may be trying, she'll never be able to match Holiday's pathos. Billie didn't just sound the way she did by accident. She sounded that way as a result of the tumultuous, substance-fuelled and angst-ridden life she had.<br /><br />I dunno. Maybe it'll grow on me. Maybe I'm just in the wrong frame of mind. Whatever. I guess it's okay in a playing-it-in-the-background-in-Starbucks kind of way but that's really it. It seems, like as is the case with most music, the best way to get anything of quality these days is to go back into the archives. With that in mind, I'd recommend either go get the real thing or, if you've already got all Billie Holiday's albums, try someone else like Dinah Washington, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughn, Bessie Smith or even Nancy Wilson.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this CD and I was so looking forward to it. Sorry I can't be more positive.
B000F0UV0E|3.0|Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris make sense together.  Simply put, her clear voice provides a wonderful counterpoint to his gravelly rumbling and masterful guitar.  And, both have had a pretty good track record of successful cross-over songs (and sometimes albums) outside their own rock and country genres, respectively.    A few songs on this album live up to that promise: \\"All the Roadrunning\\" and \\"If this is Goodbye\\" both offer something special, and match the talent of these two artists with the kinds of words and music that they were meant to sing.    Other songs don't quite rise to this level of quality:  foremost in my mind is the mind-numbing \\"Red Staggerwing,\\" an odd quasi-love song that sounds like someone with a strange airplane fixation tried to re-write \\"If I Were a Carpenter.\\"  This song is best left unwritten, and unsung.    \\"This is Us\\" has the folksy back-and-forth charm of one of many Carter/Cash he said-she said duets.  And, while the words aren't bad, and paint a nice picture of a mid-life couple looking through old pictures, it's a bit too up-tempo for the subject matter... like one of today's pop-tarts doing a cover of \\"The Way You Look Tonight.\\"      In sum: if you've got an mp3 player, I highly recommend downloading the last two songs.  Otherwise, invest elsewhere.
B000002LJA|5.0|The 80s were a very busy decade for Quincy Jones. Between 1979 and 1989 he not only produced three hit albums for Michael Jackson, he also produced hit albums for others, including George Benson, Donna Summer, James Ingram, Patti Austin, The Brothers Johnson, Rufus & Chaka Khan and Ernie Watts. In his 1990 documentary \\"Listen Up\\", which documents a lot of the making of this particular album, Jones tells of how overwork and exhaustion ultimately led to a nervous breakdown and two separate aneurysms.<br /><br />By the time he was ready to make this album, which he describes as his project of a lifetime, music was undergoing a revolution. Disco was long dead and buried, hip-hop was emerging as the predominant force and the smooth jazz-influenced beats Jones was reputed for were falling out of favour.<br /><br />To give him his due he approached the situation gamely. The title tune, \\"Back On The Block\\" was a brave kiss with rap if not a particularly wise one. The song, which features big guns of the time such as Melle Mel, Big Daddy Kane, Ice-T and Kool Moe Dee is always fun to listen to but I never heard it played on the radio or at any clubs or parties. \\"Jazz Corner of The World\\", his attempt to marry rap with jazz was more interesting and featured jazz luminaries like James Moody, Miles Davis, George Benson, Sarah Vaughn, Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald and Josef Zawinul alongside Kool Moe Dee and Big Daddy Kane. It's heady, exciting stuff to listen to even now, 17 years later. If nothing else, Q certainly knew where music was heading.<br /><br />The production on this CD is stunning beyond belief. \\"Wee B. Dooinit\\", featuring Siedah Garrett, Bobby McFerrin, Al Jarreau, Ella Fitzgerald, Take 6 and Sarah Vaughn is a completely acapella performance. McFerrin produced the percussion and bass sound effects and I still wonder exactly where Q placed the microphones.<br /><br />There are some other great songs. \\"I'll Be Good To You\\" featured lead vocals by Ray Charles and Chaka Khan. The album version was good enough but I remember getting the 12\\" single which had the same backbeat as Soul II Soul's \\"Keep On Movin'\\". (Now THAT was a huge club hit). \\"The Places You Find Love\\" featured lead vocals from Chaka Khan and Siedah Garrett, with background vocals from Howard Hewitt, Jennifer Holiday, James Ingram, Dionne Warwick, Luther Vandross and the Andrae Crouch Singers among others.<br /><br />Apart from her brief stint with the Brand New Heavies, Siedah Garrett's work with Quincy Jones (here and on Michael Jackson's \\"Bad\\") have produced the only performances of hers I've managed to find bearable. She seems to have taken the place formerly occupied by Patti Austin in Q's workplan and to give her the credit she's due, she does the job well. She does the vocal arrangement on the majority of the songs and where she took lead vocal duties, like on \\"I Don't Go For That\\" and \\"One Man Woman\\", she gives a barnstorming performance.<br /><br />But for me, the album was made by \\"Setembro (Brazilian Wedding Song)\\" featuring Take 6 & Sarah Vaughn, with Gerald Albright on alto sax, George Benson on guitar, George Duke on fender Rhodes and Herbie Hancock on keyboards. The song attained iconic status when John Singleton used it in his classic movie \\"Boyz N The Hood\\". (It was the song playing during the love scene between Nia Long and Cuba Gooding, Jr). It's one of the most beautiful pieces of music I've ever heard. Q's take on Joe Zawinul's \\"Birdland\\" featuring Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughn, George Benson, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis and James Moody, is also a personal favourite.<br /><br />This album is also noted for introducing the world to (the then angelic-voiced) Tevin Campbell. He did the tearjerking \\"Tomorrow (Better You, Better Me)\\" with background vocal help from the `children's choir'. And last but by no means least, the album also produced the perennial slow dance song, \\"The Secret Garden\\", featuring El DeBarge, James Ingram, Al B. Sure! andBarry White. That one still moves people to this day.<br /><br />This review is long but I feel to pass this project off with a few lines or a paragraph or two would not be doing its magnitude justice. It's not my all-time favourite Quincy Jones record but I can totally see why he considers it so significant. It is so significant. Getting all these legends of the past and of the future was a huge achievement all by itself. Who else could possibly have gotten all these people into the studio at the same time?Al B.

B000GPIPVU|5.0|My local indie station has been playing \\"Three More Days\\" for a while. I  finally decided to listen to the whole album this morning and I'm stunned by it.  Ray's songs have always had a dreamy quality because of his voice.  This time, he pairs it with amazingly beautiful arrangements.  The first two songs are prime examples of that. <br /> <br />The song \\"Can I Stay\\" is the opposite -- bare bones and very soft.  The lyrics are the scene stealer here.  He truly captures the moment on this one. <br /> <br />This album is excellent through and through.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|Movie: Oh, where to begin? There are so many words that can be used to decribe \\"Star Wars\\" - classic, astounding, remarkable, wonderful, awe-inspiring, ground-breaking, all these words do not even begin to sum up my love for \\"Star Wars.\\" I have had the immense honor of seeing the original trilogy not only in theatres (albeit the \\"special editons,\\" but the Death Star battle looks amazing in a movie theatre!) but countless times on video as well. This movie pretty much ties with \\"The Wizard Of Oz\\" and \\"Beauty And The Beast\\" as the movies I have seen WAY more times than any others. This DVD release is particularly exciting, seeing as it contains the original version that I first saw as a kid. When the specifications of the disc were announced I was admittedly dissappointed, but they were not enough to stop me from buying them. Being skeptical due to the lack of anamorphic enhancement, I went in expecting the worst. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. The transfer was very pleasing, and all the feelings of nostalgia came roaring back. This is the \\"Star Wars\\" I remember, and I will never have to watch the \\"Special Editions\\" again. Now, having purchased the 2004 trilogy release, I simply replaced those discs with the new release, but decided to keep the nice trilogy box as well as the outstanding bonus disc. All in all, I am really happy with my purchase, and I do recommend this DVD. <br /> <br />Video: As everyone knows, the \\"Special Edition\\" looks great. But I seriously doubt anyone is buying this for the \\"Special Edition,\\" so lets see how the original version looks. The disc is presented in 2.35:1 non-anamorphic widescreen. Upon watching the movie, I was really impressed with this transfer. Having all my old VHS tapes as well as the laserdisc version to draw back on, the DVD is lightyears beyond the VHS and laserdiscs. On my standard definition TV, the movie looked great (The TV has a 16:9 feature and can rival the best widescreen and LCD TV sets). I put this disc through the wringer by watching bits and pieces on my high resolution computer. Even with the increased resolution, the disc still looked very good. While anamophic enhancement would have been nice, there are no complanits here. This is far better than what I was expecting. (4/5) <br /> <br />Audio: This is definately one of the best Dolby 2.0 tracks I've ever heard. In Pro-Logic II, this track can rival Dolby 5.1, and in some ways is better than the 5.1 EX mix found on the \\"Special Edition.\\" One scene where the audio is defiantely better is the scene between Grand Moff Tarkin and Princess Leia, where the Death Star destroys Alderaan. On the \\"Special Editon,\\" the dialogue varied in pitch, and got quite distracting. Here, the dialogue remains the same pitch throughout the scene. The attack on the Death Star is where the track really shines. Overall, very impressive for a 2.0 mix. (4/5) <br /> <br />Extras: On disc one, there is the commentary that first appeared on the 2004 release. Its still a good commentary, but nothing new. On disc two which containsa the original version, there is a trailer for the \\"Star Wars Lego Game,\\" as well as a game demo. Not terribly interesting. (2/5) <br /> <br />Overall: Many have complained about this release, but I have really nothing negative to say. It was better than I expected, and I am sure glad I purchased this DVD. Recommended! (4/5) The five star review rating is for the movie.
B000003TAW|5.0|Definitely one of the best albums there is. Every song is great, Say it aint so is a favorite, as well as The world has turned. I recommend this album to anyone aspiring to buy a weezer album, the BLUE album should be a first pick.
B000FS9FCQ|2.0|Original, thought-provoking and daring were just some of the words from other viewers that lured me into seeing this self-adoring film.<br /><br />So lets explore these ideas(and, in keeping with the movie, you can hate ME for this review but my IDEAS are bullet-proof!!!Muwahaha!).....<br /><br />1) Original<br /><br />PAlease. Granted, the first twenty minutes I got kinda excited, hoping to see a clever script full of witty alliterations and matrix-like fight scenes but, looooooooong siiiiiiiiiiigh, I was greatly deceived. I conitinued to watch in dismay as the plot frolicked into the land of  I'm Trying So Hard Not To But I'm Just Like Every Other Film and the script happily  meandered into Chock-Full of Cliches and Loving It region. There's a violent murderer who really has a heart of gold and he wears a mask because he's scarred but holds beauty beyond the physical. He happens to be in the area to rescue a girl who happens to be beautiful and happens to work for the TV station he commandeers and happens to have a past full of rebellion. Yaaaaawn. Good thing no one believes in coincedence or else it would have been REALLY cheesy(winkwink). Of course we also have villians with 0 depth, corrupt clergy and politicians, oppressed minorities and a people rallying, sacrifical, bloody, huge explosion filled, staggering-to-the-one-you-love-just-to-be-able-to-utter-the-perfect-last-words ending. Are you asleep yet?<br /><br />Original? A+ for effort, F for execution.<br /><br />2) Thought Provoking<br /><br />First, I will admit that V had several lines that made me smile or ponder a moment. But after his ridiculous usage of torture - the very thing that embittered him into his mission!!! - he rather lost all credibility to me. While V loathes the murderous society he lives in who kills people they don't approve of, he pracitces the same thing, killing those he doesn't approve of. He is different from them only in his opinion of what is right and wrong. He still enforces it in the same way they do - brute force. Its this character that the movie asks you to root for and beleive in... I just didn't buy it, but obviously, judging from its top of the box office 26.1million dollar opening, most everybody else did.<br /><br />Thought Provoking? Provoked me to just enough thought to write this review and then banish it from my mind forever.<br /><br />3) Daring<br /><br />So it \\"dared\\" to ask the questions, \\"What if another moraly fanatic control freak Hitler-type took over the world?\\"  and \\"What if we were in a supremely controlled world where our every move was monitored by the government?\\" I would say \\"daring\\" would mean if its a topic movie makers shy away from. Hardly. Just to name a few: The Manchurian Candidate, Gattaca, A.I., The Final Cut, Minority Report and of course, the Matrix Trilogy all explore this idea.<br /><br />Also, the whole thing was blown so out of proportion that it succeeded in paralleling no one. It was far too extreme to be daring. It took some things conservatives believe and blew it up so much that only a handful of people could actually relate. It pretended to be \\"in your face\\" with the truth but, honestly, no one seemed to take it personally but simply nodded thinking it was addressing \\"someone else\\". This is called the SECRET SAFE ROUTE - make yourself look like you're willing to say anything while offended a maximum of 1% of the population.<br /><br />Daring? Close but no cigar.<br /><br />Ok, so the total of the above is a big whopping F. However, there were a couple things that inched it up to a C- on my scale.<br /><br />1) Natalie Portman = lovely and believable performance, especially toward the beginning of the film. I think she will be one of those stars that just goes on forever, impressing if not a little shy of stunning us with her beautiful acting skills.<br /><br />2) The cinematoghrapy, costumes and setting = The usage of color in this movie is very nice. We have a dark feel overall, spottedwith some reds and whites and just when it gets too dreary(for example, in Evey's cell), we get splashes of yellow and green(Valerie's story). All the outfits and colors fit the characters, although the Hitler-type motif was a little over the top. The city was appealingly clean and tidy yet chilling and lonely. The first blowing up of the building was unexpected eye-candy and Natalie's wardrobe stayed subtle, like her character.<br /><br />I don't mind so much if someone likes this movie(my boyfriend and my sister seem to enjoy it just fine) as long as you don't insult my intelligence by telling me its original, thought-provoking or daring.<br /><br />So, my View is that I am the Victim of this Valient effort, which Veered into Vanity and Verbosness, concluding with Virtually no Value.<br /><br />In short, V adored itself enough that none of us need to waste the effort.t when it gets too dreary(for example, in Evey's cell), we get splashes of yellow and green(Valerie's story).

B00009V8Z9|5.0|I am 100% in love with this cd. Gavin has a timeless sound and a definite talent above his peers. I find it very impressive when a young artist writes his own lyrics and music(he also plays all his own piano and keyboard) - it makes the performance personal and shows a vulnerable confidence in showing the world his mind.<br /><br />Gavin's musical talent is certainly heavily influenced by the Chart Toppers of a few decades past, but this serves him well, propelling him into his own genre with the foundation of talent from the classic singers.<br /><br />You hear The Beatles laid back yet catchy feel in \\"Chemical Party\\" - you can even hear a little of McCartney's vocal influence in Gavin's tone.<br /><br />\\"Just Friends\\" and \\"Belief\\" seem reminiscant of Billy Joel's style - you find yourself singing them over and over and liking them better each time.<br /><br />But the most obvious influence to me - from his squeaky falcetto to his peppy usage of instruments to his twirling vocals - is Stevie Wonder, who Gavin channels so precisely in nearly every song, most noticably in Follow Through and More Than Anyone. It's a wilful tribute that works for Gavin - I'd so love to hear a harmonica in there someday or perhaps even a duet with Wonder.<br /><br />The title track seems to bear the most originality and Gavinesce style - he's got a clever mind for wording and a tasteful ear for musical progression that is unique but easy on the ears.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to more projects from this promising artist!  Gavin's \\"Chariot\\" is certainly not \\"Overrated\\". : )
B000EWBNMS|5.0|Others have done a good job of reviewing the show concept --- so I'll just recap briefly. Based in part on the life experiences of a woman named Allison Dubois, this series features Patricia Arquette in an Emmy award-winning portrayal as a psychic-medium. As she comes to grips with her talents in this area, she helps the Phoenix district attorney with a variety of cases, but also wrestles complicated moral issues and deals with her at-home situation. She has three daughters and a husband who's an engineer, but is learning to accept the new complications that her work brings.<br /><br />Being a fan of series such as \\"Now and Again\\" (which was created and written in large part by the same people involved with this) and \\"Tru Calilng,\\" I immediately tuned into and clicked with this series. While I too possess a logical mind, oriented somewhat towards engineering and computer-programming, my mind is open to these ideas, and in any case, I enjoy a well-written and acted series.<br /><br />If you're interested in this DVD, there's a good chance you've already seen the first season or at least some of it and know all about the program. So you may be wondering about the special features on this DVD set. I can definitely say they're awesome and here's a rundown of what you'll find:<br /><br />- Extended version of Pilot --- Include several minutes of additional material seamlessly reintegrated into the show pilot. Most noteable here is a meal-time conversation between Allison and Captain Push that wasn't seen in the original.<br /><br />- Deleted scenes for several episodes --- As with most good television programs, these scenes weren't deleted necessaarily because there was anything wrong with them. They just needed to cut them for time and they weren't absolutely essential to the plot. Most of these are fairly short --- about thirty seconds to a minute.<br /><br />- Optional commentary --- cast and crew commentaries for several of the season's noteable episodes. Unlike some DVD commentaries, these generally make for interesting listening.<br /><br />- The Making of \\"Medium\\" --- Goes over casting, creation, and other noteables.<br /><br />- The Story of \\"Medium\\" --- Digs into the show story elements, also touches on some of that discussed in the \\"making-of.\\"<br /><br />- Interpreting Allison Dubois --- Discusses the issues of the characters life --- family and moral.<br /><br />- The Real Allison Dubois --- A profile of the the real person on which the character is based. If you've read her book, then some of this a refresher, but there's some interesting anecdotes in here as well that will probably be new to you.<br /><br />- Gag Reel --- A pretty standard gag reel featuring flubbed lines, etc. Generally amusing and light-hearted. Around ten minutes long.<br /><br />- TV Spots --- The original TV promotional spots seen on NBC to promote the premire/series. A nice inclusion.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great set for fans of the program. And if you've never seen it before, this is your chance to get caught up.le episodes.

B0000029GA|5.0|Illmatic is the definition of true east coast hip-hop.  No fan of rap or hip hop in general should be without their own, unripped copy of Illmatic.  Esco paints a picture of true inner city living through the eyes of a twenty year old adolescent turning into his own man.  Its one thing to listen to illmatic, and another thing to Understand and appreciate illmatic.  Literally take the lyrics, and interpret them through what you think Nas was seeing.  The most well rounded album ever, and yes, the best rap album of all time, no comparison. You can have your favorite Tupac albums, or your favorite biggie albums(Ready to Die).  You can have Jay-Z, Pac, Big, Pun. . . anybody be your favorite rapper.  But after taking a serious listen to Illmatic, one should realize that nothing that they put out can touch Illmatic.  Check the tracks <br />1. Genisis (basically just a filler) <br />2. NY State of Mind-Complete visualization of Queensbridge through Nas's Eyes.  Might be one of the best songs ever.

B000H305U0|2.0|Sleaze as an image is an interesting concept, especially for a teen market. I don't know what mysterious forces decide what will be big or not. Hmmm, the elusive x factor that makes people go yeah it's cool; Or whatever signifier that meet's the same sentiment.  But hey, little Justin -he's cute yeah?  'n' shakes his skinny white hips like he means it. Yeah his king of teen sleaze.  The trax remind me of mid to late 80's rap, I didn't have the patients for it then, I lost touch with it, till the mid 90's, when the hip-hop circus came into town.  I wonder what music historians would say about this period of music? What was the driving force behind the the music industry, Gangsters with trashy taste in music?  Hell I don't care, I just wish they knew more about melody not just grooves 'n' beats. My partner went off on a tirade lamenting 'bout back in the day. He started raving like a madman, how all the real singers of r&b have been muscled out `where are the Stevie Wonders of today the Johnny Manthis_es?  -K he kinda lost me at that point. Defensively I said i liked it, singing a long in my head `It's getting hot in here so take of all your cloths,' I realised this aint Nelly it's Justin's Dame Girl.  It's the same with the first track on FutureSex/LoveSounds, your just itch_in to sing `oomp oomp oopm another one bites the dust,' I'm sure I wanted to break into `I like the way she moves' at another point somewhere else.  I reckon the dude must have rescued a Cameo cd from a sale bin when he was a kid `n' stashed it away with his early bobby brown CD's. Hey I know it's like he tossed the Isley Brothers, Bobby Brown, Cameo in the blender and added a dash of Wacko Jacko & Evelyn Champ'ers King; A little too recondite I am. SexyBack is maybe the only track with staying power the rest is pulp. 20 years after the date, I'm sure an aging generation of retired teenagers will throw their hands in the air and shake their widening burdens to \\"Them mother Ph'Ers dont know how toact,\\" when the track is revived in some dirty dive you have to cue hours for. We did the same to `Don't stop till you get enough' aahhh 'The Wall ' now that CD was bursting with monster tracks; I was a horny 15 yr old nerd at the time -Can a nerd be horny?  Oh go ahead buy the dam CD, he looks like he'd be a lot of fun at a Bar_Mitzvah. I don't know why I said that I'm not even Jewish.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I'm very happy to say that Johnny boy did it once again. Great CD. John has come a long way from his first album \\"Room for Squares\\", which in my books was also great, but less innovative and mature. \\"Continuum\\" proves that Mayer is looking forward towards more than just teeniebopper rock-pop. This album brings to life Mayer's talented (and much needed) side of blues, funk, jazz, and rock. His sound is progressing naturally towards perfection, and I must say that its refreshing to hear music that soothes and relaxes the soul.  <br /> <br />My only problem with \\"Continuum\\" is his radio song \\"Waiting on the World to Change\\". This song may fool people into looking past this album as a keeper. The theme of the song is touching and maybe a bit thought-provoking, but it isnt directed towards the true sound of the album. My recommendation is to skip past this song. Mayer puts much more vocal and musical passion into the rest of the album than he does through \\"Waiting on the World to Change\\".  <br /> <br />Go out and buy \\"Continuum\\". The album establishes that John Mayer has created a sound that should very well carry on and progress for years to come. He is one of the few true musicians that I can honestly say I am happy to be a listener of; and in this time of musical nit-wits, we need more rockers like him out there.
0395645662|5.0|I first read this book many, many years ago when I was in grade school. I'm sure it was compulsory back then, but I've read it dozens of times since then on my own, and our family's copy of it is well-worn and missing the cover. <br /> <br />I am completely aghast at all of the reviews that stem from both parents and students questioning the values the book teaches. Many, many people are missing the point that while the community in which this takes place is painted as a utopia, it is decidedly not, which is what Jonas comes to realize by the end of the novel. Yes, in the book, the elderly are not valued, nor are birth mothers, lower-weight twins, the sick and mentally handicapped; however, as the book progresses, one realizes along with Jonas the absurdity of the values this \\"utopia\\" holds and comes to appreciate diversity in all forms. This book challenges the reader to examine their beliefs and embrace life. <br /> <br />Yes, this book does touch on more adult topics like euthanasia, puberty and sexual urges, war, etc., but these are not topics that are foreign to everyone under the age of 14, and there is no reason a mature younger child should not be allowed to read and enjoy the book. Can it be scary to someone not ready for it? Yes, perhaps, but I would challenge the parents of the scared child to discuss the issues presented in the book with their child and help them realize that this is a \\"what if\\" story and does not, thankfully, represent reality - yet.  <br /> <br />I can appreciate how some might find this story boring and some younger readers may not understand what is happening, and therefore not appreciate it. However, I read it for the first time at a very young age and was never bored nor frightened by it, and I appreciate the story and timeliness of the events even now.
B000HA4W4S|5.0|The Scissor Sisters are a great group to listen to while getting ready to go out to a club.  This album has many high-energy songs that are fun to sing along with while you're dancing around getting ready.  I really enjoy tracks 1, 2, 3, 8, 9 & 10.  \\"Making Ladies\\" off the bonus disc is worth the entire price of this set.  This album isn't as eclectic as their first, but it is still a lot of fun.  If you're looking for the most innovative music, this isn't the cd for you...but if you're looking for a fun, dancy CD, get this today.
B00000I5Y6|2.0|I absolutely loved that song \\"Carry On Wayward Son\\" which sounds like one of the greatest stuff in history. Rest of the other songs on this album are not that good. 2-stars.
B0000074FL|5.0|Another classy under rated effort.<br /><br />After all these years you go back and realize how good it was and how good we really had it.<br /><br />Some lost & overlooked gems on this release.<br /><br />Scott Gorham and Snowy White have some awesome moments together.<br /><br />Bottom line. The first 5 songs are GREAT. Some real powerful material here. I have listened to those time and time again and love them for all the right reasons.<br /><br />The first 5 songs in my opinion propel this album to that 5 star rating.<br /><br />\\"Angel of Death\\" is a pummeling assault on the senses.<br /><br />\\"Renegade\\" has that Dire Straits influence all over it. Shows us what Dire Straits would sound like with some heavy twin leads/harmony.<br /><br />\\"The Pressure will blow\\" is icing on the cake, and \\"Leave this town\\" has that powerhouse ZZ Top vibe going for it.<br /><br />So far we've got some true gems. They deserve excessive repeated listening. Another gem is \\"Hollywood\\"- the twin harmony solo...gets me every time! Love it.<br /><br />The rest of the album from \\"No one told him\\", \\"Fat's\\" to \\"It's getting dangerous\\" can be referred to as decent material but nothing that truly shines like the first half of this release.<br /><br />They do not rock in the typical Lizzy sense of the word.<br /><br />I'm thinking they would be better on a Phil Lynott solo release than a Lizzy album.<br /><br />Those that slammed this release or have given it low ratings must have gotten lost somewhere along the way.<br /><br />Highly recommend this album. You will not be disappointed.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|Dire Straits are my favorite band. They are just as good or better than Foreigner. Love Over Gold is one of their best albums that has a few of the greatest rock songs like \\"Telegraph Road\\", and \\"It Never Rains\\". Get all their albums til you see Alchemy. Get this with Foreigner Four today.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|When the first three Star Wars movies were first issued on DVD,people complained that the originals should be made available.Well now they are and guess what? People are still complaining! You didn't like them when Lucas tampered with them and you don't like them when he didn't.Huh? They're just movies people! If you don't like the restored versions,don't buy them. If you find some kind of fault with the originals,life will go on. It's just money to Fox Studios and Lucas. Otherwise,THEY DON'T CARE.<br /><br />  Besides all of that,as money oriented as the average corporation is,almost everyone that bought those Lucas \\"restored\\" Star Wars boxsets should have known that the originals would be issued shortly. You had to see this one coming people...
B00004Y6NV|5.0|This is the best Dire Straits release and is probably one of the greatest albums of all time. I can't get enough of the greatest rockin roll song ever in \\"Heavy Fuel\\". I play it over and over and over and never get tired of it!!! It's just the greatest song in rock and roll history. This album has to be in every music fan's collection. <br />It is simply the BEST.........Buy it now!!! 1,000,000,000 stars. <br />DIRE STRAITS ROCK,DIRE STRAITS ROCK,DIRE STRAITS ROCK,DIRE STRAITS ROCK,DIRE STRAITS ROCK,DIRE STRAITS ROCK,DIRE STRAITS ROCK,DIRE STRAITS ROCK,DIRE STRAITS ROCK,DIRE STRAITS ROCK,DIRE STRAITS ROCK,DIRE STRAITS ROCK,DIRE STRAITS ROCK,DIRE STRAITS ROCK,DIRE STRAITS ROCK,DIRE STRAITS ROCK... <br />
B000002UB3|5.0|All I can tell you is that this is the way a swansong SHOULD sound.Even though they had major issues amongst each other at this time,they along with producer George Martin put out one hell of an album.This time around George Harrison came up with two of his best in \\"Something\\" and (my favorite song on the album) \\"Here Comes The Sun\\".Although John's heart wasn't truly in it,he still contributed \\"Come Together\\" and \\"She's So Heavy\\".Both songs are John Lennon classics .Paul's major additives were the infamous second side/second half medley,and a McCartney classic in \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" and it's reprise during the medley.It's mind boggling how a group can evolve from \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\" to \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" in six years.<br /><br />Buffy's take on Abbey Road<br /><br />(On a scale of one to ten)<br /><br />Come Together  9<br /><br />Something  10<br /><br />Maxwell's Silver Hammer  8<br /><br />Oh Darling  8<br /><br />Octopus's Garden  8.5<br /><br />She's So Heavy 11<br /><br />Here Comes The Sun  11.5<br /><br />Becacuse  10<br /><br />You Never Give Me Your Money 10<br /><br />Sun King  8<br /><br />Mean Mister Mustard  9.5<br /><br />Polythene Pam  8<br /><br />She Came In Through The Bathroom Window  9.5<br /><br />Golden Slumbers 10<br /><br />Carry That Weight  10<br /><br />The End 10<br /><br />Her Majesty 9.5<br /><br />OVERALL SCORE: 9.4 HIGHLY RECOMMEDED!<br /><br />P.S. The accapella version of \\"Because\\" is stellar! It's only available on the costly compilation ANTHOLOGY 3.<br /><br />P.S.S:  Kids of today take note:The Beatles broke up 36 years ago,and their old recordings still move units.Considering that most of this generation's music is stolen,I mean \\"sampled\\" from an old song,will these acts REALLY be as popular as the Beatles are 36 years from now?
B00008BXJG|1.0|AC/DC are just as bad as Nirvana. Bon Scott sings so horribly, and just sounds like a dying duck who just screams. The fact is, AC/DC they've only made a single decent song in the title track \\"Highway To Hell\\". The rest of the other albums and songs are terrible. I'm glad both Kurt Cobain and Bon Scott are DEAD!!! Thankfully they will never annoy me again. For good lovely music, get Foreigner and Dire Straits insted <br />who were a billion times better than this lousy AC/DC album. <br />Avoid this and Nevermind of Nirvana 2 of the worst albums <br />ever. <br />
B00005R24G|5.0|Michael Caine and Lawrence Olivier give a stella performance in this delicious murder mystery.  I have seen this film several times, and although knowing the twist, it is the great performances of Caine and Olivier that makes this movie worth watching.  The script is as good as a script can get, with Olivier lapping up every delicious line with gusto, and a young Caine having no problem standing on his own brilliant performance next to the master. <br /> <br />This is no 'ceuf pourri' by any means.  And although not a new movie, one must return to 'the place they are familiar with' and ..... relish the enjoyment of this film. <br /> <br />Although 'Milo' (Caine's character) is in a 'sticky' situation, the back and fourth of betrayl from beginning to end is worth keeping within a 'photo album' of deciet.  Seek the truth, and while doing so, lap up this brilliant film.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|Wow!!! This is another song I can play over and over and over without getting tired of besides the all-time great \\"Heavy Fuel\\", \\"Money For Nothing\\". It's just best, and absolutely one of the greatest songs of all time. That song is just pure a million stars. <br /> <br />Anyway, the whole record is pretty good. It's not their best though. <br />The reason I rate this a five is because Money For Nothing is hugely <br />recommended....Listen to it.
6301969294|1.0|Unbelievable plot, wooden charactors mouthing Ayn Rands extreme individualist philosophies in set speeches that grate the ear. Also the most unbeievable \\"Not Guilty\\" verdict in the history of movie trials.
B000HEWEE4|4.0|I've seen the movie twice and I loved it!  It's one of those movies that makes you want to sit back with glass of wine and relax (like Chocolat).  <br /> <br />Don't put too much thought into it - its fiction.  Just enjoy the show!
0060776757|5.0|I had just purchased my copy while in the Killiney/Dublin area this past weekend.I read it cover to cover on the flight back home to Philadelphia.Purchase this book ...you will not be disappointed.The pictures alone are worth it. The in depth conversations with each band member is extraordinary!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I agree with the other commenters.  This movie is must-see.  Global warming is the greatest single threat to our planet.  I fear for my daughter -- the world she will inherit from us. <br /> <br />When the movie came out, I sent emails to everyone I know asking them to join my family and me at the showing.  No one came.  These aren't bad people.  I think they're just people with so many things going on in their lives, they want to ignore it so maybe \\"it'll go away\\" -- they don't want to be convinced that it's really happening -- it's much easier to believe the oil industry's pseudo-scientific claims. <br /> <br />There are so many friends and family members to whom I want to give a copy.  I think it would help spread the word -- it can't hurt.  It would be much appreciated if there was a quantity discount given for purchases of more than one copy -- would definitely allow me to \\"spread the word\\" farther.  (?further?)   <br /> <br />Amazon - can you talk to Paramount on our behalf regarding quantity discounts?  Thanks.
0307346609|5.0|This book truly does an amazing job going down the what-if zombies took over the world scenario. It doesn't read like your typical work of fiction, but is arranged as a series of interviews with some of the protaganists or antagonists who have survived (or even prospered) when a deadly epidemic sweeps the world turning most of the population into the living dead who feed off the living. The main reason why this book works so well is that like most good horror novels it is so firmly grounded in reality that you truly believe that something so horrific could actually happen or is happening. In fact the reality here is  played-off so effectively against current events and references (direct or indirect) to present day political reality that you have to remind yourself somewhat regretfully that it is a work of fiction after all. Brooks' use of footnotes peppered liberally to explain some fictional militaristic jargon or colloqualism is highly effectual in creating the journalistic ambience of the novel. The description of zombie warfare and the explanations for why it is so hard to fight them even with all the modern strategy and technology at hand is evidence that Brooks has thought and played the scenarios out carefully and logically. And logic is really the key here, what-if scenarios often breakdown when the logic is exhausted but here it is maintained with a straight face right through to the end. George Romero revealed a little of this hyper-reality juxtaposed against zombies in those news footages he interspersed in his \\"dead\\" series but I think Brooks has really taken that to a whole new level. There are a few \\"interviews\\" which feel a little contrived, especially the Japanese experiences which seem right out of some bad samurai flick. But the scope of the book is quite international and not so ethnocentric which makes it all the more impressive. The only question I would have for him is: What happened in North Korea?
B0000AQS0F|4.0|It seems simple enough yet year after year we are given show after show of drivel. What makes Firefly worth watching? Excellent writing & dialogue, compelling characters, big budget production values, and great acting. Sounds pretty simple yet so many fail.  <br /> <br />A science fiction western sounds corny enough and I don't think I was the only one that assumed this was a joke. However, considering that human expansion into space would most likely invoke a `frontier/pioneer' approach with little law and order, bad guys, and a struggle for survival actually meld well with a science fiction backdrop.  <br /> <br />What this provides is a quirky contrast of high tech futurism with dusty good ole western revisionism combined with humanistic themes from episode to episode. It's a constant battle to earn a living and survive with your morals and values intact a scenario that the crew members sometimes painfully encounter.  <br /> <br />A ragtag crew led by straight as an arrow and war vet Capt. Malcolm Reynolds (played extremely well by Nathan Fillion) and his 2nd in command Zoe with her pilot husband Wash, plus spunky engineer Kaylee, tough guy/politically incorrect Jayne, and Inara a registered, very professional prostitute. They pick up three passengers that give them more than their share of trouble, the priest-like shepherd, the doctor, and his mysterious, deranged sister River. Together, they seek out jobs (often heists and illegal transport) all the while evading the evil alliance that will stop at nothing to get River who has been subjected to mind altering experiments and may be a catalyst for human evolution.  <br /> <br />My favorite episodes were Objects in Space (great story about a bounty hunter) and Serenity Pts I & II. Honorable mention goes to the Message (an old friend turns up with a special package) and Heart of Gold (the crew go to help a whorehouse defend itself against a real baddie). All are great, these are just my personal faves.  <br /> <br/>So why was it cancelled after just one season when there seems to be a huge following? Perhaps viewers were sci-fied out or fed up with Star Trek and it's many recent offshoots, the SciFi channel with dross like Battlestar Galactica (Why? It was crap then, it's crap now), Babylon Five, etc, etc. Firefly aired, some watched it, most didn't for the reasons mentioned, and then when word spread about how good it was, the damage had been done. Low ratings, little perceived appeal, and a fairly big budget for a TV show. Sometimes timing is everything and the huge following was unfortunately too little too late. There were some weaknesses like lack of creative planetary environments (no real freaky settings) and lack of aliens but this is nitpicking.  <br /> <br />Of course, Fox were trigger-happy and jumped the gun without realizing that they had a show that could have lasted for several years with great ratings and made oodles of money but at the time, the ratings just weren't there. We can blame ourselves (those who didn't watch at first) and Fox for the demise of a show that held so much potential. We have Serenity the movie (great as well!) but still......boohoo.  <br />
B000GRUS22|3.0|I have been waiting for months for the release of Enigma 6. Today is a disappointing day. When I heard that the album's title translation meant \\"Retrospective or analyze past experiences\\", I was prepared for this album to rekindle the magic of the early albums and blow me away. sadly, I wasn't blown away and I found myself moving forward through tracks without finishing the previous to see if any of the songs grabbed me. I love the female vocals in the previous albums, and they are sorely missed here. Most of the tracks are repetitive and sound alike. Once the song starts, that is pretty much what you get. With the exception of \\"Goodbye Milkyway\\" there are no standout tracks here. I am going to give it a few more listens and see if I don't warm up to it as I did with \\"Voyageur\\", but without any of the magic in previous songs like \\"Return To Innocence, I Love You I'll Kill You, Gravity Of Love\\" I am afraid this album may indeed take 6th place.
B00006IM9Q|5.0|Blondie is one of the greatest and most important bands in the history of pop/rock to have ever existed.  While Grace Slick might have predated one-time Playboy bunny/vocalist Deborah Harry, Ms. Harry still set all of the standards as far as any future women in rock.  She showed that it was possible for an extremely attractive female to front an all male backing band and do it with style, sex appeal and genuine raw talent while not coming across as a tramp.<br /><br />The band itself were cracker jack musicians as well.<br /><br />While Blondie is more well known for it's singles than albums, listening to this gloriously remastered greatest hits compilation covering their years from 1979 to 1982 (with one track from their 1999 comeback album No Exit as well), it's easy to see why people could be easily satisfied with just picking up this greatest hits CD instead of their individual albums.<br /><br />Every song on here is a classic.  Every song represents the pinnacle of production technique, performance, songwriting ability with the added appeal of the immensely talented (and wonderously sexy) vocals of Ms. Harry.<br /><br />Want to hear some amazingly creative guitar work?  Listen to this CD.  Want to hear some super grooving bass lines?  It's here too.  Want to hear impeccably smart pop-rock songwriting on every track?  Yep, you can't go wrong in any way with this CD.<br /><br />My  only small complaint is that since this CD came out a year or 2 before their 2003 release Curse of Blondie, it's missing the 2 singles from that album. Maybe they could re-issue it at some point as there is room for the 2 singles to fit on here from that album.<br /><br />For people wanting the perfect taste test of this wonderful band, this CD is perfect.  People wanting to dig deeper and check out the individual albums will then find some equally great tracks that never got released as singles.<br /><br />Blondie will never be matched IMO.
0743270754|5.0|I \\"read\\" this book as a book on tape.  This is a superlative book about Lincoln and his contemporaries.  As I stated in my title:  \\"It has a 'you are there' quality about it\\" which makes it fascinating.  It's like \\"a time machine\\" in that respect.<br /><br />The Civil War has been written about from many perspectives. Every participant in The War has his or her own viewpoint.  And, each battle has been written about as a \\"separate\\" entity.  I myself have visited several battle fields---I visited a re-enactment at Antietam several years ago--I recommend viewing these \\"re-enactments\\" when you have a chance.  I hope to visit a re-enactment at Gettysburg in 2007.  This excellent and \\"inspired\\" work of the historians \\"art\\" takes the vantage point of what it would have been like to be in Washington, DC and to be part of President Lincoln's cabinet.  Doris Goodwin writes a splendid \\"overview\\" of The Civil War from that perspective.  If you love history, this is a \\"must read\\".  Recommended.  Email: boland7214@aol.<br /><br />PS: I just read (or heard on the book on tape) that before Fort Sumter fell there were only 9,000 troops in Washington, DC to \\"guard\\" The President and the city.  Wasn't Lincoln a bit \\"rash\\" and didn't it show \\"poor planning\\" to defy the South when the capitol city of The Union had so few soldiers available as guardians?
B000GRUS22|4.0|To Mr. Cretu, in case you browse these reviews:   <br /> <br />I love the \\"wailing\\" -- and all of the ethnic or otherwordly flavored vocals, chants, whisperings -- much more so than the rather pedestrian sound of the sung, melodic English. <br /> <br />And often, the sounds I end up enjoying the most are ones that may not have grabbed me until after several listens.  Sometimes it takes awhile for what the artist is really doing to be revealed. <br /> <br />Thanks for another fine piece of art.
B000002672|5.0|Accept was a German metal band that sounded like a cross between Judas Priest and AC/DC with a troll as lead singer who sounded like an over-the-top mesh of Bon Scott and Brian Johnson.<br /><br />Accept released ten studio albums during their career; most cite \\"Restless & Wild\\" (1983) and \\"Balls to the Wall\\" (1984) as their best recordings. This is true but I feel 1986's \\"Russian Roulette\\" stands on a par with these two earlier releases.<br /><br />Here's a run down of the songs on \\"Russian Roulette:\\"<br /><br />1.) T.V. WAR (3/5 Stars): This is an energetic and fun metal rocker reminiscent of \\"Fast as a Shark\\" but not quite as good.<br /><br />2.) MONSTERMAN (5/5 Stars): \\"Monsterman\\" is brief at a mere 3:24, but it's catchy as heck. The bridge is melodically potent and the chorus is uniquely inspired. You'll never hear anything else like it. Who knows what the lyrics are about, who cares?<br /><br />3.) RUSSIAN ROULETTE (4/5 Stars): This titular song eerily starts off with a militaristic drone and riff before kicking into a mid-paced slice of 80's non-hair-band metal. In light of the chorus lyrics, one wonders why they didn't call the song \\"Wargames.\\"<br /><br />4.) IT'S HARD TO FIND A WAY (4.5/5 Stars): This is a catchy pop rocker with an incredibly hook-laden chorus. It should have been a hit on the radio. Some cried \\"Sell out!\\" but, come on, it's just ONE song.<br /><br />5.) AIMING HIGH (3/5 Stars): This isn't a bad piece of filler between the better songs.<br /><br />6.) HEAVEN IS HELL (5/5 Stars): This is the second masterpiece of the album. It's structure is very reminiscent of \\"Balls to the Wall,\\" although it doesn't sound like that song. The lyrics are an intriguing commentary on religion and religious people with the conclusion that we experience (or make our own) heaven or hell during our life on this earth. I strongly agree with some of their points and disagree with others but, regardless, the lyrics are not presented in an offensive way. Here's one stanza that I agree with:<br /><br />I'm sure we all know them<br /><br />Those perverts, they're everywhere<br /><br />Mmh, we're talking straight about facts<br /><br />You know deep inside what's right or wrong<br /><br />And the world stinks, and the paradise is now a sewer<br /><br />And they sell sh*t for gold<br /><br />And you have to take what you've got<br /><br />As you can see the words are honest, overt, slightly ambiguous and completely brilliant all at the same time.<br /><br />7.) ANOTHER SECOND TO BE (3/5 Stars): Another brief enjoyable ditty.<br /><br />8.) WALKING IN THE SHADOW (4/5 Stars): Emotionally potent and intriguing tune that deals with a person struggling to live on in face of the 58,000 that died during the Vietnam conflict. Whether the guilt is over one combat victim or all 58,000 is a mite unclear.<br /><br />9.) MAN ENOUGH TO CRY (4.5/5 Stars): Great short piece! The title somewhat reveals the mature subject matter, but the lyrics maintain an esoteric element.<br /><br />10.) STAND TIGHT (5/5 Stars): This is a creative and aggressive number with a melodic bridge and ultra-catchy chorus with cool backgound vocals. It has militaristic vibe and is the third masterpiece of the album.<br /><br />Some have criticized that Accept were trying to go pop rock on this album but nothing could be further from the truth. \\"Russian Roulette\\" features the same diverse song-writing of both \\"Restless & Wild\\" and \\"Balls to the Wall.\\" Yeah, one or two songs would've fit well on the radio, so what?<br /><br />One thing this CD proves is that Accept had perhaps the best background vocals in all of metal at the time and even to this day (!).<br /><br />\\"Russian Roulette\\" is quite a bit better than the good-but-not-great \\"Metal Heart,\\" which was released in 1985. The song-writing on \\"Metal Heart\\" just wasn't as good, plus Udo (the singer) went overkill with his irritating screaming, which no doubt turned off potential life-long fans. Hence, when \\"Russian Roulette\\" was released the next year not many took notice. They should have.<br /><br />My five favorite Accept albums are as follows:<br /><br />\\"Restless & Wild,\\" \\"Balls to the Wall\\" and \\"Russian Roulette\\"<br /><br />\\"Predator\\" (1996) -- their last studio album, inexplicably underrated.<br /><br />\\"Metal Heart\\"<br /><br />Check 'em all out.tte\\" was released the next year not many took notice.

0743201140|5.0|A fantastic book of weekness and strength, a human being is a mixture of weekness and strength equally and those among us who take work with thier strength come out successful regardless of the profession they are involve in, they can focus on thier strength rather than weakness, positive attitude regardless all the adversaries of a life. I learned a great deal out of this Marcus Buckingham book and I strongly recommend to the book lovers don't miss this one.
B00000I8DY|4.0|This is one of my favorite Cosi's. The cast is uniformly strong, and the Concerto Koln sizzle with a wild abandon that really brings the score to life. Above all, there is some really superb ensemble singing which pretty much trumps every other recording. Singers trained in 16th and 17th century music are usually much better listeners than those that start romantic then try to go back to Mozart. This allows for all sort of interplay levels between orchestra and voices that are absent from more poorly listened performances. If opera is all about solo singing to you, then you may not find anything special here, but if you thrill to hear every single element brought to light, than there is much to recommend it. <br /> <br />As another reviewer said, Gens can sometimes go off pitch, and I find her attempts at ornamentation (accompanied by huge ritardando's from Jacobs) very predictable and distracting. Even so, I think its a lovely Fiordiligi. She really makes a great partner with Fink's equally superb Dorabella, and her ringing soprano just combines luciously with her huskier low tones. <br /> <br />Oddone is a fine Zerlina. She has a uniquely comical voice, that is none the less pleasing to the ear. She does tend to repeat a certain mannerism however, where she draws out a long tone then \\"clips\\" it at the end of a phrase. To be fair I think its conducted by Jacobs, as he seems to find these occasional orchestra \\"winks\\" witty. Minor quibbles though in a fine performance. <br /> <br />The men also are superb ensembelists, though I find their individual voices less moving than the women. Ferrando sings beautifully, but a bit bloodlessly for my taste. I think this part should have more fire, like Araiza for Marriner (one of his best performaces ever). Alfonso and Guiglemo are also excellent, if rather undistinctive. <br /> <br />Jacobs does tend towards extreme tempos at times, but it tends to come off so well and surprising that you can't help but be impressed. The concerto Koln tends towards a more wiry string sound, which some folks do not like, but they are so lively and expressive that you hardly notice. <br /> <br />Along with Rattle, this is my favorite recorded Cosi. I'd also recommend Marriner and Bohm's more traditional performances, though they both have some caveats. <br /> <br />All that being said, I have decided to knock a star off for the self-conscious and repetative mannerisms that Jacobs likes to use.  I find these get more and more tiresome on repetition and a purchased recording should be one that gets better with age, not worse.
B000005RFH|5.0|Band Personnell: <br />Ozzy Osbourne - Vocals <br />Tony Iommi - Guitars and Keyboards <br />Geezer Butler - Bass <br />Bill Ward - Drums <br /> <br />The very first Sabbath album, the name came from a song that Butler wrote when the band was called \\"Earth\\", because of this they managed to call the band \\"Black Sabbath\\" too and the first album was titled after the artist name, it includes two cover songs such as \\"Evil Woman\\" and \\"The Warning\\". <br />It's a great album, especially to be their first one.
0812550706|5.0|I am by no means a sci-fi fan, but this book is enough to convert me. It sat on my book shelf for ages, finally I picked it up, and couldn't put it down. Ender is an advanced child groomed to be a leader, taken through a battery of  physical and mental anguish, that we can all in someway relate to. From start to finish this book flys by.
B000005RS6|5.0|Band Personnell: <br />Ian Gillan - Vocals <br />Steve Morse - Guitars <br />Roger Glover - Bass <br />Ian Paice - Drums <br />Jon Lord - Organs and Keyboards <br /> <br />This album is G-R-E-A-T, Steve shows how great he tackles the classic riffs by Blackmore, Gillan is somethimes lacking but he's got strenght and hit the notes great, this live album is the best since \\"Made in Japan\\", buy it, highly recommended.
B000HA4W4S|5.0|Too many people are influenced by popular culture: it is a sad, sad fact.  That which companies pay to have played is what some come to expect.  The album is all killer, no filler.  Many know the opening song, so let's discuss what happens after that: <br />\\"She's my man\\": this tune is an ode to New Orleans; or rather, a dark, twisted tale of a female homicidal prostitute who spent much time floating down the Mississippi.  This might be a good time to discuss Jake Shear's lyrics: creative, original, and compelling.  All the way through.  Even what seems like a simple love song (e.g., \\"The other side\\") delves deeper into philosophy about life and death.  Musically, this song reminds people of \\"I'm still standing\\" - that is because they only listen to the piano; musically, like in the rest of the album, you hear a group of musicians that have elevated to the professional level.  So many layers and having David Bowie's old bassist only adds to this.  Sure, the music does reflect the musical influences that have shaped this band, but by no means is it regurgitation. <br />\\"I can't decide\\":  Dark lyricism at its best.  I love this song.  It is short, sweet and endearingly bitter.  More banjos!   <br />\\"Lights\\": My goodness I love this song!  Start off's off: \\"No pussyfootin' or that look of surprise\\".  OK, add the brass backing, the disco funk rhythms and you have what I think is the best track on the CD (or 2nd best..) <br />\\"Land of a Thousand Words\\" - a beautiful love song that does not make your teeth rot like most crud out there.   <br />\\"Intermission\\" - sounds like movie intermission music, lol.  It is a fun little ditty that clear the palette for the 2nd half. <br />\\"Kiss you off\\": Ana gets lead vocals.  It is a \\"pack your bags and move out\\" song (all while shaking your booty). <br />\\"Ooh\\": I was lucky to get a demo of this a couple years ago.  THIS is the song I love most!  OK, it is the \\"pop\\" song - but it is the most funky, dancey inspirational song ever.  I love it so much, words fail me.  \\"Got magic in my danin' shoes\\" -  <br />\\"Paul McCartney\\": Jake actually dreamed this one.  Love it.  This is the song to def. put on your iPod when going to the gym! <br />\\"The other side\\": awesome, beautiful, romantic, tragic. <br />\\"Might tell you tonight\\": I think this is the only song you can be allowed to not like.  It is good, but it is shows that excited feeling you get when falling in love, so it can make you feel sad too if you are not experiencing this in your own life at this time.  <br />\\"Everybody wants the same thing\\" - the anthem of the CD.  Title says it all. <br />The bonus tracks are all equally awesome: \\"Making ladies\\" is really just too much fun and is as close as many will get to hearing the early stages of the band's sound before the 1st album came out (i.e. what the unreleased demo album sounds like).  \\"Transistor\\" is an instant classic.  \\"Hair baby\\", \\"Contact high\\" and \\"Almost sorry\\" (the latter co-written by Paul \\"the Muppets\\" Williams!!) are all awesome as well.  Styles vary greatly on this bonus CD and you can see how good these guys are as songwriters.   <br />I cannot say enough how good this is.  The UK \\"gets it\\"; hopefully, Americans will get on board. <br /> <br />
079073804X|1.0|Okay so we've been through all this before, the Exorcist is one of the scariest films ever. That much and the fact that Friedkin's direction was impeccable adds to the charm of this timeless masterpiece.<br /><br />What I'm really here to talk about is the delays of this so called 25th anniversary edition. I don't know what's wrong with it, but it says, first, that it ships 2 to 4 weeks after buying and that it is shipped from and sold by Amazon... now how could it be that I've bought it on september 9th 2006 and now, it's september 27th and they sent me an email telling me I would have to wait until november 26th 2006 to get it???<br /><br />They have the stocks so it should be pretty easy. I bought many items from them for well over five years and this situation has never happened before. EVER.<br /><br />It was also mentionned in the email that I would have to confirm the dates by approving them... but when I decide not to do so, leaving a blank square, I'm returned to the page so I don't have any choice but to wait until the October 26th date is passed so that they can cancel it themselves.<br /><br />Amazon executives, I deeply trusted you until now. And this incident didn't happen at the best time, so if you even read this before the first hald of October, delete my order.<br /><br />I don't want to wait for another three months.

B000G8NY4U|4.0|If you want to watch a bunch of talented or should I say gifted musicians around the world then this DVD is an outstanding choice. From piano to saxophone to flute to harp to violin to hammered dulcimer, to name a few, the show offers a variety of music taste. However, there was one instrument that was missing in the concert, the guitar ...  (no electric, no accoustic, no classical) I don't know if Yanni forgot it or something but it would be the complete music event if it had been included. Right now, this DVD occupies the 2nd spot on my list trailing behind his Tribute DVD. If you would listen to the song Love is All from the Tribute concert, you will know why I am missing the wonderful Spanish guitar sound!    The singers are wonderful, Michelle Amato and Alfreda Gerald deliver top notch performance, I would like to see them as singers in Pink Floyld concert, Dark Side of the Moon, they are that good! All musicians are the cream of the crop in the world, especially the 2 guest violonists, how can they play that fast?  I am also glad to see Charlie Adams back as the drummer,a long time Yanni's friend, he rocks! The songs that really struck me were Storm and World Dance, although other songs were just outstanding too. The sound is offered in Digital 5.1 and DTS, nice. The video quality is good, not exceptional since I see some grainy picture in certain passage.    The bonus feature has good behind the scene information, it is short though.
B000DWMN2S|4.0|With DVDs and fast forward, I usually watch most movies with a remote control in hand.  Opening credits - fast forward.  Music montages - fast forward.  Mindless action - fast forward. It takes me awhile before I trust a movie enough to put the remote down.  I put the remote down during this film.  This film is clever.  Visually stunning.  Musically hilarious.  Uncomfortably funny.<br /><br />This movie is about a young man who collects things - any thing in relation to his family and his travels.  He keeps the things in clear ziploc bags so they are easy to sort and see.  He travels far away in search of a \\"city\\" connected to his family's past, a city that every local person either is unaware of or pretends to know nothing about.<br /><br />The young man is named Jonathan.  He is driven around in search of the old city by a translator his age, named Alex, and an old man driver.  Alex asks Jonathan why he collects, \\"Why do you do this?\\"  Jonathan replies, \\"I guess sometimes I'm afraid I'll forget.\\"  \\"In case anyone comes searching.\\"<br /><br />Jonathan collects things that most other people discard.  Like the boy Salvatore in the movie Cinema Paradiso, who collects all the \\"good parts\\" of movies that others find valueless or perverse, Jonathan treasures keeping hold of items from his past with emotional significance.<br /><br />They meet an old woman who knew Jonathan's ancestors.  She too is a collector of things from the lost parts of her past.  But she keeps things in opaque and labeled boxes, possibly because they would be too much and too painful to look at all the time.  We know Jonathan looks just like his grandfather from an old picture Jonathan has of his grandfather when he was his age.  The old woman must take off Jonathan's glasses to identify him.  She has to remove his perspective to see the accurate dimensions of his eyes.  The old woman takes him to the \\"city\\" that no longer exists and tells them of how it was destroyed.  She tells him how the Nazis forced every man in the village to spit on all their books of learning and sacred texts.  They forced the villagers at gun point to deny any points of authority in contradiction to their own.  If you weren't with them, then you were against them - the Nazi's rationale.  The Germans believed it was best to have only one true authority and non-Aryan ideas should be silenced forever.<br /><br />I recommend this movie for reasons beyond what I fully understand.  It is a journey of self-discovery.  And it is journey that may illuminate how we interpret others close to us.<br /><br />The old man driver escorting Jonathan around the old country has his own secrets.  He insists he is blind, but he can see.  He says he hates taking people around on their quests, but he has his own quests and demons driving him.  The translator says of him, \\"Something is not right.  It is as if he is dreaming all the time.\\"  He spends much of his time talking to himself.  I have a theory that most people who \\"talk to themselves\\" are not crazy.  They have just lost contact with someone important, someone with whom their conversation was cut off horribly prematurely.  And they forever try to continue that conversation any way they can.to spit on all their books of learning and sacred texts.

B000GFLAI0|5.0|<br />Given the fact that this album is great. The listening is easy and every track is enoyable - We give it 4 stars for the music and lyrics. <br />We must always give Dylan an additional star aimply because Dylan, who many of us grew up with, is simply the Mozart of our 63 past years. <br />As long as Dylan lives, Bruce will always be the Prince . <br />Aprrciate the gift we were given; being ale to grow up with Bob. Enjoy <br />the music, and the gift ! <br />Long LIve The King !
B000AL730O|4.0|It's like apples and oranges Lady Prudence.  <br /> <br />But before I get into that, let me say that Riding to Vanity Fair is actually about his DAUGHTER Heather, not Heather Mills. They never really got along and Heather said something in an interview (presumably with Vanity Fair?) that Paul didn't like. <br /> <br />Back to the comparison. Dylan is a folk/country/blues artist. Pure Americana. A poet, a lyricist. What Paul is trying to do is completely different. First of all, Paul has a very British mentality. He is about melody and concise song structure and overall mood. Dylan has never had anything to do with melody or concise song structure. He's about symbolism, lack of song structure (sometimes even rambling, especially on Modern Times), a specific mood. <br /> <br />And let me just say, the two of them are probably the best at what they do, i love them both. If you want a poem set to music, listen to Dylan. If you want melody and inventiveness, listen to Paul. <br /> <br />I find it strange that you think Dylan has matured and Paul hasn't.  Explain to me what huge advances Dylan has made in his music and/or lyrics. I enjoy his new stuff, but Love and Theft and Modern Times, generally speaking, do not feel different than Bringing it All Back Home or Blood on the Tracks. He still has the same songwriting philosophy, as does Paul. But the fact that Paul used Nigel Godrich shows his willingness to try something new. Chaos and Creation may not be your thing, but it's CERTAINLY NOT a rehash of Wings. Not even close, maybe even the opposite. Wings was huge arena rock. The majority of Chaos is somber and intimate. <br /> <br />Maybe go into it with a different mindset. I think it's a highly enjoyable record.
B000HEWEE4|2.0|Ridiculous, saccharine, marshmallow fluff. Being a resident of Chicago I watched this movie for the exteriors and the interior of my neighborhood bar, The Green Mill. The degree of implausibility makes this one pretty hard to swallow. This director should seriously have his dramatic license revoked. Bullock's forlorn mumbling and Reeves' stilted monologues make this \\"endearing\\"  film unendurable. The supporting plots of her mother and his dad do little to buttress this split screen gibberish. I never like to give completely negative reviews so I'll leave you with this. The costumes were very believable and the part of Jack the dog was ably played.
B000F3AAUW|4.0|I'm new to these artists but I bought the CD mostly because of \\"Crazy\\" and a general curiosity, piqued by other reviews here.  It definitely took some getting used to -- on my first listen it all sounded very random and chaotic, but I find the album is growing on me.  One thing I don't quite get, though, is why they opted for what sounds like recording levels set too high on some tracks, so that vocals sound like a radio station not tuned properly (or AM under a bridge!).  I don't know if this is a \\"thing\\" for these artists or the genre, but it still bugs me, kind of like the clumpy paint applications of Van Gogh. ;)  I can't say if this will become a favorite album, but it's certainly fun when I'm in the mood for something a little off-kilter.
B000H7JD4K|4.0|The September 24, 2006 review by D.Andrade calls this record a \\"weak album\\" but his review is inconsistent. <br /> <br />About guitarist Janick Gers, he states that \\"its time for Janick to step aside\\" and \\"his sloppy playing is just not cutting it\\" and he believes Janick is dragging the band down. <br /> <br />Just two paragraphs later, he writes that \\"there are a few good hooks in some of the songs, and The Legacy is a truly great Maiden song.\\"  The Legacy however is a song written by and prominantly features on guitar, none other than Janick Gers. So what the hell is D.Andrade talking about? <br /> <br />I happen to depend on many reviews on Amazon when deciding whether or not to purchase a cd and think many of them are helpful whether written postively or negatively.  I at least expect that the reviewer is honestly writing from an informed perspective.
B000AA7BNY|5.0|Several decades ago FM was where all the good music was played. AM was all pop, hype and commercials. However, occasionally powerful FM groups crossed from the relative obscurity of FM rock to AM rock, and when they were able to do so while retaining a measure of their artistic values the end result was usually either a killer song or a killer album; \\"Breakfast in America\\" is just such an album.<br /><br />How often do you see reviews raving about how great a song or album is? Very frequently. How often does the hype meet reality? Occasionally. In the case of this album the creativity and originality are incredibly high. A harmonica, clarinet, saxophone, piano and a score of other instruments are combined in a completely unique way with the vocals of two strong lead singers, creative lyrics and music to yield a work of musical art that became Supertramp's biggest seller and among their most readily accessible music.<br /><br />The vocal duties throughout the album are shared by Roger Hodgson and Richard Davies. The voice differences between the two singers provide a unique vocal contrast well-exploited on songs such as \\"Gone Hollywood.\\" The music is frequently pop, but the lyrics are highly poetic and complex, and rarely evoke throw away pop lyrics.<br /><br />The album spawned four hit singles, \\"The Logical Song,\\" \\"Goodbye Stranger,\\" \\"Breakfast in America,\\" and \\"Take the Long Way Home.\\" While the songs came across as pop, consider \\"The Logical Song.\\" The complexity of the music shows its progressive rock influence. In one place the lyrics are:<br /><br />There are times when all the world's asleep,<br /><br />the questions run too deep<br /><br />for such a simple man.<br /><br />won't you please, please tell me what we've learned<br /><br />I know it sounds absurd<br /><br />but please tell me who I am.<br /><br />Lyrics such as these are far from throw away pop lyrics and remind us of the progressive roots of Supertramp.<br /><br />While every song on this CD is a gem, there are a number of unique moments. During \\"Goodbye Stranger\\" there is a whistling accompaniment, and the whistling is incredibly pure and beautiful. The harmonica introduction to \\"Take the Long Way Home\\" is excellent and well-performed. Very few people would consider the harmonica to be an instrument for a rock song. There are also several places where Supertramp effectively reminds listeners that the piano is a percussion instrument.<br /><br />As powerful as much of the music is on this CD there are quite a few moments where the instruments are all acoustic and the song is quite mellow. The introduction to \\"Lord Is It Mine\\" with quiet singing and piano is one excellent example. Yet the song is decidedly rock.<br /><br />Given that Supertramp started as a progressive rock group, it would have been unusual to create an album without at least one strongly progressive song; \\"Child of Vision\\" is that song. There is an excellent extended bridge in this seven plus minute song where the background music and piano are in counterpoint, and where the piano is once again effectively used as a percussion instrument. This song is my favorite from the CD. However, I enjoy progressive rock and this song is the most clearly progressive song on the CD.<br /><br />There are moments in musical time where a group passes through a creative point where the music matches the sentiment of a broad range of listeners. Often those moments are when multiple musical styles are combined to create a fresh sound. \\"Breakfast in America\\" was one of those moments.gem, there are a number of unique moments.

B000HCO8IQ|5.0|I've listened to the cd several times now, and it's fantastic.  I am a huge fan of 70s music (rock, glam, pop, funk, disco), and I love how the Sisters have blended these styles together in a great updated style.  PLUS these songs have great lyrics.  My faves (right now) are I Don't Feel Like Dancin', Ooh, Lights, Paul McCartney, I Can't Decide, Might Tell You Tonight, and Everybody Wants The Same Thing.  The rest of the songs are also really good, and I could listen to the whole cd (except Intermission, because, although I like the lyrics, I don't like the vaudeville sound).    You can tell a lot of thought and effort went into this album, and I think a few listens will convince most people that Ta-Dah is a brilliant cd. I've made a playlist with my favorite songs from both albums and moving back and forth between the albums is great - the songs from each cd really balance each other.    Do yourself a favor... buy/download the cd, make your own mix playlist from the two albums, and crank it up.
B0007WZX9O|4.0|Any group with a catalog that includes albums such as \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\" along with their numerous other releases will forever have to live up to their reputation. In the hands of other groups \\"The Division Bell\\" would be considered a high-water mark in their repertoire; in the hands of Pink Floyd this is just another competent, beautiful album.<br /><br />The album opens with the instrumental \\"Cluster One,\\" featuring the sounds of Mother Earth herself. The music is quiet, thoughtful; an introspective introduction that provides a flavor of things to come, and perhaps reminds you that this CD is a Pink Floyd CD; you can expect art, a touch of this, a touch of that, and it will be tinged with progressive elements.<br /><br />The stronger elements of \\"What Do You Want from Me\\" contrast nicely with the opening piece. The song has elements that date back to \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\" While the work breaks little new ground for Floyd, it is the reliability and quality of the music and lyrics that make it so addictive. This music is the same while being different. Those contrasting guitar chords are Floyd. \\"Poles Apart\\" follows in a similar vein. However, the power of the lyrics of \\"Poles Apart\\" pulls you into the imagery painted by the combination of the music and lyrics. Once again the keyboards remind me of \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\"<br /><br />The fourth track, \\"Marooned,\\" is okay. This instrumental track may fit with the theme of the introduction, but is otherwise uninspired. The instrumental is pleasant and mellow, an accompaniment to floating clouds and mellow water surrounded by whispering spring trees; music to get dreamy by.<br /><br />When I first heard the lyrics of \\"A Great Day for Freedom,\\" I thought it related to the breaking down of barriers between East and West at the end of the cold war. Multiple listening now convinces me that the song has more to do with the departure of Roger Waters than anything else. The music is mellow and good, but to use the lyrics as may have been done distracts from my enjoyment of a musically good song.<br /><br />While the music of \\"Wearing the Inside Out\\" starts with a jazz flavor, or may even remind a listener of Vangelis's \\"Blade Runner\\" music, the lyrics are surreal and hint at paranoia and being left out. Richard Wright's music retains only a hint of Pink Floyd's usual musical style and while the change in flavor may provide some needed variation, the variation is also is too noticeable to a focused listener. This track is one of my less favorite on this CD.<br /><br />I like the music and the lyrics of \\"Take It Back.\\" There is a strong pop beat to this song, but it is so listenable and the lyrics are complex so that it is an enjoyable song. My only objection is the pop-like repetitive lyric at the end of the song. The harmony is well done, but the repetition is annoying.<br /><br />The lyrics of \\"Coming Back to Life\\" are evocative. The song is a lament,  a seeking, a journey, a vision, an ending and a new beginning. It is amazing that David Gilmour managed to squeeze so much into the sparse lyrics of this song. While this song retains some of the pop flavor of \\"Take It Back,\\" the lyrics will challenge an analytical listener and turns what could have been a mundane song into a good listen.<br /><br />\\"Keep Talking\\" uses a bit of a gimmick with the synthesized voice of physicist, cosmologist and author Stephen Hawking used at several places in the song. I like this song with its Pink Floyd style. However, I keep thinking that this song sounds similar in places to another song I heard on an early Pink Floyd album; I am just unable to pinpoint the song. Perhaps the style is so strongly similar to early Pink Floyd that I keep thinking this is a song from \\"Wish You Were Here.\\"<br /><br />The song \\"Lost for Words\\" is a song of frustration. How can you help overcome the differences between you and those who may be your enemies? This songreally has no answer to the question, but how many songs of any genre use the words \\"doldrums\\" and \\"cauldron,\\" particularly in the same song? For a while the vocals have a bit of a Bob Dylan feel to them, particularly in the opening stanza. Later we hear the sound of a boxing match in the bridge leading into a stronger, more Floyd style vocal. This song also contains a four-letter word that I am unable to recall having seen in a Pink Floyd song. I was a bit surprised by the inclusion, though it fits well with the theme.<br /><br />The last track, \\"High Hopes,\\" is my favorite on this CD. It is progressive and strong and a wonderful way to finish off a CD. My opinion of this CD was strongly flavored by this last track that contains so many musical elements. The song in introduced with bells and a haunting piano. The initial vocals are dark and plaintive. The lyrics are full of unrealized futures and lost pasts, a feeling that we are coming to the end. The tolling of bells and the heavy bass are sad and nostalgic.  While it would be easy to accept the end as depressing, it is the well-executed artistry of this song that makes me happy rather than the sadness of the song. I hope for a return of Floyd.<br /><br />This solid CD is a worthy addition to Pink Floyd's catalog. We can only hope that there might yet be something released in the future from this ground-breaking and influential group.  This version is an import; other versions are available!<br /><br />Enjoy!be your enemies?

B000002KD9|5.0|Neil Young has made a lot of classic rock albums through the years: Everyone Knows This is Nowhere, On the Beach, Tonight's the Night, Rust Never Sleeps, Sleeps With Angels, etc.    But I don't think Neil has ever made an album as beautiful as After the Gold Rush. \\"Tell Me Why\\" has gorgeous vocal harmonies and an achingly lovely lead vocal from Neil. That last statement is also true of the title track and \\"Only Love Can Break Your Heart.\\"    And this album also contains one of Neil Young's best extended rockers to balance out all of the mellow songs that dominate this cd (Southern Man).     There is also a cover of \\"Oh, Lonesome Me\\" and a tender \\"I Believe in You.\\" The tempp picks up with \\"When You Dance You can Really Love,: and the cd concludes with a song reminiscent of the Band (Cripple Creek Ferry).    This is a short, but sweet Neil Young cd. It is worth your dollars.
B000006045|5.0|Easily this ecclectic group's best album, \\"Mezzanine\\" is really a strong testament to how well developed this band's sound became up to this point in their carreer. Although this album suffers a bit on the back end, the first 4 tracks (skipping the 5th track) and then the 6th track are probably the best rapid succession of trip-hop (with a darker, more organic edge) songs one could wish to hear. My only complaint is that the final five songs can almost be dismissed although to do so would probably not allow the first bunch of songs shine as much as they do.
B000G75AE8|2.0|I've been, like many others here, a Slayer fan for too many years to count.  I've enjoyed their highlights, such as Decade of Aggression (best live album, in my opinion) and slogged through their lows (Diabolus in Musica comes to mind).  God Hates Us All was an eye-opener for me.  So much rage, hate and anger all packaged nicely into a handful of songs.  It wasn't their classic sound, no, but I thought the heaviness of the album was very fitting to the band.  Patiently, I've waited all these years only to purchase a big pile.  There is not one song on here that really stands out, that makes me anxious with anticipation, that makes me want to... anything.  There is no inspiration in this album.  A few songs sound like they might have flashes of brilliance in them, but they are gone just as quickly as they came.  I quit listening to death metal years ago because I got tired of the fast-pace tempo changes that seem to invade each of these songs just as they get good.  I strongly suggest that people buy any of the other Slayer albums, but not this one.

B000CNESU8|5.0|Network tells the story of Howard Beale, an aclaimed TV anchor who recives notice he will be fired in two weeks due to poor ratings, leading him to anounce he will commit suicide in one week. when this is announced, the media goes into a frenzy and suddenly the ratings are through the roof and Howard Beale becomes a cultural obbsession. Network does what it does best, completly poke fun at the news buisness and never deviates from it. all the performences are supurb, the two standouts being Peter Finch and Faye Dunaway. Peter Finch as Howard Beale is full of energy and when he does those onscreen rantes he is at top form. Dunaway perfectly embodies the extremly cold-hearted media head Diana Christensen. there are also small gems to be found in the film, most notably Beatrice Straight as the neglected wife of news program head Max Shumacher. though she's on screen for little under six minutes, her performance just sticks with you through out the film. respectivly, all three of these actos took home an oscar that year (the first since A Streetcar Named Desire). it has also become a classic and is apart of AFI's top 100 movies. so if you truley want to see a great film with great acting, this is the one for you. it may even have you sticking out your head through the window and yelling \\"i'm as mad as hell and i'm not going to take this anymore!\\"
0060934913|5.0|I love this book!!! I worked in the restaurant business for 10 years. Now that I have a \\"real job\\", I find myself missing the crazy work hours of reataurant life. I miss the people, because really, restaurant people are like no other. You either belong in the business or you don't.<br /><br />This book is just perfect.
0618680004|5.0|However, reading this book makes me sad because the people who need to read it most and be open minded about it will bash it and completely demonstrate that they haven't really read what has been written.  Some of the negative reviews here already show that. <br /> <br />It's so utterly obvious with the knowledge we have today that \\"god is dead\\".  god was no more alive than santa claus is.  why so many of us (me included until 5 years ago) believe in fairy tales is beyond me.  i can only hope that this well-written and cogent set of arguments against irrational belief helps assuage the rising religious state that is rising in the united states.  contrary to popular belief, this is NOT a nation founded on christianity.  i've known this since i was a boy in Lutheran grammar school!  one only needs to read a couple of thomas jefferson quotes on the topic of religion to realize the goal was, quite wisely, secular government.   <br /> <br />i have strong fears that this country can be salvaged from the \\"i don't really think about these things and just believe\\" heap.  i hope so my friends.  i try to speak with whoever will listen (friends and acquaintances) about this to help spread the truth, but have very little impact ultimately. <br /> <br />thanks richard dawkins for another classic book--his writing style is just superb and clear.  i already can't wait for the next one.
0060776757|5.0|The pictures alone are worth the price of this book.  I was expecting to  read the story of how U2 came to be what it is today. However, I was not expecting to read how music entered U2's lives espically in such a candid and humorous way.  <br /> <br />This may very well set a new standard for rock biographies...   <br /> <br />BUY THIS BOOK!! You won't regret it!
B00001ODGR|5.0|Oh wow one of Styx's most famous concerts for me to see whenever I please. When I got this I flipped out. I couldn't believe it. I was the luckiest man alive. I watched this thing over and over and over and I'm still not tired of it. 17 of their best songs performed live. I particularly liked \\"Rockin' The Paradise\\", \\"Blue Collar Man (Long Nights)\\", \\"Lady\\", \\"Show Me The Way\\", \\"Fooling Yourself (The Angry Young Man)\\", \\"Babe\\", \\"Come Sail Away\\", \\"Renegade\\", \\"Lorelei\\", \\"Too Much Time On My Hands\\", \\"Snowblind\\", \\"Miss America\\", \\"Crystal Ball\\", \\"The Best Of Times\\", \\"Grand Illusion\\", \\"Suite Madame Blue\\" and \\"Boat On The River\\" those are my favorite songs on this DVD. This is a must have for any Styx fan whther you new to them or you are a seasoned veteran.
B000HA4W4S|4.0|With the deserved help of Sir Elton John on, \\"I Don't Feel Like Dancing\\", The Scissor Sisters continue on their unique road to pop glory.  This is more of the same glam-rock, disco, dance ballad mixture that got them noticed on their debut and it still manages to work.  \\"Ta-Dah\\" is electric metrosexual Bee Gees, except the vocals are simply Scissor Sisters (and that's fine).  The dance beat is not quite as funky as the Gibbs dance period, but it's much, much more current.  There is no doubt that the Sisters have created a niche long lost thrown away and have brought new life to it.  Sure, they aren't quite Blondie, the Bee Gees or Elton john, but they sure get damn close and with the mix of all of these influences, they soar on nearly every song to a frenzied euphoria.  The Scissor Sisters have been said to be the musical equivalent of  \\"Jacks of all trades and masters of none\\", but they sure master what they have here and that is a feat in itself.
B00003CWL6|5.0|this is one of my FAVORITE movies. i highly recommand it to be in your movie collection. the music in the film is moving. the film itself is amazing :) enjoy <br />
B000G8NXYG|5.0|It's about time that one of the best films ever made received a little preferential treatment. There is so much to this DVD you couldn't possibly be disappointed. Not to mention it is so beautifully put together you might not want to open it.  <br /> <br />The master would be proud.
0316743003|5.0|This is a great book, full of facts.  It is very interesting to see the planes as they develop.  I enjoyed all the different views supplied by the Airforce, the Engineers, the Pilots and the Government officials.  The book cantains some foul language.  Very interesting and totally enjoyable.  Good technical information.  Covers: Stealth, U2 and the Blackbird very well.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|I made a big mistake in purchasing this dvd.  I thought it would be good to commemorate such a famous broadway musical by buying the commemorative edition dvd.  Well, unbeknownst to me, this musical was a horrible, horrible turd.  Granted I don't like musicals, animals OR broadway, but I thought this would be worth a shot.  Well, the only thing getting a shot now is ME....cause I need 30 CC's of Uncrapulator to get this crapfest out of my mind.  There is so much poop in my brain now that it's hard to know the difference between when I'm thinking and when the poo is just shifting around.  I have to keep my head completely still, or else my ears fart and poo shoots on my wall.  it's totally embarassing.  Sorry for being so graphic, but I'm just trying to save you the same embarassment.  Thanks SO MUCH, Cats the Musical (Commemorative Edition)...you have ruined my life.        That being said, the song Jellicle Cats is really awesome and this dvd is worth watching just for the fun of that one song.  For that reason, I give this five stars.  But remember, if you don't want your head to burst in an armageddon-style explosion of turds, ONLY watch that one scene.  I'm not kidding, man.  I've had to stop typing three different times so that I could wipe the turds off my monitor with a washcloth.  (Again, sorry for being so graphic.)    DVD- No stars.  Jellicle Cats song - Five Stars!!!!

B000AXSN5G|5.0|This is an essential Neil Young album. Taking yet another turn in his long, interesting and forever relevant career Neil follows a country rock muse and his words and music is delivered in a heltfelt and moving way that is straight from his soul. Neil faced several personal traumas during 2005, not the least the death of his father and his own health concerns which he has since rebounded from in emphatic fashion. <br /> <br />The Painter opens this strong set with its whistful acoustic guitar progression and gentle steel pedal guitar giving it a real country feel. You will note that his voice is as tender and melodic as it has ever been. This song was nominated for a Grammy and it ain't hard to see why. \\"If you follow every dream, you might get lost\\" <br /> <br /> <br />As someone else pointed out, No Wonder is vintage Neil Young in every sense of the statement. It is really melodic and has great tempo changes. He may as well have recorded this with CSNY all those years ago. Being a guitar player I rate this his best acoustic riff since My My Hey Hey. \\"no wonder were loosing time\\" <br /> <br />Falling Of The Face of The Earth features a rough around the edges falsetto, that's the great thing about Neil, he doesn't care if his songs are not 100% perfect technically. Just listen to the words and the music.  <br /> <br />Far From Home kicks up the dust a bit, here we have a joyous uptempo song where Neil recalls his upbringing on the Prairie, \\"those were the good family times that left a big mark on me\\"  <br /> <br />It's A Dream is enough to bring a tear in ones eye. It is such a beautiful song, one of the best he ever did, for sure one of his best melodies and musical arrangements. <br /> <br />Prarie Wind features some female backup singers and is more of an uptempo song with Neil exercising his vocals a little. <br /> <br />Here For You is similar to a song you would find on his \\"Comes A Time\\" album. It features lovely pedal steel guitar and harmonica from Neil. There is a vulnerable warble to his voice. <br /> <br />This Old Guitar is about how the guitar will outlive its owner. Neil plays Hank Williams guitar on the DVD Heart Of Gold which I highly recommend as he plays this song on the guitar, along with the other songs from this album and several acoustic classics spanning his career. <br /> <br />\\"Were gonna start in an F\\"?, son Ben agrees so Neil begins his goofy little song about the king that adds a light hearted moment to this largely introspective album.  <br /> <br />The final track, \\"When God Made Me\\" has a lovely spiritual tone and was a fitting performance at the Katrina Benefit Concert.  <br /> <br />This is one of Neils best and consistent albums and I rank it up with his very best that includes Rust Never Sleeps, Harvest, Everyone Knows This Is Nowhere, After The Goldrush and On The Beach. <br /> <br />Neil Young is a gift to the world, and there is no one like him, thankyou Neil for keeping it real, after all of these years, still rocking in the free world. You are Mr Soul. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00000IFWE|5.0|While anticipating Tom Petty's latest album, I decided to revisit some of his earlier catalogue and found this CD in my stack of \\"to be burned and returned\\" CDs. Am I ever glad that I rescued it! This is one of his strongest albums in the past twenty years if not his whole career. I think I am at a different place in my life now that I can really appreciate all of the emotions on display here, in his case inspired by a divorce. This album is by turns whistful, rollicking, heartbreaking, bitter, sad and hopeful. The standouts include Room at the Top, Swingin, Counting on You, Rhino Skin and the title track. My only complaint is one that I see in many Rick Rubin-produced albums and that is that there is just too much. There are about three songs that could have easily been edited out to make a masterpiece from start to finish. I personally find this to be a much stronger album than the much-touted Wildflowers and it is a shame that it is so overlooked. Take it from me, if you're a Petty fan or just a fan of good music in general, revisit this album. You won't be dissapointed!
B000H305U0|1.0|I am not a Justin hater.  I bought his last CD and this one and have seen him in concert but I think this CD sucks.  There are like 2 or 3 good songs and the rest are just a bunch of dribble.  He hardly even has any vocals on most of the songs.  You can't even tell most of the tracks are Justin songs.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Five minutes into the first episode, I knew the show had me hooked. It centers around two brothers making a desperate search of the paranormal for the creature that viciously attacked their mother and incinerated her in the family nursery. Dean, the elder of the two, is much more family-oriented. Tough on the outside but with a softer heart than he would like to admit, he's something of a ladies' man but when it comes to kicking demon backside, there's none better. Sam, the younger, by contrast, is something of an unwilling recruit, joining the ranks of ghost-slayers only because of the loss of his girlfriend, Jess. Throughout the first season, the boys meet and destroy a different evil being each week, while learning more about one another, themselves, and their elusive father, John. <br /> <br />The DVD set is very nicely packaged. I was happy that the pilot episode is back to its normal length -- when it premiered on television, several minor scenes were cut and/or trimmed to adjust the running length. I had seen the full-length pilot online and thus was disappointed in the changes, but it's back to normal now. The only complaint I have is that I have had trouble with the final disk. The last episode sometimes plays, and sometimes freezes up and/or skips ahead, leading me to believe there may be a problem with the disk's internal formatting. Believing it was just an issue with my player, I asked around and it turns out several of my friends have had the same problem. It's really a shame, because the last episode is admittedly the best of the season.
B00005JPAD|5.0|I don't think it's fair to have low expectations of this movie simply because it's a remake of a Hong Kong film. Hollywood has done some decent work, and this movie has a great director guiding it. It also has an amazing cast - Damon and Sheen, not to mention Nicholson, who's one of the best actors around.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|It's funny, sweet, and sad all rolled into one.  The interweaving of the stories was great.  In addition to the movie, the bonus features are very interesting.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Songwriting and music equals that of A Rush of Blood to the Head. Possibly a more mature sound.
0743298020|5.0|I bought this book totally thinking that it was going to be another ghost story... I was sooo wrong! I thought I knew what was going on, but I had to change my mind so many times that I decided to just wait impatiently and find out \\"the truth\\". The characters are great, all dark and with a secret/sad story behind them. The writing is great, never slow, it makes you want to turn the next page, if you know what I mean. A great tale of mistery and not ordinary love. <br />A great debut for Ms. Setterfield!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Any Floyd fan is aware of the scarcity of video content of this legendary group.  Unfortunately without Roger Waters,  Pulse's performance of Dark Side of the Moon (in entirety, in sequence) is nevertheless an incredible display of talent, presented in a stunning light show.  The second DVD presents a superb performance of Floyd's non-DSofMoon hits.  This is a must-get DVD for Floyd fans,  especially those who have a home theater system.
B000G75AE8|5.0|First off, nothing inspires bladder-busting laughs quite like reviewers who like Slayer- except for all the stuff about Satan. <br /> <br />\\"Yeah, I like \\"Enter the Dragon,\\" except the parts when them Chinese fellers Kung Fu each other.\\" <br /> <br />It's Slayer. What kind of moron buys an album titled, \\"Christ Illusion\\" and then whines about anti-Christian content? Are your parents cousins or something? If you want to rock for the Lord then go listen to Creed. <br /> <br />With that said, I f*cking LOVE this album! Not one track drags, and I especially love the lyrics. Namely, \\"Skeleton Christ,\\" \\"Consfearacy,\\" and \\"Cult.\\" <br /> <br />I know a lot of Alabama yokels have their panties in a wad because \\"Jihad\\" is written from a Muslim terrorist point of view (I'm sure if it was written from Timothy McVeigh's point of view they'd have no complaint).  <br /> <br />Look. It's a song. Did Jello Biafra really want to \\"Kill the Poor?\\" No. And may I remind you that \\"213\\" was written from Jeffrey Dahmer's point of view. Does that mean Jeff Hanneman wants to drill holes in young black men's skulls to make sex zombies? I haven't asked Jeff yet, but I'm pretty sure he doesn't. So stop b!tching. <br /> <br />That's what Slayer does. They exploit horror and shove it down your throat. And this album acheives that quite well. <br /> <br />Another reviewer called this album 'something old and something new.' That's pretty accurate. There's the speed and ferocity of albums like \\"Hell Awaits,\\" which is my favorite, and modernized breaks and tempo changes, and the aforementioned lyrics befitting of the current political climate. <br /> <br />So if you're actually a Slayer fan and not Tipper Gore, you'll love this album.  <br /> <br />Long live the King. SLAYER!!!
B000001A3H|3.0|Kyuss are pretty good, and this is their best album, but if you want to hear some real, punishingly heavy, unbelievably distorted acid-rock you have to hear the double guitar attack of the Gibbons brothers.  And that means you have to go to Bardo Pond on this site and listen to the samples of \\"Tommy Gun Angel\\" or \\"Flux\\" on the album Lapsed.  All it will take is 30 seconds of each to hear what's missing here.  Even if you're bugged that I seem to be dissing your band, give the Pond a listen anyway.
B000001FN8|5.0|I can't understand people saying this album doesn't rock. It certainly rocks and it's one of Scorpions' best!!<br /><br />In my opinion, all of Scorpions albums from In trance to Savage Amusement deserve 5 stars and no less. I agree witht the other reviewer that says that it's a shame that Don't stop at the top didn't become a classic. Yeah, I'd surely love to hear it in every Scorpions' concert! When this album was released I was still in high school, and great memories come to my mind everytime I listen to it. Some people may say the lyrics are silly, I have to disagree, they rock! Don't stop at the top has certainly contributed to the philosophy of my life!<br /><br />This is also one of the most solid Scorpions albums, no weak points in here, most songs are worth 5 stars (I would give 6 stars to Walking in the edge).<br /><br />It's a shame that the band no longer considers this one as of their most important records, and often play in concerts only \\"Rhythm of love\\"  (an excellent song, by the way). I can't believe how can they play more songs from Crazy World (a much more uneven record). Scorpions surely did experience a very serious decay during the 90's, but in this new decade they have kept on digging the hole. They have not only offered two horrible live albums (Acoustica and the Berliner Philamorniker), but the \\"Unbreakable\\" comeback (what a horrible title!! It reminds me of Michael Jackson, I don't know why), which many say it rocks and I only say it bores (Eye to eye is better than that).<br /><br />Savage amusement is a lost gem that every true Scorpions fan must own!!This is an essential!!!! Scorpions at the top (before they dropped!)
B000H7JD4K|4.0|Well, there are so many reviews of this album that I doubt i'll be able to add anything new, but I'll try. IM sounds totally alive and re-invigorated on this album, it's much more consistent than 'Dance of Death' which had some great moments but overall was kind of weak! I'm glad Steve Harris decided against mastering it, I think he made the right decision, it's so in your face. The intricate melodies, riffs, etc. are all over the place, and the lyrics are a definite step up for Maiden, as they (mostly) move into dealing with contemporary issues. I agree with some reviewers that Bruce can't hit all those high notes anymore, but he's still an amazing singer. The other thing I'd like to encourage listeners/posters to do is to listen to the album 4-5 times before you form an opinion, there is so much going on in every song and takes a lot of listens to really sink in and fully absorb! Other than 'Lord Of Light' I don't think there is a weak moment on this CD, and even that song is good, just not great. It's amazing that almost 30 years into a career that a band can deliver such a passionate album, but I guess that is what makes IM so special! If you are a fan, run out and get it. Believe the hype!!!
B000002B30|4.0|Its amazing that SO many folks WHINE over the non-inclusion of certain songs, \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze Out\\" \\"Rosalita\\" and just about everything else!  Dont all you BBBBRRRRRRUUUUUUCCCCCCCCEEEEEEE diehards (not Cockburn either) know what was on this one when reviewing it?  There's the bias right there!!!   Better yet, why complain at all,  being HEAVILY PREDISPOSED to certain tracks anyway?  The point?  Look this is a very good retropective release of music's most known singer/songwriter/ikon of the century!!!  There are plenty of styles of music represented here -for the novice ardent or \\"whomever\\" fan of his!!!  <br />I rate this 4 stars because of the annoying comments previously made!  Ouch!!!!   <br />BTW, why didnt anyone MENTION that NILS LOFGREN was Bruce's main guitarist for \\"how many years\\" 90's period , right?!  Let it alone, that HE TOO has an incredible catalogue of music out there as well (incl his 2002 Live Double Disk release!) along with his GRIN albums from the mid 70's. Dont be so harsh...its bad for the digestive system, kidz!!!  Peace out
0966638328|4.0|This book is a great place to start when you've jumped into a project and have no idea of what direction you're going to go with color.<br /><br />With a color guide broken down by 'moods' (e.g., blue:  dependable, cool; green: refreshing, healing), you can pan through the book and start brainstorming in your mind of what directions to go.<br /><br />You then get into the display listing of colors broken down by moods such as:  mellow, serene, spiritual.<br /><br />One of the great features of the book is the color conversion appendix which correlates each Pantone color to it's CMYK equivalent.  This is priceless when you're preparing a process color job for press.<br /><br />Certainly not the be-all-and-end-all of color books, but a great resource to have on your desk!
0440219078|5.0|When I first read The Giver I was still a child and I loved it!  It was thought provoking novel that kept the reader wanting more.  I recently re-read the book and enjoyed it more than ever.  It is about a young boy named Jonah who lives in the perfect society.  There is no crime, no war, no pain, and nothing to hurt the inhabitants.  However, there is also no happiness or love.  When Jonah turns twelve, he is instructed that he is to become the new receiver of memories and take the place of the previous one.  Jonah has no idea what this involves and is excited to learn.  The job is not what he expected and is about to discover all the secrets that have been hidden from him, and the entire town, his whole life. <br />   If you have read Brave New World by Aldous Huxley and enjoyed it, or have been a reader of Lois Lowry, this book is a must read!  Enjoyable at any age, The Giver is truly an astounding novel.
0618164413|5.0|We have an older version of this same book.  This book was a gift to our oldest son when he was 2.  13 years later, this very well read book is again our 4th sons favorite book.  I'm continually amazed at how much each of our children treasured this book.  A must have for any family library.
B000HCO8IQ|5.0|What does that mean? On Friday, after getting off a hard work week you need something to pick you up and set the mood for the weekend - and that's where the Scissor Sisters debut album stands. By Saturday, you need something just a little more outrageous to get your blood pumping and kick into full party mode - thus, Ta'Dah, their sophomore album does just that. On first listening I thought the album had some good songs but just didn't live up to the brilliance of their first album and was slightly disappointed. Then, while doing things around the house, I put it on again and BAM! The jam-packed effect of this album hit me full force. All the \\"poor\\" songs I thought I heard on first listening slide into their proper place in my brain and next thing I knew I was dancing around the house and wanting more. I was wishing it was a weekend because I wanted to get out of the house and go to a club and enjoy this masterpiece in its proper arena. This album proves that the Scissor Sisters are here to stay.
0723257639|5.0|The 23 original tales by Beatrix Potter comes in a sturdy presentation box. All 23 tales are of the original art work and are beautifully made. The books are small for little hands (just the way Beatrix Potter wanted them). The stories are classic and completely timless and brings backs many memories of childhood. They are perfect for adults and their little ones.
038073186X|4.0|I've just got done reading Shutter Island the second time this morning. Obviously, the first reading impressed me enough to warrant a second read. The first reading must have had me completely engrossed because I did not guess what was going on right up to the end. I found the characters interesting and fully fleshed out. They needed to be to make sense of patient's paranoid delusions. In Terry's delusional state, none of the medical or nursing staff are what he believes them to be.<br /><br />Anyway, I swallowed my first reading hook, line, and sinker. Yeah, I thought it was a little weird when Teddy's partner Chuck disappeared and the guards made such a big deal about preventing a U.S. Marshall from leaving the island. But I bought it until the end and found the story very compelling. This is obvious, since I just got done rereading the book.<br /><br />Reading a book like this - even a couple years apart - allows for a whole different perspective when reviewing the book. I had remembered the gist of the story but not the details. During the second read I started to pick up on more clues that made the ending more expected and lead me to more criticisms of the book.<br /><br />While reading the negative reviews (mostly two or three sentence reviews, most of which had been written by readers who didn't even finish the book for various reasons), I kept a list of the most common complaints. Here they are in no particular order:<br />* Comparison to the Sixth Sense - these stories have little in common. The Sixth Sense had to do with communication with the dead - actual communication between a boy and ghost.<br />* Shutter Island has no references to the supernatural. Instead it deals with an individual who is delusional (fabricating an entirely new reality) and a paranoid schizophrenic.<br />* Confusing story - I found the storyline easy to follow and each character was distinct up until the final part of the book when Teddy moves from a rational state back to a delusional persona and we have to change our perceptions of who's who.<br />* Storyline difficult to follow. I realize that words of more that five or six letters can confuse some people, making it more difficult to understand the book. This is a common complaint when books have many characters and locations. The only problem I had was trying to envision the landscape that Terry was describing.<br />* No idea what was going on. This I find difficult to understand. It was an easy read, taking me two days to complete. The story was fairly chronological with the exception of Teddy's flashbacks regarding the war and his life with his wife. Once the reader realizes that pretty much everything that involves Terry directly is part of his delusions and his inability to deal with the harrowing fact that his wife killed their three children and then he, in turn, killed her, makes things a little more clearer.<br />* For some reason unknown to me, a reviewer (giving one *) had a problem with the use of plastic in the novel. I'm in the dark here. I don't have any specific recollection of plastic being used. I guess that whatever the reviewer was complaining about had much to do with the fact that the year is only 1954. Well, plastics have been around since the 1800s so I don't imagine their use (in whatever capacity) to be that farfetched.<br />* Another criticism was that prison locks controlled by electricity were not in use in 1954 is not something that I have been able to confirm or deny. Even today, some penitentiaries still use the old lock and key method. I don't know when electrical security systems came into place and who cares anyway.<br />* Many people gave negative reviews based on the fact that Shutter Island was so different from the author's other books. I had never read any of Lehane's other books so this had no influence on me as I read this book.<br /><br />One criticism that I have to agree with (and I even felt a little uncomfortable about this with the first read) is that Teddy/Andrew was given full run of the entire island only to prove to one set of doctors that this inmate could be cured of his delusions and violent proclivities. What were these doctors' thinking?  I realize that they were willing to try anything to save their patient from more radical (psychosurgical) intervention. But this was a really unethical way to go about doing it. It placed in danger the staff, other inmates (especially taking into the account the history of his violent behavior a couple weeks before the experiment), and to the subject himself. This guy was psychotic, delusional, and possibly a paranoid schizophrenic - they just don't snap out of it. Maybe this was not fully understood in 1954 but these conditions are caused by chemical imbalances in the brain, just as diabetes is caused the body's inability to produce enough insulin.<br /><br />In 1954, the evil doctors waiting for Crawley's experiment to fail planned to subdue Teddy/Andrew with the immoral, unethical, and unproved treatment by transorbital lobotomy.

B000002KOO|5.0|I bought this CD after reading about Peter Green in Guitar Player magazine.  I was just amazed at what a great player he was.  Oh, Well is the highlght of the CD and is one of the best songs you will ever hear.  After listening to this CD you need to go to Snapper Music's web page and buy Fleetwood Mac's Live at the Boston Tea Party Vol 1 and Vol 2.  Peter Green and Danny Kerwin are outstanding and Jeremy Spencer plays an amazing slide.  The CDs were remastered and the sound is great.  Best of all it won't cost you an arm and a leg.

6304698623|5.0|We just picked this up at the library as a family friendly movie.  We are ordering it ASAP.  I don't know how many times I cried during this movie.  The little girls in the movie were so genuine - especially the main character.  The whole package was just enchanting and magical.  No special affects.  Just a good old fashioned story of the strength of the imagination and the power of friendship.   <br /> <br />We ARE all princes and princesses!
B00005JOQS|5.0|I thought it was quite wonderful, but enough of that has been heard.  I found out this morning (I hope it is true) that Superman Returns should be arriving on DVD on November 28.  I have no other details, just that.  Have a great day!
B00005JMAH|5.0|The best of the four first Harry Potter's movies. Good part of the merit falls on the sensitive and atmospherical direction of Alfonso Cuaron ( \\" Great expectations \\" ) who gives to the film a more carefulness plastic treatment and darker content. The film contains some excellent sequences as that one, that at time is a big lesson of fine pedagogy, in which the boys must learn to identify and fight theirs own fears, a sequence plenty of healthy humour and creative cinematographic invention, or that impossible other, that help us to complete the holes of the immediatly previous sequence, in which Harry turns down the Time to change the course of the events with the precious and unconscious collaboration of himself ( Harry meets himself in the past ). Although the film follows the general plot and basic narrative scheme of the book, many lines have been rewritten and some scenes deleted in benefit of the sensitive body of the movie.      Widescreen double-DVD edition.
0618680004|1.0|Religion is man made.  Therefore I agree with Dawkings that being of domestic origin, all of them are flawed. BUT one truth evades his theory. That creation in all its violence, beauty, discipline and awesomeness has the signatures of intelligence, wisdom, order, and perhaps purpose. This entire universe, whether it began with an amoeba, a grain of sand or an explosion, bear the signatures of supreme insight and intelligence. Some call this entity, God, Allah, Zeus, or whatever. But Man, in his futile attempt to answer unanswerable questions created religion. Only a Supreme Being, bearded or not and impossible for us to visualize or comprehend had the capacity to create the greatest miracle known to Man, that of Creation itself. Nothing comes from nothing, and scientists know that. Man's intelligence, his spirituality and human characteristics have shown a sacred inclination to accept and communicate with a Supreme Entity ever since the stone Age.<br />\\"The God Delusion\\" is another arrogant attempt to pit science against the omniscience and omnipresence of God. Common sense tells me that scientists in particular should be the ones promoting the existence of a Supreme Being regardless of how we name Him.<br />One common denominator shown throughout Dawkin's theory is that the more controversial a book is and the more it challenges the minds of the weak, the more dollars it brings to the author's pocket.<br /><br />Andrew J.

These daily meditations aren't dated, so you can begin anywhere, anytime--either reading consecutive meditations or choosing one at random.<br /><br />Some of the themes in Daily Guidance from Your Angels include:<br /><br />* Be Gentle With Yourself<br />* Say Goodbye to Guilt<br />* Honor Your Agreements<br />* Bless Your Meals<br />* Complete Projects<br />* Turn Around Nervousness<br />* Know That You're Perfectly Understood By Us<br />* Detach From Drama<br />* Connect With the Spirit of Nature<br />* Enjoy a Sense of Belonging<br />* Know That You Can Never Ask for Too Much<br />* Honor Your Sensitivity<br />* Listen to Your Inner Child<br />* Expect Everything to Go Well<br /><br />I've consulted this book at random several times, and I've found each insight rich with liberating, practical wisdom.

B000H305U0|2.0|Sorry, but i'm quite disappointed with this album, but more specifically, Sexyback. <br /> <br />Justified was much better an album and Justin Timberlake's own style was apparent. <br /> <br />This one however, i'm not sure what he's trying to do. Is he trying to bring out a new side of him? Or merely attempting to imitate trance-ish dance music? To me, being a regular listener of electronic music, Sexyback is a mediocre dancey/trancey type of track.
B000GRUS22|2.0|Compared to the past releases this is the most repetitive and there is no creative 'breakout' in any of the songs.  Once the song starts.......this is what you get throughout the song.  No big tempo changes that Cretu was famous for in the past.  Previous songs would stop on a dime in some cases and move into a completely different direction that were literally awe inspiring.  None of that here. <br />Enigma has become no different than any of your other run of the mill trance artists.  It's the Enigma sound but compositionally it is boring.  This may be a good 'dance' album but that's it.  Not inspirational at all.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm pretty much late in hopping into the \\"Firefly\\" bandwagon, this DVD was always mentioned as a top buy--so when I saw it on sale I took a chance and said what-the-heck. Boy am I glad I did! This series is dead-on excellent, after the first few episodes I kept wanting to watch the next one. Too bad it's a short run, hopefully some network will wise up and pick it up and let Serenity and it's jolly crew take off again. \\"Burn the land, boil the sea -- you can't take the sky from me.\\" -- opening sequence...
B000GG4KTU|2.0|Diana Krall has always been a Artist that I respected Her talent,but I never quite got the full buzz over,but over her past two albums I'm really lost now,because Her voice doesn't work well in a bigger band enviroment. She is better suited in a smaller unit that allows her instrument of voice to be heard&given that feel she is known for doing in her material. there is way too much going on in the overall sounds&they don't blend with her vocally enough. She doesn't have enough in her Chops to keep up with what she is trying to pull off here. I applaud the effort,but she has to get back to what best compliments her stylings.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Clearly, seeing the musical first can give one a biased understanding of the movie, but even for movie fans who have not seen The Phantom of the Opera on stage, this musical will not disappoint.  If you taken the combination of cinematic elements--visuals, music, acting, etc--Phantom scores high marks across the board.  Specifically: <br /> <br />-Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler perform great acts of redemption from previously perceived bad films (The Day After Tomorrow and Tomb Raider, respectively).  Seeing the cast, I was a little skeptical, but the cast performs beyond expectations.  Rossum in particular peforms the role of Christine with a charm and voice that grabs the viewer.  Very enticing. Butler also does well, but more on him later. <br /> <br />-Andrew Lloyd Webber, the original writer for Phantom, was involved in the screenplay, which was a brilliant move on the part of the production team.  His involvement undoubtedly facilitated the transition of the story from stage to screen, as the various elements of the story align almost perfectly with the Broadway rendition.  This cannot be underestimated; had Webber not been involved, the movie could very well have turned a 180 in terms of quality. <br /> <br />-the music; all of Webber's songs appear in the movie, with some--specifically \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\"--having minor modifications, i.e. a little electric guitar mixed with the booming orchestra, that enhance the music's quality (though Phantom purists probably wouldn't approve). As mentioned above, the lead roles perform beautifully, but one should be prepared for some disappointment in Butler's vocals.  As the Phantom is supposed to have a powerful and dominant quality to his singing, intended to lure Christine with his voice, one would expect Butler to be the strongest character in the movie.  Sadly, this is not the case.  Though he performs adequately, he is the Phantom and \\"adequate\\" is not good enough for that role.  One could argue that Butler was the weakest of the characters, though I would add that that should not take away too much from his overall performance (he certainly isn't overtly detrimental to the musical). <br /> <br />In sum, an excellent movie that everyone, especially fans of musicals and the opera itself, should pick up.  When you do, just be sure to take the time to appreciate how integrated modern movie elements are with the original stage elements.
B000G759FS|5.0|Oh my, oh my.  This album is so good that 5 starts doesn't do it justice. <br />It has variety, it rocks, it grooves, it simmers so fantastically that you <br />are reminded why you love jazz so much in the first place.  My favorite <br />song is the title cut \\"Feeling Good\\", as it charges along with the great <br />enthusiasm of true musical artists who love what they do.  Ballads are <br />handled gracefully the trio enhanced with a tasteful touch of strings. <br />Randy Crawford offers her best performances ever, absolutely amazing in <br />phrasing, emotion, and dynamics.  Joe Sample's distinctive and characteristic groove based soloing style is in top form, the keys seem <br />to talk right to you, and he complements Randy's singing by always supporting her soulful voice without overpowering it.  <br />  This is Joe Samples best work since \\"Old Places, Old Faces\\" <br />surpassing his work on \\"The Pecan Tree\\", \\"Soul Shadows\\", and <br />\\"The Song Lives On\\".  This collection is a work of art, and EVERY song  <br />is a gem! Make this CD a part of your essential jazz collection!
0393317552|4.0|The chapters in this book are bundled full of facts.  Swathed with interesting cultural and historical data which we rarely read about, it delivers a conclusory argument as to why certain societies are more advanced than others.<br /><br />Some of the critics say it is faulty.  But, the true answer to the question he answers is anyone's to guess. This book has a conclusion which the 400+ pages well analyze.  It is a logical argument which rationally reaches valid conclusions.  And, more importantly, it is not necessarily what we were previously taught.<br /><br />I read this book bit by bit -- as though I was attending the lecture series over a period of many months.  I would pick up where the book mark left me -- after weeks of reading fiction novels -- and read more about this extremely interesting concept of sociology.<br /><br />I am not a big fan of nonfiction, but I liked this book very much.  His writng is clear. The step-by-step analysis, enhanced by sprinkles of interesting facts and historical stories, was enlightening.<br /><br />This author did something few authors in his genre can do -- he makes a very seemingly dry subject interesting.  The readers pass through this book like a well written novel.  That is a great skill. That is why this book was a best seller for such a long period of time. And, that is why I  -- a fiction reader -- will read \\"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed.\\"
B000GCFO0I|4.0|Well, I loved the game series, so I had to watch the movie (duh), but was disappointed in the short supply of creepy crawly monsters that filled the game series.  Why do the movie folks have to put their own spin on things and destroy a good, plotless splatterfest? <br /> <br />I do admit the movie was well made, the acting was good, and the special effects were cool. <br /> <br />Aside from that, if they put shovelhead from 2 in the storyline of 1, why didn't they also put the weird, neglige-wearing manequins from hell, too?  Or at least have more of shovel-head-guy. <br /> <br />I really like the transfer from twisted world into hellworld.  Nice. <br /> <br />I just keep re-harping on the lack of monsters. <br /> <br />It was a game you bash everything to death with a steel pipe, until you build up enough weaponry to battle the big boss-monsters at the end of the level, but I guess the playwriter needed to get a cozy feeling by trying to make a follow-able storyline. <br /> <br />Overall, I liked it, but hope they have more of what the game offers in the sequel.
0060776757|5.0|This original post was in regards to Amazon's policy for this book and shipping: even if you have paid money for a prime membership, you still had to pay around $9 if you wanted the same 2-day shipping.  By going to a competitor's site, shipping was free.  Apparently, no one cared and I made them mad.  I apologize.    I have subsequently received the book and read much of it.  It is absolutely wonderful and I still wouldn't change the 5-star rating I gave it.  There are new pictures I've never seen before.  The whole book consists of actual quotes from the band and very closely related folks, with no comments or interpretation from others.    I very highly recommend this book.
158799190X|5.0|My professional work involves evaluating money managers and trying to \\"understand\\" a manager's skill vs luck and where the manager might fit in an overall portfolio.  So I have spent 30+ years slashing my way through the jungle made by academics who think they can put markets and reality into nice, predictable models; and worse, listening to the sales pitches of money managers and other financial salesmen who want you to believe they are predictably worth paying very high fees and subjecting your money to untold risks. <br /> <br />It is fabulously refreshing that Taleb has razed a small piece of that jungle and raised those important questions that few in the academic, financial, or political establishment dare.  If he comes across as insufferably arrogant, so what!  Some of the negative reviews herein are a bit feeble - if you want to learn something about this very rich topic, do you really want your freshman economics professor spoon-feeding you strained pablum to make you feel comfortable your first time away from home?  Buck up!  <br /> <br />This books gives the reader plenty of amunition to take on the many people who are maliciously or inadvertently fooling you - stock brokers making more commissions than your investment returns; politicians pounding the table that their Social Security plan will have in 30 years, $1.00 more than their opponent's; or whatever your position on the war in Iraq, you have to admit that there was no planning for random outcomes.  The public is just too uncomfortable with the truth about how random the world can be.   <br /> <br />And if you don't want to read this book like a textbook on randomness or to make your own polemical points in the world, read it for the philosophical, hysterical and entertaining romp through reality that it is.  Taleb has obviously traveled and lived around the world; the fact that he has personally and professionally experienced a lot of complexity and randomness and is sharing it in this book, is quite fun.   <br /> <br />Finally, I know some very smart and rather daring financial advisors who have given this book to their clients as mandatory reading - kind of like giving or getting Galileo's book on the solar system as a Christmas gift in 1632.
0618680004|5.0|My believe system includes many things spiritual and non-scientific that would put me and Richard Dawkins at theological opposite ends but rather than being an opponent to his book or ideas, I whole-heartly applaude this work as a welcome breath of fresh air. <br /> <br />I pray that I am given patience and understanding for my Christian and Islamic neighbors but this primitive religious nonsense is getting out of hand in a most extreme manner. How long must we continue to kill and die for a God who would much rather not have us kill or die for him/her? <br /> <br />Could this be the wake up call we've needed for so many years?
B000IJ79WU|5.0|After years of waiting it's finally here. The real \\"Superman II\\". This cut is the true companion to \\"Superman:The Movie\\", same tone and quality. It is a drastically different version, more mature, intelligent, and emtionally involving. I loved the new beginning and ending, the removal of the silly slapstick, and darkening of the 3 villans. The scene taken from screen tests works better than expected. Replacing Susannah York with Marlon Brando, as originally intended, adds so much depth to the film. The hair's stood up on the back of my neck during Reeve and Brando's final scene together. Kidder, playing Lois Lane, is smarter, prettier, and more touching(in an emotional farewell to the man of steel at the film's conclusion) under Donner's direction. Geoffrey Unsworth's supreme cinematography in the restored scenes, elevates the quality of the picture and appearance of the stars back to what it was in the first film. This version has a snappier pace, which I liked better. <br />  Of course the film's not perfect. It might have been had Donner been allowed to finish in '79. This new cut finally rights a terrible wrong as best as Warner Bros., on a budget, will allow. There are minor technical gripes, but no real complaints because it's amazing that, although incomplete, with some tricky editing and polish, it works. When I was a kid, I liked \\"Superman II\\" the best, but as I got older it seemed more and more silly, juvenile, cheap, and stupid in comparison with \\"Superman:The Movie\\"(as did III, IV and Returns). Then I heard about how horrendous the producer's were to Richard Donner, firing him after he'd completed 70% of the second film and with the first film becoming a critical and commercial super success. I figured well at least there's \\"Superman:The Movie\\" and forgot about the sequels. Now, with The Richard Donner Cut, we have the true \\"Superman II\\". Watching this was like being a kid again. It's exciting, compelling, a real revelation. It shows that Donner seems to be the only director with a firm grasp on how to handle the man of steel. I wish he would take over the franchise again, he's sorely missed. <br /> The picture is great, crisp and clear, and the new sound mix in 5.1 is really well done. The deleted scenes were fun to watch, very nostalgic. The documentary \\"Restoring The Vision\\" was interesting as was the commentary, although Donner and Mankiewicz tend to repeat some of their anecdotes from the \\"Superman\\"The Movie\\" dvd, but still fun. In closing, if you really like Lester's cut of \\"II\\" or are under the age of 13, you probably won't like this. If you prefer \\"Superman:The Movie\\" over all of them, then you probably will like this. So I give 4 stars for the film itself with an extra star for the time, dollars, and effort put into this project by years of fan petitions, Warner Bros. eventual financial backing, and Michael Thau's serviceable completion and restoration of this long overdue film.
B0000524CY|5.0|Okay, there's ONE movie made that scared me so bad when I was a kid, that I couldn't sleep.  this is it, and I didn't even see the re-released version that they added all the \\"too much\\" stuff back in until years later.  Being raised Catholic, hell and the devil are the worst things you can face and already haunt your dreams.  This movie embodied everything that was drilled into you during Sunday sermons, so when I saw this film....Ho-leeee-crap! Every night I waited for my bed to start shaking because I wasn't supposed to watch it, and saw it at the midnight movies with older siblings. <br /> <br />Of course, I watched it again in my teens and it didn't seem so scary, but was still very unsettling. <br /> <br />Then, I saw the re-release a few years back, where they put everything they had to leave out back in and almost soiled my underoos all over again when <br /> <br /> <br />***Spolier, don't read this part if you haven't seen the film*** <br /> <br /> <br />She creepy-crawled downstairs all twist-turny backwards with the blood pouring out of her mouth.  Wow, was that creepy!!! <br /> <br />Still at the top of my list for scariest movie of all time.  <br />
0060776757|5.0|This book is a mind-blower for even the most fervent U2 fan. Read all the other books on the group? Well, this one adds to everything you already know about them, plus takes it to all-new levels and truly lets the fan inside U2's circle. The text is all written by the bandmembers themselves (and Mr. McGuinness, of course), and what comes through is an epic story of 4 humble, generous, talented -- and very different -- individuals who came together and jelled into a searching, spiritual (and occasionally stumbling) supergroup that has found a way to soar. The best aspect of the self-narrative by Bono, Edge, Larry, and Adam is the great depth of feeling and respect for each other that comes through -- whether it's Adam and Larry discussing the bond they have on stage, or Edge expressing protectiveness of Bono in the face of myths that have grown up around him and how they make him (Bono) vulnerable. On top of all this is the incredible wealth of photos that span U2's great career. There's just tons of great stuff here. I loved the books on U2 by Flanagan, Corbin, Stockman, et al, but this one is far and away the best. It's like really, TRULY meeting the band for the first time. Wow.....wow.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I missed the series when it was on television, but caught the movie 'Serenity' shortly after it came out on DVD. It was an incredible movie, I was impressed by the storyline, the acting and the wit. Then my husband introduced me to the series \\"Firefly\\", and it was love and first viewing of Ep. 1. Incredible series, well-written and well-acted. Witty, clever and enough edge (without being overdone) to keep you wanting more. It's a terrible shame the series was cancelled, I loved it.

0738702994|5.0|I haven't gotten a new Tarot deck in years, and now I have a new favorite.  Years ago I began working with Anna Marie Ferguson's Arthurian Tarot which has been a favorite of mine, and I must say she has definitely topped herself with her latest project, The Llewellyn Tarot!<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the classy way Llewellyn packaged their new signature deck.  I love their new box style, as you don't have to destroy the box to get everything out, and you can store everything in there if you want and keep it on a bookshelf.  The little inner box for storage is lovely featuring yet more of Anna Marie's decorative art, and the organdy bag is pretty fancy with sparkling beads dripping off the bottom.  I appreciate her creation of a beautiful back design for this deck featuring the Welsh red dragon as there is nothing worse than a beautiful deck with a boring, or worse yet, unattractive back design.  Her warm and inviting back design enhances the overall effect very well.<br /><br />This deck is stunning on so many levels.  First of all she has clearly researched her subject matter intently, and the connections that she has made between the old Welsh tales and the Major archana are sound.  Her portrayal of the Gods and Goddesses are truly inspired and in the scope of her work she seems to be deeply in touch with another plane.  It is interesting the way her techniques differ a bit from the major to minor archana, the high amount of detail in the major archana denotes the importance of the card in the reading.  Her use of color and light are amazing, and her figures are beautiful and wonderfully expressive.  She manages to keep her images rooted to the classic Tarot but with a fresh interpretations that often makes the cards even more accessible.  For example, I was intrigued by the angle that she chose for the Magician card, the viewer is looking up a slight incline towards the figure at his altar, giving him a very larger than life air, you feel as if you are an audience to this highly charasmatic figure.  I sincerely hope that she offers prints of these pieces.<br /><br />The book is very well written, as I would have expected by Anna Marie's previous efforts, her text is a treasure trove of the legends and mysteries of Wales.  Her definitions of the cards are clear and easy to understand, and give enough variety to be intuitive as well.  The stories behind each card offer insight into the meanings of the cards and they are also a great reference to the legends of the Gods of Wales.  I often used the book accompanying the Arthur deck as a quick reference anytime I was looking up something about Arthurian legend, and I can see myself using this book in the same way.  So far the readings I have done with it really hit the mark, it is very intuitive to read and speaks quite well.  I would highly recommend The Llewellyn Tarot skillfully crafted by Anna Marie Ferguson.<br /><br />Mickie Mueller,<br /><br />Illustrator of The Well Worn Path deckf you are an audience to this highly charasmatic figure.

B000FQJAIW|3.0|(This is for SW and ESB combined) <br /> <br />5 - Original Versions <br />1 - Picture quality <br /> <br />I can just imagine Mr. Lucas wringing his hands saying, \\"How dare they not like my 'special editions'! So, they'd prefer the original releases? Well, I'll give them the original releases! Complete without any digital enhancement of picture quality whatsoever! Ha ha ha ha!\\" <br /> <br />They have to have the worst picture quality of any DVD I own. Shame on you George! Still, Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back are still better with the poor quality picture than with the altered scenes. <br />I didn't mind the scenes that are improved, such as redoing the special effects for the ships without really changing what happened. What I find unbearable to watch are scenes that change the action are not even as well done as the original. <br /> <br />1. Greedo scene. The new version robs Han of his cleverness as well as his edge, and reduces it to nothin more than luck (and altered poorly to boot. Incredibly fake looking encounter in \\"special\\" edition). <br />2. Wampa (ESB). Seeing the creature more vividly robs the scene of suspense and fear. (Not too mention the terrible altered sound effects) <br />3. Vader speaks with the Emperor (ESB). The movie begins with Vader obsessed with finding \\"Skywalker\\", but then needs the Emperor to tell him that Luke's his son? Please don't alter scene to try to fit the infereor prequal trilogy.

Essential for any and all true Zep fans.
B000GIXEIG|5.0|\\"Beowulf and Grendel\\" is a terrific movie, taken by itself without judging it against the Old English poem. I am an English graduate student with a special interest in Old English, so I am quite familar with the epic. There are many points where the movie deviates from its source material (the inclusion of the character Selma, the omission of the final battle with the dragon, et cetera). Beyond these concrete differences, there are some less obvious, and deeper differences. This movie has an agenda, and is uncomfortable with the simple good and simple evil presented in the poem. Grendel is given justification, and he is presented as a humane (and almost human) character, who is just as deserving of our pity as Gollum is in the Lord of the Rings.     Beowulf begins to question the motives of Hrothgar, and becomes somewhat disillusioned with the hero myths that begin to surround him. In short, this movie is Beowulf for the modern era, as we expect complex characters with varying degrees of motivation and ambiguity. Enjoy this movie for what it is, and not for what it lacks. If anything, this film may make viewers want to read the epic poem, and that can only be a good thing.    As a side note, this movie actually contains *quite* a bit of profanity. I am unsure why this is added; it may be to eliminate some of the distance between modern viewers and the early medieval period, or it may simply be an attempt to convey the rugged and harsh conditions of the period.
B000FVBLEI|5.0|All That Remains have made an incredible CD with The Fall of Ideals.

B000GFLAI0|5.0|If you are even a \\"moderate\\" Zimmy fan, you gotta get this!  I've been listening to it every day since I picked it up two weeks ago, sometimes twice, back to back.  Funny thing is, I knew (KNEW!) I would like it and shorenuff, from the opening bars of Thunder On The Mountain I was hooked.  That opener reminds me a lot of Dylan's work with Knopfler on Slow Train, but it immediately kicks off with the grind of Everything's Broken and Things Have Changed, two \\"newer\\" singles that have gassed the poet laureate of rock and roll through the last 10 years.<br /><br />Since this album has already been reviewed over a hundred times, lets get down to meat of why I wanted to add my two cents here.<br /><br />Anyone old enough (or retro enough) to be familiar with Dylan's Desire album ('76) will find themselves on some similar ground here at the end of the album.  The epic edda finale \\"Ain't Walkin\\" carries with it the sense of being a sequel to the ending of Desire.  The finale on that album is One More Cup Of Coffee, a song that could be placed immediately in front of this one to rather \\"complete\\" a mythic tale.  On the same Desire album you will find my personal favorite Dylan tune \\"Isis\\", another mythos ballad that captures a surreal state between classic western (film), fantasy fable (literature), and greco-egyptian mythology (legend).  Isis is one of Bob's more enigmatic songs, beautiful, haunting, humorous, and even a touch of science-fiction a-la Stargate.  It has garnered many fans, though it seems to elude the endless barrage of compilation albums.  Ain't Walkin' takes the mythos one step further.  Before the tragic hero of One More Cup Of Coffee (before I go) sets out on his quest, we are saturated with a haunting violin accompaniment, bohemian-style-hungarian-folk with hair-raising harmony vocals by Emmylou Harris.  Although we never quite get the sense of what lies before the heroic journey, we are certain enough that it is death.  Now, 30 years later, Dylan completes the tale, with the same haunting string arrangements, the same dark-mythos metre, and a begrudglingly jaded look back at the journey, from the vantage-point of that final death.  It is both a spiritual and anti-spiritual climax, riddled with peculiar idioms and imagery.  For instance, the reference to the \\"toothache in my heel\\" is rather symptomatic of a jewish born turned born again christian turned nondenomenational spiritualist.  The serpent (christian or muslim) is set to nip at the faithful hebrews heels \\"for all your days\\".  In my opinion, these three songs (Isis, One More Cup of Coffee, and Ain't Walkin') are all cut from the same cloth and are my three favorite offerings from Dr. Robert.  If you purchase this album and truly enjoy it, be not afraid to pick up Desire, you'll be glad you did!<br /><br />Also, Levee's Gonna Break sends up some of Bob's Best Blues since \\"When You Gonna Wake Up?\\" (Slow Train '79), and most all of Time Out Of Mind nearly ten years ago.<br /><br />Lastly, as enough of the reviewers here have already said, what's up with Alicia Keys???mpletes the tale, with the same haunting string arrangements, the same dark-mythos metre, and a begrudglingly jaded look back at the journey, from the vantage-point of that final death.

0670034711|1.0|Just another self indulgent autobiography.  It was too boring to read and had not much to say.  If you are in for light reading, go for it.  Do not expect too much from this one or you might be very disappointed.
B00006CXGM|2.0|I had (notice the past tense) a girlfriend who loved this movie and brought it over one night for us to watch. The way she described it made me really want to see it. Unfortunately, her sales skills far surpassed anything the movie had to offer. I was under the impression that this was a comedy - and I really enjoy comedies - but the comedic moments were few and very far between.  <br /> <br />Part of the fault for the sad overall outcome of this movie must lie with the editor. The movie could have flowed far better, been easier to follow, and been funnier with proper editing.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Of course, I\\"m a big Dylan fan, for a long,long time.  Although he's had, in the past a few so/so albums with  maybe a  great   track or two...this does not fit into that category.  It does fit into that \\"trilogy\\" cliche with the previous two, but after a month, I\\"ve decided it surpasses ,or at least , rivals \\"Time\\" and \\"Love\\".. any way, without any more patronizing..the album is EXCELLENT!!! (the only CD as of late worth playing in its entirty all too often (Lord have pity on yourselves)
B0002KVUKW|2.0|The idea of throwing all the 19th Century \\"monsters\\" (Mr. Hyde, Dracula, Frankenstein's monster and werewolves) into one flick was done to better affect in the goofball Abbott & Costello movies.  Making Van Helsing a renowned monster hunter backed by the Church and a team of brilliant gadget makers is corny.  If you want to get to know Van Helsing, read Bram Stoker's Dracula.<br /><br />Van Helsing has beautiful women and great special effects.  The action is attention-grabbing at times. But neither are enough to make this a good film.  There are some fun bits but the movie's definitely not worth the purchase price and maybe not even worth the rental price.
0307346609|3.0|First of all, if the reader is a gorehound, this isn't the book for you. There are no gruesome descriptions of Zombies killing people, or of people killing zombies. This isn't really a novel in the classic sense where one follows certain characters from the beginning to the end; it's more a series of snapshots of what happened during this zombie crisis. As a zombie novel, it's better (way better) than Monster Island, which was a mish-mosh of ideas, with an ending ripped off from Dead Alive (Peter Jackons zombie opus) but it's isn't quite as good as Phillip Nutman's Wetwork. The author takes on a lot, but he makes a few mistakes, one of them being that the zombies in this eat everything. I found that unbelieavable. A piece like that gives me little or no hope that humanity would survive. Another bit I found silly was the Ghouls walking around under water, ala Fulci's Zombie. Zombies rot, so you know, the fish should be ripping them apart, having a meal. I also would have liked to know; how did the zombie plauge start and was it over at the end of the book, or close to being cured? I got left hanging a little too much. The main failing is that there are no characters to connect with, no one to really care about while one reads the book. There are a lot of good ideas, but overall this isn't a book that will find a permanent place on my bookshelf. It's more a read of curiosity than something I'd go back to. Still, with Brooks connections, I wonder when this will be optioned as a movie...
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|V is a skillful blending of the revenge picture (\\"They tortured him and left him for dead...now he's back and he'll make 'em pay!\\") and the bleak future world picture (\\"In the near future we will all have numbers. The government will tell us what to think.  But a rag-tag group of renegades will risk everything...to save mankind.\\")<br /><br />That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie!  Very polished.  Great soundtrack.  But for people to say its thought provoking, suggesting it had not occurred to them that right wing politicians are ruining the quality of our lives, well, duh.<br /><br />To be honest I thought there were some sincere aspirations until the end.  But once the point was made, and the masses were on the march there really was no need to blow anything else up.  But come on, this is pure entertainment disguised as something very serious.  Just enjoy--oh, and by the way, your National Identity card is in the mail.
B000HEWEE4|3.0|Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves are good friends so it's understandable they wanted to act together again. In the Lake House they have more chemistry than ever, but surely they could have found better material than this as their vehicle. The Lake Houses is so full of plot holes, so full of cheesy dialogue, and the characters are so underwritten and insipid that the film ends up a weird, flaggingly paced caricature of itself.     You really have to suspend disbelief as Alex an architect (Keanu Reeves) and Kate a doctor (Sandra Bullock) actually meet. Both live in a contemporary glass walled house on the picaresque shore of Lake Michigan - he in 2004 and she in 2006 when they begin exchanging correspondence via the house's mailbox. The fact that their letters are traveling through time doesn't seem to bother them.     Eventually, they realize that they're meant to be together, but alas what are they to do? They're both stranded in their respective time periods. Alex attempts to seek out Kate's 2004 counterpart when she's tied to a dutiful beau (Dylan Walsh). Mostly, however their liaison relies on split-screen wizardry and fluent editing (by Alejandro Brodersohn and Lynzee Klingman). For her part, Kate waits patiently for Alex to \\"catch up\\" to her.     Admittedly, The Lake House is beautiful to look at and Sandra and Keanu are absolutely lovely, the spark that ignited between them in Speed still burns, but there's not much edge to their relationship - it's all rather sweet and adorable rather than sexy or passionate. But the major problem with The Lake House is that there's a plot turn in the first act that most savvy viewers will see coming that ruins any suspense for the rest of the story.     As Alex and Kate Bullock and Reeves phone in carefully muted performances, in fact they're so subdued that they seem to drift through the story in a daze, as if they don't really care what happens. Even their few scenes together are extremely soft, slow and shamelessly sentimental. Despite the fluid cinematography, editing and music, these short scenes prevent the film from flowing.     There's also several nagging plot points - including a superfluous subplot involving Alex's dying father (Christopher Plummer) - that make it almost impossible to suspend disbelief. And how can the lake house supposedly built with pillars and glass have an enclosed attic?  Never mind; trying to find logic in this film will drive you crazy along with a script that jumps around in time so much that you're never quite sure when you're in 2004 or 2006.     On the plus side, Agresti's direction is lyrical and textured; giving the film a warm rhythm that just about makes up for its lack of pacing. The movie also highlights the urban beauty of Chicago, making the best of the city's surrounds. And I guess it's nice, after all this time, to see Reeves and Bullock together again, and even though they ground The Lake House and allowing us to overlook many of its contrivances, I'm still not sure why they chose this kind of movie to star in. Mike Leonard September 06.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|This unique mixture of contemporary teen-angst and classic noir sensibility is priceless and wonderful.  All the young actors  rise to the occasion beautifully - they are world-weary, weathered, and malevolently confident in a middle-aged streetwise way -  yet they hang out at their high school and occasionally refer to \\"my mom\\"....and it all works beautifully and with occasional well-place humor.  The dame, the gumshoe, the thug, the kingpin - they're all there and entirely compelling.   It's a surreal and haunting work of art:  the lighting, the faces, the music, editing, the Hammett-esque dialog.   Why didn't this thing get a lot more recognition??  Hats off to the director and whole team.  Renews my believe in film as Art. See it once, see it twice.
B000063UR1|3.0|This is such a bizarre movie.  I find it alternatively touching, poignant, annoying and ridiculously funny depending on how I look at it.  First of all, the plot has so many holes you could drive a tank through them.  Let's see, somehow all the forests on Earth were destroyed and a decision was made to save them by planting huge tracts of forests in gigantic geodesic domes mounted on spacecraft out around Saturn.  Eight years later they decide to destroy all the domes with nuclear bombs and bring the ships back to Earth.  Forget about the insane amount of money and effort it would take to set this up in the first place, forget about leaving the forests in their domes under the care of drones, let's blow them up.  The whole plot makes no sense. <br /> <br />But it's as an un-intentional parody of an environmental fanatic that Bruce Dern, as Freeman Lowell, really shines in this movie.  Start out with the sacharine sweet scene of 'ol martyr Lowell in white robes hoeing his garden and feeding Mr. Friendly rabbit to the strains of a Joan Baez tune to open the movie and you know all you need to know about where this flick is going.  Gee, does it have a message? <br /> <br />And I dare anyone not to laugh after watching sanctimoniuos Lowell arguing with his shipmates, then stalking off to one of the domes in a huff in his white robe and, get this, when he gets there, he raises his hand and an eagle lands on it.  I horked soda out of my nose on that scene, it was so unbelievably funny. <br /> <br />Yet somehow Bruce as Lowell also portrays the selfish environmental movement perfectly.  Lowell kills his shipmates to save the trees.  Rich Western environmentalists discover that DDT if used indiscriminately is bad for birds and ban it in all it's uses, thus consigning millions upon millions of poor Africans and Asians to horrible death by malaria over the next 40 years.  Millions of dead people, but at least rich environmentalists can go on eco-tours and see all the pretty plumage on the parrots.  Yeah, there's a message there. <br /> <br />And when good 'ol Lowell flees and can't figure out why his forest is dying, it's almost too good to be true.  Showing the bone-headedness of a truly committed environmentalist, he can't figure out that running away from the sun means less light, and less light means dead plants. <br /> <br />To it's credit, there are some cool things about this movie.  The set, the special effects (in 1971 no less) and the drones are totally cool.  If you can forget the heavy-handed \\"message\\", the middle of the movie is pretty good, especially Lowell's reprogramming of the drones to save his sanity and the ship after running through Saturn's rings. <br /> <br />And it ends well, sort of.  Lowell blows himself up, martyr to the end, rather than going back to Earth, and the last geodesic dome slides off into space with it's forest under the care of one of the drones.  So at least somewhere out there, Mr, Friendly Rabbit still eats Lowell's crops to the strains of sanctimonious Joan Baez tunes.
0440219078|3.0|I thought \\"The Giver\\" by Lois Lowry was an okay book.  The storyline and plot of the book was entertaining.  It was creative, and I did like it.  I found the actually story to be hard to get into though, but that was mostly because of the writing style.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the fantasy or futuristic type stories.  The ideas in the plot were original, but sometimes it got a little confusing what the characters were talking about or meant - especially in the beginning of the book.  I felt that the wording the author used made parts of the story a little boring, but other parts kept you interested in reading more.  I would rate The Giver three stars because the story itself was good, it just needed to be written with a little bit different words, so that the story flowed more.
0780020685|5.0|It is, in a word, fabulous.  In more words:<br /><br />I loved the man who played Kambei Shimada: Takashi Shimura.  This film was made in 1954 and here was an actor who looked like he could star in a movie of today.  He was wonderfully believable and natural -- even though I was reading subtitles the whole time.  I understand from reading Roger Ebert's review of \\"Seven Samurai\\" that he considers Akira Kurosawa's finest movie to have been \\"Ikiru\\" which also starred Shimura.  After the strength of his role in SS, I am eager to see \\"Ikiru\\".<br /><br />Of course, Toshiro Mifune was terrific as Kikuchiyo, the deranged farmer-turned-samurai.  I learned a bit about him that I had been curious about.  I saw him in the role of Admiral Yamamoto in \\"Midway\\" (which I saw in Los Angeles in a theatre that went whole hog with the \\"Sensurround\\" sound system.  Man!  Those planes starting up at the beginning of the film!  It was like an earthquake!).  His voice was overdubbed by American Paul Frees, whose voice was instantly familiar to me as the voice of Boris Badenov from the Rocky and Bullwinkle show, and as one of the voice talents in Stan Freberg's troupe (he narrated \\"Stan Freberg Presents the United States of America, Vol. 1).  The trivia I learned was that even though Mifune painstakingly learned how to sound out English phonetically, his own voice was never heard in English-speaking roles, something he regretted to his dying day.<br /><br />Mifune plays the character of Kikuchiyo with wonderful verve and physicality.  His mood swings are a feature of the film as Kambei Shimada marshals the farmers to defend their own village from the coming bandit attack.  After a very skilled samurai stages a selfless raid on the bandit camp to capture one of their few firearms (this is set in the 1600s) Kikuchiyo is bothered by the gushing hero worship shown by the band's \\"apprentice\\" samurai.  Kikuchiyo runs off and very cleverly captures a second firearm, but brings down the whole gang of bandits who manage to kill one of the band of seven.  Kikuchiyo's remorse and what he does to redeem himself is a highlight of the movie, I think.<br /><br />\\"Seven Samurai\\" is the story of down-on-their-luck samurai warriors coming to the aid of a poor village of farmers just for the chance at regular meals.  The movie spotlights the suspicions some of the farmers have for samurai--specifically the fear that their daughters will be carried off. There's the budding romance between the apprentice samurai and the daughter of the farmer who most fears the lecherous reputation of the samurai.  He even cuts his daughter's hair to make her look like a boy before the samurai arrive; but she is discovered and the apprentice is moonstruck by her.<br /><br />There isn't ANY of the fancy choreography that comes standard with modern day martial arts movies.  The fights are mel&eacute;es, for the most part, not individual mano-a-mano duels...but I think they are more authentic for that reason.<br /><br />The slow buildup, the recruiting of the samurai to defend the village, the buildup of the defenses, the training of the villagers to stand and fight, the panicky rushing around of groups of villagers when the bandits finally do arrive, the tactics employed to whittle away at the bandits' numbers, the things the samurai do to pluck up the courage and morale of the villagers...all these factors are beautifully timed and executed.<br /><br />It was amazing to me to feel so strongly about a movie that required me to read all of the dialog, but I have few objections to it now that I've seen such excellent movies as \\"Amelie\\", \\"Hero\\", and \\"Seven Samurai\\".  I suppose there's an added dimension of concentration that has to be invested in a subtitled movie, but that simply makes the experience more complete, I think.

0393324818|5.0|If you are a fan, this is a great read.  If you are not a fan, but just interested in the game, it is still a great read.  What I find most amusing are the baseball \\"experts\\" who poo-poo Billy Bean's approach to fielding and running a baseball team.  \\"The proof of the pudding is in the eatin'\\" and the cognocenti appear to dislike the taste.  The Oakland A's have been one of the stellar teams, yet, it appears that success is not what is important.  What is important is success based on the recipe that the \\"experts\\" write.

1400079179|4.0|So here's the deal... I pride myself on being a reader.  I love the classics.  Thus, I made sure as hell to avoid the Da Vinci Code.  Everybody and their mother said that this was a fantastic book, and that I should read it right away. The rule of thumb is that whatever the mass of people recommend will without a doubt be stupid, and predictable (see Friends, Fox Reality).<br /><br />After a while, I gave into the pressure.  And here's the deal.  This book is not literature.  It's a fun page turner.  I enjoyed the book a lot, but I'm not going to claim it to be \\"a wonderful piece of literature.\\"  Anyone who claims that it is, probably doesn't read a whole lot, or if they do, nothing challenging.<br /><br />The truth is, if you understand that you shouldn't treat it as Emerson, you will enjoy this book.  I had a blast reading it, perhaps because I read it for entertainment purposes only.  If you pick up the Da Vinci Code with the same intention, it'll be worth every penny.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|This album will transport many listeners into a time of simple compelling American music.
B000FIMG68|4.0|First off i'm going to have to completely disagree with the 2 spotlight reviews and say this was better than the 1st season, for me the 1st season moved far too slowly, but the introduction of new survivors and frequent meetings with the others made this series more interesting.  I have been anxiously waiting the next episodes during this season (which I wasn't during the 1st season), and I was all ready to highly recommend season 2 and give it the perfect 5 but then the ending came and it was dissapointing to say the least.  Without giving away plot details I will say that once again the ending told us nothing and threw up several more questions, and my concern with this is that they may continue doing this season after season by which time some may have lost interest.<br /><br />Despite the poor ending I still highly recommend both seasons of Lost and urge you to stick with the series even when certain episodes hit a bit of a lull, which sadly happens too often.  I also cannot agree with those calling it the best thing on TV, I find 24 a far more interesting and exciting program, which never loses steam or gets dull.  Nevertheless I am intrigued by the series and I like many others will continue watching this through to the end, even though that is likely to be several years down the line, I hope the writers continue to make it worth my while.
B000002UD7|3.0|When one looks at the history of musical acts that can be categorized as \\"Dance Music\\" or \\"Disco\\", there are few acts that have achieved the success and longevity of the Pet Shop Boys.   The Pet Shop Boys have been making music for over 20 years - releasing an album usually about every one or two years.   In the UK, the Pet Shop Boys have consistently produced Top 10 albums.   They haven't had quite the same amount of success on American shores, but nonetheless they have still maintained a solid following.    It actually didn't start out like that for the Pet Shop Boys in the U.S.    They actually burst on to the music scene in 1986 with a #1 song entitled \\"West End Girls\\".    They would then follow \\"West End Girls\\" up with another hit - \\"Opportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money)\\".     These two songs would be part of the debut - and most successful album by the Pet Shop Boys \\"Please\\".   With a successful album such as \\"Please\\" under their belt, the Pet Shop Boys were poised to show the public what they could do on their follow-up album.   That second effort - \\"Actually\\" would continue to garner the Pet Shop Boys commercial success, but overall does not stand up to \\"Please\\". <br /> <br />I think there are three reasons why \\"Actually\\" falls short - especially when compared to \\"Please\\" <br /> <br />1) The album would be released about 18 months following \\"Please\\".   Although a song like \\"It's a Sin\\" was recording during the \\"Please\\" sessions, the Pet Shop Boys had little time to put together a new album given the whirlwind of success they had with \\"Please\\". <br />2) \\"Please\\" was basically produced in its entirety by Stephen Hague.   For \\"Actually\\", multiple producers (including Hague for \\"What Have I Done to Deserve This?\\", \\"It's a Sin\\" and \\"Kings Cross\\") were used on this album.   As a result, \\"Actually\\" lacks a lot of the continuity of its predecessor. <br />3) Many of the songs didn't have me doing handstands like the first album. <br /> <br />Although \\"Actually\\" does fall short compared to \\"Please\\", there are also some good points.   The good news is that the Pet Shop Boys still aren't afraid to improvise and \\"think out of the box\\".    They also prove they can do some softer songs (although their strength is with high tempo electronic sound)  Here is a song by song synopsis: <br /> <br />\\"One More Chance\\": This song grows on you.   I like the sound effects like the car screeching.  This is definitely one of those songs where the Pet Shop Boys think out of the box.  Neil Tennant's vocals are right on the money here, but it is his spoken words that will shine. <br /> <br />\\"What Have I Done to Deserve This?\\": This song has very much a pop feel and was a commercial success.  Once again Tennant shines on vocals.   This song features a guest vocal performance by Dusty Springfield.  However Springfield's vocals do little to impress me on this track. <br /> <br />\\"Shopping\\": Definitely the weakest track on the collection (and possibly by the Pet Shop Boys).  The song does little to impress me.  While the verse lyrics are clever, the chorus lyrics were unimpressive (S-H-O-P-P-I-N-G).  The melody also seemed to be hastily put together. <br /> <br />\\"Rent\\": This song has a softer edge.   This song deals with a person who is supported financially by his lover.   Not a bad song, but Tennant's higher octave vocals here weren't as impressive as I've seen in other songs. <br /> <br />\\"Hit Music\\": This is one of the strongest songs by the Pet Shop Boys - and I'm surprised this never was a hit single.  This song offers the \\"high tempo electronic sound\\" that made the Pet Shop Boys famous.   Tennant's vocals are right on the money here.  It is a very catchy song.   If you listen you can hear that the melody resembles a slight sample of the \\"Peter Gunn Theme\\". <br /> <br />\\"It Couldn't Happen Here\\":  This song has a haunting quality to it - and that will be the highlight to this song.   It's one of the better softer tempo songs by the Pet Shop Boys, but still not as good as the high tempo material. <br /> <br />\\"It's a Sin\\":  This was another hit single.  The electronic orchestral quality of this song is really going to be the highlight - especially the intro.  Once again the \\"high tempo\\" sound is in play here.  Tennant pulls off the vocals flawlessly again. One thing I didn't like was the \\"prayer\\" midway through the song. <br /> <br />\\"I Want to Wake Up\\":  This is one of the underrated tracks on this album.   This wasn't a bad song.  I particularly liked the melody here.  Listen to how well Tennant transitions the spoken words starting from \\"It's mad to be in love with someone else\\" into sung vocals - great stuff. <br /> <br />\\"Heart\\":  This song had a classic dance club feel to it.   A good song, I still wouldn't categorize this in the upper echelon of songs by the Pet Shop Boys. <br /> <br />\\"King's Cross\\":  Here is another example where the Pet Shop Boys prove they can do a slow song.   This song offers some socio-political commentary.  This is heard in the opening lyrics, \\"The man at the back of the queue was sent; to feel the smack of firm government\\".  This again shows an example of the Pet Shop Boys \\"thinking out of the box\\".   Good melody in this song as well. <br /> <br />While it's clear that the Pet Shop Boys did some \\"thinking out of the box\\", this album offered a mixed bag.  Perhaps this is why that this album marked the end of the Pet Shop Boys run on the U.S. charts.   I wish that the liner notes included the lyrics to each of the songs.    Despite some of the flaws, this isn't a bad album.   Pet Shop Boys will like this album a lot, but the jury will be out for the casual fan.
B000HEVALC|5.0|Stunning sound quality makes this disc a must for all Elvis fans.  This material simply never sounded better (due to new tapes they found) and in addition is complete and in the correct sequence.
B000GIXEIG|2.0|I was hoping this film would be good, but alas - twas not to be. Let's face it people, it's a pretty bad movie.<br /><br />Clumsily edited, terrible makeup (especially all the rubber Grendel body-suits), no closeups of actors (there are about 10 actors in the whole \\"epic\\" movie), and that's not even mentioning the accents, which are all over the map. Sarah Polley sounds like she's straight out of the mall, while Butler is unintelligable half the time.<br /><br />The scenery is gorgeous, but it's hard to get into the spirit of a Beowulf movie that is twice as inept as The 13th Warrior. If you are on the fence, take a pass.

Since I'm from the Netherlands, I couldn't watch it on tv, so I had to wait till it was released on dvd. I already read a lot of reviews and, judging from these reviews, thought it would be as good as season 1. However, I didn't agree to that fact. Don't get me wrong, VM is still in my top 5 shows ever, but I think season 1 was better, so season 2 only deserves 4 stars. The main problem was the bus crash story. The outline is just very confusing and not nearly as interesting as the Lilly Kane murder. I also didn't like Veronica and Duncan together, I was so happy to see her back together with Logan the last episode!! Besides these 2 points, I even thought the episode mysteries were less exciting than the ones in season 1. This all must sound very negative, but I just thought season 1 was better, and was somewhat disappointed in the second season. However, I'm still a loyal fan and can't wait for season 3!
0061015725|4.0|If you've read anything else from Chrichton, I'm sure you'll like this one. It's a classic example of his ability mix fast-paced fiction with excellent scientific possibility. I really admire Chrichton's style and sophistication and recomend this to anyone who feels the same way. I noticed though, in this book he has a tendency to get carried away with repeditive descriptions. <br /> <br />This book probably isn't his BEST work but its a damn good novel. Satisfaction garunteed.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|I scoffed at this film originally, thinking it would be a poor version of \\"Mary Poppins\\".  I was pleasantly surprised.  Instead of good, but neglected children, you have holy terrors who need to be put in their place and Nanny MacPhee is just the woman. <br /> <br />What gets me the most about this film, is the ending.  I won't give it away, but it's an amazing fairy tale ending.  The imagery and some references to earlier lines in the film were brilliantly done.  Even my husband got a little emotional at the end and that's nearly impossible to do.  Yet every time we catch it flipping past our movie channel, we watch, absolutely enthralled.
B000H5U65C|5.0|...but this sh#* is absolutely unbelievable.  Any fan of music can appreciate this album.  I don't even know what to say.  Up until about 6 months ago I had only heard of Mastodon and how good they are, but most of that came from friends who are into metal.  I, not being a big fan of metal, never gave this band a chance, but when I finally did, Mastodon did not disappoint.  I like heavy music, but most metal bands sound alike to me, with screaming vocals 99.9% of time and riffs and time changes that don't inspire me.  This album is so complex and really displays the talent these guys have.  Its like they took great elements from all the heavyweight metal bands out and put into a melting pot and made it work.  I can't put this album down, I am addicted.  I can't find one track to say anything bad about.  Buy this and all previous releases.  So far I think Leviathan is their best but I can find something I like on all of them.
B000GRUS22|4.0|I personally think that this is a great album. I have heard a few songs half a dozen times already and I like it a lot so far. Bottomline for all those people expecting another Sadeness repeat will be dissappointed, because Cretu is all about new things and not repeating what brought him fame. The lyrics are very amazing and I think compared to Voyageur, the album is a lot less vocal, which I think is good, because Cretu has always excelled with some vocals and breath taking music that goes along with it. Buy it if you are a loyal fan. It won't dissapoint. Curiously, however, the Hello & Welcome single that was supposedly out before this is not at all the same on the actual album. Tracks definitely worth checking out: Northern Lights, Invisible Love, 20,000 miles over the sea, goodbye milky way. Enjoy!
0440416027|5.0|SKELLIG is highly original and beautifully written.  The characters of Michael and Mina as well as their parents are well drawn and fully realized and I feel the book would appeal equally to girls and boys. The book is neither pure fantasy or realistic fiction but a unique and lyrically crafted blend.  Michael's school life and Mina's home schooled life are nicely contrasted and though the book is set in England and has that definite British feel it is not confusing to the American reader.   The book makes sense in the context of the fantasy character (Skellig) it creates and has a satisfying conclusion even though we never get a total understanding of who or what Skellig is though Almond gives us tantalizing hints.  Too much explanation would have taken away some of the magic and grace of the story.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|Who whould have thought that anybody could ever even come close to Sinatra - much less be his equal?  Well, Ole Blue Eyes has met his match in Michael Buble. So rarely does a talent of Buble's caliber come along...he is this generation's answer to Sinatra.  Now, if we could only entice him to record a duet(s) with Renee Olstead life would be ideal!  Michael not only has an amazing voice but he is truly the best performer I've ever seen...what a wicked combination! 'Caught in the Act' is superb and a definite must have.
B000GFLE86|2.0|I thought her earlier efforts were superb, heralding a phenomenal new singer.This one is a formulaic repeat and is heavy on standards which have been done to death by the greatest singers of all time. What can she contribute to \\"Summer Wind\\" after Sinatra? \\"River\\" -- the duet with k.d. Lang -- and her own composition are actually the standouts here. She does a phenomenal job also on Leonard Cohen songs. She should stick to those, her own compostions and Dylan. Most annoying are the orchestration and electric organ. The disk sounds like a cheap wedding.
B000GPIPSS|5.0|For 75 years it has been one of the most legendary chilling horror films of all time, the title role made Bela Lugosi made a star & other successful horror films followed making Lugosi a legend of Hollywood horror. Now the legendary film is in a new edition with bonus features on the career of Bela Lugosi, featurette on Universal Horror & the spainish version of \\"Dracula\\" Bela Lugosi is one of the greatest movie stars of all time, whom this role belongs to him, he hasn't taken it to the grave. If you like classic horror, then see Bram Stoker's master of evil brought to life by Bela Lugosi in \\"Dracula\\" get out & buy it, the children of the night are calling!
B0009S2T0M|3.0|I was afraid to watch this because it has been said over and over how ultra-violent a movie Oldboy is.  I tend to be a little squemish, and nothing here bothered me that much (but to be fair, I closed my eyes during the tooth pulling scene).  The whole octopus thing, was unpleasant but nothing here made this a horror movie.  It reminded me of a less stylized Kill Bill.<br /><br />The \\"big reveal\\" is a twist I didn't see coming, but it left a sour taste in my mouth and a few questions...<br /><br />I wanted to give it two stars, but I thought since I was still thinking about it the next day, it probably deserved three.  Can't say I would watch this again any time soon.
B000FA57RG|3.0|I will try to be as short as possible because I don't want to bore you. First of all, The documentary is a bit boring at some parts (when she talks about Kabbalah, when she talks too much, when the conversations are not about music); then, the performances are so edited that you can't enjoy them much. Why did they do that? <br /> <br />On the other hand, the \\"live\\" CD is not actually live! \\"The Beast Within\\", \\"Vogue\\", \\"Nobody Knows Me\\", \\"Hollywood\\" and \\"Die Another Day\\" were not sung live! The other tracks are OK, I think. Didn't these people think that it would've been better to put on this CD gems like \\"Material Girl\\", Burning Up\\", Nothing Fails\\", \\"Papa Don't Preach\\", Express Yourself\\" or \\"Frozen\\", which were sung live and were amazing???  <br /> <br />Once again, people at Warner disappoint us -the fans-releasing an average product. Whereas other artists release great DVDs (examples: Pet Shop Boys' Performance and Pop Art; Kylie Minogue's Show Girl and Ultimate Kylie; Depeche Mode's Touring The Angel, Culture Club's Greatest Hits, etc, etc, etc; Madonna keeps releasing DVDs that are not so good in content. When on earth will the fans get what we want? When?  <br /> <br />And what about The Re-Invention Tour Live in Lisbon DVD? And what about a good and complete video collection? And her Virgin Tour and Blonde Ambition Tour on DVD? Will they ever be released? Id' better not talk about that, I promised to keep it short.
B000002UA9|3.0|As much as it pains me to call a Beatle record average (they're my favorite band ever), that word sums up Please Please Me pretty well. Don't get me wrong, it has its moments - album-opener I Saw Her Standing There is certainly one; Ringo's showcase Boys is a blast, one of my favorite Ringo-sung tunes; the justly legendary title track; Love Me Do (the group's first #1 hit in America) and especially the high-energy cover of Twist And Shout. But there are one too many weak tracks. For one, A Taste of Honey is arguably the worst thing the Beatles ever did, not counting Revolution #9 - in the Beatles' defense, they hated it, it went as far as John singing \\"A waste of money\\" instead of the title phrase in concert. The rest is middle-of-the-road pop. It's inviting, quick, and catchy as hell, but doesn't nearly measure up to the high standards the later records set. I guess I made a mistake by listening to this after the late '60's classics. So you won't miss your $15 if you pick it up, but don't expect Abbey Road.
6305537313|5.0|The sight of Audrey Hepburn, dressed immaculately in a black dress, wearing large black goggles, holding a danish pastry in one of her hands and a coffee in the other, looking wishfully, enchantedly into the window of Tiffany, joins forces with the extremely beautiful yet melancholy background score by Henri Mancini to set the tone of the movie. Quirky, witty, modern, fashionable, yet flowing over an undercurrent of unexplainable sadness.  <br /> <br />Holly Golightly (I must say I have never seen an actress look more beautiful and apt in her role) plunges a viewer into a strange state of mind. She makes him happy and sad at the same time. Happy for obvious reasons but sad because behind her merry facade lies someone who is progressively falling into a chaos due to her own indiscretion and indecision. And you feel for that other person mainly because of the amazing talent of Hepburn at being able to convey small nuances of her character.  <br /> <br />The movie made me sad. Extremely sad, as I fell in love with Hepburn. Her vulnurability has made me a fan of her for life and I am sad that her charisma, her charm is not present anymore. Personally, I feel that such works of art and perfection like Audrey should last for ever :-).
0671015206|3.0|Nothing really groundbreaking here.  Mostly common sense.  You can visit a few websites and virtually get the same info presented in this book.
B000GG4KTU|5.0|Another unbelievable CD from the prodigious Diana Krall!!!  One of my favorites already!  The sensiivity of her vocals, diction that tells ancient stories-- puts me in a faraway place with each well constructed arrangement and phenomenal delivery.  \\"Little Girl Blue\\" is one of the saddest songs I have ever heard and Krall makes you feel this one as her voice fades into the faintest whisper, \\"Count your fingers...\\"  She swings on \\"Day and Day Out\\" and you can't help but dance and know that love is once again around the corner.  She has claimed her place as world famous jazz musician at the top of her game, the \\"new old guard\\".  She brings me joy and to my knees with this fantastic album.  A must for any 'dinner at eight', wine tasting on a roof top overlooking the city skyline, or rainy afternoon, all alone.  BRAVO!!!
B000HCO8IQ|5.0|Scissor Sisters, thankfully, didn't try to duplicate the sounds and rhythms of their debut CD. If they had, this would have been panned as being \\"more of the same\\", and fans would have complained that they wanted more original material. Well - here it is. Original material galore. As if that isn't enough, they flex their muscles and show themselves capable of different styles - even a style that flies against their trademark stamp of being a \\"fun\\" band, in particular the song \\"Might Tell You Tonight\\", and differently on \\"Intermission\\", although the latter still has you snapping your fingers and tapping your feet.    They've proven themselves to be a band that pays homage to other bands - although they are NOT a band of copycats. Interesting \\"arrivals\\" on this CD are: Blondie, the Bee-Gees, Wham! (oddly enough, on the soung \\"Paul McCartney\\"), Lennon's Beatles and McCartney's Beatles. They pay homage, but they - sorry for this redundant phrase - make the songs their own.    So Scissor Sisters didn't duplicate their first CD, but they did give us a marvelous CD perfectly in vein of the Scissor Sisters \\"sound\\". Every time I've listened to Ta-Dah! my enjoyment and appreciation for what they've done here has increased exponentially.    Time will tell if the songs I like on this CD will hold against \\"Take Your Mama Out Tonight\\" or \\"Comfortably Numb\\" and others, but so far I think they will. Even if they don't, I think that this is a more polished, complete and broad-ranged effort than their debut CD. They have grown, musically and lyrically, and it shows here. Tons of soul, tons of verve, full of soul and - of course - FUN.    I'm looking forward to the rest of the U.S. to pick up on these guys and give them the recognition they deserve. In this era of \\"compassionate conservatism\\" it's difficult to know if they will. One can only hope.    That said, Clay Aiken's CD debuted at #2 on Billboard this week...    10/5/06 - And this week, Ta-Dah! debuted at 19. If memory serves,that's higher than their debut album charted.
B000244FDW|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this version of Pride and Prejudice.  It is far superior to any other movie based on the novel.  My opinion is based on its true adherence to the book and its development of the characters.  Anyone will benefit from viewing this movie in conjunction with reading the book. It contains all the lessons that are inherent in the book, namely: (1) how ladies and gentlemen should (and should not) conduct themselves; (2) the effects of hasty judgment; and (3) what care parents should take in the upbringing of their children....at least these are some of the lessons I got out of it.  I am one of those people who believes the arts should both entertain and edify us, and this movie does both to perfection.
B000ASDFJU|3.0|This series is fantastic. Presentation is fantastic. <br />What happened to the picture quality on series 1 - 4 ? It is very grainy and at times looks like you are watching a bad copy. <br />Series 5 and 6 are better quality, but not fantastic. <br />I have exchanged three times now at the place of purchase, but still there is no improvement. <br />I have a new LCD tv and dvd, so it is not the equipment. <br />You really notice the poor quality when you watch another dvd. <br />I have just bought each series individually and the quality is much better. Go figure. <br />
B00002MZ4V|4.0|This is a really good John Williams compilation.  Rather than being only a single theme or melody from each of these movie scores, most of the tracks here are abridged concert suites.  I usually prefer to hear these shortened presentations of Williams' music; with the exception of Jurassic Park and Memoirs of a Geisha (and possibly the Star Wars scores), I find a full hour of one of his film scores a bit much, considering that a great deal of the complete soundtracks are spent repeating and reorchestrating the same few melodies.    Listening to this career retrospective, I was reminded of just how important Williams has been for American culture of the past thirty years.  He comminicates something of the American character in a way that very few other composers have: a comparison to Aaron Copland and George Gershwin is not inappropriate.  From the grassroots, backcountry Americana of the Reivers and Stepmom themes to the sense of swagger and bravado he captures in the Olympics theme and the big tunes of Stars Wars, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, and others, it is evident to me that Williams will long be remembered as one of the most important musicians of the American Age.    Movies with substantive and prominent scores are our culture's operas, and Williams is obviously first amongst movie composers.  This album is an outstanding profile of his career.
B00005K9QP|5.0|estamos en chicago? o es un espejismo...fredie king? otis rush?..NO: son borregos ingleses haciendo la mejor musica que puedas imaginar....estamos hablando de casi 40 años atras....cuando estos tipos descorcharon todo el blues y lo arrojaron en la cara a toda una generacion que lo desconocia..  versiones con polenta demoledora, el famoso tono de clapton aqui tiene su bautismo....realmente si no fue el principio de todo..estuvo cerca!!!!!!!!
B000H0MKGK|5.0|He's amazing. I have been listening to John since early 01 and every album just gets better. See him live if you can. I was lucky enough to get to do that last Sunday. Worth every penny. Worth double what I paid in fact. This is his most mature album and I LOVE the fact that he has gone back to his love of the blues. Slow Dancing In A Burning Room is on permanent rotation for me.
038572179X|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because apart from enjoying it, I was haunted by it and couldn't get it out of my head for weeks. I became a 'plot bore' to my friends and colleagues because I kept telling them about 'Atone ment'. I started reading it at 10am one morning and didn't put it down until 11pm. <br /> <br />I won't go through the story because previous reviewers have done that so beautifully and I can only reiterate the ones who have praised the beauty of the writing style. <br /> <br />I have never been so captivated by a narrative. The description of one day in the life of an upperclass family before WW11 told us EVERYTHING we needed to know about every single character. Being British the tragedy of Dunkirk ( but ultimate triumph because they did live to fight another day - we were taught at school) needed no introduction as it is a tale well told on these shores, but worth telling again nontheless.  <br /> <br />On a shallower note I read this novel because a couple of friends of mine are extras in the Dunkirk scenes of the film version of this book which is being made at the moment and they have told me it is pretty spectacular. It's in the hands of Joe Wright who last directed Pride and Prejudice, so the cinematography promises to be stunning. <br /> <br />Finally on an even shallower note I found the library sex scene extremely erotic.
B000089RVX|1.0|I never understood the hype over Evanescence. Amy Lee's voice is okay, but I think she tries too hard to sound so dramatic and emotional. As a band, something about them seems kind of fake to me with this whole \\"gothic/rock\\" thing. The lyrics are always so mediocre, while the music is so over the top and dramatic, and every song sounds exactly the same! I have nothing against goth, but seriously, there needs to be a new twist to this genre. It seems like they try way too hard to keep up with the whole \\"i'm goth, dark, and creepy\\" image. It's just getting sooo old and redundant, and is becoming more of an act. I think this band is overrated. To me they're just pop/rock artists trying way too hard to be goth, with not much substance in their music to make them interesting as a band.
B000059TEP|5.0|This is my #1 favorite movie.  I saw it again hours ago.  I could recall all scenes and 90% of the dialogue; so I was a bit surprised to find a few tears  running from my eyes at the ending scene.    I saw Ghost several times in its original theater run, which lasted for 1 - 2 months. That per se is a remarkable feat in our country, where movies generally run for only 1 - 2 weeks.  :-)
B000HA4W4S|4.0|This much anticipated deluxe edition of Ta-Dah, the latest music put out by the Scissor Sisters, is an inevitable sure fire hit for fans of the group everywhere! Yes, yes, I know, they didn't do precisely this sort of thing before, but it works here anyway. Just PLEASE give it a couple of listens and it will be growing on you fast. The deluxe edition includes a bonus disc with six creative tracks in addition to the main disc with the songs put out on the regular version of this album. The quality of the sound is excellent, too.<br /><br />The album starts off very strong with an infectious, catchy tune entitled \\"I Don't Feel Like Dancin'.\\" Elton John is on piano! This title is immediately very ironic since this song is so upbeat, beautifully written and joyous that you WILL feel like dancing to it as early as a minute or two after the song starts! The second bonus CD features a re-mix of this song; but the version on the first CD will leave you restless to dance and panting for more.<br /><br />Other great songs with awesome musical arrangements include \\"She's My Man;\\" \\"I Can't Decide;\\" \\"Land Of A Thousand Words\\" with its' dream-like, almost experimental/psychedelic musical intro; \\"Kiss You Off\\" which sounds like a mixture of pop and dance music and \\"Might Tell You Tonight\\" which reminded me of both The Bee Gees and some of Paul McCartney's earlier work from the 1970s. The final song, \\"Everybody Wants The Same Thing,\\" appeals to the universal quest for happiness, doing the right thing for yourself, and sharing love. This song boasts a magnificent musical arrangement that ends the CD on a very strong note.<br /><br />Indeed, the first CD is very strong throughout with meaningful songs and amazing arrangements involving issues of love, survival as we endure life's obstacles and a few traces of cynicism along the way for spice.<br /><br />The second CD, however, rocks on in its own way. The songs here have a distinct dance music flavor as opposed to the mostly pop feel of the first CD. The songs seem to be more creative as they involve risk taking with musical arrangements that feel decidedly more experimental. Indeed, the Scissor Sisters add that \\"Contact High\\" is a demo version of the song; we don't get to find out here if they polished this song further. Even the last song, the re-mix of \\"I Don't Feel Like Dancin',\\" is very noticeably different in its arrangement. Food for thought! One major exception is the song \\"Almost Sorry\\" which deals with a relationship that isn't exactly going well.<br /><br />And, of course, there's the packaging. Kudos to the reviewer who explained to us that you might try pulling out the right side of the box first to get the left side to release and come out! There's a CD enclosed on both sides: the main CD on the right and the bonus CD on the left. The package artwork is excellent; I liked the elevator theme and the fact that the \\"doors\\" of the elevator open as you pull out the two discs on both sides of the box. However, I did notice that it was somewhat difficult to pull the two sides out. I REALLY had to try to pull hard without damaging the box artwork! I may have bought a slightly defective box just by bad luck; I am not sure.<br /><br />The liner notes are included in the \\"elevator pocket\\" that you will see after both sides of the box have been pulled out. The liner notes are superb! You get full songs lyrics with lots of credits, thanks to everyone who helped and a really nice picture of the band.<br /><br />One unusual \\"special effect\\" is the Judy Garland dialogue near the end of the song entitled \\"The Other Side.\\" At first I wasn't sure how it would come off especially when I heard it was dubbed in from her talking into a tape recorder late at night when she was not always a \\"happy camper.\\" However, Judy's brief monologue fit in very nicely and it added a great deal of color to the song.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great two CD delight for Scissor Sisters fans! Yes, I know, they didn't do precisely this sort of thing in the past, but this is still great music. I give it four stars mainly because I had so much trouble with the packaging. I didn't like that I had to read instructions (???) from another reviewer just to know how to open the box, although I am certainly very grateful to that reviewer who told me how to open it!<br /><br />This excellent package is highly recommended for die-hard Scissor Sisters fans, fans of pop music, fans of experimental music, and fans of true creativity everywhere.know, they didn't do precisely this sort of thing in the past, but this is still great music.

0812975219|3.0|The author has some interesting things to say on randomness and probability and how it effects our day to day life. However what could have been an interesting long essay does not a book make! Furthermore he is really annoying in the way he makes snide and unjustified remarks about various people. For example - he may think Buffet is a lucky fool and he may be right (I do not understand the markets enough to judge this one). However he doesn't stop there. He goes on to attack Buffet for living a moderate life style (so what) and ends with musing if money isn't importent for Buffet why doesn't he become a monk or a social worker. Well this was before Buffet gave away most of his fortune and I hope Taleb is suitably shamed. I suspect this guy is fueled by envy and probably an inferiority complex (as he comes across as sooo superior).<br /><br />Also he is crazy about Popper (OK) but doesn't realize (or relate to) the issue that most Scientists don't work the way Popper thinks they do (For this see Kuhn or even Feyerbrand). As this is the only part of the book that I am qualified to comment on idea wise - and in my opinion it is a hodge podge - I wonder about the rest of it.
0895260131|2.0|This is an interesting book in that it does have valuable information regarding Islam and misconceptions regarding Islam. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the author uses every opportunity to add his own commentary and bias throughout the entire book.  From the very beginning the author sarcastically makes reference to Bill Clinton and leftist liberals.  He makes the assumption that political correctness is a left wing phenomenon. <br /> <br />Later, the option goes on to intermingle commentary regarding his perceived bias against \\"white\\" people and in favor of \\"darker skinned people\\", disregarding issues related to white Muslims, and dark skinned Christians.  The author describes discrimination and injustices against non-Muslims in the Middle East during the 1800s, while not even mentioning what was happening in the United States during that same time period. <br /> <br />The value of this book would have been realized by if the author had simply omitted the biased non-sense and focused on the subject described by his title.  As it stands the truth and good information is poisoned.
B0009UC7HA|2.0|Can you believe that a Confederate ironside wreck, The Texas, was found in the middle of the Sahara desert???! Then the 'good guys' use one of the canons to shoot down a helicopter. Yeah...that could happen! The rest of the script also seemed to be made up as they went along.  <br />  <br />This was obviously a financial venture for Matthew McConaughey, since he co-produced it. <br />
B00006I53S|5.0|I originally purchased a 30D with the low-end kit lens - to me the pricing didn't really make sense to get either the body or the higher-end IS kit lens. I was looking for a good all-purpose zoom with full-size sensor covereage in case I move up the Canon ranks to a new pro-level model in the future.  <br /> <br />The 28-135 fits the bill nicely. Although it is fairly heavy, the difference in build and image quality between the 18-55 kit lens is incomparable. This lens takes beautiful pictures and operates flawlessly. I highly recommend it as a day-to-day lens, and the IS is a nice feature for extending the range down a few stops without moving up to the much more expensive faster lenses.
B0006HC0I2|5.0|Yes, it is about gangsters. But to any Continental old enough to have seen this movie first in a small suburban movie theater full of smoke (when the basic idea was 'I will grow up and do this kind of things'), then to have seen it again in late night showings on a black-and-white TV (when it was already slightly fading away, towards nostalgia), and finally in poor VHS and in the admirable Criterion edition, it will be mostly about growing old, and experiencing that specific form of loneliness that is one of the glories of old males. Eating a leftover terrine of foie gras with a baguette in the company of an old friend may be more quintessential to spirit of this movie than any crime scene.
B00005NNMJ|5.0|I was a latecomer to Accept.  As a kid my doorway to metal was pretty traditional-Metallica, Megadeth, Maiden, Priest.  In fact, it wasn't uncommon many years ago to see an Iron Maiden, Anthrax or even Helloween album(cassette usually, sometimes cd.  Cd's were still kinda new at the time) at your local WalMart or other department store.  Imagine that!  Accept didn't really make it there, so I never really knew about them.  Many years later I get into them and love it.  Balls to the Wall ends a fantastic heavy metal trilogy that started with Breaker and continued with Restless and Wild.  These aren't the only good Accept albums, but you'd have to be a fool to call yourself an Accept fan and not have them.  Musically it's heavy and midpaced with the occasional speedy number thrown in.  Very powerful, very anthematic.  Udo is bar none one of the best metal vocalists ever.  Sure, on the books he'll always be a second stringer to Halford, Dickinson and Dio, but honestly I personally don't feel he's one iota beneath any of those giants.  Modern day metal audiences will just kinda laugh this off as silly, and most folks with any kind of recollection of the band are usually under the impression that Accept were some hair metal band that never quite made it.  In fact, Sony (who remastered this cd) placed a big ass sticker on the cover(on mine anyway) that screams Big Hair!! Big Hits!!  This pisses me off coz it proves that Sony had absolutely no idea of what they were remastering that day.  Anyone who thinks Accept is a silly hair band can take a flying jump at the moon for all I care.  Of course in a day when bands like Slipknot and HIM exist, who's to criticize something for being silly?  Anyhow, I'm ranting.  The point is, I'm not saying anything new to fans of the group, but to those wanting to expand their horizons and have an interest in checking out some of the golden days of heavy metal shouldn't be without this or one of the other two Accept albums.  It's Rockin'!  It's Udo! It's German!  It's Heavy Friggin' Metal!It's Udo! It's German!  It's Heavy Friggin' Metal!
B000GT7XXW|1.0|The download is bad, very bad. The quality is VHS on a hi-def 17 in monitor, and you CANNOT BURN IT TO A DVD AND WATCH ON YOUR TELEVISION!!! They say you can watch on large screen TV, NO! I have a direct monitor output to my Sony 42\\" HDTV and it looks no better than my VHS cassette, and you cannot burn to DVD to play in DVD player, it will only work on the computer! You cannot use Power DVD or Nero Showtime, it only plays on Windows Media Player.<br /><br />It's a rip-off! It's worthless. Protest. Don't buy!!!
B00006EXDM|5.0|i remember getting my first cd player for christmas when i was 14 with it i got a cd carrying various classic cd's, this cd was one of them.  to tell the truth i have been listing to the stones since i was 5, and i knew then i like the way they sounded.  being a kid i hadn't a clue about the various styles they played, but as i grew older and started appreciating music as a whole i relized that these guys will always be remebered as the bes of the best.  Ever since i got this cd, i have listened to it over and over, i am 24 now and for the first time i am going to see them live.  this set cements the fact that what ever these guys touch, turns to gold.  stripped is a shining example of what a comp cd should be, most comp cd's just touch on a bands greatnes, only having one or two hits and the rest the dregs of thier worst cd's.  don't get me wrong it's good to hear the less played songs, some the stones best stuff is hardly ever played o nthe radio, over all this is a must have in any cd collection
B000GRUS22|5.0|A great piece of music....for me!!! <br />I think you have to listen for more than 1 times that you can say is great <br />or not. <br />I think many of the tracks became their beautiful feeling after 4 or 5 listenings....okay try it and get this wonderful new CD!!!!
B000GRUS22|5.0|Find an hour and a half that you can have uninterrupted. At night..deep in the night. Alone in your room. If you're outside, find a safe place. On the rocks overlooking the sea. Lie on the grass under the open sky. Get ready. The CD in your Discman, Hi-Fi system or ipod. Ready? Hit play. <br /> <br />Listen with an open mind. Indulge your imagination. Engage your inner rhythm dancer. Move to the eclectic beat. Be regenerated. <br /> <br />My comments after 1st listen: This album is another departure from all previous Enigma's albums, yet distinctively has that Enigma feel and mysterious atmosphere. Free yourself from the shackles of the Gregorian chants or Indian screeches. Explore the unfamiliar caverns found  in this cutting-edge album. This is real New Age genre. PS I love \\"The Alchemist\\", \\"20,000 Miles Over The Sea\\", \\"Hello & Welcome\\" - new (album) version, \\"Invisible Love\\", \\"Northern Lights\\". \\"Dreaming of Andromeda\\", \\"Dancing with Memphisto\\", love the music on \\"Goodbye Milky Way\\" but not the wailing voice (which brings me back to earth again). <br /> <br />Buy this album for the unique experience of Enigma, but don't compare it with his previous albums because really, his music has been different among all these albums, and that I think is a reflection of his genius. PS  If Enya can be as radically different, I would be impressed :) - don't get me wrong, I love Enya, though sometimes I wish she can be as innovative. <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />
0060776757|5.0|Owning this book is literally like owning their history. The pictures are just beyond amazing. Every U2 picture you've ever seen do NO justice to how beautiful and charming these four men really are. Page after page after page reveals a facet to their lives with new, never-before-seen views into their past with humorous commentary to go with it. Just when you thought you'd seen and heard everything about U2... oh no my friend, you ain't seen NOTHIN' yet.  <br /> <br />Definitely a must-have for die-hard fans!
B000GRUS22|5.0|I admit...when I first listened to the album I was slightly disappointed. I thought the same thing about it being a bit repetitive. The songs seemed a bit incomplete. However, with each repeat listen, I liked it more and more. Now I absolutely am in love with it! It's definitely an album that needs to be experienced on headphones or a good sound system. Only then do you notice all the layers and subtleties, and realize just how incredible the production is. Michael Cretu (the man behind Enigma) has utilized so many cutting edge sounds and effects to create a stunning voyage through space and the night sky. There are fewer vocals than previous albums, which is quite a contrast to Voyageur, the most pop-influenced album. This one plays out more like a soundtrack for the mind and soul - more similar to earlier albums. You won't find many standout sing-along songs, but if you love that mysterious Enigma atmosphere, you should really dig this. I'm not crazy about \\"Goodbye Milky Way,\\" but the rest is incredible. \\"Feel Me Heaven\\" and \\"Dreaming of Andromeda\\" are probably my favorites, but most of the tracks are very close behind. I highly recommend giving this album repeated listenings before you pass judgment. It truly is amazing.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|First of the movie has many differences from the graphic novel. The comic had much more drug use and more anarchist themes, as well as V not being a simpathetic caring political warrior, he was much more of an anti-hero. But overall the movie was fabulous really showing what our society could be like in a few decades and I have been a fan of the wachowski bros. since the original matrix. The use of tchoivsky's 1812 overture was brilliant and hugo weaving was incredible.
0618680004|1.0|Richard Dawkins is an incredibly intelligent man.  His arguments for genes, evolution, and a logical and rational-based approach to understanding the universe are convincing, well documented, and eloquent.  When he approaches the concept of god, however, he falls uncharacteristically flat, and reveals that he is completely out of his element.  The problem we have is with Dawkins's own concept of god: a Santa Claus in the sky, trapped in time and space, and ultimately confined to Dawkins's own imagination. <br /> <br />His argument that a god cannot exist because one would have to explain where he came from is clearly a thought process trapped in the confines of creature time, revealing the fact that Dawkins, despite his excelling intellect, cannot conceive of anything which exists outside of the five senses.  God, which is argued in the Islamic tradition, is outside of creation and thus, not subject to time, space, or matter.  He, we are told, is the creator of these things and therefore not subject to the questions of when (time), where (space), or matter (what).  For how can the one who created time be subject to it?  How can the one who created space be confined to it?  This is quite logical, which surprises me that Dawkins would argue against such a flawed concept of God.  It is often said to atheists who hold such views: \\"Which 'god' don't you believe in, because I probably don't believe in that 'god' either.\\" <br /> <br />By creating a hypothesis of a god trapped in six directions and then demolishing that hypothesis, Mr. Dawkins is doing nothing more than demolishing his own understanding of god, which needless to say is not accomplishing much.  Whereas many may find this book riviting, it is a strawman argument if there ever were one and a break in the armor, exposing the inadequacy of this previously-perceived invincible warrior of militant atheism.
0385510454|2.0|Grisham is one of my favorite authors. However this one is not one of his bests! We all understood that he loved Bologna and the culture of Italy. It is a nice written travelogue but this is not what I want to get from a Grisham novel. What about the pace, the adventure, the chase..? <br /> <br />And talking about the end...could it be more simple?  <br /> <br />Those who are familiar with Bologna or the Italian Culture, or those willing to visit Italy, you can enjoy but those willing to find a real thrilling novel, try something else.
B00005B36H|5.0|I usually listen to music that makes me feel good. I also listen to music that describes my personality. But Tool (which is my #1 favorite band in the world) music describes my inner thoughts, feelings, and personality..I think it's probably why i can get enough of tool.I've first heard of Tool through... the Parabola video that they showed on MTV's All things that Rock in the summer of 2002, and i have never left the since.  But.., this CD is truely a masterpiece and i would advise anyone to get this album to listen to be \\"enlighten\\" by some \\"Genius Album\\"...I love this CD........Great music........ <br /> <br /> <br />Every song is my favorite off this album, but My favorite track may have to be.\\"Lateralus\\"....It's truly the inner core of this album.... <br /> <br />EVERY ROCK FAN SHOULD GET THIS ALBUM BECAUSE......IT'S JUST ......PERFECT....(My opinion)
B000HA4W4S|2.0|When I heard \\"IDFLD\\" I was ecstatic. It's a perfect song and I was truly excited to hear an onslaught of MORE great songs from the SS. It's taken some time, but I've come to like a few more tracks on this album, the best ones being #1,3, and 10. There are still those I hate (\\"Kiss You Off\\" = AWFUL). It almost is like listening to a different band, if you were to use their debut in comparison. This is more of a concept album than anything, and it wasn't what I expected. For that reason I have decided to upgrade it to 3 stars. As far as the packaging on this edition goes, I rather like it. I tried to cut open the right side of the package with the rounded edges hoping I could leave the cellophane on to protect it, but soon realized it all had to come off in order for the \\"doors\\" to open! Very clever, though it's sad that the package is more entertaining than the recordings contained within.    Now, I've read they're going to appear on \\"Dancing With The Stars\\"?!?!?!! What a disgrace. Talk about shredding one's cred for the sake of exposure. I'm going to be sick.
B000HCO83Q|4.0|I am a big X-men fan.  This movie does not have great character depth (something fans of the comics were not too happy about.)  Having read several hundred issues of X-men, I consider myself well versed.  I still really enjoyed the movie.  It was a fun movie to watch and that was all I really cared about. <br /> <br />That said, I think it is too bad that Halle Berry was ever cast as Storm.  She has managed to get worse as the series has progressed.  She threw one of her classic little tantrums for X3 and more or less FORCED them to increase her role in the third movie or she would otherwise quit.  Very sadly they did, and the film suffered.  The rest of the cast was very good.  Jackman plays a great \\"wolverine\\" as always.  Many new characters were introduced and they were all well cast and played. <br /> <br />Basically the lack of character development was a bit of a let down, but in no way ruins the movie.  Sadly it is Berry that kept this from a five star film, her performance was even worse than in the second film, and she was in enough scenes this time around that it became apparent just how bad she was.  Watch the film \\"Catwoman\\" if you would like to see just how aweful she can be, it is a hilarious film without intending to be. <br /> <br />It is still a very fun movie, and atleast on DVD you can fast forward through Halle's \\"acting\\"
B000056TKC|4.0|I chose the words \\"stalwart\\" and \\"not very memorable\\" as a quote from  The Gramopone review of this 1957 Beethoven Ninth under Fricsay. I admire him and own a dozen recordings of his, but d I can't understand the rapture his Ninth has prompted here, goodd as it is. The first movement is rather foursquare and stoic. Fricsay's forward-moving tempo carries us along, yet mystery and depth are both lacking.<br /><br />The Scherzo is brisk and lively, as one would expect from this always alert musician. At 18 min., the Adagio is taken broadly, in the traditional mode. The Berlin Phil. hadn't yet been fully developed by Karajan, its new conductor, so we don't get the polish and depth of his Ninth, to be recorded five years later. But Fricsay has a lovely, gentle way with the melodic line--he was never one to stretch for profundities. The great climax lacks something in intensity, however.<br /><br />The finale begins with a fairly tame outburst, not the wild discordancy one expects, then the famous tune is beautifully shaped. At the start of the vocal part, Fischer-Dieskau, a baritone, is not the sonorous bass that Beethoven calls for, but his artistry makes up for that. In fact, the whole vocal quartet is highly energized, which helps to make the finale the most vital movement. Suddenly we get a surge of energy, and the excellent St. Hedwig's choir is up to the task. Last impressions are important, and the vibrancy of Fricsay's finale arouses one's ethusiasm.<br /><br /> But one of the great Beethoven Ninths? I can't agree.
0618680004|4.0|Dr Dawkins takes on a huge task and forcibly enters a conflict which is as old as religion, namely the veracity of God (however defined). As the subject is old and religion innoculates itself from scientific testing - many of the metaphysical points cannot lead to a conclusion. <br /> <br />Has it ever been different with philosophy and metaphysics ? <br /> <br />Dawkins hits his stride when he discusses plausible sociobiological forces which plausibly cause religion to take hold and grow in a society. This chapter is worth the price of the book and more importantly, the time and consideration of the reader. <br /> <br />Dawkins is a very straight shooter, which is the reason he is so hated by the agents of pseudo science and social nonsense. However, this clarity of thought and expression allows him to bring light to issues that are often unclear <br /> <br />Examples : <br /> <br />Problem of evil - \\"Explained by the fact that the God of the Bible qualifies as evil by all reasonable conventional definitions.\\" <br /> <br />Problem of improbability - \\"Nonrandom natural selection on undirected variation\\" <br /> <br />However, some of the points lose power by being overdone. Illustrating that most religious belief is based on weak foundations is too easy although accurately accomplished. God is best dispensed with by parsimony. Trying to answer the unknown with a mystery does not accomplish anything, indeed - it just invents an unnecessary additional layer of ignorance. <br /> <br />Lastly, it would have been interesting if Dawkins had linked social religion with games theory somewhat. Yes, our religion is nonsense - but we may be at a selective disadvantage if we dispense with our nonsense and the other tribe does not. What would be the best memes to combat religion everywhere ? <br /> <br />After all, very few rationalists are willing to fly a airliner into a building for 72 clear white raisins.
B00005MJ13|5.0|I came late to the party with this recording, which I hadn't run across until today. But now that I have, bravo! Fricsay is refreshingly spontaneous in this Dvorak Ninth from 1962, aided by very close-up and detailed miking of the orchestra. His free tempos in every movement take unexpected turns, and every phrase is shaped with energy and vibrancy.  The sonics are fine in DG's remastering, although there's a hint of shatter and crunch in the loudest climaxes.  It's a cliche to say that Hungarian conductors are fiery, but Fricsay certainly fits that description here, and the Berlin Phil. follow his lead with total commitment. All in all, a must-listen.<br /><br />The second longest work here is Liszt's Les Preludes, performed with Fricsay's own orchestra, the Berlin Radio Sym.  When he began recording with them just after the war, they were a bedraggled bunch, but Fricsay raised their standards year by year. They play ardently for him, although the strings aren't first rate, and his interpretation, which is gently lyrical and well shaped in the big tune, generates excitement without turning into a tub-thumper. I'd call it a totally winning performance.<br /><br />The remainder of this generous Cd (70+ min.) is given over to The Moldau, again with the Berlin Phil.  Fricsay conducts a swift reading--it starts out as a scramble--but gives the music such a buoyant lift that it's irresistible.
B000GPIPTW|5.0|I have never heard this whole album before, just various songs from it on different compilation CD's and what not.  I picked up this new 40th Anniversary edition tonight.  I just now finished listening to it, and words cannot describe the beauty of this album.  The harmony's and instrumentals are simply off the charts and out of this world.  Not just one song or several songs, but this whole album; it is simply a masterpiece.  And the stereo versions of the tracks are simply mind blowing.  Mr. Paul McCartney of the Beatles was right on the money, God Only Knows was the best song ever written and that Pet Sounds IS the album of all time.  Go pick up this copy if you have not already.
B000HCO83Q|5.0|I was astonished to see all the negative comments made about this movie.  It would made a terrible introduction to the X-Men trilogy, but as a long-time movie fan I was highly impressed. <br /> <br />Director Brett Ratner has created an immensely exciting and dramatic movie.  He doesn't bother with the character development that Bryan Singer put into the first two.  However if you found that Singer's stylized, hushed, melodramatic approach to character did nothing to improve X-Men and X2, Ratner's slam-bang action will be a breath of fresh air. <br /> <br />Wolverine and Storm both have increased roles in this movie.  Fortunately Halle Berry, while an interesting member of the cast, does not dominate the screentime.  Wolverine gets several good scenes. <br /> <br />The action scenes are absolutely spectacular.  The final battle on Alcatraz Island is just that, a battle with hundreds of participants in a fight to the death.  Wolverine vs. Deathstrike in X2 was probably the best single combat scene, but there's action on every level and enough to satisfy without taking over the emotional tension. <br /> <br />Speaking of emotional tension, this one is screaming with it.  Logan and Rogue in particular are faced with agonizing decisions.  Sadness, revenge and romance are combined in a movie that feels half as long as it is. <br /> <br />Many people are upset over the bitterly ironic fates that several of the characters meet. Admittedly X-Men: The Last Stand isn't as much of a feel-good movie as, say, Fantastic Four.  But it's better.  And when has being exceptional ever been easy? <br /> <br />In conclusion, I found this movie a breathtaking, edge-of-your-seat, climactic finish to three really good movies.  I don't know the comic books, so there may be objections I can't talk about.  But as a movie-watcher I consider this the best of the trilogy, worth watching, buying and watching again.
6305692572|5.0|I remember the first time I saw this movie.  It was a stretch outside the normal Meg Ryan 'Look at me, I'm cute' role.  Here was a real woman with real issues.  And Andy Garcia just stole my heart with the depth of love he had for his wife.  The ending wasn't wrapped in a perfect bow either...it ends with promise and hope and with the one thing that never waivered.  The good love of a good man.  Highly highly recommended.
0618680004|3.0|... but why do all the reviews in favor of this sound the same? If this is any indication, it means that Dawkins is almost certainly wrong when he states that \\"atheism nearly always indicates a healthy independence of mind.\\"
B000009EUM|5.0|SCOUNDREL DAYS may be a-ha's best album. This is a great album! No other band has such a lyrical and melodic sound as they have. \\"The Swing Of Things\\" is excellent. \\"I've Been Losing Myself\\" is really touching. No other band could have performed these songs or delivered them with such a unique sound. It's good to see that they are still in good form with ANALOGUE.
B000BNI95Y|4.0|After only a few listens, I already love this album. It'll only be a matter of time before Bebe becomes a big international star. I predict artists as varied as Madonna, Xtina, and Gwen Stefani will want to record an english language song with her. Her defiant Chrissie Hynde look will no doubt give a lot of young latin boys wet dreams, but in the end her experimental sensibilities will win her a larger appreciative audience. She is too unique (and daring) to be ignored.
B000AV2G3I|5.0|My mom was a big Beatles fan so I am familiar to a degree with his music and the distinctive sound of his voice. I think this album sounds very good and I like the choice of songs. You enjoy John or you don't for one reason or another. I like his sound and listen to it and that's very satisfying for me. Always enjoy what we were given and what remains.
B000667GFK|5.0|Recuerdo cuando oí la música de Luis Miguel para la primera vez en 1988 en Acapulco desde entonces yo adoré su música. Deseo que un día yo pueda ver Luis Miguel en concierto. Esto es un gran álbum y merece el reconocimiento. Nadie canta como Luis Miguel, él canta con la emoción y la compasión. Adoro México y su cultura y todo tienen que ofrecer a un Italiano como mí que vive en Toronto. Viva México y Luis Miguel.
B000G759FS|5.0|I seldom submit my own reviews, but this album is extraordinary.  This is THE Randy Crawford album to own!!  I have all of Randy's recordings - and love them all - but this one stands alone.   <br /> <br />She is backed by a small combo (including Christian McBride on bass and Ray Parker, Jr. on guitar); no strings or big arrangements, but they are hot!  Randy and Joe Sample are perfect together (again).  Randy's vocals are jazzier than usual and she and Joe seem to inspire one another.  The disc has Randy's usual covers of standards and pop hits (Feeling Good, But Beautiful, Everybody's Talking, When I need You), some re-makes of her own recordings (Rio de Janiero Blue and Last Night at Danceland) and some unfamiliar (to me) fare and not a boring cut on the album. <br /> <br />The price: ugh!  I guess it's currently available only as an import (recorded in NYC & LA but distributed out of Argentina!).  No matter what, it's definitely worth the price.
B000000W5L|4.0|This is one of those items in pop culture that has gained a reputation as something that is supposed to be fantastic. You are supposed to love it, to think it is one of the greatest albums of all time. It always amazes me that people buy into these things. <br /> <br />I am a HUGE Stones fan, and while I like this album, it is definitely not five stars.  Even Mick Jagger has commented that he doesn't understand why people say it is such a great album.  It has four or five really great songs on it, but it also has a lot of filler.  Not good enough for a double album -- should have been a superb single album. <br /> <br />If you want a true five star Stones album, get \\"Sticky Fingers\\".
0060263857|5.0|I just reread it recently as an adult. I had this boxed set of three hardcover E.B. White books when I was a kid - Charlotte's Web, The Trumpet of the Swan (which I remember as my favorite of the three, though I hardly remember it today), and Stuart Little.  <br /> <br />I was so happy when the cheap paperback they ordered here was the same printing - same illustrations and everything. Anyway, coming back to it as an adult (or sort of adult) was surprising - it was so beautifully laid out, the tone, the story, the dark deep themes - as a short novel, it stands with the best of literature. I know there's no such thing as a \\"perfect\\" novel, but as far as any literary criteria can be applied, it is absolutely beautiful - symmetrical in all the right places, gentle as it deals with the harshness of life, all the dark undertones - the sheep in the background with their collective understated cruelty, Templeton the amoral hedonist, the cruelty of time that makes little girls grow up - and yet somehow tenderness persists.  <br /> <br />It's elegant and real and cosmic and full of quaint Americana. Certainly not only for children. A fine novel by any standards.
B000FVQM2Y|1.0|For those not in the know, \\"I love lamp\\" is a quote from another Brick, he of \\"Anchorman\\" fame. I thought the quote was kinda fitting, in that the Brick from that movie made no sense either.<br /><br />This is one of those movies where you're going to read a lot of overblown, pretentious reviews from people who like to pretend they \\"get it\\", throwing phrases like \\"film noir\\" at you like they actually have a clue what they're talking about. Ladies and gentlemen - IGNORE THEM ALL.<br /><br />So, Brick, then. An attempt to fuse, oh-ho, \\"film noir\\" in a teenage environment. A nice idea, if it weren't so knuckle-chewingly embarrassing to watch. Hey, who wants to see 15 year olds talking like Humphrey Bogart, with all the conviction of an episode of Dawsons Creek? Anyone? Anyone?<br /><br />The director was obviously so in love with his outrageous gimmick that he forgot to add even the slightest personality into his characters. This is one reason we do not care, one little bit, about anyone we're watching on screen - also the fact we don't believe ANYTHING we're watching, it's all so pointlessly ludicrous.<br /><br />There is a good story buried under the corny dialogue and leaden delivery.  It would be no less powerful if these were REAL teenagers in front of us, saying REAL things that teenagers have to say. There doesn't have to be bling-speaking idiots or Clueless-style stereotypes in a teenage movie.  A film written by someone with the slightest idea of what teenage kids are actually like would be a start, (one person in the entire school has a mobile phone, for example) but what there DOES need to be is an actual story, with characters that people can relate to or at least care about - otherwise, what's the point?<br /><br />Of course, the knee-jerk reactionary brigade are going to accuse me of being ignorant for not adoring their Movie Of The Year (that they were told to like). They'll say I didn't \\"get it\\". Oh, I got it - I just don't particularly want it.<br /><br />Pretentious I can deal with. \\"Film noir\\" I can deal with. Trying something new, trying to be different - I can deal with. A tedious, gimmicky chore? The Curmudgeon can not deal with.<br /><br />You want to see this year's best non-blockbuster movie?

B0007Y08QA|4.0|Bale is a wonderful and amazing actor.  His character, who is declining in a mysterious way, is at times creepy, charming, and full of potential as a person.  But there is some kind of problem - as expressed by his seeming descent into insanity  that is at the root of his freak out.  This is a subplot that moves along with the weird symptoms, where the viewer doesn't necessarily know what is real.  While this is not original, the acting makes it quite rivetting.  I will not want to watch this again, but it was well worth it and frighteningly vivid.<br /><br />Recommended as excellent cinema.
0192838679|5.0|What I love about this book, aside from the fact that it maintains a voyeuristic appeal through its epistolary form, is that it is cerebrally sexual.<br />Laclos' language is gorgeous and his subtlety is sublime. The book is wildly sexual but never crass or disgusting.<br />Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont are the absolute paragons of villainy  you will love to hate.<br />The book is at its simplest level a study of the total destruction of naivete and innocence, but you can be sure that just desserts will be served all around.<br />A fantastic novel...if only de Laclos had written more!<br />Also, the movie version starring Glenn Close and John Malkovich is wonderful as well--but of course, I recommend reading the novel first.
038073186X|2.0|Two Federal Marshals are dispatched to a remote island housing a mental institution for the criminally insane to look for a missing patient named Solando.  Throw in a Hurricane that traps the Marshalls on the island, a lot of strange behavior, and you have the premise for Shutter Island.<br /><br />The book does not live up to the expectations Dennis Lehane's readers expect from him (although looking at the other reviews I could be dead wrong about that).  There are glimmers of Lehane's talents, but the book feels like a rushed screen play.  There is action, there is mystery, there are menacing situation, but it is all very glossy and superficial.  The reader will also probably solve the mystery by page 150.<br /><br />It is not all grim however.  The book does flow nicely, reads easily and the last 25 pages were very powerful emotionally.  I did enjoy the book, but would expect something like this from James Patterson (this would be an achievement for him) but not from a fresh talent like Dennis Lehane
B000B8657S|3.0|I concur in full with the previous review of this marvelous collection.  The liner notes, photos, and additonal information from Graham Johnson in the original individual discs were the best I have ever read. I have about a dozen of them. I was sorely disappointed to find in the big box only a small-print version of the songs, convenient in one place, but without the splendid commentaries. Bring on the bukly reprint!
B000E97Y6K|5.0|The classic gigantic-ape-in-mistery-island story comes again to life under the magnificent direction of Peter Jackson, who utterly proves himself as one of the most important filmmakers in history, by delivering a visually stunning as well as dramatically engaging movie.     Despite the perils of a very worn-out story line, the movie ends up as a masterpiece of modern cinematics and it is undoubtedly due to a solid and well-written script framed within a clear director's vision and accompanied by a great cast of actors.     Skillfully, Jackson manages to avoid the temptation of just filling up the screen with flamboyant mega digital effects and ultimately finds the adequate balance between state of the art computer graphics (which are simply amazing here) and the need of giving a sense of reality onscreen (even within the fantasy of the plot). As a result, King Kong won't leave audiences with the feeling of having watched a 3-hour long video game in the movie theater. Instead you'll enjoy three hours or so of truly great cinema.
B000G759LW|5.0|I just don't understand. I listen to this cd over and over again and it is excellent!!!! Britney, Jessica, and the rest of \\"pretty pop princesses\\" need to step back!!! Christina has the look, the voice, and the cd of the year!!!  Also for people who says that Christina over-sings her songs, they are usually the ones who CAN'T sing themselves. Get real!!! You better recognize talent when it is in your face!!!
B000F8O4DQ|3.0|I must have some nerve thinking that I can review any album by the Electric Light Orchestra - especially this album. Somehow, against all odds, I managed to ignore this band when they were in their prime, and \\"A New World Record\\" certainly represents E.L.O. at their height of fame. Considering that their prime coincided with my own high school years, that was not an easy thing to do, but it is dubiously impressive. Back then, key tracks from this album were played incessantly on the radio, and most kids my age accepted the band without any hesitation. I didn't. I thought of them as fatuous, overtly commercial and derivative copycats. In retrospect, it's hard for me to understand my nasty, or at best indifferent, perspective. My own youthful limitations certainly had something to do with it; E.L.O. weren't as cool or hard as Led Zeppelin, their musicianship wasn't as intuitive as the Allman Brothers, and their arrangements were less intriguing than Yes. They were completely different, but they were caught on the same stylistic middle ground as Elton John, and in 1977, that wasn't a particularly cool place to be.<br /><br />So, naturally my aged prejudice now informs my present opinion. As I listen to this thirty year-old album today, it sounds like I should have liked it then, so what gives? For starters, my tastes in music have changed dramatically since 1976, so I can finally hear what my peers heard when we were teenagers. I was ill-equipped to admit it then, but \\"A New World Record\\" is consistently good throughout. The album's equalization still sounds oddly flat, like somebody lopped off the high end, but the music holds up in ways that I never would have imagined. \\"Telephone Line\\" is artfully written ands tastefully arranged. The string arrangements that once struck me as grandiose and pompous now sound quaint and simple. \\"Do Ya\\" still sounds like a rock and roll composite of one thousand other bands, but nobody else could have combined so many ingredients as skillfully as Jeff Lynne does here. \\"Livin' Thing\\" impressed me even then (`tho I never admitted it), and its combination of schmaltzy pseudo-classical references with wise-guy doo-wop is much more original than I originally considered it to be. Will a new audience reap the same benefits as me? I doubt it. This album will offer little to today's high school crowd, but if you remember the bicentennial and graduated while wearing Earth shoes, you may owe it to yourself to pick up a new copy of E.L.O.'s \\"New World Record.\\" B+ Tom Ryanully as Jeff Lynne does here. \\"Livin' Thing\\" impressed me even then (`tho I never admitted it), and its combination of schmaltzy pseudo-classical references with wise-guy doo-wop is much more original than I originally considered it to be.

B00005V0X5|3.0|Dave Mustaine has been leading Megadeth for well over 20 years now, and it all started with \\"Killing is My Business...and Business is Good\\" way back in 1985. While this album doesn't stack up well against their more famous releases (\\"Peace Sells...But Who's Buying\\" and \\"Rust in Peace\\" in particular), it does have its own merits and is worth checking out for any fan of their music for at least history's sake.  <br /> <br />The production is not particularly good at all which is the main difference between this and latter albums. The musicianship is certainly not that bad, it's just that the sound is very, very raw from start to finish. I guess Metallica and Slayer also had debut albums that were far rawer produced than the rest of their discographies. There are plenty of high speed thrashing riffs and shredding lead work on show. Dave's vocal style can get a little ugly at times and I guess it's a bit of a love it or hate it scenario.  <br /> <br />Highlights for me are the raging \\"Rattlehead\\" and \\"Looking Down the Cross\\". It's worth noting that there are a few different versions of this album out there so make sure you get the one you want. One has a cover version of These Boots complete with multiple swear words, one completely omits the cover and then there's the remastered edition which includes the track albeit with beeped out expletives.  <br /> <br />This is not an album I listen to very often. Following albums by Megadeth are far superior (well, most of them anyway) in so many ways and I don't really find value in this one any more. But it served its purpose at the time, and it's certainly a seriously thrashing piece of metal. I guess it's for the really big Megadeth fans out there that have to have all their albums.
0060989157|4.0|Ok first off I have to say right out the box, I don't care what any of you snooty artsy hipper than thou types say, Motley Crues first two albums were GREAT!<br /><br />Ok now that I've got that out of the way, not that this isn't a very entertaining book, but after reading this I am convinced now more than ever that these guys are complete and total morons who are lucky if they have IQ's more than a few points higher than plant life. The appeal of this book is of course the wild over the top sex, drugs, car crashes, brushes with the law, wild times on the road type of stories. As far as party animal rock star tales this book can't really be beat, just don't expect anything particuarly intellectual, although I did feel sad for Vince Neils ordeal having to go through his daughters slow grueling and eventual death by cancer, but just be happy to hear stories of conquests of celebrity bimbos, drugging and drinking, inter band squabbles and car crashes. Then crack a beer and get out Motley Crues first album and Shout at the Devil, turn it up and bring back memories of your days as a teen metal head.
B0002EXH54|5.0|Megadeth have really had an up and down career. A few of their albums will always be remembered as thrash classics while others are almost laughably misguided (\\"Risk\\" for example). \\"Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?\\" is undoubtedly one of the albums to be labelled a classic along with 1990s \\"Rust in Peace\\". When you consider that it was released in the same year as Slayer's \\"Reign in Blood\\" and Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets\\", it's hard to deny that 1986 was a hugely defining year for metal music.    I wasn't particularly impressed with Megadeth's debut album \\"Killing is My Business...and Business is Good!\\", but this album absolutely blew me away. What had previously appeared to be a second rate, poor mans Metallica, had suddenly transformed into a thriving entity with a sound all their own. There were no changes in line-up between the two releases and yet the quality of musicianship increased dramatically. The rawness of the previous album was left behind and replaced with crystal clarity. Rather than just thrashing wildly, \\"Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?\\" is filled with awesome riff after awesome riff, not to mention truly brilliant lead work by Dave Mustaine and Chris Poland. I'd have to say it's the soloing that really elevates this album to such heights. It's more and more a lost art these days which is hard to understand since when they are done well, solos add character and texture to solid foundations. Just check out \\"Good Mourning / Black Friday\\" for inspired fret board activity!    Whereas Mustaine's vocals were rather awkward in the past, he'd now found a style and theme that perfectly complimented his unique technique. The subject matter swings between a tongue in cheek rebelliousness and horror / science fiction elements. Tracks such as \\"Peace Sells\\" displays the anti-government behaviour, while others such as \\"The Conjuring\\" present a more fictitious movie inspired premise. Both would become customary ingredients of the Megadeth blueprint and even be successfully combined on \\"Rust in Peace\\" with government cover-ups of alien visitations.    I love almost every song on the album, although I have to say \\"Devil's Island\\" isn't quite as good and the cover \\"I Ain't Superstitious\\" doesn't really fit the album all that well. I'm really quite opposed to covers appearing on albums. Unless they can be played in a very similar style and mood as all the surrounding tracks, then they tend to be nothing more than disruptive. I say save them for the EPs or compilation albums and this one's no different. But if that's the worst thing I have to say about \\"Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?\\", then it's obviously an album I thoroughly enjoy. With classics such as \\"Wake Up Dead\\", \\"The Conjuring\\" and the title track, this is nothing if not a thrashing masterpiece. If you don't already have it, go get it!
B000002L3P|4.0|The two opening cuts are great!  Deja Voodoo sold me on this album it's self.  Kenny was a lot younger at this time, and you can tell he was still trying to find his identity as a picker (he found it on the Live On album IMO).   <br />Some have criticized him for ripping off Pearl Jam, and I'll be honest...I think While We Cry is definitely derived from Pearl jam's \\"Yellow Ledbetter.\\"  But...neither Gossard nor McCready could play what Shepherd played on this tune.  I agree that Shepherd shouldn't have taken credit for this song as being his own, but he smokes on this tune more than Pearl Jam could ever hope to.  At the end of the day, I don't think KWS will ever be remembered for this tune anyway, as most people know him for Blue On Black, but by all means...Live On is an exceptional album that needs to be heard by anyone who knows about Kenny Wayne Shepherd. <br />This album is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone who likes guitar driven blues.
B000H305U0|1.0|I love Justins music from Justified but this album was not his best work.  I know JT can do better.  This CD was just consumed with too many beats and not enough of vocal variety.  I think he is trying something new, but I like the old Justin a lot better.  I am still a fan but this CD just was not his best work by far.  If you dont have Justified, GET IT.  Thats an awesome CD.
B00004U8P9|5.0|This is the perfect celebration of B- and horror-movies of the 30s and 40s...<br /><br />I first heard about it while staying at Gran Canaria, Spain and lots of dragqueens took a \\"How do joooooooooo doooooooooAAAAAAAAAAA\\" a`la Tim Curry hehehe.........<br /><br />The cast and crew are first rate and though the excitement halts into the middle the movie, it has a big finish:-)))
B000GUJHIA|4.0|I have just finished Mr.Judt's tome on modern Europe. I am a little embarrassed to admit that it took me several months. I enjoyed learning the information; the book is certainly filled with detail. It is not by any means an easy read or a \\"page turner, \\" however. Although I agree with some other reviewers that the US' role is deemphasized a bit, overall I felt the author was fairly objective. In contrast to a reviewer's comment that the French will love this book, I would argue that the author reveals the French during this period  as deeply flawed. Certainly the Soviet leadership  properly receives a great deal of blame, as do many of the citizenry throughout Europe.  I agree that the book's strength lies in the breadth of the information, which at first seems overwhelming but is kept semi-manageable. Mr. Judt is less successful in neatly synthesizing all the info, but I personally think that that is primarily a realistic function of the subject matter. I did find the epilogue discussing specifically the treatment of jews a little jarring in its placement.  <br />     In sum, for the average reader interested in history, the book is an ambitious, worthy, and overall well-written endeavor. Be prepared for a bit of a slog, however.
B000GGSMF8|4.0|I'm not entirely sure what listeners who aren't familiar with most of the original versions will get out of this album. As someone who went through punk, new wave, new romantic, goth and indie-kid phases in the late 70's/early 80's but who now listens to lounge, bossa, dub and nu-jazz I'm surely part of a very small group to whom Nouvelle Vague's work is perfectly pitched.  The standouts for me are the sublime opening track and a kittenish reworking of Human Fly. Some of the other covers work less well, including a way-too-respectful attempt at Pride. Potential buyers should also be warned that there several different editions of this CD aimed at various international markets. Check the tracklistings before buying  Never thought I'd ever again listen to Bela Lugosi's Dead by choice...
B000BW7QWW|5.0|The setting, the plot, the look and effects, along with some of the characters, owe a lot to Star Wars.  The feel of the acting and the sense of humor, along with some of the characters, are very like writer/director Whedon's other work, including his best known, Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  And, as in that series, there is a 17-year-old girl with superhuman gifts kicking human and monster butt with martial arts (though no vampires, per se).<br /><br />It works well, on the whole.  There's plenty of action, enough character development to be interesting, romance, pop philosophy of the kind you get in Star Wars and Star Trek, and a mix of moral ambiguities among strong moral values that's distinctively Whedon.  Some of the sentimentality stuck out enough to make me squirm a couple times, but it's handled with a leavening humor.  No need to say a lot more.  If you enjoyed Star Wars or Whedon's other work, you're likely to enjoy this.
B000F0UUT6|5.0|I would award this DVD set 6 STARS if I could. The Making Pride and Prejudice book (120 pages) included in this set is worth the entire purchase price. This film rendition is the best, it includes many important parts of the original writing of Jane Austen that were ommitted by the 2005 movie with Keira Knightley and MacFadyen. And no one can miss the FACT that Colin Firth's portrayal of Mr. Darcy is stellar and affecting, not to mention flawless. Buy this and enjoy it sooner rather than later.
0385336691|5.0|I can't add much to the good things said about this character and series - except to ask Lee Child to write faster.  I appreciate his female characters, they (while, of course, attractive) are NOT 20-something bimbos, but generally intelligent older professionals - you know, akin to the real world?  And, I admit it, I enjoy it when Jack physically smacks down the bad guys, so I'd like more of that.  (I'd like to see Reacher dropped into a foreign country sometime).  A stranger in a drugstore was browsing and asked if I had read some of these - I told the guy you can't go wrong with this series - \\"The Hard Way\\" is now a personal favorite along with \\"Persuader\\" and \\"Echo Burning\\"
B000GG4Y32|5.0|In 1981, the year Reds was released, the world was seeing a decayed and backrupt political system. Communissim was gasping its last breath in Romania, Serbia. Hungry, Poland and the former Yugosalavia and Czechoslovakia. The \\"Red Menance\\" was not so scary afterall. Regan was still in the White House and could watch the Berlin Wall crumble on TV. Such were the times when Warren Beatty choose to tell the story of John Reed. Here was history's eye whitness to the birth of the longest and most pervasive totalitarian rule the world would ever know. And how was it that an American journalist came to tell the story? Beatty manages to succeed on several levels. First and foremost the story is woven out over three plus hours with such skill and precision that I would not want a single scene cut. I have absolutely no quarrel with the editing. The story simply could not be told and the impact would not be as great were it even twenty minutes shorter.     After giving us access to the events central to the story, Warren Beatty takes us into the life behind the story, the life of John Reed, an extarordinary man, who covered the story for the leftest newspaper \\"The Masses\\". If all this were not enough, we're also allowed to explore Reed's life, through the eyes and words of some of the most dynamic and influencial personalities of the early twentith century. Like a real life \\"Rag Time\\" or \\"Forest Gump\\" Reed's life becomes a lightening rod, attracting and interacting with famous personalities like Eugene O'Neil, played by Jack Nicholson with tremendous intensity and depth and Emma Goldman, played by Maureen Stapleton. She delivers an oscar worthy supporting performance and one of her finest roles ever. These and many others provide a panoramic view of world shattering events that took place in Eastern Europe and Russia in the early part of the last century. To Beatty's credit he manages to inter-weave these characters into  chronological order, placing them in different parts of the world at precise moments in history. This historical backdrop provides the emotional core within the relationship between the central characters, played with superlative chemestry by Beatty and Keaton.    Warren Beatty hit his stride with Reds. This is film making that deserves to be talked about and compared with other great non-fiction epics like Ghandhi, Patton and Lawrence Of Arabia. Reds succeds in taking a complex story and distilling it down to its most essential elements. We care deeply about the relationship between John Reed and Louise Bryant and how they were effected by the upheavel of the revolution. Their journey and their story make for three plus hours of extraordinary cinema. I for one can not wait to see this movie finally make its debut on DVD. This is film-making of the very highest level. Here's a movie that will educate and entertain, without being heavey-handed or pompus. It's been long over-due in my book. Bravo Beatty! This is clearly your masterpiece.
B000GRUS22|4.0|The sixth Enigma album, \\"A Posteriori,\\" is another change in direction for this ambient studio group led by Michael Cretu. Having jettisoned the chanting monks from the previous album, \\"Voyageur,\\" Cretu this time also omits the services of past singers Ruth-Ann and Andru Donalds, as well as, for the very first time, the sensual vocalising from wife Sandra (although there is a new woman named Louisa Stanley who makes a couple of cameo appearances on the disc, and of course Cretu himself still sings on the occasional song). It may take a few listens to fully appreciate (in my case, the third listen was the charm), but \\"A Posteriori\\" ultimately reveals itself as a very entrancing, hypnotic album filled with all the lush, rich ambient textures, sounds and atmospheres of previous Enigma albums. Cretu is still a master studio wizard, and he still weaves an intoxicating tapestry of sound and music. Highlights include the majestic sweep of such tracks as \\"Dreaming Of Andromeda,\\" \\"Dancing With Mephisto,\\" \\"20,000 Miles Over The Sea\\" and \\"Sitting On The Moon.\\" And, as usual, Cretu's production work here is fantastic. Like all Enigma albums, \\"A Posteriori\\" works best late at night with the lights out, as you can lay back comfortably on your bed and just let the album wash over you. Elaborate and powerful, \\"A Posteriori\\" is another excellent offering from Michael Cretu's Enigma.
0800177177|5.0|Well, I was really little at the time it came out(four years old), but I remember seeing a preview for it and asking my father who Dracula was. He told me to wait until I was older. Many years later, having become a Dracula fan(both novel and films), I just recently found the film, and bought it on a whim. WHOA! WOW! What a film! It defintely follows the storyline of Stoker's original novel, with a few added twists and turns that will have you enjoying it from start to finish. Although, there are some particulary graphic violence scenes(Lucy's room getting drenched in blood!) and sexual scenes(Dracula's Brides seducing Harker), it has a wonderful romance brought in. Winona Ryder(Mina Murray Harker/Elisabeta) and Gary Oldman(Dracula) have such great chemistry in the love scenes. I got a little teary at the end. Anthony Hopkins, one of my favorite actors, brings Van Helsing to life in such a sarcastic, serious, humorous, and grave manner. Everyone else in the cast does a stupendous job as well! But what i particularly enjoyed was the way Gary Oldman played the title character. His accent brings to mind that of the european aristocrat with a dark secret, like in all gothic media. He actually based his accent a little bit off Bela Lugosi's. He plays the character with such passion, charm, and rage that you can't help but be hypnotised by his presence onscreen.  Also, you'll notice in the film there are subtle homages to previous films about and inspired Dracula, such as NOSFERATU, DRACULA (1931 film), and Jacques Cocteau's BEAUTY & THE BEAST. If you're a Dracula fan(both novel and films), add Bram Stoker's Dracula to your collection! Bram Stoker himself would love this film!
B000301YY8|5.0|This is a really good album. At first I wasn't so sure whether I liked James Blunt's singing voice, since he sings in falsetto and it seemed too forced, but its grown on me. The strength of the songwriting carries this album. There are only ten songs on the CD, which isn't much, but I have to say every one of them is really good. No mediocre filler songs. I bought this CD after hearing \\"Goodbye My Lover' on the radio, and while I had mixed feelings about his voice, I thought it was a compelling song. I don't think I've ever heard a song describe the intensity of a relationship so well and in such an intimate and truthful way. I think the catchiest track is probably \\"Wisemen\\" which is somewhat reminiscent of Elton John's \\"Tiny Dancer\\". The album does have a kind of depressing quality so that's something to be aware of. Blunt used to be a soldier and has been in war and so he writes about what he's seen, not in a gross way, but in a sad way. Most of the album though is about life and love and strikes me as heartfelt. (On a humorous note, my five year old heard me playing this CD the other day and wanted to know why that man is singing \\"Goodbye My Lava.\\")
B00003CXA4|1.0|I watched this movie and found nothing but bundles of lies. He did his best not to divide India and it was all Jinnah who divided and founded Pakistan.

B000GRTQXY|4.0|I'm not sure what version the other reviewer got, but the one I bought matches the Amazon tracklisting exactly.    As for the music, I found Primal Scream by way of Death in Vegas, which I found by way of the Blair Witch 2 soundtrack... it's a funny web that music weaves. Anyways, I found this CD to be quite a surprise after hearing the singer's vocals on Death in Vegas' \\"Soul Auctioneer\\". I'm still sort of getting a feel for it, but everything I've heard so far, I've liked. Also, reading reviews of their other albums, it seems they change genres a lot, which is a feature I enjoy in bands. So further investigation is required.    EDIT:  The other reviewers are correct. Here's why I was confused:  The actual liner notes with my CD match amazon, and that's where I got that from. The tracks that are physically on the disc though, are different. Here's how mine ends:    10. Sometimes I feel So Lonely  11. Gimme Some Truth  12. Country Girl (live)  13. Suicide Sally and Johnny Guitar (Live at XFM)    Anyways, still a fantastic CD. The only way to listen to it is full blast with your windows rolled down.

B00005R24G|5.0|To deal with that prodigious and proverbial actor named Sir Laurence Olivier is far to be a piece of cake;on the contrary is a big challenge to any actor; and Caine did it without major hindrances. This movie is part of the great tradition of the greatful British literature - nourished by Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie among the most renowned ones - featured by this well known cerebral handle of clues and riddles that challenge the spectator, when a tricked man invites to his wife's lover into a diabolical trap. But the point is who will get the last laugh on whom?<br /><br />A memorable tour de force all the way through.
B000000WJZ|5.0|For me a classic is an album you can listen to 10 years later and still be interested and challenged by it.  Siamese Dream passes that test for me.  It's a rollicking rock album with such a distinctive Pumpkins sound.  I appreciate Billy Corgan's artistic integrity and demand to change and grow their sound, but, IMHO, it never got better than this album.  Mellon Collie was excellent as well, but this is the epitome of the pumpkins' sound. <br /> <br />They had something really special here, it was a magical blending of loads of overdubbed guitars, lazy bends, superb drumming, angsty/angry lyrics, and a gentle finish.   My favorites are Cherub Rock, Rocket, Geek USA, Mayonaise, Soma, Disarm, Silverf**k, oh the whole darn album is great. <br /> <br />If you like great hard rock music, but with melody and meaning, this is a classic album.  Truly amazing!  I'm loving it all over again, 10+ years later.
6305428387|5.0|`Cool Runnings' is one of those movies I can watch over and over again and never get sick of it.  Based on a true story that is both touching and inspirational, Jon Turteltaub does a magnificent job of infusing enough humor and wit into this script to make it one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen.  The story is about a young group of Jamaicans who are vying for a way to the Olympics.  Derice Bannock (Leon) has dreamed of running in the Olympics all his life.  His father was a famous Olympic runner and he dreamed of doing the same.  Junior Bevil (Lewis) lives under the strict watch of his wealthy father who humors Junior's fantasy about running in the Olympics but doesn't wholeheartedly support it.  And then we have Yul Brenner (Yoba) who lacks a good education but makes up for that with brute strength and arrogance.  On the day of the tryouts Junior takes a fall and trips up Yul and Derice ending all of their chances to make it to the Olympics. <br /> <br />That is until they meet Irving Blitzer (Candy), an ex-bobsledder who knew Derice's father when they were in the Olympics together.  Irving had always believed that runners would make the best Bobsled team and now he had the opportunity to try that out.  With the help of Sanka Coffie (Doug E. Doug) they form the first Jamaican Bobsled team and head off to Canada to compete.   <br /> <br />They are met with serious scrutiny, not only because they are Jamaican but also because their coach, Irv, is hated among the Olympic community.  Irving was disqualified back in his Olympic days for hiding weights in the front of a sled to make it go faster, thus disqualifying, and humiliating his country, his teammates and his coach.  Thus, they don't like him very much and because of that the Jamaicans have to work extra hard to make an impression.  The film has plenty of funny scenes but it also has plenty of heart and by the end of the movie you'll be wiping away the tears and pushing through with a smile.  They don't make many movies like this one, so when they do we need to grab them and never let go.  `Cool Runnings' is definitely a one of a kind film, a film that's entertaining and suitable for the whole family, and one that any DVD library would be incomplete without!
B0007PAMR4|1.0|DON'T BE FOOLED!!!!  The page states that David Lynch directed this, but he actually took his name off (look at the screen shot).  This extended edition was directed by Alan Smithee.  Don't worry though . . . it gets worse. <br /> <br />I don't normally write reviews, but I feel compelled to in this case, so here it goes. <br /> <br />First off, I loved the books and David Lynch's interpretation in the theatrical release.   <br /> <br />That being said, this is just aweful.  I totally agree with those who have stated that this is an abomination.  Cons include, but are not limited to: <br /> <br />Good scenes cut from the theatrical <br />Bad voice over with storyboards for much of the 'extra footage' <br />Uneven quality and clumsy transitions to new material <br />The list goes on. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and don't spend the money on this.  Just get the theatrical release and be happy.  If you didn't like David Lynch's interpretation, then just take the time and pleasure to read the book again. <br /> <br />I can't believe they actually released this.  I totally understand David Lynch taking his name off of this. <br /> <br />-Sincerely, <br />-J
B000GFLAI0|1.0|BD sounds like Dave van Ronk or Joe Cocker on a couple of tracks and like Van the Man on others. Haunting gitarr riffs along with BD's great lyrics all makes for a set of songs that will just add to the genius that is BD.

B000GG4XHO|4.0|I bought this new version because of the great job Buddah Records did a few years back with Rock and Roll Heart and The Bells in remastering. I was hoping for more of the same from RCA/Legacy but it's not quite as good.   <br />  Whereas on those albums you can clearly hear every intricant sound in it's full glory (sounds are present on the Buddah releases that you can't hear on the originals that will just blow you away), the only thing I really noticed is that the overall sound level is higher and the sound more crisp.  That may be in part that more care was taken in the original RCA release (Rock and Roll Heart and The Bells were released on Arista)and not much left to be improved upon.  What I don't like is the high end hiss is still clearly audible (especially noticable on Coney Island Baby) but that may be from the original recording. <br />  The bonus tracks are well worth the reinvestment though.  Yes, three were on Between Thought and Expression but there is some improvement on those.  The bonus version of She's my Best Friend is absolutely killer. <br />  All in all a great disc and nice packaging make this well worth the money.
B000EPFVCS|4.0|Imagine a world of the future in which nanotechnology has run amuck and destroyed the earth. Humanity is now divided into two camps. On the one hand you have those who distrust advanced technology and want to guard what's left of the solar system. They are called the Threshers/ One the other, you have those who have embraced technology with the mindset that what is done is done and it makes no sense to abandon all the benefits it can bring. These would be the Slashers. The two groups are at loggerheads with each other but the Slashers have the technological edge but the Threshers have the earth. <br /> <br />Within these groups, there are varying shades. Some of the Slashers are eager to go to war again and try to recreate a world of their own choosing. Some of the Threshers don't want to work with Slashers under any circumstance.  <br /> <br />The Slashers base much of their technology upon the remnants of a vanished civilization. This technology gives access to the rest of the galaxy but the understanding is imperfect at best. Like much of Reynold's work, there is a Goth feel to it. <br /> <br />Now, with tensions getting higher, the Threshers have access to a wormhole portal on the Martian moon, Phobos. The place the wormhole comes out turns out to be a BIG surprise. It comes out on earth. More specifically, it comes out in Paris in 1959 but this is not OUR Paris. In this world, WWII never happened. It was nipped in the bud with the German advance into France was stalled. It is a noir world right out of Mickey Spilane. Its as if a copy of earth was made in 1940, perfect in every detail, and then that world was left to develop on its own way. <br /> <br />The Threshers are excited about this find. They hope to fill in large gaps in their own forgotten history. The problem is that one of their teams has been killed. She has uncovered a big plot. The Slashers do know about the place and they have a terrible plan in place. <br /> <br />Humanity's only chance lies inthe efforts of a Thresher archeologist and a private detective from the Alternate Paris. <br /> <br />It's an interesting and exciting story. There are a few ends which are left a little looser than I would have liked but it is a good read. The two main characters do not wind up together as one would expect but...they'll always have Paris. <br />
B00004LN16|4.0|Don't believe some of these negative, cynical reviews. Stiff Upper Lip is the real deal, and was AC/DC's return to the original formula: straight-no-chaser, blues based hard rock, with an emphasis on catchy grooves and riffs. The production (Producer/ brother George Young & engineer Mike Fraser) is the absolute best on an AC/DC record since \\"For Those About To Rock\\"-and captures the band how they should sound, clear and crisp, but retains that \\"live\\" feel, it's an analog recording so it's got that warm, vintage sound. Now as far as the songs go, as a long time fan of this band, I believe this to be their best batch of tracks, since the legendary \\"Back In Black\\" album. Out of the 12 tunes, only \\"House Of Jazz\\" dosen't work for me. Favorites and highlights include the smokin' title track, \\"Satellite Blues\\", \\"Meltdown\\", \\"Safe In New York City\\" and \\"Give It Up\\". Even the predictable \\"Can't Stop Rock & Roll\\" is a blast. You can tell the band was having fun recording this. Of course, the whole group plays their heart out, Brian Johnson sings 'n' swaggers up a storm, but I must point out how good Phil Rudd's drums sound here, his chops are still solid, a welcome reminder of the man's talent, in the \\"less is more\\" style of AC/DC Rock & Roll. This cd has restored my faith in no-frills Hard Rock. To sum up, this is a CLASSIC AC/DC album...one of the band's best.   Give it a chance...rock out.
0895260131|5.0|This book obliterates simplistic, politically correct views about Islam.  The word-for-word comparisons between the teachings of Muhammed and the teachings of Christianity, Buddhism, and other religions, are stunning.  Take, for example, the famous story of Jesus' intervention when a crowd was about to stone an adulterous woman.  His words, to let the person \\"who is without sin cast the first stone\\", sent the mob retreating in shame.  He then told the woman to, \\"Go and sin no more.\\"  As the autor quotes from the Quran, Muhammed was confronted with a similar situation.  A pregnant adulterous woman had come to him requesting that he pray with her for forgiveness.  He sent her away until the baby was born.  When she came back months later, he sent her away until the child was weened.  When she came back as directed, he took the child and gave it to one of his men as a gift.  Muhammed then ordered the mother buried up to her shoulders and stoned to death.  It really is time for media pundits, college professors, and self-serving politicos to stop making shallow moral equivalence statements about Islam, the Quran, and the Crusades.  This book needs to be read and studied by those who now are in a position to give away our birthright.  It took the ancient Greeks, the Judeo-Christian tradition, the Magna Carta, the U.S. Constitution, and hundreds of years of Western Civilization to produce the most beneficent and free society in history.  Here, Muslims and others can practice their beliefs without fear.  We must insist that spokesmen and apologists for Islam demand that this \\"religion of peace\\" grant its neighbors the same rights the Western democracies have gladly given to them.  Read the book.  Its an eye-opener.
B000G759LW|5.0|Again, Christina shows me why she is one of the best vocalists in the industry. If you loved her other albums, then you will love this one! Great Buy!
B000G7PMD2|1.0|What happened to Dream Theater? Why does the band feel the need to put out live material after every studio recording. There isn't that much new material to cover. Try waiting a few albums between live recordings. Not to mention the songs on Octavarium are pretty mediocre. Do we really need to pay for them twice? Of course if the gullible fans didn't buy every live album and DVD that was released DT wouldn't put them out. DT simply has become a cash cow taking advantage of it's loyal fans (myself included) who buy every little scrap they throw together.  <br /> <br />Has anyone noticed John Myung doesn't care anymore? That the newer material I am supposed to be so excited to hear on this live album has been haphazardly thrown together in between side projects? Petrucci and Portnoy (aka the puppetmasters) should bow down to every fan who has stuck with them through their overtly commercial raping of those who put them at the top of the genre. DT can blow me until they \\"take the time\\" to write a decent album to tour behind... then I will buy the Live Album/DVD/Knife Sharpener/Officially Licensed Soap/......
1932907009|5.0|This is one of the few books out there, including Syd Field's, that give you a clear direction for writing your screenplay. No pontificating about \\"the loss of story,\\" just real practical tools and examples that take you from concept, through logline to a finished script.  <br /> <br />As for the reviewers who have said he's \\"hack\\" or that \\"Stop of my Mom Will Shoot,\\" is a bad movie first let me say, HE'S GETTING PAID FOR HIS WRITING AND YOU'RE NOT! You can walk around as smug as you like. Producers don't want to read scripts. They'll find any reason not to, so you better have a really good concept before they'll even pick it up. And what Blake wrote, and how the script was executed are two different things (Blake writes about \\"Actor Archetypes\\" and with that notion, the film was miscast. Has Stallone EVER made a successful comedy? And Estelle Getty in a movie? Who would pay to see her and whose idea was that?) And the comment that this book focuses on \\"Comedy\\" couldn't be further from the truth. It is his area of familiarity, but the tools apply to any genre.  <br /> <br />If you're one of those artsy fartsy holier than thou type filmmakers looking to make smaller, personal films that screw around with narrative structure (and there's nothing wrong with that, you just have to go out of your way to find them) then this book probably is NOT for you. As another reviewer stated, he's not talking about Art here. But if you're interested in what works and what is saleable in the Hollywood arena of films being made and seen by the public, then pick it up. This is an honest book of what makes a marketable script from someone who is there. <br /> <br />And if you have the opportunity to take his workshop (which is a HELLUVA lot cheaper than other unproduced screenwriting \\"gurus\\" who haven't sold a thing, the class is limited to 10 so you get personal one on one attention AND you get to write and apply his tools), even better. He's a GREAT guy. Funny, open, friendly, encouraging and approachable during and after you're done with his class.
1400049628|5.0|For a book without jokes, it's amazingly funny. Why? It's difficult to explain to people why this book is so good. I try to tell my friends/coworkers/family why they must read this book, but I can't properly convey exactly WHY it's funny.<br /><br />I think back to an episode of Paleoworld (or some such show about dinosaurs) that I saw hosted by Leslie Nealson (Airplane, Naked Gun, Etc...). He was completely serious the whole time but I couldn't help chuckling.<br /><br />This book is serious and detailed in its delivery. It covers every conceivable angle of zombieness from creation to destruction straight faced.<br /><br />Trust me when I say you'll love this book.
B000GG4XHO|5.0|Great sound, and the 6 bonus tracks are really quite terrific -- 3 of them were available on his box set or as a b-side or on comps, and those are tremendous. Then there are 3 others that were never before available and they're unbelievable, too!  <br /> <br />I don't know how this snuck into the CD store, but it's a definite must-have for Reed fans, and it's one of his best solo efforts if you're just getting into him.
B000002UAU|5.0|How can I do this album justice? I was ten years old when I bought my copy and since then I've probably listened to it hundreds of times. To my ears, it still sounds fresh. It still captivates me. It remains a very special place for me to go. It's had a profound influence on me as a songwriter. I adored the Fab Four before the release of \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" but when they began to collaborate more with the 'fifth Beatle'- producer George Martin, they took rock and pop to new heights- a brave new world as it were. From the beginning sounds of an orchestra warming up amid a crowd of people murmuring (on the title track) to the final sounds on the album which consist of 1) the sound of an orchestra playing their instruments from their respective lowest notes to their highest notes and resembling something like the sound of Heaven exploding; 2) the sound of all four Beatles pounding the same chord on four different pianos simultaneously (both from \\"A Day In The Life\\"; to 3) the odd loop at the very end which one can hear much better on the CD than one ever could on the vinyl version, this album turned pop music upside down and inside out.<br /><br />On \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" you get the 'basic' rock/pop songs your growing body needs such as the intro and reprise of \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\", the classic \\"With A  Little Help From My Friends\\" lead-sung by Ringo, Paul's \\"Getting Better\\" (though John contributed the great \\"it couldn't get much worse\\" line to balance things out), Paul's \\"Fixing A Hole\\" and \\"Lovely Rita\\" (with its weird vocalizations at the end) and John's \\"Good Morning Good Morning\\" which was inspired by a TV commercial selling cereal. I grouped these tunes together because they're the least psychedelic songs on the album for the most part. For mental growth through mind expansion, the Beatles give us the lovely John-penned \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\" which was inspired by a colorful drawing his first son Julian created. The Fabs have repeatedly denied it has anything to do with LSD. We'll leave it at that. Paul's very touching string-quartet melodrama \\"She's Leaving Home\\" is complete with gorgeous harmonies by John and George. John's \\"Being For The Benefit of Mr. Kite!\\" is one of the most psychedelic songs on the album. What makes this track so awesome is the cut up then looped tapes of calliopes playing in which the Beatles, George Martin and associates of the band all participated in the initial cutting. Mr. Martin is the one that did the final editing of these random sounds and they fit perfectly into the song. It was an astonishing feat especially considering the primitive technology of the time. Listening to this track is like being on acid at a carnival. I just love it! George's underappreciated meditation on universal love, \\"Within You Without You\\" comes next. George Martin's string arrangement beautifully compliments the basic sitar & tabla arrangement. My least favorite song on \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" is Paul's music hall-derived \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\" and though it's my least favorite, I still dig it- especially the very clever lyrics. Paul would go on to compose more songs in this style with each of them annoying me more and more. \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" from \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" and \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" from \\"Abbey Road\\" are cut from the same cloth as \\"Sixty-Four\\" but don't work half as well as the original.<br /><br />The album closes with what may be the Beatles' most incredible piece of music- the one-of-a-kind \\"A Day In The Life\\". John begins the song (it's mostly his composition) and Paul wrote and sings the middle part that begins \\"woke up, fell out of bed...\\".  The unique, soaring orchestral part in the middle and at the end of the song was Paul's idea. George Martin has stated that John's vocals on this song are quite possibly his best. I love how vulnerable he sounds when singing \\"I'd love to turn you on'. Some folks may quibble about the sequencing of this album but \\"A Day In The Life\\" unarguably belongs where it is, as the most amazing 'encore' ever recorded.<br /><br />On a personal note, one of my own albums titled \\"The Last Hurrah\\" (email me and I'll send a sampler of it) from 1990 was tremendously influenced by \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\". It was also inspired by \\"The Velvet Underground & Nico\\". How's that for an interesting mix?<br /><br />Turn on to Sgt. Pepper's\\" today- they'd love to turn you on!unarguably belongs where it is, as the most amazing 'encore' ever recorded. <br /> <br />On a personal note, one of my own albums titled \\"The Last Hurrah\\" (email me and I'll send a sampler of it) from 1990 was tremendously influenced by \\"Sgt.
