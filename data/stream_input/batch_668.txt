B000N6TX1I|4.0|Based on the novel by P.D. James. In the year 2027, humanity has become infertile and the youngest person on earth is 18 years old. An ex-activist named Theo (Clive Owen) is kidnapped one day by a rebel group led by his ex-girlfriend Julian (Julianne Moore). Theo will learn that a refugee woman is 8 months pregnant. She is the first woman in 18 years to be pregnant. The group needs Theo's help to bring the woman safely to a secret group called the Human Project. In order to get to them, they have to reach a boat, the Tomorrow, while it passes at specific scheduled stops. Betrayal, death, and hope will fill their journey to a better and fertile future.<br /><br />The story of Children of Men takes place in a frightening landscape of fear, propaganda, ravaged cities, and urban warfare. Alfonso Cuaron (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Y Tu Mama Tambien) masterfully directs this post-apocalyptic thriller. The filters he uses set the tone for this cold and dark film. Stunning cinematography conveys the bleak picture and desperate ways of the times ahead. The sudden bursts of action and violence pull you right in the middle of this intense story. Owen gives a near perfect performance, playing the role of Theo with just the right amount of disillusionment, sorrow, humor, and charm. Julianne Moore's appearance was brief but strong. Michael Caine provides the much needed comic relief of the film as Theo's old friend. The brilliant screenplay always kept its focus and never fell heavily into the political aspect of things (which could've dragged the movie down) and keeps a steady pace of action, surprises, and character development.<br /><br />Children of Men is at once a sad and beautiful film. It shows you what humanity is willing (or unwilling) to do when it finds itself doomed. Mankind's demise doesn't come as a cataclysm that wipes out the planet, but more as a slow killer in the form of the inability for humans to reproduce themselves and insure their lineage with future generations. Sit back and brace yourselves; this film is better and has more backbone than most big budget films you'll find in this day and age.ations. Sit back and brace yourselves; this film is better and has more backbone than most big budget films you'll find in this day and age.
B000MM1F5A|5.0|This is an excellent package...this is Mariza at her best..her vocals are emotional and captivating, and the bonus DVD documentary about the Story of Fado is so very informative and entertaining at the same time, including not only live footage of Mariza and her contemporaries, but also rare live footage of the doyenne of the genre, Amalia Rodrigues. That said, I am particularly peeved by the comments of your reviewer, D.Parr \\"dtakoma\\" who says that the CD could not be downloaded on his MP3 player and calls it a \\"crime\\". Mr. Parr, I just downloaded my CD onto my \\"IPod\\" with no trouble at all. Perhaps your player is faulty, or you may have an import copy from Europe or a \\"bootleg\\"? The true \\"crime\\" is in misleading people!!!

B0002X314C|4.0|Very good album. Never get tired of it. Looking forward to getting his new one as well.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|i really enjoyed this box set.  I am an avid fan and loved the way that this series built and in particular the developing bond between the two brothers.  The English box set did not come with the added bonuses so I purchased it from America where I enjoyed the added footage.   <br /> <br />I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a little horror - complete with two sexy guys who work and interact well together - along with Urban Legends which seem to be popular.  This series has everything in it.  I have not enjoyed a series so much since I was a child. I hope it goes for a good few seasons as I am enjoying season two at the present time. <br /> <br />
B0001BDAQO|5.0|Bach's works translate so well in other mediums. I have heard his stuff transcribed for harmonica to kazoo...and it always sounds fresh and as if it were meant for that specific media. These jazz transcription are \\"spot on\\" and the Telarc sound is once again, exemplary!
B00005JA2B|5.0|Like I said before.The 70's had great music.This cd is excellent.I have'nt heard the album in a long time since I had it in cassette.This is better.I love the sound.The reissue is great with lyrics and pictures.The bonus tracks are outstanding.Looking forward getting more Kansas reissues(As well as Heart).
B0002TKFRM|5.0|How can something older than me sound so good? The recording is top notch. Dont be fooled into thinking it is \\"just stereo\\", the ambience of symphony hall comes thru as though it were recorded in surround. Exquisite detail and perfect tempo. Timpani has realistic impact. And all the other music with Pictures makes this a real bargain!
B0007VZ9DK|5.0|Great performances by all-star cast. Martin Scorsese shows why he's the best action director in the business. Diniro, Sharon Stone and James Woods are the imperfect love triangle. And Pesci is Pesci. Must see mob movie.

B000GRUMPU|2.0|The expectations for this film were high- a good cast and a promise of a remake of an old movie using today's technology. <br /> <br />Alas- the movie was disappointing. The characters were not developed and the were quite flat.  The action starts very soon in the movie (the wave striking the ship) and thus there was no opportunity for them to develop.  The course of the movie did not allow for any significant development. <br />Moreover, the special affects and all the action are not very well tied together or simply not believable. For example all the surviving passangers, including a young kid prove to be record swimmers that can hold their breath for a long period. <br /> <br />It is a pity as if the script was a bit better and more developed the film could have been enjoyable. <br />

0439813786|5.0|Most of the reviews have described this book in great detail, so I'll skip that. I picked up this book with the intent of giving as a gift to an adult friend. I ended up reading it to my six-year old daughter. It is the perfect start for transitioning from picture books with little vocabulary to chapter books without pictures. At six, she still wants to pictures to reinforce the visuals she's building. At the recommendation of teachers and librarians, I want to start expanding her vocabulary through what we read together. I wish there were more books of this kind available for kids and families to read together.
B000001GRE|5.0|I think that this a very good Mahler 7th - one that would have been even better, if Boulez had relaxed a bit more in the two Nachtmusik movements. Boulez clocks in around 14 minutes for the first Nachtmusik, and well less than 11 minutes in the second one! That's fast, folks. But on the other side of the equation, Boulez's 23 minute first movement makes it easier to follow and digest Mahler's complex polyphony and thoroughly modern harmonies. Combined with textures that are more chamber like than usual (Boulez was greatly influenced by Hans Rosbaud in this work), it makes for a seventh Mahler that's not only devoid of excess sentiment, but shifts the work into the upper pantheon of great 20th century works. By the way, Boulez's 17:45 timing for the finale is pretty much exactly the same as Bernstein (Sony); Levine/CSO; Abbado/CSO; Ozawa/BSO, and Haitink (1969). But I find that Boulez's somewhat lighter textures help in making the finale seem more light hearted than usual - not a bi-product one would expect from the allegedly \\"cold\\" Pierre Boulez. This is a serious competitor among single disc versions of the Mahler 7th.
B0000C16OQ|5.0|<br />The complete Grease experience. This cd is a two disc-set with disc one being the complete soundtrack, while disc two is all bonus material including the popular Grease Megamix. Fans of the movie would want to make this cd an essential part of their music collection.
B000J103YI|5.0|If you love musicals or R&B, you will love this CD.  Every song from the Dreamgirls, the Movie is on this.  Love it.
B00000JFV9|5.0|Its amazing that this 35 year old sound track still resonates to todays modern living, the lyrics have as much impact as it did then. Eventhough Mr. Mayfield sings and preaches of a terrible condition this record leaves you feeling good to know that you havebeen exposed to such a great piece of work. What I also found to be interesting is that this form of music is not lost you can find this present day street knowledge in the sounds of some the Neo soul artist music. They have been able to transend this into a down to the bone funky back beat that borrows from hip hop, jazz and r&b so seek and ye shall find the message still being preached.
0930289234|5.0|Like everyone else who reads this story (\\"comic\\" falls badly short) I cannot stop singing its praises. There are so many layers of meaning, so many plots, so few \\"comic tropes\\", and generally so many things to laud that I simply can't do it concisely. Suffice to say, those who complain that this book ain't so great are missing something. It's important to remember that before Watchmen, no one had told story this complex and mature through the comic book medium. Precious few have done so since, and it remains a pinnacle of achievment in the genre- as well as a reminder of why, V for Vendetta and other missteps aside, Alan Moore is such a tower figure in comics today.
B000EQ5SRK|5.0|What a great movie!  Erotic and scary at the same time.  Talk about the ultimate in voyeuristic tendencies.  This film has it.  The ending will totally surprise you, though.  It did me.
B000002P72|5.0|As a Memphis native, I have heard B.B. on many occasions. Never have I seen or hear him play with the same passion he did here in 1964. The quality of the recording is outstanding, with Lucille giving the center-stage on many occasions. The clarity and quality is amazing for a forty year old recording. This is the live B.B. King recording to buy. The Cook County Jail performance from 1971 is a close second, but the quality is not nearly as good.
0307237699|3.0|I was not a bit surprised by the content of this book and probably would not have chosen to read it if it weren't my book club's pick. All were agreed that it was a lot of nice stuff, and he seems like a really great guy but that we would have had more respect for him as a presidential candidate if he had taken a perhaps controversial stand on something. We all felt like he seems like the kind of person we'd like to have in our circle of friends, but we got nothing that compells us to run out and vote for him. We were all a bit puzzled by the word \\"Audacity\\" in the title. There was nothing that smacked of audacity here.
B000N3SS80|5.0|I have been a fan of Jennifer for many years now. I got all her albums and seen almost all her movies. When I heard she was coming out with a spanish album I was sooooo happy because I have heard songs here and there she has done by herself and with Marc. I was so impatient I wanted it out right away..LOL. Finally, I listen to it fully in my car and I was sooooooo impressed by how much she has improved. I so can relate to every word that is sang on this album. The best thing I like about Jennifer is that in her past albums she sang sometimes about love but this album show cases it totally. She puts meaning into every song. I love that of her. Also the booklet is so beautiful. She always takes beautiful photos. If you love, love songs in spanish this album is for you!
0393327655|2.0|I am, what I would consider, a moderately religious person. Apparantly I am much more dangerous to the world than your average bomb-toting terrorist. I really tried to keep an open mind and see his point of view while reading this. I think I would have had a better shot at that if I wasn't feeling personally attacked again and again. Those of us who wish to embrace tolerance and live an example of peaceful coexistance to our children are worse than fanatical fundamentalists. According to Mr. Harris tolerence is the wrong path to peace.
0312323867|5.0|A really enjoyable book.  This is the follow on from Something Borrowed.  Darcy is pregnant and has been \\"dumped\\" by all her friends.  Darcy is obssessed with Rachael  and Dex (her ex fiancee and ex best friend who are now in a happy relationship with each other.) Darcy decides to escape to England and stay with her schoolfriend, Ethan.  This is well written and good fun.  Does Darcy see the errors of her selfish, self centred \\"all about me ways?\\"   You need to read it to find out but this is a book worth reading.   The title of this review may give you a little hint. Great stuff!
1416911049|3.0|I love to read young adult books- some are so brave and they address issues adult books haven't gotten around to yet.  This is that kind of book.  The set-up, the world created, is great-very imaginative.  There are some problems though.  Tally is beyond innocent at the beginning of the book- she is...well...kind of stupid and annoying. Also, the plot went the way I expected.  All this might mean that I would rate the book lower.  However, Tally does slowly get a bit better character-wise.  In addition, the well created and imagined world in which the book takes places deserves revisiting.  Therefore, I would recommend the book with some reservation, while I myself will move on to reading Pretties.
1593080255|4.0|Wilde's literary genious is evident throughout.  It is written in a very cinematic style - quite visual and rich in detail. Drinched in symbolism and societal insights, you feel as though you are a painting yourself watching the story unfold - - - You can almost smell the musty English drapes, see the grandiose rooms with chairs so thick with dust that a poof rises gently in the air when you sit upon them. Thought provoking and grim.  Masterful
B000LC55F2|5.0|It was great to see Bale and Jackman work together.  They both did an excellent job.  Michael Caine is always superb.  And how can you go wrong with Christopher Nolan?  Check this one out!
B00005JPMX|3.0|After the defeat of nemesis Shredder, the Turtles have split up. Leader Leonardo (James Arnold Kelly) now resides in South America by orders of Master Splinter (Mako), Donatello (Mitchell Whitfield) is tech help, Michaelangelo (Mikey Kelly) entertains youngsters as Cowabunga Carl, and Raphael (Nolan North) defends New York under the identity of Nightwalker. Struggling to keep them together, their rat sensei, Master Splinter (Mako), becomes worried when strange things begin to brew in New York City. Tech-industrialist Max Winters (Patrick Stewart) is raising up an army of ancient, 3,000-year-old monsters to take over New York. The Turtles are now needed more than ever, and with a little pep-talk from Casey Jones (Chris Evans) and April O'Neil (Sarah Michelle Gellar), the Turtles must put any beef behind them and focus on more pressing matters.    With comic books being converted into movies by the dozen, feel free to add \\"TMNT\\" to the list. That's right, the heroes in a half shell have come back after a 14 year absence, thanks to Kevin Monroe, director of some video game called \\"Freaky Flyers\\", who ALMOST gets it right.    In this installment, Munroe ditches the light tone of the live-action films and goes for a grittier tone a la \\"Batman Begins\\". This change of pace is one of this movie's many strengths, but also its many weakness. The good is that Munroe adds a subplot that has Leonardo and Raphael at each others throats. What could've been annoying fodder is actually compelling and powerful, thanks to James Arnold Taylor (\\"Drawn Together\\" as the voice of Wooldor Sockbat) and Nolan North's (\\"Ultimate Avengers\\" as Hank Pym/Giant Man) sharp line readings. And how can you go wrong with a scene where the two Turtles vent their emotions during heavy downpour? That scene is where we get to see Munroe's surprisingly sharp editing skills in action.    Unfortunately, it's also the film's weakness. I applaud Munroe for sticking to the comic book origins, but he seems to be at a tug-of-war between scenes of conflict and scenes where Michaelangelo and Donatello - reduced to cameos - crack jokes. Anytime the latter happens, it doesn't have the correct effect to make us laugh. You can tell Munroe is trying to match the original movies' upbeat nature by throwing in driving rock-and-roll tunes in various scenes (such as Jet's \\"Rip it Up\\", Big Rock City's update on the Ram Jam classic \\"Black Betty\\", and more), yet it doesn't meld well when dealing with darker situations.    Munroe has also added newcomers to the cast. Mako, who recently died this year, gives his last, and most memorable performance as Zen Master Splinter. Chris Evans delivers a funny performance as hockey-loving crimefighter Casey Jones. Patrick Stewart makes his villainous character believable without being overly loathsome. There's even a brief cameo by director Kevin Smith that gets some much needed laughs in a scene where Raphael battles a monster in the kitchen, and Smith's chef character believes that he's being robbed. Finally, Larry Fishburne reads the opening narration with total conviction. All actors benefit.    The only weak spot in the cast, which is a shock to me, is Sarah Michelle Gellar. Annoying squeaky voice aside, Gellar is another star whose gifted comic timing (see her 2002 episode of \\"Saturday Night Live\\") isn't used to full potential. Rather, she seems to be stepping back into her days of being on \\"Buffy: The Vampire Slaye\\"r, where her take on April O'Neil has mastered martial arts. In the movie adaptation of \\"Scooby Doo\\", Sarah was able to take this subplot and be funny at the same time. In \\"TMNT\\", it's taken too seriously, robbing her chances to take advantage of the material. And when she's in a scene of comedy, it feels awkward.    All that aside. \\"TMNT\\" is an entertaining film, and a rebirth of a franchise that may see the light of day again considering how the movie ends. Let's just hope Munroe can get the franchise back to its light-hearted spoofagenda if that ever happens.
0800141849|3.0|This is kind of like a Howard Hawkes movie.  You'll enjoy it more if you spend less time worrying about how the story unfolds and instead just delight in the performances of the actors.  Lauren Bacall is such a treat.  Streisand playing against the all-star cast is fun stuff.  Unfortunately, Jeff Bridges is in completely over his head.  He's awful (but then he always is).  The fact that there's no real chemistry between him and Streisand really hurts the movie because there's no simmer between the two.  The ending is really killed by the lack of chemistry.  Bridges looks as if he's being forced to kiss an aunt with a mustache and Streisand appears to be replused by his presence.  I guess like Hawkes, Streisand doesn't like to reuse a pretty face.  That's too bad because just about any of her previous leading men would have improved this otherwise entertaining film.
B000JLTRIG|4.0|I was pleased with is product. It arrived on time, I saw a couple of episodes of this series and after a couple I was hooked.
076113719X|5.0|This is one of the best calendars out there if you have a busy family. We all like being able to see at a glance who will be doing what on any given day, and it makes scheduling for the family at a glance much easier. This is a calendar that I have gotten year after year sense getting it as a gift the first time around. I also enjoy that it begins the \\"year\\" by the school year (beginning in Aug. I believe it was) - not January to January like many calendars out there, so you actually can get a full years use out of it instead of having to switch out calendars during the holiday season when there are already a ton of things going on. <br />
0553588486|3.0|The first thing that needs to be said about this book is that it is both good and bad.  It is light reading, has it's trashy parts, but it is also highly absorbing. In case the other reviews don't make it clear enough, this is a BLOODY book. A Fantasy novel for adults should be violent, they don't call it \\"Sword-and-Sorcery\\" for nothing--emphasis on the sword, in this case. Read more about the nature of the ugliness below, but if you don't like violence and general grotesque behavior, consider yourself warned.<br /><br />So what's good?  The INTRIGUE!!!  That is what makes this book the most different, in my view.  It's not a hero quest with some boring, big-eyed Everyman searching for the one way to save the world.  This book is 50 different people, all interconnected, all struggling with the events that each other's actions bring about.  It tracks murder mysteries, political coups, power plays and all that good stuff, and that aspect is FUN.  The title really describes it, \\"A GAME of Thrones.\\"  The technique of having a different character's viewpoint for each chapter is very engrossing and gives the reader the chance to think things over for him- or herself, seeing each situation through the eyes of different participants allows one to draw one's own conclusions about what is happening or who a person really is.<br /><br />And yes, he kills off Main Characters--more than one, good guys and bad.  That part can be hard to take, because one sometimes can't help but get attatched, and I will miss certain people in the following books. But it also makes it more interesting, and because of the way it is written, one can often spot the oncoming event and prepare.<br /><br />And what is bad? Well, the writing is not all that sophisticated, and it isn't the author's mastery of language that drives the book.  Much has been made of the \\"gritty\\",\\"real\\" characters who are not \\"black and white\\", and I totally disagree, all the actual main characters have a firm orientation towards good or evil.<br /><br />There wasn't anything that happened to the humans in this book that I found overly shocking--incest, infanticide, rape, torture--because let's face it, the author gets a kick out of throwing the most awful stuff into the reader's face, thinks he's making an \\"impact\\", thinks it's, well, ENTERTAINMENT.  That's the main trashy aspect of the book.  It's just too over-the-top to really be shocking.  Character A is not only a bad dude, he also shags his sister and murders children! A barbarian festival is not complete without several fights to the death and then an orgy in the blood!..Get it? Also, since the whole thing is so violent, he has to up the stakes when he wants violence to make a point or an impact and that gets wearing.<br /><br />***The parts that bothered me were the SEVERAL incidences of CRUELTY TO ANIMALS. I don't really care what he does to his humans, since he makes it obvious from the start that he's all about the bloodlust, but the cruelty to animals is the MOST gratuitous of all of George R.R. Martin's gratuitous violence.  I would like to read the books further, but I hesitate at the thought of being ambushed by paragraphs on executing puppies.***<br /><br />So if you want an absorbing diversion from our everyday world, this is one.  Although it is a long-looking book, it is actually very quick reading and will last you just long enough.  It's not gonna make you think about the Big Questions, or give you insight into The Nature of Man, but if you can handle the blood, guts, twisted morality and deviant behavior, it will entertain you.

B00000F169|5.0|Knowing it was a glorified student film before I watched it, my expectations for Dark Star weren't very high. However, I was surprised by the script and subtle humor in the movie, and the small details and creative moviemaking used to make up for the low budget. <br /> <br />It wasn't a perfect movie, but its freshness and creativity make up for its flaws. Obviously Carpenter, O'Bannon, etc., all went on to have great careers, and made some great movies. <br /> <br />If you like \\"first movies\\", sci-fi, fantasy, horror, or any of the other work put out by the people involved in this movie, you should end up liking Dark Star. I thought it was great.
075640407X|5.0|By far the best fantasy book I've read in a while.  <br /> <br />Kvothe is one the most real, imperfect and relatable fantasy heroes you will ever have the pleasure of reading about, and the rest of the characters (with the exception of Ambrose, who is a little too stereotypical for my taste) are just as good. <br /> <br />The setting is also very well done. The world we're introduced to is more conservative than most fantasy worlds, there are no elves or dwarves, but they aren't necessary as it turns out. What is distinct about it is the lore. It is a world complete with gods and demons, myths surrounding them, holidays and celebrations revolving around them, people who believe in them and people who don't, all of them making the world feel much more real than many other comparable endeavors. The magic \\"system\\" is also very unique and detailed, a little hard to understand in some cases, but that makes sense because its supposed to be a hard thing to learn, hence its an even harder thing for Kvothe to explain as he tells his story. <br /> <br />What really brings it home is the writing. It is verbose and concise in all the right places, suspenseful (to the point where you have to exert a considerable amount of effort to keep yourself from skipping down the page  to find out what happened), and funny.  <br /> <br />The only real downside is that its only part one, and the rest of the series isn't even on the horizon yet. I finished reading a week ago, and I'm still going through withdrawal, so be careful.  <br /> <br />However, in all seriousness, if you ever found a fantasy book enjoyable, chances are you will like this one. So buy it, you wont be sorry.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|Eric Clapton did a fabulous job in organizing a rare collection of guitar talent to perform at this three-day festival in Texas. It is as much a treat to see the legendary bluesmen Buddy Guy and B.B. King onstage with Eric, as it is to see fret-shreddin' Steve Vai, Jimmy Vaughn and Johnny Lang.<br /><br />The music is blues-based, but many different styles and flavors are present: old-style blues, cultural (Indian), jazz, blues-rock and rock. Although there were time considerations in editing the footage of this CD, the \\"best of the best\\" is represented here.<br /><br />One of the key highlights of this show is Robert Randolph, a new Jersey native, who played the pedal steel guitar in a cross between the styles of Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan. I have never seen anything like it and he clearly made his mark in this performance, appearing onstage several times.<br /><br />Some of the tunes were inspirational enough to pick up the guitar, turn on the amp and play along, as some of my favorite musicians played onstage. I would recommend watching in this in 5.1 on a home-theater system, as the presence of the music is much more realized.<br /><br />I disagree with Amazon's assessment that ZZ Top as a closing act was anti-climactic. The group is monumental in the history of rock and they are at the top of the Texas blues-rock genre. I saw it as befitting to have them close this show, especially in the state of Texas.

1401302378|5.0|I read a great book (actually I listened to it on the seven CD set) that is a must read for any business person called, \\"The Long Tail, Why the future of business is selling less of more\\" by Chris Anderson. Chris Anderson is the editor of FAST Company magazine.<br /><br />The thesis of his book is that we are increasingly able to cater almost everybody with every taste with a huge degree of variety and this huge degree of variety allows products to have what he calls long tails. For example, rather than everybody simply listening to popular music, they can listen to many sub-genres.<br /><br />Much of what he talks about is possible because of the Internet so a lot of his examples have to do with books and music and movies, etc., on the internet.<br /><br />The reason it is a must read for any business person is understanding markets and where things will sell are definitely a critical part of business success.
B000N3SRRC|2.0|I have been a fan of Clutch ever since Elephant Riders came out.  As far as Elephant/Pure Rock/Blast & Robot goes, this album is for sure my least favourite except for the dismal Jam Room (between Elephant & Pure Rock), which has Who Wants To Rock? as its only real saving grace.   <br /> <br />Beale Street for me just seems to neander along without really winding up and getting going.  The boys don't even seem that convinced of the songs themselves.  They lack power and passion.  There are better songs on Slow Hole To China.  This album is more kind of old school Clutch (think elephant crossed with their self titled), however the songs just aren't as good. <br /> <br />Clutch has had a mean streak to their music ever since Impetus and their debut album Transnational Speedway League, and production wise have built up quite a chunky sound over the last six or seven years especially on Blast Tyrant and Robot Hive/Exodus.  Beale Street lacks that same punch, and after Blast Tyrant and Robot Hive/exodus it is a step backwards. <br /> <br />I was really looking foward to this, but this album is a little under done.
B000EHSVQ4|2.0|If you liked the original theatrical release (which was the first version of the film that made it to DvD) and own it, more than like you have all you'll need from KoH. I REALLY enjoyed the theatrical release, purchased it...and then later bought this version of the film based on many of its Amazon reviews. While it does add a great deal of watching time to the film, the extra footage really does little to improve the quality of the story or increase the depth of the characters to any \\"interesting\\" degree. Add to that, that this version of the film doesnt include the great documentaries(History Channel) found on the original DvD release. As I have shared, I REALLY enjoyed Kingdom of Heaven.....but didnt/havent found the purchase of this version to be an improvement over the original in the least. More doesnt always equal better.....
0374105235|5.0|Just finished watching Ishmael Beah being interviewed by Brian Lamb on C-Span Q and A.  If he writes as well as he speaks, this will be an absorbing book.  I just ordered it. <br /> <br />Will be painful to read, as I was part of the Sierra Leone \\"before the war\\" as Ishmael calls it, as a Peace Corps Volunteer during the Kennedy years.  I loved it there.  I am glad he has included what it was like before the violence started to give everyone a broader perspective.
0156027321|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. The descriptions it contains and the story line are inspiring to say the least. A must for any animal lover, explorer or dreamer.
0596101996|5.0|This book is divided into four parts - Part 1 covers core JavaScript and it has an incredible amount of detail and examples illustrating fundamentals and intricate details of the language. As the author points out amply by giving specific code examples, even experienced programmers will be surprised by unexpected behavior if they are not careful! Part 2 covers Client-Side JavaScript which is of most interest to web developers - this book simply does an outstanding job of presenting various topics in this part with amazing clarity. Part 3 has Core JavaScript Reference and some of the examples and explanations from Part 1 refer to this part. Part 4 has Client JavaScript Reference and there are references to this part from some chapters of Part 2 as you may expect. Essentially, parts 3 and 4 have the comprehensive API reference. <br /> <br />I read parts 1, 2 in full and I tested the code examples. For the most part, the examples run fine without any problem. The only exception was the chapter 23 that explains scripting flash and I was getting some exception when I tried to run it in both IE and Firefox. Where there are significant differences between IE and Firefox, this book does point out which is really helpful since these two are the most widely used browsers. While this book is not a light read, it is very comprehensive and therefore the only book you ever need on JavaScript. With this book (and possibly few searches on google searches), any one will have all info needed to implement specific functionality using JavaScript. Highly recommended to both novice users and highly experienced JavaScript programmers/developers. <br /> <br />
B000BKVQTS|4.0|THE BROTHERS GRIMM is a thrilling adventure from the mind of Terry Gilliam set against the backdrop of a fairy tale with two protagonists pulled from real life.  The story stars Matt Damon and Heath Ledger as Will and Jacob Grimm, the two scholars of history who traveled throughout Germany gathering the old fairy tales and legends that had been passed down through the generations through storytelling and collected them together in one collection.  Except, the Will and Jacob Grimm in THE BROTHERS GRIMM only resemble the real Brothers Grimm in name only.  In this story, THE BROTHERS GRIMM are a pair of sibling con artists, traveling from town to town fighting and apparently defeating one supernatural being after another, from ghosts to witches and trolls.  When they fight a creature it appears quite remarkable, but that's only because of all the gadgets and stage techniques the duo uses.  The ghouls and goblins are only their stage hands covered in makeup and assisted by lighting, pulleys, springs, and wires.  It makes for a great show and with at least one villager present to witness the event, it brings in a lot of money. The Germans love the Brothers Grimm.<br /><br />However, Germany is under the control of the French and the French aren't as disposed to superstitions, myths, and legends as the locals.  When ten young girls in the village of Marbaden disappear the locals become so frightened that the French fear a revolt.  General Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce) has the brothers arrested and places them under the care of the famed torture artist Cavaldi (Peter Stormare).  Delatombe threatens to give the brothers over to Cavaldi unless they are able to find the missing girls in Marbaden.  Upon their arrival, they hire a local woman, Angelika (Lena Headey) to guide them through the forest.  She does and the brothers begin to realize that maybe there is some truth to fairy tales after all as they come face to face with a man who can transform into a wolf, an evil gingerbread man, and a wicked ageless queen.<br /><br />Though THE BROTHERS GRIMM is a complete work of fiction, in the hands of Terry Gilliam it becomes a masterpiece of fantasy.  As every good storyteller knows, fairy tales have heroes and villains and end happily.  However, fairy tales are also very dark.  They are supposed to be that way because they help us (and especially children) understand a world that is often very cruel and full of pain and suffering.  THE BROTHER GRIMM is a grand fairy tale and in the telling it weaves together elements of many of the real Brothers Grimm's most famous tales: Cinderella, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, The Gingerbread Man, Rapunzel, etc.<br /><br />I like Terry Gilliam as a director, but his films have been somewhat hit and miss the past few years.  THE BROTHERS GRIMM is one that falls into the hit column.  I thoroughly enjoyed the film.  The movie was engaging and captivating.  I especially liked how Damon and Ledger played the opposite type of roles they normally play.  I also like discovering the allusions to the various Grimm fairy tales scattered throughout the movie.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of Gilliam, people who enjoy fantasy movies, and families who don't mind watching a fairy tale film told the way a fairy tale should be told.<br /><br />The DVD includes a director's commentary with Gilliam, which is worth the time to listen through if you have it.  There are a few deleted scenes, including the most expensive scene in the whole film: Will and Jake and Angelika fighting a giant tree.  There are a couple of behind the scenes featurettes, \\"Bringing Fairy Tale to Life\\" and \\"The Visual Magic of THE BROTHERS GRIMM\\".bread man, and a wicked ageless queen. <br /> <br />Though THE BROTHERS GRIMM is a complete work of fiction, in the hands of Terry Gilliam it becomes a masterpiece of fantasy.

0143038419|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert is simply brilliant in this book. Having been to all three countries (Italy, India and Bali), what she writes about them is right on the mark. Her blazing personal insights in her year-long quest are tempered with unmatched wit and a deep, humble,  non-threatening spirituality that makes me want to book my own official quest and follow in her footsteps.

B00005JPLU|5.0|I went to this movie solely to see Gerard Butler as I am a huge fan.  If he wasn't in it I definitely wouldn't have paid to see it at the theater and chances are I wouldn't have worked real hard to see it on DVD, either.  It is not at all the type of film I normally flock to or enjoy, but I was more than pleasantly surprised at how much I thoroughly enjoyed this film.<br /><br />This is probably one of the most visually appealing movies I have seen in a long time.  It was like watching artwork come to life, a feast for the eyes.  The acting was excellent; Gerard Butler was a strong and commanding lead as King Leonidas. He was a physically imposing warrior, leading his men to battle, yet there were surprisingly tender and human moments as well. Lena Headey managed to portray Queen Gorgo as a strong, powerful woman, while maintaining extreme femininity.  King Xerxes was by far the most flamboyant of characters, his costume was of multiple piercings and jewels, he exuded arrogance and narcissism.  A powerful man, who referred to himself as God, was made complete by his large size and deep voice.<br /><br />I was expecting an overly violent blood bath of a film.  Truth be told, I was surprised at its lack of violence.  A lot of the violence is implied and then you see the flinging and spurting of blood.  There were only a few scenes where I actually cringed or had to shut my eyes.  There were even a handful of touching moments that made me weepy, another unexpected. The music was another unforeseen enjoyment. It flowed seamlessly from hauntingly beautiful chant like choruses to powerfully driven techno beats.  I liked the music so much, that I remained after the movie to watch the credits and find out who did the soundtrack.<br /><br />Is this movie historically accurate?  Will the History Channel be airing it as a documentary meant to educate the masses on the Spartans, the Persians and the battle of Thermopylae?  Absolutely not.  I went to see a movie based on a comic book, loosely based on history and that's what I saw.  300 is a very entertaining movie and I will definitely be purchasing it on DVD.n history and that's what I saw.  300 is a very entertaining movie and I will definitely be purchasing it on DVD.

It made me go and buy the other album in the performance series, live at the fillmore east. <br /> <br />I like the DVD quality as well, and on a good system it sounds fantastic.. However if you only want to listen in your car, just get the cd version... <br /> <br />Reminds me in someways of the other mellow Neil Young Album Unplugged.
B000EOUTTY|5.0|Can someone please comment about the remastering? What is this release?
0618680004|3.0|Interesting opinion, but has to be downgraded for wordiness. If Reader's Digest would condense this book it would be a pamphlet.
B00003CWN3|5.0|This is the true story of Teena Brandon (Hillary Swank), a lonely teenage girl living as a man, \\"Brandon Teena.\\"  She's been in trouble with the law and has no roots.  When she comes to a new town, she is befriended by a \\"family\\" of perpetually drunk low-lifes, and is especially attracted to Lana (Chloe Sevigny), who dreams of going to Memphis and being a karaoke singer.  Brandon and Chloe fall in love, angering two men who begin to suspect Brandon's true identity.<br /><br />Swank's performance as Brandon/Teena is simply remarkable.  She conveys the heartbreak and misery of an outsider, a misfit, and the need for love that is universal; she won the Oscar in 1999 for this role.  Sevigny is convincing as the girl who falls in love with both Brandon and Teena.  Despite its low-budget (Swank earned only $3,000), this is an extremely well-made, thought-provoking, and deeply moving for adults.  (There are sexual and extremely violent scenes.)  A riveting, shocking, and very sad story with sensitive acting and direction.
B000MV9026|2.0|I have kids now, I go out some times and spend money on DVDs that I think I may be able to enjoy with them, and usually my instincts find me quality movies that are fun and entertaining for every age. But not always apparently.... as I went out last week and spent a cool twenty bucks on this waste of time.<br />I didn't read any reviews as I usually would. I heard so much raving on this one, that I figured it must be somewhat good.<br />First off, the movie doesn't focus very much on getting any sort of laughs... in fact for the most part the story just gets more and more deppressing at it goes on...<br />The big happy ending isn't even that great, and I can tell you straight up, I hated the way that penguin danced. The taps didn't even match his f*in feet!<br />The penguins all were creepy looking.<br />The story was weak.<br />The music was terrible. (Lets talk about sex?)<br />Robin Williams is the voice of not one, but I believe three or four different characters.<br />Now, I don't usually make it a habit to write bad reviews, but for all the acclaim this movie got, I expected to be entertained. My baby boy was bored as hell. I say, rent this one at least, before you buy it... cuz it just may not be your (or your KIDS) cup of tea.<br /><br />I gave my two stars for the classic Looney Tune, I LIKE TO SING cartoon that was oddly added to the bonus features.

B000MXPE7O|4.0|In the Sunday paper I read a piece about how children of E. Howard Hunt now state that he had been approached by rogue CIA Agents who were against JFK for not supplying air cover for the Bay of Pigs invasion to join in their assassination plot.  According to the article, the hit was supposed to be in Miami, but LBJ moved the location to Dallas where he could  better control security.  Supposedly Hunt declined.  Even though it was long, this movie ended too soon.  I would rather it had gone far enough to prove that Oliver Stone was closer to the truth, or even may have been spot on.  It sort of hints at the end that the CIA had its CIA within the CIA though... <br /> <br />BTW, Angelina Jolie may not have been miscast.  I believe persons of her character type did exist in that time span...
B000MGUZM0|5.0|My appreciation for this album has come in stages.  Upon peeling off the cellophane of this highly anticipated release, my first response was that the Arcade Fire had gone overboard with the capital they had acquired from the success of their excellent debut release FUNERAL.  It sounded overblown and incredibly dense, like too many ideas shoved into a small place.  After a couple more listens, the songs and details began to come into focus and my attitude towards it began to improve.  After about five listens, I came to the conclusion that this was a great album that no doubt will be one of the best released this year.  It's that good.<br /><br />Standouts include MY BODY IS A CAGE, NO CARS GO, WELL AND THE LIGHTHOUSE and ANTICHRIST TELEVISION BLUES.  The over the top church organ on INTERVENTION makes that a unique and rewarding track.  The band's sometimes baroque arrangements manage not to suppress the fine lyrics that are filled with spirituality and dread.<br /><br />If you've come to the Arcade Fire through their debut, chances are that you will be more than satisfied with NEON BIBLE. Newcomers to the band will need to approach this release with patience that will no doubt be rewarded.
B000M341QE|5.0|Warning: this is the most cruelly violent and intense movie to come down the pike in a while - some of the meanest, most detestable characters you'll ever encounter in a story. Yet, if you can handle it, the plot is brilliantly conceived  and developed in this film.
B000HEVZ8K|5.0|I'm so glad I've got this film in HD!<br /><br />I can't help but be compelled to view this film multiple times - it's just that captivating!

B000GRUMPU|2.0|This film suffers in comparison to others, namely the \\"original\\", and [[ASIN:B000ANVQ0K Titanic]]. One wonders at the wisdom of greenlighting this project and approving a budget of $160 million. That question becomes more relevant during the opening credits. Not to disrespect either actor, but Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss are past their A-list days. <br /> <br />Not only does POSEIDON suffer in comparison to other films, it suffers from filmmakers more concerned with a visual product than any other components. For main characters, we're given a group that you could pluck down in just about any thriller and watch them run with little or no guidance: in other words, they're stock characters. We've seen them hundreds of times: the former fire-fighter turned Mayor turned wealthy gambler, the former navy guy who can navigate his way through a ship that's turned upside down with remarkable pinpoint accuracy, the gay man with a can't-miss-it-sized earring in his right ear who's there just to be gay, a single mother with a young cute son who makes endearing comments and looks just so, the mayor's daughter who is nervous around him for no apparent reason, and the guy who wants the mayor's daughter to marry him who calls him sir. Nothing new here. <br /> <br />What was surprising, however, was that the filmmakers approached POSEIDON with a take-no-prisoners attitude. Everyone's life was up for grabs, and I mean everyone's. They killed off one of their initial main characters almost immediately, and that set up the possibility of real tension. Without having done that, this film would have been a waste. <br /> <br />But a film can't build a reputation by having great special effects and killing people indiscriminately. It needs a story, a plot, people that we care about so that when they die we care...and this just didn't have it. <br /> <br />2½ stars. <br />
B00005JPEG|5.0|When I was invited to view this film, admittedly there were a few reservations. A bio of the famous children's author and illustrator in 19th century England was not at the top of my \\"must see\\" film list. Although dragged along hesitantly, the film surpassed all expectations, leaving the theatre believing the world is a better place.<br /><br />Beatrix Potter is a woman to be admired and a model for young women to emulate even in the 21st century. An artist in the fullest sense of the term, she created animal characters and charming stories that continue to be read by millions of children and their parents today. What makes Potter an example is her devotion to her art form and her diligence to be published in a \\"man's world\\".<br /><br />Renee Zellweger is also a true artist, her acting seemingly getting better and better with every new project. Although her English accent has been the butt of jokes in the British media, she has those difficult nuances down pat when speaking the \\"Queen's English\\". For this particular role, she trained with a voice coach to ensure the accents authenticity, as many English actresses, wanting the part of the great English author, were poised and ready to pounce on Zellweger's performance, however, her performance left no room for criticism, as her role was played with subtlety and restraint.<br /><br />One of the many themes in this wonderful film is England's class snobbery, personified beautifully by Barbra Flynn, as Beatrix mother. Ironically, so-called upper middle-class society and money, as Beatrix so eloquently points out in the film, came from the working and merchant trades of the industrial revolution. When Miss Potter wants to marry her publisher (Ewan McGregor) she is prevented from doing so because he comes from the \\"trade classes\\". Beatrix attempts to overcome these hypocritical prejudices, and manages to negotiate a proposal to marry the man; however, the tale takes a serious turn at this point, moving the plot in another direction.<br /><br />Director Chris Noonan, to my knowledge, has not made a film since his masterpiece, Babe. Interestingly in both films animals have the mind and emotions of people. Noonan has brought that same magical atmosphere of Babe to Miss Potter giving each film an innocent quality without falling into sentimentality.<br /><br />Miss Potter is an enchanting film, pleasant to watch leaving the viewer feeling amiable and positive about the world.in another direction. <br /> <br />Director Chris Noonan, to my knowledge, has not made a film since his masterpiece, Babe.

B000N4SHPS|2.0|I wasn't sure what I was watching: an adoring public saying good-bye to ex-champ Rocky Balboa, or Sylvester Stallone in an embarrassing plea for relevance or redemption. In the end, I think it was the latter. The telling clue was in Paulie's speech to Rocky before Rocky entered the ring. Paulie said (and I paraphrase), \\"tonight get it out of your system once and for all\\". He was referring to the stuff that Rocky said was in his \\"basement\\", the anger that he had in his gut. As Stallone wrote the screenplay, I think he was talking to himself. I wonder what speech he'll give as John Rambo in the upcoming \\"John Rambo\\" movie that's filming. (I'll never know, and I won't miss it.)    All art must pass the test of credibility and this failed. Rocky, a punch-drunk pugilist morphed into a dime store philosopher. It felt as if Stallone was reaching back for the easy dialogue of the first Rocky film - still a classic IMO. That easy dialogue was written thirty years ago, though, and this time around it didn't come easy. Stallone is a different person, and therefore a different writer. People grow; they change. Yet here he presents us with yet another Rocky film, with a main character desperate *not* to change. (We may as well be speaking of Stallone himself.) A Rocky that wants to get back into the ring, relive his glory days, get whatever he didn't get out of his gut the first time around when he lost a staggering and entirely unbelievable twenty-three fights. A Stallone desperate to...yeah, I've said that already.    The vehicle Stallone chooses as Rocky's spark is absurd. ESPN does a \\"cartoon\\" simulation of a fight between the current heavyweight champion (Mason \\"the Line\\" Dixon, played by Antonion Tarver who is a former light-heavyweight champion and has a few grand delusions of his own), and the simulation predicts that Rocky would win. In the real world, this wouldn't have raised more than an eyebrow. In Stallone's world, in whatever illogical, deranged universe he has placed Rocky in, this grew to an exhibition pay-per-view fight worth millions held in Las Vegas, where nobody goes to lose.    An exhibition PPV? Who are they kidding? I understand that this is fiction and that suspension of disbelief is expected, but this is absurd. I'm a boxing, er, fan, I suppose. A reluctant fan in that I don't enjoy the violence but do enjoy the competition. My point? I know the game, and I can state with absolute certainty that an exhibition PPV between a young, strong champion and an aging (50s!) fighter who has shown signs of brain damage in previous films would never be sanctioned. For that matter, no fight between said combatants would be sanctioned anywhere in the U.S.A.    I will give the film this: it used a real boxing promoter (Lou diBella, and also showed the production flag for De La Hoya's company, Golden Boy Promotions), real boxing commentators (all from HBO: Max Kellerman, Larry Merchant, and Jim Lampley), a real ring announcer (Michael Buffer - \\"Let's get ready to rumble!\\"), a real referee (Joe Cortez), and the weigh-in official was the Nevada State boxing commissioner (Marc Ratner). Mike Tyson even made a punk appearance, showing up at the fight and calling out Dixon. There were others, too, such as the commentators from ESPN (Brian Kenney).    I heard that the fight choreography was going to be superb. It wasn't. The punches looked no more real than they ever have, and the beatings that each fighter took were impossibly brutal. In this film, Rocky is over fifty years old. Any referee, *especially* Joe Cortez, would have stopped the fight in the second round when the fifty-year-old contender is knocked down twice and severely wobbled several other times. Rocky still hasn't learned to keep his gloves up so he's quite literally a human punching bag. I wonder if there's a metaphor in that last sentence for Stallone.    Let's hope that Stallone is finished with Rocky. I am.

B0007XT87G|5.0|I'm closing in on 50 years of age. Way back in the late sixties and the early seventies I was constantly bombarded with music that was inventive and always good. It was a high point in the history of rock, and from what I had been able to hear since then I assumed I would never hear anything that good again. Sure there were some good things coming out now and then, but nothing compared to those old bands and so I resigned myself to what I thought was the fact that the greatest that rock music had to offer was in the past. In fact I have to admit I was starting to grow a little bored with the whole rock and roll scene recently. And then just two weeks ago I heard Porcupine Tree for the first time. I couldn't believe my ears! Here was a band that created not just good music, but great music! I heard Deadwing and immediately went out and started buying their records. I bought Up the Downstair and In Absentia along with Deadwing, and I loved it all. The next day I sought out more. I found Signify and Stupid Dream and ordered copies of Coma Divine, On the Sunday of Life and The Sky Moves Sideways. All of those arrived within a week and during that week I downloaded the unreleased and live music available from their online shop. In short I've become a Porcupine Tree addict! And what luck: they have a new album coming out later this month! I went to a rather well known download store and bought the Blackfield 2 release mainly because it includes the title track from the forthcoming album, but I'm also really enjoying the Blackfield record as well. Needless to say I've spent a lot of money on their music in a very short period of time, and every single dime was well spent. According to the insert information in the repackaged versions of Signify and Coma Divine, both Lightbulb Sun and Recordings will also be re-released later this year, so I'll hold off on buying used copies of those (if I can wait).  <br />Porcupine Tree have restored my faith in rock music again. I haven't been this excited about music since the good old days. In fact, thanks to Porcupine Tree, the good old days are here again. Unfortunately you just can't hear great music like this on the radio, so the only way to know it's there is for people who know about it to spread the word. For anyone who loves Pink Floyd, King Crimson, and Tangerine Dream I would say buy some Porcupine Tree. You'll probably wonder why you've never heard of them before as well. It surely shows the sad state of the music industry when something this good doesn't get the exposure it deserves.  <br />Buy it. Play it. Buy a copy for a friend. Long Live Porcupine Tree. <br /> If anyone has any recommendations beyond Porcupine Tree that they think I would like, I would appreciate it.
B0000009SI|5.0|\\"Apostrophe\\" was the first time a lot of people heard any Zappa material, as no radio station would play Zappa's music, with or without The Mothers Of Invention, and it put some people off, with the song about \\"Yellow Snow,\\" but as usual, the absurd lyrics and story belie some very serious musicianship.<br /><br />The relaxed atmosphere of this release makes for some very easy listening, and I would call it a jazz record, even with the heavily distorted guitar work. The slow bass lines and light drumming, for the most part, set the backdrop for the soloists to play some blistering arrangements, and even the rhythm section goes into overdrive here and there, see \\"Saint Alphonso's Pancake Breakfast/Father O'Blivion\\" sequence for comfirmation of this. At times, the material can be a little suggestive, but self-censorship, the only censorship I support, ensures a \\"clean\\" listening experience. The live version of this piece, in Volume One of the \\"You Can't Do That On Stage\\" series, gives the listener the uncut version of the words and concepts as originally created.<br /><br />Of course, there is some progressive, foreward-looking material, as in the otherworldly \\"Excentrigugal Forz,\\" and free-form jamming in the title track, where Jack Bruce plays a typical Cream-style bass solo to Tony Duran's rhythm guitar arrangement. Follow this with Mother Superior himself, FZ's solo, and Jim Gordon's drum solo, and a free-for-all fade out, and you have some intense performing here.<br /><br />\\"Uncle Remus\\" gives this an ethnic feel, with the soulful back-up vocals and George Duke's beautiful piano playing, and of course, the jagged-edged guitar solo Zappa was so fond of at the time, and you have a minor masterpiece.<br /><br />Silly stories are told in this record, as with the opening suite of \\"Don't Eat The Yellow Snow/Nanook Rubs It/St. Alphonso's Pancake Breakfast/Father O'Blivion,\\" the dark and sinister sounding \\"Cosmik Debris,\\" and the completely inane \\"Stinkfoot.\\" A song about foot-odor, one would think, could never be taken seriously, but it is given a serious treatment, with a vamp to jam on, a double-tracked guitar solo (really cool trick, feeding the same signal into two amplifiers with a dry, clean sound on one channel, and a wah pedal in the other, played on one instrument, but splitting the signal to make it sound like dual guitarists), and just as good a production as any of his other compositions. Yes, it's silly, and kind of dated, but still very enjoyable.<br /><br />\\"Apostrophe\\" is a good, radio-friendly piece of Americana, circa 1974, and an excellent place to start your budding Zappa collection.song about foot-odor, one would think, could never be taken seriously, but it is given a serious treatment, with a vamp to jam on, a double-tracked guitar solo (really cool trick, feeding the same signal into two amplifiers with a dry, clean sound on one channel, and a wah pedal in the other, played on one instrument, but splitting the signal to make it sound like dual guitarists), and just as good a production as any of his other compositions.

0375831002|5.0|THE BOOK THIEF is a beautiful and carefully worded story, following four years in the life of young Liesel Meminger, a poor German girl who finds herself separated from her six-year-old brother (who dies) and her mother and father (taken away by the Nazi's for being a communist), and fostered to Rosa and Hans Hubermann. <br /> <br />Arriving at the Hubermann's, nine-years-old and already burdened with great loss, Liesel forges a deep bond with her Papa, Hans - a man with a many-roomed heart - who sits with her at night when her nightmares force her awake with screams. It is during these nights that Hans teaches her to read, and they begin with the first book she ever \\"stole\\": The Grave-Diggers Handbook, a book that fell out of the pocket of a fourteen-year-old grave digger who dug the grave for her brother. Like a kitten who finds comfort at the teat of a sow after losing its mother, Liesel begins to find comfort in words. <br /> <br />The story is narrated by no less a personage than Death, although this Death is sans hooded-skull and scythe. Indeed, we learn little more about Death than he is not what we perceive him to be in our Halloween imitations, and very good at his job. Given the setting for this story, we are guaranteed of the chance to evaluate Death's job performance. <br /> <br />Zusak writes with a deft, poetic hand, his descriptions unconventional and mesmerizing. Rosa Hubermann is \\"a small wardrobe with a coat hung over it\\". A woman's mouth has teeth that elbow each other for room. A boy: \\"His tie is a pendulum, long dead in its clock.\\" These images jump from the page and give us a clearer picture of what we're seeing than if Zusak had spent hours describing the tiniest detail of Rosa Hubermann's body. <br /> <br />Along the way, Liesel shares her interest in words, and in no place is that felt more potently than in her relationship with Max Vandenburg, a Jew who her parents hide in their basement. Max arrives nearly dead, and the much younger Lieselfinds herself captivated by him. When the cold in the basement pushes Max to the brink of death, they move him to Liesel's room for (I believe) eight days, where Liesel brings him small mementos and reads to him while he fights for life (and once against Death itself!). In turn, Max writes for her - and these books-within-a-book are more touching and meaningful, more full of love and hope while not betraying the slightest hint of over-dramatization, than anything I've come across in years. Indeed, if this story had been only about Liesel's relationship with Max, it would have been an enormous success. It may also have been more widely read - I suspect that the length of the book and the immediacy present in Max's story but not as equally present in other sections, put some people off. <br /> <br />Before I read the book, I looked at the negative reviews (of which there are four). One review commented that the book felt like \\"work\\". Reading Hawthorne can be work, too, but I always feel the better for having read him. <br />
B000KGGLCU|5.0|I've watched the dvd so much since receiving it that I now watch it from a technical point of view as the concert is happening.  Some observations: watch how she makes eye contact several times during the concert with individual members of her dance troop; watch how she deftly hands off her microphone when necessary; and how she gets it back when she's ready to continue singing.  Madonna has been critiqued as a mediocre actress in some of her movies.  The multi-facets of Madonna's personality comes out in this concert.  Watch for them.  She reveals so many different aspects of herself.  Watch how she interacts with the live audience and pulls them into the performance.  Watch for her perfectly staged exits. <br /> <br />Madonna truly is the Master and this performance exemplifies it.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|I just bought the DVD of Munich . I had heard that \\"Munich\\" was going to be long and dull and pointless, and boy was I glad I saw it anyway. Eric Bana and Daniel Craig are great in this.! <br /> <br />The film is almost a slasher movie in a screwed up way. It chronicles the journey of a hit man (played great by a very intense Eric Bana) who is hired in secret by the Israeli government , to kill off the terrorists responsible for the munich hostage taking and murders. His job is totally secret, like he doesn't exist at all. Then he travels Europe and hunts down these guys one by one and almost gets them all. Then he starts having doubts about the whole adventure when he starts to see the whole human aspect of it. <br /> <br />I found it very exciting. <br /> <br />As a cool perk, there's also Daniel Craig in his pre-Bond days. I'd almost say he's better here than as 007 , but Bana shines in this all the way through. <br /> <br />Munich was very well made and exciting and a strong filmmaker's vision. I think this is one of Spielberg's strongest movies to date. An extra perk is a short commentary by Spielberg before the movie starts, that shows us his intentions of making the movie.  <br /> <br />kudos.
B000M5B6Q0|4.0|As soon as the song \\"Pop goes my heart,\\" came on in the theater, my friends and began hysterically laughing, and not just because the video was hilarious, but because we knew that if it had actually been made in the 80's, we would have loved it.  The song embodied the classic 80's elements of a hit pop song.  Then there's \\"Way back into love,\\" which I could not get out of my head for weeks.  This cd is filled with catchy tunes that you won't be able to get out of your head.  If you liked the movie, you will surely like this cd.
0743496728|4.0|I really enjoyed most of this book although I found that things got kind of bogged down and slow-moving in the middle.  I did not enjoy it nearly as much, however, as I enjoyed We Need To Talk About Kevin - one of my favorite books of all time!  I disagree with an earlier reviewer, though, who said that We Need To Talk About Kevin was great without having to rely on a \\"twist\\" ending as did Nineteen Minutes.  Hey, did we read the same book???  \\"Kevin\\" had one of the all-time best \\"twist\\" endings that I ever read!  As a matter of fact, there were several twists - one after another - and they left me with my mouth hanging open, both literally and figuratively.  Nineteen Minute's twist was not in the same league as it was somewhat predictable.  That said, Nineteen Minutes is probably my favorite Jodi Picoult novel to date.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|This is a far more physical Bond than any we've seen before. Daniel Craig exudes strength, power and, indeed, a raw sexual allure. This Bond is also more tender, gentle, and fallible. It's also a Bond that spends quite a bit of time baring his skin. Good thing Mr. Craig is familiar with the inside of a gym. <br /> <br />The plot of the film is simple enough. A rogue financier of rebellious factions, Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelson), has gambled with the money entrusted to him and lost it all. He must regain it in a game of poker with an astonishing stake: $150 million. Bond has, as allies, Versper Lynd (Eva Green, Kingdom of Heaven), and Matthis (Giancarlo Giannini, Hanibal). <br /> <br />For such a simple plot, this was highly entertaining. The action scenes are believable to the point of pain, and Daniel Craig stakes his claim as Bond more powerfully than anyone since Connery. <br /> <br />The high-tech gadgets we've come to expect in every scene of a Bond film aren't as much in evidence here, but there are enough for the techno nerd in anyone. <br />
630463949X|5.0|This band is at the top of their game, and the guitar work is superb. The surround sound top quality.
B000O178BY|5.0|This album is another wonderful composition of talent and expression from Mr. Reznor. The music is absolutely beautiful in some places, and in contrast becomes full of noise and the most tasteful patches of loud angry metal in other places. He will never cease to amaze any of us who try to judege him on his ability to score wonderful music tracks. <br /> <br />The lyrics on the other hand... <br />We all remember The Downward Spiral, Broken and Pretty Hate Machine, it was full of lies, whores and a bundle of other ideas ripped straight from a very broken and dismayed man's diary. Trent Reznor's lyrics have always been close to brilliant but only a few songs have really hit it with a huge amount of inginuity and creativity as far as word play and vocabulary. Still it surpasses that of most other bands recieving air play. <br />To see another great artist go the way of the political/world problem train is a bit of a turn off. We all knew it was bound to happen. Atleast most of the album chooses to go in a different direction then the \\"in your face\\" remarks about Bush and the current administration. <br />In all this album takes little pieces from all of Reznor's albums to date: Broken, Downward Spiral, Pretty Hate Machine, and even a little from The Fragile. I believe it will prove to be another chapter in his ever growing library of work.
0743270754|5.0|I bought this book as a birthday gift for my son, a very well educated graduate of Williams College, and an avid reader of fine fiction and non-fiction. Having read several reviews of the book, but not having read it, I took a small risk and had it shipped to him. We recently visited there, and found how very delighted he is with it. During the visit, I took every opportunity to get into it myself, and can't wait to get my hands on a copy myself. A 5-star achievement by Ms. Goodwin, who is a favorite of ours on the Jim Lehrer News on PBS.
B000NA2776|5.0|This CD has left me scratching my head. First off, its really good, but the bigger issue is, how do you categorize it? Anyone who's heard it in my car asks \\"Is this Queen?\\" Yes, Mika sounds incredibly like Freddie Mercury (the flambouyancy and the incredible falsetto) but he also sounds equal parts the Scissor Sisters, Robbie Williams, KT Tunstall, George Michael and an early Elton John.  <br /> <br />This album is equal parts kitschy pop, haunting balads, catchy dance hooks and just pure 100% fun music. Stand out tracks include Relax (Take It Easy), Ring Ring, Big Girl, Erase and ofcoure the brilliant Grace Kelly.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00006FDCD|3.0|The first half of this movie is great. The acting is good, the effects are fine, and it is very true to the book. The second half however, is kinda lame. The special effects get cheesy (especially at the end), the acting is not as good as the first half, and it srayed away from the novel. Tim Curry (who looks like he is enjoying the heck out of it) is the best part of the film, it is possibly my favorite role of his. I give five stars to the first half and maybe two and a half stars for the second half.
B00006L83N|5.0|This album is epic.  Accolade II, Awakenings, and The Odyssey are amongst the greatest songs i've ever heard.  Go get this album now!
B000MRAAJW|4.0|The first couple of episodes on The Discovery Channel look wonderful.  Is this the same series?  Discovery is narrated by Sigourney Weaver and this BBC series seems to be narrated by David Attenborough.  I don't really care who's talking, but I'm would like to make sure the footage is the same before I purchase this.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I'm a writer, and I find this CD perfect to listen to when writing. It's very deep and emotional, and has a pretty dark backbeat mixed with lyrics that make you feel like your life is perfect compared to theirs. It's also good to put on when you feel like laying in your bed, hating the world.
1400062756|5.0|I'm reading this book a second time because although what the author writes may seem very obvious, I think many of us tend to ignore that and go to the familiar or what is \\"fixed\\" in our own lives.  Easy to read and relate to.  Uses a wide variety of examples to illustrate points.  A very enjoyable, optimistic book.
B0007GAERG|3.0|When i first listened to this cd i didn't like it too much, but after playing it a few times some of the other songs grew on me. Worth it just to get the hits though.
B000J103PC|5.0|\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is a funny fast-paced story about the world of high fashion.  Meryl Streeps' performance is riveting.  She has two Oscars (Best Supporting Actress for \\"Kramer vs. Kramer\\" 1979 & Best Actress for \\"Sophie's Choice\\" 1982).  \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" was her 13th Oscar nomination.  For this film she won awards from the Golden Globes, London Film Critics Circle, National Society of Film Critics, Satellite Awards and Women's Film Critics Circle.  Her performance is an amazingly controlled one.  We see her as the quintessential difficult boss with snide quips and impossible demands.  The scene that totally makes the film for me is the one where she sits in the hotel in Paris without makeup and tells Andy about her latest divorce.  Her disappointment is so real, muted and emotionally deep that it throws all of the rest of the character into perspective.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway's performance is easy to overlook, even though it is the lead.  Her basic chore as Andy Sachs is to make us like her.  She accomplishes this.  She goes from the one they call \\"the fat girl\\" to a high fashion professional meeting all of the demands and repeatedly placing job over her personal life.  At the film's climax, she makes her decision & changes course.  She doesn't have any wild quirks like Streep's Miranda Priestly or Emily Blunt's Emily, but she makes the film accessible for the viewer.<br /><br />British actress Emily Blunt plays the first assistant Emily.  (Did they rename the character or was this a coincidence?)  She won the Best Supporting Actress award from the London Film Critics Circle and has translated this high profile role into five upcoming films!  (\\"The Snow Goose,\\" \\"The Girl in the Park,\\" \\"Wind Chill,\\" \\"The Great Buck Howard\\" & \\"The Jane Austin Book Club.\\")  Her snide quips and cold exterior are hysterically superficial as she treats Andy with a \\"kick the dog\\" mentality.<br /><br />Standley Tucci does a good job as Nigel.  His cold wisdom is so picky and prickly that we love to hate him instantly.  Adrian Grenier who was in several films I saw (\\"Cecil B. Demented\\" & \\"Hart's War\\") plays her boyfriend Nate.  His wide-eyed, slightly ethnic good looks play well opposite Hathaway.  Australian Simon Baker plays the writer Christian Thompson who eventually beds Andy in Paris.  He oozes romantic charm.<br /><br />\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is about superficiality and artifice, which may make some think that the film isn't about anything significant.  But at its heart is the desire to get ahead and success at all costs.  It asks the cogent philosophical question, \\"Does the end justify the means?\\"  However, it also presents a world of perfectionists for whom excellence is the standard.  I found the film funny and moving, filled with excellent performances.  Enjoy!icky and prickly that we love to hate him instantly.  Adrian Grenier who was in several films I saw (\\"Cecil B.

B00000IQC8|2.0|I seem to be one of the few people who didn't like this movie.  People either seem to love or hate this movie. It's obvious in the reviews. Those that love it would be more likely to comment, so I suggest that if you are considering seeing this movie, look for the negitive comments to get a balance.<br /><br />No one talks like they did in the film. I've met a broad spectrum of people from every conceivable profession and, none of them spoke the way the people in this piece-of-crap film do. This movie is so overrated its not even slightly funny.
B000LC55F2|5.0|This movie is wonderful.  If you like movies that keep you guessing - especially when you don't even realize it's happening to you until the end - this is the movie for you.  You truly have no idea what has been going on until the last scene.  Everyone should see this movie!
0345409671|5.0|I love all of Anne Rice's books. This is one set of books that I keep to read over and over. If you are a fan of Rice or vampires...you won't be disappointed.
006056251X|5.0|So what happens when Evie and Lord St. Vincent get married? Not for love, either, but convenience.<br /><br />It blossoms into something much more, obviously. Lisa Kleypas did NOT disappoint when she wrote this... it was so true to her Wallflower series, and the style, that I couldn't put it down. It took me less than a day to finish, and I think if you loved the first two (or even just the first one, since the second one wasn't nearly as good) than you will WORSHIP this book. The best in the series, so far. Let's just hope that Scandal in Spring is just as good, although I hope it is.
1582701709|5.0|The book coincides with the film, and a lot of what is written is also in the film.  That being said, however, there is also new information that is not in the film.  I think what I like the most is a section at the end of the book that gives a brief biography of all of the people interviewed in the film as well as all of the famous people quoted throughout the film and book. <br /> <br />If you truly plan on following the secret, the book is a great follow up to the film.  You can take your time and meditate on ideas and thoughts more, because it's easier to pause.  The book also explains ways to use the secrets website and lists the websites of the people interviewed in the film.  A good investment if you are interested in following the secret.

B000MNP2KI|2.0|Casino Royale was quite a disappointment considering the long tradition of excellent Bond movies. <br />The acting is pretty good (but nothing great), the plot is below average, while the dialogues/lines are way beyond \\"below average,\\" and then there's the great locations/scenery... <br />Daniel Craig disappoints in his role as 007; he is rough around the edges and is lacking that something the others had.  Sean Connery was suave, he was, *is*, James Bond.  Roger Moore was a gentleman with an amazing humor, while Pierce Brosnan was one handsome guy who carried himself well, and even Timothy Dalton had something about him that gave him dignity.  Daniel Craig has not shown any of those qualities.  There is nothing about him that screams \\"for Queen and country!\\" <br />In addition, Eva Green, who was great in Kingdom of Heaven, is given weak lines and a bad role.  A shame, really... <br />The dialogues-oh my- the dialogues are beyond words... <br />M is simply pathetic; a highly hysterical and annoying elderly woman. <br />Q is nowhere to be seen. <br />Finally, the amount of brutality is unprecedented for a Bond film.  Kill away and smack around as much as your heart desires, but do not include the extreme type of torture scenes that this movie had.    <br />The positive aspect of the \\"movie\\" is the setting/location, with the scenery being great! <br />So it's a weak plot, a great setting and a relatively good cast, which when put together fail to take off.   <br />
0671015206|5.0|This book puts in perspective our priorities that we should use in life, even if it doesnt make you a millionaire.

B000MV9026|1.0|I don't even want this film in my house.  It's inappropriate for small kids.  It's sexual, scary, depressing, political, racial, discriminatory, boring, insulting, annoying, disturbing ... did I say depressing?  The tapping sound doesn't even match the motion of their feet.  I can't wait for the images to leave my brain.  I hope my four year old isn't permanently damaged.
B000MNP2KI|2.0|The longest ever Bond film is, well, too long.  There are quite a few drawn out scenes with Bond & his interest verbally sparring.  There  were about two or three times when I thought the movie had ended.  I think they showed Craig's body more than all the women in the movie combined.  There was definitely an effort to draw the women to the movie with this one.  Real Bond fans are in for a few rough years - All scenes where Bond smoked were cut and Craig later stated he would like to see a gay scene with Bond in the next movie since he feels the audience is ready for this.  This is way out of the Bond character and movies.  For someone who owns all the movies and has been a Bond fan since a child, this was a hard movie to sit through.  Wasn't Timothy Dalton enough to live through in a lifetime? <br />
B000068GA4|5.0|This CD has been one of my favorites for 17 years, ever since it came out. It was my first exposure to Danzig... despite being a fan of the Misfits before finding this disc, I somehow missed the first Danzig disc. The sound of Danzig the band and of Glenn Danzig's haunting, gorgeous voice are at their best on this CD. I think this is the absolute best Danzig album, with their first release as a close second.
B000E6UWE4|4.0|This is a deep book but it still contains enough action to keep you satisfied. Erikson has been criticized by his lack of characterization, but I was able to get a good sense of each person even though he supplies sparse details. He give a rough outline and leaves it up to the reader to fill in the blanks and I commend him for that. <br /> <br />My biggest criticism of the book is that there are too many characters to follow and that the story tend to jump around each characters viewpoint. The jumping around doesn't occur within a single scene, but shifts from scene to scene. This was annoying at first, but once I got the pattern it became forgivable. <br /> <br />I had to work to enjoy this book. I found myself looking back in the book to remind myself of who each character was. I would have preferred that he limit the character viewpoints and give us more time to get to know each before moving on to another. <br /> <br />As casual reading I would not recommend this book, but hard core fantasy fans should enjoy it. I consider it more R.E. Howard than J.R.R. Tolkien. <br /> <br />Much better than Robert Jordan by far.
B000O174CM|5.0|Simply stated - this movie, this musical, bowled me over and completely enveloped me in its acting, its production value and its music.  In my opinion, Dreamgirls creators have done the impossible - they have taken an award winning Broadway musical and made it better than the Broadway show that it was based upon.<br /><br />The production on screen allowed for a more complete telling of the story behind these women, their successes and their fears.  Success in this movie is directly associated with sacrifice - what will these women surrounder to in order to get the dream they want and what will it take for them to claim control over their lives in order to fulfill their destinies.<br /><br />There are however three production issues that could have been done differently that would have more firmly knitted the music to the storyline:<br /><br />* First, Beyonce's \\"Listen\\" number was misplaced in a recording studio; its should have played out that evening when she told Curtis she was leaving.<br /><br />* Secondly, Effie should have received another number - and expansion of \\"Effie White is Going to Win\\" in Curtis' office.<br /><br />* Finally, the producers should have addressed the most blatant oversight - a musical number for Lorelle.  It appeared in the stage version and was cut from th script or the film.  Anika Noni Rose did an outstanding job in her role, and the lack of a solo hurt her chances at the recognition that she should have received.<br /><br />Finally, after you see this movie you need to listen to the soundtrack and see how well the songs express the drama.  \\"And I'm Telling You\\" is NOT the best song in the movie.  That honor belongs to \\"I am Changing\\"  The unsettling \\"We Are Family\\" is meant to stop the story, send a double message, and set the stage for Effie's impending removal from the group.  It works if you understand it, otherwise it feels misplaced.<br /><br />The message of the movie is that everyone has dreams, and that those dreams can come true if you seize your destiny and make those dreams come true for yourself.hose dreams can come true if you seize your destiny and make those dreams come true for yourself.
B000N6TX1I|3.0|\\"Children of Men\\" is based on P.D. James' dystopian novel set in the year 2027, where all women have been mysteriously infertile for 18 years. This world without children has deteriorated into chaos, ostensibly because there is little reason to maintain our infrastructures or composure if humans have no future. While the rest of the world wages perpetual anarchic war, Great Britain musters on, its government and industry still functioning. Refugees who have escaped violence on other continents stream into Britain illegally, where the authorities do their best to contain the immigrants in camps and shanty towns. Theo Faron (Clive Owen), a middle-aged bureaucrat, is kidnapped on the streets of London by a revolutionary immigrant-rights group calling itself \\"The Fishes\\". Their leader is Theo's ex-wife Julian Taylor (Julianne Moore). who implores Theo to help her obtain transit papers for a young woman named Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) who desperately needs to reach the coast.<br /><br />Julianne Moore's strong presence is the only thing that \\"Children of Men\\" has to recommend it. We don't see enough of her, and the rest of the film is completely forgettable. Too dull to be an action movie and too shallow to be anything else, \\"Children of Men\\" spends most of its energy wallowing in bleak, bluish, squalor. The production design draws attention to itself in every frame without ever managing to captivate. Squalor seems to be the principal theme. \\"Children of Men\\" is a chase movie, in which the characters are running away from one thing and toward another. That's fine for an action movie, but the action here consists simply of running or driving away from gunfire. The characters are woefully underwritten and the story simplistic. Oddly, \\"Children of Men\\" expresses its agenda in the background. Literally. The mistreatment of immigrants in the background of so many scenes conveys what are presumably director Alfonso Cuaron's views on immigration and open borders.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2007): Bonus features include deleted  scenes and 6 featurettes. \\"The Possibility of Hope\\" (26 min) are various doomsday predictions by social philosophers of the far left persuasion. In \\"Children of Men Comments by Slavoj Zizek\\" (6 min), social critic Zizek talks about what he sees as the true focus of the film, that being social oppression in capitalist systems. \\"Under Attack\\" ( 7 min) discusses the film's very long takes, with analysis of the opening sequence and  the car action sequence. \\"Theo & Julian\\" (5 min) discusses the characters. \\"Futuristic Design\\" (8 min) talks with set designer Jennifer Williams and production designer Jim Clay about creating the disintegrating society. \\"Visual Effects: Creating the Baby\\" (3 min) shows us how the baby delivery scene was created, including animating the baby.

B000003TAL|5.0|This is INCREDIBLE work to say the least. An '80s Alterna-\\"indie\\"-Rock staple. Sonic Youth is MUCH MORE than your average experimental noise underground (at the time) Rock 'n' Roll band. Daydream Nation VAULTED Sonic Youth: Thurston Moore, Kim Gordon, Lee Ranaldo, & Steve Shelley to a NEW level of recognition as pioneers of Rock n Roll past and original trailblazers in a dawn of a new beginning. Basically the album that made Sonic Youth famous, while still being in N.Y.s indie music scene.<br />Originally released in 1988, Daydream Nation is Sonic Youth's sixth studio release, containing an album's worth of their coolest breezy, energetic songs and stretching Rock to far unreachable heights.<br />S.Y. brought their sound into the mainstream, influencing hundreds of bands including Nirvana. My Favorite songs on Daydream Nation: Opener \\"Teen Age Riot\\" - \\"Silver Rocket\\" - \\"The Sprawl\\" - 'Cross the Breeze\\" - \\"Hey Joni\\" - \\"Candle\\" -contains a reference to \\"Tonight's The Night\\"(1975) by Neil Young w/ line: \\"It's safe to say, Candle, TONIGHT'S the DAY -Candle, It's alright now candle, the wind's away-Candle. Never thought I'd see a dark sky falling.....\\"<br />I sometimes wonder in what state \\"Alternative\\" music would be in without Sonic Youth. They changed and shifted the landscape's sound into a more radical, apocalyptic state.  And who would of thought they would go on so many years, as of now 25+ & 18(+)-(there are a lot of side projects); albums or so, some are better than others and I own all studio albums.<br />In 1990 Sonic Youth released Goo (their 7th) their first for major-label DGC, to reach a wider more appreciative audience. And in 1991 Nirvana followed going to major label DGC and igniting the \\"grunge\\" movement in the mainstream. But, believe me Daydream Nation (NOT Goo) has GAINED my attention as well as thousands(+) more! One SERIOUS Record.<br />Another one of my ALL TIME favorites. It is also cited as making a vast array of \\"greatest albums of all time\\" lists(quoted from double album re-issue including live 2nd disc).<br />To me, this is the best 80s album I have ever heard and Sonic Youth's absolute Best.uble album re-issue including live 2nd disc).

0374105235|4.0|A Long Way Gone begins this way:<br /><br />  My high school friends have begun to suspect I haven't told them the full story of my life. \\"Why did you leave Sierra Leone?\\" \\"Because there is a war.\\" \\"Did you witness some of the fighting?\\" \\"Everyone in the country did.\\" \\"You mean, you saw people running around with guns and shooting each other?\\" \\"Yes, all the time.\\" \\"Cool.\\" I smile a little. \\"You should tell us about it sometime.\\" \\"Yes, sometime.\\"<br /><br />In this book, that has spent a couple of months near the top of the New York Times list of bestsellers, Ishmael Beah tells about it. When he was only twelve, with his country of Sierra Leone thrown into a long and bloody civil war, his village was attacked by rebels. He was forced to run for his life knowing that if he was caught he would be forced, upon pain of death, to join the rebel army. For months he and his friends ran, successfully evading the rebels as they systematically destroyed the nation, raping, pillaging and murdering indiscriminately.<br /><br />Eventually Beah found himself in a village controlled by the national army. He thought he was safe here, but they soon compelled him to fight for them, despite his young age. Fueled by hatred towards those who had harmed his family and driven him from his home, he readily joined the cause. For over two years he fought for this army, participating in countless battles and skirmishes. He became a cold-blooded killer, killing, torturing and maiming. He was supplied with endless amounts of marijuana and cocaine and lived these years in a constant drug-induced haze. Though he began fighting on what he felt was the good side, he soon found himself descending further and further into moral decay so that he felt nothing, even when he looked into the eyes of men whose throats he was cutting.<br /><br />The book takes a somewhat unexpected turn when Beah is suddenly handed over to UNICEF for rehabilitation. In one day he goes from being a soldier in the forests of Sierra Leone and the next he is taken to a rehabilitation center in Freetown. He slowly and painfully recovers from his drug addiction and is reintegrated into society. Though he was \\"a long way gone,\\" he is able to recover his humanity, though only with much time and patience. The story comes to an ending that is disappointing for its abruptness and leaves the reader with many unanswered questions.<br /><br />It is a moving story and a terrifying one for it plainly displays the senseless depravity of human beings and the depths we can fall to. It shows how even a nice young man can be so easily reduced to a killer. While Beah was blessed to be able to eventually escape the controls of the military and to escape to the United States, some 300,000 child soldiers remain in combat around the world.<br /><br />There were at least two aspects of this book that gave me much to ponder. The first dealt with moral culpability in situations like Beah's. How much responsibility does a person like this bear for his actions? He was just a young boy when he was forced into drug addiction and, while under the influence of narcotics, to commit horrifying atrocities. Does he bear the same responsibility as if he had done all this as an adult who was not under the influence of narcotics and under the influence of bloodthirsty leaders? The second aspect, related to this, dealt with Beah's recovery. When he was in the rehabilitation center he would be told constantly, \\"It's not your fault.\\" Yet this answer infuriated him so that he would plug his ears rather than having to hear it again. It seems that he somehow wanted to be able to take responsibility for his actions but that the people who rehabilitated him would not hear of this. The book does not go into as much detail as I would have liked about his psychological or spiritual recovery. The cover mentions that he had to learn how to forgive himself, but this does not seem to factor into the narrative. What I hope for this young author (who is still only twenty six) is that he will be able to assume responsibility for his sinful actions and seek true forgiveness from the One who is both willing and able to provide it. This will surely mark his deepest and most important recovery. Only in the Bible will he find a clear explanation as to how he could be so easily swayed by sin and only in the Bible will he find the hope of forgiveness.<br /><br />A Long Way Gone is an important book and one that is well worth reading. It shakes the foundations of those of us who live in a part of the world that is so safe and where we are so sheltered. It inspires gratitude that we have escaped such pain and hopefully inspires action that peace may come to nations where young boys are still drafted into service as ruthless, cold-hearted killers.his young author (who is still only twenty six) is that he will be able to assume responsibility for his sinful actions and seek true forgiveness from the One who is both willing and able to provide it.

B00003CXD0|5.0|I saw this movie when it came out in the 80s and loved it. I hadn't seen it in years and have a 15 year old son now, so I bought it to share with him. He laughed all the way through it as I still do. Tootsie never ages- fun and entertaining then and now.

B000005IU2|5.0|The sound of FUN HOUSE never gets old. The Stooges 2nd album, Fun House, was first released in 1970. They sound so much more ALIVE w/ POWER and agitated aggression, than on their debut self-titled release in 1969.  FUNHOUSE is just mind blowing Sure-fire in your face ferocity!<br />On the front cover of the album it looks like Iggy is basking in the flames of Hell and the music portrays such a passionate deep, fiery kind of mess and rage.<br />Don Gallucci was FUNHOUSE's producer and directed the band members to capture the intensity felt from The Stooges live shows; and showcase it in the studio. What resulted from the studio sessions brought out a much more maniacal side to Iggy Pop, it just sounds like he was having so much fun making this album. JAZZ fused w/ Blues and Punk attitude all around.<br />Unfortunately in 1970, the majority record buying public wasn't interested in The Stooges or FUNHOUSE. They felt it's Hellish nature depicted a darker world of sex and drugs. I guess it was just ahead of it's time.<br />My favorite songs are: \\"Loose\\" - \\"1970\\" - & \\"Funhouse\\" - I do prefer RAW POWER's(Stooges 3rd album)version of \\"Dirt\\" better than the FUNHOUSE one.<br />The Stooges along w/ Iggy Pop and their three albums did inspire a lot of artists. Thanks to Iggy Pop's vision he influenced the proto-punks in London as well as New York. Such influence can be seen on Sonic Youth's earlier work: Confusion is Sex(their second full-length)<br />The Stooges also directly influenced Black Flag, Richard Hell, The Birthday Party, & in the later '80s, one of my Favorites - Mudhoney.<br />Rage Against the Machine - covered the opening track on FUNHOUSE -\\"Down On the Street,\\" for their last album 2000s Renegades.<br />To Me FUNHOUSE sounds fresh even after the 37 years it has been released! And Rolling Stone named it one of the TOP 500 albums of ALL TIME(191)!<br /><br />Yep - I give it 5 stars!
B00004XPPC|5.0|Classic movie and glad it finally came on DVD
055357342X|4.0|Wow, axes fall all over the place in this one. It's no secret that in a Martin novel no character is given a free pass to survival, but I was amazed by how many went down in this one. Jaw dropping, really, and brave of the author. <br /> <br />That's the first thing that comes to mind, but there's a lot of other great stuff about this book. I still have my favorite characters - I think everybody does - and that's a lot of what kept me turning the pages. Jon Snow's stuff is particularly good. He's beyond the wall and in love and torn about it. And then the seige on the wall is just amazing, finally giving us those promised giants and mammoths for real. In early novels, I'd thought that Martin skimped a bit on the battle scenes. Not so in the one. He makes the wall itself awesome and brings the battle to life with vigor. <br /> <br />Tyrion is a lot of fun, as always. But Daenarys is my other big favorite. I love the way she's developing, and I love that's she's got brains enough to pull off some major victories - unlike Arya and Sansa. And Jaime is quite interesting as well. He's strangely sympathetic, although with all the stuff that happens to him he deserves some sympathy. <br /> <br />Anyway, hell of a book, hell of a series. I'm a little worried about A Feast For Crows, considering what I've heard about it. But I'll probably give it a try before long. There's still so much promised to come. I'm fairly hooked.
B000FQJAIW|3.0|It is certainly too bad that Lucas has decided to treat the 1977 version of Star Wars with such low regard, especially considering the fact that it was those of us that showed up to the theaters in droves to see this film thirty years ago that made his \\"empire\\" what it became. All I wanted was to see the exact scenes in the exact sequence that I saw them in back in 1977 with the same hokie sound effects, men running around in rubber costumes portraying all of the various creatures, and poorly rendered graphics. After all, that is all part of the nostalgia, and the nostalgia is all part of the fun. However, I did expect to see the film at least \\"cleaned up\\" from an audio and visual perspective, and that I did not get. As for the 2004 edition, that feature gets the royal treatment, but you have to put up with the infamous altering of Han's shootout with Greedo, as well as all of the added scenes, including digitally added dinosaur-like creatures that were considered state-of-the art when Jurassic Park came out 16 years after this movie was made. Neither makes for a satisfying film viewing experience for an oldster such as myself with a preconceived notion of what I want to see.<br /><br />Apparently, the fact that these double-feature releases of the original Star Wars trilogy haven't sold well has us in a circular argument with its creator. You see, fewer people than expected have bought this set, since they are waiting for the 9-disc Ultimate Star Wars Saga to come out in a boxed set. However, Lucas is now determined to hold off putting out the trilogy boxed set for that very reason. Due to poor sales of this set he now intends to wait until 2008 or 2009 to release the long-awaited trilogy boxed set. The information in this last paragraph comes from the Feb. 23 post at The Rumor Mill of digitalbits, so it is still, after all, just a rumor. At any rate, something has to be done to stop Lucas from continuing to be the Darth Vader of digital editing. I really don't believe this business about Lucas' vision continuing to drive him to tinker - or not tinker - with these films. I think the original success of Star Wars surprised Lucas as much as anyone. After all, the original commercials for Star Wars back in 1977 said \\"This summer see Star Wars ... just for the fun of it\\".is business about Lucas' vision continuing to drive him to tinker - or not tinker - with these films.

B000N6TX1I|5.0|Children of Men is one of those movies that I really wanted to see in the theater but didn't actually catch until it came out on DVD. I was blown away by this incredible movie and would even say it was one of the best movies of last year. There's a reason this movie was nominated for its cinematography and editing and you can see it in every beautifully framed shot. <br /> <br />The movie centers on Theo (Clive Owen), a man who has lost his family and only floats along now in the nightmare the world has become since children can no longer be conceived and everything has turned to chaos. It's not until  his estranged wife, who is the leader of an extremist group, contacts him for help in getting a young woman who is pregnant out of the country. Though reluctant at first, Theo decides to help and becomes caught up in an electrifying race against time, filled with incredible action sequences, back-stabbing and a small glimmer of hope for the future. <br /> <br />The movie excels at everything it tries to accomplish. The story and plot move along briskly. The acting is top notch, with Clive Owen being the most notable. He continues to impress me with his roles and acting. Alfonso's vision of a destroyed future world is perfect and the sets are great. If you're a true fan of film and pay attention to how movies are shot, the action scenes alone will make you fall in love with this movie. During the big action scenes Alfonso doesn't make a single cut. You'll see people being shot, entire car chases with fire and mobs, running out of exploding buildings and through buses as a war rages in the background. It's some amazing stuff that'll blow your mind. <br /> <br />Like I said, this movie is amazing. It's thought provoking, well acted and filmed. I have only good things to say about it. Word of warning though: this movie is bleak and has a lot of heart breaking moments in it. It doesn't end all neat and tidy and it doesn't explain everything either. This movie makes you think, although it does offer a slim glimmer of hope at the end.
B000GRUMPU|2.0|I love a good action movie.  Love them.  So what weent wrong?  Well, the effects were there, but it all seemed so detached.  We may have seen most of the action sequences you can do on a ship previously, or we may not.  Bottom line is this:  if you are going to have an action sequence, make it exciting.  Watching the DVD of this, I wasn't able to be drawn in sufficiently to keep me from checking my email.  At less than 100 minutes in length.<br /><br />A boring action movie is just plain wrong, and that's what Poseidon is.

0226264211|3.0|\\"Capitalism and Freedom\\" is one of a series of books that Milton Friedman wrote with a more general audience in mind, as part of his battle against the pre-1980 economics consensus.  Freidman was a believer in freedom, and to him, the free market was an essential part in ensuring that freedom.  Today, his beliefs form the basis of most non-Marxist economic theory.  Yet, when he wrote \\"Capitalism and Freedom\\", the consensus view following World Wars and economic disasters was that government intervention in the economy was not only beneficial, but was necessary.  The world had seemed too complex, to uncertain for anything other than a heavily taxed and heavily regulated economy.  The only disagreement was over the level of government intervention - a Keynesian state, an economy heavily directed by a Galbreaithian \\"new class\\" or a Marxian economy where the role of the private sector was practically non-existent.<br /><br />Milton Friedman was one of a band of economists who challenged these views, not only in economics faculty lounges, but, more importantly, in the court of public opinion.<br /><br />While this book is well written and persuasive, it is not as relevant today as some of his other works.  This book was written at a time of a very different economy.  For example, the book spends much time discussing the effect of the gold standard on economics and trade, something which has no relevance today.<br /><br />In short, read the book for its historic value.  If you want a Friedman book that is relevant for today, read \\"Free to Choose.\\"
B000002IAS|5.0|DELANEY & BONNIE ON TOUR WITH ERIC CLAPTON is Delaney & Bonnie's crowning achievement, as well as one of Eric Clapton's best performances ever. This album features the musicians who would later make up Joe Cocker's Mad Dogs & Englishmen troupe, and the performances are a loose blend of blues, soul, R&B, rock, gospel, and funk. The best song here is \\"Coming Home\\", which also happened to be the single that was released. This CD will be well appreciated by anyone who loves Clapton, Leon Russell, Joe Cocker, and/or the Allman Brothers Band.

0486274268|5.0|This book is somewhere right between a \\"How to Draw Animals\\" book and a detailed anatomy book. It gives you the basics of the muscles for each animal in beautiful, dynamic sketches that take you from drawing static (but proportional) animals to leaping, rolling, fighting animals. If you're really serious, you'll still need a more detailed anatomy book, but for movement (especially of horses and deer and their running patterns) this one is awesome. Just a warning though, the section on dogs is awesome but smaller than the horses, the section on cats is extensive but focuses mostly on big cats, and the section on wolves/foxes/wild dogs is pretty brief - much more of the book is spent on the larger herbivores and some less commonly studied animals like kangaroos, camels, rabbits, and a big section on bears.
B00008J2PG|5.0|Fr. O'Flaherty's activities in World War II Rome, helping Italian Jews and escaped Allied POW's was very much real, motivated by a sense of human decency.  But the movie goes beyond the stereotype of heroes resisting and evading evil Nazis--when the tide of war turns and the Nazis are on the run, the SS intelligence chief, Col. Kappler turns to Father O'Flaherty for help!  (This did in fact happen in reality--Fr. O'Flaherty routinely visited Col. Kappler when he was imprisoned and the SS colonel eventually became a devout Catholic, thanks in part to Fr. O'Flaherty's influence.)  The message of the movie, about forgiveness and redemption, as well as altruism and courage, is highly relevant in this day and age that demands absolute heroes and absolute villains.
B000JFDBXO|1.0|I loved the 1st two X-Men movies, and was very excited about the 3rd one. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations. Several of my favorite characters were missing or underused (Mystique, NightCrawler, Rogue). Why bring back Jean Grey? Her resurrection added nothing to the storyline IMO. New characters didn't add much either (Angel & Beast). The story could have been interesting with better writing and character development, but I found it mostly boring, needlessly convoluted, and full of loose ends.

0140177396|5.0|Undoubtedly one of the finest works to come out of 20th Century America, John Steinbeck's celebrated classic remains one of the best things you'll ever read, period.  We all know the story by now: George and the dim-witted but well-meaning Lennie are making their way across the American wasteland in pursuit of a dream.  Naturally, things end up taking a wrong turn, with some very tough decisions to be made for almost everyone involved.  Steinbeck's story still packs a punch, and the interplay between George and Lennie is arguably some of the best written dialogue between two characters, well, ever.  The subtlety of Steinbeck's themes are wonderfully understated, and the final act is one of the most haunting scenes you'll ever read.  That being said, if you've never read Of Mice and Men, you have been missing out.  There is a reason that this book is revered as much as it is.  Of Mice and Men is a masterpiece of classic American literature that everyone should read, and by the time the book gets going, you won't be able to put it down.

The adaptation of the novel for this screen play is far superior to any other, and the film much more closely adheres to the original.

1416914285|5.0|After getting the book on Friday, I was finally able to sit down on Sunday and read it. I ended up staying up all night to read it, well at least until 5:00am, and was late to work because of it. I am normally able to put a book down and finish reading it later, but I didn't want to put City of Bones down. I can't even remember the last time I've sat and read a book straight through. I didn't have the luxury to read OotP in one sitting, and didn't care to for HBP. <br />  <br />The world you created was very richly detailed and I loved every word of it. Obviously, as in all books of a similar genre I noticed common themes. But if anyone looked hard enough they could and would find a common theme in any two books. The characters were amazing. Everyone seems clearly defined, although we learn more about each of the characters as we go along. You didn't really leave me screaming into the abyss, \\"What about this??\\" about any of them.  <br />  <br />I loved the twist about Alec. That was a risky thing to do, but I really think it serves the story well. Simon is great, but I couldn't help myself for falling for Jace. He's like a Draco that was never bad. I'll admit, I don't like the wrench you threw us about him, but did see it coming. I am still going to hold out hope that maybe it's not all as it seems. :-)  <br />  <br />I love Clary. She seems like a typical mundane, but she's got shadowhunter in her blood and some reflexes and talents you're just born with. Luke's condition was a surprise. As was (...) turning against them, but really, there's always got to be a traitor, yeah?  <br />  <br />I can't wait until the next book comes out. I am probably going to have read City of Bones many more times before that happens, so I'm looking forward to learning/remembering even more about these wonderful characters and this wonderful story you've created for us!  <br />  <br />I've been hooked since I read the first teaser chapter on your website, and throughout City of Bones,you've definately reeled me in. There's no escaping now; only waiting in the tank for dinner! hehe  <br />  <br />Thank you so much for sharing your amazing talent and imagination with us 'mundanes'!  <br />  <br />A dedicated fan...
075640407X|5.0|This book ranks as one of  my new favorites, I will be waiting for the hour Day Two comes out to buy the book for my library. Patrick Rothfuss has rolled together all the fantasy elements I love to read about and added frosting (Chocolate flavored - with those little tidbits of colored candy sprinkles thrown in). I'm not going to list details - if you're not convinced by all the great reviews, mine sure won't do it for you. However, I will state that if you don't at least pick it up and read it you will be missing out on a great read! <br /> <br />I had this book read in a day, I didn't put it down until three am (a habit I haven't had since my college days) and I enjoyed every minute of the ride. The only disappointment I had was when I reached the end and remembered that the next book isn't released yet. I find it difficult to believe Mr. Rothfuss is a 1st time author and I will be waiting with bated breath for more from him!
B00005JPMC|4.0|I personally liked the film.  Good plot. Good acting.  Mark Walburg is definitely honing his craft.  Definitely feels like a Democrat wrote the script, but, nevertheless I looked past that and went for the movie as a whole because the message was blatently clear what it was trying to convey.  But, it still was a good movie.  This reminded me of Tom Berenger's \\"Sniper\\" movie.  I like that movie as well.  So, I recommend that movie as well.  I noticed the customers tagged this movie as \\"leftist propaganda\\" and they're very correct.  However, as a neutral movie viewer it was a good movie.  And besides, no matter what party you belong to, there are bad people on both sides.  No one party is better than the other in my opinion.
0201626632|5.0|I am currently finishing my Ph.D. study. I thought that it is too late to read this book. However, it is NOT! Based my own experience, the descriptions of Ph.D. study in the book are really accurate and the suggestions given by the author are really helpful. <br /> <br />It is never too late to read this book, strong buy!
B00006RU5B|5.0|no better in the industry right now, unless they steal chris cornell.  absolutely great cd - waiting for the next album...
B000FQ4M58|4.0|This is a fantastic recording  if anybody can combine opera rock and heavy metal it is Meatloaf The stand out tracks are Blind as a bat, Alive, If god could talk. In my opinion this is Better Then Bat out of hell 2 . It would be foolish to compare it to The original bat out of hell as that record was done 30 years ago !!! However it comes a close 2nd in quality
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|I love this CD If you Like Hugh Grant you will love this CD
0439813786|5.0|When the book arrived, my 8 y.o. snatched it from the box, found a cozy spot under the dining room table and proceeded to get lost in the book.  She re-emerged 90 minutes later - thrilled with the story and illustrations.  The text and drawings are balanced in a way that the book doesn't feel like a \\"picture book\\", but is not so overwhelming to a reader who is still developing fluency.  Plus, the book size is very impressive (especially to an 8 y.o.).
B00000ICD9|1.0|I waited for this movie to transcend the pretentious, derivitive visuals especially the awful artwork but it ended up being just as bad.  I read some of the reviews and the comments are consistently favorable of the visuals even if they did not like the movie.  The only way I can understand this is by also seeing that somehow the awful art of Thomas Kinkade is so popular.  It is so marketed and fake, served to you as great art.  That is exactly how this movie has been served to you, don't accept it find something real.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|I attempted to watch this movie a while back, and couldnt, I fell asleep.  I wrote it off to an over-hyped movie, with no merrit.  I couldnt have been more wrong.  I watched it again this weekend, and this movie is fantastic.  I wouldnt change anything.  I read some of the other reviews on here criticizing this film for excessive use of bad language, etc...well, having lived in Boston for a long time, and spending quite a bit of time in Southie, the excessive use of foul language is appropriate since this how all the locals talk.  Trust me.  Spend five minutes in Southie by walking up Broadway, or taking a cab down Dorcester, and you will understand.<br /><br />I thought the acting was all in all pretty good, and the plot twists, were keep you on the edge of your seat type caliber...I still dont understand fully the last scene, or which side of the fence Mark Wahlbergs (sp?) falls on, but who cares...fodder for debate over beer with friends.
B000NA1VIW|5.0|Truth up front: I was getting sick of the over-the-top camp of the last several Bond flicks, and I love a good caper film.  Daniel Craig has blown me away in both of his roles in this package, and when I saw it bundled it was an instant buy.  \\"Casino Royale\\" is in my opinion one of the best Bond movies, period, and a refreshing change of pace for the series.  \\"Layer Cake\\" is just a fun, well-written caper flick, with an interesting little twist that you probably don't realize until the very end.  It's not Oscar material, but it is a heck of a lot of fun, and I recommend it to anyone who loves the genre.  This pairing is great; I think if you liked either movie in it, you'll enjoy its partner.  Get it today!
006085880X|5.0|This is without a doubt one of Picoult's better works.  While I have yet to come across a truly \\"bad\\" book she had authored, there necessarily exists a continuum of any corpus that classifies some works as better than others - this is certainly a `better' one. <br /> <br />While much of the setting is similar to her other novels, a significant courtroom drama with twists and turns in the testimonies, love stories, complex characters tangled in varying emotions, the topic is a curious one that truly wrenches the heart.  Love, past pain and abuse, adolescence and family relationships frame the story of a young teenage couple who grew up next door and were inseparable their entire lives.  Both sets of parents were the closest of friends and all seemed fairy-tale like.  Until both sets of parents are called to a hospital late one evening to discover one child dead, the other wounded and pieces of a story missing amid conflicting evidence.  Was this event an unfinished suicide pact or a murder?   <br /> <br />Using her usual \\"then\\" and \\"now\\" approach to develop the story and establish background, the reader oscillates between an ensuing trial and the establishment of all that led to this point.  A wonderfully written and thought-out story that captures the heart and imagination.  With a few surprise turns at the end of the book, you will be left breathless as you round the final corner of the storyline.  Read this book today!
0937381888|5.0|This is the book to have. I started out with the Joy of Homebrewing and didn't realize how much brewing has progressed.  It wasn't until I got this book (6 batches into brewing) that I learned that I was oxidizing my wort instead of aerating it, and why my attenuation rates just weren't getting to where they were supposed to be.   <br />I also really like John's style of writing; chapters simple enough to get started and others detailed enough to give the brewmeister too much to think about.  If you like your brewing information straight-forward, well thought out and completely explained, then this is the book you want.
0743454537|5.0|Having read about half a dozen Picoult novels, I have come to both appreciate and be critically aware of he style and predictable character developments.  I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by this book.  While much of her other work resembles previous styles, this one is unique in both style and characterization.   <br /> <br />A story that focuses on a family struggling with keeping a life together that is attacked from all fronts by situations in the lives of each of the three children.  Jessie, the oldest, is a rebellious and mischievous teenager with a proclivity for getting into trouble; Kate, the middle, is a girl who has struggled her whole life with a rare form of leukemia which strains the energy and life of the family the most; and Anna, the baby, was conceived with the design for and intent of providing the necessary biological material that needed to be donated to sustain Kate's life.  Anna, 13, files a petition in court to be given the right to make her own medical decisions in order to not have to give a kidney to her sister at her parent's insistence.   <br /> <br />The story changes perspective in every chapter, providing the reader with an insider's perspective on the thoughts, experiences and memories of each of the main characters.  This is very well done.  The only downside, in my opinion, is the change of font with each change in narrator.  It is a bit distracting, but eventually becomes overlooked.   <br /> <br />You will be taken on a roller-coaster ride of emotions as you love-hate-love-hate each character and reach a surprising climactic end.  Wonderfully written, this is a must-read novel!
B000MNP2KI|1.0|NOTE: I'm rating the DVD itself, not the movie on it. The movie is incredible - easily the best, most realistic, most believable 007 ever. The movie gets a 5 out of 5 in all areas.<br /><br />But the DVD... ugh. I suspect Sony, in trying to push yet another proprietary format - Blu-Ray in this case - purposely degraded the picture and sound quality of this standard-definition DVD. The picture is grainy and slightly out-of-focus throughout. The sound is muffled, as if the sound engineer cranked up the mid-bass and turned down the treble, making vocals nearly unintelligible.<br /><br />When I first played this on my system (Westinghouse HDTV, Sony SD DVD player, Denon 5/6/7-channel receiver, Bose speaker system), I thought I was losing my mind. As a sanity check, I watched \\"The Full Monty,\\" a 10-year-old low-budget independent film: it looked good and sounded great. I then tried the previous Bond film from 4 years ago, \\"Die Another Day\\" (which was *not* a Sony picture). The result: AMAZING picture and sound!<br /><br />So beware - this DVD is, in my observation and opinion, INTENTIONALLY FLAWED. I now hope HD DVD wipes the floor with Blu-Ray, and that this amazing film is re-released - without sour grapes - in that high-def format.
B000784WMW|5.0|1983's \\"Jane Eyre,\\" in spite of its technical flaws, brought the magic back to me of reading \\"Jane Eyre\\" for the first time.<br /><br />I felt duty bound to watch the 1983 Timothy Dalton / Zelah Clarke adaptation of \\"Jane Eyre,\\" because I'd just written an article about the 2006 BBC \\"Jane Eyre\\" for TheScreamOnline. So, I approached watching this the way I'd approach doing homework.<br /><br />I was irritated at first. The lighting in this version is bad. Everyone / everything is washed out in a bright white klieg light that, in some scenes, casts shadows on the wall behind the characters.<br /><br />And the sound is poorly recorded. I felt like I was listening to a high school play.<br /><br />And the pancake make-up is way too heavy.<br /><br />And the sets don't fully convey the Gothic mood of the novel. I just can't see Bronte's Rochester abiding such Martha Stewart domestic arrangements. Orson Welles' Rochester lived in cave-like gloom, very appropriate to the novel's Gothic mood.<br /><br />And yet ... with all those objections ... not only is this the best \\"Jane Eyre\\" I've seen, it may be the best adaptation of any novel I've ever seen.<br /><br />The critics of this production say it is too close to the book. For me, someone who valued the book and didn't need it to be any less \\"wordy\\" or any less \\"Christian\\" or any more sexed-up, this version's faithfulness to the novel Bronte actually wrote is its finest asset.<br /><br />Bronte wrote a darn good book. There's a reason it has lasted 150 years plus, while other, slicker, sexier and easier texts, have disappeared.<br /><br />As a long time \\"Jane Eyre\\" fan, I was prejudiced against Timothy Dalton as Rochester. Rochester is, famously, not handsome; Jane and Rochester are literature's famous ugly couple. And Timothy Dalton is nothing if not stunningly handsome.<br /><br />But Dalton gives a mesmerizing performance as Rochester. He just blew me away. I've never seen anything like his utter devotion to the role, the text, the dialogue, and Rochester's love for Jane. Dalton brings the page's Rochester to quivering life on screen.<br /><br />Rochester is meant to be a bit scary. Dalton is scary. Welles got the scary streak down, too, for example, when he shouts \\"Enough!\\" after Fontaine plays a short piano piece. But Dalton is scary more than once, here. You really can't tell if he's going to hurt Jane, or himself, in his desperation.<br /><br />Rochester's imperiousness, his humor, his rage, his vulnerability: Dalton conveys all, sometimes seconds apart. It's stunning.<br /><br />And here's the key thing -- the actor performing Rochester has to convey that he has spent over a decade of his life in utter despair, lonely, living with an ugly, life-destroying secret.<br /><br />No other actor I've seen attempt this part conveys that black hole of despair as Timothy Dalton does. Current fan-favorite Toby Stephens doesn't even try. Dalton hits it out of the park. If I saw Timothy Dalton performing Rochester in a singles bar, i would say, \\"That guy is trouble. Don't even look at him.\\" He's that radioactive with tamped down agony.<br /><br />Zelah Clarke is not only, overall, the best Jane I've seen, she's one of the very few Janes whom producers were willing to cast as the book casts Jane. No, folks who know \\"Jane Eyre\\" only from the 2006 BBC version, Bronte did *not* describe a statuesque, robust Jane with finely arched eyebrows and pouty lips. Rather, Charlotte Bronte's Jane is, indeed, poor, plain, obscure, and little, and NOT pretty.<br /><br />Zelah has a small mouth, close-set eyes, and a bit of a nose. She's truly \\"little.\\" She is no fashion model. And she is the best Jane, the truest to the book.<br /><br />Some described her a cold or boring. No, she's true to the book. Bronte's Jane is not a red hot mama, she's a sheltered, deprived teen whose inner passions come out only at key moments, as Zelah's do here. The book's Jane is someone you have to watch slowly, carefully, patiently, observantly, if you want to truly plumb her depths. You have to watch Zelah, here, to get to know who she really is.<br /><br />I would have liked to have seen more fire in Zelah in one key scene, but that's one scene out of five hours in which she is, otherwise, very good.<br /><br />In spite of its closeness to the text, this version, like every other version I've seen, shys away from fully explicating the overtly Christian themes in \\"Jane Eyre.\\" Christianity is not incidental subtext in \\"Jane Eyre,\\" it is central.<br /><br />Helen Burns instructs Jane in Christianity, thus giving her a subversive, counter cultural way to read, and live, her apparently doomed, pinched life. It is Christianity, and a Christian God, who convinces poor, plain, obscure Jane of her equal worth, her need to live up to her ideals, and her rejection of a key marriage proposal. That isn't made fully clear here.<br /><br />In any case, Charlotte Bronte wrote an excellent, complex, rich novel, and this adaptation of it, of all the ones I've seen, mines and honors the novel best of any adaptation I've seen, and that says a lot.<br /><br />Other versions, that don't fully honor the book, end up being a chore to watch in many places. If you don't care about what Charlotte Bronte has to say about child abuse, or the hypocrisy of a culture built on looks and money, your adaptation of much of the book will be something people fast forward through to get to the kissing scenes between Jane and Rochester.<br /><br />This version, like Bronte's novel, realizes that everything Bronte wrote -- about Jane's experiences at Lowood, and her relationship to St. John -- are part of what makes Jane's relationship to Rochester as explosive and unforgettable as it is.ave to watch slowly, carefully, patiently, observantly, if you want to truly plumb her depths.

0156528207|1.0|I popped in to a bookstore to buy this book and noticed that it was a new translation. New translation?  Fortunately I had the foresight to thumb  through it.  I promptly left it behind and went straight to a second hand bookstore to buy a copy of the original translation.  How could the publisher eliminate the wonderful poetic language?  I read The Little Prince as a child ( which by the way wasn't so long ago)  and I loved the language.  Antoine De Saint-Exupery's work is all about painting pictures through language.  This watered down mess is no better than an edition of Cliff Notes.   I actually apologize to Cliff Notes.  At least with Cliff  Notes would have explained the intention and nature  of the language.   I am sorry to see that this publisher allowed  the dumbing down of this beautiful classic.
0792844890|5.0|For those of us whom grew up with Battlestar Galactica and the mother of all sci-fi movies - \\"Star Wars\\", this is an affectionate and hilarious spoof of the sci-fi genre. It's ludicrously funny and gross at the same time. The best casting was in Rick Moranis as \\"Dark Helmet\\" and the scene where he plays with his dolls is hysterical. The double entendres keep you rolling in your seats. It's not Mel's best work - \\"Blazing Saddles\\" and \\"Young Frankenstein\\", but it will really strike a nerve with sci-fi lovers. I especially loved the rip-off scene from \\"Aliens\\". Let's go to ludicrous speed!
B000LC4CVA|5.0|What a show.  These ladies are fantastic.  We saw them live in Greenville,SC and the DVD is like being there again.
B000GIXEIG|4.0|I see a lot of reviews that say that the movie is not close to the epic poem.  Well, duh, that is one of the longest poems in history, and you have lots of interesting interpretations.  Michael Crichton's \\"Eaters of the Dead\\" which was turned into \\"The 13th Warrior\\" which was another good spin on the tale but not close to the poem either.  I mean there are some works of literature that can't be reduced to two or three hours of screen time.  That being said.  I thought this movie was pretty good, its not the best I have ever seen but I thought that the idea of making Grendel someone who has feelings and emotion was a good idea.  I was always terrified of the thought of Grendel as a girl, I read the poem and was frightened sometimes to think of that terrible monster.  Stellan S.  is a favorite of mine, he is what I called an under appreciated actor, always very transporting in his parts but never a star.  A great character actor.  As for Gerard B. well, let's just say that I have watched him from Mrs. Brown, where I said, \\"Who's is the cutie?\\" through Attila and now into 300...as always, he is a feast for the eyes but a great actor as well.<br /><br />All in all it was a good movie to watch on a stormy Saturday afternoon.
B000001E7L|5.0|This is seriously a great album. <br />it's epically good.  It's in my top ten favorites of all time. <br />Every song on here is awesome. <br />On top of it being an excellent CD everytime i hear it all I think about is the 90's... <br />and the 90's were awesome, especially for music.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|...but a great movie period.<br /><br />As an avid Bond fan, I was as unsettled by the choice of Daniel Craig as many back in late 2005. With that said, his gritty performance here brings back the Bond from Fleming's books that was hinted at in the early Connery films.<br /><br />Moody, distant and flawed, the origins of 007 make for a wonderful yarn and I guarantee you'll never look at a wicker chair the same way. Highly recommended.

0812550706|5.0|I can't believe I got this far in my adult life without reading this book! <br /> <br />I guess I was put off by the length and the sci-fi slant of it, thinking that it might be over my head. But this is a completely readable, completely engaging novel that really packs an emotional punch. <br /> <br />I loved Ender as a character--loved his independent genius, his pessimistic hope, and the strength that lay hidden behind his very innocent face. I found the narrative of his training completely involving, though I was much more concerned for his emotional well-being. Poor kid. <br /> <br />The climax caught me completely off-guard and was quite stunningly brilliant. Enough said there. <br /> <br />I found the conclusion a bit melancholy, but realistic. I imagine that the guilt Ender felt was not easy to erase, no matter what they told him. And the fact that I'm talking about him like he's a real person, well, there you have it. Card's Ender is very, very real, and very, very exceptional. <br /> <br />Fabulous book!

B00005JPMX|4.0|The trailer looked good, so I went to the theater with high hopes for TMNT (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles). After having seen the film, well, color me contented. This is the fourth feature film about our fun loving, pizza-scarfing ninja turtles and the second most enjoyable one (in my eyes, nothing can really upstage the awesome first flick, released in 1990). Unlike the first three movies - which were all live-action, with some puppetry thrown in - TMNT is full on, across-the-board CG - and dazzling CG, at that. I've never seen the turtles so dramatically depicted (check out the rooftop scene of Leonardo and Raphael in the rain - just amazing!!).<br /><br />Sadly, the blah storyline doesn't do justice to the spectacular animation. In its cliche-ridden effort, it not only borrows an old fantasy plot device (of the planets being aligned and, thus, causing mystical forces to come into play), it dips some more into that recurring rivalry between the sensible leader Leonardo and the impulsive and often angry Raphael. We even see a half-hearted attempt at a romance between April and Casey (they're now living together). I don't know how much actual sweat and thought went into the crafting of the story, but the finished product comes off as having that by-the-numbers feel.<br /><br />The plot involves a warrior king who, 3000 years ago, sought to gain even more power by opening up a portal to another dimension. The energy from the portal granted the warrior immortality but at the expense of turning his soldiers into stone. At the same time, 13 monsters were released onto our world.<br /><br />Cut to the present, in New York City, where our turtles are going thru a crisis. It seems that Master Splinter had sent Leonardo away to Central America for leadership training a while ago, and Leo's not back yet. With their leader's absence, the three remaining turtles have drawn apart, with each brother branching off and doing his own thing. Mikey has ventured into the business of entertaining at children's parties in his guise as Cowabunga Carl (as Carl, he dons a huge turtle mask over his real turtle noggin!). Donatello has started his own at-home tech support endeavor. And Raphael sleeps all day.<br /><br />But things change when fearsome monsters and stone warriors begin appearing in NYC. The Foot clan, as well, begins to make noise, now under the leadership of the sexy Karai. And with frequent sightings of an enigmatic nighttime vigilante known as the Nightwatcher, you just know Leo picked a good time to come back to the sewers. Mikey and Donatello welcome him back with open arms. Raphael? Well, he has issues...<br /><br />When Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird debuted their first issue of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles way back in 1984, they obviously had no idea that their creation would become such a world wide juggernaut. I'm a fan of their work. I'm talking about the issues they themselves actually wrote and drew. The stuff after that, when they got so busy with the managing of their TMNT empire that they hired other artists to put out the issues, well, I can take those or leave 'em. This picture takes the turtles back to their roots in terms of grit and seriousness. In its sensibilities and its darker mood, TMNT hearkens back to classic Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. Not much of that Saturday morning cartoon vibe in this one, although Mike does let loose with an occasional \\"Cowabunga!\\" The humor's still here, mind you (and mostly provided by Mikey); it's just not as prevalent.<br /><br />The voices are well cast, with Patrick Stewart (Prof. X, Capt. Picard) lending his distinctive pipes to Max Winters, the mysterious entrepreneur with an agenda. Chris Evans (Casey), Sarah Michelle Gellar (April), and Ziyi Zhang (Karai) provide good support. The key casting, however, lies in the actors who voice the turtles. Fortunately, though I've never heard of any of these guys, they come near perfect in how Leo, Mikey, Donatello, and especially Raphaelshould sound.<br /><br />Despite the inferior storytelling, this gets 4 stars from me, on the strength of how great the film looks. The exhilarating computer graphics allow our shelled superheroes to vibrantly come to life. Whether it's depicting Mikey gleefully skateboarding down the sewer tunnels, Raphael's headlong plunge down several stories as he parallels a monster's fall, or the frenetic and well-executed fight scenes, the animation is a blissful treat. And the good news is, going by Foot leader Karai's parting words, there's more TMNT movies in the horizon.should sound.<br /><br />Despite the inferior storytelling, this gets 4 stars from me, on the strength of how great the film looks.

B000M5B6Q0|4.0|Ok, so it won't win a Grammy, but if you liked the movie, you'll like the CD too!  It's fun \\"good mood\\" music - much like the pop music of the 80's and the theme of the movie.  There are a couple of songs on there that I don't remember being part of the movie, but overall this CD just makes you smile.
0143038419|5.0|For the first time ever, I am immediately re-reading this book, because there are so many gems inside.  I bought two more copies and shipped them off to friends who also give this book rave reviews. There was so much in this book I could relate with. So many of us have endured divorce, trying to find our happiness and bliss, and wondering what we are put on this earth for!  I will continue to promote this book to friends.
B000N6TX1S|2.0|That's what some bonehead film critic actually said about this dud!  Are you kidding me???    The basic story is intruiging enough - In the year 2027, a disease of infertility has overcome the planet and there hasn't been a child born in eighteen years; that is, until a young pregnant woman is discovered and she must be protected at all costs.    Like I said, interesting premise, but we are offered no history or explanation as to how and why the world ended up like this in the first place.  This is absolutely infuriating when the entire film is based on this premise.  The apocolyptic state of Britian in the future and the way it is filmed is hardly original or impressive either.  One need only watch 12 MONKEYS, V FOR VENDETTA, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK or even A CLOCKWORK ORANGE to see where the original ideas came from.    And finally, as for the critic's opinion that CHILDREN OF MEN is \\"Blade Runner for the 21st Century\\"...what exactly was this person smoking when they said that??  To even come close to the genius of BLADE RUNNER, there would have to be some special effects which depict a city of the future.  There are none.  In the future, Britian is nothing more that a huge pile of garbage!    One positive note I can make about this film is its homage to classic rock!  A cover version of The Rolling Stones \\"Ruby Tuesday\\" and the original version of King Crimson's \\"In The Court Of The Crimson King\\" are played.  And in a scene between Clive Owen and Michael Caine, there is a background behind them which clearly pays tribute to the album cover of Pink Floyd's \\"Animals\\".
B000NA28IE|1.0|This movie made me very sad, it could have been amazing, but it was horribly distorted. This is not the book that Christopher Paolini wrote. <br /> <br />I am aware that the WHOLE book cannot be made into a movie, due to time issues, but they could have done a MUCH better job than this. Everything about it (except for Jeremy Iron's performance, he is AWESOME) was utterly horrid. I hardly think that a second movie would be possible, due to how much they cut out. <br /> <br />Also, it does not annoy me that they cut things out as much as it annoys me that they changed things that they did not need to! For instance, Saphira's appearance, Arya's hair color, the color of the jewel in the sword that Brom gave to Eragon, etc. <br /> <br />Do not buy this movie, even when I don't compare it to the book it is still pretty bad.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|I saw this movie for my first time a couple years ago and I love it so much that I had to buy my own dvd. I can watch this movie over and over and I still don't have enough. It is one of my top five movies.

B00005QY5Y|4.0|Loved it.  The guy has a pseudo alternative rock-country style that I like.  First two tracks and track six are my favorites.  Lyrics are cool.  It's a classic \\"guy singing and banging on guitar\\" collection - you can't beat it.
B000LAZDQA|2.0|Look, first let me say that I LOVED Hedwig and the Angry inch.  So of course I was excited to hear that John Cameron Mitchel was going to do a movie that was going to skewer the preoccupation of the ratings boards with promoting violence over sex by producing a mainstream movie with sex scenes as an integral part..  I felt that it was long overdue thought it would be an entertaining and important movie.<br /><br />Fast forward to the reality... Mr. Mitchell has obviously been living for too long in the post Hedwig Bubble leaving him completely out of touch with real life.  It isn't groundbreaking nor does it challenge conventional wisdom when you make a movie containing explicit sex scenes in which the plot revolves in a large part around sex. (Please spare me the \\"It's about relationships\\" line.  These relationships were so artificial they make Cool Whip look Natural.<br /><br />Basically the movie is a pseudo-intellectual higher budget version of a 3rd year film students performance art project.  It relies on dialog that would be unrealistic anywhere but a womyns studies retreat or in an abnormal psychology class.  The problem with being a success in the film arts world is obviously a lack of ability in figuring out what is realistic behavior and what isn't.<br /><br />If you really honestly want to turn convention on it's ear and show the film ratings for the hypocrisy that they are with regards to sex on screen it would pack a much larger punch, to show a conventional plotline with the sex scenes not edited out.  i.e. Pretty Women, have the hooker and the businessman have full sex.  A James Bond style film, show the consummation with him and the foreign spy, a Horror film, have the couples have sex on screen before being killed etc...<br /><br />But to show a movie in which everybody is wondering around in a Zoloft induced haze stumbling into a sex club that is a pale imitation of stories about Berlin in the 1930's even to the addition to the cast of the host walking around imitating Joel Grey from Cabaret is just pure boring self indulgent pap.  The end part, when one of the cast finally has anal sex with his stalker, then stands at the window catching the eye of his boyfriend in the apartment across the alley where they then begin to smile at each other may have sounded good after Mr. Mitchell's 3rd Pot brownie but frankly was just a lame attempt at a meaningful ending that was the last gasp of a movie drowning in it's own misguided self importance.<br /><br />To say I was disappointed after the promise of Hedwig would be putting it mildly.  Hopefully John Cameron Mitchel can pump whatever well it was that gave him the inspiration for his first movie and stay away from the bad judgment and Juvenile outlook that produced this mess.host walking around imitating Joel Grey from Cabaret is just pure boring self indulgent pap.

B000MV9026|1.0|I think this movie is good for real small kids but that is it.<br /><br />I fell asleep trying to watch this and today lost track on<br /><br />a few things. It just wasn't my cup of tea. It had too much<br /><br />singing in it and too much dancing. It just isn't that good.<br /><br />The movie needed a different story line. Nothing much to it<br /><br />except for happy feet trying to figure out why the fish was<br /><br />disappearing. Not worth buying. I am 31 years old. Boring<br /><br />for adults.
B000001FTH|4.0|I heard the song \\"Pull Up to My Bumper\\" when I was in college - at a nightclub near by. It's odd combination of disco, new wave and funk really was unique to my new wave/disco sensibilities. Those gutteral throaty vocals. Who was Grace Jones? <br /> <br />I bought the album and while I wasn't really sent with the whole thing, I had to admit to liking some of it. <br /> <br />Flash forward several years and there's Grace Jones again! Only this time she's in a Conan movie and then as a vampire (Vamp). Finally I saw her in concert at a small Atlanta venue and she was....completely twisted! <br /> <br />While I'm not a huge fan of Grace Jones overall, this album, Island Life, really does capture some of her best work. My favorite is \\"Ma Vie en Rose\\" though I was too young to have heard it during the 70's in any discotheque. Other favorites include, \\"Nightclubbing\\", \\"Walking in the Rain\\", \\"I've Seen that Face Before\\" and to a lesser degree now, \\"Pull up to the Bumper\\". <br /> <br />Grace Jones is an institution. She is odd, quirky, and to my sensibilities an icon of sorts of the 1980's. This is an album that can convey her unique qualities to many who just don't know who she is. Those my 14 year old son says he thinks she's weird and refuses to accept that the weird \\"chick\\" from Conan the Destroyer is singing the songs (oh and he says the cover art on the album is scary  - I agree).
B000H5V8DG|5.0|This limited deluxe edition is wonderful for Alias fans. I started getting interested in Alias only after watching two episodes of a re-run late one night, and I absolutely loved it. The bonus material on the DVD, not to mention the bonus DVD in the false bottom of the box is completely exciting for fans. And like most people, I didn't even know there was a false bottom till I read reviews from some of the other fans. The series was completely engaging.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|Since I have been a Neil Young fan from the beginning, I didn't hesitate to order Live at Massey Hall when it was issued. Not only is it filled with songs I like, it gave me a chance to hear Neil Young unplugged, something which I had never had the pleasure of doing. <br />Some might consider this set to be overkill. The songs on the CD are exactly the same on the DVD and besides the film on the DVD is grainy. So why have both? Well, many of us have never seen Neil Young in concert when he was young and so the DVD here is a splendid opportunity to do so. Then there is the frisson of nostalgia huge numbers of his Toronto area fans will feel when they see the footage of Massey Hall. That's gotta be pushing some sales. Then there is the emotional aspect. Its one thing to hear Neil Young sing, but the full emotional impact hits when you watch him as he sings. And finally there is the price. Its so reasonable its almost silly to carp about video quality. My only complaint is the flimsiness of the casing which yawned wide open as it lay out when empty. I have other cardboard CD cases and this is the first to which that has happened. <br />As others have said, many of these old classics were new when this concert took place. My favorites here are Tell Me Why, Old Man, Cowgirl In The Sand, Don't Let It Bring You Down, Down By The River and Dance, Dance , Dance. I may not watch the DVD as often as I listen to the CD, but Live at Massey Hall is going to get a lot of ear time. <br />If you are a old fan of Neil Young, here's a good opportunity to feel once again as you felt the first time you heard these songs. Highly recommended!
0316776963|2.0|This just isn't my preferred reading.  I read alot of genres this just doesn't float my boat.  I couldn't get past chapter 4.  I never put down books always finish, however, this would have been pointless to finish as there was no ending.
B000IMUYJM|5.0|I hadn't heard of Black Christmas until I heard about the remake recently. Instead of paying to see the remake in the theatre, I went out and got the original. And I'm definitely glad that I did.<br /><br />Black Christmas introduces the idea of the first person camera killer shot that we see used by John Carpenter in the opening scene of Halloween. And it uses this effect very effectively as we watch a man climbing the trellis of a sorority house into the attic.<br /><br />The film is paced very slowly, with the killer making phone calls in between murders to speak incoherently and scream into the phone. Everything coming out of the phone is clearly from the mind of a mad man, and leaves the recipient of the call, as well as the viewer, with goosebumps crawling over their skin.<br /><br />With each murder, the tension grows as the audience wonders when the killer will be discovered. With the momentum that the film starts out with, it's hard to fathom that it can maintain its pace, but it does so and it does so very very effectively.<br /><br />Black Christmas is a horror classic of the highest rank; it's the kind of horror movie that made the slasher genre so popular, before franchises like Friday the 13th, Nightmare On Elm Street, and even Halloween now, turned the genre into dumbed-down presentations of gore, nudity, and one-liners. While those franchises still hold special places in horror-buffs hearts, Black Christmas is the kind of film that brings back what makes horror films work.<br /><br />The special features are a bit boring, but it's still interesting to hear what some of the actors have to say 30 years later, as well as some Q & A by the director. If you haven't seen Black Christmas yet, and you're a fan of horror movies, definitely check it out.
B00080Z53O|5.0|I cannot say enough about this film.  The subject speaks for itself, so I won't comment on that but what proves inspiring is that this is a total love story (not only between a man and a woman).  The acting all around is exceptional, and Javier Bardem, under the direction of  Alejandro Amenabar,  creates a very appealing Ramon Sampedro without oversentimentalizing a subject which could have otherwise been sensationalized.  Combine this with a thoughtful, interesting, philosophical dialogue, that leaves the viewer mentally revisiting the film long after its conclusion.

0385751060|5.0|This is a remarkable and vividly-told story that will stay with you--and provoke you to think.  It is not the only book that one should read about the Holocaust, but it is a valuable and unique addition as a \\"fable\\".  Please read it in that light, and don't try to test the events for historical accuracy--it is a work of fiction.  As an adult, I have been reading many books written for young adults and find them intelligent and provocative and intensely readable.  This unusual story is one that I will remember for a long time.

0743496728|4.0|This is the fourth Picoult novel I've read. Ms. Picoult handled this subject with exquisite description and rendered her character, Peter, to be quite sympathetic, which is a feat in itself. The ending did not actually surprise me, I saw it coming here and there. Then again, I envisioned an alternate ending that did not happen, so maybe it was a bit of a twist.    In each of the books I've read by Picoult, there is a courtroom drama described at length. This happens to be a strength of her writing or I guess I wouldn't keep reading her books. I have to say that out of The Tenth Circle, The Pact, My Sister's Keeper and this book, Nineteen Minutes was probably the most searing of them all. With the school shootings that we've heard about in the news, I expect the majority of us give little thought to what the parent of the shooter must be going through, or the shooter except in a kind of horrified and alienating way.  This book provides readers the opportunity to see situations from several points of view, and that has to be applauded.    Recommended

B000MZHW4A|4.0|This is a good movie, an important message and good acting with exotic scenery,culture, special effects, a little romance, all that a typical movie needs. I looked forward to viewing this as I have lived in Africa and knew about conflict diamonds and the horrors of continual war in west and central Africa and was encouraged that a major movie on this had come out.<br /><br />Like some others have said, a little too much on the violence and explosions, most of what was needed to show what it really is like but it goes on too long at the expense of not developing the characters.  You barely get to know the family and father (Djimon Hounsou) in the fishing village before it is sacked by rebels and most of the villagers are killed, tortured or captured.  The violence has horrible impact here but there was not enough shown about the family and village before hand for you to have developed concern and understanding of their life.  The same for the DiCaprio character, he seems like a souless, jaded, greedy diamond trader and not much more until the movie is mostly over and you hear the deep and painful story of his childhood. He does a very good Afrikaner accent and attitude. The beautiful reporter (Jennifer Connely)in the movie is just that, almost no background to why she is there and why she risks her life to write a story about this.<br /><br />There are good moments to the movie, some excellent acting by Hounsou and scenes as powerful as in Apocalypse Now.  If you could have learned more and cared more about the main characters the message and the movie would have been just as powerful.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|We see on a more regular basis irragularities in nature like the Tsunami's, or floods in Mozambique, drought in South Africa where other parts in South Africa are getting some rain.  I do believe that Al Gore is telling the truth which is not acknowledged because it is inconvenient.  I liked the way it was presented.  A movie I also liked was the \\"Day after tomorrow\\" which might not be too farfetched after all.  We must look to nature and at nature to find guidance as how to treat our earth (with respect).
074356619X|5.0|I have watched the DVD of the Secret many times (& bought several copies to give away). I LOVED it. However the audio boook (for me) surpassd the film. Far more in depth. More information & ideas. This is a book I will listen to again & again & recommend highly...& MAYBE cautiously let people borrow (dont want to lose it). I didnt want it to end. I could have listened on & on. Once you GET this concept, it all falls into place. Life is God & isnt that a beautiful thing  :O)
1567315682|5.0|This book is worthwhile in assisting the reader to truly understand that a good salary does not equal wealth. To accumulate wealth it takes discipline, knowledge, and a tendency to be frugal. In my life I know that as I have earned more I have spent more, a recipe for potential problems when retirement comes. It must be remembered, however, that the philosophy in this book when it comes to money is only one school of thought on how to live your life, and although it is wise, there are other good personal finance books out there that take a different approach. But all in all, this is a well researched book that can be the eye opener that some of us need to take control of our personal finances. If you want to become wealthy, live below your means and stop letting your money control you.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|Little Miss Sunshine is a good drama about family and how not everyone's is perfect, definitely nothing like you would see on the early days of television. This movie does have a few funny moments, but mainly focuses on the problems that families have. The dad is a perfectionist, the grandfather is a crack addict, the son refuses to speak and the uncle is a gay man who tried to commit suicide. As you can see, this movie isn't a family film, but it is  great none-the-less. The acting in the film is great, I was happy when they were and was sad when they were as well. The ending was a little disappointing, it has a climax and immediately ends without a real \\"what happened\\" after the contest that the movie is named after.
1581804849|4.0|I enjoyed the instructions in this book.  First, a detailed explanation  of how to complete each type of stroke is given.

And finally,(this is the best part)  it goes on to explain how to create original arrangements depending on the surface space the painter has to work with.  This book was well written and easy to follow

B000CNFC76|5.0|I am not a particular fan of golf, but I became intrigued by this movie from various reviews I had read.  I also liked the other movie I saw that Bill Paxton directed (FRAILTY).  As it turned out, the movie happened to be on while I was visiting family, and after a few minutes we were absorbed.      What keeps this from being like yet another underdog-from-the-wrong-side-of-the-tracks-takes-on-the-seemingly-unbeatable-champ cliche' film are a couple of important factors:  Though there may have been some artistic license and creative freedoms, the story is TRUE.  Secondly, there were no villains in this film.  Although Harry Vardon was Francis Oimet's opponent, he wasn't really an adversary and certainly wasn't a foe.  Vardon was a man of good character who conducted himself honorably and treated Oimet with respect.  Stephan Dillane has a look which would make for an effective villain, but his portrayal of Vardon as a sympathetic character not too much different from Oimet was done with remarkable effectiveness.  Though I was cheering for Oimet, I also found a part of myself cheering for Vardon as well.  The other supporting characters were also very interesting and engaging, and were played very well by a talented cast.  Bill Paxton again does another great job as a director, combining creative cinematography with understated and effective performances from his cast.    Overall, a movie that is entertaining and suitable for all ages.  It is a refreshing change to have a film with no villains and many likable characters such as this one.

074356619X|5.0|I like having the audio to listen to on the way to and from work.  I also purchased the DVD which help bring the book or the audio alive.  Today, I used the law of attraction to attract prime parking space..as this was my test and was recommended for first-timers. It worked 6 out of 6 times.  Once, someone passed up the prime parking, as if they did not see it.  Three times, someone was just leaving the prime parking space right when we pulled up. The last two times, it was just there...opened and waiting for us, with no other parking spaces around. It was uncanny.  Me and my husband just smiled and laughed aloud. Once? Maybe, but after 9 hours of shopping is just amazing, especially at a busy shopping mall. The book maybe good to take notes along side. Try something simple, like always finding prime parking space.  Next stop, a great life!!
B00006LLLN|5.0|I must admit. I grew up with pop, soul, and rock and roll in the sixties and seventies, and despised everything that was country and bluegrass music. Then, I heard -- much by accident -- Alison Krauss singing an old sixties favorite, The Foundations \\"Baby, Now That I've Found You.\\" I had never heard of Alison Krauss. I didn't even know that she was a bluegrass singer, but I was instantly mesmerized by her flawless, angelic voice!  I immediately purchased this Live CD and I must say that it is one of my favorite discs.  <br /> <br />Alison's beautiful voice nearly moves me to tears every time. Lacking the nasality of most bluegrass and country singers, Alison Krauss possesses one of the finest voices in music today.

0143038419|4.0|I found this to be an inspiring and entertaining read.  I especially enjoyed the Italian experience, although for me the book became a journey of slowly diminishing returns. Fortunately, the author successfully brought the journey full circle for a satisfying conclusion. <br /> <br />I subtracted a star due to the author's insistence to interject her political opinions into what was supposedly a spiritual journey.  Even though I share her political views, I was still distracted by their awkward inclusion.

The verdict is definitely yes, in fact after a few listens I would say that this is an even better record.  Highlights include Antichrist Television Blues, Windowsill, Ocean Of Noise and my favourite track, Intervention.  If you liked Funeral, this one is a must.
0060531053|5.0|I bought this along with [[ASIN:0060584734 The Homebrewer's Companion]], also by Papazian.  I think both books are a must-have for any homebrewer.  _Companion_ is more of a reference text, while _Joy_ is more introductory.  Both books have indispensable information about the basic ingredients and processes of brewing. <br /> <br />When formulating a recipe, I refer back and forth to both books.  Each has a variety of recipes in myriad styles that provide a good jumping-off point.  For customizing the recipes, I refer to the table in _Companion_ that summarizes the various malts and their contribution to specific gravity, then I go to the table in _Joy_ that catalogs the different varieties of hops and their contribution to bitterness and flavor.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|This film is great. It changes up the formula quite a bit and reminds me a lot of all the things I liked about \\"In her Magesty's Secret Service\\" and none of the things I didn't like. <br /> <br />The film is long, to be sure, especially for an action flick and some of the supporting characters aren't very interesting. However the depth they go to examine the main character makes up for this. <br /> <br />I hope to see Daniel Craig do another one. He definitely did this one justice.

The fun of \\"Love\\" is twofold - deconstructing the very clever overlays of different tracks, and hearing some of the best pop music ever recorded remastered to perfection.

B000M4RG42|4.0|Clint Eastwood's \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" is a bittersweet recreation of the events surrounding the Marine assault of Iwo Jima.  Based on the novel of the same name by James Bradley, Eastwood focuses on the sensational hype surrounding the raising of the American flag atop Mt. Suribachi.  Once the famous photo of this heroic act hit the media, it's exploitation began immediately as a rallying cry to raise war bonds to fund the war effort.<br /><br />The three surviving flag raisers were hustled around the country on a government sponsored tour.  Ryan Phillippe plays \\"Doc\\" Bradley, author James Bradley's father, a Navy corpsman and actual flag raiser.  Adam Beach playing native American Ira Hayes and Jesse Bradford playing Rene Gagnon were his compatriots.  None of the men felt particularly heroic and had misgivings about their exploitative actions, their sentiments back with their buddies still in the fight.<br /><br />The graphic wartime action of the horrors of the actual battle contrasted sharply with orchestrated tour stateside and all it's hoopla.  Eastwood dispelled the myths surrounding this memorable action while focusing on the psyches and lifetime experiences of the three men forced on top of an unwanted pedestal.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|After reading a lot of reviews about this movie, I decided to get my two-cents in. Movies don't need special effects to be \\"cool\\", and I think special effects would have made no sense.

0451450523|5.0|\\"The unicorn lived in a lilac wood, and she lived all alone. She was very old, though she did not know it, and she was no longer the careless color of sea foam, but rather the color of snow falling on a moonlit night. But her eyes were still clear and unwearied, and she still moved like a shadow on the sea.\\" <br /> <br />So begins Peter Beagle's, The Last Unicorn. What a fantastic book! This one has been on my to be read list for a long while. <br /> <br />The Last Unicorn is everything that a fantasy should be. It has unicorns to begin with, magicians, gypsies, old kingdoms, kings, princes, magic, an old castle on top of a hill, and a giant red bull. <br /> <br />It is the story of a unicorn who is on a quest to find others like herself. Along the way, she meets a magician and a gypsy sort of woman. They are on a quest to find The Red Bull who must be defeated in order for her to find the other unicorns. Plenty of magic, fighting, wizardry, love and loss occur along the way, all in breathtaking fashion. <br /> <br />The unicorn is a wonderful, powerful character. Unicorns are one of the first things that pop into my mind when I think of fantasy. Even white horses look magical in real life because of the idea of a unicorn. Peter Beagle's unicorn is the definition of what a unicorn should be. She's mysterious, powerful, beautiful, glowing, and magical. She reminded me a lot of Yvaine from Stardust even though Yvaine wasn't a unicorn. Read the book and you'll understand why. I thought of Stardust a lot while reading this book. It has the same magical theme, and is a classic fantastic fairy tale like Stardust is. In fact, I'm hoping that there's one scene involving a unicorn in Stardust that does not make it to the film because it was very upsetting just reading it. <br /> <br />The red bull was a wonderful character in The Last Unicorn. He is described as an enormous red bull who's size is more than one can imagine with horns like lightning and a sort of electricity coming off of him. He is also blind. He herds unicorns into the sea. Wonderful fantasy character and even though he's somewhat of a villain I still loved him. <br /> <br />The illustrations are done by Mel Grant and I loved them. They were exactly what they should be and I can't describe them much better than that. Black and white illustrations with a very \\"sketched\\" look that fit perfectly with the story. <br /> <br />This was my first book of Peter Beagle's. The man is an extraordinary writer. His descriptions are so detailed and beautiful and so different from any other authors I've read. He has a wonderful way with words and creates a beautiful story here. The next issue of Orson Scott Card's online magazine Intergalactic Medicine Show is supposed to have an interview with him and a new short story by him. Can't wait for that. <br /> <br />There's also an animated version of The Last Unicorn out there that I'd like to check out. It's always good to see a book translated into a movie and I believe that Peter Beagle wrote the screenplay for the movie. <br />
B000MTDRKE|5.0|I don't know how many people listen to the stucture of a musical work. It is somewhat of a \\"classical music\\" trait to appreciate music, not only for the skill, but for how the work is put together. Neal clearly puts a lot of thought into the structure of his music, and this is no exception. Themes are introduced, developed, changed into other themes, and are brought back later to evoke something that has been said or felt before. Neal is truly a fine composer, not just an average prog-rocker. He also knows how to build drama and use sensitivity in music. He must have had professional composition training, if I had to guess. Another great attribute of the music is Mike Portnoy's drumming. He constantly comes up with new rhythmic ideas to keep himself occupied, while punctuating all of the right places in the music. It's like he took all the great stuff Neil Peart used to put into Rush's music and went a step further. He is incredibly innovative and thoughtful as a drummer. This particular recording is harder rocking than some of Neal's previous works, which may be good for some or not for others. To me, it just fits what Neal is saying. It reminds me of Portnoy's band, Dream Theater, in spots. As listeners, we need to leave the artist room to express before dicating with our expectations, especially in terms of style. A favorite spot for me is the classical guitar solo, followed by the bossa-like section in track 2. Great stuff! Regarding the content, Martin Luther's Reformation of the church is obviously a touchy subject for some, especially Catholics. (If you are not familiar with Neal's recent works, he is a professing Christian and his last several solo projects make that obvious) But you have to admit, the church and Pope of Luther's time were a lot more totalitarian in nature than they are today. I don't think Neal set out to insult Catholics, but in illustrating the attitudes of the Pope of the 1500s, I can see how Catholics today might take it personally. Another point, and Neal doesn't reflect this, but Luther never set out to break off from the church. He simply saw what the church was doing (selling deeds [indulgences] to people to get their relatives' souls out of purgatory) and compared it to what the Bible said about salvation and found the church's postition inconsistent with Scripture. The 95 theses were meant to be topics for discussion. Wanting to be nothing more than a good Catholic, Luther was hoping for a diplomatic solution and was basically told to take it all back, probably because the money from the indulgences was being used to fund the building of St. Peter's Cathedral. When he didn't take it back, his life was threatened and he eventually was excommunicated. Are there any Catholics who agree with the Pope's stance here? As well, it was fairly commonplace for popes of the time to have mistresses. Some were simply in it for the power and did not care about Christianity. Are there any Catholics who would agree with that? This is not an insult to modern Catholicism. It may be that the Reformation eventually changed Catholocism for the better, making it more accessible for the average person. Personally, I am glad Neal has not become so politically correct that he is afraid of saying what he believes.
B00004VXF2|4.0|This album,apparently was handed by Lou to the company he was with at the time to try and break his contract. <br />Interestingly although this album was enough to make the company suits cringe at the time,it did not have the desired effect for Lou. <br />Over time it has become part of many list's such as the one here because it really is not that bad at all,but  definitely sits on an orbit out past the ordinary. <br />I dont believe that their is much more happenning within the recording other than than wild feedback and and sounds that come from pushing equipment into areas past the point that they were intended to go,thus giving the listener some very interesting sounds to digest. <br />If anything it is an album that i would recommend on the basis of it's uniqueness and also to hear guitar and feedback at levels that push everything into thered. <br /> <br />
B00005JPCF|3.0|\\"Happy Feet\\", the recent Oscar winner for animation, is a very mixed bag. On the one hand, the \\"March of the Penguins- the Musical\\" segments are very cute at first. They soon dissolve into innuendo and, more prevalent, boredom. If you liked the documentary, you might not like this as it sort of spoils the genuinely moving forces of nature in the former. <br />          The music is also a mixed bag, leaning as it does towards '70s disco (Gloria Gaynor, Hot Chocolate et al.) and all the connotations that go with it. We also weren't crazy about the abrupt transitions from penguin antics to road trips with the \\"guru\\" penguin to save-the-whales speeches (admittedly subtle).  <br />          Not much in the way of extras except for a clip with tap dancer Savion Glover, but there's one little gem: \\"I Love to Singa\\", a classic Looney Tune from the '30s featuring jazz-singing \\"Owl Jolson\\". This might have been the distant inspiration for baby Mumble, but I doubt it. <br />          \\"Happy Feet\\", as some have noted, might have won its Oscar on the heels of Al Gore's (and the fact that \\"Cars\\", which I liked better, wasn't Pixar's best). Non-discerning kids- and older ones might like it better- may think otherwise. This isn't a disaster but there are better movies about penguins out there- including a couple more Looney Tunes and the Christmas penguin cartoon on the \\"Madagascar\\" DVD.
B000IY06CK|5.0|First and formost, Julia Fischer reaches into the song, the soul of the music to give us the most beautiful rendition I ever heard. Her tone can only be characterized as jewel-like set within a golden aura.  It is not a silvery tone, it is rich, golden but with kalidescopic highlights of a million colors.    With all this she has a steely assurance and an ability to \\"dig in\\" to the strings (without the ugliness this usually implies) and works up huge creschendos and plays bravura passages with uncommon urgency.  Kreizburg and the orchestra are one with this outstanding musicianship and provide ideal accompaniment - they play as partners actually, more than as accompanists.    Not very long ago Viktoria Mullova declared she had excised the Tchaikovsky from her repertoire because the musical rewards do not justify the effort required of the soloist!  Agreeing with her, I thought I had tired of work but decided to give this a listen having heard Fischer give a phenomenal performance of the Beethoven in Baltimore last spring.  Well I am not tired of it when its played like this!    As to the recorded sound quality, I listened to it as an SACD.  In additon to the 5 channel surround layer I listened to there is an SACD stereo layer and a CD layer. I understand the stereo is not mixed down from the multi-channel mix but is a totally separate, but simultaneous recording.      The \\"surround\\" sound actually centers the listener about 7 or 8 rows back from the stage in an acoustic that is spacious and clear, but unlike in stereo the reflected sounds from the side and back walls come from behind and to the side of you.  It sounds very much like actually being in a concert hall.  While the dynamics and power of the orchestra are striking, the interplay of soloist and orchestral musicians is simply beautiful to hear.  This is a very natural sounding and wonderful recording.
B00005JPFQ|2.0|Considering the amount of heads the release of this movie had turned, my expectations were pretty high. Unfortunately, 'Ghostrider' was more dissapointing than the first 'Spiderman' was.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this movie is that absolutely no time was spent in character development. The story went straight to action way to early, and there was no bond with any of the characters like should be felt in any good movie. This seems to be a huge problem with most movies in recent memory. It seems like the theory today is, if you have good graphics and fight scenes, then substance really doesn't matter.<br /><br />There were a couple of funny parts that saves this from 1 stars, but this was overall just a boring, colorful modern movie built up way too much.
B00005MKA3|5.0|Absolutely an excellent compilation of song  along the same theme of survival, atrocities.  an album of hope and encouragement!!! <br />A must have Bob! <br />I listened the entire CD repeatedly and still couldgo on.... <br /> <br />Jennifer R <br />Grenada
B0001Z363W|2.0|I don't mind athat the album is soft I just mind that it's not very good. Zakk isn't the best guy to be singing slower songs anyways, great guitarist but a crappy voice. I love other albums from BLS but this one was extremely disappointing. Crazy or High is one of their best songs ever and there's a few other decent ones but overall very boring album.
B00005YU1O|5.0|What is REAL??? This film shows something to discuss... is this reality?? Yes!! But... are we or am I in a dream?? Does that matter??? <br /> <br />If u like this film, read from Peter Berger n Thomas Luckmann \\"The Social Construction of REALITY\\"
B000N6TX1I|3.0|I know mediocre reviews aren't normally well-received, but I still have to say that I was underwhelmed by this movie.  Clive Owen and Julianne Moore are fantastic actors, but their talents are wasted -- for two completely different reasons, but no spoilers here.  Suffice it to say that I felt that Clive Owen, one of my favorite actors, seemed a bit stilted; the plot was difficult to follow; and the ending wasn't as inspirational as I'd been led to believe it would be by the 'official' reviews.  I'm not a \\"happily ever after\\" kinda gal - I don't need that to enjoy a movie - but I really did find this one to have little to redeem it.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|If you think about movies that have been classified as \\"quirky,\\" some recent  ones that might come to mind are Garden State and Little Miss Sunshine.  Stranger Than Fiction is in a category all its own, though no less quirky than the aforementioned, and if you liked either or both of those, then you'll probably have a great time with this.  Maggie Gyllenhaal was terrific and well cast; and as other reviewers have mentioned, even if you're not much a Will Ferrell fan, you'll probably enjoy Stranger Than Fiction.  And if you do, be sure to check out his SNL video, just the audition part.  Truly hilarious, and 'quirky' doesn't even begin to do it justice.
B000002O1P|5.0|I'm a blue-blood New Englander to the core but I still love Southern Accents, because it is a quintessential American album. This may be not TP's most acclaimed release but it is his most autobiographical, since he grew up in the everglades of Florida, a topic explored in great detail in Petty's recent book that came out in 2005. Because I am a student of the Civil War, \\"Rebels\\" is one my favorite all-time songs and the best reason to buy this cd. How this masterpiece of songwriting didn't end up on the greatest hits collection in 1993 is perplexing to me! Petty's haunting verse about how our history remains with us today still sends chills down my spine:    \\"Even before my father's fathers  They called us all rebels  Burned our cornfields  And left our cities leveled  I can still see the eyes  Of those blue bellied devils  When I'm walking round tonight  Through the concrete and metal\\"    While sometimes the overall sound of this cd is a bit jarring, and honestly the horns do not always fit in with Petty's laid-back sound, the wonderful \\"Dogs on the Run\\" and the final track with the late lamented Richard Manuel of The Band singing backup vocals help to make this album a must-have for hardcore Petty fans.
B000063DS1|5.0|This CD is so great because of all the additional tracks that were previously unreleased.  There are also lots of photos and stories behind the concert/film that are very interesting.  I Highly recommend.
0887431453|5.0|As a graduate student in education, this is one of the better books I have found in creating a variety of lesson plans that include fantastic creative outlets. In every idea in this book it leaves room for change. Kathy Douglas is phenomenal!
1400044162|4.0|A compelling novel of Nigeria in the '60's and the civil war that ensued with the Igbo state of Biafra. The story is told through the eyes of three related yet very diferent characters: Olanna, an Igbo woman married to a political activist, Odenigbo; Richard a white man and a would-be writer who is married to Olanna's twin, Kainene; and Ugwu, the Igbo house boy of Odenigbo. The struggle for Biafra is revealed here far more affectively than in any history book. For instance, when Alice, a reticent neighbor of Olanna and Odenigo, learns of her family's demise and throws herself to the ground in utter grief, the affect is visceral. But when Odenigbo goes to comfort her under the untrusting eyes of his wife, this novel moves on to a deeper level. Half of a Yellow Sun plumbs the emotional core of its readers and brands its potent visuals onto our memories. Adiche has been compared to such greats as [[ASIN:0385474547 Chinua Achebe]], and with this book, she certainly has gone a long way to cementing her reputation as an important writer of our time.<br />4.5 stars
B000LC4CVA|5.0|What can I say, they are fantastic
0448444216|2.0|I purchased this book because I had read the hard cover and thought a lift the flap version would be interesting.  I still really like the story but this is a very poor rendition of a lift the flap format.
B000002OTL|5.0|I like this soundtrack a ton.  Surprisingly, despite the fact that I love films, I rarely buy soundtracks.  I only buy them if I dig the music.  This is one of the few soundtracks I have, and I play it quite a lot.  I think Tarantino is an overrated filmmaker, but his choice of music here is excellent.  I really like the Chuck Berry song You Never Can Tell, and I really love Miserlou, the theme of Pulp Fiction.  Son of a Preacher Man is a bonafide classic, and I dig Jungle Boogie, which is superior to Kool and the Gang's awful Celebration song.  This soundtrack is better than the film.
B00007ELEL|5.0|so what's the extra 20 minutes of running time between the original and the collector's edition?  i've watched the 'collector's edition' (which by, the way, isn't all that special/collectible) and didn't notice any new scenes or anything.  so... any ideas, anyone? <br /> <br />
B000006TRV|5.0|This is arguably Floyd's greatest work, and is truly a legendary album.  Rumour has it that Roger Waters showed this work and The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking to the boys in Floyd at the same time, and the Floyd members decided to do this one (smart move).  It's an immensely complex work, which was probably lost on many who just loved the lyrics of Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2.  It's one of rock's most ambitious albums, and Waters and the band should be congratulated for that.  This is pretty much Waters's creation, with a few credits given to Gilmour, and one to the producer, Bob Ezrin.  Many people have trashed Waters as an egomaniac, but he is a great lyricist/songwriter.  His lyrics and songs are vastly superior to Gilmour's, and he came up with the great concepts for all of Floyd's classic albums.  However, Gilmour, Mason, and Wright did contribute greatly to the Floyd sound.  They may not have gotten credit all the time, but Pink Floyd really interpreted Waters's work very well.  Waters's solo albums aren't as good as his Floyd work, and this may have something to do with it.  The tour for this album was one of the most elaborate in rock history.  Gilmour, Mason, and Waters didn't get paid for their work here because they felt it was more important to put the show on in their original concept.  Ironically, Richard Wright, who was fired (or left) the group during the sessions for The Wall, was hired as a contract musician for the tour, and ended up being the only one of the group who made any money off the tour.  This was probably Floyd's last great album, even though The Final Cut is brilliant in its own right and Momentary has its moments (I don't have The Division Bell).  There are many great songs here, much of them better than Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2 (Mother, In the Flesh I and II, Waiting for the Worms, Goodbye Blue Sky, One of My Turns).  It isn't a happy album (despite success, Waters's songs got even darker as the years went on), but it's absolutely essential.s absolutely essential.
0930289234|5.0|Long before NBC's Heroes hit the air, Alan Moore gifted the world with Watchmen--a convincing portrait of what America might have looked like had people actually donned masks to become crimefighthing \\"superheroes\\"--and the personal stories of those people behind the masks.<br /><br />And, long before Disney's The Incredibles, we watch as the plot unfolds, being about a group of heroes who are getting along years after national legislation has essentially outlawed superheroes, and how the old heroes are now seemingly being preyed upon by a \\"mask killer.\\" But who is it that wants revenge against the retired vigilantes? An old villain-nemesis? A jilted lover? Or is there some other, fresh plot afoot?<br /><br />Yes, Moore's Watchmen not only revolutionized the American comics industry, and opened the door for more sophisticated, \\"adult\\" comics (and \\"graphic novels\\"), but also created an archetypal story which continues to spawn imitators to this day. Watchmen created its own genre.<br /><br />Watchmen is not only the seminal narrative in this \\"realistic superhero\\" genre, however, it also remains the greatest. Watchmen is a grand, sweeping story covering two generations of superheros, and playing out several different tales over decades, through flashbacks and incorporating other, non-comics materials (excerpts from books, etc). It is smart, in the literary sense. The plot is masterful (with a finish that kicks you in the gut), and the characters are deep and sympathetic. Rorschach, in particular, is one of those characters that will stay with you for a long while.<br /><br />In short, Watchmen is a great, great comic that has had a profound influence over the years. If you've been at all impressed by the more adult comics in recent times, you not only have this volume to thank, in part, but you also owe it to yourself to give this book a read. You'll be happy that you did.

B00005JPCD|1.0|It's official: I cannot stand films for children anymore; if wasn't made before 1975, I'm not watching it. <br /> <br />\\"Happy Feet\\" left me almost gasping; I thought it would never end. The songs, the singing, the gospel choir cacophany of it all - all very Mariah Caryish - left my head pounding. Most appalling, are the sexual inuendos; unlike in nature, you could identify the female penguins by their gyrating hips. Entertainment for the whole family? Why? Films should made, unapologetically, to delight children. Period. Enough with the double entendres, the \\"adult\\" humour, the political jabs, etc. Ditto for the \\"message\\" that always has to be there: Save the fish! Don't be mean! Don't judge! Let's all shed a tear for poor little happy feet and his annoying tap dancing! <br /> <br />Give me old Walt Disney or Warner Bros. over this crap anyday. <br />
1582701709|5.0|I resisted seeing the movie and reading the book because of all the hype. But I must confess that when I broke down and bought the book, I was very impressed by the quality and presentation of the material. With quotes from famous people like Ralph Waldo Emerson, Rev. Martin Luther King, and Henry Ford, it reminds us that we are not the first generation to discover that events follow attention. Quotes and passages are organized in short sections, making this an easy book to dip into for a brief meditation, or mindful moment in the middle of a busy day. And the production values of the book are so high that it's one you'll treasure. You don't have to agree with every statement, but the general idea that the direction of our thoughts and feelings dances with reality is a provocative premise from which to live your life.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|Casino Royale is an excellent example of how movies should be made, especially Bond movies.  The producers returned to the \\"old style\\" of special effects which made all the difference in this particular movie.  Daniel Craig does a good job claiming his new role as 007 and the plot is relatively accurate to Fleming's first novel of the same name.  Casino Royale lays the framework for the rest of the series and begins the evolution of Bond.  It's worth the watch. :)
B000003TA9|5.0|DIRTY was released by Sonic Youth in 1992 during the grunge years. This album, their 8th release was produced and directed by Butch Vig the same producer for Nirvana's Nevermind and the Smashing Pumpkins debut: Gish.<br />Always changing their sound, this is their grunge effort. Very upbeat with a natural rock coolness that includes propulsive layers of sound and fury. DIRTY is the second shot of shorter pop songs in the same way \\"Goo\\" was produced. Both Goo and DIRTY sound more accessible w/o the long instrumental guitar noise passages that graced earlier albums&lt;best seen on \\"Daydream Nation.\\" Both Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon take turns & sing with a more fun, in your face - straight forward punk attitude.<br />My favorite songs on DIRTY are: \\"100%\\" - \\"Swimsuit Issue\\" - \\"Drunken Butterfly\\" - \\"Shoot\\" - \\"Sugar Cane\\" - \\"Orange Rolls,Angel's Spit\\" - \\"Chapel Hill\\" - \\"JC\\" - & \\"Purr\\"<br />ESSENTIAL SONIC YOUTH along with Daydream Nation(which sounds completely different) and EVOL- I also LOVE Murray Street, Sister, Thousand Leaves + 2006s Rather Ripped. I am also a REALLY BIG fan, I had to buy all of their albums.<br />DIRTY shows a wonderful transition for Sonic Youth still sounds fresh and clean - 15 years after it's release.

B000AYEL1A|5.0|This movie is my all time favorite and this movie will always be.  I'm so glad it's out on DVD.  Barbra Streisand & Kris Krisofferson are amazing in this movie.  The best love story ever.
B000MGUZMU|5.0|Although I thought Arcade Fire's previous album, \\"Funeral,\\" dragged a bit in places (\\"Crown of Love,\\" \\"In the Backseat\\") and suffered from some tempo changes that sounded forced, it contained some of the most heartfelt songs I had heard by anybody in a long time, especially \\"Neighborhood #1\\" and \\"Rebellion (Lies).\\"  This was clearly a band that was a cut above almost everyone else, and I eagerly awaited their follow-up.  I'm happy to report that \\"Neon Bible\\" grabbed me immediately, and hasn't let me go.  The Bowie/Byrne/U2/Springsteen comparisons are all very apt, but the songwriting is strong enough to give this band an identity all its own.   <br /> <br />For me, \\"Neon Bible\\" is part three of an accidental trilogy, in which part one was Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\" and part two was Wilco's \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.\\"  In the distant future, these three albums will tell people a lot about what the end of the 20th century, and the beginning of the 21st, felt like for those who lived it.  \\"OK Computer\\" looked back on the ghosts of the 20th century (who mostly take the form of space aliens) and \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" captured that claustrophobic moment right around the time of the 2001 terrorist attacks, which it eerily foreshadowed with its \\"twin towers\\" album cover and a song called \\"Ashes of American Flags.\\"  (The album was slated to be released on September 11th, but delayed due to problems with the record company.)   <br /> <br />And now we have \\"Neon Bible,\\" which looks straight ahead into the murk of the 21st century.  The cover art, with its depictions of children on a stage playing trumpets and reading from big, important-looking books, captures the feeling perfectly:  Collectively, we are like those children, making grand gestures but not really knowing what we are doing.  Yes, that includes you, Mr. President.  The album has been criticized by many for lyrics that they claim are too obvious and music that is too grandiose for its own good, but we need an album like this once in awhile.  We need musicians who don't always hide their feelings behind wordplay (which is so often a smokescreen for not having anything to say anyway).  Win Butler walks a fine line here, with lyrics that spell out the major themes of the album but still provide plenty of subtlety and mystery for those who care to look for it.   <br /> <br />The songs themselves are outstanding from start to finish.  The opener, \\"Black Mirror,\\" is all doom and gloom, set to a thumping beat.  Win Butler sounds like a crazed preacher who is calling for damnation to rain down upon us all, because maybe we deserve it.  But the mood lightens with the second song, \\"Keep the Car Running,\\" and from then on, the album alternates darkness and light in a manner that is reminiscent of Love's \\"Forever Changes.\\"  \\"Antichrist Television Blues\\" completely lives up to its title, and \\"Intervention\\" is another Big Statement that does not disappoint.  A more subtle favorite is \\"The Well and the Lighthouse,\\" which is sort of a parable set to a beat that is like a speeded-up version of \\"Black Mirror,\\" but this time moving toward a much more hopeful conclusion.   <br /> <br />Many listeners will hear \\"Neon Bible\\" as a tremendous downer, but then, there are those who say the same thing about Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\"  Largely it's just a matter of taste whether you like these albums or not, and that's okay.  Although they have little in common musically, they are similar in a way.  The beauty of the music overcomes the angst expressed in the lyrics, and the end result is exhilarating, and yes, even hopeful.  The children pictured in the \\"Neon Bible\\" CD booklet may not know what they are doing, but they are still children.  It's not too late for them to be saved.   <br /> <br />[Note:  I have the \\"deluxe packaging\\" version of this disc.  It comes in a little box that has a pretty cool hologram on the cover, in which the pages of the book appear to turn as you look at it from different angles.  Inside, there is a lyric booklet with the pictures I've mentioned, which is probably also contained in the standard version of the CD.  There are also a pair of little flip books, one of which depicts a book that is flipping pages (kind of ironic for a flip book, now that I think of it), while the other depicts the synchronized swimmers from the CD booklet splashing in the water.  Honestly, I don't see the point of the flip books, but if you want the hologram, the deluxe version may be worth the higher price.]
B000N6TX1I|2.0|Perhaps I just don't \\"get it.\\"  This was an uninspired romp though the director's vision of a bleak future. There's no back story - except a mysterious reason for infertility. Man has simply given up, with no obvious research being done on the problem. Ignoring the fact that, 1) simultaneous worldwide infertility is a really, really long reach. 2) Every government on the planet collapsing at the same time (except England) is an even longer reach.  Good Science Fiction requires a solid foundation and a believable premise - this film has neither.<br /><br />\\"Blade Runner\\" for this generation?  Not even close.  The ending was as much an anticlimax as could be anticipated from such an overhyped film.  Now, if we ignore the script, premise, plot and much of the acting, I'll agree that what's left is great. The sets, directing and photography were phenomenal.  The Nicholas Cage movie \\"Snake Eyes\\" used a single, long opening shot to establish the action and feel. This movie is composed primarily of that style of shooting - sometimes to such an extreme that it distracts from the movie (that's a good thing much of the time.)<br /><br />Except for the accents and vehicles, it could have been modern day Bosnia or any other war-torn local.  It's not a Science Fiction movie - it uses a Science Fiction premise as an excuse to create a visualization  of the future that is nothing new or unique.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|I first got my hands on this movie way back in the day, at some fly by night video rental store. They had a copy for rent, with no box... I rented it, brought it home and copied it to another video tape (which, due to the fact that I didn't have the right equipment for that sort of thing.. came out quite crappily) Still, at the age of thirteen, fourteen, fifteen... I probably watched this thing a few hundred gazillion times.<br /><br />Now that I have the DVD, its a whole new aspect of visual brilliance... (only thing I find to be a little tacky on this DVD release is the addition of computer animated planets that appear at times) For the most part its all the original material that really carries. A real basic idea. The band would set up all their equipment amongst the ruins of Pompeii, and put on a \\"live\\" show. Genius.<br /><br />I totally dig the feel of concert films that were made in the late sixties/early seventies (this was produced in '71, I think)... Just to have such a crisp visual account of what the band looked like back then is amazing. All about the power. This is pre-Dark Side or The Wall days, this is when, in my book,the band were best as functioning as a unit. And it shows. Highlights include... Gilmoure tearing it up on guitar, Nick Masons insanely huge drum set (watch him.. he hardly ever gets credit for being such a great drummer!) Roger Waters gets ill on some sort of giant gong! Rick Wright and David Gilmoure play a dog, like it was an instrument (not as weird as it sounds, but cool).<br /><br />Added to this are vintage behind the scenes clips from the studio during Dark Side recordings... which I found to be very interesting. There are some odd clips of the band ordering breakfast in a restraunt, and  afew scattered interviews, via 1972..., any Floyd fan should not be without this. It goes to show that Floyd payed attention to their visuals, just as closely as their audio, since the beggining. Music for the ears AND eyes.

B000NDIAWO|1.0|Why did Beyonce re-release B-Day?  Did she have a need to?  Wasn't the previous version selling?  The last time I checked, the first version of B-DAY has sold over 2 million copies in the U.S. alone.  It pisses me off when an artist re-release their album and the previous version is doing so well.  Usher and Mariah Carey did the same thing.  One word....GREEDY!!!!! I would've understood if the original version of B-DAY wasn't selling, but it is. <br /> <br />I can also understand the other reason why Beyonce re-release this album.  It's so obvious.  She's trying to get the attention focused back on her.  Normally when Beyonce is involved with a project, she gets all the attention and she loves being in the spotlight.  Who's been getting all the attention lately?  Jennifer Hudson.  Beyonce thought she was going to be the star of DREAMGIRLS, but she thought wrong.  For once, there's a female artist out there who's getting all the attention besides Beyonce. <br /> <br />I'm sure that the new version of B-DAY is great, but Beyonce isn't getting anymore of my money...she's greedy.
B00005B4GU|5.0|One of Radiohead's best, the title \\"Amnesiac\\" reveals the kind of music on the CD. It's ethereal and dreamy, focused more on the flow of the thoughts on the mind. The techniques used are also fabulous, and it's filled with bits of electronic music; a song is even recorded backwards, see \\"Like Spinning Plates\\".    I recommend it, absolutely!
006085880X|5.0|Um, what are these guys talking about? This book right here, that Jodi Picoult has written wonderfully, it's what you call magic. I don't mean Harry Potter or LOTR magic, but simply undying, breathtaking love for another. I don't know how people can say she doesn't develop the characters, because I felt so utterly connected with both the main characters that I felt like I was going through everything they were! I wouldn't necessarily have made the same choices on the part of Emily, but hey, that's what makes the book interesting right? Nobody's perfect. <br /> <br />If it was a bit predictable in some places, who cares? Every book is predictable somewhere if you know how to read fiction properly. And in the important places, I, despite the usual rule of \\"good guy always wins,\\" was not always positive about the outcomes.  <br /> <br />I finished this in a day, I couldn't put it down. I was on the edge of my seat, suspense the whole way. It's a tearjerker, a page turner, and a heartwrencher all in one. I am jealous, just like the lawyer, ...I want what these two had (Emily and Chris)! <br /> <br />Basically, two neighbors grow up together, they know each other from birth. Believe it or not, they have no childhood memories without the other in it. They are like two halves of a whole, they are always together, start dating in junior high, and in high school, one turns up dead, and the other wounded. <br /> <br />\\"He falls down, and she bleeds!\\" -Michael Gold <br /> <br />The story is of the trial and the tragedy of one surviving without the other, and... what happened, anyway? <br /> <br />Strongly suggested to anyone who loves romance, and isn't ashamed to cry, because you'll be doin it a lot!

B000060MMI|4.0|I did a search on Fastway to see what Dave King (ex vocalist from the blues metal band Fastway...from the '80's) was up to these days and ran across a comment that he was singing for a band called Flogging Molly. I heard some sample clips and honestly I don't think , from what I heard anway, that he sounds anything like he did on the Fastway albums. That's not a good or bad thing...just my observation. I'll listen to a few more, but I'd like to hear him wail on a song or two to compare his voice to that from the '80's. Don't get me wrong, this stuff will keep your feet movin'. I enjoyed what I have heard. I just need to listen to some more tracks. I mainly wrote this review to inform any Fastway fans out there who may be wondering whatever became of good ole Dave. I'm glad he has found solice in something he obviously enjoys doing. Keep on keepin' on!
B0000640SE|5.0|MEMENTO is one of my favorite films. Seeing Chris Nolan's earlier and equally intricate storyline in FOLLOWING is highly enjoyable. That film is definitely worth seeing on its own merits.

B000K7VHQ4|4.0|The movie was great. Edward Norton once again gave a great memorable performance. The plot is a love story set in 18th century Vienna. However it was very well written thus eliminating unnecessary fluffs that today's movies seem to have. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because, Jessica Biel wasn't right for this role (don't get me wrong she is beautiful just not suitable here), her acting was a bit cardbordish compare to Norton's. Also I didn't like the ending it was too dramatic that the movie lost its edge. Otherwise this movie is worth seeing.

B000CQO0WQ|5.0|The Gathering is, on all accounts, a highly influential band. So I have no regret in saying Mandylion, after 12 years, has stood the test of time and still floors me everytime I hear it, hence making it (at least in my book) a classic. Every CD they release is guaranteed to be drastically different from the previous and just as powerful. Even with their latest offering, 2006's Home, you look back at Mandylion or Nighttime Birds and just wonder how a band can stay so amazing and so prominent after so long.<br /><br />Mandylion is the first Gathering release featuring Anneke van Giersbergen. Her vocals were perfected in later releases but the raw, almost primal feel she gives off at times on here matches the heavy yet always experimental music the rest of the band has to offer.<br /><br />On a side note, I would buy anything with Anneke's name on it, she's just that good, but the band alone is worth the price of admission. Yes, when The Gathering is heavy they're great but it's on songs like In Motion #1, Leaves, and Mandylion that they really show what they can do. So for me to say that a band alone is worth buying a CD, I dunno, it just doesn't happen that often so I figure it means something.<br /><br />Song selection is spot on throughout. Strange Machines starts off with a bang that doesn't let up until the final notes are played. Eleanor follows in about the same vein as Strange Machines what with the heaviness, however the drums really catch your ear when you listen to them. In Motion #1 shows the group's more experimental side off well, seeing the entire band really play off of each other. Leaves is owned by Anneke even though the guitar riffs often sport an epic feel. Fear The Sea sees Anneke pull off some nifty vocals but it's the one song that doesn't really fit with the overall outcome. Make no mistake, it's a great song and serves The Gathering catalog justice but maybe it would've fit better on Nighttime Birds? Mandylion is the most experimental track included. From the very beginning you know it's gonna be an interesting listen and it fulfills that notion completely. Sand & Mercury starts off as a somber song but gains momentum to rival even the greatest tracks offered on the CD. And finally, rounding out the CD we are greeted with my personal favorite, In Motion #2. It basically takes the best aspects of the entire disc and combines them. You've got Anneke sounding perfect (you know, the norm), the band moves from light to heavy, and there's even some strings worked in the mix.<br /><br />As for the bonus disc, highly recommended. If there's one thing I've learned from hearing The Gathering over the years (and especially after hearing 2005's Accessories: Rarities & B-Sides) it's to expect the demos to have as much, if not more, passion than the original. Make no mistake, the originals usually shine brighter than the demos but hearing the rough versions makes you appreciate the final product that much more. Special mention goes to Solar Glider...amazing.<br /><br />My favorite songs are Strange Machines, In Motion #1 & 2, Leaves, and Sand & Mercury. For Anneke making such a strong vocal debut with the band on Mandylion it's hard to believe she only gets better with each passing CD. However, Mandylion is a fine start for any newcomer and without a doubt is sure to go down as a classic by any means.track included.

B000N6TX1I|3.0|I will start by saying a British film has a different way of approaching the filming process. I believe you have to have that knowledge and perspective when watching this. That being said , it doesnt excuse the laboring scenes that attempt artistic looks. The beginning has a somewhat convoluted feel that prevents the viewer from fully understanding the main charactor(and for that matter the supposed futuristic era). I think the surroundings to create the year 2027 were weak. Their seemed a concerted effort to not go overboard. As far as the pace, I'm not the average \\"Blockbuster\\" viewer, and it was slow. I personally love most films taking place in England or with a British slant but I can see how this film saturated the beginning with boredom. <br />                                The concept is great. No more human births  and saving a beyond rare newborn has great appeal. Too many unnecessary scenes though that Clive Owens charactor seemed to be walking through. A real stretch(and yawn). Towards the later middle of the film it takes off. This is not simply because of the action picking up, but because you could more clearly see a bigger storyline coming together. The filming is brilliant as the interaction of unique charactors brings realism. Pure excitement abounds as bullets fly through the twisted rubble and you root for the near impossible. Again, brilliant filming. So much dragging in the beginning forced a simple ending. The end is where the expanding needed to be, with depth. Im not a strict thrill seeker only, and love heart felt and intricate scenes, but the start to middle was a little too big for itself. The movie is saved by some of the most harrowing rescue and action scenes I've ever seen. The standard dvd picture is decent but not outstanding. I cant comment on the HD DVD yet. A word to the viewer, be prepared to settle in early on.
B000N6TX1S|5.0|I bought this dvd purely out of seeing the reviews and trailers. I'm not regretting it one bit. Amazing film. Alfonso Cuaron has incredible vision. One of those movies that makes you think \\"what if?\\" I'm not a huge sci-fi lover but at the base there's a really good moral story with little laughs (i.e. baby names) and oohs (the getaway) and ahhs (the scene of taking the baby out of the building) in between.
B000001FZK|5.0|The only complaint i could really aim at this swansong epic from Talk Talk is that it really breaks no new ground from Spirit of Eden- i find no real difference in tones sound etc. But ofcourse it is more a continuation or another part of that album. Most of the same guest musicians show up for this dark downtempo album- and the recording sounds nearly identical production wise and trackwise to Spirit of Eden. Still the fact remains these are two of the best minimal postrock art jazz whatever you want to call it recordings from the last 30 years. This was a band miles ahead of the pack that helped influence Portishead and Radioheads better moments. Its part ambient acoustic- very spacey and minimal before erupting into slowchurning bursts of almost triphop styled jazz. Some of the material foreshadows U2s achtung baby's darker slower tunes - the drums no doubt you will notice sound like that albums drums. I mention this only in sound - not to say TAlk Talk sounds like u2 or vice versa. The songs on L-Stock are long- far from pop verse chorus stylings and are completely uncommercial. This is music for musics sake and makes the new wave of Talk Talks' early career seem a bad distant memory. No band ever redeemed themselves so late in their career as well as TAlk TAlk. Not having both these albums is almost unforgivable for a music lover.
B000MZHW40|2.0|Sure, ya ok i cannot knock this cast or the performances that lie within.  Pretty political though, i mean c'mon, Africa was in turmoil and war long before any of us were even around, let alone the United States.  Suddenly out of nowhere the United States is the only place in the world that buys diamonds, ya ok sure whateva.  Set in a true time period but severely marred otherwise.  I mean, c'mon people, you really think the whole airship diversion would happen?  and the whole thing with posing as journalists was absurd.  America also dumps millions into this country and year and, well like they said, nothing changes.  the kids get recruited, the people starve and then the blame gets pinpointed in all the wrong places.  When will the zombies wake up and realize that the only person africa has to blame for its problems, is africa?  Blood Diamond has great actors but a pathetic storyline that has nothing more than the intention of laying blame in all the wrong places.  I know, I lived there for three years and I worked for Unicef and IAD Homes.  Drop 10,000 marines in there with orders to sweep and salvage and I can assure ya that the rebels will not kill another woman or child.  instead we get movies from hollywood that, like babel and syriana try to paint some tunnel vision for the zombies to get fixated on.  Diamonds and greed are not the problem, the problem is this country has not progressed one inch in the last thousand years.  Go ahead, give my review a negative hit, see if I care.  I care for the people of Africa, I just wish everyone else would wake up and get to the root of the problem instead of try to isolate non existent problems with fictional tales of trouble.
B0006ZE7G2|3.0|And not a great one, by any measure. While I'm sure the Pink Floyd fan boys will slobber all over this and proclaim its genius, the truth is that it's really pretty boring. Random trivial war images, check. Random trivial teen angst and rebellion images, check. Random trivial drug lifestyle images, check. Random trivial imagery of fascist oppression. Hooray! It's paint by numbers anti-establishment. FIGHT THE INSTITUTION! I guess this explains why Pink Floyd zealots have a long standing reputation of excessive drug use, you'd have to be toasted in order to find brilliance here. No dialogue and a non-linear story line makes it so the film is really nothing but a long music video, which like most videos depends on symbolic imagery, and we learn that film isn't Roger Water's medium. Instead of four or five music videos (which is how it would probably be done today) from a solid album, they made one huge video from a concept album. Actually a great idea and quite progressive for the time. But it's still boring.  I guess if I'm pressed to say something truly positive about the film, it set a strong precedent that music videos have the potential, as a medium, to do something very special, above and beyond what the song itself could do. That music videos can be something more than just performance/concert videos. Of course, it just showed the potential, it didn't actualize that potential.  <br /> <br />Usually, with any criticism of Pink Floyd, you can expect the usual  diatribes from the fan base about how you just don't get it, it's over your head, beyond your grasp, blah blah blah, but the sad truth is, there's just nothing here. It's just plain boring. <br /> <br />There's nothing. Well, except maybe we learn that someone in Pink Floyd has serious mommy issues. And even as the film bores you to tears, the music really is fantastic. In fact the music is so great it really does illustrates how they tried so hard, and fell so far short with the film. Buy the album, forgetthe film! The music alone salvages three stars for this, the album itself rates much higher. <br /> <br />And really, the flower scene?  Just lame.

B00003CX9W|5.0|While it is not plot based or known for a memorable and charming story, it is a wonder to watch.  Music creates images in most of us, whether they be memories of something prior, or something conjured up from the sound.  Fantasia is based on that idea.  Listening to this classic music, set to such elegant and wonderful images is a treat.  One of the best of it's kind.  Enjoy.
6303668380|5.0|I found and bought this as a USED item for less than what they're currently asking for it used on Amazon (I guess I got lucky) and until recently did not even know it exited (and I see it's from something like a '95 concert), I was watching Tom Arraya in that video montage for 'Angel Of Death' sort of thing and I will have to say that I don't know how that motherf'er doesn't rip the cartilage out of his neck with the breakneck speed that he uses and plays at during that tune.<br /><br /> This needs to be redone onto DVD and sold because I did some searching and it's not available in that format it's only available in VHS videotape at the moment. So it's a must have if you're even remotely into SLAYER: I was a bit disappointed as to the way the video/music was layered into and right directly next to some of the video montages. But overall it's an excellently layed out program.<br /><br /> email: laughingpig1@yahoo.com
B000063V8S|5.0|While I love most of the series, I really think as a whole this season was the best.  The characters are finally natural, wihout really having to act the character out.  Tons of character development was done, plenty of relatives appeared this season.  Also, I loved the payoff of previous entries into the series.  Reunion, Lore, and others.  While other seasons had great episodes and are a joy to watch, this is the one that really is a non-stop great ride.
B000N6U0E2|4.0|The PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is an excellent film that explores the heart of man. It tells the true story of CHRIS GARDNER, a man who, along with his son Christopher, lived on the streets of San Francisco as he explored the shot in the dark chance that he would be one of 20 men who would be offered a job after an internship at a brokerage firm.<br /><br />Very few people could actually survive living life on the streets of America and Chris Gardner is one of them. PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS shows how the homeless community in America isn't always drunks and loonies. The film captures the downward spiral and the desperation that Gardner experienced. Not to mention, it is captured incredibly well by Will Smith.<br /><br />This is a movie not to miss. Heartbreaking and inspirational. Don't miss the MEET CHRIS GARDNER featurette in the special features. Almost as interesting as the film.
B00002E23E|3.0|In some ways this film was rendered obsolete by the 2003 Led Zeppelin 2-disc dvd set, in terms of Led Zeppelin live on video. Shot at the end of the 1973 Houses of the Holy US Tour over several nights in Madison Square Garden, the Song Remains The Same had been shelved for a few years and only managed to get released when lead singer Robert Plant's car accident sidelined the band for a year. The concert footage finds the band a bit spaced out and exhausted at times in terms of the performances (although I suppose buggering daft teenage runaways and consuming vast quantities of booze, coke and smack will tend to do that to you); a nearly half-hour version of Dazed and Confused becomes particularly pondersome about 7 minutes in. Combined with the live footage were fantasy concept sequences, most of which appear to have been directed by 1st year film school students tripping on mescaline. Only John Bonhams really works well. Still, it is an unapologetic display of the debauchery, confidence and mystery that Zeppelin evoked at the time - just not really some of the band's best performances.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|CHILDREN OF MEN is a brilliant film. It truly truly is. In fact, this could be one of the most important films to grace the silver screen in a long time, yet I won't give it the full five stars for a couple of reasons.<br /><br />First of all, Director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, should be commended for what he has done here. This is a sharp, well produced and well choreographed film. Despite it's ugliness, it's a beautiful film.<br /><br />CHILDREN OF MEN is all gloom and doom. The youngest person on the planet has been assasinated. He was 18. There hasn't been a pregnancy on earth in years. The earth's human population is doomed. The world is in turmoil. Countries are in flames. Unrest is rampant. Terrorism is running wild.<br /><br />The color schemes are all grey and drab. Yet, despite all the ugliness and the grey sceneries. The camera shots are brilliant and beautiful. Cuar&oacute;n shot the film in a documentary style. It's as if you the viewer are running along side Theo Faron (Clive Owen) as he unwillingly falls into a save the world scenario. The violence is real and in your face. The explosions are gut churning and duck inspiring. What Cuar&oacute;n did with the camera in this film, WILL, without question, set a new standard for future films. More action films will be shot this way and I can't wait.<br /><br />So, why only 4 stars for such an important film. Oh, just a couple of things. First of all, the movie, story-wise, is a little one dimensional and anti-climatic. I won't give away anything, but I was hoping for more as the story played itself out.<br /><br />Secondly, the movie rests on the shoulders of a premise that a baby hasn't been born in nearly twenty-years and the human race has accepted its fate as doomed. In my humble opinion, that is slightly tough to swallow. If the human race is so void of humanity, as the movie suggests, I would think that sometime in those eighteen years, somebody would decide and okay the use of CLONING. Just a thought.<br /><br />Despite the downfalls, CHILDREN OF MEN, is not to be missed. Brilliant film. Turn up your surround sound and enjoy because this is what making movies is all about and don't forget the name Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, cause you're gonna hear it again.missed. Brilliant film.

B0000019HU|5.0|I love Slint to pieces. This record is so unique on so many different levels. Words may not do justice here, but i always think of \\"Spiderland\\" as a concept album: that being a monumental night terror one night. <br /> <br />You are falling asleep at the beginning, and by the end of \\"Breadcrumb Trail,\\" you are in R.E.M. sleep. <br /> <br />...Now begins the nightmare (\\"Nosferatu Man\\") <br /> <br />...The night-terror takes hold of your body (\\"Don, Aman\\") <br /> <br /> <br />...and now the aftershocks (\\"Washer\\") <br /> <br /> <br />..you reconcile your inner-demons and begin to wake from the night (\\"For Dinner...) <br /> <br /> <br />...finally, you wake from the dream and your life will never be the same ever again (\\"Good Morning, Captain\\") <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />I still find nuances that I have not yet experienced in this record.

B000NA28IE|2.0|ERAGON holds lots of promise. First of all, fantasy/adventure is a genre that isn't explored enough these days. You can count the number of fantasy films made over the years on your fingers and toes. Of course, you have the Lord of the Rings, Dragonheart, Dragonslayer, Conan etc. Secondly, how many times do you get to see a huge fire breathing dragon that looks really cool and REAL? Excellent effects.<br /><br />So, why only two stars?<br /><br />ERAGON is based on a book written by Christopher Paolini, who is most noteably known for beginning writting ERAGON when he was fifteen years-old. Good for him. I wish I were so lucky with the novel I wrote in high school.<br /><br />I haven't read the novel, but after watching the film, I couldn't help thinking that many of it seemed borrowed from other films. Many young writers write stories that steal from films they have seen. I know because I did. I know because many fellow writers I know struggled with the same thing. It's just nature. You watch movies and something grabs you. So, you cook up your own version in your head and put it to paper.<br /><br />So, with ERAGON, you get a story of a boy who falls into his destiny as a dragon rider. Yet, many of the themes of the film are borrowed from other films, like Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Dragonheart, Harry Potter etc.<br /><br />ERAGON is a decent film. Yet, a forgettable one. I'm just disappointed that hollywood has once again put its weight behind a novelty movie. There have been many fantasy stories written in recent years, and many of them would have been more memorable and more lasting films. Yet, they weren't written by a teenager.<br /><br />Oh, and of course there's a sequel coming. I wonder if people will still be interested when the sequel comes out?
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Fascinating, easy-to-understand presentation of the environmental issues that will drive our conscience and consciousness throughout this century.  This is a must-see for every man, woman and child.  There is certainly enough entertainment value to coax anyone's attention--I dragged my three kids, kicking and screaming, to see this film.  Imagine my suprise to find all three hanging off the edge of their seats, eyes glued to the screen.  We have all continued a lively interest and discussion of these issues since, not to mention multiple viewings as the kids share this information with their friends.  I have purchased several copies for my extended family, friends and clients--all to rave reviews.

B000MRA5NS|3.0|I missed the old James Bond action from previous movies. Where are the cars with all the gadgets, where is \\"Q\\", where is a good car chase? These <br />things simply belong into a James Bond movie.
B0000027RL|5.0|Other albums have good songs, but unlike the other albums that they released, this one doesnt have mostly crappy songs.
1582701709|5.0|We would have less problems in the world if more people followed the advice in this book
B000002JOH|5.0|Pantera has released a few albums before Vulgar, but this one is when they first started to take off.  \\"Walk\\" and \\"F**king Hostile\\" are my favorites, and love each other song almost equally.
B00004LN16|4.0|Good hard rock for your ears. Great big band with good themes: Satellite Blues, Stiff Upper Lip and Give It Up are the most remarkable.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|I like all of the Rage albums, but this one is better than the other two.  More metal-oriented guitar and the songs are more political.  If you had to buy one Rage album, this is the one to get.
B000065BPB|4.0|Comfortable. Does passively, block out a lot of ambient sound because of the nice over the ear design with good padding. The bass sound was a little disappointing (not very deep and resonating). Plays at a loud volume though. Comfort level is above average, but not great. Overall good, but not great.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I don't have alot of words to share on this other then you have to see it.  The actors make you believe that this is more of a documentary then a mini series.   Bottom line,  if you have been remotely interested in this,  then buy it.  You will not be disappointed.
0671015206|4.0|This was a good book especially for families where the children are always arguing about their parents money. Beside living below your means it mentioned also that millionaire's reduce their tax burden. However, the book did not mention how they do this. That is one glaring item missing from the book that would have got it 5 stars from me.
0452286751|5.0|Ayn Rand was born and raised in the Soviet Union at the height of Communism's influence there.  She moved to the United States around the age of 20 and embraced American ideals in a way that is made easier and more whole by having experienced the opposite and seeing how horrible it is. <br /> <br />Rand lays out in The Fountainhead the idea that human acheivment is, in and of itself, a wonderful thing.  When people love their work, produce something of value, and profit by that endeavor, the highest human ideal is reached.  For Rand, altruism and the false ideal of selflessness are the greatest evils in our world, made dangerous by the ease with which they can be made to sound wonderful and undercut the engine that drives mankind forward - man's selfish desires. <br /> <br />In The Fountainhead, Rand lays out a stylized story of a New York in which alruism has become the central philosophy of the people.  One man, an architect, refuses to live according to the prevailing ideas of the times, doing his own work in his own way.  The novel follows this architect as he comes up against a progression of figures more and more central to mental disease that is eroding New York. <br /> <br />Rand's writing is odd and stilted, but her philosophy is so important and compelling that you become wholly invested in the characters specifically because they are an embodiment of an ideal. <br /> <br />Rand's ideas aren't popular in the United States right now.  In an era where we think of Enron and Tyco as representative corporations and speak the words \\"big business\\" with no question as to the assumed and implied idea that they indicate something undesirable, Rand's ideas are more important than ever.  We need the jobs, the advances, the wealth and the innovation that are produced almost exclusively through the acheivement of self-motivated individuals.  We can lose them if we forget the lessons taught by Rand and by history. <br /> <br />A huge book with huge ideas.  Highly recommended.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I remember watching Johnny Cash when he had a TV show (hint of my age).  Never was a big fan when I was younger, but as I get older I appreciate his music so much more, this cd may not be his best vocally, but is so moving when listening to the words, it will bring a tear.  I have never heard CD in my entire life that could bring on tears except for this one.  Powerful, moving, haunting, god bless Mr. Cash, an American Legend.    Watch the video of Hurt, best Music Video ever made.  Watching the Man's life go round in a couple of minutes, June Carter watching over him, to the last caress of his piano as the video ends is almost to gut wrenching to watch.
B000003CMC|5.0|When Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident, The Allman Brothers Band decided that Duane would have wanted them to soldier on without him. And they did.<br /><br />Eat a Peach (1972) was released about four months after Duane's death. It features new songs recorded in the studio, unreleased live performances with Duane from the historic Fillmore concerts and songs recorded with Duane just before the accident. Every song here is a classic or fan favorite.<br /><br />The new songs include the upbeat Ain't Wastin' Time No More (\\"I've still got two strong legs and even wings to fly\\"), Dickey Bett's impressive instrumental Les Brers in A Minor' and the beautifully sad Melissa.<br /><br />Mountain Jam (a 34-minute instrumental jam based on Donavon's \\"First There is a Mountain\\") is the highlight of this album and of The Allman Brothers Band's career. They have never sounded better, and every member of the band shines brightly. Duane Allman's guitar magic was never more dazzling than it is here. At the end of the song, he introduces each band member by name, and says:<br /><br />\\"I'm Duane Allman, thank you!\\"<br /><br />It was his last goodbye to us, and the most emotional moment on the album.<br /><br />The classic One Way Out and an uptempo Trouble No More round out the live portion of the album.<br /><br />Stand Back, Blue Sky and Little Martha are the songs recorded in the studio with Duane. Stand Back is classic ABB with Duane's fiery slide guitar and Gregg's soulful vocals. Dickey Betts makes his ABB singing debut on Blue Sky, a country style song with plenty of Duane and Dickey's twin guitar lines. Duane's Little Martha featured just him and Dickey on acoustic guitars, and was a thoughtfully quiet end to Eat A Peach.<br /><br />Duane Allman, Gregg Allman, Dickey Betts, Berry Oakley, Butch Trucks and Jaimoe.<br /><br />Their music lives forever...
B00000I8BX|5.0|This cd has some of the finer Fear Factory moments. Cars, EdgeCrusher, Obsolete among other fine classics. I saw them in Vegas a year ago and although I had no idea what they played, they were good.
B0000549B0|5.0|Jimmy Stewart creates the wonderfully endearing character of Elwood P. Dowd.  Dowd has a genuine interest in his fellow man and has made the choice in life to be pleasant.  He goes along through life smelling the flowers and inviting everyone to his home.  His best friend and protector is an invisible 6 foot three-and-a-half inch tall rabbit named Harvey. Elwood is the friendly type who wishes to introduce everyone to Harvey.  This creates no small stir at home.  His sister Veta (Josephine Hull) and niece (Victoria Horne) wish for a normal society life, and finally after a disastrous party determine to commit Elwood to the sanatorium.<br /><br />There are a lot of positive perspectives found in this movie as everyone who cares for Dowd wishes to help him while he in turn ends up indirectly helping them.  This charming film was a favorite of Jimmy Stewart and is well worth adding to the film library.
0743496728|4.0|Jodi Picoult definitely knows how to draw you in with her writing. I read the first 100 pages in one sitting before I forced myself to put it down and go to sleep, finished the whole book in 3 evenings, and definitely consider it one of the better books I've read recently.  But from the start, I felt annoyed at her portrayal of what I perceive to be stock characters in stories about bullying. The bullying victim is nearly always portrayed as smart, unnatractive, clumsy and bad at athletics. The bullyers are always popular, beautiful/thin girls and handsome jocks who are sadistic to the point of stretching credibility. While this may be near to the truth in many real life cases, I think it simplifies the issue to always paint the characters into these corners and assume they will act accordingly. Not every child who is a bad athlete or wears glasses will be bullied, and not every athlete or pretty girl will be popular or a bully. I further think some of the ways the popular kids acted and talked (i.e. one popular crowd member explaining his torture to Peter by saying \\"if there isn't a them, there can't be an us\\") rang false.  From my own recollection of high school, the truly popular kids were secure enough in themselves to not need to belittle others to elevate their status. It was more likely to be those on the outskirts of the popular crowd who might feel the need to tease others as a way to be noticed. <br />This is just my opinion. I'm sure there may be those who would say they were bullied by kids who acted just like those in the book. But from the moment I read how alpha female Courtney Ignatio makes a disparaging remark to the girl with a buzz cut in the cafeteria line, to Peter wanting to join in his father & brother's soccer game but his legs become tangled, I couldn't help but roll my eyes. It just feels a little too been there, heard that before and a little too easy way of leading up to how Peter got to where he was. <br />I also sensed the twist endingfrom the first mention of the situation. <br />Still, a great book that I would recommend to others.
B000G75AE8|5.0|After a near-5 year hiatus, California's legendary Slayer returns with a great album as well as the original (and most would say greatest) line-up.  In short, 2006's Christ Illusion succeeds where God Hates Us All & Diabolus In Musica failed, namely the riffs, lyrics and mood.  The previous two albums lacked in creating a convincing sense of doom.  While dark tracks like \\"Seven Faces\\" and \\"Overt Enemy\\" were good, they never felt like \\"Dead Skin Mask\\" & \\"Raining Blood\\".  Some tracks like \\"Exile\\", \\"Payback\\", \\"Here Comes The Pain\\" & \\"Deviance\\" on God Hates Us All were lyrically stupid and disappointing.  But I digress............  Anyway, as a whole Christ Illusion sounds and feels like a Slayer album in a way that none have since Divine Intervention (and really since Seasons In The Abyss in 1990).  The aggression (both lyrically and musically) that has been missing is here in abundance.  To make a long story short, if the last few Slayer albums disappointed you (they certainly did to me), Christ Illusion should more than make it up to you.
B00000GBHA|5.0|I must have bought 10 copies of this album when it first came out. I gave most of them to my friends, so many in fact that I don't own a copy myself. I was the music freek (nut!!) amongst my friends and since I thought that Bob Wills or Jimmy Reed would have been a bit much for them, I played Cold Fact. Since I couldn't be bothered bringing the album to their houses each weekend, I bought them copies and left them there. Every time we gathered for a Fri/Sat night out we would put on Rodriquez, toke up, have a few drinks, eat pistachio nuts and groove to \\"Sugar Man\\" et al. I have to admit I haven't heard this album for over 25 years but I can still sing the words to nearly every song!!!! I am amazed that this album had such a small audience; mainly in Australia and Sth Africa, as it is an iconic release. Australia had an extemely vibrant Pop music scene in the 70's  thanks to Ian \\"Molly\\" Meldrum and his popular Countdown TV show. Along with Rodriguez, Countdown broke ABBA, which is a good or bad thing depending on one's perspective. If anyone out there, in a moment of madness, wants to find out what the average!! Aussie music buff was getting off on in the early 70's grab a copy of a Rodriguez album and see how off the planet we really were.
B000001C6M|4.0|I originally got this through Columbia House in August 1996 after I had become a fan through the purchases of Reign In Blood and Seasons In The Abyss.  Whereas Venom's Welcome To Hell was a poorly-recorded debut full of metallers who could not play to save their lives, Slayer's Show No Mercy is a poorly recorded debut of metallers who could play. That doesn't change the fact that this album is not one of the great debuts of metal but like Venom's debut it is an album that does carry some merit and enjoyment.  Not the essential first purchase but not a waste of time or money either.
0446528056|3.0|John Tyree is an ordinary guy living an ordinary life, only child of a shy and silent father John doesn't understand. He rebelled against the calm order of his father's life, unable to understand why the only thing that mattered to him was coins, and fell in with a bad group of guys with nothing more than drinking and playing pool and working an endless stream of nowhere jobs. Fed up with his dead end life, John joins the Army and begins to grow up and find purpose--until Savannah Lynn Curtis enters his life.<br /><br />Dark-haired, young, vibrant and full of life, Savannah Lynn Curtis is spending a month at the seashore in North Carolina with her college friends working for Habitat for Humanity. She stuns John at first glance. Her slightly gap-toothed smile sends him diving over the railing and into the sea to find her quickly sinking purse, while her college friends stand by and watch. John looks like a surf bum, but his tattoos and manners show Savannah something different. Her belief in John changes both their lives.<br /><br />John is home on leave from Germany for two weeks. He spends them getting to know Savannah and falling in love. He also gets to know and understand his father through Savannah as he slowly comes out of his shell and begins to dream of a happier future. Their dreams come crashing down on September 11, 2001.<br /><br />Nicholas Sparks is best known for his simple, straight forward love stories with lots of heart, a strong Christian theme and very little characterization, set in North Carolina. Dear John is another such story.<br /><br />\\"Dear John\\" is a very quick read that skims the surface of his characters' lives, occasionally moving closer for a few moments of honest emotion, but never getting too close or too personal. Sparks deals quickly with 9/11, Kosovo and the Iraq war, focusing always on the love story that is as hazy and creased as an old photo. The characters' motivations at times are stereotypically prosaic, with an underlying message of sacrifice before love or happiness. The ending is not a big surprise, although there are moments when Sparks threatens to pull it off. Melodrama wins out in the end and Sparks does what he does best, touch the reader's emotions.<br /><br />It is no surprise why Nicholas Sparks stays at the top of the New York Times best sellers list; he writes average stories for average people that glimmer with a promise of hope. Sparks will never win a Pulitzer Prize, but you can count on him turning out cookie cutter romances guaranteed to bring tears at the end.erlying message of sacrifice before love or happiness.

B000002KKS|5.0|While this comeback album doesn't hold a candle to the best of the original line-up, 1980's Heaven And Hell features a (surprisingly?) revitalized Black Sabbath taking new singer Ronnie James Dio (fresh from Rainbow) through his paces.  Amazingly, Dio & Sabbath fit well, joining the tried-and-true doom with the diminuitive frontman's Dungeons & Dragons writing-style in a way that felt refreshing.  Little surprise that this album went Top 10 on both sides of the Atlantic.  Unfortunately, this perfect combo would last only one more studio album and a live disc before parting ways.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|This edition includes a song sung by Gerald Butler that was not included in the movie, in a mood not reflected in the movie.  I think they were right to leave it out because it just didn't fit with the rest of the movie, but Butler singing it as the Phantom is to die for.  Also includes footage on the background of the play and the making the movie. <br /> <br />I would like to have seen some outtakes and other omitted scenes,which would have made me omit the \\"almost.\\"  <br /> <br />This is a must for any Phantom collector or Butler fan.
B00005R62N|5.0|Easily the most influential and essential live metal album ever, this masterpiece was recorded on February 10th & February 15th , 1979 (the day and year I was born) in front of a energetic Japanese audience.  Some controversy exists as to whether this is a true live recording or not.  Personally, I don't care.  It has a great song selection (although tracks from Stained Class are, unfortunately, limited to only \\"Exciter\\") and great sound.  A hell of a good introduction to the Priest.  The 2001 remaster features four live tracks from the same shows that were not released on the original album.
B00003CWPL|5.0|Yes in heaven everything is fine! <br />I absolutely love this film, it is in my top 10 list at NO.2. <br />It has a deep and profound resonating tone of wit and strange mind bending imagination that I love. <br />Yes Mr Lynch owes much to German Surrealist movie makers and artists, but he brings something more to this genre that almost defies description. <br />This film is a living surrealist artwork and without disappearing into some artsy intellectual critique, I just say, watch this film, soak your dendrite's in this mire of dark dreamy nightmare's. <br />I don't really want to be so pretentious as to state that I understand Lynch's themes and ideas that are the genius that is Eraserhead....But I am compelled... <br />Eraserhead is partly an illusive lucid dark response to the hood placed over the father's head as he is dragged to the gallows that is responsibility of making and raising a baby....... <br />Fatherhood as nightmare without a manual....in the end in heaven everything may be fine, but life on earth is a nightmare....The rest is purely up to the eye of the beholder and there in lies the genius.  <br />I loved the extra's on this dvd.  <br />If you love David Lynch and love surreal mind melting cinema, this is for you. <br />This movie will stand and live on forever, it will never date. <br />
B00064ADR0|5.0|Awesome follow-up to Johnny Winter.  As amazing and great as the previous album is, I have to give Second Winter the edge with regard to preference.  This two-disc \\"Legacy Edition\\" is broken into two parts- <br />Disc One- The original LP + 2 bonus tracks <br />Disc Two- The legendary previously unreleased Live At The Royal Albert Hall concert recorded on April 17th, 1970. <br /> <br />The sterling remastering on disc one and the treasure that is disc two make this a must-own for anyone interested in late 1960's blues or hard rock.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|This was a replacement for my HP12 which was one of the originals from 10+ years ago. Love the calculator, love the predefined financial functions, etc. The only thing I do not like is that a case has to be purchased separately. Shame on HP for selling a calculator (that will obviously be in a briefcase) without a case. The original came with a case.
B00005R62K|5.0|Darker, faster, and far more morbid than its predecessor, Stained Class is by far one of the strongest and most influential metal albums of all time.  Not hindered by age or changing trends, this amazingly atmospheric album quite possibly is the most depressingly morose metal release ever.  Many metal album sound depressing, this one feels depressing. Sad Wings Of Destiny may have been the dream of morbidity, Stained Class is the the realization of that dream.  This is the last album to sound completely uncompromised before the Priest became anthemic.
1400097029|5.0|The author of The Sea, John Banville, certainly deserved to receive the Man Booker Prize for this book.  Every sentence is so beautifully written, so lyrical, so poetic, with a rhythm that rocks the reader like the sea.  And, like the sea, calm for much of the time but eventually swelling more and more, this story also rises at the end and comes crashing down upon us.  Just about the time you think the storm is over, there is another wave that comes and hits you at the end of the book. <br /> <br />Banville adeptly captures human behavior, describing subtle, yet profound, moments--those untold secrets that the next generation will only get a hints of and a sense of, but never the full truth.   <br /> <br />This is a book for people who like language and observations about people.  Like the protagonist, you sometime feel like you are the observer, and other times you feel like you are being observed.  Banville is truly a gifted and polished writer--his Irish heritage is evident in every line. <br />
B0000028RR|5.0|Classic debut and easily one of the best albums released in the '90s, Rage Against The Machine set the ball rolling for the inevitable mash-up of metal and rap.  Granted, this mutation was both for better (RATM themselves) and for worse (Limp Bizkit, Korn, et al), but at the time and even hearing it now, it was an exciting album of possibilities.  No, most listeners weren't inspired to change the system or the world, but they undeniably learned a little about what was going on outside of their homes and cities.  Like good gangsta rap, one could get a snaphot of things going on in other people's lives.  Anyway, if you haven't been ruined by the likes of overdone Korn or Limp Bizkit and want a great album with a point, you could do far worse than to start here.
0739333771|5.0|I liked the lyrical quality of the book so much, I also bought it in audio form so I could actually hear an Irish voice tell the story.  I found that, when I read the book, there were passages that Banville wrote that were so beuatifully written that I had to close the book and think about what he had just said before continuing on.  Every line written by the author (well deserving of the Man Booker Prize, I might add) is beautiful and hearing it told reinforced for me what a superb author he is.   <br /> <br />The story itself is interesting, in a subtle, way.  If you like language and stories about getting older and the memories one recalls of one's youth, then this is a story that could very well interest you.
B000002HJR|5.0|I recently repurchased this album and man, does it take me back. Just listening to it now brings me back to the very drunken days on spring 2002.  This album makes me think of the solitary drinking days and nights that I spent being thrashed and suicidal.  Most wouldn't consider those types of memories to be particularly invigorating or happy.  I do.  The reason being is that I can see how much things have gotten better for me since then.  This album is both a high and low watermark of my life.  Before I turn this into a romance novel, let me say that this album sustained me through some pretty tough times in my early 20s.  I'm glad to be alive, sober, and content in 2007 and able to enjoy this album on a different level. <br /> <br />Songs of Particular Mention <br /> <br />\\"Bury Me In Smoke\\", \\"Temptation's Wings\\", \\"Underneath Everything\\", \\"Stone The Crows\\"
B000NA77YO|5.0|There is some amazing music on this disc.  Ronnie James Dio has one of the best heavy metal voices to this day.<br /><br />The production on this CD is top notch.  The songs are clean sounding and powerful; the mix is very well done.<br /><br />If you are a Sabbath fan, or just a fan of good rock and roll, buy this disc!!
B000002J03|5.0|The first Led Zeppelin album I ever heard and still, arguably, my favorite one.  I bought this on cassette for my dad as a Christmas present in 1990.  Soon after, I swiped it from him and listened the hell out of it throughout the bulk of 1991 and 1992.  I got it on CD (the unremastered version) in 1994 and have had every version since than.  I even have both LPs that my dad owned (one was long ago worn out by extended plays).  My favorite memory is that of my dad shushing me at the part in \\"Bring It On Home\\" when the mumbling ends and the heavy part begins.  He had a good point and that memory always brings a smile to me.  Anyway, the only song I have never really liked was \\"Thank You\\" (would have been better on III.  The rest has always been top-notch and I am always disappointed when others say IV or Houses Of The Holy is better.
B000G7PMD2|5.0|Awsome, great set list. Performance Flawless! <br /> <br />The whole group do a great job (like always) and the orchestra does fantastic following the whole six degrees album (side 2) and octivarium and metropolis and more! They do their classics great! Buy this, and if you dont know about Dream Theater... Your world will change, proceed to buy all their albums :)
075640407X|5.0|Fresh, Exciting. The premise is similar to all fantasy tales, but Rothfuss' approach is delicate, not boarish. His characters act of their own accord, and he doesn't take into account what his readers WANT to happen, but what should happen. With an unassuming and unobtrusive style, Rothfuss delivers a beautiful tale with ease and excitement. Simply a pleasure. (P.S. Do not start this book if you wish to accomplish anything in the next few days.)
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Having seen all the Bond films and, like the most of the galaxy, loving Sean Connery, I was skeptical of the remake. Does the world really another James Bond or another tired remake?<br /><br />Well, this isn't my old suave, testosterone-heady, gadget-wielding James Bond. This is the real deal. Classy, yes. But flawed, tough, riveting, and genuine.<br /><br />This is heart and guts and brains wrapped in sinew. This is the best Bond since Connery. No silly girls on his arm. These \\"bond women\\" are beautiful and smart and scintillate. Like Fred Astaire, Craig makes them a little sweeter, a little lighter, a little more alluring. With a swirl he holds them up to be appreciated and admired and steps back graciously- attending.<br /><br />Action galore. Intricate plot. Brutally evil bad guys. Excellent. Good show, old man!
B000MQC9H4|2.0|I like romantic comedies and the actors in this film but sorry to say \\"The Holiday\\" was disappointing.  The film premise was good but about 50% of the movie was weak, not funny, and unreal.    <br />From previews Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz's characters switch homes (one in Great Britain the other in the US, California) for the Holidays and unexpectedly find romance.  <br /> <br />Early in the film Kate's current romance and office environment seem to be likened to \\"Bridget Jones Diary\\" (one of my favorites).  But the extreme Kate's character tries before leaving for the US doesn't seem believable (Bridget would have simply eaten a couple gallons of ice cream and called it a day).    <br /> <br />Then Kate's character agrees to the home exchange with no online picture or prescreening, just Cameron's description that her California home was larger then Kate's.  Not too believable and pretty unsafe but I ignored it for the sake of entertainment. <br /> <br />What I couldn't ignore is the romance between Jack and Kate's characters. <br />Jack Black wasn't cast well for this part.  Sometimes Jack seemed to be portraying a gay friend just hanging out with Kate.  Other times he seemed like a full size Chucky doll (a child's possessed doll from the movie \\"Child's Play\\") when he smiled or tried to be cute interacting with Kate's character, he looked creepy.   It felt like Kate really pushed herself to even laugh at Jack's characters weak jokes.  The writers or someone seemed to be aware of the mismatch so they added additional characters and sub plots for this part of the film.  It didn't help.  This part of the film isn't romantic, funny or even entertaining.   <br />It was bad. <br /> <br />At the beginning of the film Cameron's interaction with her current boyfriend seemed forced with no chemistry.  It looked the way it was, an actor just coming in for a few scenes and not really building a rapport with the other actor.   <br />Then Cameron's character traveling to a town in Great Britain she never heard of, to a home she just found on the internet 2 days earlier,  and alone seemed unreal too, But.............. <br /> <br />On the positive side, Cameron played Cameron, a very stylish, kind of playful American girl.  Jude played an attractive partying bachelor character on the surface but a sensitive and protective man deep down.  They had great chemistry together and were a believable couple.   The Christmassy atmosphere depicted in Great Britain with the snow and country side gave the film that holiday feel and later the addition of some really sweet kids made this part of the film likable.   The ending was nice too (no dialog), and a beautiful country house covered in snow and twinkling lights.   <br /> <br />If you laugh easily and ignore a lot of problems with this film, you might like it.   <br />I didn't.  Although half the film was OK for me, I wouldn't want to see it again.  <br /> <br />
B00078XGRO|3.0|I love the movie.  I'd be hard pressed to say it's my favorite Star Trek movie since it's so hard to beat Wrath of Khan, but it's definitely my favorite Next Gen movie. <br /> <br />The bonuses however, are hardly worth purchasing the two disc collector's edition.  I understand that the movie was filmed before the days of DVD and the producers didn't go into the project expecting to hand over hours worth of bonus material.  It shows.  All of the extras felt like they scrounged together whatever behind the scenes footage they could find and tried to build little documentary segments out of it.  In my opinion, it failed spectacularly. <br /> <br />I, personally, was hoping for extras about the Borg Queen.  Her makeup, her art direction.  There is some of that, but not a lot.  The only mention of her makeup is in passing and there are no behind the scenes footage of the makeup process at all. <br /> <br />All in all, I found the extras to be seriously lacking and not worth the additional price.
B000NA28IE|1.0|It ripped off the book. It was a total disgrase to it. Christopher Paolini I would almost gurantee is about to sue the movie producers. It was that bad. Everything was wrong - from the color of Arya's hair, to Brom, the fighting scenes, the villages, everything. I went in to the movie theater knowing it would not be good, considering movie reviews and friend recomandations, but I had to see it for myself. I almost cried. It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen - and no, I am not exagerating. Even without reading the book, which I have and loved, it was still a horrible movie between the actors portraying the characters, the rating, the music, and the effects. Having read the book, on top of the horrible movie to begin with, and since the movie directors and writers did not even read the book, it was a horendious movie. There was only one village scene, the fighting was extremely fake, and they added in things and took out things that should not have been messed with - especially Arya. The war scenes lasted only 5 minutes, and they were so fake and evem if it had okay special effects, they were uncalled for special effects. and it was just terrible. The twins were bairly in the movie, if they were in it at all, and they never portrayed the importance and significance of the egg, and its background. They effects of the dragons were very well done, but it does not even come close to being able to just erase all the other mishaps because they got one thing right. The other thing that really made no sense about the movie was the length. How can you turn a 556 page book into about an hour and a half film? It just does not make any sense. I am not sure what happened with Stefen Fangmeier (director), as he has helped make a few good movies in the past, but this one is definitley his worst movie by far in my opinion. It was his first time directing a movie himself, and I think he needs to go back to doing visual effects, because that was the only strong point in themovie. I am not sure that Peter Buchman (screenplay writer) even read the book, as the movie was so far off from the book. He does not have much experience, having only written for Jurassic Park 3 and a few upcoming films. The cast is only somewhat well known, with a few new actors, but other than that the cast was a decent group, but they are better than Eragon, I can tell you that. I cant exactally say how bad it is, it just is. It is terrible whether you have read the book or not. My advice is that if you have seen the movie and not read the book, and you are thinking well if the movie is terrible the book must be to, to actually read the book because it is a wonderful piece of literature, unlike the book which is a disgrace to media. If you have read the book and seen the movie, and love the book and hate the movie, ignore the movie and give the advice I am giving. If you love the movie, then thats your opinion. If you love the movie and have not read the book however, read the book, and if you still love the movie, it is still your opinion.
B00005JM0B|5.0|This is an all time classic movie. First of its kind with the special effects that will only drive the industry to go further.
B000J10ERO|2.0|I can understand why everyone would want this to succeed, but there are three reasons why it didn't. First of all, you would think Warner Brothers would learn from the reinvention of the Batman franchise they nearly killed. I always thought the target audience should be adults, and then would eventually make it down to kids. This kind of campy storytelling will not be tolerated by the public at large anymore.  <br /> <br />Secondly, I felt there was some sentimental value attached to this film due to the passing of Christopher and Dana Reeve to not allow a more objective critique of the film. I'm not coming down on Brandon Routh at all. I think he did a wonderful job taking the Superman mantle. Aside from a few poor casting choices (Bossworth and Posey). The cast carries out very good performances. Not surprising was Kevin Spacey's marvelous performance as Lex Luthor. While clearly differing from Hackman's performance. Spacey offers a more jubulent take which adds more depth to the character. <br /> <br />And third, what made this film lose its cohesiveness was the direction of the story. Bryan Singer did a great job of re introducing the characters. But after that failed to take the movie in a clear direction. So in truth, you only need to see the first half of the film. After the second half you might end up scratching your head. <br /> <br />A shout to the people at Warner Brothers. You boys clearly don't have a clue wether you have a good thing or a bad thing so I'll make this real simple. Either hire a competent writer to tell a good story or sell the rights to make these movies. Superman is a good character with a wealth of material in the mythos to use. And it shouldn't be butchered by the likes of you. Take notice folks, Donner's films are going to out gross this one too.
B000MTOKXW|5.0|One must be in the right frame of mind for LOVE's unique album Forever Changes.  It's all breezy guitars, lush orchestrations, Tijuana brass, no real hard rock, and haunting tunes woven together into an eerie semi-arid urban tapestry that demands and requires your attention.  I had special-ordered this legendary record decades ago on vinyl (it never went out of print).  Listening to this LP at 18 or so, about 10 years after its release, I was not yet sophisticated enough to appreciate the musical depth.  I was listening to the New Wave, and an old hand at 60s and 70s Rock, and at the time was bored by it.  Now I realize Forever Changes is simply a beautifully realized personal statement (Arthur Lee's) including his comments upon being a black man in a largely \\"white\\" subculture - L.A.'s acid-rock, country-western, and psychedelic bands, particularly those bands playing at the Whiskey-A-Go-Go - plus his own passion for that city (he later said he felt the songs were about his expected impending death - he passed away decades later in 2006).  A real summer night driving record, LOVE Forever Changes is a sultry delight, a relic and microcosm, a time capsule and breaking chrysalis . . . this is a great, tuneful record of happenstance, almost outsider-art for its lack of significant commercial success, and may possibly be one of your undiscovered loves.<br />Thank goodness for Elektra who not only discovered Detroit bands THE MC5, and THE STOOGES, but particularly Whiskey-A-Go-Go bands like THE DOORS and LOVE.  Thank goodness for RHINO re-issuing Forever Changes with the bonus tracks (including \\"Hummingbird\\" and LOVE's last single \\"Your Mind And We Belong Together\\" b/w \\"Laughing Stock.\\")
B000AL730O|5.0|With \\"Chaos & Creation,\\" Paul McCartney has finally put out an album by the guy who wrote \\"Eleanor Rigby,\\" \\"Blackbird,\\" and \\"Hey Jude,\\" the guy who wrote songs in all shades, not just bright pastels.  You can't help but think this CD is the product of all the grief Sir Paul has gone through since Linda's death, including the ill-fated second marriage, the tabloidization of his life, the death of George Harrison and general intimations of mortality.<br /><br />Not say there aren't upbeat songs here.  \\"Fine Line\\" is a front-parlor rocker and \\"English Tea\\" is silly (but in a more knowing way than his Wings-era silliness), but the songs that stick are deeply soulful: \\"Jenny Wren,\\" which might be his best post-Beatles tune since \\"Maybe I'm Amazed,\\" and \\"Promise to You Girl,\\" which, while upbeat, has an undertone of desperation.  Mostly, this CD represents the artist Paul's return and triumph over the mere entertainer, the coasting-on-his-reputation, and, yes, the sentimental writer of silly love songs.<br /><br />I wish for renewed happiness for Paul McCartney.  But I hope he doesn't forget the blues that made this superb album possible.
B000MV9026|1.0|My children are too young to have 'gotten' any of the many sexual songs and remarks, but I was watching in amazement and shocked that a children's movie could be so dirty.  Needless to say, we didn't finish watching the movie...
B000NA77YO|5.0|Okay, I'm biased as anything. Black Sabbath is my favorite band of all time. I own every piece of Black Sabbath music out there, and I mean EVERYTHING! And when I say I'm a fan of Black Sabbath, I mean every single era/version of Black Sabbath, be it the classic era of Ozzy Osbourne, the one off shots with Ian Gillan and Glenn Hughes, the rocky Tony Martin years, and most importantly the legendary periods with Ronnie James Dio.<br /><br />You see, it was Ronnie James Dio's time in Sabbath that got me into them in the first place! 1981:Thirteen years old, sneaking into the R rated animated feature \\"Heavy Metal\\" and hearing that legendary opus \\"The Mob Rules\\" blasting through the screen like nothing my ears had ever heard before.<br /><br />I've been hooked ever since.<br /><br />Now, Rhino Records has finally given this line-up it's proper due with \\"The Dio Years\\". Within this fully remastered compilation is 13 select cuts from Black Sabbath's four officially released albums with Dio: Heaven And Hell, Mob Rules, Live Evil, and Dehumanizer. While to fully please any fan of this era, one disc doesn't fully cut it (where's The Sign Of The Southern Cross, Walk Away, or their biggest hit from the 90's Time Machine?!!?), it does give members of this new generation a great sample of what they may have missed while growing up in this Alternative/Rap/Nu-Metal world of today.<br /><br />Most of the big ones are here: Neon Knights, Heaven And Hell, The Mob Rules, TV Crimes, and the live (and superior to the studio) version of Children Of The Sea. As well as deeper cuts like Lonely Is The Word, Voodoo, and others. Each track has been remastered with Warner Bros original first generation tapes and they have never, and I mean NEVER, sounded this good ever! No edits, no goofy remixes, just the classic Black Sabbath sound most of us grew up on, just louder and crisper than ever before. Just as how the Black Sabbath/Ozzy era release \\"The Black Box\\" received superior & proper remastering, \\"The Dio Years\\" seem to have been given the exact same attention. Thank you, thank you Rhino for that!<br /><br />And if that wasn't enough, the original Mob Rules line-up (including Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and drummer Vinny Appice) recorded new songs! Not just one, or two, but THREE brand new tracks, making this Best Of to any Sabbath fan a must buy! The Devil Cried, Shadow Of The Wind, and Ear In The Wall, all written and recorded around late 2006 show that these guys still have alot of power left in them, sounding just like where they left off in 92's Dehumanizer. And they'll need that strength too, as most already know that they are currently on tour as \\"Heaven And Hell\\" to promote this release along with the 5000 only pressing of Rhino Handmade's \\"Live At The Hammersmith Odeon 1981\\" release due in early May. It's good to see this line-up finally get it's due, especially after a decade of overshadowing by the original Ozzy Osbourne version, which quite frankly, needed a break.<br /><br />Oh and before I go, I dare anyone who thinks Black Sabbath is \\"only Ozzy\\" to purchase this, give it a listen, and you WILL see that The Dio Years WERE just as important! I couldn't imagine Black Sabbath without those classic Dio led albums.<br /><br />No true Black Sabbath fan ever would.e been given the exact same attention. Thank you, thank you Rhino for that!

B000NA77YO|3.0|NO! You're wrong! I'm not an Ozzy diehard about to trash your favorite period in Sabbath's history! Quite the opposite: I'm a MASSIVE Dio fan who's disappointed by THIS collection. But in fairness, I'd say that no matter what the band and label would have done, I wouldn't have been satisfied...when this compilation was first announced, it was supposed to be a double CD, which immediately made me think \\"oh boy, they're really going to be stretching it thin, there...\\" I mean: a 2 cd anthology for a band that ONLY has 3 cds? Not a good idea...<br /><br />But then it was announced that it would be a single disc with 2 new tracks, and THEN I thought \\"oh boy, they're gonna leave A LOT of good stuff out...\\", and finally it was announced that it would have not two but THREE new tracks, taking space away from the classics...don't get me wrong, the new music is great, but the whole reason why we're getting this compilation is because of the classics, right? And when the song list was released...I was truly heartbroken... Let's use plain math, shall we? Since a CD can hold some 80 minutes of music, and most Sabbath songs clock in at 4-5 minutes, that would mean that around 16-17 songs could be shoehorned in...with the original plan for 2 new songs, that would've meant 14-15 classics...for the sake of argument, let's say 15... 15 songs out of 3 CD's...5 songs each, which I felt would've been a fair representation of those albums (that I absolutely love, by the way...)...<br /><br />But noooooo...instead, we get 5 songs off \\"Heaven and Hell\\", 4 from \\"The Mob Rules\\", one from \\"Live Evil\\" and ONLY 3 off \\"Dehumanizer\\"...Let me be perfectly blunt about this: I HATE LIVE STUFF ON COMPILATIONS!!! I don't care what band or what song it is, I JUST HATE IT!!! If at least they had included a rare, unreleased live song from the upcoming \\"Live at the Hammersmith Odeon\\", such as \\"Country Girl\\" or \\"Slipping Away\\"... but nooooo... you think I'm full of it, right? Well, I hate to burst the bubble for ya, but here's a reality check: the Walmart version of this release includes a bonus DVD called \\"Hangin' with Heaven & Hell\\" which features none other than Ronnie, Tony and Geezer TRASHING \\"Live Evil\\", saying how much of a crappy record they think it is (I strongly disagree) and how much overdubbing was done to it... nice to finally get the truth... 25 YEARS LATE!!! so, can anyone make any sense out of this? why include a song from a record that you hate? and then the rest of the song list...<br /><br />oh boy... there isn't much to say about the selection, though, since the guys themselves picked up the tunes, so THIS is the way they chose to represent themselves...but c'mon, WHY, OH WHY, include \\"Neon Knights\\" and \\"Turn up the Night\\"? It just doesn't make sense!!! At least they didn't include \\"Over and Over\\", because that would've been a terrible idea having already included \\"Lonely is the Word\\"...But why include a live tune? And why \\"Children of the Sea\\"? I mean, whatever happened to tracks such as \\"Sign of the Southern Cross\\", \\"Computer God\\", \\"Time Machine\\", \\"Buried Alive\\", etc, to mention but a few? In the case of \\"...Cross\\", this is (at least...) the THIRD time the song is \\"overlooked\\": first in \\"Live Evil\\", which only included a bit of it as part of the meddley; then in Dio's \\"Holy Diver Live\\", where, AGAIN, the song is presented in incomplete form in a meddley, and now here... I know for a fact that \\"After All (The Dead)\\" is one of Ronnie's favorite tracks off \\"Dehumanizer\\", but does that really justify its inclusion here, when other jewels were left out? Anyway, that's just my point of view...you're free to disagree (and I'm sure many of you will...)...but I just felt like I had to vent it... Now it's done...<br /><br />The Bottom line: if you don't have anything from this configuration of Sabbath and you don't want to buy all four records...well, I guess you don't have a choice! This is it! It's a good compilation, and if you like what you find here, you'll LOVE the other CD's. At least the songs are included in their full album lenght, as opposed to the Ozzy era \\"Greatest Hits\\" album released some time ago... But if you're a Dio nut like me...you probably don't need this because you already have the albums...save for the new songs... (LEGALLY!!!) download them, then... I mean, give me a break: even the people that give this CD 5 stars agree that there are key songs missing...so which one is it? Do you love it, or don't you? Too bad they didn't really work out a great package (all four remastered CD's, for instance...) instead of just a good CD...least the songs are included in their full album lenght, as opposed to the Ozzy era \\"Greatest Hits\\" album released some time ago...

B000002TQV|5.0|Think about it.  When have you ever heard a bad song from Radiohead?  I am not an uber die hard Radiohead fan, but I've heard most of their music and I haven't EVER heard a bad song by this band.  This is my favorite of the Radiohead CD's.  JUST is their best tune IMHO.  <br />
B000G759LW|5.0|Combine old swing jazz with a truly great vocal talent and you get this album. While there have been several songs from some of Christina's earlier albums that I've enjoyed, this is the first album of her's that I've enjoyed enough to buy for the whole album. Not just one or two tracks. Hope to see her continue to produce albums like this where she can completely express her great vocal talent.
B00005LC4B|4.0|Max Cady (Robert DeNiro), a violent criminal, stalks his former defense lawyer, Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte), who he blames for his fourteen year sentence for rape.  He is not entirely wrong, since Bowden buried a report on the victim's promiscuity out of certainty that Cady was guilty.  Nobody is entirely innocent in Martin Scorsese's remake of a film noir thriller from the 60s.  This moral complexity and intense work from the talented cast, which includes Jessica Lange and Juliette Lewis, make for an involving suspense film.  A major drawback, though, is Scorsese himself, who indulges in some jarringly self-conscious effects and choppy pacing.  These flaws become less apparent as the film builds momentum toward its powerful climax.  Strangely, this film from one of our most talented directors features the most egregious example of product placement I have ever seen.  Joe Don Baker's bottle of Pepto Bismol is so prominent that it should have received fourth billing in the credits.
B000LXH0AE|1.0|That's exactly how this movie left me feeling. Separately, all the actors in this movie are gifted, and I enjoy them, but put them together and all you get is a slow, left of center movie that at the end of the day, just doesn't work. It's a shame too because this movie had nothing but possibilities, yet failed to live up to any of them. Better luck next time.
B00006AUIG|4.0|\\"Session 9\\" was recommended by a friend, and I found it really creepy. And that is high praise. I don't get scared easily. Now when someone says \\"I need a scary movie for Friday night\\", I recommend this one.<br /><br />However, it takes its sweet time (which I enjoy), and introduces you to the characters and location gradually. I will not spoil anything by giving away story details. Suffice to say that a small group of men are cleaning up an old, abandoned mental hospital, and things begin to get strange.<br /><br />This is now easily one of my favorite haunted house films. Those who have seen it understand when I refer to \\"the lightbulbs scene\\". Wow. Or just listening to the session tapes gets under your skin fiercely.<br /><br />This is not a slasher film, or a splattery mess of gore. Oh, it does get a bit gruesome. But this movie is more about what is hinted at, or what might happen. Like 'The Shining', 'Alien', or 'Don't Look Now', this movie makes you feel a deep sense of unease, which soon becomes dread.<br /><br />The stuff of nightmares. Recommended.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|Brandi Carlile has been on the periphery of my radar for a few months now, and The Story has permanently converted me to one of the faithful. I keep playing the title track over and over again, just can't get this song out of my head. The sheer emotional power rips through your soul like an out-of-control freight train, stirring up heartache, lost love and painful past memories -- yet is healing and bittersweet all at once. And when the Hanseroth twins double-barrel power chords come crashing in on the chorus, the song just plain shreds. This ain't no bubblegum pop. The talent, wisdom, loss, torment and life experience present in her vocals contradicts her 23 years, and it appears that she has successfully channeled the spirit of Patsy Cline for a new generation. Thank you Brandi, I sincerely wish you a long and rewarding career. And for all of you listeners hungry for something different, do yourself a favor and buy this album right now -- as well as her excellent debut.
B000NJWJCA|5.0|This is the '2007 Australian Tour Edition'....the cover has the same pic of P!nk as the standard version of I'm Not Dead, but a RED background. The font on the cover is all in gold. the CD features 3 bonus tracks, fingers, who knew (the bimbo jones radio edit), u + ur hand (beatcult club mix). they are great tracks, and the dvd is awesome, has all the videos from the CD, as well as the new vids for her new double a side single leave me alone, both are live, and the MTV making of the video for stupid girls & u + ur hand. they are fun to watch. this is definatley worht the price. it is a collectors edition. this is P!nk's best album yet. and if you don't have this cd yet, buy this version.
B00005JL0I|2.0|What a mess of the royal proportions - such a great cast (Peter Sellers, David Niven, Orson Welles, Woody Allen, Ursula Andress, Deborah Kerr, and Jean-Paul Belmondo), the James Bond's story, plenty of beautiful (and I mean it) girls, the music by Burt Bacharach, most famous sets - but the movie is almost totally unwatchable. It started funny enough - at Sir James Bond's (David Niven) home where he was approached by four international agents that forced him to come out of retirement and head up the operation against the evil organization SMERSH. His mission is to destroy Topple LeChiffre (Orson Welles} at the baccarat tables where he never loses and wins a lot of money to supply SMERSH. Then, the movie becomes silly, stupid, pointless, and (what is the worst) not funny. Only Woody Allen, (as Bond's incompetent nephew, Jimmy Bond) brilliant as usual has appeared in two scenes and made them silly and hilarious. I think that \\"Casino Royale\\" (the way it was made) illustrates the fact that bigger is not always better - overlong and overblown, written and directed by five or more writers and directors, it brings to mind an old saying, \\"Too many cooks spoil the broth\\".<br /><br />OT: the abbreviation SMERSH really existed during the WWII. It means \\"Death to the Spies\\" in Russian.

B000FVQM2Y|3.0|\\"Brick\\" (2005) written/directed by Rian Johnson is a film  made as a noir of the 40s which takes place in a modern day LA's high school. It is stylish, very dark, and even funny sometimes. Watching all the young actors playing noir archetypes \\"talking the talk and walking the walk\\" was amusing. I liked a lot Joseph Gordon-Levitt (after \\"Mysterious Skin\\" I promised myself to watch his new movies - he is very talented) as a loner private eye with a broken heart who set to find out the circumstances of his ex-girlfriend's murder. Grown-up Lucas Haas stars as a powerful drug lord who still lives with his mom. I had to watch the movie with the subtitles on - I had no idea what was told quite often. Not, like it prevented me from figuring out where the story was heading to way before the movie was over. Interesting - yes. Great - not so sure but it was fun to watch.
B000OLV97I|1.0|The book was awesome. The Movie called eragon was a jumpy action flick that made little to no sense. Since when do elves not have pointy ears and when did dwarves get so tall? In no way does the movie follow the book. You will be wondering if the director read the book. The worst part is the beginning 200 pages smashed into 10 minutes. If the book didnt have an action scene in a chapter it was skipped. The worst part about the making of this movie is that its so terrible people who see it and havent read the book will think that the book must be just as bad. A weak adaptation of a brilliant young minds work.
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|This is my second skagen titanium watch and both are great products. I have one silver and the latest is black.  Both watches wear and feel great when worn, they look sleek and nice while being very durable, and yes, they keep excellent time.  I am very impressed with the quality and will definitely have Skagen in mind when it's time to purchase another watch.  You will love this watch.  You can wear it for style, for dress and casual; it's a good fit for all occassions.
1400032717|5.0|This book is so great. It told from the point of view of a child with autism. Both my mom and I work with children who have autism, and we both felt like it was a very realistic book. Some of the reviewers said that they were disappointed because the ending was too obvious, but I feel like that was the whole point. It's not a 'mystery' to anyone but Christopher. It's a very short, easy read and I think most people would enjoy it.
B000NDIAWO|5.0|I am going to make this brief, I love this version compared to the original release. I thought that the original fell flat compared to anything that Beyonce has ever done. The deluxe edition is the version she should have release in the first place...Just Excellent!
0307237699|5.0|Senator Obama's book is a highly literate, immensely honest account of his life, his hopes for America, and a view of the world, which is broad and challenging. Further, he presents his experience as a politician in such an honest, candid way that inspires trust. I can't say that about many politicians--ever.
B00005JMFQ|2.0|A lot of people like this film. So I 'm staking my reputation saying I didn't. Richard Curtis had a great success with 4 Weddings and a Funeral. Here he just doubles the number and hopes it will work. I don't like this film for several reasons. 1. It is coy 2. It is is disingenuous. 3. It is trying - as so many do and so few succeed - to repeat a formula. <br /> <br />There' s really nothing about this film that is REAL. The dialog is for the most part awful. Just one example, a twelve year old boy, in love with a girl at school, told she is going away, is given the line to his father, \\"It's the end of my life AS I KNOW IT\\". I could cite a dozen or more examples of this sort of artificiality, but I'll spare everyone's blushes. Richard Curtis is not a great screenwriter. He had one success with \\" 4 Weddings\\" and that ( judging from this ) is it. His earlier British TV comedies like Blackadder for example were full of embarrassing moments. If you want genuinely funny and consistent romantic comedy, stick to Woody Allen.
B000GPIPT2|4.0|I remember watching this movie for the first time as a kid and being scared to death for weeks afterwards!  <br /> <br />Revisiting this classic movie as an adult, I still feel that Boris Karloff is the best actor in this \\"Frankenstein\\" classic movie, whereas the rest of the cast of actors (with the exception of Dwight Frye who played Fritz, Dr. Frankenstein's hunchbacked assistant) aren't that great in their roles in this movie!  <br /> <br />The make-up for Karloff's character in \\"Frankenstein\\" was fabulously done and the set design and camera work for the time were excellent too. <br /> <br />I think the real monster of this movie isn't Karloff's character, but that of Dr. Frankenstein himself. How do you bring someone to life and then chain/lock him up and treat him poorly? Of course you'll create a so called \\"monster\\" by doing this! Interesting topic of nature verses nurture comes to mind when watching this movie.
074356619X|5.0|A friend let me borrow the DVD of The Secret. It totally blew me away. I immediately bought the DVD, the CD set and the book. The Secret says in a nutshell what I have been taught from other famous authors over the years, \\"We become what we think about.\\" The Bible, A Course in Miracles and many other Spiritual writings concure with what is taught in The Secret. This is a must read, hear or see. The CD set has more detail than the DVD. If you don't do anything else important this year, buy The Secret. Thank you Rhonda Byrne.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|I really enjoyed this new James Bond movie a lot more than I thought I would. Lots of action and special effects coupled with a nice storyline made this a good James Bond film.  <br /> <br />I am not sure that I am completely sold on Daniel Craig as the new \\"James Bond\\".... he seems to be a good actor, however unlike many of his predecessors, Sean Connery, Roger Moore, and Pierce Brosnan, Craig lacks the suaveness & sex appeal his predecessors gave the \\"James Bond\\" character. Craig brings a tougher, colder James Bond to the screen for the most part. <br /> <br />Also, the storyline was a bit predictable as I had figured out that Vesper Lynd was going to be a traitor in this movie long before hand, which makes it disappointing when one can figure out the storyline in advance.

0440238609|1.0|I don't recommend these books to anyone. The first book is certainly well written, and pulls you in. It's fascinating and very interesting. Towards the end of the first book weighty matters fly thick and fast. By the end, I wondered how it had been marketed as a children's book. It is NOT for kids. The second book just dissolved into blasphemy. The third book, as has been said in other reviews, was definitely the least good of the three. Certain death scenes weren't exactly consistent with the characters involved, and the ending really could have been better. As to morals, they were sadly lacking. I didn't see much of the behavior as being terribly honorable or noteworthy, though the author tried to paint it that way. Instead of focusing on the story Philip Pullman used the books as a rant against God. That is his prerogative, of course, but I think it's good to know what one's child is reading. You know, in case it contains issues that are better suited to an older audience, as these books do (souls being ripped from children's bodies, 12 year olds having sex, etc.). If the author had focused more on the story, instead of his manifesto, the second two books might have been better, even with the blasphemous content. The books ARE well-written, and I enjoyed reading them. The author's agenda didn't exactly rock my faith, but I most definitely don't recommend them. (Side note: I was 16 when I read this series and my opinion hasn't changed in the intervening years.)<br /><br />I read these books several years ago, so I don't remember in exactly which book the wheel-using animals come in, but after that I just finished the series for the principle of the thing. I thought they were rather stupid. (Note: My friend, who introduced me to these books, and is much smarter than I, loved the wheel-using animals, so maybe it was just me, but I thought they were utterly idiotic.) I can't emphasize enough that these are not books for children. There is a certain image from, I believe, the second book that crops up in my mind every once in a while that still disturbs me, and, like I said, I read these books quite a while ago.<br /><br />These books will never darken my door if I can help it. Yes, it's just a series of children's books, but I think it is wise to know what one's child is reading. There is subject matter that warrants discussion (like God, death, sex). There are better books out there to spend money on, with rationally written ideas in them.second book that crops up in my mind every once in a while that still disturbs me, and, like I said, I read these books quite a while ago.

B000MRA5EM|4.0|This DVD is focused explisitedly on the ocean where no one has been before to film beautiful creatures of the deep.The IMAX effect though is somewhat lost because of TV size. The film seemed short to me ,although well done. Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet do a good job narrating but in end is message to save our seas , which makes more a documentary than entertaining film.
0072435097|4.0|the one brief section that felt forced (dwelling on the significance of the ink used to sign a check) helped emphasize what is so effectively authentic about the writing of this novel generally. the origins and implications of an event are both presented as having equal substance, it never seems like something is just a bridge to get to a meaningful predecided outcome. aside from an occasional flaunted apathy to animal rights it's a good book.

He did do any pet peaves that other writers used to! I Looooove this book!<br />-------<br />Update:06/15/2012 (or a Mature Version of the Review)<br /><br />I still very much love this book, I did like the fact that unlike the movie, we at least get to see the aftermath of what happened after Tonya's rape and the effect that it had on her and her family. Although Jake's character in the Book is a lot more unsympthic in the book than in the movie (since he really cares more about the publicity than anything else).

B00007L4OM|5.0|This is a great movie! Wasabi is about a police detective (played by Reno) who has to travel to Tokyo in order to sort out his past when he learns that the only woman he has ever loved has died. If you are a big fan of Jean Reno you will really enjoy this movie. It has a great combination of action and humor and is a good addition to a movie collection. I highly recommend this film if you are looking for a mixture of action and fun, especially if you are a fan of anything by Jean Reno.
1582701709|3.0|The graphic work is second to none. I have read extensively in the new thought arena  (Christian Larson, Thomas Troward, Ernest Holmes and more) Why is there not a word about  Ernest Holmes who influenced the first half of the 20th century with the Science of Mind, and at least 18 other books dealing with the aspects of what the author terms SECRET. She honors those with whom I am not familiar, she did her home work. Many of those she quotes would have known or known of Ernest Holmes. <br /> <br />Carl Rosen

B00005221M|5.0|This is a breathtaking movie on several levels.  One, the scenery is stunning.  Two, the pace of action is unrelenting.  Third, there is considerable emotional wallop to the movie. Fourth, characters are drawn in such a way as to create real interest in the unfolding drama. Fifth, the sound track, by Randy Edelman, is most affecting.<br /><br />In some senses, the movie is \\"over the top.\\"  Some of the heroic deeds by, for example, Nathaniel, are almost unbelievable (firing two muskets simultaneously while on the run and hitting two antagonists).  Other scenes could also be adduced in like manner.  But, in a larger sense, it does not really matter.  This is a larger than life film.<br /><br />The three way relationship between Nathaniel (Natty Bumppo, the Pathfinder, \\"La longue carabine,\\" etc.: Played by Daniel Day-Lewis), his adoptive father Chingachgook (played by AIM leader Russell Means in a compelling manner), and the latter's natural son, Uncas, is well played.<br /><br />There is a great villain, Magua.  There is the ambiguous French general, Montcalm.  Was he complicit with Magua in the massacre after the fort's surrender?  Or was he an unwitting dupe to the latter's vengeance?  The scenes between the two of them are interesting, in that it is not clear at the end where Montcalm stands.<br /><br />There are the dual love stories: the ill-fated proto-relationship between Uncas and General Munro's young daughter Alice; the more mature, slowly developing relationship between Nathaniel and Alice's older sister, Cora.<br /><br />The action scenes, from the siege of the fort, to the massacre of the English troops, to the final conflict, with Chingachgook getting revenge, are compelling and well staged.<br /><br />Whenever I watch this movie, I am overcome by an array of emotions as the drama unfolds.  I am not so concerned with some of the issues regarding the Director's cut as others are.  Whichever version one sees, it will be a fine theatrical event.  I recommend this unhesitatingly as a fine work.d this unhesitatingly as a fine work.
B00005JPCF|4.0|Many customers consider reviews before making a purchase. If ratings are consistently positive or negative, they have a good idea of the film's value. Occasionally such reviews, like polar caps, form on two ends of the spectrum. I used to rate everything -- not just movies -- as either totally great or absolutely horrible. After reading a helpful [[ASIN:0684849631 book]] and later, studying [[ASIN:0387948074 fuzzy logic]] for a programming project, I realized that the world is not just black and white. Even Penguins have gray.     Taking a purely mathematical approach and averaging the results of extremes, one finds that the sweet spot is somewhere in the middle. HAPPY FEET, with its polar votes, must be averaged at three. From here, personal sensibilities have a profound effect. Notice how preconceived expectations, personal morality, and environment affect overall impression.     Though mating and song are motivation for the preservation of life in penguins and most animals, anthropomorphism in animation of the same with innuendoes makes it appear vulgar (even if they are only rubbing necks) -- offending one's sense of morality. Parents assuming 'all animation is good for kids' might be surprised when, after viewing the film with small children, they discover, as mentioned beneath the MPAA rating, \\"Mild Peril and Rude Humor\\" is really in the film. Therefore, to justify preconceived expectations, they must deduct a point from the average. Someone exposed to racial stereotyping can be offended because a Caucasian comedian provides voiceovers for a character with an [[ASIN:B0000714BQ East L.A.]] Spanish accent or because a particularly dark penguin named Lovelace acts and sounds like a sanctimonious Barry White (which may be a play on the animal's actual colors). Those who look to animation as a diversion from world problems may be disturbed when a social issue rears its ugly head. Expect anyone in these groups to rate the film less than three.     On the other hand,more lighthearted viewers who love song, dance or cute and cuddly animals add points to the average. Perhaps there are no children in the home or they may be impressed by the quality of animation. Favorite songs may bring back fond memories. Hence, we have reviews nearing the maximum number of favorable votes.    When I saw HAPPY FEET, it first appeared to be an animated version of [[ASIN:B000BI5KV0 MARCH OF THE PENGUINS]]. The singing, dancing, and humor eases acceptance of positive moral and social issues. Years ago, the intent of animation was to \\"characterize\\" subjects; with exaggerated features, they were supposed to look funny. Today's high-tech CGI animation can be both impressive and intimidating when animation migrates to reality. In my opinion, as an artist myself, Warner Bros. swung the pendulum too far with frighteningly realistic rendering of the killer whale and various seals with near-death experiences. I agree with others that the plot has too many directions. There's the whole story of how penguins use unique song to find their mates after long periods of deprivation; prejudice for not being able to do what everyone else does and for looking different is depicted; \\"[[ASIN:B00003CXB4 the circle of life]]\\" as animals prey on one another, the pollution of oceans, man's encroachment on ecosystems by stripping marine life of its food source, and captivity of animals is all there. Whew! The veil of humor made it easier to accept but I personally felt somewhat exhausted after my first viewing. So the vote, based solely on my opinion, does not stray from the center.     However, another member of this household absolutely LOVED IT -- going to the theater three times and being personally responsible for at least 15 movie tickets. Her insistence moved me to purchase the DVD so it must have redeeming qualities worth another point -- hence the total vote of four stars.     What I get from all this is that your enjoyment of the film cannot be based on someone else's sensibilities. Learn the facts about the film (as I have attempted to objectively provide) and make a determination based on your background whether it appeals to you.
B000KC8O3S|5.0|A lot of people have complained about Murray Gold's music for the new sereis of Doctor Who since it has returned.  I don't know what people are complaining about.  I think the album is excellent and love the swells from pieces such as Rose's Theme to The Lone Dalek (also used in The Satan Pit when Rose is reunited with the Doctor at the end). <br /> <br />Of course, my favorite is the timeless theme tune which Gold does a masterful \\"feature length\\" rendition at the end.
B000NVIGC0|4.0|It was nearly impossible to please everyone with A Ghost is Born, the follow-up to the moving and extraordinary Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.  Personally, I loved 2 tracks from AGIB, bit I can't remember the others.  Well, I listened to Sky Blue Sky yesterday...and then again today, and the songs here are not only more memorable, but they mark progress in Wilco's shift from alt-country to a kind of alt-soul.  This album is part John Lennon, part Eagles, and part Pink Floyd, and it is gorgeous.  Jeff Tweedy is definitely in a John Lennon phase, and his voice is as good here as it was on YHF.  This will be played a lot during summer evenings in my house.  It's a true album when the first and last tracks make perfect sense and sound so right.    I know we're despirate for quality American rock music.  There was a time (1990-1995) when you could easily say that REM, Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins, Galaxie 500/Luna, Sonic Youth, Perl Jam, Living Colour, Tool, and The Pixies were among the best.  Nowadays, I have to stop and think.  But with Wilco and Interpol both releasing albums this spring, I am back into celebrating what we Americans have.     Now finish that new album, Radiohead!  These guys beat you to market.

0786838655|4.0|This book has alot going for it.  Wonderful narrator/main character Percy.  He's a very engaging voice and really makes you want to keep reading.  It is a very fast paced book and is chock full of Greek mythology.<br /><br />However, I have one HUGE problem with it.  Which I keep hoping will be explained in subsequent books (wasn't in the second).  One of the main characters, Annabeth, who is a pretty neat character, is the daughter of Athena.  Riordan seems to be very well versed in greek mythology, he has some great allusions and everything else, to the best of my memory is correct.  But Athena??  She was one of the maiden godesses, she had no children, really had no lovers either, she admired a few men and kept them as close compainions but no kiddies! I just don't understand where this idea of Athena as a mother comes from.<br /><br />Its great for kids who are on the level of the first Harry Potter book, there is some violence but its not really glorified and its not overly disturbing.  Overall its just a fun adventure tale.

B000NA77YO|5.0|With todays slop that they try to pass off as ROCK AND ROLL, this CD is a breath of fresh air.  Who cares if it is only one CD insead of a two CD set? It rocks from beginning to end with alot of my favorites.  Plus you get all of these tracks for $9.99.  It's nice to see a new CD for a reasonable price with all of the overpriced CD's out there today.  Ronnie James Dio's voice just gets better with time, I'm refering to the 3 new tracks on this album.  The rest of the band sounds awesome as well.  Hopefully we will get a new studio album in the works with Dio and Black Sabbath.  I'm glad there are legends like this keeping Rock alive!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is the most beautiful and respectful of all Jane Austen's adaptations. <br />The acting is brilliant. Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds show the subtle intensity and restrained passion that finally errupts quietly and meaningfully to none but them. To think that it was written at a time when Jane Austen was suffering the unbearable syptoms of cancer and to have written such a positive story! Sometimes I think she (the author) placed in this her final novel all she wished her life to have been. Jane was Anne. I cannot think she would have found it possible to have written this story any other way. Anyone who has read the novel knows the director has made all the right choices to be true to the story, from the art direction, to the the settings to the music. The director had a clear vision and knew exactly how he wanted the audience to \\"feel\\" this film. Such honesty and respect to a literary work is seldom, if ever seen. When at last their ship sails into the sunset, many a time tears have sprung from my eyes.

0566076896|5.0|SPIN Selling was based on research done by Neil Rackham on thousands of salespeople in several countries over an extensive period of time. The results of the research provided an insight into how the best salespeople operate. Like the discovery of NLP in the 1970's then SPIN techniques were already being used in the field, they just hadn't been broken down and named so they weren't being taught as such.<br /><br />Even before SPIN most salespeople knew that they ought to ask questions and listen more (\\"Two ears, one mouth\\"!) but many perhaps did not know where to go with their questions to get the most effective results. Rackham for example explains how after speaking with many decision makers he discovered that simple Situation based questions can turn a decision maker off as they feel that they are educating the salesperson. Previously most salespeople may well have believed that these were building rapport!<br /><br />In the SPIN methodology Rackham outlines how the salesperson should progress from Situation questions to Problem questions to Implication questions to Needs questions. This method is well explained and easily executable by someone with reasonable intelligence and a commitment to practising the techniques. The material will need tailoring for the individual and the industry however this would be expected with any methodology aimed at salespeople in general. Purchasing the SPIN Selling Fieldbook at the same time is worthwhile and will certainly help you to do this as it gets you to create your own questions and is full of tests and checks to ensure that you really have understoood the concepts and can apply them.<br /><br />SPIN Selling is in my opinion a MUST READ for salespeople as the vast majority of sales systems in the marketplace today span off from SPIN (despite what some of them might say!). If you haven't got your own copy of SPIN then you should get one and read it.<br /><br />Footnote: Some peoople deride SPIN saying that it is now outdated and has been improved upon. I disagree. True there are other options out there including my own \\"Ingham Sales System\\" and these systems are all slightly different with different structuring and key points however... I would still recommend all salespeople to read SPIN. If there were \\"must-read\\" texts for salespeople this book would still be in my top 10.disagree.

A co-worker suggested the Head First series and I was DELIGHTED with the presentation of information. This book presents the same information that the 10,000 other beginner-Java books present, but with stories, pictures, games, puzzles, fun dialogues, jokes and a series of challenges that stimulate your brain in a whole new way. Unlike other technical books, sitting down and reading this one cover-to-cover was a lot of FUN. Plus, I walked away with a solid understanding of many of the basics.<br /><br />I now use it as a reference and refresher manual that has come in handy more than once.<br /><br />The only thing I would like to see improved is that the Index in the back could be a little more comprehensive. But I can live with a mediocre Index if I walk away with a new set of skills and a ton of confidence in my new job.

0316010669|5.0|Most of us have had those moments in life, when we have made a decision in snap; probably because of lack of time as in an emergency or we heard an inner voice prompting us to take that decision. At a later date, we can not actually justify or explain as to how we were able to reach such a brilliant decision in almost no time at all. This book is all about those decisions taken in a blink. <br /> <br />The book gives a fair treatment to the topic and talks about those snap-decisions, which were successful and it talks about those, which were disastrous as well. It also talks about in order to understand a person you don't need to spend a good amount of time with him/her; instead, a thin slice of interaction with that person will be good enough. The book comes up with lot many surprising and paradoxical statements and then  gives logical and scientific explanations for the same. As an example consider this - \\"we are a bit too quick to come up with explanations, for things we really don't have explanations for\\". <br /> <br />The book, by any stretch of imagination, is not a step-by-step guide on how to make better snap decisions or how to replace your elaborate decision making processes with snap decisions. It does talk about how a snap decisions based on our pre-judgements can have disastrous results. One very startling conclusion made by the book is \\"information overload  prevents you from not only taking a quick decision but even a correct decision\\". Now this is contrary to our belief \\"more informed you are, better are your decisions\\". <br /> <br />Where it is even difficult to write a paragraph or two about our intuitive decision making ability, the book really does a commendable job in discussing various aspects of it in such vivid detail. The book is full of examples which make it a very interesting read. At the end, you come up with more respect and trust for your intuition and suddenly you have discovered a new friend in form of your inner voice. <br />

6305313687|5.0|The fear of foreign races or people, and it evolving into an actual phobia, an intense and irrational dread, in other terms, racism, has been around since primitive man began forming tribes, millions of years ago. American History X examines racism in the context of present day neo-Nazism, and similar to the German Nazis of the 30's and 40's all foreigners are blamed for everything wrong with the State. The solution to unemployment, a high cost of living, rocketing welfare and rising crime is to jettison all immigrants, foreigners, from the country so that the original people, the white's in America or the Aryan race in 30's Germany can flourish as they are truly destined to do. This notion is one of the foundational tenets of fascism, and added to this, violence and war is the only method to achieve a `pure' flourishing State.<br /><br />American History X is a strong film presenting the arguments for the Right and the Left where, for the most part, the propositions on both sides have valid points, however, it is impossible to argue a subject as complex as immigration, rising crime and the cost of living by blaming these situations on a particular race of people. In fact, the argument is absurd because there are always exceptions, and as this important film points out with force and powerful emotion, racism is about hate, fear and personal anger, projected on a generality because it is convenient, a scapegoat for a lack of control and responsibility.<br /><br />Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) is an intelligent young man but somewhere along the line began to hate Black American's, Asian American's et al, and under the tutelage of an older and influential White Supremist, (Stacy Keach), becomes the leader of a `skinhead' gang in Venice Beach, trashing foreign owned grocery stores to finally be jailed for the brutal murder of two teenaged Black Americans because they attempted to steal his car. Derek is strong, passionate, and terribly angry and now, a cold blooded killer and his younger brother, Danny, (Edward Furlong) idolises him.<br /><br />Edward Furlong as Danny was perfect casting as he has a sensitive and forlorn, lost gaze, almost innocent because he loves his brother so much, and when his brother is released from prison with a different point of view, at first goes a little crazy, but will go along because he worships and loves him. Of course this makes the ending that much more forbidding and terribly moving. Furlong is a talented actor and is restrained in this picture, resulting in his performance being totally believable.<br /><br />A film about such a controversial subject matter cannot avoid presenting a message for the viewer.

075640407X|4.0|In a nutshell, The Name of the Wind recounts the tale of Kvothe, a young man destined to become the most powerful wizard the world has ever seen. It begins with Kvothe's childhood years, first as a member of a traveling troupe of musicians and artists, and then as a street urchin forced to fend for himself in a violent environment. Later, the story shifts to his adolescence, at a time when he is admitted to the University, renowned school of magic.    Reading along, I found the structure of the story a little odd. The better part of the novel is comprised of Kvothe's back story, with only a few scenes occurring in \\"real time.\\" Having never encountered something like it, I discussed it with Betsy Wollheim. She did shine some light on the matter, and it turns out that Rothfuss' first trilogy will focus on the main character's past, with occasional tantalizing hints of things to come. A second trilogy will then recount Kvothe's \\"present\\" tale.    The Name of the Wind is told in a first person narrative. Hence, other than those \\"real time\\" segments told in the third person, most of the book is told from Kvothe's perspective. Those who have a problem with single-POV narratives similar to that of Robin Hobb's The Farseer and The Tawny Man trilogies, consider yourselves warned. The main danger in using the first person narrative is that the entire story rests on the shoulder of a single character. If you like Kvothe, terrific. If you don't, that's where it gets tricky. I had no problem with that facet of the novel, but I'm acutely aware that some readers don't care much for the first person perspective.    The worldbuilding doesn't play a big role in this debut. And yet, Rothfuss hints at a much vaster depth, hopefully to be explored in future sequels. The author has an eye for details, and the story does come alive as you turn the pages. The magic system appears to be well thought of and interesting, and I'm eager to learn more about it.    The Name of the Wind is a character-driven book. As a first person narrative, it can't be anything but that. The supporting cast is composed of a relatively small number of characters, which is rather rare for a book of this size. I'm looking forward to learning more about them in the upcoming installments.    The novel suffers from only one flaw -- a flaw shared by various Daw books: it's too long. I feel that Rothfuss' attention to details slows the pace in several portions of the book. I feel that some scenes could have been truncated and others excised without the readers missing out on any major plotlines. In my opinion, this would quicken the rhythm and improve the overall quality of the book.    Unlike some debuts that are not easily accessible -- Hal Duncan's Vellum and Steven Erikson's Gardens of the Moon come to mind -- I'm persuaded that The Name of the Wind can appeal to both neophytes and long-time fans of the genre. As such, it's similar to both Brandon Sanderson's Elantris and Joe Abercrombie's The Blade Itself in that regard. It's also a throwback work, which brought fantasy novels likes Raymond E. Feist's Magician and David Eddings' Pawn of the Prophecy to mind.    Although a bit overlong, The Name of the Wind is a solid and ambitious effort. Two years ago I would have claimed that it could well be the debut of the year. But Hal Duncan and Scott Lynch have forced us to look at debuts in a different way. Still, Patrick Rothfuss wrote an auspicious debut, and I'm curious to discover the rest of Kvothe's tale.    [...]

And if a CD or book isn't selling, it's gone. They only have room for the gig hits.<br /><br />The only problem is that the hits today rarely sell in the quantities they used to. People are finding the products they really want, ant the net is the facilitator. Our society is quickly leaving the mode of only buying the Billboard top 40 and the NY Times bestseller books. This brings forth a new business model.<br /><br />Amazon also sells the hits, but they carry thousands upon thousands of books and CDs that are not popular. But somewhere out there, someone wants a book on the most obscure subjects, or a piece of music that few would ever venture into. Amazon has lowered the cost of carrying nearly all the available titles, so even if something sells one copy a quarter, they can still make money on it. Multiply this times millions of titles, and you have a big aggregate revenue number.<br /><br />Downloadable products, such as mp3 files and ebooks have almost no cost to carry and list. These companies have huge margins and huge inventories.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this book is most helpful to people who can build a business that follows this model. Carry \\"all\\" the products in a market, and you will increase your chances of success enormously. If you are creating a product that occupies the Long Tail portion of the market, this book won't help you sell more product. For that, read books on viral marketing.

1591396190|1.0|I absolutely agree with the last comment. Except for the good term 'value creation' I found nothing new.  <br /> <br />Saying brands have become less important as price has an influence on whether a customer buys Colgate or Crest is strange. (Both have significant brand equity). Also I think saying line extensions generate little revenue compared to entirely new produces is giving wrong impressions. The developing costs for new products and (possibly new sales channels) must be taken into account.  <br /> <br />I'm surprised about the hype and that so many people like it.

It's an ok album, but nothing really original here.
0151013047|5.0|In present day Pakistan, a bearded young man engages in a one-sided discussion with an American, a stranger, conversing through the afternoon and evening at a local caf&eacute;. In what is essentially a monologue, Changez, the protagonist, relates his recent past and disillusion with the American dream, the journey that has brought him to this place, time and fate.<br /><br />A Princeton graduate, Changez looks to a future without impediment, newly hired by a prestigious valuation firm. Although missing his family in Lahore, the twenty-two year old fits perfectly into Underwood Samson, New York City embracing him with its cosmopolitan ambiance, a Pakistani deli near his apartment, the occasional taxi driver who speaks Urdu. Returning from a vacation in Greece, where he has luxuriated in the wealth and privilege of fellow Princeton grads, Changez looks forward to a blooming romance with Erica, a wealthy beauty he met on the islands. Outstanding at his job, his single-mindedness and emotional detachment mark Changez as an employee to watch. While the relationship with Erica remains tentative after they return to the city, Changez is willing to wait, inured to the subtleties of male-female attraction by his culture. To his dismay, the once vivid Erica increasingly withdraws into her past with memories of a former lover, escaping into a world of fantasy.<br /><br />The shock of 9/11 doesn't immediately impact the Changez's life; dedicated, his work is exemplary, although he is ever more concerned with Erica's aberrant behavior. In the aftermath of the tragedy, a brief visit home is a stark reminder of the differences between the two worlds, Pakistan threatened by India, the United States taking no action to protect an ally in the war on terror. Returning to New York from Lahore, Changez finds that the atmosphere has altered, suddenly conscious of animosity directed at him, the formerly welcoming city turned cold, suspicious and vindictive: \\"I had always thought of America as a nation that looked forward; for the first time I was struck by its determination to look back.\\"<br /><br />Beautifully nuanced with fragile immigrant hopes and the tragic annihilation of a promising future, the author paints a provocative picture of post-9/11 reality. Changez is filled with rage, caught between cultures and questioning the great country that has so captured his imagination, his perceptions drastically affected by recent experience. A once unlimited future now truncated by circumstances, Changez questions the falsity of dreams and the danger of delusion: \\"It is not always possible to restore one's boundaries after they have been blurred and made permeable by a relationship.\\" Even his work is suspect, finance \\"a primary means by which the American empire exercised its power.\\" In this haunting story of unremitted passion and painful self-discovery, the personal and the political collide.

I had felt unworthy all of my life, but while I was reading this book I fell in love with myself. Not in an egotistical way, but in a good way. Guilt and insecurity changed in a few moments to a wonderful, spiritual kind of self acceptance.  An added  benefit is it provided a great comfort for my grief over lost loved ones and fascinating insight into the nature of the hereafter, as experienced by the author.

0786553804|2.0|I was somewhat enjoying Ms. Gilbert's book until pg 48 when she insulted Republicans by saying \\"they\\" stole a Presidential election. I was appalled by this. I am a certified yoga instructor and that is why I wanted to read this book, especially the part about India. During my yoga training, my fellow students had totally different political beliefs and opinions. We respected each other's right to have individual opinions -- something sadly missing in Ms. Gilbert's book. There are more digs about Republicans and conservative Christians throughout this book - which is completely antithetical to the practice of yoga and prayer. I was very disappointed by these cheap shots, and her assumptions and arrogance that her readers would agree with her.
B000MNP2KI|3.0|A ravishing lady told me Daniel Craig can play the role of a hired thug but not as Commander James Bond, 007, Royal Navy and MI6/SIS Intelligence Officer. I saw Casino Royale, and there is no argument that Daniel Craig is good actor who is a good sprinter too from his running scenes. What makes him unsuitable as Bond is his face, which to put it in a politically correct manner is aesthetically challenged. He has the wrinkles of a 50 year old in the body of a 38 year old. There are deep permanent frown lines between his eyes. He has big elephant ears and his neck is too short so in the scene of him in the Bahamas doing his version of Ursula Andress coming out of the sea a la Dr. No (1962), he looks like a turtle. Also his enthusisatic weight lifting has made him look grotesque as if he is on steroids. Daniel also has a very bad habit of pouting and sticking out his lower lip in a very unpleasant manner. The best Bond is undoubtedly Sean Connery who had the presence and \\"X\\" factor only seen in Mafia Godfathers and real life high ranking Spooks (Intelligence Officers). Daniel Craig at 5 feet 11 inches tall is also the shortest actor to play Bond to date. There are also quite a few glaring errors in the movie. For example, MI6 is not the Security Service as seen on the laptop screen, but rather the Secret Intelligence Service or SIS. At the start of the film, Bond half drowns his target in a wash basin in a public toilet, and FAILS to check if his target is really dead which is unprofessional. The target revives to try to kill him but his quick reflexes save his life and he opens fire with one hand. Here is the error, because I presume the Director wanted him to shoot that way to look stylish for artistic reasons. However, anyone who has been trained to handle weapons like pistols and other small arms would never fire with one hand (unless the other hand is badly injured). Professionals use the two hand grip with a Weaver stance. Also in the Embassy shootout in Madagscar, Bond shoots on the run. It is an old FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) maxim to never shoot on the move simply because when you fire from an unstable platform, your chances of hitting the target are very low. He also has a very bad attitude to food and wine and tells the waiter when asked if he wants his Vodka Martini shaken or stirred, \\"Does it look like I care?\\" To be true to Ian Fleming's creation, Bond is always the knowledgeable gourmet and wine connoisseur. My friend, Patrick Glendinning who fought communist terrorists in the jungles of Malaya with the 7th Gurkha Rifles told me once, \\"When we were on leave in Singapore, we stayed in Raffles and lived like KINGS! You see we never knew whether we would be alive or dead the next minute when we were in the jungle.\\" People like Bond who kill or be killed and are in high risk jobs tend to be somewhat hedonistic in nature. The authentic Bond would never say \\"Does it look like I care?\\" or when asked about the lamb, reply \\"Skewered.\\" He would know how the lamb was prepared and what sauce came with it. In addition, when Bond requested for  Champagne from room service, he merely said, \\"Bollinger Grande Annee.\\" Another glaring error. Why? Simply because every Bollinger La Grand Annee has a year of vintage. I know because I am a wine connoisseur and I have visited the Bollinger Champagne Maison in France. This Bond is too emotional. The true Bond is very cold and cool under fire as all professionals in this line of work have to be to stay alive.

B00005JP1C|4.0|It just goes to show that talent is not geographical.<br /><br />Hilary Swank is all class - even if a movie is so-so, she never, EVER is.<br /><br />But all those other 'non-Hollywood' professional actors from Louisiana prove that they hold their own with a 2-time Oscar Winning actress & award-winning director.<br /><br />Musicians, Singers, Artists & Chefs receive deserved national attention and recognition.  It's about time performing artists do too, and this movie proves it.<br /><br />(Even though, admittedly, it's not the best movie to ever come out of Louisiana.)  But it certainly provokes a dialogue about religion, science, faith & fact.  But personally, that doesn't matter either because the movie's production company unwittingly evacuated about 200 Louisiana employees during Hurricane Katrina & committed to finish the movie there.  It cost them much money to do that, I'm sure.  How ironic a movie about the 10 Biblical signs of the plague would be challenged by the biggest natural disaster to hit the exact location of the film?  Which makes it more special & worth owning.
0307346609|5.0|Max Brooks returns with his second zombie related novel, \\"World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War.\\" Whereas his first novel, \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" gave precise instructions on how to prepare for a zombie uprising, this novel is a collection of interviews done by the author (we can only assume it's Brooks himself) with dozens of survivors of the Zombie War, a worldwide global catastrophe that had taken place a few years earlier.   <br /> <br />He starts the novel by documenting the outbreak in China which was covered up by officials at the highest levels of government. Without warning, the plague of flesh hungry undead soon spills into parts of Asia, Europe and is soon transmitted globally. Brooks shows great political insight as he \\"interviews\\" the survivors, each one with their own idea regarding who is to blame regarding the outbreak. Those interviewed include: an elderly Chinese doctor who encounters what they refer to as \\"Patient Zero,\\" the first zombie of the initial outbreak; and a doctor in South America who involuntarily performs a heart transplant with an infected heart and cleans up his own mess. These are just a few of the characters that Brooks introduces us to before the epidemic spreads and the world is in the grasp of the undead in what was called the \\"Great Panic.\\"  <br /> <br />The \\"Great Panic\\" is the section of the book where Brooks details the encounters between the undead and people around the world. Not everybody who fought and died in the Zombie War was a solider as Brooks introduces us to regular people who fought for themselves and their families. He interviews a family who decides to head north to Canada in the hopes that the cold would freeze the undead only to be faced with another problem: starving, desperate humans.  Brooks also introduces the reader to a soldier who fought in the Battle of Yonkers, which was a battle between thousands of undead New Yorkers and US soldiers, who were ultimately defeated and forced to retreat.  This is by far the bleakest section of the novel as it documents the last hope of mankind as the numbers of zombies multiply and hopes of humanity dwindle. <br /> <br />The section titled \\"Turning the Tide\\" documents how people around the world found ways to outsmart and eventually defeat the undead. Brooks interviews a man in South Africa, who gives Brooks insight into what was referred to as the \\"Redeker Plan.\\" This was a strategy that involved soldiers grouping a select group of civilians into makeshift fortresses and essentially using them as bait to lure zombies away from \\"Safe Zones\\" so that soldiers and armed forces could clear any zombies from these zones, regroup, and then begin attacking legions of the undead. The plan, despite it's gruesome idea of using humans as bait, worked and would eventually be used by other nations as a way to start driving hordes out.   <br /> <br />Brooks then moves on, interviewing witnesses and discussing the \\"Total War\\" that mankind had with the undead after they were able to unite and fight against a common enemy.  It's an interesting read as Brooks talks to soldiers in the US services, including a young lady who found herself in zombie infested woods; a Chinese admiral who helped steal a Chinese sub where the crew brought their families and supplies to live at sea for months; and a particularly interesting account of an elderly Japanese man that was blinded at Hiroshima who survived in the wilderness, slaying zombies by the dozens with nothing but his wits and his sword.  <br /> <br />Brooks does a terrific job of detailing so many different types of people and their struggles. He crafts each character wonderfully, giving them their own insight, feelings, and reactions to the rise of the undead. Brooks is able to make them relatable to the reader, such as the case of elderly blind man and a wheelchair bound man who is at first turned down by groups of extermination squads due to his ailment. He also does a tremendous jobof making some characters downright horrid, such as an unethical pharmaceutical executive who made a hefty profit by marketing a bogus pill that would cure anybody of zombie ailments, which only lead to an increase in zombies. <br /> <br />Where Brooks excels at is making the book so realistic and disturbing on a global level. He details government officials who ignore the warnings of their people as well as the fall of governments around the world who denied all signs of the incoming Panic.  He also describes the movement of millions of refugees who escape to neighboring countries, which in turn allows the plague to spread faster and wider.  It's these passages that make the novel gripping as they are incredibly realistic and document a global chaos. While the situation itself is false, one could assume that a world wide panic of this sort would be this scary and horrific. Brooks ends the novel by interviewing those who are aiding in the rebuilding process, including those who hunt down the undead that will soon thaw out after being frozen in higher elevations.  <br /> <br />The book is not without its humorous points such as a soldier who falls in love with the band Iron Maiden after destroying zombies while listening to their CD's. Brooks also parodies himself when one survivor says that a certain survival guide did not help at all and \\"must have been written by an American.\\"  <br /> <br />This is a great and enticing read that I had trouble putting down. Much like his first work, \\"World War Z,\\" is gruesome, gripping, and ultimately an insightful read into the zombie genre.  <br />

About a year ago I read it but i like it so much that decided to write a good review for it.  I highly reccomend this book for the younger people because it includes action, and not just boring facts like some other books.  To Kill A Mocking Bird isn't just for middle aged people, it is good for all ages old enough to read the book.  I think that you, the customer, should read this book.  It  is wonderfully written.  Harper Lee really knows how to properly present a book in its best format.
B00008G9JM|5.0|A Passion Play is , by far , the best album the Tull ever recorded , and would have been the best album I have listened to in my life , had it not been for the Soft machine's \\" Third\\" ( although sometimes I'm still in doubt which one is the best ) .   The complexity of rhythms and textures , the incredible technique of the band's members , the immaginative , yet somehow obscure lyrics , the wittiness and the elegance of the arrangements have indeed no parallel in the \\"rock\\" universe. Closer to Bach than rock , it may appear a bit difficult at first , but is allways rewarding and revealing with repeated listenings. I , at least , have been listening to it , continuously over the past 34 years and still am amazed at the genious of Ian Anderson. I even enjoy the \\"Story of the Hare who lost his spectacles\\" as the orchestration is clever and leans more to the classical side of things .

The songs speak for themselves, \\"Stand Back\\", \\"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\\", \\"Leather & Lace\\", \\"Edge Of Seventeen\\", \\"Silver Springs\\", \\"Rhiannon\\", etc. are all classics (the only hit missing is one of her best songs, the country-rock Top 40 hit \\"After The Glitter Fades\\").

B000021XS0|5.0|This is definately the greatest modern prog-metal album ever released. I bought this album at the wrong time of my life though, and my experience with this album definately reflects the accessibility of Dream Theater's epic masterpiece.<br /><br />I bought this album about five years ago based on an article in a Guitar World issue that acclaimed Dream Theater's 'Metropolis' to be the ultimate heavy guitarist's wet dream. While Petrucci's work here is absolutely his best, there is so many different themes and contrasting focus that I was immediately turned off of this album. Too much to think about I guess. Since then I have become very aquainted with the world of unconventional and challenging music, and therefore in love with 'Metropolis'.<br /><br />What we have here is an epic concept album focusing on the story of a murder...('Operation: Mindcrime' anyone?) that is presented in an amazing whirlwind of mad genius. Every member of 'the Orchestra', as they refer to themselves, are in top notch form, executing a truly breathtaking preformance. This album captivates the true Dream Theater sound, in my opinion. The themes are all over the map in 'Metropolis'. From ragtime to classical to pure shredding metal, Dream Theater are truly are masters of all things musical.<br /><br />'Metropolis' is the ultimate sonic journey. All instrumentation is pitch-perfect, and this album obtains a level of epic grandeur that no other album I have ever heard can possibly match. Dream Theater have never, and will never release anything to top this masterpiece. Written by gods, and preformed by techincal madmen, 'Metropolis' should be the first album that anyone searching for the ultimate musical challenge should purchase. Fair warning should be offered on the other hand, this music will not be appreciated by anyone unprepared to think.
B000BNI90O|3.0|I realy can't add to what others have said about this set, the music is simply the best LOTR soundtrack collection out there! It is all here, and the contents of this set will make any LOTR fan happy and the music DVD is a great one disc addition if you want to hear the entire score in one sitting (to which I have done a number of times already).<br />My only complaint is the somewhat flimsy cardboard box that houses the contents of this musical treasure. Mine came damaged, and considering the price, I expected better packaging. This is a minor quabble on my part and NO, I havent returned it due to the fact that the music itself Is what I truly treasure, It just would have been nicer to have recieved it undamaged.<br /><br />Music-5<br />Packaging-3<br /><br />*for the record I had rated this Item 5 stars not the 3 stars that is showing at the top of my review*
B000AJJNPY|2.0|I know I am joining a dwindling minority when I speak against this band, but I just can't help myself. I own two Sigur Ros albums including this one and I have listened to them many times in attempt to understand why this band has such a sterling reputation, but I have failed to uncover this mystery.<br /><br />It seems like in the writing process, Sigur Ros get in a huddle and say to themselves, 'Lets find the most beautiful sound we can and use it throughout the entire album.' I mean, the sounds this band can make are amazing, but there is absolutely no 'umph' nor meaning to this music as far as I can tell. Its like this band tries to recreate the sound you hear while stepping through heaven's gate, and succeed! But I do not want to remain at heaven's doorstep throughout an entire album. I want a band to take me into heaven and show me how it feels to live amongst the clouds, and walk on solid gold. There is very little variation in all of Sigur Ros works, and very little more than one long, but pretty droning sound. This album is like staring directly into the sun; its bright and overwhelming at first, but after a couple of minutes your eyes get tired of it, and block it out.<br /><br />Personally, when I listen to music I want it to take me places. I want to expirence an aurol journey that lifts me off my feet with passion and energy, and Sigor Ros does not deliver. This band provides nothing more to me than a pleasant background noise. For the record, a little light/dark contrast goes a long way in music, and the same shining noise throughout an entire album is a good start, but gets stale and overdone very quickly. Just think how much brighter the light would be, mixed with a little bit of darkness! Think about how much more interesting the Sigur Ros concept would be with the slightest bit of contrast. Some will argue that there are dynamics throughout this album, and I will agree, but anyone can play music louder to create a cheesy sense of climax. Change is good! No change is boring.<br /><br />To me, Sigur Ros lacks everything I look for in music: Contrast, direction, backbone and passion. If I were you I would check out Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Explosions in the Sky, and Pelican for music with personality.e is boring.     To me, Sigur Ros lacks everything I look for in music: Contrast, direction, backbone and passion.

1594200823|4.0|The best reason to recommend this book is Pollan's entertaining writing.  He takes the relatively mundane yet preachy subject of American food production and turns it into an intriguing journey.  His descriptions of weighing the organic backstory on boxes at Whole Earth Foods or killing chickens at Polyface Farms are strangely inviting and funny.      If you are serious about the subject of organic food, it is a good read.  If you are a little more skeptical or even put off by the organic food crowd, then you will enjoy reading a well-considered look at different ways that your food may reach your plate.  Pollan looks closely at the subject without expecting you to trade-in your dollar menu for couscous.    Kasey Cotulla  [..]  Sacramento
B00065MDSQ|5.0|This is a very focused album from King Crimson. It just seems like with earlier efforts, in too many parts the albums just wander off into a metaphorical desert aimlessly. This album is extremely focused and never becomes too obscure, repetitive or pointless.<br /><br />From the bending chords of the opening track to the very last stop on the rail, 'Red' is a constantly morphing, dissonant, behemoth. The balance of instruments are never overpowering, nor lopsided. Everything flows together so well that without the pause for track changes, you would swear that this is just one long song, with different themes. Plenty of ground is covered on 'Red', from lighter classic rockers that change mysteriously into thoughtful and eerie prog demons, and plenty of instrumental tweaking to keep everything fresh and original.<br /><br />The way that everything seems to work out perfectly in this effort proves that King Crimson are never to be forgotten. Even by modern music standards, 'Red' remains near the top of the list of amazing prog masterpiece albums. Truly immortal this is indeed.
B00078XGRO|5.0|I'm not sure if I'd have ever started watching Star Trek TNG if it wasn't for Patrick Stewart and his amazing performance in this movie.  How they ever got such an amazing actor to jump on board is beyond me but I'm very happy that he did.   <br /> <br />When I watch or read a favorite movie or book, I tend to always skip sections to get to the part that was constantly replaying itself in my head over and over again all day.  In First Contact, I repeatedly jump to Patrick Stewart's \\"Moby Dick\\" scene where he passionately expresses his obsession with destroying the Borg.  It doesn't happen too often when an actor performs exactly how you'd like to express yourself in a way that you never realized might be in you.  I first saw this movie when I was young so it made a distinct impression on me when I saw it.  Been a Trekkie ever since.   <br /> <br />I also thought James Cromwell played Zefram Cochran incredibly.  When he comments on the disparity between him and his future self to Commander Riker, it's just funny how life can turn out and that there is still hope for us all.  Without those two actors, the movie still would have been awesome but it would have just been another good movie but nothing you really had to watch over again.   <br /> <br />So in my opinion, rent it if you must but it's definitely worth the $10.99.  By far the best movie from the TNG series and although I more often than not skip most of the movie to get to my favorite parts, I enjoy them enough to watch the movie in it's entirety once in a while.
B00000K0DQ|5.0|Very good movie.  Great acting & plot.  Very touching.  I am very glad I own this movie.  I will watch it very often.
0140288503|5.0|A historic first hand account about the US prisoner snatch that went horribly wrong. The day is October 4, 1993 and Task force Ranger along with First Special Operations Detachment Delta (Delta Force) is flying into Mogadishu, Somalia. Two Black Hawk Helicopters of the 160th Special Operations Air Regiment (Nightstalkers) are shot down over the city. Then begins the historic rescue of the downed pilots and there crews that eventually lasted through a bloody night leaving 18 Americans killed in action.
074356619X|1.0|I did not read the book I saw the DVD. There was so much hype surrounding this thing someone loaned me a copy of the DVD and insisted I watch it. I did. I was not impressed. It is basically new age thought with a nice, slick package.  <br /> <br />For those that have taken this thing to be a blueprint for success I have a couple of questions. First, how do you define 'positive' thoughts? Seriously, as I heard one 'expert' after another drive home the point of thinking positive thoughts I could not help but ask this question. What if a positive thought to me involves a negative action to you? Who decides which one of us gets the short end of the stick? Oh, that's right, the Universe.  <br /> <br />Second, according to the authors, the main ingredient for success is positive thinking. So what the heck do I go to work for everyday? If thinking 'positive' thoughts will create my successful reality I can tell the boss where to go right? I can just sit at home and visualize a good time, right? And it's going to come to me, right? Wrong.   <br /> <br />In summary, if they want to reject the existence or relevance of God, that's fine (for them). Just do not try to give the now soulless universe godlike judgment capabilities. And from my experience, nothing positive ever came without a whole lot of effort. But then again how does one define positive?  <br />
B000000IS5|5.0|all of the previous reviewers are EXACTLY RIGHT ON TIME! with their ascessments of this truly classic jazz album. one of the all-time great effort. this is the album that i would play when introducing this great art form to someone new to this music. this album was played at the village vanguardin n.y.c. back in the early seventies in between sets. <br />check it out! you will adore it!
0060723513|5.0|This book began my \\"active\\" spiritual journey about 10 years ago. It was the first time I had ever seen my beliefs in writing. I know the lessons learned in this book are not fiction but the way the world actually is. It's beautiful, exciting to read and life impacting. It's also an easy read. I've bought probably 30 copies to give out over the years. Highly recommended.
B0009NCQJ6|5.0|I was introduced to these BOND women through the jaguar magazine.  Their music is explosive and energetic. It is wonderful to listen to for all generations. It is amazing that these 4 women can produce a product that sounds like there were at least 10 more people playing.

B000KCHZK6|3.0|In \\"Not Too Late\\" Norah explores New Orleans and folky stylings, but keeps coming back to her original dreamy sound.  I *loved* her first album to pieces, honestly, and the second one seemed to me like an exploration of folkier sounds. I was hoping she'd regain that fresher feeling she had in the first album that made me and lots of people want to play it over and over.  I have duly added several songs on this album to my \\"Soothing\\" playlist on iTunes, but there's a fine line between producing a seductively soothing line and doing it in your sleep.  I'm still a fan, but hoping for Norah to get better writing, better production, more inspiring life events, or whatever it would take to get her to make a truly outstanding album.
B000O77SOK|5.0|This show was a fine example of successfully mixing torts with the titillating with a good balance that has eluded so many other courtroom dramas over the years. The premise of the show is that Bobby Donnell is the head of a law firm that is barely managing to keep itself financially afloat due to the kinds of cases that the firm takes and the fact that they have trouble collecting their fees from more than a few of their clients. However, these lawyers are the kind of people you would always want on your side. They have a can-do attitude and seem to relish an uphill fight. In fact, at several points in the show, they remind one another that the reason they took on the uncertainty and lesser remuneration of starting their own law firm was so that they could choose their battles rather than work for a big firm where the price of financial safety would be representing big corporate clients, right or wrong. Although this show has a large sexual component, it has several average looking and even outright plain looking folk as regular castmembers. Furthermore, these average looking people, with more than their share of physical flaws, are actually given meaningful personal lives. Creator David E. Kelley actually wrote five of the first six episodes of the first season, and it shows in the performances. Unlike many shows where the characters struggle to figure out who they are, these actors and actresses have their personalities down pat with their opening lines.<br /><br />Since this DVD is recreating season one of \\"The Practice\\" as it was originally planned, we will be missing some of the highlights of season two. First off, the romance between Bobby Donnell and Helen Gamble has a long build-up, a short duration in season two, and a long period of reprisals before the two finally become friends. These episodes will be missing from this installment. Also, Joey Heric, a flamboyent defendant who makes several appearances over the years and is excellently played by John Larroquette, will be missing from this volume. He makes his first appearance in \\"Betrayal\\", which is not on this set. Joey always looks embarrassingly guilty of whatever homicide he happens to be accused and has a \\"I Dare You to Convict Me\\" attitude.<br /><br />If you watched Ally McBeal, another David E. Kelley legal show also based in Boston, you'll probably notice that these two shows are sharing more than a few judges, which only makes sense if you think about it. Removing the seven episodes from volume one, that leaves 21 episodes remaining for the actual season two as it was broadcast. I hope this means future volumes of this show will end on actual season boundaries, since several seasons end with cliffhangers and busting up the seasons any further would rather ruin the continuity of it all.Larroquette, will be missing from this volume.

B00000DG1R|5.0|I  LOVE  THIS  CD.  ALTHOUGH  IM  ONLY  21  I  THINK  DURAN  DURAN  IS  ONE  OF  THE  MOST  COOLEST  BANDS.  THIS  HOLE  CD  IS  UPBEAT,  AND  IT  BRINGS  BACK  MEMORIES   OF  THE  80'S.  MY  FAVORITE  SONG  ON  THIS  CD  IS  COME  UNDONE.  THERES  JUST  SOMETHING  ABOUT  THIS  SONG  THAT'S  CATCHY  AND  THE  VIDEO  IS  EVEN  BETTER.  I  DEFINITLEY  RECOMMEND  THIS  CD.
B000MGUZMU|5.0|A lot has been made of the fact that, since \\"Funeral\\" was such an impressive debut that feels deeply personal to many listeners, following it up would be almost impossible. <br /> <br />\\"Neon Bible\\" is a better record that \\"Funeral\\". It's more complex and mature, so much so that it's almost not fair to compare the two. Play them consecutively and \\"Funeral\\" suddenly feels flimsy and amateurish, even though you would never have thought that before hearing \\"Neon Bible\\". Its dense, lush arrangements reverberate through a spooky recording space, enhancing the feeling of blackness, of a great black wave on a starless night in the middle of the sea, engulfing you. Complete disappearance, without a trace, without a whimper. <br /> <br />So on that level, \\"Neon Bible\\" succeeds brilliantly. The problem is, it inevitably fails on that other level: winning over listeners for whom \\"Funeral\\" is deeply personal, whereas \\"Neon Bible\\" is just some songs by the same band, and none of them \\"Wake Up\\". <br /> <br />Even though the new record offers up tracks like \\"Intervention\\", which is certainly worthy of as many painfully beautiful listens as \\"Wake Up\\", it seems that many people feel almost insulted by the inclusion of \\"(Antichrist Television Blues)\\", a fairly straightforward number that wears its Bruce Springsteen influence on its sleeve. (Never mind that it's a pretty great track.) I suppose the generations born since \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" and \\"Nebraska\\" came out (of which I'm a part) have never really been able to embrace the Boss. This is a great shame. <br /> <br />Also, listeners might be sad to see Renée's singing take more of a \\"back seat\\" (no pun intended) to Win's lead vocals. The only track she does lead vocal duty on is \\"Black Wave/ Bad Vibrations\\", and even then only does the first half, and even THEN it's discordant and off-kilter, certainly miles away from \\"Haiti\\" and \\"In the Backseat\\". But make no mistake: that is a great track and a highly rewarding listen.And her backup vocals throughout the rest of the album are essential to the eerie backbone of the whole record. <br /> <br />I hate to go on too much, but I should just mention that \\"Neon Bible\\" is about 75% danceable, whereas \\"Funeral\\" is 50% at best. If you're a white-guy, head-nodding, super-boring type, that might not be impressive, but for me, if music has the power to make you move yourself without sacrificing any of its beauty, that is a big plus. <br /> <br />So to those of the Arcade Fire backlash: give it a fair shot. And stop hating on the Boss.
1582701709|4.0|Here is where the men and boys get separated.  The boys will either accept everything The Secret says as though it were the ultimate gospel or they will reject it out of hand as a collection of utter nonsense.  It is neither.  This \\"secret\\" is the worst kept secret in the universe.  Obviously, if you approach anything with a closed mind and a negative attitude the outcome will be less than desirable.  On the other hand, we all know that whatever we approach with an open mind and a positive attitude turns out better.  All of that is essentially trite.  We all already know it; but for some reason we need to be constantly reminded to pay attention to our attitudes.  I also know from repeated personal experience (and had identified this experience long before I acquired this book) that if we focus on anything with intensity we do indeed invite it to us.  I am not certain whether I believe that our thoughts have consequences or not, but I do know that our attitudes have consequences.  And that is all that The Secret has to say.  You can throw it all out in the trash if you so desire, you can put it in a shrine and worship it or you can take it with care, balance, rationality, and discretion and benefit from the experience.
B000NA1OXY|3.0|To begin with, I'm a huge fan of Avril's and there's probably only one or two songs of hers that I dislike so I haev BIG expectations for this album.  <br /> <br />I haven't heard the full album but I've heard about 6 songs (not exactly sure which ones) through her TV special and on the net. <br /> <br />I REALLY like \\"All You Will Ever Know\\". My favorite of her new songs I've heard. <br /> <br />Also, \\"Not the Only One\\" is pretty good. The more I listen to it, the better it gets. It's got sort of a Jack Johnson-ish sound to it in some parts. <br /> <br />I'm not a big fan of \\"Girlfriend\\". I find it sort of obnoxious and more like something that should have been on her first album when she was in her teens. She also has a couple songs that are somewhat similar to that, and that disappointed me since I was expecting a more grown-up album.   <br /> <br />\\"You Never Satisfy Me\\" is okay, but not great. Maybe after listening to it a couple times I'll like it more.   <br /> <br /> <br />So, so far I've heard 6 songs. Three of which I was disappointed in because I was expecting more mature tracks. Two of which I really like, and one of which I'm pretty indifferent to.  <br /> <br />I'll still get the album but I'm hoping that I just got unlucky with the songs I've heard and that the rest of her album.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|I, like everybody else who heard the news of another Rocky film, shook my head and said \\"what's left to say?\\"  Well, the early reviews came out and Sylvester Stallone did the expected promotional interviews.  What I heard wetted my appetite.  Stallone was not my favorite actor but when I saw him in a film I liked him.  After renting this film the first comment I made to my wife was, \\"this is one of the most underrated actors in the history of Hollywood!\\"  In this, the last of the series, we see for the first time an introspective and truly pained man in conflict with his past, his present and his future.  Sylvester Stallone has crafted a real story, although stretching credibility at times, but revealing the inner thoughts and emotions of a plain average Joe.  Stallone IS Rocky Balboa!  Unlike several of the in between Rockys this one is, in my mind, the best of the series.  You needn't have seen the first five to appreciate and understand this film.  The acting throughout is first rate, the production values are great, the fighting choreography is superb and for once, he has a believable ring foe in Mason Dixon, unlike the Dolf Lundgrens and Mr. T's of the past. <br /> <br />Critics will continue to minimize the abilities and appeal of Sylvester Stallone but I put him in the same league as John Wayne who, depite every adversity that befell him, whether in World War II combat, fighting gunslingers in the old West or courting an Irish maiden in old Erin, never lost his moral compass and ultimately prevailed.  I would definitely nominate ROCKY BALBOA as one of the best films of 2007.
B000002TQV|5.0|This was a ROCK album before it was an alternative piece. I absolutly love the jangly guitars, the hard drum beats, and the many degrees of Thom Yorke's voice. Fake Plastic Trees is as good as social commentary gets, and Just, The Bends, and High N' Dry are instant rock classics. The videos they made in the period are also spectacular. The one for Fake Plastic Trees is cool, full of colorful imagery. The video for Just is my favorite video of all time. It simply is just cool as hell. Check them out if you can find them!
B00004RJ71|4.0|I think what seperates this movie from other prison movies is there's a much bigger message to be learned, and it's not just stay away from prison (we all know that by now). However, there's more to it, and this movie shows you that. Don't get me wrong, you still have the same violent, death by shankings, and rioting scenes, but that's just not the primary focus of the whole movie. Let me just say that I am glad that it wasn't as violent and graphic in nature with the rape scenes as it's fellow Chicano prison film.. American Me. American Me was good, but it's so dark throughout. There were no happy moments in that movie from start to finish. Frankly, after watching that I went from calm and cool to sick and depressed. However, with Blood in Blood Out, this was the first time they tried to actually give you a happy ending. This movie is about much more than drugs and prison rape scenes. It's about family, loyalty, coming of age, and finding forgiveness. The man that Paco started out as, is not who he grew up to be, which was inspirational in a way. It just shows that just because your life starts off bad that doesn't always mean that you can't change who you are, and become something more than just a common street thug. This movie shows you that family is family, and no matter what your family does it's never too late to forgive them and start over. However, I do have 2 pet peeves about this movie. First of all, in my opinion, the movie was entirely too long. Secondly, Miklo didn't learn a damn thing. It's sad that even though he lost a limb he never changed his mentality or his ways, and he ultimately ended up the way he started out. There was no growth with his character period. At least the 2 brothers finally grew up, and became the men they were suppose to be. I guess that just goes to show that some people get it, and some people don't. Overall, I don't think this movie was perfect, but if you give it a chance it is pretty good. Certainly, better than what I wasexpecting to begin with.
B000002B2T|5.0|This is a mellow, artsy kind of album, but man does it RULE. I love Layne's range. He does Facelift, Dirt, and the Self-Titled while releasing the acoustic CD's in between (SAP and Jar o' Flies). The guy was just a musical genius. This record show that. Having the super backing band also helped, with vocals from Screaming Tree's Mark Lanegan (THE single most UNDERRATED vocailist to ever emerge from Seattle) and Mike from Pearl Jam's excellent 70's style guitar is the icing on the cake. River of Deciet, Lifeless Dead, I don't know anything, and Im alone are my fav's. There isnt a bad track on this CD.

B00004XOWM|5.0|Especially now that nu-metal is dead and korn and linkin park are the only thriving nu-metal bands it is embarrasing to admit to liking a limp bizkit album. I am not a huge limp bizkit fan, but this album is definately worth listening too. Every song on this album is entertaining if you are a hard rock fan. This album is definately a good album to get the adrenaline going. Even if you are embarrased to have anyone know that you are listening to limp bizkit it is definately worth listening to in secret.
B000K7VHJQ|5.0|This is one of those movies that can't be seen enough.  It reminds us of the true meaning of Easter.  I especially appreciate the scene where Jesus is praying in the Garden of Gesthemane and he is being hassled by Satan.  Then, a snake crawls to where Jesus is kneeling and he then stands up, looks Satan in the eye and crushes the head of the snake.  It makes you want to stand up and cheer!
B000IHY9SE|3.0|This album is an average rap album. It has moderate beats and lyrics. There is also a reasonable amount of filler. \\"You Don't Know\\" is a decent club banger and \\"No Apologies\\" gives us a glimpse and a reminder of the old eminem before his encore album.

0743289684|5.0|Is Islam truly a religion of peace and love?  Would it be possible to gather around the negotiating table and reason our way out of the Iraq situation and talk the Iranians into putting aside their nuclear ambitions?  Read Infidel and you will find the answers.  How can we ever find common ground with people who have, since birth, been taught that Americans and Jews are Satan? Either convert us to Islam, or kill us - that's the choice.<br /><br />I have admiration and respect for Ali - and what she endured to find a better life - and I fear for her safety.  I was deeply affected by her metamorphosis from total submission to her beliefs to her courage to question them.  She takes us with her as she reaches for truth.  We feel her pain as each bit of enlightenment means that to embrace it and move forward, she must leave loved ones behind.<br /><br />I did not understand the life of the Muslim woman until I read this book.  It is difficult for us, with all of the freedoms we take for granted, to understand how anyone could willingly live in such subjugation.  It is all they have ever known or been taught.  And it has been taught as part of their religion.  How on earth can we expect to be greeted as the great liberators or even as friends, when they take one look at us and see Satan?<br /><br />This book is more than just one woman's story.  It is a window into the soul of Islam - not from some lofty, isolated perch - but from the streets she walked, the schools where she learned from the Koran, the mosques where she prayed, and the arms of those who nurtured her.<br /><br />You will read this book like a novel - you won't be able to put it down. And you'll think about it every time the news comes on and some seeker of fame puts forth his solution for a quick fix to the problems of the Middle East.
B00003CXCD|5.0|What more can be said about this film? Filmed on location in Rome, Italy in the fifties.  Greg Peck and Audrey Hep.  Nuff said!
B0002MRPDQ|5.0|Hugo Montenegro be gone!  If you have heard any of this Ennio Morricone music in other formats by other artists, you owe it to yourself to hear the original vision for this music.  You can almost see the movie without watching it, as you listen to this atmospheric, haunting soundtrack.  While most people associate this soundtrack solely with either the main title theme or Ecstasy of the Gold, there is much more here worth repeated listening and appreciation.  Highly recommended.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|When I first heard Stevie Nicks would be releasing yet another \\"Greatest Hits\\" type package, I wasn't thrilled. She released Timespace in 1991 and the Enchanted Box Set in 1998.<br /><br />However this set, while not as comprehensive as Enchanted, but way more than Timespace--is the ultimate set, especially for the casual Nicks fan. Enchanted usually sells for around $40, being a 3-disc set, with this CD + DVD is going for around $20, it is a much more affordable package.<br /><br />The only TRUE Fleetwood Mac track is \\"Silver Springs,\\" the other Fleetwood Mac tracks are performed live by Stevie on solo tours (Rhiannon and Landslide), and \\"Dreams\\" is a Deep Dish dance remix with new vocals recorded by Stevie in 2005. It was an interesting and effective way to put a few Mac tunes on Crystal Visions. Some may wonder why not all solo work? Well most people associated Stevie Nicks with Fleetwood Mac AND her solo work. It makes the set more comprehensive.<br /><br />The live tracks are masterfully recorded in perfect quality. Landslide and Edge of Seventeen sound magical with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, recorded in 2006 live. Stevie's rockin' live cover of Led Zeppelin's \\"Rock N Roll\\" is also an added gem. It has become a staple in Stevie's concert set list since the Summer of 2005, and definitely was added to appeal to Stevie's more \\"hardcore\\" fan base.<br /><br />Purchase the CD/DVD set is a much more value conscious purchase than purchasing Crystal Visions as a CD only. The DVD features all of Stevie's music videos, except 1998's \\"If You Ever Did Believe\\" video, a song from the movie \\"Practical Magic.\\" Viewers have the option of watching the music videos by themselves, or with added commentary by Stevie Nicks. It feels like Stevie Nicks is sitting next to you on your couch when watching the videos, from start to finish, with the voice over commentary. Instead of the same comments we've all heard before, Stevie offers tons of insight into the making of each video. Highlights of the DVD include the \\"Stand Back - Scarlett Version\\" which Stevie humorously pokes fun at herself throughout the video. She adds during the \\"Stop Draggin My Heart Around\\" video with Tom Petty that her lip singing was NOT at it's best in her first video.<br /><br />The set is recommended to any Stevie Nicks fan. It also proves that Stevie has not let go of the album form. She included written background stories to each song (Except \\"Rooms on Fire,\\" and I'm not sure why) in the booklet of the CD, and tons of beautiful Stevie Nicks photos.<br /><br />Finally Stevie fans have a \\"Best Of..\\" set to be proud of!
B000NDIAWO|4.0|Normally, I am against buy re-releases. Usually, all we get are 2-4 new songs or a bonus dvd. For example, Usher's \\"Confessions\\" was a crappy re-release with only 4 extra songs. I have to make an exception with this re-release of \\"B'day\\" (I've been meaning to buy it on cd anyways since my original copy is a gift on Vinyl LP Record). With it's 11 new songs, this re-release is practically a whole new album. My only problem with this re-release is that \\"Back Up\\" (which was on the original release at Circuit City stores) is not on it.
0515127485|4.0|Good page turning novel, gripping mystery interspersed with historical fact and melded with some speculative fiction.  Much like his first novel, Fatherland, the author is entirely literate on World War II era history.  Fatherland speculates on German society had Hitler won, whereas Archangel speculates if Stalin had an heir.<br /><br />Fluke Kelso is a downtrodden Russian history specialist ostracized for his unconventional views on Russian & Soviet history.  While in modern Russia Fluke meets an old NKVD guard with intimate knowledge of Stalin's black oil skin notebook containing an explosive secret.  For four days we follow Fluke along with an American reporter as they try to recover this notebook and unlock the secret.<br /><br />Harris demonstrates the mixed feelings modern day Russians feel toward Stalin's reign of terror.  Much of the country still embraces Communism and venerates the dictator to this day.  The contrast between Stalin's era and the modern day Russia is an integral part of the story as Russia struggles to adapt to globalization and capitalism.
B000060OFT|5.0|I adore this movie. I don't know what else to say about it other than that. The acting was awesome, Shakespeare is wonderful, and I cry every time.
B00005JPGO|5.0|This is a good film and that Zwick's gamble paid off at the end brings me not little pleasure. The film, mainly shot in South Africa (we see some exquisite East Coast landscapes) and Mozambiquan towns, took a tremendous effort to make, both logistically and politically.  Finally the Western audiences can see what represents daily life for many Africans.<br /><br />Far for being simply PC, this film shows that Hollywwod can sometimes be genuinely concerned about the root causes of human suffering. The wars that ravaged Sierra Leone and Liberia (spreading into other neighboring countries, such as Guinea) are depicted realistically. The violent scenes were, if anything, less graphic than reality on the ground. Child soldiers intoxicated by rap, drugs and alcohol and the 'grown-up' militaries led by the likes of Samuel Doe, Charles Taylor and the RUF committed unspeakable brutalities. Can we, should we, judge them? The film depicts the indoctrination these children underwent and underscores the fact that the responsibility and real guilt for this suffering lies with the diamond traders that control the supply/demand chain. Traders, who by and large lead respectable lives in Antwerp, London, Tel Aviv and Cape Town.<br /><br />Without any doubt West African atrocities are/were fueled by demand created by artificial inflation of diamond's worth. With resepct to the suffering caused to Africans, the diamond merchants of today are not much better from slave traders of the recent past - a few centuries ago similar atrocities were fueled through slave trade flourishing in the same region ('the Gold Coast', 'the Slave Coast').<br /><br />The main character played by DiCaprio is a Rhodesian, an ex member of the 32nd SA battalion and the Rhodesian army. Rhodesian mercenary and counter-insurgency units were (and still are) legend material - famous around the world as perhaps some of the best trackers and fighters in history. These people also showed that fighting together is the easiest ticket to multiracial integration - as we an see today in Iraq.<br /><br />DiCaprio was, for me, a great surprise. Impeccable acting; the accent, the nervous ticks and mannerisms, the naturalness all suggest he's  grown a formidable presence. The acting suggested a combination of intelligence and fierceness, an announcement of a new force on the acting scene. Connelly was consistently good. Hounsou's performance was mixed - from generic and not credible to heroic and deeply moving. Finally, the music was excellent.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent film that exposes what has been going on in West Africa in the past decade or two. It is perhaps too much to hope that suckers living in 'civilized' countries will stop imbuing simple rocks with magical and romantic aura, enriching cynical diamond merchants and perpetuating the vicious cycle. Do you think you really show love for your woman by allowing De Beer to make a few hundred/thousands of dollars off of your paycheck (and naivete)? It is time to stop this anachronistic custom that is but a simulacrum for true love and commitment, or wealth. This movie is a step in the right direction.iracial integration - as we an see today in Iraq.     DiCaprio was, for me, a great surprise.

0374105235|5.0|This memoir, written by one who lived it, is a tribute to the spirit of a youth, overcome with a terrible war and forced to do things he would never have thought of doing, finally rescued and then faced with the long journey back to the man he was meant to be.   <br />   This kind of warfare, using children and teaching them to be, not warriors, but modern-day barbarians, is not limited to any one country in Africa, but is as wide-spread as is civil war in that dark continent. <br />   Were it not for the courageous men and women of UNICEF many of these young men would never be rescued and rehabilitated to live in our world as honorable citizens. <br />I really liked this book.  It was well-written and told of the plight of having had a loving family and losing it completely.  Going into a world you never knew at the age of 12 and surviving to use your voice to tell your story is a remarkable accomplishment.  Those who care about children will enjoy this story written by one who lived it.
0618680004|4.0|Dawkins is a great explainer of the workings of biological evolution. I have read some of his past works and found them illuminating and informative. In this book, however, he enters the \\"culture war\\" full force, and to this former admirer, he falls off his pedestal. An unabashed atheist, he bashes just about everyone except other atheistic scientists. He loses me when he refers to fundamentalist Christians in the U.S. as the American Taliban. This only deepens the divide and serves no purpose. Even agnostics such as myself do not escape his wrath.  <br />Nevertheless, the book is illuminating and worthwhile for those who wish to get some perspective on the role of faith and religion from the atheist viewpoint. You don't have to like him, but he is always a worthwhile read.
B000ASDFJU|3.0|I purchased this box set for my girlfriend and had problems with several DVD's in the series.  I recieved replacement items from Amazon that were also defective (shows didn't play or stopped in mid-stream).  I even checked my local retailer and had the same defects there too.  Amazon did offer a refund of the complete series.  However, we just accepted the defects and kept our original set.  It's that good.  In addidtion, HBO customer service offered some contact info to address this problem, seems several people have had similar problems with this batch of dvd's.  I haven't heard back from HBO yet.

B000063DIR|1.0|DIARY OF A MADMAN and BLIZZARD OF OZZ were once on the list of greatest rock recordings of all time; now they're universally panned. Now they're Diary of A Sadman and Blizzard of Idiots. Good move. Think about it; John Michael (I think he's lost the right to use the name Ozzy for now) doesn't know how to play a stinking kazoo, much less bass and drums, yet he doesn't want to pay the men who wrote and performed the bass and drum parts on those albums; no he wants to take all that money home for himself. He doesn't give a damn what the \\"fans\\" want; you have been cut out of the loop. Oh, and lets don't forget to give the lovely Sharon her due credit. Wake up folks, his name is John Michael Osbourne and he has NEVER been the person he pretends to be on stage. \\"Ozzy\\" is a fantasy personality adopted by a lost and lonely little boy, when an astute manager/CEO in the making(Sharon) showed up to \\"save\\" him. He wrote great lyrics from the mindset of an impotent teenager, who can't deal with reality in any other way than through fantasy, but he was 32 years old when he recorded DIARY. Those great lyrics might continue to attract upcoming teenagers, but I think they have people closer to their own age to do that and aren't gonna be depending on an antiquated recording by a 60 year old fart to help them cope. No, what John Michael just did, was disconnect himself from a hardcore fanbase of other middle-age farts who had a shining memory of how heavy metal saved their teenage souls, and he just shattered that little memory. It's hard to reminisce of the old days, when the soundtrack to your memory changes. Anyone who's seen even one episode of \\"The Osbournes\\" should quickly realise the whole \\"Ozzy\\" personality is a put on. So don't be surprised when he turns his back on his former bandmates and fans for money. JohnMichaelFest just doesn't have the same ring does it? Lame.
B0007PAMR4|2.0|I love David Lynch, but he wasn't the right guy for this.  Or else he should have been given the same budget as Lord of the Rings and allowed to make three movies out of it, and not until 2006.  <br /> <br />For someone who has read the book, it's just adding someone else's pictures, that were possibly cool at the time.  Now it's just B-movie sci-fi effects with characters mouthing (and I do mean mouthing) the dialog from the book.   <br /> <br />Dune is a complex, very sophisticated, interwoven high-concept story.  Words in the novel and its sequels are generally densely packed with crafty meaning, which ultimately reveal mind-altering surprises that combine ecology, religion, politics, history, and warfare at a genius level of insight.  None of that comes through in the movie.  It apparently assumes you've read the book and are coming for the special effects and good-looking actors.   <br /> <br />Now, I realize this is harsh.  No one ever sets out to make a stinker of a movie.   <br /> <br />The fact is it just isn't Lynch's material (original or \\"adopted\\").  I believe it's the first and the last time he took a director-for-hire job. He hired a bunch of actors that would one day be perfect for Twin Peaks, but absurd here.  Come on!  I laughed out loud when Everett \\"Hank\\" McGill was revealed to be Stilgar.  Hank the milquetoast gas station owner?!  And he was a great Hank, but he's playing Stilgar in the same character, so it becomes comedy! <br /> <br />Anyway, Dune is such a stunning, classic piece of literature.  It's too bad no one has ever (I'm including the TV versions) done it justice.  Lord of the Rings has showed us that adaptation of long, great works can be done right, and how to do it.  I only hope someone, someday will feel that doing the same with Dune will be viable.  <br /> <br />
B00079FUI6|5.0|I didn't think I would like this show since it seemed like a show only geared towards a women audience. I was mistaken. After watching a couple of episodes, I was hooked.  The writing on the show is pretty funny.  The different plots on the show are interesting and quite entertaining. The acting is top-notch and very believable.  I think anyone would enjoy this show.     Peace and Happiness,    Patrick Leonardi

B000GB775E|4.0|This one is a fable. JUST MY LUCK is a sweet and funny love story about a mismatched pair, Ashley and Jake. Ashley (Lindsay Lohan) has always been touched by fabulous luck, while ill fate seems to persistently hang over Jake (Chris Pine). One fateful night, at a masquerade party while wearing masks, they kiss and, somehow, their respective lucks flip flop. Now, with the world suddenly crapping on her, Ashley must find Jake in the Manhattan jungle and reclaim her good fortune before she again gets fired, arrested, or electrocuted, among other things. But, as it turns out, maybe meeting Jake wasn't that unlucky of a thing...<br /><br />As I've said, this one's a fable. My advice for someone who hasn't yet seen JUST MY LUCK?  Just sit back and go with the premise. Outrageous luck and even karma are integral to the plot, but don't overanalyze all the wacky events. JUST MY LUCK is a breezy romantic comedy which modestly tries to please its audience. It also showcases the British pop rock band McFly, whose band members cheerfully play themselves.<br /><br />I enjoyed the acting here. Lindsay Lohan is again reliably engaging as, this time, she navigates the role of a glam girl turned very, very unfortunate soul. Lohan and Pine seem to match up well and show very good chemistry together; I found myself quite actively rooting for their happy ending. Chris Pine I had never seen in anything before, but he proves to be sweet and likable in his performance, with his klutzy side naturally engendering the most sympathy. Lohan continues to build on her promising career as, here, she displays equal measures of charm and pathos. She's very effective during her moments of bleakness, unveiling a touching vulnerability, which is never more endearing than when she at last calmly succumbs to a life of seemingly bad luck. I like the fact that she isn't afraid to look silly  as she has several scenes wherein she careens into mud, commits pratfalls, or stumbles about in a broken heel as her ruined mascara gives her that raccoon look. Honestly, Lindsay Lohan is right up there with the young, up-and-coming actresses who can legitimately act. No, sit down, Tara Reid.<br /><br />There are some funny gags in here as both the leads take their turns getting the bejesus kicked out of them by Lady Luck, including a gross out moment with Jake picking up some tainted cash from the trash. No, the storyline isn't as complicated in plot or as witty as some of Lohan's other works. What it has, though, is an undeniable sweetness and a certain good humored buoyancy which carries the viewer along until the happily ever after. This one rates three and a half lucky stars.ruined mascara gives her that raccoon look. Honestly, Lindsay Lohan is right up there with the young, up-and-coming actresses who can legitimately act.

This performance is something to be proud of and he really did the story justice.
0316381357|4.0|I first read this in high school. It's very well written, diving into the life of a young nurse and doctor's daughter who strives to become the \\"perfect\\" nun Sister Luke. The time in the Belgian Congo suffers the most from the focus on the confines of the nun's life; there is much about the political and cultural background that is ignored or avoided in the depiction of the good \\"black boys\\" who learn to change dressings and the \\"savage monkeys\\" whose souls the nuns desire to convert. Back in Belgium we see Sister Luke conflicted as WWII begins - she wants to take sides, but the nuns are ordered to be nonpartisan. In high school I missed the irony between the unthinking loyalty to Belgium and its policies that the nuns show in the Congo and the loyalty to the resistance which prompts Sister Luke to leave the convent...<br /><br />Others have written on the strictures of the convent that are unreal in their discipline - I think that exaggerations externalize what is normally an internal formation.  For example, letting go of a higher rung on the class structure and having no control over what you eat are hard things to show in a novel - but the image of an accomplished, educated medical professional kneeling to accept soup from the bowls of other nuns makes a huge impression.
B000MTPANQ|4.0|First, let me say the CD/audio of this Neil Young concert from 1971 is fantastic.  The songs he performs in this show are the ones that originally turned me into a big Neil Young fan back in my high school days.  There are the Neil Yong acoustic guitar classics such as \\"Old Man\\", \\"Don't Let It Bring You Down\\", \\"Cowgirl In The Sand\\", \\"Ohio\\", \\"Helpless\\", \\"On The Way Home\\" and \\"Tell Me Why\\" among others which sound outstanding.  There is also that rare gem of a previously unreleased song \\"Bad Fog Of Loneliness\\" which I find to be the most interesting song on the CD. His piano songs also fit very nicely into the mix of songs presented in this show. Neil's banter between songs demonstrates his humor and helps to put you in the audience.  I can't express how good the CD version of this concert is. <br /> <br />The DVD is another story.  Those who are diehard Neil Young fans have probably seen the film footage used to represent this concert in the DVD as being taken from a Dutch documentary of Neil performing in Stratford Conn. about a week after the Massey Hall show in Toronto.  The DVD footage is identical to clips that have appeared on the bootleg market of the Stratford show.  Interesting enough, the songs without a film performance on the DVD (Helpless, Bad Fog Of Loneliness, I Am A Child) were songs not played in Stratford and therefore no film version exists that would enable those performances to appear on the DVD. Also none of the banter between songs is shown in visual form on the DVD either.  There are several other inconsistencies with the DVD that lend credence to the fact that the footage is not from the actual Massey Hall show. One instance is when Neil is speaking to the crowd in the middle of his performance of \\"Dance,Dance,Dance\\". About half way through the song he tells the crowd to \\"make some noise\\" while the camera shows his face while strumming the chords but yet he cannot be seen speaking/mouthing the words on the film.  There are other similar instances throughout the DVD. <br /> <br />The film footage is interesting and a must see for any Neil fan but it is not the actual concert film.  I liken it to a hypothetical purchasing of a similar CD/DVD collection of, lets say for example, \\"The Beatles At Candlestick Park 1966\\" with the audio of the Candlestick Park show used over film footage of the Beatles performing in Cincinnati on the DVD.  All Beatle fans know that would not be acceptable.  I write this to make people aware that you are not getting the actual footage of Massey Hall and there is no mention that the film is from the Stratford concert.  While this takes nothing away from the actual CD performance it does bother me a bit to get something like this from Neil who is pretty honest and upfront about things.  It is a bit misleding IMO. <br /> <br />

The love of the two main charecters seemed a bit rushed ,it should have been developed a bit more. The magician, Norton, really had some great illusions and tricks, the orange tree was incredible. Towards the end you begin to find out that he is not supernatural, but a genius at the top of his game. I thought the twist in the end was a bit telegraphed. Overall I gave this movie 4 out of 5 stars it was an enjoyable 2 hours.
0385340559|5.0|\\"You do not mess with the special investigators\\".<br /><br />No indeed you do not.  This was the motto shared by Reacher's old military police unit.  And in this latest Jack Reacher installment by author, Lee Child, someone has indeed done some messing.  If you are familiar with the Reacher series, then you will understand from the get go that 'bad luck and trouble' are about to be visited upon the bad guys in ways both brutal and inventive.  This becomes trouble with a capital \\"T\\" when one of the baddies trashes Reacher's hotel room AND SMASHES HIS TOOTHBRUSH.  Up until this book, Reacher's personal possessions have amounted only to the clothes on his back and his trusty folding toothbrush.  But 9/11 has finally caught up with Reacher and he now carries a passport and an ATM card also.<br /><br />\\"Bad Luck and Trouble\\" finds Reacher in Portland, Oregon minding his own business.  He is broke after hooking up for a few days with an assistant DA called Samantha.  (This may or may not be Samantha Kincaid, the main character from Alafair Burke's nascent series.  If so, nice referencing here Lee).  On checking his bank account Reacher discovers an unexpected credit in the amount of 1030.00.  Given his preternatural ability with numbers, he swiftly decodes this as a message.  To be precise, a 10-30 which is a military police radio code requesting urgent assistance from a colleague.  From this point Child gives us all the action expected from a Reacher book, with plenty of knotty logistical problems thrown in.  And plenty of bodies being ditched out of helicopters also.<br /><br />The decision is made to pull the old unit back together, and the initial response rate is ominously low.  Some of Reacher's colleagues are MIA in the very recent past and at least one has experienced death from a high altitude.  There is much talk of vengeance and 'watering' the graves of the perpetrators.  We have revisited Reacher at work in his previous career in one other of Lee Child's books \\"The Echo\\", and this is a different angle again.  Reacher and his remaining colleagues go to work like the Justice League of America tracking their missing buddies and those responsible.<br /><br />\\"Bad Luck and Trouble\\" is a cracker.  I knocked it off in a day and it lived up to all my expectations (which are very high) of Lee Child's writing.  He even has Reacher doing a tiny bit of soul searching, especially when he compares himself to the post military careers of his old unit.  I doubt this will ever evolve into an investment portfolio and a house in the 'burbs or a high paying gig in a private security firm, but it works to humanise the 'Jack Reacher, alone, ever walking the earth' thing, giving a bit more dimension to his character.<br /><br />I'm personally grateful to Lee for dropping the \\"Jack Reacher/Men want to be him/women want to be with him\\" slogan found on the blurbs of his other Reacher books too.  I'm a woman and this put me off!  For those interested, Reacher even folds a bit over a sartorial choice he made in his own inimitable style, and has also adopted a shaven head for this outing.<br /><br />So whats up next Lee?  Every Reacher book I read I wonder how Child is going to top it with the next one.  I haven't been disappointed yet.  This is a top notch series and its not necessary to read them in order.  Reacher is a man we all love to read about, his appeal is universal.

B000MTPANQ|5.0|Admit it.  How many of us wanted Neil to stay exactly as he was right then and there?  Actually from the very first sliding power of \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" straight through to the peaceful piano and steel guitar tapestry of \\"Words (Between the Lines of Age)\\", he was exactly what we wanted from him.  Then came \\"Time Fades Away\\" and things just kept changing.  Never to be seen or heard the same way again.  Not a bad thing, just very different.  But in January 1971, there he was in his solo, acoustic pre-Harvest loneliness, delivering what most of us viewed as his purity.  Hell, we even learned to play guitar through these songs.  This tour has been available via scratchy bootlegs for years.  It's amazing to hear it with this level of clarity.  It's interesting that he hadn't picked up the harmonica yet.  That was to come in sublime beauty a short time later.  This record is essential.
1892005034|5.0|I was first introduced to this method through Church of Religous Science. When It was first explained to a group of us it sounded wonderful! It sounded like exactly waht I had been looking for. I had been seeking solutions to better communicate with people and to also learn to listen better. My relationship needed to move in a new direction and I was willing to open my heart to the love that I new was dieing to spill out from me. My purpose has always been to motivate and inspire people to be more then they could ever imagine themselves to be and to know they are already that. But I did not know how to communicate to those who were still living from the programming of their painful lifes experiences. I realized through the process how I myself allowed old habits and feelings of the past to filter up when someone did not communicate to me properly. I then would feel that aching, painful anger coming up to respond in the way I had been taught. Marshalls book has been a wonderful tool to change the habits of the past and to truely have all of our needs met through love and respect. I hope that those who are seeking to truely find peace and happiness dig deep into these principles. They really work.

B000JJRIN4|3.0|Not the greatest, but not so bad. Gwen Stefani's newest album is okay.  Her first couple of songs gets the feet dancing but the last songs goes downhill. I'm getting used to one of her songs called yummy with the neptune's front man Pharrell. Album is truly different from the first one.  I really enjoyed her first album better.

B00005MP58|5.0|I had read several of Jane Austen's novels years before I saw this movie, and I didn't get what was so great about them.  But then I saw this movie, and I thought, \\"Oh.  I get it now.\\"  But then, I thought, \\"Oh, probably they have changed it horribly from the book, because I don't remember the book being anything like this great.\\"  So I reread the book, and come to find out, the movie stayed extremely close to the book.  A lot of the dialogue even comes straight from the pages of Jane Austen.  I have seen several other movies based on Pride and Prejudice, but none of them come so close to the book as this one does, and none of them are nearly as great as this one is.  It's long, but to stay so close to the book, it needs to be this long, otherwise you wouldn't have a lot of the buildup to the final climax, and you would be left wondering why the characters chose to do what they did.  Another great thing about this movie, is that, unlike other movies based on classic books, this one is clean enough to watch with the whole family.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|There's a few reviews saying how unreal, out of touch and in a bubble this movie is.  This is one of the only movie I've ever left the theater thinking \\"God, that looked a lot like my life\\".  The situations are hazy, the sex an emotionally distraught blur, the dialog sometimes uncomfortable... just like life.   <br /> <br />To be fair, I had to see it twice before I was convince - the first time was preceded by too much hype around this film \\"revolutionizing sex\\" in cinema.  Once I realized that is not what the movie is doing or trying to do, I realized it was a story of several friends I had never met.  A little crazy, a bit confused, searching, oversexed.  These stories are pulled from the actors' and director's personal experiences and, despite the blur of human emotions, they speak all the more clearly because of it.  <br /> <br />And though a bit glammed up for the camera, \\"Short Bus\\" will be seen as a slice of very real life in this era - not a mock-up dream of bygone days.

0374105235|5.0|This book, although heartbreaking to read, is beautifully written. Beah captures his emotions and thoughts so effortlessly that you feel as if you are walking alongside him on his journeys. This book shows how the strength of Beah's moral character helps him overcome the evil that he is forced to witness and participate in. A truly absorbing read.
0618680004|5.0|purchasing this book as part of my learnings in psychology... <br /> <br />sadly, if you have ever experimented in the parallel spiritual world (non-material, not sensed by our 5 senses), one would know there is another existential level - dominated by forces of good and evil - more powerful than hydrogen bombs or human ideologies.. and yes, science itself. <br /> <br />i am in favor of more sciencitifc empiracal knowledge and its vast disemenation throughout the world at low cost - instead of just to the most priviledged in societies...  All in favor of it - in fact, so was the serpent in the book of Genesis - the sooner man rejects religion in favor or pure humanism - the sooner our one world government and rule can come into existence - ruled and domminated for an extremely short period of time by the wealthy and powerful - only thing - as an observer of that time to come - i realize all hell will break out on Earth as has been foreseen in our Christain and other bibles - with a 100 percent correlation with no variance and 100 percent validity stamp from other prophecies. <br /> <br />Maybe it will come in 10 years..  maybe 50 or 5..  Who would know right ? <br /> <br />So enjoy your Earthly existence..  I would agree 100 percent with you that you have nothing in the future after death to look forward to..  and the Christain bible will tell you exactly the same thing. <br /> <br />Enough with the conflicts of knowledge versus spiritual nature of our beings...  they both have faults and they both are correct... and have their roles in our destiny as humans...  so enjoy being who you are - soul-less or soul-filled :) <br /> <br />JM <br />Texas, USA
B000N3SRRC|5.0|It's a long-standing tradition for rockers to turn to the blues as they get older and wiser. The maturing Clutch, masters of twisted and subversive heavy rock, have embraced the blues as the next step in their creative development. This release consolidates the new sounds developed on the last Clutch album, and these rocker dudes, who have done mind-boggling things with every style from hardcore to metal to funk, have fully incorporated rowdy blues rock into their singular musical vision. Songs like \\"The Devil & Me,\\" \\"Electric Worry,\\" and \\"Black Umbrella\\" (which even includes a harmonica solo) are clearly descended from traditional blues, with Clutch sounding like an especially anarchic Savoy Brown. And since Clutch will always rumble headlong into new musical territories, this album features several progressions, like the spooky \\"White's Ferry\\" and the slowly rumbling \\"Opossum Minister.\\" But rest assured that we're still in gearheadland, thanks to the classic pummeling Clutch crunch of \\"Power Player\\" and \\"Mr. Shiny Cadillackness,\\" which are crucial links to the band's heavy past.<br /><br />While the fellas may be mellowing out a little bit, their playing is still top-notch, as heard in Jean-Paul Gaster's piledriving (and surprisingly nimble) drumming and Dan Maines' dexterous rumbling basslines, while Tim Sult has seamlessly converted his traditional vertiginous stoner-metal riffage into this album's bluesy chord progressions. Here we are also witnessing the great benefit of the addition of keyboardist Mick Schauer (now on his second full album with the band), who successfully adds slightly arcane and off-kilter Memphis licks to the existing Clutch attack. And regardless of the ever-changing influences that Clutch bring to their sound with each album, the band will always remain unmistakable thanks to the unique vision of Neil Fallon, whose vehement vocals and shrewdly subversive lyrics remain the band's calling cards. This time around, Neil seems to be zeroing in lyrically on the pathetically simplistic ideals of an under-informed American society, as seen in tracks like \\"You Can't Stop Progress\\" and \\"When Vegans Attack,\\" which both skewer know-it-all protestors who don't understand what they're protesting (that's my educated guess on the always inscrutable Neil, as it were). Clutch are maturing impressively, and while they're not yet your serious dads, they're at least your eccentric rockin' uncles.

B000M06K5C|4.0|I've come to Bloc Party with no preconceptions.  I don't own the first CD, heard some of it drunk one night at my bother's place (\\"listen to this\\", \\"hey not bad, who's that\\", \\"Bloc Party\\", \\"oh yeah\\") and frankly can't remember anything about it all ...     Then just a couple of days ago, I saw the vid to \\"The Prayer\\" and was very impressed.  So I bought this CD yesterday and have given it a quick blast in the car.    It's really good.  Guitar driven, kind-of hard-edged pop if that makes sense.  Only on first listen mind, I sense a descendant of the Cure or XTC or even at a stretch whispers of Echo and the Bunnymen's better (less pompous) moments.  A couple of tracks \\"The Prayer\\" and \\"Kreuzberg\\" have depth and power reminiscent of Interpol (but not of their roots in JD).  Reading between the lines I assume the first album must have been more post-punk and those who loved that struggle with this one.  c'est la vie.  If I'm right, Bloc Party has added some depth to its work.    But as I say, I have no such reference point and on first listen have found a refreshing and intriguing CD, well worth adding to the collection.
B000M3452Y|5.0|Don't talk to James Murphy about maturity. The purveyor of the first cowbell revival of the 21st century has seen it all before. Here, Mr. DFA builds on the success of debut smash `LCD Soundsystem' and relative acclaim of Nike-sponsored jog soundtrack '45:33' to bring in something equal in warm calculation as it is to dance-friendly smiles on your face. <br /> <br />Opener \\"Get Innocuous\\" is reminiscent of Casio-chop debut single \\"Losing My Edge\\", with tasty space and Telex-induced bassline to boot. <br />Tour Anthem 2007 duties go to \\"North American Scum\\", an affair effectively indebted as much to the glam of Sweet as it is to the post-disco tendencies of 1980s New York City. <br /> <br />Murphy is happy to point out that he might be showing his age. <br />Although endlessly rhythmic and throbbing, middle-order batter \\"All My Friends\\" signals a shift on \\"Sound Of Silver\\" from frantic to wistful, (\\"\\"wouldn't trade one stupid decision/For another five years of life\\") . <br />On his deathbed he isn't, but Murphy knows he can't keep miles ahead of the pack forever. Let's hope he never becomes a sweating, faceless member of the chasing dance pelaton. <br />

B000O174CM|4.0|The performances in this movie were excellent.  The music was above average but I don't think it compares well to earlier musicals done by Hollywood during the supposed \\"Golden Era\\" of the genre.  The subjects of the movie were most fascinating and the strongest part of the film; most people didn't get to see what happened behind the scenes of the music industry when music went from an interest to an obsession in the American collective conscious in the 60's and 70's.  It certainly deserved the Oscar nominations it recieved this year.
B00005JM02|5.0|Loved this movie from start to finish! Delightful!

1576462676|5.0|I can't add anything new to the already glowing reviews for this masterpiece. One needs to have an appreciation for the time period to truly enjoy this comic 19th century irony. Worth any literate and intelligent person's time, and should be on every woman's 'lifetime reading list'. BRAVO!
B00005JM0B|4.0|Really great effects and sound that will truly test your home theater quality.  The storyline suffered until the second half of the movie when the Terminator starts filling in the pieces on what's going on and why.  Then there is a bit of a surprise at the end that in hind-sight fits the movie.  Overall, get the movie because of the effects, not because of a storyline, this way you won't be disappointed when a minor one shows up.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Spectacular setting, characters, costume, overall depiction of late 18th / early 19th century. Of course a viewer cannot fully appreciate this film unless she has read- at length -the novel of the same name penned by Jane Austen. Take the time to read the classic, then consider this your dessert! Enjoy.
B000N3ST8O|4.0|This is a pretty good package of Stevie's career - I really enjoyed the DVD with her colorful, sometimes funny comments included with the videos. The CD has the original version of \\"Silver Springs\\" a remastered \\"Edge of Seventeen\\" and the excellent \\"Planets of the Universe.\\" I wish Stevie would have included her phenominal, explosive live \\"Rhiannon\\" from the  1976 \\"Rosebud\\" film. And she put nothing from \\"Sreet Angel\\" on here the CD - it had a couple of good songs on it that should'nt have been ignored. And \\"Nightbird\\" from 1983 would have been nice to have as well. And perhaps \\"Trouble in Shangri-La,\\" my favorite Stevie song of the last decade.  But I realize this was supposed to be a highlights package, and it succeeds.

B000H0MKGK|4.0|People might not want to take my review for John Mayer's latest album Continuum seriously because I am a big fan of his. Well, I did listen to the album thoroughly, and I stand by my rating because of the quality of the music, not the artist. (Well, maybe the album deserves 3-3/4 stars, but I only rate by whole stars and half-stars, so I rounded it up.)<br /><br />When John formed the blues band John Mayer Trio a year or so ago and then issued Try, I didn't pick it up simply because I prefer to SEE live performances rather than hear them (although I did catch some live performances of some of the tunes on VH1, AOL and on The Tonight Show). And THIS album seems to be a continuation of ALL of his albums, as there are a few blues-induced tracks to be found, including \\"Gravity\\" and \\"Vultures\\", two songs he introduced while in the John Mayer Trio. Other songs in this vein are \\"Dreaming With a Broken Heart\\" and \\"Slow Dancing In a Burning Room\\".<br /><br />But the best song on the album is probably the lead single \\"Waiting On the World to Change\\", an otherwise played-out topic with a unique vibe. The only original song on here I couldn't get into is \\"Belief\\" (but I said the same thing about \\"Daughters\\" from Heavier Things, and that song ended up winning a Grammy -- although John himself said that he didn't want that song to be a single). And although John's cover of Jimi Hendrix's \\"Bold As Love\\" isn't bad, it really doesn't help or hurt the album. But everything else makes this album a continuum worth encompassing yourself in.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert

0689865384|5.0|I've been reading this book to my seventh graders for read aloud.  I hear moans and groans when time's up for reading, and they always beg me to read more.  Of course, the writing provides great opportunities for cliff hangers.  Students often enjoy books I read to them, but I've never had such a strong reaction before.  Students are pleading with their parents to buy them the book and the sequels, and actually going to the public library on their own to check out copies.  If you teach students who don't like to read, you must invest in a copy of this book.
B000NDIAWO|5.0|and nowadays it is so rare.  the re-release of this album is the best thus far this year.  the additional songs are just what *b'day* needed to bring it up to the standards the world holds beyonce to.  the original was fun, and i loved the songs for what they were--fun, pop songs, but the added ballads are so sweet and beautiful and truly make the album more well-rounded.  well worth the re-release. <br /> <br />it is also a treat hearing beyonce sing in spanish.  sometimes her spanish pronunciation is better than her english--she takes to singing in the language that well.   <br /> <br />anyway, i &lt;3 this album, and it is a part of my [non-rock] pop music favorites over the past few years along with *the emancipation of mimi* and *alright, then*. <br /> <br />my favorites are flaws and all (best beyonce song ever!), get me bodied (love that louisiana shout-out!), freakum dress (teach the children!) and irreplaceable (had to grow on me, but, oh...once it did!)

B000M3452Y|3.0|Okay, I can maybe see the yuppie, artsy, weirdo people who're different just to be different get into this, but otherwise I just don't see the big deal about this album.  It's okay, but nothin' to praise or get awards over.  All this is, is a gateway album for people that don't normally listen to electronic music to do so.  That's all fine & dandy, but don't give away any awards over it.  The music is okay, the lyrics...well for the most part are okay, but the guy's voice makes you wanna go start punching people, kinda like when someone's running their finger nails down a chalkboard.  For the most part, this is just really mediocre stuff.  I just don't see what the big deal is.  If you wanna praise an electronic album, there are far more far superior albums that deserve your attention & praise.

One must experience the Blues to play the Blues.  Really good effort though.

The costumes are great, too. The scenery, being in front of a real castle, gave the show a special feel of magic. The special features at the end of the DVd give an insight into what it takes for a production like this to come together.<br /><br />This is my second album from Celtic Woman, I was introduced to their music by PBS, and cannot wait for future albums and DVD's.

B0000C9JFO|3.0|I thought tht *L'Auberge Espagnole* would have an international mixture of \\"Real World\\" drama.  Nah, these roommates are too mellow for drama.  There was no serious conflicts that would appeal me to the movie.  It seems that their conflicts or serious issues were cheating on their boyfriends or girlfriends because of the long-distance thing.  Ok, is that the message?  If you go abroad for a long period of time, you're gonna end up having affairs with other people?<br /><br />With a promise of a lucrative job related to Spanish economics, Xavier takes advantage of an Erasmus program which allows students to study abroad.  It's sort of like a foreign exchange program.  Xavier leaves behind his hippie mother and girlfriend (Audrey Tautou) in France for a year in Barcelona.<br /><br />After 2 brief stays with a family friend and strangers, Xavier finally lands an apartment with international roommates.  All seems to be fine and dandy.  They get to know each other and talk about each other.  However, some of the roommates start to have affairs behind their boyfriends and girlfriends that they've left behind in their homeland.  Xavier is no different.  He falls for the lonely wife of the stranger that he first met at the airport when he landed in Barcelona.<br /><br />There's no real story plot.  There's no story on Xavier's schooling or for any of the roommates.  There's no stories among the roommates other than feeling the temptation to cheat on their significant others.  There is a variety of conversation among the roommmates.

0743454537|4.0|This novel grabbed me from page one, and I enjoyed it from start to finish. One can't help but be drawn in to the story of a young girl who says \\"Enough\\" to being used for replacement parts for her sister, who has cancer. I found myself caring about everyone in the family, with my sympathies shifting, as each chapter shifts in its first person narrator. While I did feel manipulated, I didn't mind. Where the novel goes too far is with the relationship between the lawyer and the legal advocate for the girl. Their former relationship gets resurrected, and feels like a light-weight romantic novel. That said, it felt like a GOOD light-weight romance, and I even enjoyed that part of the book, which felt less authentic to me. This novel was well written, filled with enough details to make the characters real and interesting. While young Anna's thoughts were expressed in ways that few 13 year olds would express them, she was an authentic and engaging character, and the anchor to this novel. While this was not great literature, it was an engaging read and did provide some interesting ideas to consider. My wife read this first and passed it on to me. While it probably sells to a female audience, it really is a family novel, and this middle-aged male enjoyed it a lot. It would be an engaging book to young readers as well.
B000EYK2GE|5.0|I have this on VHS and now on CD, but it needs to be on DVD.  Classic show, classic line-up, and the first time 2 Beatles performing together (and the last until Concert For George) since Bangladesh.  When Carl breaks up at the end telling everyone how much he appreciated all of his friends it will bring a lump to the throat of any fan of his or of \\"roots\\" rock & roll.  Seldom does one get to play with people of that calibre and the love they obviously have for the songs is eclipsed by the love they had for Carl himself, a class act all his life.
076790382X|5.0|Bill Bryson's \\"I'm a Stranger Here Myself\\" is one of my favorite books at it combines thoughtful insights about his family and culture with laugh out loud humor. Many of his observations are, however, serious and shocking. How America had 800,000 lawyers in 1999 more than the rest of the world out together. Bryson says that breaks down to 300 lawyers for 100,000 citizens whereas Briton by contrast has 82 and Japan 1.<br /><br />Bryson also points out how the Gross Domestic Product GDP is a dismal measure of national income as it shows the amount of dollars we spend, both good and bad, on services over a given period. Bad activities like the O.J. Simpson's $200 million trial, New York City's cleanup after 9/11 and reckless pollution often generate more GDP. A leading economist joked, \\"According to the GDP the nation's economic hero is a terminal cancer patient going through a costly divorce.\\" Another economist pointed out, \\"The current national accounting system treats the earth as a business in liquidation.\\"<br /><br />In a lighter vein Bryon shares stories about his somewhat inept memory. He said his family suggested some labels suitable for him, \\"Caution: When Door Says `Pull' It's Absolutely No Use Pushing\\" and \\"Warning: Do Not Attempt to Remove Sweater Over Head While Walking Among Chairs and Tables.\\" His favorite was \\"Caution: Ensure That Shirt Buttons Are in Correct Holes Before Leaving the House.\\"

What an excellent, funny book (I almost NEVER laugh out loud while reading, but I did for this one) and I couldn't help but think of Bonfire of the Vanities book which I also loved.  Though the stories are different,  ALL characters are mockeries of themselves and it's all very sarcastic yet realistic.  I love when the characters are \\"live people\\" to me, I think about them even after I put the book down.  The story is realistic and whimsical.  It's very serious, very sad, very funny, wow, I finished it last week and can't stop thinking about the characters.  Jones is my favorite character, a poor black guy, that is constantly saying things as they really are.  Please read it!

B000002J0N|5.0|This was the first in a long line of \\"comeback\\" albums for Crosby, Stills, & Nash, and in my opinion is the best of their latter releases.  This album was a big hit in the US when it was released in 1977, climbing to number 2 on the Billboard album chart.  It produced CSN's first top ten single \\"Just A Song Before I Go\\" and minor follow-up hit \\"Fair Game.\\"  Though in my opinion the best song on the album is \\"Dark Star\\", why it wasn't released as a single is a mystery to me!  A very strong album!
1592401791|5.0|I could not put this gem of a book down.Finally a real insider is writing something.Someone who spent hours with the fabs,day after exciting day.I'd first like to say that unlike a lot of reviewers I feel that Mr. Emerick has the right to have a favorite Beatle and it's also his perrogative that it happens to be Paul.Why are so many people angry about this?This man worked very closely with the four and knew them for many years.He's not influenced by the media image of the Beatles.He's going by personal experience.And he's certainly not the first person who has found Paul easier to work with than the others.It is also not a mammoth surprise that he sights Paul as the best all around musician in the group.Anyone with any  knowledge of the Beatles' music already knows this.And just about every book that covers the Beatles music in any meaningful way has gone into detail about this.Check it out.Are they sad because he didn't pay tribute to John and George?Well actually he admires them both very much if you were paying attention.He goes into a lot of detail about John's beautiful songs especially Strawberry Fields.He also discusses John's volatile personality and his experiences with him,both good and bad.This makes for very interesting reading because most of the stories he tells have never been heard before.These are Geoff's personal experiences.I do disagree with his oppinion on George's guitar work.He describes him as \\"not a good player\\" when the boys first started recording in 1962,then goes on to say that as time went on,he became a superior player.I think he was superior from day one.Geoff seems to be missing the point here.While it's obvious that George seemed to make a lot of mistakes and it took take after take to get the solos right,(other Beatle scholars have noted this; i.e.Richie Unterberger in The Beatles Unreleased Music and Film)Emerick fails to say the obvious.First of all George's solos were pretty advanced and intricate.It took a lot of work to get them right and to think them up in the first place.Secondly,George was obviously more nervous in the studio then he was on stage.Especially in the early years.He was the baby after all,and who wouldn't be nervous working with two geniouses like Lennon and McCartney? The studio was their oasis.A place for them to excell and show off their brilliance.They were comfortable there.George probably felt inferior especially when Paul was called in to 'fix'his solos and would always effortlessly play in one take, what it had taken George all day to do.But Paul wasn't nervous.John and Paul \\"oozed self confidence\\",according to Geoff.Okay,Geoff's take on Ringo is pretty hard to handle.While I think he loves Paul,admires John,and likes George,he clearly does not like Ringo Starr,and seems to have a personal grudge against him.But I think this is because of a major incident that happens toward the end of the book,around 1970.You'll know when you read it.I won't give it away.Also I think Rings had a personal dislike of Geoff too,judging from the way he acted around him.It was out of line to call Ringo \\"simple\\" though.That's really pushing it.By the way,he's not the first person who has described Ringo as cold and moody.Again because we don't know him,we tend to beleive his cuddly,clown,media image.Like he does with George's playing ,Geoff also misses the point when he talks about Ringo's skills as a drummer.He babbles about Ringo's dimunitive size and says this is why he wasn't a powerful drummer.Oh? You mean like Kieth Moon and John Bonham? That's exactly the point! Ringo was a subtle, artistic drummer.He never did self absorbed solos,and his kicks and fills were brilliant,and peerless.His idols were Gene Krupa,and Buddy Rich.Yeah jazz drummers.Ringo was the best rock drummer ever,bar none.Just listen.This book gives an interesting background on Geoff's life before The Beatles,telling exactly how, and what led a 15 year old techie into EMI that June day in 1962.The same week the boys from Liverpool were doing their audition for George Martin.Their lives become intertwined in September,when Geoff is assigned to their recording session and many more after that.Then in 1966 he's promoted to sound engineer, just in time to record the greatest album of all time,Revolver.The rest is Grammy winning history.You can be a fly on the wall inside studio two and read about the making of the greatest pop music of all time by the greatest band ever.The only music Geoff was not privy to was Rubber Soul and Help,sadly.One more great thing;Geoff goes into detail about Paul's bass playing on Sgt.Pepper and the hours of hard work he puts in, to make it perfect.Paul's perfectionism is part of what made the Beatles so great in the first place.Add this book to your collection.You will be glad you did.
B000002ITW|4.0|This album was a big hit in the US when it was released in 1971, climbing all the way to number 1 on the Billboard album chart.  The performances are raw but effective.  I especially like the last part of the album, when they go \\"electric.\\"  Their extended, blistering performance of \\"Carry On\\" is alone worth the price of the album!
B00008GKEG|5.0|If you never buy anything else pertaining to the Beatles,you must have this one DVD boxed set and the book that goes with it.Amazon's price is unbeatable,by the way.This is about 10 hours of complete Beatles history.The best pictures,concert footage,sound,etc.than any other Beatles DVD.This set is so superbly put together that it takes your breath away.I can't describe it.Just buy it and you will know what I mean.My favorite parts?Well everything,but the rare TV footage is priceless.The Shea Stadium concert is in gorgeous color and quite a lot of it is included.The EMI studio chat both for the early years and the White album is fantastic!Yeah,two sections where you hear nothing but snippits of conversation from the studio.Loved it.There's the boys' promo films for Paperback Writer and Rain.This is rare stuff and it's all here.Nothing is left out.It spans the years 1940-1970 just to give you an idea of the gargantuan tome you will be enjoying.Plus a bonus DVD which is facinating.Oh how could I forget?!There is a lot of concert footage also;ie,France in 1965 not '64,Blackpool Night Out from June 1965,and other marvelous concert footage.I'm a little annoyed about one reviewer who entitled his review \\"McCartney Grudge\\"and went on to say that Paul somehow fixed it so that John was edited out of the press conferences.Oh yeah,big bad Paul took the time out to do this. He also had time to wash everyone's cars in the parking lot and shampoo their dogs too.But he wouldn't wash Yoko's car.Whatever.Also one person noted George's discomfort being around Paul during the commentary.That's funny,because I saw Paul biting his nails and choosing his words very carefully whenever he was with the other two.It's no wonder since everything is always big bad Paul's fault.Enough already.If Paul McCartney ruffled George's feathers it's only because Paul was in his own little world in the studio.His only concern was making perfect music.The music he heard in his head.And John wasn't exactlysleeping either.If Paul stepped on some toes,oh well.The guy was a pop genious, a modern day Mozart.So was John for that matter.Geniouses always have volitile personalities,and they are usually perfectionists too.And thank God for that!Now we can sit back and enjoy the results of that genious every time we play a Beatles record.Anyway this DVD is the only one you need in your collection,but  if you love the Beatles as much as I do you will want more.
B000NDIAWO|4.0|The release of the original version of B'Day came at the perfect time in my life. It came out the day before I had to return to work after my summer break and I was depressed, not only by that, but also by other things going on in my life. On September 5, 2006, I went to the music store and bought two copies. (I now own four copies, including the deluxe edition). I opened it and shoved the CD in my car stereo. What I heard changed my life. The songs were flawlessly produced and Beyoncé's vocal delivery was energetic, enthusiastic, swaggering, powerful and charismatic. Every song was amazing. Never have upbeat songs been graced with such beautiful, complex harmonies! It is now my favorite album of all time, even though I have had countless people shake their heads and laugh at this statement. (I plan to have many more after posting this review, too.)  This album offered me an escape from my problems that even Mary J. Blige's My Life and Me'Shell NdegéOcello's Bitter couldn't bring to me, and for this I am thankful. <br />  <br />Considering this, I promise to give an absolutely truthful review that will answer the essential question at hand: does it live up to, or is it better than, the original? I feel no need to review songs from the original because you've most likely heard them on the radio, bought the album and/or seen the videos. Plus, I pretty much thought it was flawless.  <br />  <br />There has been some confusion and I'd like to clear it up. The deluxe edition is a two-disc set. It comes with the expanded version of the original and a bonus disc with Spanish songs. It does NOT come with all of the videos. To obtain the videos recorded for each song, there is a DVD that you must buy separately from the CD set, which is exclusively available at Wal-Mart stores and on their website, or at least for the time being. (By the way, the DVD is definitely worth the purchase. The videos are amazing and very amusing.) Now that we've got that cleared up... let's moveon to the new additions. <br />  <br />\\"Beautiful Liar,\\" which was initially leaked on the Internet with only Beyoncé's vocals in November, is a little disappointing.  It has a great theme and the song is alright, but the production is a little stale and uninspired to me. I also don't think Shakira's vocals mix well with Ms. Knowles'. Either way, it is pretty enjoyable and the dramatic, almost opera-like vocals from both women are nice. Can't say it fits the environment of the overall album, though.  <br />  <br />The next new track, \\"Welcome To Hollywood,\\" is simply a version of Jay Z's \\"Hollywood\\" with only Beyoncé singing. Nothing more, nothing less. (Good thing she left him out, because he already appears on here twice.) I wasn't a big fan of the song in the first place and always found the production to fall flat, but this version is an improvement. I love her blasting vocals and she gives the song a more cohesive sound. <br />  <br />Now \\"Flaws & All\\" is what I'm talking about! A common complaint towards the original B'Day was it barely had any ballads that made her debut such a hit. Here, B delivers a beautifully confessional song where she admits she has flaws and glitches. In the first few seconds of the song, she declares \\"I'm a train wreck in the morning / I'm a b---h in the afternoon.\\" Wow! She has ups and downs, but her man (cough cough, Jay Z) loves her anyway, and that's why she loves him. It truly is beautiful and the melody is amazing. This is a welcome addition to the album, for me. <br />  <br />\\"Still In Love (Kissing You)\\" is another superb ballad, which was originally done by Desiree for the Rome + Juliet soundtrack. Beyoncé inserts some of her own lyrics to make the song more personal and she definitely does the song justice. It took a few listens to get used to because the production is very minimal, but it is a beautiful track nonetheless.  In the last few seconds of the song, she proclaims that she loves her man \\"more than music.\\" And we know how much she loves music. It's very touching and romantic. <br />  <br />The last new addition to the first disc is a hidden track that comes after \\"Listen.\\" It is titled \\"World Wide Woman,\\" which leaked on the Internet earlier this year. It has a very laid-back, spring/summer feel to it and I personally love it. It doesn't necessarily fit with the rest of B'Day, but I suppose that's why it's hidden. I'm glad it was included, though. <br />  <br />It was originally intended that Beyoncé would release a Spanish album, but that apparently fell apart. To not put the tracks to waste, some of them were put on the bonus disc, which is pretty much here just for added value. It includes the \\"Spanglish\\" version of \\"Beautiful Liar,\\" which was actually the original version before Shakira stepped in. It features Sasha, Beyoncé's alter-ego, on the Spanish lines. I personally prefer this version to the original. The \\"remix\\" is not much different from the original, kind of useless. Same background music and everything. The version of \\"Beautiful Liar\\" completely in Spanish, \\"Bello Embustero,\\" is also included. \\"Irreemplazable,\\" the Spanish version of the ten-week number one hit \\"Irreplaceable\\" is very nice. The beautiful tone of her voice is preserved even when she is singing in Spanish and it sounds quite authentic. The same applies to \\"Listen (Oye).\\" I was rather impressed. \\"Amor Gitano\\" is enjoyable. But the real treat is the Nortena Remix of \\"Irreemplazable.\\" It has accordions in it! Quite a refreshing combination! <br />  <br />So, back to the essential question: does it live up to the original? Was it worth it? As a fan, I was ecstatic for some new material. But for the casual music listener... it may not be necessary. \\"Still In Love (Kissing You),\\" \\"Flaws & All\\" and \\"Worldwide Woman\\" were welcome additions, but I would've preferred to have tracks such as \\"Creole,\\" \\"Lost Yo Mind\\" or numerous others to replace \\"Beautiful Liar\\" and \\"Welcome To Hollywood.\\" (I wish she would release an album of all the songs not released and call it B'Sides... eh?) Also, the addition of the new songs sacrifices the cohesive environment which existed in the original. The bonus disc feels out place. It is really not essential and it would've been much better if the DVD were included, even if it did raise the price tag a bit.  <br />  <br />Bottom line: Overall, it's still great, but it doesn't live up to the original for me because now there is some filler that pollutes this album. If you are a fan, this is excellent. If you are more of a casual listener and you have already purchased B'Day, I would listen to samples (which are readily available all over) and see if you think it's worth it. You probably won't find it absolutely necessary, even though the price is right, kids!
B000LE1FAY|5.0|I've always adored Belinda Carlisle and have been quite disappointed that she hasn't released an album (sans the Go-Gos) since \\"A Woman and a Man\\" over 10 years ago.  She definitely has matured and does a fantastic job with this album that's totally in French (plus a 4-single CD in English).  If you'd like to hear what Madeleine Peyroux ([[ASIN:B0002NRRAG Careless Love]]) would sound like with a beat of an upbeat tempo, this may be the CD for you.  It's great for listening as music in the background or for driving in the car when you want a little pick-me-up.  Congrats, Belinda!
0393324818|5.0|In 1989 I saw the movie Field of Dreams and it changed my life forever, making me a baseball fan with its love for the game. Moneyball by Michael Lewis would be the second life changing event in my baseball evolution, teaching me aspects of the game that I never even knew existed. Lewis presents how the Oakland As, with one of the lowest payroles in the game, continually make the playoffs with underrated talent and intelligence.  <br /> <br />Lewis introduces such things as Bill James, SABR, on base percentage, and other concepts that have opened a treasure trove of information for making a person a more complete fan. I promise if you read this book you will never look at the game the same way again and for the better.
B000N3ST9I|5.0|Machine Head slipped with 'The Burning Red' (1999) & 'Supercharger' in 2001, but since then the band has released 2 solid & INTENSE metal albums & continues to prove in my opinion that they continue to get heavier & better as time goes on. And for all of these 'Burn My Eyes' freaks, PLEASE get over it, Machine Head has released better albums since that album & 'The Blackening' could be the best yet! If you want extreme metal that sounds GREAT, then buy this album!
B000MCH5TK|4.0|Definitely worth watching...  Picture quality and sound quality are great.  Plays fine on the PS3.
B000002N2P|2.0|I liked the first Green Day work - it was original, a bit too punky and whitetrash for me, but decent to listen too.  After dropping VERY large money for the last two albums I realized I was buying the same music just repackaged.  Even the Live versions on Foot In mouth sound exactly the same.  Save your money; either buy one of the first 2-3 albums of theirs or better yet, try something new.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|As with all music, the review will be based on peoples specific tastes in music. it is impossible to trust a review of a song to tell you what to buy. that being said, i'd have to say that i personally love far cry. it reminded me somewhat of The Spirit of Radio. as much as i love the synth work, and especially the basslines as with Ghost Rider, i'd say this is a great return to a great time period for them. --By-Tor
B000AP04NI|5.0|This version of \\"Oklahoma\\" will always remain my favorite. Gordon McRae and Shirley Jones are sheer perfection. Every single Rodgers and Hammerstein song including \\"Oh What a Beautiful Morning,\\"\\"People Will Say We're in Love,\\" \\"The Surrey With the Fringe on Top,\\" \\"I'm Just a Girl Who Can't Say No,\\" and the title song are romantic, humorous, original and beautifully sung and directed. This show is considered the quintessential American musical and after experiencing the amazing on-location sets, costumes, choreography by Martha Graham, dream sequence, and charming and delightful overall mood of this movie, you'll be humming these tunes for days!
B00005JLKN|5.0|\\"Red Dragon\\" is a very interesting piece of modern cinema. It is scary, filled with action and suspence and has a very subtle underlying sense of humour. The cast performs very well, Anthony Hopkins reprising his probably most well known role as evil incarnate, Hannibal Lecter, and Edward Norton giving a performance nothing short of sheer brilliance. Norton was not really my bag prior to seeing this movie, but he performs so well that it immediately changed my mind. We can quite easily identify with his troubles, his tormented self and can almost hear the gears churning when he investigates a murder scene. Ralph Fiennes also delivers a great performance as the twisted murderer the \\"tooth fairy\\". There is a subtle feeling of madness underscoring the rage in him. Very good indeed. Very notable also is Philip Seymour Hoffman as the hack writer Freddy Lounds. In the short screen time that he has he still manages to leave us all with a very deep impression. In fact, the movie is, in a word, well cast and well performed.  <br /> <br />The direction, editing and scoring of the film is equally up to par and really captures the mood perfectly.  <br /> <br />The ending, as another reviewer remarked, is, although similar to the one in the book, not as powerful. This is probably because of the crowdpleasing factor. It is after all a hollywood movie. Then again, one shouldn't measure it against the book, but see it as an independent picture.  <br /> <br />In short: this is definitely a film to watch. Highest possible recommendation.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I purchased this on a whim while in Iraq just before St. Patrick's day.  Now I wake to this wonderful collection of music every morning!
B000000993|4.0|It's cool.  I had this \\"tape\\" several years ago and it got eaten by my player. I always wanted the CD so I got it. It is as good as I remember it being.
B000N6TX1I|1.0|The whole time I was watching this movie I could not help but think how impossible this premise is since we are mamals and according to Darwin there is genetic abnormalities that allow the species to continue.  <br />I got the same feeling from watching \\"The Day after tomorrow\\" as being impossible. <br /> <br />The production budget was 75 million and they only took in 35 million for a reason. This is not art house material, but the same \\"the government is evil and society will break down in the future\\" non-sense. <br />Yes the camera work is good and the colors look great on HD, but still can not make up for the ridiculous premise. It reminds me of a theory term paper where we say, what would happen if all women could no longer could have kids then went on for 15 pages on the aftermath of the ending of the species. Very Sophomoric <br /> <br />If you want an apocolyptic London movie that's somewhat believable watch \\"28 Days later\\". Or if you would like to go in the fantasy realm watch \\"Escape from New York\\". <br /> <br />If you want a depressing drama, still skip this because the ending is very very boring and unsatisfying. <br />
0618680004|5.0|Dawkins does not let religion off the hook by being polite and pretending that \\"faith\\" is anything other than a synonym for ignorance. The book is a little repetitive but it reads quite well. I have given it 5 stars because of the important argument it brings to the world. Superstitious people will hate it but those with open, healthy minds will love it.
1582701709|4.0|I have followed \\"The Secret\\" since my class in metaphysics years ago. It works for me!  I enjoyed reading the book.  I truly believe that like attracts like, love attracts love, and visualization and concentrating on what you want works.  I highly recommend this book.
6305558167|4.0|I enjoyed this book as it was sort of based on the series of books based on \\"Merlin\\" and his life.  This movie follows closely to historical accounts, but the fantasy scenes are pretty good.....hated the ending, loved the movie.
B000000IRB|5.0|This recording speaks for itself in terms of production quality; this is a long-standing reference recording. The MFSL Gold CD version of this CD is EXCELLENT. I have been a part of the ultra high-end audio industry for over 30 years and only listen to reference quality systems; this transfer is incredibly well done. There are no gain (volume issues) or any lack of resolution in any area. I don't think the performance advantages over the standard and SACD versions are subtle. This is well worth the investment, and becoming rare. Buy it while its available ~
B0000024IE|5.0|...Not PEs best. Without a doubt a classic, but not better than Nation of Millions, BRtS, or Apocalypse 91. 'Fear' lacked the cohesion of these others with a few missteps like: Can't Do Nuttin' For Ya Man, Reggie Jax, and 4(!) instrumentals.<br /><br />And, not the fault of PE, or the song, which was good when it came out, but Fight the Power was so over played I can no longer listen to it.
B000E6GBV2|3.0|music is like built to spill, without any guitar explorations. its a straight \\"by the book\\" rock album, which is good but not great. vocals are heavy on the reverb.  a mix between perry farrell and jim james , which is good but not great. i like the disc, and i play it often. its a great disc for a debut album though, and a good buy!! i have a feeling their next album will be great, BUT its on themselves to do something original and stop being someone else.
B000002N1E|3.0|I know this won't be helpful to many people, but to make this as simple as I possibly can, I bought this CD for two songs. P Control, one of the few Prince tracks that work as \\"rap\\", and The Most Beautiful Girl in the World, one of the best Prince singles ever. I ripped those two into my MP3 player and promptly shelved the CD, as there wasn't anything else on it that grabbed me. This release apparently wasn't commercially successful - I see it's been taken out of production - but the high ratings I see here make me think I might be missing something. Time to dust the Gold Experience off and give it another spin....?
B000KCHZK6|1.0|First of all, I really like Norah Jones.  I mean, I REALLY like Norah Jones.  She's the most unique female pop vocalist to come along in 20 years or so, and that's saying a lot.  But \\"Not Too Late\\" is a big ol' snooze.  There's not a single song with a hook you can hold on to, nothing here you want to hear again, nothing engaging or even entertaining.  Given that she's written most of the songs, perhaps this is the real Norah Jones.  As a big fan who's adored her previous two albums, I sincerely hope not.
B0002DKCMG|4.0|Just plain fun. Nothing to serious going on in this movie. If you are looking for a great laugh and can tolerate some foul language and nudity then this movie is for you.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Great film would recommend to anyone.  Gripping to the end and good plot.
B000MVQ9P2|5.0|This movie certainly caught me by suprise. I had read a small article pertaining to the Host online and thought I'd give it a shot. After purchasing and viewing it I have to say it was one of the best thrillers I had seen in a while. The creature is unique, but the main story focuses around the family that has to deal with a lost loved one. Very touching and very suspenseful.
B000O178BY|5.0|Year Zero is Trent Reznor making a stunning return to form after several less than stellar releases.  Nine Inch Nails made a huge impact on music with its mix of industrial beats, electronic samples and synths, and heavy guitar.  NIN reached a zenith with the release of The Downward Spiral, arguably one of the greatest albums of all time, certainly one of the greatest of the decade.  This album returns to the same formula that made The Downward Spiral so great, while in no way copying the original.  Year zero is original, innovative, and most importantly is extremely listenable.  I hit play and listened straight through enjoying every second. <br />Year Zero is a must have for any fan of the band, or any fan of the Downward Spiral.  Also reccommended for any fan of heavy music.
0893860220|5.0|Finally, I understand everything and have found the answers to my questions.  I will be reading and re-reading these words until they are second nature to me.  By far the best and only great book ever. <br />Fran O'Hare
B00005JKGK|5.0|This film involves you from the start.  It is the story of four Chinese families that centers on the Mothers and Daughters in each unit.  It reminds you that you come from somewhere and the influences of culture and family and situations makes each of us who we are.  It also speaks volumes to the fact that Mothers are human beings, and definitely worth getting to know better.<br /><br />The acting is very good.  Since Amy Tan was involved in creating the screenplay, much of the dialogue and narrative come straight from her book - which is wonderful!  Where are the people that talk like that?  This is a colorful tale that I highly recommend.
B000M3452Y|5.0|Much has been made about the growth of James Murphy, the warmth and wit of his composition and performance.  What I hear are the strong influences of some of the best and brightest bubbling up through his production.  Early on there are multi-tracked choruses that sound every bit like early Eno, followed by Jack White growl and power chords, a little Tom Tom Club sweetness, and a song to NY, NY that could easily be mistaken for the awkward sensitivity of Sparklehorse.   This is all to the good.  Music grows when styles are effectively alloyed.  And Mr. Murphy has done a great job of it.    The universal acclaim for this CD is well deserved.  This is not necessarily what you want on your stereo to keep folks dancing at some carefully choreographed clambake, but it is definitely what you want to be hearing when you're driving home at 2 am from said soiree.
B000BUKHTS|5.0|This is the story of four Chinese families that centers on the Mothers and Daughters in each unit.  It reminds you that you come from somewhere and the influences of culture and family and situations makes each of us who we are.  It also speaks volumes to the fact that Mothers are human beings, and definitely worth getting to know better.<br /><br />The writing is wonderful!  Amy Tan is very witty and engaging.  She creates very vivid pictures with her words.  This is an amazingly real tale that I highly recommend.  No wonder it spent 9 months on the NY Times Bestseller List!  The only drawback is that I would have preferred to read in trade paperback format.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I have a 17 month old son and ever since my sister bought it for him for Christmas, he's loved this movie.  Between my wife and myself we've probably watched it 100 times (at least seems like it) and we havent gotten sick of it yet.  Thats my biggest compliment for it, we still enjoy the movie each time we watch it.   <br /> <br />From Guido's awesome pit stop in the last race and Mater's \\"happier than a tornado in a trailer park\\" there's always something interesting to see in this movie.
B00006RCNW|5.0|4.5 stars.<br /><br />After hearing so much hype about this show, I finally decided to check it out.  (It's a wonderful world we live in when we can now just buy whole season of television shows).  You only have to watch the first three minutes of this show to know that this is no ordinary cop show.  And by the end of that first episode, I dare you not to have your mouth hanging open.  Michael Chiklis is a dynamite actor and does remind you of an adorable pitbull that should never ever ever play with your children.  As much as I enjoy this series-over the course of the first 13 episodes, I'd be remissed if I didn't bring up, that there are times when the dialogue comes across a bit cheesy/campy or scene sort of looks too staged.  There are plenty of risk-taking performances: Chiklis and Jace are the first ones to come to mind.  Highly highly recommended.
B000035Z1Z|5.0|My college roommates and I watched the VHS version of this movie so many times we wore the tape out. Bad day at the internship, boyfriend broke up with you, need a good movie to nap to while skipping class...this is your movie! I was so happy to find it on Amazon and even happier that it arrived so quickly and in brand new condition!
B000F1IQN2|5.0|Munich, directed by Stephen Spielberg, is a tale of revenge--its appeal and its final lunacy. It tells the story of the tragic kidnapping/murder of eleven Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympic games in Munich, Germany, and then focuses on the team of Mossad (Israeli secret police) agents who are selected to assassinate Black Septemberist functionaries (the group responsible for Munich) in retribution.  <br /> <br />The movie is searing, brutal and difficult to watch. Among Spielberg's work, it has the same sense of uncompromising reality as Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List. Technically, this film is well put-together. The acting is strong throughout. The film itself reminds one of a 70's movie, with gritty footage and muted colors. It is appropriate to the subject. Thematically, this movie shows the horrible reality of dreamed-about revenge; how politicians, from on high, make decisions over tea about how we have to \\"show people we're strong,\\" but how those decisions eventually translate into the ruin of people's lives, some of whom are innocent and some guilty, but always complex. Munich begins by showing us the Munich tragedy, and the audience immediately wants the terrorists responsible to pay. But, by showing us the actual mechanisims of the Israeli revenge (and suggesting that their revenge will simply lead to more Palestinian retribution, which we now know it did), we start to repent of our desire for that revenge. Also, awful though the thought may be, we gain some possible insight into the original Munich terrorists, and even, perhaps, a little sympathy.  <br /> <br />This is not Spielberg's finest film, but it is great. Great and heavy and not something I think I will want to watch a second time, because it is just that hard. It is essential viewing once, however, because the historical content and themes are important, present and not likely to leave us any time soon. <br />
B00005ATQ9|5.0|This film is seriously neglected in the Kubrick universe (only Eyes Wide Shut is neglected more), and it's a damn shame, as it is not only his most underrated film, it is also a masterpiece.  It is one of the most breathtaking beautiful films ever committed to celluloid.  The photography alone is enough to see it (try to see it in a theater).  As Kubrick afficionados know, the scenes that were lit by candlelight were actually shot with only candlelight.  There were no other lights used.  In these scenes, the actors don't move about too much, as there wasn't much depth of field, because of the special lenses that Kubrick used here.  They were designed specifically for this film.  Christianne Kubrick, Stanley's widow, said this was her favorite film of Stanley's, as the framing is reminiscent of paintings of the period, and Christianne is a renowned painter whose paintings were used in many of her late husband's films (like A Clockwork Orange and Eyes Wide Shut).  Ryan O'Neal is quite good as Barry, a scoundrel and a cheat who gets his comeuppance by the end of the film.  Leon Vitali (who went on to become Kubrick's personal assistant up until Kubrick died) is astonshingly good as Lord Bullingdon, Barry's stepson and nemesis.  The duel scenes (especially the 2nd one) are small masterpieces of editing, sound, and music design.  Despite the film being 3 hours, it is never boring, and there's so much to take in visually the 3 hours flies by.  It's a pleasure to sit through such a beautiful film such as this.  The film, despite being directed by the American Kubrick, has a uniquely British feel to it, enhanced by the brilliant cast of English actors, many of whom appeared in other Kubrick films (Philip Stone, Godfrey Quigley, Patrick Magee, Anthony Sharp, Steven Berkoff, and Leonard Rossiter).  Kubrick shot almost all of the film on location in castles in England and Ireland.  There were hardly any sets used.  The film won several Academy Awards (though not for Kubrick himself).  It won for cinematography, art direction, and music score.  This film was rarely mentioned by critics and film people (I remember reading about it in the World Book Encyclopedia of all things), but it's getting some long overdue recognition, and hopefully it will continue...mself).

B000H4JGZY|2.0|If this album sounded original I would appreciate it however it sounds like a bunch of throw away songs from an old Prince CD called \\"Sign O the Times.\\" Look it up. The singing style, music style are all prince sans guitar. At least he didn't steal his dancing style from prince, he got that from Usher, just like the style of his last CD. If it weren't for Timbaland there would be no originality at all on this CD. Really folks this guy's music was better when he was with NSYNC.

1401207529|5.0|So many wonderful reviews have been written here that little comment is needed. Suffice to say that this new edition probably didn't rate the \\"Absolute\\" treatment from DC mainly due to the story's brevity. Still the extras included in this new edition make it worth it. David Mazzucchelli's afterword is wonderful, not to mention his sketches, preliminary artwork gives the reader a glimpse into the makings of a comic classic. The inclusion of several pages of Frank Miller's script and Mazzucchelli's breakdowns and Richmond Lewis's new coloring have given a timeless story new life. <br />Maybe DC will release this work as an \\"Absolute,\\" edition. Failing that, this is the closest we will come to. 5 stars.
B000MXPE7O|4.0|THE GOOD SHEPHERD may take a lot of patience to sit through the nearly three hour tale written by Eric Roth (Munich, Forrest Gump, Ali, The Horse Whisperer, etc) and directed with meticulous attention to detail by Robert De Niro, but in the end the film about the creation of CIA (\\"ever notice that no one these 'the CIA' just like no one use 'the God'?\\").  And although the script confuses the viewer by its propensity to meander over many time frames and many places, the result is a tense attention holding look at the machinations of big government and frightening big Intelligence organizations.<br /><br />We first meet Edward Bell Wilson (Matt Damon, who carries the film well)  as a son who witnesses his father's suicide, a fact he will hide for years. He follows in the family footsteps of attending Yale, participating in the infamous Skull and Bones secret club, and progressed to join the government as an agent for Intelligence, eventually helping to form CIA and participate in the Cold War tension with Russia and the Bay of Pigs incident.  Wilson is a nebbish on the surface, but underneath lies a man devoted to his country and a man capable of maintaining heavy secrets, even from his wife-of-necessity Clover (Angelina Jolie) whom he marries solely because he got her pregnant.  He is distant, covert, and seemingly cold, a trait that he will pass on to his son whose life following CIA  results in tragedy.<br /><br />Along the way from this personal side of the story the plot is filled with politicians, spies, Russian, moles, double agents - all the expected and needed characters for a story of this sort.  The cast includes such important actors as Billy Crudup, Joe Pesci, Alec Baldwin, a superb Tammy Blanchard, Robert De Niro himself, Keir Dullea, Michael Gambon, William Hurt, John Turturro, Timothy Hutton and Gabriel Macht, each performing excellent cameos.  The production values are equally strong with Robert Richardson as director of photography mixing historical footage with atmospheric cinematography, a fine musical score by Bruce Fowler and Marcelo Zarvos, and a tight editing by Tariq Anwar.  The film could easily have been cut by an hour without damaging the effect, but there is something to be said for the level of tension achieved by De Niro's choices that gives us a feeling of being a part of the Intelligence schemes. It takes patience, but the film is worth viewing.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|having grown up with Sir David Attenborough's natural history programmes I was surprised to see that Planet Earth slipped under my radar. So I ordered the set From Amazon in the UK in January knowing that it will work on my DVD player as it's region free. The set arrived but I didn't have time to watch it so it sat on a shelf until I found out the the Discovery Channel was going to air the series. I suddenly remembered I had the set and decided to watch a bit of the set with my wife before the documentary aired later that night. <br /> <br />As we watched we both gasped with wonder at some of the shots of the wildlife and the filming off the various locations. We both watched the first episode on the DVD and then eagerly awaited watching the others on the Discover Channel later that night. <br /> <br />We settled down to watch the documentary and we both were in shock as the original narration by Sir David Attenborough had been replaced by Sigourney Weaver. In fact my wife couldn't watch the documentary as the narration was so bad - and she's American! So we went back to the DVDs. <br /> <br />We cannot understand why the Discovery Channel decided to replace Sir David Attenborough's narration with Sigourney Weaver but we both agree it was a very bad decision. We both like Sigourney, however she lacks any passion or warmth and appears to be speaking in a monotone voice. In particular there's a spot where in the first episode a bird clears a spot on a branch with a piece of debris from it's area so it can attract a female and Sigourney says  \\"missed a bit\\" here she could show emotion she is just so lifeless. Sir David's narration is different here and you can hear the passion in his voice. <br /> <br />Speaking for myself, if I muted the sound so I couldn't hear the narration I could instantly tell the this was a BBC production and Sir David Attenborough would be the narrator. So I'm disappointed that the Discovery Channel felt the need to use change the narration. I'm just glad that I have Sir David Attenborough's narration on the DVD as I believe that this was the way the documentary was supposed to sound.
B000MGUZM0|1.0|Come on guys, my son bought this for me saying that Michael Stipe and David Bowie raved about this band and he knew I was big fans of both. But, from the first cut to the last, it just does not go anywhere. I forget the cut, but the line is \\" I don't want to live in America anymore\\", well guess what? Head back to Canada. I suggest do not waste your money on this CD.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|Why, oh why do people insist on writing reviews that tell the whole friggin movie?  There, I've vented.  I don't know anything about the video game, but I enjoyed this film. Radha Mitchell gives a convicingly intense performance.  Alice Krige, on the other hand, is 1 flick away from being typecast! Great film for a Saturday night and a big bowl of home made popcorn!
B000MG1ZFQ|5.0|OK, I had to write a review to counter the guy who gives a caveat against buying this version of the Soft Parade. This is the 40th Anniversary remix, it's supposed to be different. If you want the original mix pick up a copy of the last release of this album. I don't see any problem with the Doors re-vamping thier catalog. I've got all the 40th Anniversary remixes and all of the last round of re-mastered CD's. What's the problem? If you're a serious Doors fan you'll dig hearing the extra stuff, I'm digging these right now. Sure these remixes are different but they don't suck. Just do a little homework before you buy and you won't be disappointed.
B00005JPCF|5.0|Me and my 10 year old laughed the whole way thru this movie it was fun and exciting and both being big fans of National Geographic channel etc he \\"got\\" the point of the movie. Its a cute way to put a very dangerous and real life peril. This will be one DVD  we watch over and over.. The music was \\"dated\\" for adults but my 10 year old step son still \\"got\\" the meaning of what was going on.. He had a blast watching this..Robin Williams did a great job with the voices and so did the others Britney Murphy etc.. <br />It may not be a dvd for a 5 year old.. but its one of the better ones to have in your collection.
B000E1MTY0|1.0|at the ratings. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen! Terrible acting, storyline and special effects! I actually threw it out. It makes Kilmer's/Clooney's versions look good and Keaton's looks like masterpieces!
B000069AUI|3.0|They've got a great sound and the occasional evocative lyric, but as Coldplay's surface appeal wears off, time seems to be revealing there's not much depth here.  The minimalism of their arrangements and, especially, writing can really be a snooze if you listen to Coldplay as anything more than background music.
B000046PVN|1.0|FIVE STAR FOR MUSIC.  1 STAR FOR AUDIO.  Ok I've wanted this recording for almost 4 years.  Now I got it.  I am a discerning listener.  This soundtrack is not the best quality.  Tape hiss is very pronounced.  You can tell it's taken directly from a cassette recording.  I have other digital recordings of this music.  They are miles ahead of this cd.  Soundtrack is on the Rhino label.  What?  Rhino is not known for high fidelity.  So it is very deceiving for one to buy a cd thinking it's John Williams conducting on a new recording in 1998 or whenever.  It's the actual 1978 recording.  Now let me unleash my rage.  This thing sounds as if it's recorded with a single microphone in a bathroom, at a truck stop.  Yes the music is phenomenal.  My favorite track is #2 Krypton.  I was hoping to discover some new hidden melodies that I've never heard in previous recording (original 1978).  Nope.  This IS the 1978 recording.  So I will be getting the Debney recording just so I can hear what I'm missing.  Love the music.  Just can't hear it.  ALL OF IT!  But cool booklet.  I can't listen to a booklet.  But I got it.  Whoopee.

B000N3SS80|5.0|Ok, I speak very little Spanish therefore I understand about 1/8 of what is being said on this CD (LOL) but, I love it!!!! I could not be happier about this purchase.<br /><br />The moment I heard the first single: \\"Qu&eacute; Hiciste\\" I can not stop listening to it. Her voice is beautiful, the music is great and the melody of the song is wonderful.<br /><br />The majority of the songs have a lot of great climaxes and build ups in them with great instruments. My favorite song from 2005's 'Rebirth' surfaces on here in Spanish: \\"Por Que Te Marchas\\" (\\"Can't Believe This Is Me\\") - this version measures right up there with the English version.<br /><br />Even though I cannot understand most of what is being said in the lyrics you can feel the emotion in Jennifers voice in each and every song.<br /><br />This CD is a must for any Jennifer Lopez fan!!!  Brilliant!<br /><br />~~~~JAC  07'
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Regardless of your view on global warming (real or fictional), the information presented in this film shows evidence that our actions are indeed impacting the atmosphere and the environment as a whole. Most of us want to feel that we are somehow isolated from the possible effects of global warming because we live in developed countries. But the truth is, we are all part of a closed system and we will all be affected regardless of the superficial reasons we use to distinguish ourselves from each other. The sooner we realize that this fact, the sooner we can all start doing something about it.
B000NDIAWO|3.0|I bought the original B'Day the day it was released and it is still in heavy rotation on my iPod. That being said, there is nothing too spectacular on this re-release. There are a total 4 new songs (left over from the original release) with several spanish versions of \\"Beautiful Liar\\" and one spanish version of \\"Irreplaceable\\".<br /><br />The highlight on this new issue is the Beyonce and Shakira duet of \\"Beautiful Liar\\". The best version being the original (which is track 1). A great mix of both artists' sounds (Beyonce's R&B/Hip Hop influence and Shakira's Latin influence). A great duet!!<br /><br />Another highlight is \\"Welcome To Hollywood\\" which feautures the already tried and true dynamic of Beyonce and Jaz-Z.<br /><br />\\"Flaws & All\\" and \\"Still In Love\\" are nothing to really brag about. They are both decent songs but, nothing really stands out about either of them.<br /><br />The rest of the songs (that were previously released) are the same versions and are remarkeable if you do not already own them.<br /><br />Beyonce sure knows how to market herself and this is all wrapped up in a neat little package.<br /><br />~~~JAC  07'

B000NA2776|5.0|Wow, WOw, WOW!!!  Where do I start? This is a brilliant CD from start to finish. Mikas voice and style are out of this world. From the moment I put this CD on my iPod and hit play I immdietlely fell in love with it. The style reminds me so much of Freddie Mercury (Queen) meets George Michael. With over the top dramaic sounds like Queen this CD pleases again and again and again.<br /><br />I cannot go on enough about this release. It is a must have. It is so upbeat, fun and different. It has crazy hooks and melodies.<br /><br />Every single song on here is hit worthy and stands out above anything that is out there right now.<br /><br />You need to run to go get this CD - you will be so pleased!!!<br /><br />~~~JAC  07'
020161622X|5.0|This book is the best book that covers programming and how to work as a programmer that I have ever read. It is down-to-earth, funny and with lots of insights. The way it is structured, with very direct recommendations, make it an ideal book to use as a base for team consensus when it concerns the really important parts of software development. This book really shines.
0891419063|5.0|I am a big military history buff.  My fascination with the subject  (and history in general) is that I try to put my self in the eyes of the people who were experiencing history at that time.  This is a story of war - the horrors and heroics - through the eyes of a boy less than 20 years old.  EB Sledge volunteered to join the marines and fought in two of the bloodiest campaigns against the Japanese - Okinawa and Peleliu. He is not a professional writer as this book was originally written as memoirs  for his family and his wife convinced him to publish.  However, this book is regarded by many as one of the best books written on war.  The book begins with him in boot camp to his refitting to a base to his first campaign as a \\"newbie\\" to the second campaign as a veteran.  It shows the horrible side of war many of us will never know.  It shows men breaking and loosing their minds.  It shows the inbred hatred of the Marines against the Japanese and vice verse - something written very little about.  US troops did not have the hatred against the European foes like they had against the Japanese.  The Japanese stopped fighting a war to win and one to ground the the US down by simply killing as many troops as possible.  Corpsman and stretcher bearers were routinely targeted.  This books leaves the reader with the full understanding of honor and the esprit de corps. It shows how intimate a bond is felt between brothers in arms.  It shows the reader what is it like to be on the froward lines for months and the horrors of being shelled and watching your closest friends die before you.  It shows the loneliness and isolation and the desperation of wanting to die.  It put me right in the midst of a war without ever having been in one.  After reading this, my hear goes out even more to soldiers who have given their lives, their sanity, and their sacrifice so that me and you have our freedom.  In context, this was a breed of men that most youth could not comprehend.  And hopefully never will have to.  This was the most realistic gripping book I have read in a long while.  I could not put it down.  For anyone who is a military history buff - put this on the top of your list.ever will have to.  This was the most realistic gripping book I have read in a long while.

B000K4X5XA|4.0|The Picture Quality is decent, not as good as Superman II: The Donner Cut...but for such an old movie, the quality is worth the money and I won't need to get this film again until they find a way to make this version obsolete... <br /> <br />I recommend this purchase on BD...even though Superman II is a better version for BD...it just makes the collection that much more worthwhile..
159562015X|5.0|You will probably find no head-snapping revelations in this book if you have already read Marcus Buckingham and Curt Coffman's First, Break All the Rules and/or Buckingham and Donald O. Clifton's Now, Discover Your Strengths (especially the latter). Nor does Tom Rath claim to offer any. Rather, this is a new and upgraded edition of the Gallup organization's previous online test (StrengthsFinder 1.0) that enables those who take it to identify and measure their talents relative to \\"more than 5,000 new personalized Strengths Insights that we have discovered in recent years.\\"<br /><br />In Rath's two previously published books, How Full Is Your Bucket? co-authored with Donald O. Clifton and Vital Friends, he shares his own reactions to an abundance of research data which reveals the importance of two separate but related forces which have profound impact on the workplace: getting strengths in alignment with work to be done and then developing them even more with strategic delegation and close supervision.<br /><br />What we have in this book, Strengths Finder 2.0, is a wealth of new research material that Rath examines with exceptional precision and uncommon eloquence. I strongly encourage each reader to take full advantage of the self-diagnostic opportunities that both Rath and the Gallup organization generously offer. Of course, once various exercises are completed, a significant challenge remains: to take effective and productive action to apply what has been learned. It is helpful to be aware of what Jeffrey Pfeffer and Robert I. Sutton so aptly characterize as the \\"knowing-doing\\" and \\"doing-knowing\\" gaps. It is also helpful to recall Peter Drucker's observation more than 40 years ago: \\"There is surely nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency what should not be done at all.\\"<br /><br />Presumably Rath agrees that, more often than not, the Yoda is right: \\"Do or do not. There is no try.\\"

B00008OLYN|5.0|This is the BEST space metal CD ever done! It is lyrically as dark as any death metal but musically closer to Pink Floyd and early King Crimson. The band uses some fascinating chord progessions and time signatures to create a consistently creepy atmosphere that is second to none. This CD is really an art rock masterpiece.
B000LXH0AE|3.0|Spoilers Below <br /> <br />This movie, much like the ending is a compromise.  Rather than trying something interesting with the concept, they instead chose to have a man with a boring and repetitive life, suddenly get a girl and get interesting.  Then as life starts to get interesting, he realizes he's about to die, which makes him truly appreciate life.  Rather than trying to do anything, the movie is so afraid to take the concept beyond the cliche boring man fines new lease on life, that movie becomes dull and predictable.  At the end, it is explained that he does not die, because a character who is willing to die is more interesting than one who does not know it.  I agree, but if a character is willing to die, him not dying makes his sacrifice without point.  This movie has moments, and picks up towards the end, but simply put, is nothing more than a compromise in every way.
B0000584V3|5.0|This is not your typical Death Metal band. Everyone marvels at their ability to go from heavy to light, but listen to what they are doing with their LEFT hands. Maybe it's their lack of formal training, maybe it's just their desire to break new ground, but no one ever told them that what they do isn't supposed to work. Mikael Åkerfeldt is writing some of the most unique material available today. Everyone compares them with King Crimson rather than their Death Metal contemporaries for a reason, their song writing is that unique. These guys definitely know more than 3 chords and 2 speeds. For those that just can't deal with the the Death Metal growls, pick up a copy of Damnation .
B000MV9026|5.0|hey everybody <br /> <br />I usually don't write reviews but I went to go see happy feet in the movies and I have it at home. I loved it! Not only was the dancing and singing awsome and cute but I loved the message. Maybe because I am a tree hugging liberal that maybe this movie is cool to me. but people are saying its bas because it was too political, too this, too that.. but doent most childrens programing have an agenda or message attached to them. what about barney with his messages of love or reading rainbow encouraging kids to read. If this movie makes a kid think about the enviroment then I think its pretty ok. It makes kids think about the creatures in this world and how we affect them. as far as the sexual tones of the movie , i can understand, but we as adults caught on to the sexual parts of the movie, while the kids just thought of it as dancing, plus a kid will watch more sexual content on a regular sitcom or music video than this movie. are they not allowed to watch tv? <br />aww well, its a great movie.. maybe for older kids if you are concerned about the stuff in the movie ( it's pg) that talks about accepting yourself and loving the enviroment

B000MNP2KI|5.0|When I first heard of the new James Bond I swore that I wouldn't watch it and it wouldn't be any good. I realize now just how wrong I was. The movie was great and had me on the edge of the seat from the very first chase scene.  <br /> <br />The DVD itself had excellent picture and sound. The bonus DVD has quite a few special features including the music video for the movie's theme song. There are some other featurettes that any Bond enthusiast should enjoy seeing as I did. Including shipping & handling I was still able to get this cheaper on Amazon than what the local WalMart and Kmart stores were seling it.

B00005J6SZ|4.0|Like A Virgin by Madonna is not a flawless album but it put her on the map. Some of the songs are sappy and lack effort and this was the first record Madonna didn't write all the tracks. But thank god, she wrote her most under-rated song ever, Angel. And of course I adore Dress you Up, Material Girl, Love Don't Live Here Anymore, and the title-track. Her vocals soar with Love Don't Live Here Anymore, it's a great cover and she pulls it off so well.  This album was hot, hot, hot when it was released back in 1984 but her music really came into its own with her most personal album, Like A Prayer. If you want depth from Madge than start with that album instead. I can see why this album is a classic, but it's not her best. Also check-out Ray of Light.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|This is one of the true movie classics of all time and the Criterion Collection has served it well.

B000JLTRKE|4.0|I do understand there are some historical inaccuracies, but honestly isn't that Hollywood for you? You don't watch a Hollywood film expecting a documentary. If you want a 9/11 documentary, tune into Discovery or History Channel. In Hollywood, you watch a good story play out on the silver screen. You're taken to another place and time then left to use your Personal Computer to do research that will help you separate fact from fiction. (or do like I said and watch Discovery Channel!)<br /><br />This story stays very close to the truth of 9/11. It stays very true to the danger, the heartache and the tragedy of the day. And it ends very triumphantly, which is the purpose. It is what can best be termed historical fiction. It's based in fact, much like Titanic was, (even features real people, much like Wyatt Earp or what have you) but contains events that have been stretched, strained, morphed, adapted, edited and deleted.<br /><br />It's called a movie!<br /><br />I believe this movie was very well done and stayed very close to the feel of the day. When it's all said and done, that's what a HOLLYWOOD product should do.<br /><br />I have to tell you that I'm clausterphobic and this movie really got to me. I truly felt like I was in that small cramped space with them. I felt the building fall down. I felt the urgency, the fear, the sadness. I wasn't in NY on 9/11, but boy I sure felt like I was while watching this movie.<br /><br />And like another person said, if we watched this movie and \\"Flight 93\\" every day, maybe we'd remember who the real enemy is.
B000NA77YO|5.0|When it first happened 15 years ago for Dehumanizer, I didn't think much of Dio's return but as a ploy to revive a drop in sabbath and Dio album sales. It did produce a great album now in retrospective with some years to digest.  Also, we all longed for the reunion of Ozzy and Sabbath at that time. Well, 15 years later, the big reunion has come and gone, and now Heaven and Hell (thanks Sharron Osbourne)...And I am completely Stoked.  The Three new songs on here are some of the best work Iommi and Dio have made in years, and argue they Are better than the 2 Ozzy put on the Reunion release.   It's a shame they didn't go through with Releasing the box set idea for the Dio years as originally planned, but fans can rejoyce because they get three great new song, the devil cried, Shadow of the wind, and Ear in the wall, for a cheaper price than likely a box set would have cost.  I can't wait until Heaven and Hell tour, and the subsequent Live CD that is planned to be released this fall as well. In the future, I can only hope for a complete greatest hits disc to include the years following Ozzy and Dio...Tony Martin was a great frontman for 5 albums and a live Cd, and the man deserves credit as well. And who can forget \\"Deep Sabbath\\" with Ian Gillen as frontman for the Born again album, classic.  I do agree, some songs did not make this like sign of the southern cross and Time machine, which is why the box set or two CD set may have been better, but I'll take what I can get.  So if this is a sign of things to come...BRING IT ON.  MUST BUY FOR THE METAL HEADS.

B000K7UBTI|3.0|I was excited to see this film, but it sucked the happy right out of me. A achingly-slow story coupled with weak cliched characters, plus jumps in logic too hackneyed even for animation, render this crud a quick trip to nap-ville. (At least I enjoyed an unplanned sleepy time about 3/4 into \\"Iron Man\\".) The CGI reminded me of the old anime \\"Lensman\\": used mostly without flair, and totally lifeless compared to the regular animation.<br /><br />If you must have this dud, wait until it shows up eventually in the $5.50 bin, alongside those other mishaps, the Ultimate Avengers films. Tony Stark's pencil mustache should be cause enough to stay away.

B000MV9026|4.0|Life in the Antarctic is tough.  The weather is usually too chilly for golf.  It is tough to build a fire because there are no trees and thus no wood.  There are no fast food restaurants for a long way.  Then there are the leopard seals.<br /><br />Mumble (voiced by Elijah \\"Frodo Baggins\\" Wood) is hatched to Norma Jean (voice of Nicole Kidman) and Memphis (voice of Hugh Jackman) during a period when female penguins are off fishing.  Life might have been different if Memphis, in a rash moment, had not dropped his egg.<br /><br />As it turns out, penguins are quite musical, at least in this movie they are.  Unfortunately, Mumble is unable to sing.  However, Mumble can dance like Fred Astaire and Bill Robinson and anyone else you can name all put together.  Of course, few penguins are enthused about changing the status quo.  Singing is a good thing, and dancing is strictly forbidden.  After having a rough childhood and having a crush on Gloria (voiced by Brittany Murphy), Mumble is off on his own.<br /><br />Other penguins have other standards and Mumble's ability to dance is an instant hit with the penguins on the other side of the glacier.  Mumble only makes one mistake, and that is to, once again, challenge the status quo when he points out that Barry White impersonator Lovelace (Robin Williams) is a fraud.<br /><br />Poor Mumble is an outcast from just about everywhere, so he decides it is time to track down the aliens that have been chasing away all the fish.  The aliens find Mumble and put him into a strange place where there is a lot of food and a very bizarre environment.  Mumble manages to run into a couple of walls before he realizes that he is not in the Antarctic any more.  Lucky for Mumble the aliens appreciate a good dancer, even if he is dressed in a penguin suit, and the aliens permit Mumble to return to Antarctica, with an electronic decoration.<br /><br />The leaders of the penguins greet Mumble's return with disdain until the aliens show up, and suddenly penguins are line dancing all over the place with abandon.<br /><br />This movie is alternately cute and absurd.  This movie contains a number of positive messages about being different and acceptance.  Much of the movie is accurate regarding the behavior of penguins as they care for their eggs and how they deal with the long Antarctic night.  Much of the movie is funny and is just like the cartoon I expected.  On the flip side, penguins are not intelligent aliens and communicating with dance moves instead of tones (thinking of \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\") was just a bit bizarre.  I think the environmental message of this film would have been just as effective with cutesy cartoonish penguins as opposed to tap dancing line dancing penguins.<br /><br />I do not recommend this movie for young children for several reasons.  First is the scene with the skuas.  These predatory birds do attack and eat baby penguins in a gory way.  Second, leopard seals eat just about anything they can catch, including penguins.  Antarctic researchers also avoid leopard seals.  Third, how do you explain why Mumble was eating a bloody chunk of fish (that's not Nemo, it is just sushi, children)?  I can see younger children having nightmares after this movie.  I have yet to mention the numerous adult references, but added together, you can see that this animated film is not for young children.<br /><br />I was surprised to learn that this movie is controversial because of its environmental message.  The movie is reasonably accurate regarding environmental issues and I think children need exposure to this kind of information so that they have an opportunity to help save our planet.  The Lord knows we have managed to do a pretty poor job of that to this point.  However, that exposure needs to be limited to older children because this movie is not for younger children who will have problems with some of the messages in this film.<br /><br />Good Luck!, and suddenly penguins are line dancing all over the place with abandon. <br /> <br />This movie is alternately cute and absurd.

B000FVNX2Q|4.0|The HP12C is as emblematic of financial calculators as the zippo is to cigarette lighters. It is a sort of \\"ultimate machine\\" in its class. It is small, handy, robust, and it has ridiculously long battery life. Quite simply, you cannot buy a better calculator for finance than the HP12C. If you can't find an unused older \\"made in USA\\" HP12C, this is the best one you can own. In some ways, it is arguably the best one to own, as it has some improved features over the original HP12C (a version of which is also still made, believe it or not: that's how good these things are -though the modern Chinese version is inferior in construction to the old American and Brazilian versions). I'm docking it a star (it should be more like a half star) as the old versions were somewhat better made, and because the new version could have far more features without detracting from utility or functionality. For example: I'd rather have a numeric integrator and matrix math like in the old HP15C, than algebraic notation. Algebraic notation is only useful for loaning the thing to your friends, which is not something you will want to do. Also included in my one star off is the case, which is almost completely useless. It is giant! And it has a magnet in it, which could destroy your credit cards if they are rattling around in the same bag as your calculator. I do use the case, but only to let it rattle around in my briefcase with other junk; otherwise, if it had the old leather glove style case, it would go in a shirt pocket (though it also could be used to rattle around anywhere, without taking up so much space or having a magnet in it).<br /><br />It is important that anyone looking to buy a 12C establish its provenance; the platinums came in three versions. The first version was garbage. The second was acceptable. The third, the platinum anniversary, is the best of the lot thus far, excepting the case.<br /><br />The book is excellent as well; I've seen it touted as a useful tutorial into accounting theory in quantitative finance forums. You will probably need to read the book if you have not used an HP calculator in RPN before.<br /><br />Who should buy one? Anyone who deals with finance on any level needs one of these. The legend goes, you can get 50 basis points off your loan just for showing up with this calculator.counting theory in quantitative finance forums.

B000LXH0AE|5.0|This movie was released amid the December Oscar glut and sadly didn't receive the audience it deserves.  It is a gem well worth seeing. <br />Although most of Will Ferrell's efforts are over-the-top comedic, here he plays it straight.  That's not to say that \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" doesn't include humor, but it's more warm smiles and tender moments than guffaws.  Farrell's efforts are outstanding as are those of his supporting cast, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Emma Thompson, and Dustin Hoffman with Queen Latifah adding a small but perfectly pitched supporting note.  <br />Ferrell plays Harold Crick, an IRS auditor, the subject of a narration only he can hear.  It seems he's the main character of a book that unfortunately appears to be headed toward tragedy.  Harold is moved to reexamine his life and the results are magic. <br />Director Marc Forster (\\"Finding Neverland\\", \\"Monster's Ball\\") excels once again; \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" is movie making at its best!  Highest recommendation.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|I had heard about this movie and how it was supposed to be a classic. How it had inspired other great directors such as George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. Nevertheless I was not prepared for the experience. I saw this film and then I saw it again and again.  I am not speaking figuratively.  I actually saw this 3 1/2 hour movie 3 times. Back to back.  It's that good.  I still don't believe it was shot in the 1950's as it puts most of today's \\"action\\" movies to shame.  But this is not really an action movie.  It's not really a Japanese film, a samurai film, or a classic.  This is a masterpiece in any medium.

B000EJ9MTW|2.0|While I don't think there is a band quite like them out right now, I feel that Wolfmother could've exploded onto the scene if they would've actually been a band about what they were rumored to be.  Supposedly a cross between sludgy classic rock and grunge, Wolfmother slightly disappoints when a majority of their songs fall under the \\"Pop\\" category of music today.<br /><br />Aside from just a couple of songs, the majority of the album is just a plain rockin' out album from start to finish.  Nothing too complicated, and pretty simple.  Kind of what you'll hear on the radio today from today's Top 40.  Influenced by the greats like Sabbath, Purple, Soundgarden and others, Wolfmother strays away from the downtuned guitars and long strung out chords and keeps the song beats at a high tempo while never allowing themselves to get, well....psychadelic.  Something that hurts the band from further standing out from the crowd.  Perhaps a sophomore effort from these lads will appease the old schoolers a bit more and finally bring back the real rock to the mainstream.
B000N3ST7A|4.0|\\"Leather and Lace\\" is worth the price, IMHO, but there's too much missing.  \\"Gypsy\\" for a start, I'd like to see the CD as a Vol 1 with a second volume that's including more of her solo work and maybe some tunes with other artists in duets.   <br /> <br />There was definitely waaay too much good music left out to reprise \\"Edge of Seventeen\\" at the end.  I realize these are two totally different renditions, but leaving one out would have allowed another song on.   <br /> <br />I especially would love to see some of the Buckingham Nicks CD, which was Stevie's first work with Lindsay Buckingham, released.  \\"Frozen Love\\" and \\"Crying in the Night\\" are too good to fade into obscurity.

The guy who played the nut who thought Gardner had a time machine was good.<br /><br />The Pursuit of Happyness is good for renting and watching once or twice.

B0004Z33F0|5.0|I watched the first two Rambo movies prior to the release of this one.  Actually, this one sounded very interesting, but I did not watch it until now.  One reviewer pointed out this was considered the weakest of the three; why is it the weakest is also the most enjoyable (as said reveiwer also seemed to agree).<br /><br />One reviewer mentioned the boy was one reason this movie was not as successful, and gave other examples, though failing to mention Aliens (maybe because that was an exception).  Actually, it helped.  So did the relationship between Rambo and Trautman.  I also thought the scene of Rambo riding underneath the tank to avoid the searchlight was original and creative.<br /><br />The edition I saw had a documentary on a myth of an American hero.  They commented that Rambo was one of four characters in print that made the cross to being heroes on the big screen:  the others were Sherlock Holmes, Tarzan, and James Bond (since then, you can add Harry Potter to the mix.)  The one comment I'll make is that Rambo is unique in the mix, because his character did not survive the original novel.<br /><br />I found this movie enjoyable.  Too violent for some people, two examples of unnecessary cussing (all cussing is unnecessary, by the way), and at times it was unbelievable.  It is interesting seeing this pre 9/11 movie from a post 9/11 persptective.  This was a great picture.
6305922756|5.0|Ever since first seeing \\"This is Spinal Tap\\" in the theater when it was released, this has been my favorite movie. I have no idea how many times I have seen this film, but every viewing makes me love it more. This is the film that brought the phrase \\"mocumentary\\" into common use, and while there are many imitators, there is nothing that can rival \\"Tap\\" in the comedy, satire, or faux-documentary genres.<br /><br />The film is hosted by director Marti DeBergi, played to perfection by Rob Reiner, and follows the career of the legendary rock group \\"Spinal Tap\\" as they come apart at the seams during their \\"Smell the Glove\\" tour. The core of the band are David St. Hubbins (\\"he was the Patron Saint of Quality Footwear\\" and is played by Michael McKean,) Nigel Tufnel (who plays his lead guitar with a violin and is played by Christopher Guest,) and Derek Smalls (who is taunted by a cucumber and an onstage pod, and is played by Harry Shearer.) These three along with Reiner wrote the songs for the film, and, yes, Tap does play their own instruments.<br /><br />The film skewers every part of the pop music business through wonderful period flashbacks and hysterical situations that unfold during the course of the tour. The tour is a disaster, ranging from a Stonehenge triptych that is \\"in danger of being crushed by a dwarf,\\" the perpetual loss of drummers (\\"he died in a bizarre gardening accident,\\" \\"he choked on vomit...someone else's vomit actually...there's no real way to dust for vomit...,\\") to the resignation of the band's longtime manager Ian Faith (wonderfully played by Tony Hendra) with managerial duties being picked up by David's loathsome girlfriend Jeanine Pettibone, who \\"dresses like an Australian's nightmare.\\" The film also features great cameos from luminaries such as Billy Crystal (\\"mime is money,\\") Bruno Kirby (\\"Spinal Pap,\\") and Howard Hesseman as rock star Duke Fame (\\"I'd love to stay and talk, but I have to go sit in the lobby and wait for the limo.\\")<br /><br />The plot thickens when things unravel at a gig on an Air Force base, and \\"Spinal Tap, Mark II\\" briefly appears in a free-form jazz odyssey at an amusement park (\\"Derek Smalls on bass...he wrote this...\\"): the marquee reads \\"Puppet Show and Spinal Tap\\"...but at least their dressing rooms are bigger than the puppet's. An eventual tour of Japan resolves a number of plot loose ends, although they do lose another drummer in a mysterious green explosion.<br /><br />In sum: this is the perfect movie. It became my favorite the first time I saw it on the big screen, and through many, many subsequent viewings it has managed to retain that status. If you enjoy sly and satirical humor, this movie is not to be missed, but be forewarned: you will not absorb all the jokes the first time, so mentally prepare yourself for the repeat viewings that will surely follow.> <br />The plot thickens when things unravel at a gig on an Air Force base, and \\"Spinal Tap, Mark II\\" briefly appears in a free-form jazz odyssey at an amusement park (\\"Derek Smalls on bass...he wrote this...\\"): the marquee reads \\"Puppet Show and Spinal Tap\\"...but at least their dressing rooms are bigger than the puppet's.

0743454537|4.0|At the begining of the school year I joined my school's book club. Being a non stop reader I couldn't wait to get the first book of the school year. The first book was My Sister's Keeper and I was slightly hesitant about reading it because the title was odd and I was guessing about what it might be about(and having no luck). Anyways I read it because I had to for book club and I had nothing else to do. When I first picked it up I had a hard time remembering names and getting the story lines straight but when I did I becase engrossed in the story and the importance of it's meaning. It wasn't just a book anymore when I relised what it was about it became sort of the tribute to anyone that was tired of being used. While I was reading this book I found my self thinking about moral issues walking from class to class and from the bus stop to home. It really opened this new idea to me that everything we do isnt moral no matter how hard we try. Rationality is discarded when loved ones are involved and sometimes to save someone we sacrfice someone innocent. Anyway you look at My Sister's Keeper someone was sacrficed maybe at that time for the greater good but in the end it just lead to wounds that would never heal. <br /> <br /> <br />This book gets a four because I loved the plot twists and the meaning behind the words that were written on the pages. Not everyone can make a girls struggle so real than take it away in such a real way you can feel it. I give a lot of credit to Jodi Picoult for doing that and still making it real. But thats the down fall of this book the ending. It ended so wrong yet so right that feels like someone punched you in the gut than helped you back up, telling you it was for your own good. This book in a way humbled me. It might just do that for you too. <br />
B000N4SHPS|4.0|It was better than I thought.  Yes I wish it ended in a knock out and the end happened so fast.  Like Rocky was leaving really fast just after the last few punches.  It seemed odd.  Of all the things I would have loved it if the other boxers showed up to help him train.  If Dolf showed up in the shadows and told him his posture was off and how he could not guard his face.  Also if Mr. T was there.  I was really hoping for that. ;(

The funniest part of the movie was the end!!! That little girl is hilarious. Please go see the movie. Definately worth it.
B00005JPME|4.0|This film revolves around a world class sniper, who is as always, retired from the military and living in a cabin in the hills.  He is contacted by an agent of the US government and asked to assist in protecting the president from an assassination; though when the attempt is, he is framed and runs.  This follows all the major guidelines of the genre: shot and wounded, the hero will find shelter with a the girl; he will also make a sympathetic contact inside the government.  But he also makes a bang which is worth the buck. <br /> <br />The story line is nothing new.  It could have been created by rearranging the plots of one or two other political thrillers.  But the characters are solid; I particularly enjoyed the unique female character who killed a deserving character in cold blood; this is very non-stereo typical.  The action was quite often held up to the strength of the old Rambo films.  Though at times film makers did demonstrate a sad lack technical and tactical expertise, they compensated amply though with big explosions and quite believable, very enjoyable action sequences.  The political intrigue was interesting particularly for all the insults made about actual US politics.  Other than that the film had nothing significant; actually not even a love scene. <br /> <br />I would recommend saying this film on the big screen.  I did; and it was worth my $6.50; I'm probably not going to buy on DVD though. I would recommend you rent it, if you can't see it on the big screen; then buy: [[ASIN:B0004Z33G4 The Rambo Trilogy - The Ultimate Collection]]. <br />
0307237699|3.0|I was so excited to read this book, but it couldn't really hold my interest.  It says a lot without saying much, I must confess.  I agree with Senator Obama that we all want the same things, but I want more exact ideas on how to get there, outlined step-by-step.  That said, his style is easy to read and positive.  It just isn't a style that draws me in, literarily-speaking.
B000001DYA|4.0|It was instructive to be a 17 year old boy when first encountering this artyfact in the time of its release. Free from pre-conception (save experiencing the AM Single \\"Summertime Blues\\"), I was quite astonished and happy to have found \\"something entirely different\\" in my musical life. Friends dismissed this hunk of tribal neolithic vinyl as imitative of the Who (themselves cover artists of Summertime Blues), Jimi Hendrix, Cream and others, but for myself - I heard none of that.<br /><br />What I DID hear was the volcanic, anarchic chaos that I struggled to enunciate myself.  Sure, I could tell that this wasn't \\"music the way its usually made\\". It wasn't \\"pretty\\" and it wasn't \\"artistic\\", but damn, it sure did blow the door off. And, it was music to be shouted and bludgeoned, rather than merely to be sang and played cleverly. In short, I could really \\"get into\\" this.  And what I didn't know was these guys were approximately my age when they conceived and recorded these epic monstrosities.  They were \\"relating\\" to me, to phrase it in the psycho-babble of a slightly later time.<br /><br />What did I hear on this Philips Long Player? Unbridled lust for life and youth in the process of exploding in an extra-cultural fashion.<br /><br />I have to say, a very few of my friends, other than the legions of Blue Cheer critics, came out where I did on this:  \\"This **** is great!\\" And, to tell you the truth, I have never tired of Vincebus and its crazed, demented follow-up: Outsideinside. I bought and wore them out in vinyl, in cassette and CD. I still listen to them with a dazed look on my face.<br /><br />And a word of caution, 99% of those who hear this say \\"This is terrible!\\" or just merely clear out of the area.

B000002GKT|5.0|I'm listening to this album (that's what we used to call 'em, albums)and reading these reviews warmed by memory. Back in the day, every time we listened to this mainstay of a record, my friend Joe would have to remind us that his buddy was at the Fillmore that night, one of those \\"people behind the glass plate at the back of the hall.\\" If you asked 100 people on the street today if they ever heard of Humble Pie, 98 would be clueless and the 2 that had would be over 45 years old. Nevertheless kids, every review that calls this one of the \\"greatest live rock albums of all time\\" (which appears to be every review) is 110% on the money. It's right there with \\"Live at Leeds\\" or anything you else you care to drag up. I've never been a huge fan of Humble Pie's studio records, probably because I became most familiar with \\"Live\\" first. The studio stuff's OK, but if you're a rock fan this MUST be in your collection. You don't need to know the band or the songs, if you're 18 or 80 and you love 70's era rock music, you will love this record. It's loud, long, raw and absolutely relentless. Folks, spend your hard earned money wisely. Don't buy junk. Buy this.

B0002Y4TZG|5.0|New so-called punk bands like Good Charlotte or AFI or even older bands like Blink 182 or the Offspring never felt like real punk to me. Maybe it was just that it was too many generations after the Dolls and the Ramones and the Pistols. The template is now set, and the fashion element is too important, and most importantly, absolutely nobody is shocked any more. Punk has become just another marketing label, and an acceptable one at that. The days of bands seeming like they were going to change the world ended sometime around 1979.<br /><br />That was the year that the Clash released LONDON CALLING, which remains, to these subjective ears, the single greatest rock album ever recorded: Two slabs of vinyl featuring 19 songs pulling influences from rockabilly, reggae, blues, funk, jazz and pop with not one single clunker in the bunch. It was politically relevant, socially charged and so vital that I got a shock every time I put it on the turntable.<br /><br />In the years since its release, its urgency has barely lessened. Regardless of the frat boys who only know the line \\"I live by the river!\\" from the title track or radio listeners who misstate the chorus of \\"Train in Vain\\" as \\"You CAN stand by me\\" instead of \\"you DIDN'T stand by me,\\" LONDON CALLING still feels new and exciting and rebellious and powerful.<br /><br />And so, Sony Legacy has released LONDON CALLING: THE 25th ANNIVERSARY LEGACY EDITION, combining the original album (as remastered for the 1999 re-release) with a bonus DVD and a CD of the so-called \\"Vanilla Tapes,\\" previously unheard rehearsal sessions featuring five songs that didn't make the record.<br /><br />For the Clash fanatic (uh, me), The Vanilla Tapes are an archaeological find akin to unearthing Da Vinci's sketchbooks or Sylvia Plath's practice suicide notes. To hear the genesis of an album that I know inside out is a privilege. But I can't imagine that even the biggest Clash fan is going to pull The Vanilla Tapes out on a regular basis. Of the 21 songs, only about a half a dozen hold up as more than historical artifacts (even aside from the poor sound quality). After listening to The Vanilla Tapes about six times, I already have a number of tracks that get the skip button... A long, repetitive instrumental demo of \\"Hateful\\" only serves to hammer home the monotony of rock and roll song structure. Anyone who's only a casual fan of the band probably isn't even going to make it through the whole disc once. Even the \\"new\\" songs aren't fully fleshed out enough to be really considered full songs (although many will be intrigued by the band's cover of Bob Dylan's \\"The Man in Me\\"). \\"Heart and Mind\\" seems like it may have been nixed by the band because it sounds too much like an outtake from the band's second LP, GIVE `EM ENOUGH ROPE (the closest they ever came to a misstep).<br /><br />The DVD features a new half hour documentary by Don Letts, THE LAST TESTAMENT: THE MAKING OF LONDON CALLING which is partly a cheat in that it recycles interviews with the band from Letts' WESTWAY TO THE WORLD film from 2001. The new material features the band's old pal Kosmo Vinyl (humorously dubbed their \\"consiglieri\\") and engineer Bill Price. What makes this NOT a rip off is the absolutely mesmerizing footage of the band in the studio, recording the album with producer Guy Stevens.<br /><br />In many studio situations, the producer serves as the leveling force among sometimes volatile band relationships. Not so on the LONDON CALLING sessions. Stevens was a madman; he would throw chairs and ladders around the studio, jump up and down, scream and yell ALL WHILE THE BAND WAS RECORDING! Watching this bearded, crazed Brit trying to destroy plastic chairs while Paul Simonon plays his bass in his natty new shirt and hat is a bizarre juxtaposition that only enhances the mosaic nature of the record. It makes sense.<br /><br />The DVD also features videos for three songs from LONDON CALLING, and more of that amazing studio footage. The set as a whole features two booklets, one brand new with previously unpublished photos by Pennie Smith, two essays and reprints from the Armagideon Times zine the band made for the tour, the other a reprint of the lyric sheet from the record.<br /><br />The Clash were one of those rare rock and roll alchemies that transmuted riffs and anger into poetry and power. LONDON CALLING is the document of the band at its peak, before the inevitable power struggles and changing interests would pull Joe Strummer, Mick Jones, Paul Simonon and Topper Headon apart. They still had two great albums in them (yes, both SANDINISTA! and COMBAT ROCK are GREAT), but it seems almost fitting that punk peaked before the awful decade that was the 80s came to be. For we aging punk fans who saw the band when they were together, who bought their albums when they were new, who knew that \\"the only band that matters\\" wasn't a hollow claim...

B000244FDW|4.0|Very true to the story as written by Austen.  Not as blatantly melodramatic as the 2006 version with Keira Knightley, and more true to custom and fashion than the 2006 and 1940 versions. If only they had paid more attention to the changing color of Elizabeth Bennet's hair....a major distraction that leaves one wondering who she is in a few scenes.
B00005JLEU|5.0|One of Hayao Miyazaki's newest movies, Spirited Away is one of his most engrossing movies. It features a whiny, bratty, and generally dislikable girl named Chihiro. While she and her parents are traveling to their new home, they take the wrong turn and end up faced by a large underpass of sorts, which seems old and decrepit. However, Chihiro's boisterous father insists on barging through the tunnel to the other side. This other side turns out to be a road lined with countless restaurants! Her parents start pigging out at one, and the next time Chihiro looks, Dad and Mom ARE pigs!  <br /> <br />This is the beginning of a very, very creative story. Chihiro finds herself in a world of incredibly strange creatures and ends up working at a bathhouse for said creatures. Miyazaki obviously takes inspiration from the traditional Japanese religion of Shinto-ism--at one point we encounter a river spirit--and due to this creates a story quite unlike anything American. <br /> <br />However, it can get a slightly creepy tone at times. The No-Face creature, which seems to take on the personality of anyone he swallows, ends up running around the bathhouse giving chunks of gold to whoever serves him food. The workers of the bathhouse practically swarm him, yelling with greed and scooping up the gold he scatters. No-Face himself is a rippling hunk of ebony with a white mask for a face and a large gaping mouth directly underneath this emotionless mask. This creates a slightly disturbing visage. <br /> <br />All in all, I wouldn't recommend this for children under 12, but for everyone else it's quite enjoyable. We see Chihiro change from a brat to a confident young woman and this, added to the circumstances which cause such changes in her personality, makes Spirited Away a great adventure.
0061122416|1.0|I read this book on the advice of a friend, and I have to say I found it horrible.  After every section I kept thinking it HAD to get better.  Some one saw me reading, and when I said I was having trouble getting into it told me it gets better.  IT DOESN'T.    There are so many books out there that actually ARE inspirational I can't see how this one is on the top of the list for some people.  Truly, it is written as if some one did it as a long jr, high school project.  There is absolutley no depth to the plot or the characters.    Please - read something else and ignore the hype.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|For the past few years, I've seen several of Hayao Miyazaki's movies. All of them are wonderful in their own way. However, even though it's 22 years old now, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind shines as one of his best movies ever.  <br /> <br />The plot is simple: a story about a girl, Princess Nausicaa of The Valley of the Wind. This minute, windmill-filled town is one of few places on Earth untouched by the Toxic Jungle. Due to horrible wars and tragedies among the human race, most of the Earth is covered by a mutated, poisonous forest that no human can survive in without a breath mask. To make things worse, enormous insects called Ohm live in this worldwide jungle--when someone disturbs the Ohm, everyone pays for it.  <br /> <br />However, Nausicaa does not hate and fear the Ohm like the rest of humankind does. She is a sort of 'Doctor Dolittle'--someone who loves and understands all animal and insect life. She dares to venture out to the Toxic Jungle, exploring its nooks and crannies. <br /> <br />But the remnants of past conflicts still remain hidden on the Earth. Several gigantic creatures, doomsday machines of sorts, were put into hibernation at the end of the last war. Now, power-hungry kingdoms, still untouched by the Toxic Jungle, lust after those creatures and begin planning to awaken one, intending to use it for domination of the world. Nausicaa becomes irrevocably involved in this drama. <br /> <br />This story is classic to anime--incredibly convoluted and filled with commentary on humankind's mistakes. It remains a perfect fantasy that can be enjoyed and understood by everyone.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is one of those series that makes you dissapointed in mass America and the corporate buisness world. It was too intelligent for the majority of people that watch television and therefore did not last as a television series. It has all the aspects of a great story - lovable characters, ongoing suspense, action, adventure, romance, etc. A Western set in outerspace showing that in our future we find no aliens, but grow so big that we have to inhabit other worlds and our own worst enemies are ourselves. Was glad that they made [[ASIN:B000FA57N0 Serenity [HD DVD]]]after all, to answer all our questions.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|Porco Rosso: a man with the head of a pig who's an ace pilot. When I first read the synopsis of this movie, I was slightly befuddled. But when I actually saw it, for some strange reason I found it one of the more charming Miyazaki movies! Maybe it's because Porco Rosso's former girlfriend looks and acts like a starlet from those 1940's movies I love to watch. Who knows? But this definitely isn't a weak attempt at levity by Miyazaki. Porco Rosso is consumed by guilt from an old secret he's been hiding since World War One. And when he meets a young girl who's a talented engineer, that secret will be revealed.  <br /> <br />This movie shows Miyazaki's love of all mechanical things that fly, and also his love of creative fantasy. It's a wonderful adventure.
0441009425|4.0|Reynolds' imagination is second to none.  Every page offers a new idea, many of which are easily missed because Reynolds assumes a lot of intelligence on the readers part.  Reynolds does not like to explain every detail of his ideas and leaves it to the reader to fill in the gaps or sometimes his ideas are fleshed out farther in the novel. The novel almost has a feel of being written from a alien mind or a human mind that is different from the way our minds work.  I don't know if this was deliberate or a product of his imagination.      My only real problem with the novel is the two dimensional feel of the characters, not because there is not a lot of time spent on the characters, because there is.  The characters are written in a way that is alien to our contemporary understanding.  Even attempts to make some of the characters more understandable or sympathetic fall short.      Revelation Space is a worthy read just because of all the imaginative thought but will make you work for it.
B0006J28BO|5.0|The Cat Returns is the sequel for the slow-moving Whisper of the Heart. The link between these two stories is the nattily dressed cat called The Baron. However, this story is much different than the one of Whisper of the Heart. <br /> <br />Haru is the girl in this story. She's a clumsy, stressed-out geek, and basically pitiable. But one day she sees a cat that's about to get hit by a car, and saves him. To her shock, he stands up on two paws, brushes himself off, and then politely bows, thanks her, and leaves!  <br /> <br />This is the beginning of Haru's adventure. In the next few days she's showered with mice, cattails, catnip, and even an offer of marriage! In the end she has to confront the King of the Cat Kingdom to get her life back to normal.  <br /> <br />The extent of the story is dotted with comedy and lightheartedness. Haru grows up tremendously over the course of time, and in the end we see a girl who's much happier with her life. This is a very enjoyable movie and, regretfully, I liked it much better than Whisper of the Heart. <br /> <br />(I have to say that Peter Boyle did a great job as Muta the irascible, portly cat. He brought the character to life perfectly. Sometimes Muta really makes the movie!)
B000AARKOO|5.0|One could review Kingdom of Heaven on a lot of levels ... as an action packed medieval adventure/romance ... as a vehicle for some of your favorite actors ... or as a statement about humanity's less than perfect attempts to find spiritual meaning in life in a way that doesn't lead to warfare with people of differing points of view.  I was expecting mostly the first two ... and was pleasantly surprised to find a reasonable amount of the third.  My favorite quote from the movie summed up a powerful feeling I've had about spirituality for some time now:<br /><br />\\"God will understand, my lord. And if he doesn't, then he is not God and we need not worry.\\"<br /><br />Why people so infrequently ask themselves whether the god they believe in really makes sense to their hearts or not, I don't know.  And when I heard these words coming from the screen, I realized \\"someone out there understands ... we don't find God in books or doctrine or sermons ... we know God in our hearts, or not at all\\".  This character looked to his heart and knew ... God will understand ... and anyone who doesn't is surely not God, no matter what someone else might claim.<br /><br />And if you loved the movie, you'll enjoy this DVD ... it's a classy widescreen handling of a film that's visually rich and deserves to be seen in it's cinematic format. With gorgeous scenery and delightful characters and costuming, I can't imagine watching such a visually appealing film in less than wide screen form.
B0000021RL|3.0|After a couple of laid back recordings Chicago attempts something different.  This recording starts out promisingly with some instrumental tracks \\"Prelude to Aire\\", \\"Aire\\", \\"Devil's Sweet\\", \\"Italian From New York\\", interesting because it was so un-Chicago-like with the absence of vocals. The horns and superb drumming were there. Robert Lamm began his experimentation with synthesizers.  These are not earth shattering innovative works but to my ears they largely work and shows some re-assessment on the group's part.<br /><br />\\"Wishing You Were Here\\" is quite good and also a very different kind of song for Chicago.  The Beach Boy's presence really added something special.<br /><br />\\"Women Don't Want to Love Me\\" is a also a good solid pop piece with clever hooks and a sense of fun.<br /><br />\\"Skinny Boy\\" was more a Robert Lamm vehicle but still works and also fun to listen to.<br /><br />The rest of this recording leaves me cold.  First of all, Peter Cetera is now singing almost exclusively in cloyingly annoying falsetto instead in his normal stronger tenor.  Pieces like \\"Happy Man\\", \\"Call On Me\\" and \\"I've Been Searching So Long\\", while well arranged and nicely constructed are just too schmaltzy.  What happened to the dynamic unit that shone so brightly on the first three recordings?  Now, I know that the music scene changes and you can't go about attempting to replicate an album or formula, especially if you intend to be a force and have longevity, but still I just know they could do much better than these last songs I mentioned.  Here you had a dynamic horn section, one of the best and most underrated drummers out there.  You had an incredible guitarist that were all under utilized in the lesser portions of this recording.<br /><br />Still this recording had enough high points to merit three stars for me.
B00009W0U4|4.0|*** This comment may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />The plot of the film is simple: a woman (Monica Belucci) is brutally raped by a stranger; and her boyfriend (Vincent Cassel) and ex-boyfriend (Albert Dupontel) who are best friends set out for revenge. What is crucial, the story is told backward.<br /><br />The most obvious success for this film is the directing by Noe. He has crafted a nightmare that is both original and horrifying. If the inferno exists somewhere, one of its circles definitely looks like the \\"The Rectum\\" bar, and the other - like the underpass where Alex (Monica Belucci) was brutally sodomized and beaten for long nine minutes that seemed as an eternity. The pulsing score that accompanies the film contains, for the first sixty minutes, a constant 27-hertz tone specifically designed by No&eacute; to cause nausea in the audience. It felt like someone was constantly drilling the holes in my head. The director creates the scenes of such pain and violence that makes \\"Natural Born Killers\\" look and feel like a puppet show. One of these is a scene where a man gets his head bashed in with a fire extinguisher with the camera never turned away and the sound is amplified.<br /><br />The movie shocks you, and then it goes and shocks you even more when there is no violence on the screen. I broke in tears during the bedroom scene - so much love, tenderness and desire Monica and Vincent had for each other. They did not know what was ahead; I did.<br /><br />In the end, one cannot help questioning the very fragile, illusory nature of happiness, how easy it is to destroy everything. Is it a blessing or curse not to know what lies ahead and not be able to change the future?<br /><br />Dostoevsky said almost hundred and fifty years ago that the Beauty will save the world. I don't know. Not this world. Not during my time.<br /><br />\\"Irreversible\\" is a shocking anti-violence film; one has to decide whether he or she wants to see it. I personally think it is a must see but I would not be surprised if a lot of viewers refuse.nk it is a must see but I would not be surprised if a lot of viewers refuse.  <br />
B000E1MTY0|5.0|Read the synopsis for the story line. As for the HD DVD, \\"Batman Begins\\" delivers outstanding video and audio quality, as well as plenty of behind-the-scenes extras.<br /><br />Christian Bale makes an ideal Batman, as Michael Caine makes an excellent Alfred...come to think of it, there isn't a miscast role in this entire film! The great performances combined with the creative and original story elements all add highly to the watchability of this cinematic masterpiece.<br /><br />For fans not only of Batman, but also of great movies in general, I highly recommend this film!
B000MXPE7O|4.0|I was drawn into the movie, a story well told, but......If you want to know what really happened at the Bay of Pigs read Donald Kagan's 'On the Origins of War.'  Eisenhower set a plan in motion to take Cuba back from Castro, but JFK balked at the last moment, failing to send enough troops or air support,  even though his military advisors implored him to do so. He lacked the will because he was afraid if we invaded Cuba more 'robustly' Khrushchev would respond by making a move for the western half of Berlin, and from there we'd be obligated to respond; Perhaps with an ICBM.  In truth Khrushchev was baffled that JFK failed to take back Cuba which he referred to as \\"the little sausage shaped island.\\"  Because of JFKs indecisiveness with the Bay of Pigs Khrushchev found the huberis, 6 months later, to put Nukes on the island, which caused the missle crisis...But the crisis was overstated as the Soviets only had 11 ICBMs to our 300 plus, so they weren't about to do an 'exchange'.  Besides which (and this is seldom mentioned) a deal had been cut behind closed doors wherein we agreed to remove missles from Turkey (so the \\"stand-off was all 'sound and fury' signifying nothin) and that's the real dope folks,  but back to the movie.<br />  In one scene they torture a Soviet spy, plying him with LSD (as an aside that qualifies as truth stranger than fiction: The CIA first tested acid in a whorehouse that was their front in San Fran.  The prostitutes gave their johns a tab while the spooks looked on thru one way mirrors in operation midnight climax) Anyhow, The tripping spy says they have nothing to fear from the Soviet Union, that it's just \\"paint over rust\\" and that they know it but they have to keep the appearance of a grave threat to justify and maintain spending for the military industrial complex.  Some food for thought.
B000MTPANQ|4.0|Neil Young is one of the best song writers in the past half century (stricly my opinion). This CD/DVD is a great  experience of a concert before his voice had as many miles on it as it does now. Strong, clear, hitting every note! That the quips between every song can become somewhat annoying, they are pure Neil. The DVD suffers from some hokey montages of Massey Hall, and other topics, where as I would rather have had it just stay on Neil during his singing. Still, buy it! It was in this concert where he first sung his classics from the Harvest Album. This is an important CD if you are a fan, and if you are just a casual listener, you won't be disappointed with the man's voice.

B000LXH0AE|2.0|True enough, STRANGER THAN FICTION is aptly titled. It is the \\"story\\" of an IRS auditor (Will Ferrell) whose fate somehow becomes the fate of the doomed protagonist in an author's (Emma Thompson) newest book. The fact that the auditor, Harold Crick, his shrink (Dustin Hoffman), and even the author, unquestioning believe this silly premise, constructed without any artistic or plot foundation, means only one thing -- yep, they are all INSANE. So, if you think watching characters who should be living in a funny farm is your idea of a night's entertainment, then by all means, get a copy of STRANGER THAN FICTION. Will Farrell walks through his first dramatic role in zombie-like fashion, which is tolerable only because he gets genuine acting support from Thompson, Hoffman and Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays Crick's love interest. Farrell hears voices in his head as did Mel Gispson in WHAT WOMEN WANT. Compare the acting abilities of Gipson and Farrell in these two movies. At least the voices in Gibson's head were \\"explained\\" as being the result of traumatic electrical shock. The bankrupt script writers of STRANGER offer no such explanation for how Crick becomes the author's protagonist. Zip. Zero Nada. If this was (good) fiction, there should be some explanation; instead, it is stranger than fiction.
B0009A137U|5.0|THE BIRDS metaphorically plays out the frailties of the human heart as befuddled humans' fears are visually juxtaposed against hoards of birds gone on a destructive rampage. Humans rebel against nature and each other as the birds represent nature in harmony turned against human progenitors who stand to disrupt harmony. Rod Taylor's solid performance, as the steadfast Mitch Brenner who gradually realizes (but cannot fathom why) that things are beyond even his control, is pivotal to the progression of the story. The importance of Taylor's performance has been long overlooked. This film is a masterpiece full of vivid histrionics running the gamut of human emotions.
0743496728|5.0|It's hard to go wrong with Jodi Picoult's books. Her writing style is fluid and descriptive and metaphors abound! This story is another fascinating book. What makes it so special is that each of the characters is given a full treatment. There aren't any easy answers - the shooter isn't cast as the \\"bad guy\\" and those he shoots aren't all labeled as the \\"good guys\\". Expect a lot of gray areas and room for debate. This is an excellent book club choice - the discussions will be coming fast & furious - no matter what side of the fence you're on!
B000JBWWBK|4.0|I read this book years ago and it has stuck with me, so I was excited to see the preview for this film.  I had to wait until it came out on video because my town's theatres cater to the teenage mainstream (slasher gore, remakes of slasher gore, CGI, hollywood (deliberately NOT capitalized!)formula films, etc.)  <br /> <br />To be honest, the first time through the film did not dazzle but, as with most of Ridley Scott's stuff, you simply have to watch it more than once to really SEE it and get to know the character's stories. In this case love stories - Max's love of money and power; DuFlout's love of the land; a town's love of their way of life; a nephew's love for his uncle; a young woman's love for a man she never met; a man's love for a woman and a place.  <br />The scenery is spectacular, the supporting cast is by turn funny, sincere and slimy, and I think Russell Crowe's charater may start off a bit of a phony and that's how he's playing him. <br /> <br />My husband, who is normally, \\"If this has 'feelings' I'm not watching\\" really liked the story. Yes, it's a bit predictable, and sometimes that's just what I want.  In a world that's so short attention span, Wow I've never seen that before, Gee, that looks almost real- it's nice to find a sweet little love story that shows a place and people we wish we really knew and works out the way we all wish life could. <br /> <br />(I got the soundtrack too.) <br />[[ASIN:B000JBWWBK A Good Year]]
6305308659|4.0|Most of thse reviews explain the plot pretty well... <br /> <br />My only problem with it that keeps it from being perfect for me, is the Actual \\"show\\" called Pleasantville within the movie. It just isnt credible as a show that wouldve merited a marathon or that wouldve had any kind of a believable following. If you actually are familiar with TV shows from that era you see right away that this is a way over the top camped up version of an actual show. with acting so bad that you know this show wouldnt have lasted more than a season... unless it was meant to be bad on purpose and a 50s audience \\"got it\\" as a satire. <br /> <br />It DOES have a\\" Father Knows Best \\" look to it. but the \\" Pleasantville\\" in the opening of this movie should have been taken more seriously in the acting. The 50s werent the beginning of \\"acting\\", these shows had professional actors and as simple and sappy as some of the plotlines might have been. the dialogue was never that bad. and if it were...like I said earlier....It wouldnt have merited a marathon or a following. <br /> <br />Having vented about that...I was VERY happy with the rest of the film!

0783240236|5.0|THE BIRDS metaphorically plays out the frailties of the human heart as befuddled humans' fears are visually juxtaposed against hoards of birds gone on a destructive rampage. Humans rebel against nature and each other as the birds represent nature in harmony turned against human progenitors who stand to disrupt harmony. Rod Taylor's solid performance, as the steadfast Mitch Brenner who gradually realizes (but cannot fathom why) that things are beyond even his control, is pivotal to the progression of the story. The importance of Taylor's performance has been long overlooked. This film is a masterpiece full of vivid histrionics running the gamut of human emotions. Jessica Tandy as Lydia Brenner is a somewhat domineering figure but gradually becomes the epitome of human frailty at its lowest ebb. Tippi Hedren as Melanie Daniels is a somewhat shallow soul searching perhaps for guidance in the person of Mitch Brenner. Suzanne Pleshette as school teacher Annie Hayworth gives a very direct performance as a very young world weary cynical soon-to-be spinster who knows exactly what she wants. However as she has vied for the attentions of Mitch Brenner, her efforts remain fruitless and she is about to face the perils of nature's unknown. In the end all the central characters have lost all their outer strengths and only retain their limited ability to survive be it from their own perseverance or the offering of a loved one.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Yes, most of \\"Meteora's\\" lyrics seem like they were written by an angst-filled teenage girl rebelling against her parents who \\"just don't get her\\".  And no, there is really not much variety in the themes of the songs.  But the CD is still a 5-star listen.  It truly is one of the few CDs I own where I won't skip a single track.  Usually I despise any form of rap / hip hop, but Linkin Park is able to successfully blend it in with their rock music in a way acceptable to even the biggest Young Jeezy haters.  Vastly superior to Hybrid Theory, Meteora is an excellent CD from what has become one of my favorite bands.  Now, if you're into hard metal, this is probably not for you - it seems many of the negative reviews are from Slayer fans who can't stand \\"Nu metal\\".  But really, Linkin Park is not metal - more of a blend of rock and rap, with some funky electronics thrown in courtesy of Mr. Han.   <br /> <br />Overall: highly reccommended, even if you're only a modest Linkin Park fan.  It is definitely their best CD to date.  And there's just some much intensity behind those angsty screams!
B00005JPLU|4.0|Gerald Butler stars a King of Spartans who leads 300 men against Persians that out number them. That's basically all you really need to know about the plot. The movie is just a brutally violent epic battle film mostly. With some villians that look so horribly diseased that they look like creatures. The film is more of a fantasy than Gladiator or Brave Heart. It does have scenes that seem like they came right from both films though. For instance the very end is exactly like the end of Brave Heart and like Gladiator you have those dream like sequences of fields with people walking in them with wind blowing in their hair. Plus they even try a lot to make Gerald Butler look like Russel Crowe.<br /><br />  Still though despite minor rip-offs from other movies this film works great on it's own. It's exciting and super cool and hard to keep your eyes off it even when heads are flying around. Plus even if Butler channels Crowe's performance from Gladiator it's still an impressivle performance. In no other movie with him, have I seen him own the screen the way he does here. So I think it's a shame that most critics that see the film don't even mention him since this is a real break-out performance for him.
B00030590I|2.0|I know it's a movie but it has some ridiculous assertions. <br /> <br />SPOILERS!!! <br /> <br />1) Two ASSASSINS did a FRONTAL assault on the Emperor and was able to hold off his entire army just by twirling their swords. <br />2) When Jet Li's character kills the Emperor's targets, non of the Emperor's men bother to double check that his targets are actually dead. <br />3) No Emperor is stupid enough to give the reward of letting people drink 10 paces from him. <br />4) If the Emperor did give out such a reward, no assassin would be stupid enough to take it up, because if anyone really got that close to the Emperor, it would have turned out to be a decoy. <br />
B000E8QVWY|4.0|Any one of these DOC-U-DRAMAS genres (Ray, Sonny & Cher, Elvis, The Ronnettes, etc) offer a glimpse into a time when we were all listening to what was happening in the world and the music of these artist took us away, brought us back and still take us on a time journey - my favorite scene here was in Sun Records studio, when Cash was told \\"play somethig from YOU - something that people will remember YOU by when your gone\\" and the creative flow poured out of that man and guitar in Folsom Prison Blues. Truly a magic moment! Well worth the watch, sit back and enjoy - the life of the man in black.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This is one of the best American films ever. It stands out as a monument to America's greatest era. It has the most representative American actor of all times, Gary Cooper, and possibly the second best American director ever, Howard Hawks. It's a piece of Americana. It's a religious, patriotic, social, and political film, but above all, it's a masterpiece. Its key moment (truly beautiful) is when York is rummaging about his dilemma between God or Country. Then he finds those illuminating verses: \\"to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's\\". Ask yourself if in 2007 Americans are giving each its due (or rather stealing from them).<br /><br />The film is respectuful to the religious beliefs of people. It portrays the commonsense and hardships of hardworking country folk with no abuse or ridicule; it is emotional and funny; it is realistic and sensitive. It has great trench war scenes, wonderful family gathering scenes, and beautiful settings in the country. Nobody but Hawks (or John Ford) could have risked making this complicated film, and come up with something so perfect. It's embarrassing to think of what could be done today with a story like this one, especially when political, social and religious elements are involved. Hawks handles every thread of the story amazingly.<br /><br />Curiously enough the real Alvin York requested that Cooper play the leading role, and would not accept anyone else (to allow the rights for the story), and he also requested that the girlfriend didn't \\"drink, smoke or swear\\"; and she does a splendid performance too (she was only 16).<br /><br />The extra disc comes with 2 documentaries, one 1/2 hour long, about the story of the real York, and another, some 50 minutes about Cooper's career, and hosted by Clint Eastwood. Pretty good both.<br /><br />The value of the film itself is enough for any classic film collector to rush to get it. But, as I said already, it is also a piece of Americana, worth using as an educational tool in towns that have forgot how truly great America once was.<br /><br />With God & Country you have Gary Cooper.<br />No God & Welfare, you have Michael Moore.truly great America once was.    With God & Country you have Gary Cooper.  No God & Welfare, you have Michael Moore.
0805062971|5.0|I read the book yesterday twice (once before the conclusion and then after) and then the movie today. This book is AMAZING. I expected the book to be all about the fight club, etc, people he met, but it is not. It is a truly unique story, and both the movie and novel are great. If you haven't seen the movie, you probably will be like, \\"uhhh okayyy\\" for the first 100 pages and then you will slowly slowly slowly savor the last 110 pages. You will immediately be thinking about all the points in the book. You will read the novel back and realize the sheer genius of the writing. <br /> <br />One caveat: The novel has a lot of very, erm, interesting parts where a squeamish reader will have to put it down. I definitely did, and I don't get grossed out very easily.
B000BJS4TO|5.0|a great soundtrack to a great movie.  the string solos (violin, cello, etc.) were especially great...too bad they didn't have more wind solos!  but either way, sounds awesome and beautiful melodies.  you can't get tired of this soundtrack
0345479092|4.0|I can't say if the techniques work or not because I got the book when my son was already 7 months.  I wish I got it early and try to see how it works.  In theory though, it sounds very doable and not harsh as the Ferber's method.  So, basically I just read it for my own knowledge and maybe next time when I'll have another baby I'll have a more balanced child.
8466629408|4.0|It started slow, but the initial plodding is definitely worth it.  By the middle of the book I couldn't stop reading.  I would have given it a fifth star if Baldacci hadn't killed off one particular character. <br /> <br />Implausible?  Sure.  So what?  Superman was implausible, too, but that didn't stop me from eagerly parting with my dime every month to keep up with his adventures.   <br /> <br />Politics?  Like that isn't done by other authors?  Agree or disagree, you might think about a few things you haven't paid much attention to before.  Too many reviewers here are saying \\"horrible politics\\" without discussing the pros and cons of the ideas.  I got the feeling that the author had done some pretty intensive background research, and for that I commend him.   <br /> <br />I loved the good guys and hated the bad guys.  Not much gray here, but I was fine with that.  And I thoroughly enjoyed the eccentricities of the Camel Club members.   <br /> <br />So bring on The Collectors! <br /> <br />
B000NA77YO|3.0|Let me state one thing, Heaven & Hell as well as Mob Rules are two true classic metal albums from the early 80's.  I don't think anyone would disagree with that statement.  When the lineup imploded, Dio went on to form the band DIO and the reason that band had such momentum was because everyone wanted to hear what the man would do after Sabbath.  Fast Forward to 1992 and they reunite to bring us Dehumanizer.  Not a bad album but nowhere near the strength of the 2 prior studio albums.  I was very excited about hearing about this DIO Years release, especially the 3 new tracks.  Everyone will argue about what was put on and left off of this from the 3 prior releases, all a matter of your taste and opinion.  For me, I would rather hear Time Machine than After All the Dead and Slipping Away or Sign of the Southern Cross instead of Lonely is The Word.  Most if not all fans own those cds so no real reason to complain.  The 3 New Tracks are what brings this to the counter.  The Devil Cried and Shadow of the Wind both sound as if they were pulled from Dio's Master of The Moon CD, boring and not really exciting.  The songs don't show signs of life, just doom and gloom really.  Not a strong melody nor phrasing.  Dio's voice is still strong, he just seems to lack the conviction that he once had to sell these songs.  The only standout track is Ear In The Wall.  Not a great track but a very good one with some life and energy.  This is the direction the other 2 songs should have went.  I will listen to this a few times but it is no way a reason to add to your collection.  One good song out of the 3 is no reason to buy this unless you have lots of disposable income.  Buy it if you are curious what these tracks sound like but I think you will find that you won't be recommending this to anyone a month from now :(
B00005CDNK|5.0|I first listened to this album back in the 80s when I was a teen, now I bought the remastered version and I am in my 40s and I think this album is excellent! When I was 18 or 20 I didnt realized what a wonderful material it was, and now I cannot believe it. Frida shows she is an excelllent singer. I strongly recommend it.
B000063DI9|5.0|Funny thing is when i first heard this album, i wasnt a fan of it. so i put it aside and listened to other things for awhile. years later, i got bored one day so i find this cd and i pop it in the player....best CD ever. end of story. dont know what happened. maybe my musical tastes matured, or maybe all it took was a second chance, but this is by far my favorite maiden album along side NOTB. Every song on this album is a classic. this album is a best of maiden cd on its own. it might be a little more progressive than their earlier works, but hey Iron Maiden has always been ambitious and i think it surely pays off here. I might recommend other albums like NOTB or BNW for fans new to maiden to start off with though.
B000IFS0HM|5.0|The first one - hundred pages of this memoir tell of Frank McCourt's first years in New York. They tell of his two tough aunts forcing his less than responsible - father to marry their mother. The sainted Irish mother Angela suffers through the incredible failure of her husband to provide for her and the children. McCourt is a master of retelling situations in the language of the time and people . On Clausen Street in Brooklyn in their cold-water flat his mother struggles to raise him, his younger brothers Malachy, and younger twin-brothers and little sister- Margeret. The deaths of the little girl in America send the dismayed father and family back to Ireland . But his own parents have no room for him.<br />And the saga of misery continues in wet and cold Limerick. There the twins die, and two more children are born. And the story of the irresponsible father preaching Irish Nationalism, singing and dreaming to his sons but providing nothing for the table of the family, continues.<br />This is a hard- knocks story and is told with a hard- edged authenticity.<br />The book has been a tremendously popular one. I think I understand why because the sense of hardship and the sound of the language seem real. But in truth the tale of misery and suffering was for me a gloomy one, and the book thus a far less enjoyable read than I thought it would be.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I cant say enough about how great this show is. I just wish Fox had kept it on the air. So many people here have said it, but I must restate, it was an intelligent, thought provoking, and entertaining show. It may not have the most original premise, but the overall combination of characters, enviroment, story, and subtle humor (sometimes not-so-subtle) makes this show a unique treat. If you saw and liked Serenity, you should see Firefly.
1582701709|1.0|It just goes to show that any publicity will sell something even when the product isn't worth the money.   After going to 3 different book stores and finding they were all sold out, I was at the airport and saw it on the shelf.  As you can guess, I paid full price and was full of dissapointment after trying to get through the first 20 pages.  I simply couldn't finish the book.  Save your money and keep a positive attitude.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Who would have thought that after, well basically 25 years (steve Harris started Maiden back in 75)Iron Maiden would still be churrning out killer albums? This is why I love Maiden so much. Unlike Metallica who either A. Sold out or B. became pansies, Maiden has always stayed true to their sound and to their fans, and have always brought quality to their music. About 6 years have passed without the powerful vocals of the air raid siren Bruce Dickinson, and two albums later, the old line up is back and better than ever. Not only is bruce back but dave Murry and Adrian Smith are reunited, and Janick Gers as a third guitarist. Although there isn't a single Iron Maiden album that i didn't like, i feel that some of their newer albums have been lesser than their older classic stuff. Of course that is going to understandably happen. This album i think is their return to premium form, and can be counted as one of their best albums ever. And once again like NOTB and SSOASS is filled with songs that can be placed on the best of album. the only thing its truly missing is a inspiring epic like hallowed or rhyme. thin line between love and hate and the nomad are the albums two epics, and while they are good, are not close to the epics past, although i do love the melodic middle part of nomad. <br /> <br />Maiden to this day are still coming out with new killer albums. they came out with two more since this one, Dance of Death in 2003, and a matter of life and death in 2006. I fell that this is the best of the three albums of the New Maiden line up. I wpuld recommend this album to new metal fans who are new to maiden, along with NOTB i feel this one is a great starter album.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Beautifully shot, acted, interpreted, scored, edited and nuanced.  The actors are superb and wholly alive within this screen adaption of an Austen favorite; of course, some changes were made from her book to the big screen ,they are rather slight and personally acceptable to disgard--only the scene in which Elizabeth takes to walking the park when visiting Charlotte and happens upon Darcy really should have stayed in the movie since its a huge clue to how Darcy as well as Elizabeth truly feel for each other and are attempting to show to one another, without this scene the movie remains ambiguous if you don't pay really close attention to every subtle look, gesture and tone the characters exhibit.  Besides that though it remains an excellent story to lose oneself in.
0790731940|2.0|This is a two star stinker.  We were promised hilarity, and all we got was smirking, a very thin story, and excessive length.  Either a film is a put-on or not, and this movie could not quite make up its mind.  The comedy bits fall extremely flat, and the violence is just plain nasty, as is some of the language.  In short, a complete waste of time that does nothing for the reputation of Gibson and Foster.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|There's some very well-conceived and well-executed comedic moments in 'Little Miss Sunshine.'  I found myself laughing out loud many times.  I enjoy Toni Collette in pretty much everything.  She's good here, but the standouts are Greg Kinnear (his 'Nine Steps' Tony Robbins-wannabe shtick is great stuff) and Steve Carrell.  From 'Talk Soup' and 'The Daily Show' respectively, these guys have turned themselves into wonderful actors.  In fact, the movie's best acting comes from Kinnear, especially in the scene where he sits in the audience at the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant and realizes - with growing concern - the probable talent gap between the contestants and what he imagines his daughter Olive is about to bring to the stage.  [But even he can't imagine what Olive has in store, although her music choice - 'Super Freak' - and her grandfather's taste in reading material give a pretty clear indication.]<br /><br />Despite Alan Arkin's fine work here, I still think Eddie Murphy got totally jobbed out of his Oscar.  Arkin's role is rather abbreviated here (for reasons that are obvious to anyone who's watched the film).  In contrast, Murphy's take on James 'Thunder' Early in 'Dreamgirls' is a tour de force.  If you can't win an Oscar for that performance, there's just something wrong with the process.
1582701709|4.0|In the light of negative daily news, we are blessed by Rhona Byrne's book.  Each page reminds us that, indeed, Love and Truth are more powerful than evil.  The book shows us that the time tested truths of the ages have always been available to \\"seekers\\".  It is proper instruction as how to use the Law of Attraction to our advantage.
0385487339|5.0|Whether or not you've seen the movie with Glen Close, Colin Firth, Reese Witherspoon or ,by chance, the asian subtitled version; if you loved those then you can't afford to ignore the original that spawned them all.  What a devilishly guilty pleasure it is, just take care not to blush too strongly or they might suspect what you're reading is not quite so innocent;-}
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I was expecting a lot from this new Celtic Woman concert. I truly loved the original \\"Celtic Woman\\", with the beatiful music, flashing lights and all. But what made it so great was the outstanding performances of the \\"Girls\\". \\"A New Journey,\\" does not have the cozy, personnal feel of the original. But the \\"Girls\\" do an even better job of presenting these beautiful arrangements in a more dramatic way. The Slane Castle and set are terrific, the costumes are fabulous, the \\"Girls\\" could not be more lovely and conductor David Downs and crew are truly spectactular. Every detail has been carefully thought out. I do not know of anything out there, that compares with the experience you will have, over and over, as you watch this video.This is my new number \\"ONE\\".
B000EHRVP6|4.0|For all that has been written about how gross Hostel is, I found surprisingly not as gross as I had expected.  The bloody parts don't show up until the second half of the movie, and even then much, if not most, of the horror is in our heads rather than on screen.  Roth wisely lets us imagine what is happening, rather than showing us, while we get to hear it.  As most good horror directors understand, the stuff we can imagine in our heads is at least as scary as what is on the screen.<br /><br />In one of the commentaries, Tarantino notes that Hostel is like a 70s film instead of a big modern Hollywood movie, because 10 minutes into it you don't already know what the ending is going to be.  I definitely agree.  This extends even to which of the friends is going to be the hero of this movie.  You actually go from kind of hoping they're all going to die, because they're doofuses and jerks at the beginning, to actually liking them.  If you like commentaries, there are 4 of them, and they'll keep you busy for a while.<br /><br />Hostel doesn't have a lot of moments of comedy, but there is some comic gold in there, which is what you would expect from the director of \\"Cabin Fever.\\"<br /><br />Hostel is definitely worth at least a rent by fans of the horror genre, and is a decent choice for others as well.
B000KRNCYY|4.0|I first saw these ladies on a PBS special and fell in love with their voices.  The blending of their voices sends chills down my spine. <br />The music choices, for the most part, is excellent.  I have always disliked the song 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' until I heard these ladies sing it. <br />The songs in Gaelic are fun - and though I can now sing along with most of it, I have no clue what I am singing. <br />If I had a voice like one of these women, I could quit my day job!
0784011176|5.0|I'll stay mute for this...and rapt as well, who would have thought Harvey Keitel could be sooo seductive; the entire film is hauntingly enchanting and provocative like its heroine played by Holly Hunter. A must own.
B00005JPGO|5.0|Blood Diamond is a thought-provoking and action-packed drama that resonates the global neglect of the political turmoil and rebellion Africa faced in the late 1990s, due to the highly corrupt black market on diamonds.  As the movie's title suggests it comes at no surprise that this film is brutal and graphic.  Fortunately, those depictions do not overshadow the underlying message of the movie.     <br />  <br />The end of the movie is nice but that's not to say it's predictable.  During the movie, I felt like anything could happen at any given point.  Overall, it's rare to find films like that capture contemporary world history in a way that's also emotionally moving.
B000BB1MIC|4.0|Just 16 years apart, Rory Gilmore and her mother Lorelai are best friends. They share a love for breathless quip-filled conversation and coffee, frequenting Luke's Diner in the downtown of Stars Hollow, their fictitious Connecticut suburb.  <br /> <br />In Season 1, 16-year-old Rory decides she wants to transfer from the public high school to Chilton, a ritzy private school in Hartford. To make it happen, Lorelai has to make the ultimate sacrifice -- beseech her parents Richard and Emily, with whom she hasn't been on good terms since she announced her teenage pregnancy. Although estranged with Lorelai, the elder Gilmores are more than eager to accept their young granddaughter into their lives. They agree to foot the bill -- on one condition. Both Lorelai and Rory must attend dinner at the elder Gilmores' home every Friday evening.  <br /> <br />Reluctantly, Lorelai agrees. The resulting Friday night dinners set the stage for much hilarity and snark throughout the seasons -- as well as the occasional glimpse into the Gilmores' sad past, hinting at everything that went wrong in their relationship, well before Rory's birth.  <br /> <br />Also seen on the show are diner proprietor Luke, a quiet, loyal friend to both mother and daughter with a building crush on Lorelai; Lane, the Korean-American daughter of a stern single mother and Rory's best friend; Sookie, chef at the Independence Inn, which Lorelai manages; Kirk, a quirky \\"townie\\" who mysteriously shows up everywhere anyone's doing anything; dance instructor and romance expert Miss Patty; and many others. Rory's father Christopher is also around sporadically, as he and Lorelai fight an attraction which has intertwined throughout their lives, but never seems to work out.  <br /> <br />In this season, Rory embarks on an affair with her ex-boyfriend Dean, who married the past season. Her actions drive her and her mother apart - as well as many fans, who viewed Rory's decisions as completely un-Rorylike. But meanwhile,Rory's also fighting an attraction to rich bad-boy Logan, a fellow member of the Yale newspaper and a mysterious campus secret society. Sookie learns she's pregnant with her second child, Luke's and Lorelai's relationship grows more serious, and the elder Gilmores announce their separation.  <br /> <br />Although the show is supposedly set in Connecticut, the writers and producers never really make that believable to a native (i.e. Rory and Lorelai walking around with thin coats, wide open, supposedly in the middle of winter. Still, I can overlook that -- it's fun having one of my favorite shows set in my own state. That way, I almost feel like I might really bump into a Stars Hollow resident somewhere along my way... :-)  <br /> <br />
B000LXH0AE|5.0|I am always been a Will Ferrell fan.  There is something very different about him.  An innocence of sorts.  When I saw him in ELF I could't imagine anyone else being able to pull that role off.<br /><br />The same goes for Stranger Than Fiction.  It is a fantastic story with an outstanding cast.  Will Ferrell is great as a IRS Agent who lives a very boring life until he starts hearing a voice.  Not just a voice but a voice that is narrating his life.  The wonderful voice of Emma Thompson.  Emma Thomposon plays an accomplished writer who has writers block.  She is trying to figure out how to kill Harold the main character in her story who also happens to be Will Ferrell.  Dustin Hoffman is also in the cast.  He plays a wonderful character who is an ecentric Professor of Literature.  The beautiful and talented Maggie Gyllenhaal is Harold's love interest who thinks he is just the most innocent wonderful person.  The chemistry between the two is magnetic.  A wonderful scene where he is playing the guitar singing the only song he knows as she is cleaning the kitchen.  She is drawn to the song and ends up mouthing the words.  Obviously a song that she knows and also moves her.  To round off this great cast, Queen Latifah plays the assistant to Emma Thompson who is there to help her with her writers block.<br /><br />A great story, great cast and a wonderful performances by the talented Will Ferrell and the entire cast.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|I am not now nor have I ever been a Will Ferrell fan; however, this is one delightful movie. The acting by all of the various members of the cast was competent (not great); but, it did not need to be. It was a cute story that in the end made you think about the precariousness of your own existence. Well done!
B000957O82|5.0|Finally, something other than trashy romantic comedies with nothing but bathroom humor.  As a nice guy myself, this movie resonated strongly with me.  If the story doesn't hit you on an emotional leval, the comedy will at least have you laughing out loud.  Kevin James, stealing every scene, really makes a great combo with Will Smith.    <br /> <br />If you're a good guy, you will enjoy this movie.  It just might inspire you and remind you that you are not hopeless.
0783114893|4.0|There was no need to make a remake. This movie is compelling, thrilling, chilling and will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />I remember the first time I saw it at the age of 21--<br /><br />My chest was tight, my heart was pounding, and I never picked up a hitchhiker again.<br /><br />You must add this to your collection of thrillers.<br /><br />Good cast, and convincing acting.<br /><br />This is truly an original!<br /><br />Stephen John Beccia<br /><br />Author of The Treelanders
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Gotta love those Gilmore Girls! My sister is an even bigger fan of the show and she got me hooked. Never have I seen such clever, witty writing. The show is just full of loveable moments and funny, catchy phrases that you want to repeat and make part of your own every day lingo. Its been rated the \\"Best show you are not watching\\" and its true. More people need to turn in and see why the Gilmore Girls have such die hard fans. Its a show like no other.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I graduated High School in 1969.  I've always liked the Beatles, but George Harrison was my favorite.  For George Harrison fans or fans of great rock music concerts this is the DVD to have.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|Some call The Departed overrated, but just for the record, I was shocked and amazed the first time I saw it, before I had heard anything about it.   <br /> <br />The Departed depicts organized crime in Boston.  Be warned, there is a high amount of violence and gun shots, not to mention an overwhelming amoral character given by Jack Nicholson's character.  Strangely, the fast paced story, combined with an interesting combination of A-list actors, provides for a very suspenseful and entertaining film.   <br /> <br />Many consider the ending to be disappointing.  Indeed, it's blunt, and in that sense, it could be dissapointing, but you won't really care at that point.

0618680004|5.0|I admire the courage of Richard Dawkins' conviction.  I also think that for people of God to appreciate his words is a testament to their faith, transcending the possibility of life without God. I agree that religion can be a truly destructive force if carried to an extreme for life resides in its balance.  Religion can be a crutch for the weak but it can also serve as a positive driving force for good.      <br /> <br />I believe that Dawkins' bashing of religion manifests from a perspective of fighting \\"fire with fire\\", the fire to oppose extreme religious fervor to the exclusion of all others, regardless of its form.  Once I digested his message, I realized that my spirituality had actually grown.  Coming to grips with a Godless existence, while liberating on one hand left me feeling rather hollow and alone on the other.  I found life without a mythical belief meant no life for me at all.  Thank God for such a thoughtful and passionate man as Richard Dawkins whose conviction lies ultimately in his promotion of the greater good.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|If you think The Illusionist was better you can skip what I have to say.  If you're sitting on the fence and can't decide between the two, please read on.<br /><br />I saw The Illuisonist before I saw the Prestige and I thought it was a really good movie.  Then I saw The Prestige and \\"WOWIE\\".<br /><br />The Illusionist paints romantic imagery throughout the movie while The Prestige is darker and has a more \\"realist\\" feel.  For such contrasting moods, you might be quick to jump on my back for comparing the two.  Hold on, that's not what I'm comparing.  The Illusionist does not keep your fists gripped and your back leaned forward towards the TV the entire movie like The Prestige will have you doing.  There isn't that much to follow closely, at least, not nearly as much as in The Prestige.  Furthermore, the ending is cliched whereas in The Prestige you will be shocked until the very last scene.<br /><br />Lastly, and to me when it comes to purchasing DVDs, this is the most important:  The Re-Watching value of The Prestige is much higher.  You need to watch it again and again to understand it.  Watching it with friends and family who haven't seen it is even more fun, because you're wondering if they can figure it out or not.  There is little in The Illusionist that you need to rewatch.  Hope that helps.
B000NDIAWO|2.0|I love beyonce, I truly think she's is talented but way over exposed. You can turn a corner without seeing or hearing her. Her new re-released B'Day was just toooo much. Beyonce needs to take a break and come out with music like she did on her first album \\"Crazy in love\\". B'Day Deluxe Edition is just a way to make more money.
B00066N8JS|5.0|If I could give this album 7 stars I would. The Downward Spiral is the best album of 1994 and definitely top ten of the 90s. The album which charts the journey of a man's sanity and insanity came out during a time in music when every genre was mostly fragmented and this work of art helped meld elements like post-industrial techno beats and hard and noise rock. I just want to clear something up a reviewer said about one of the tracks about this album. The reviewer said something in reference to \\"big man with a gun\\" with its \\"anti-gun toting lyrics\\" The song is actually a satire about rap music that Reznor wrote in the midst of gangsta rap which was huge in 1994. The song is all about the state of hip-hop then and even now. That being said, I'll continue with my synopsis of this album. <br />The best place to listen to the album is on your headphones connected to a home stereo during an electrical storm.
B000002U8G|5.0|I bought this for a friend who doesn't have internet access.... it made me feel powerful. :-)
B000LC55F2|5.0|\\"The audience knows the truth: the world is simple...If you could fool them, even for a second, then you can make them wonder, and then you got to see something really special.\\"  This excellent quote from The Prestige could not better describe the movie itself, because this excellently told film is a magic trick in it of itself.       The world has always been captivated by magic.  The world has also been captivated by Hollywood.  Combine these and you have a FANTASTIC movie, probably the best of 2006.  So much that it should have been nominated for Best Picture.  Like a good magic trick, the entire movie challenges you to pay attention closely, because every scene IS integral, even though the movie may seem slow sometimes.  And like most magic tricks, you'll beg to see it again.      Just for the record there are NO PLOT HOLES, or theories anyone needs to make up to understand The Prestige.  It's not confusing the second time around and believe me, you WILL want to watch it a second time.    The end of The Prestige makes perfect sense.  Enjoy it for what it is.      I don't know one person who didn't enjoy this movie.  Even my father liked it!  And he's the biggest critic of all.  My mother, skeptical at first, actually watched it, and she rarely likes watching movies (especially of this genre) and she seemed to enjoy it.        I usually like to see movies before I buy it, to decide if I want to keep it and watch it over and over again.  Therefore I have a pretty bare DVD collection.  But after I saw The Prestige once, I immediately bought it.  Add this to your collection today.  You will enjoy watching it with people over and over.
0618680004|4.0|Ok first off I am an Atheist.  This book excited me at some points and freightens me in others.  Accasionaly he makes enemies out of potential allies like with Agnostics. <br /> <br />Its a good overview of the Atheist position but i dont think its the most comprehensive or authoritative book about the subject out there <br /> <br />Also its written for the christians to read, for a person like me its \\"preaching to the choir\\" (sometimes you can escape using phrases like this)
0553565915|5.0|I re-read this book after ten years and found it to be even more uplifting than before.  It is just what I need at this time in my life during my quest for more spiritual knowledge.  Ms. Eadie is such a lovely person and so down to earth---so genuine that I can't help but be moved by her story.  I believe that anyone looking for more meaning in their life will be ever so happy to have this book in their possession.  It is a true gem.
0783225903|5.0|Brazil isn't eveyone's cup of tea  To me it is sort of a cross between the Beatles song \\"A Day in The Life\\" and a less serious version of \\"1984\\".   When looking at the negetive reviews (one star?) try and keep in mind that the words \\"less serious\\" can be a fun thing if you have a little less stick up the.....well...

B000N4SHPS|5.0|When I first moved to Las Vegas in 1986, I lucked out and got a two-week job as an extra in the Sylvester Stallone movie, Over the Top.  The filming took place at the Las Vegas Hilton Hotel and dealt with the arm wrestling contest that Stallone's character enters so that he can win enough money to take care of his son.  I was a member of the audience in the arena.  Before Stallone would come onto the set to film a particular scene, the Assistant Director would rev the audience up by playing the theme to Rocky, \\"Gonna Fly Now.\\"  Of course, the audience didn't really need to be revved up for Stallone.  I, and the hundreds of other people sitting in the stands, saw Stallone as his fictional character, and we would stand up and loudly cheek out of pure admiration.  To us, Stallone was Rocky.  Things haven't really changed much since that moment in time over twenty years ago.  For me, Stallone is Rocky and will always be so.  I still get a big, goofy grin on my face whenever I hear the theme to Rocky.  So for me, Rocky Balboa was a dream come true.  It was a chance to relieve the original \\"Rocky\\" movie and to reach a better understanding of the last thirty years of my life.  More than that, however, it gave me hope for the future.  Rocky Balboa is a true spark of life for all of us in my age bracket who are having trouble moving ahead.  This is a movie about not giving up and being able to take the hits that come your way.  It's certainly true for the character of Rocky as well as its creator, Sylvester Stallone and what he had to go through to get Rocky Balboa made.  Let me just say this.  The budget for Rocky Balboa was around twenty-four million dollars, which is extremely low for a movie in today's time.  For a film to break even, it has to make at least three times what it cost, which also covers distribution and the percentage that the theaters get from the sell of each ticket.  To date, the worldwide gross is right at $148,000,000.00.  Stallone did what was originally thought to be impossible by many others--he gave new life to Rocky and made another hit movie!<br /><br />In Rocky Balboa, our lead character is now living in South Philadelphia and is struggling to recover from the lost of his wife, Adrian, who died of cancer.  His only friend appears to be Paulie (played by Burt Young), who's still working at the meatpacking plant.  Rocky and his son, Robert (played by Milo Ventimiglia), have grown apart and see very little of each other.  Though Rocky owns and operates a small Italian restaurant called Adrian's, his heart isn't into it.  He has little to look forward to and sees his life as nearly over.  The only pleasure he gets is from visiting Adrian's grave.  Everything begins to slowly change for Rocky when two important events take place.  The first is when Rocky runs into Marie (played by Geraldine Hughes), a person from his past who gives him a reason to keep going forward with his life.  The second thing that happens is when a sport's show does a virtual reality computer fight between him and the new world champion, Mason Dixon (played by Antonio Tarver), displaying that Rocky, though older, would win the bout without any problem.  This creates in Rocky the desire to want to fight again, but only on a local level.  Dixon's people view the computer fight and immediately see a way to make a great deal of money.  After Rocky renews his fighting license, he's asked to do a celebrity fight against Mason Dixon in Las Vegas with part of the proceeds going to charity.  Though hesitant at first to get back into the ring with a heavyweight champion, Rocky finally agrees to do so with Marie's encouragement.  Robert, however, is totally against his father fighting again.  He's lived in his father's shadow for years and this will only make matters worse.  Rocky explains to his son that this is something he has to do in order to feel alive again.  He also tells Robert that he has to stop blaming others for his problems and to learn to deal with life by not giving up when things gets tough.  Of course, all of this leads to the preparation for the big fight and then to the fight itself.  I still get goose bumps when Rocky runs up the steps to the Philadelphia Art Museum with \\"Gonna Fly Now\\" playing in the background.<br /><br />What Sylvester Stallone was able to do with Rocky Balboa is to return to the roots of the original movie in the series and tap into its heart and soul.  You see it in the streets of Philadelphia, the poignant music of Bill Conti, Rocky's old home and Mickey's gym from the first movie, the shadows and dark overtones of the film, the return of Burt Young as Paulie and Tony Burton as Duke, and the haunting presence of Adrian (played by the lovely Talia Shire) throughout the film.  Stallone put his own heart and soul into the making of this movie, fighting an up-hill battle against the studios who thought his career was over and never giving up, knowing that this film was a reflection of his own life and struggles.  Rocky Balboa is definitely the way the series needs to be ended.  It's a direct mirror of what can be good in a person's life if he's willing to put forth the effort.  I don't know about other people, but when I saw this movie in the theater last December and then again of DVD last night, it brought tears to my eyes, but in a good way.  This is the last Rocky movie.  Stallone knew that he was finally saying goodbye to his most famous character and to an intricate part of his own life.  As the final credits roll in the movie, dozens of everyday people are shown running up the famous steps of the Philadelphia Art Museum.  Each year thousands of people run up these steps and throw their arms victoriously up into the air just like Rocky.  That's how powerful the impact of this series has been on the mass public.  I used to live outside of Philadelphia during my early teens.  If I still lived there, you'd see me running up the steps, too.  Well, maybe halfway up the steps.  I'm not in as good of shape as I used to be.  But, all is not lost for us \\"Rocky\\" fans.  There will be a Director's Cut coming out before the end of the year.  My guess is that it will be a Two Disc Special Director's Cut Edition, which will include the twenty minutes of deleted scenes that were originally cut from the film.  That's something to look forward to.  With regards to the DVD extras on Rocky Balboa, there's a fifteen-minute featurette on the making of the movie, another fifteen-minute featurette on doing the big fight scene at the finale, twenty minutes of deleted scenes with an alternate ending, bloopers, and a great film commentary by Stallone.  This is definitely a movie that the fans of the \\"Rocky\\" series will love, and as the last words in the film say, \\"Yo, Adrian, we did it!\\"deal with life by not giving up when things gets tough.  Of course, all of this leads to the preparation for the big fight and then to the fight itself.

B000JBWWRY|5.0|Seeing as how the story of Peter Pan is nearly a century old and assuming that most people know the story, I'm going to focus this review on the bonus features that can be found on this amazing two-disc edition. First, I just wanna say Peter Pan is one of my all-time favorite Disney movies, and that this two-disc set is well worth the wait. The bonus disc contains a lot of special features that will enhance your viewing experience and appreciation of Peter Pan, such as games, activities, and backstage features. The games and activities include the \\"Camp Neverland\\" games and \\"Peter Pan's Virtual Flight\\". The latter takes you on a journey through the skies with Peter through London, and is kinda fun. There are also mucis videos and a DVD Storybook.<br /><br />My favorite special feature on the disc would have to be the \\"Making Of\\" featurette, where Walt Disney himself explains to the viewer how the movie came into production. We then see how this great film was animated, orchestrated, and completed. It's just really cool to have Walt in your living room again. Other Backstage features include a never-before-seen opening to the movie, deleted songs and scenes, and the \\"In Walt's Words-A New Discovery\\" featurette.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great collection. You get a great movie, fully restored and looking better than ever, and great special features. Any fan of Disney animated films will surely love Peter Pan, despite some of the film's racist depictions of Native Americans, and everybody will surely enjoy the amazing inside looks into production.

B00005QVHA|5.0|I'd recently heard the 1997 Columbia version of this CD.  This was the version which Iggy had remastered, and which included extensive, explanatory liner notes from him.   After reading the various mixed Amazon customer reviews, I noticed there was now a newer, 2002 Sony import version available.  I assumed that there may have possibly been enough negative feedback regarding Iggy's remix, that the Sony version was updated from the 1997 Columbia version.  I thought the Columbia version was great, and assumed that the newer, higher priced Sony import may even be better. But, to my ears, the Sony version doesn't sound much different, if at all.  At first, I thought the \\"in the red\\" mix was toned down a bit on the Sony version.  But, I'm not so sure now.  And, the import does not have the liner notes. When  I recently rechecked the Amazon Raw Power listings, I saw the 1997 version is still listed.  But, it is now listed as being also on Sony.  And, in the 1997  version product notes, it says the notes are from a deleted version...? So, I'm very confused!  Is this an error?  Is the 1997 Amazon listing actually the Columbia version, which is who actually issued it in 1997?  Are the liner notes actually intact?  Or, did Sony take over the 1997 printing, too, as the Amazon info seems to indicate? (It sounds as though there was even an earlier CD version issued several years prior to both of these versions, too).    As far as the music, it's great on both the versions I've heard. The other Amazon customer reviews have pretty much covered everything already. But, it's unclear to me whether the 2002 Sony import version is supposed to be superior to the 1997 Columbia release, since there are no explanatory liner notes at all.  (And, unless it's a missprint, why Sony is now listed as the label for the 1997 release)?  Before I purchased the 2002 version, I thought maybe they reverted back to the original David Bowie LP mix. I haven't heard that one, but I don't think that's whathappened. I'm going to purchase the 1997 Columbia version soon, just for the liner notes.  But, music wise, I think anyone would be happy with either version.  If it's true that the CD was actually first released several years prior to these mentioned, I wonder if the Bowie mix was used?
0307105482|5.0|I love this book, mostly cause of the illustrations, which capture everyone's imagination.  I used to beg my mom to read me this one when I was young, and now my 18 month baby is beggin me to read it to her.  She points to it on the shelf and says \\"Fly Fly Fly....\\"  Anyway, there are many pages accompanied by short but cute rhyming phrases.  I have no idea if boys will like this book as much as girls, but who knows.  its an old book, done around the 50's (i think) but its timeless and i hope to read it to my grandchildren someday.
B000MZHW40|4.0|Blood Diamond the newest Leo vehicle that got lots of Oscar buzz and came out about the same time as the Departed.  The concept of the movie centers around the illegal smuggling of diamonds from Africa and the repercussions it causes the local people.  Such horrific things those people have had to endure and make you really understand the politics of that world a bit better.  It's a shame that so many parts of this world are still killing each other and oppressing weaker people for the financial gain of others.  This movie also makes you really think before you buy that diamond ring for your girlfriend.<br /><br />This film is directed by Ed Zwick ( Glory, Last Samurai) He's turning into one of my favorite director, always does a fantastic just pacing the story.  He shoots beautifully and captures action and drama well.  Leo and Djimon Hounsou both did a fantastic job in this film. Leo's accent is flawless in this film and really goes toe to toe with Hounsou on the intensity.  I'm not a huge Leo fan but after works like Gangs of New York, the Aviator, the Departed and now this film I'm starting to see the appeal of him, he is a very fine young actor that is on the fast track of following in the footsteps of cinema legends like Nicholson, DeNiro, Pacino and Brando. This was a great role for him to show case many of his talents.<br /><br />This film is more of a standard action/adventure type of movie that has a very nicely written script that movie the story and still give the characters time to spread their wings. You have a some sub plots going on but never lose focus that everyone wants this huge blood diamond.  This is one of those movies that is just very entertaining.  I could recommend it to most of the people that enjoy a good thought proving movie that not too deep and never try's to go over your head.  If you see it for a good price, pick this one for your collection.  The only reason this isn't five stars is because once I turned off the film i really didn't think about it too much, but that's ok, I loved it while i was watching it't think about it too much, but that's ok, I loved it while i was watching it
1932907009|4.0|I found this book great for the BS2 story structure inside. I feel this is the most essential element in the book. After this point from the book, I felt (from flipping ahead, but not actually reading the whole book) that the rest of the book was commentary on the theme of the BS2. It would certainly help for those needing it I believe. However, I like to take the author's advice, and just watch movies to see the BS2 in action. Good Book, gave it four stars because it didnt keep me interested past the BS2.[[ASIN:1932907009 Save The Cat! The Last Book on Screenwriting You'll Ever Need]]
0345451325|5.0|I was truly surprised at how well fleshed out this world was. I've played the first game of the Halo series on the PC and really enjoyed it. The plotline of the game had a nice twist to it. That's what i was expecting; that the book have one good twist to the plotline.<br /><br />I was happy to be proven wrong. It wasn't that there was a real twist to the story. I was more surprised at the depth the story had coming from a world created to \\"house\\" a first person shooter video game. I found it exceedingly easy to identify with many of the characters, even the minor characters who manned the different posts of the large spaceships. It's obvious the author took great care in fleshing out the Halo universe and bringing an element of humanity to it.<br /><br />That being said, there is also plenty of action to keep the pages turning. The constant battles the soldiers are involved in and how they continuously out-do the enemy is exciting to read. To be inside the unit commander's head as the action unfolds makes the action really hit home. For example, when fellow soldiers are injured, you feel the momentary hesitation as the commander realizes it was his decision that caused his trooper to be wounded.<br /><br />Although Orson Scott Card's \\"Ender's Game\\" is on a level all it's own, this book reminded me of that story. It was mostly the similarity of the battle against the inevitable tide of outsiders that seemed hopeless to win, yet the main character continues to fight on, because he doesn't know what else to do.
B000G75AE8|5.0|Im a 35 year old who grew up listening to bands like slayer,metallica,anthrax,&megadeth to name just a few.I loved thrash metal infact the harder the better for me,but of course as I grew older so did my tast in music.This cd came out about 5 months ago and im just now getting into it.my love for slayers music has always been,its just not as strong as it was 15 years ago,that has all changed recently with the release of CHRIST ILLUSION by far slayers best work to date.Im sure that many will disagree on this but with tracks like eyes of the insane,skeleton christ,jihade,&cult you just cant argue with such perfectly crafted songs that just wont let you up once it has pounded you face first into the ground.I dont know if it was the return of Dave Lombardo to the band or that slayer has perfected the formula for bloodthisty fist pounding hardcore thrash metal like its nobodys business but thier own.if you havent checked it out yet dont hesitate any longer for now before us is the best slayer album ever.

1596912367|4.0|Always excepting John Le Carr&eacute;, I'm not ordinarily a big fan of spy stories -- but this one is a considerable exception. Ruth Gilmartin is a late-twenties single mother and tutor at Oxford in 1976 who has a somewhat prickly relationship with her aging but still very sharp widowed mother, Sally. Then one day Sally tells her daughter her real name is Eva Delectorskaya and that she was a Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; recruited by the British Secret Service in 1939. Ruth has doubts about her mother's mental state but the vividness of her extremely detailed memoir -- passed to Ruth episodically -- convinces her. The thing is, Sally is sure someone is planning to kill her. The chapters alternate between Sally/Eva's third-person narrative and Ruth's quiet life teaching English to foreign engineers and businessmen, with Eva doing things as a yong woman in pre-Pearl Harbor Europe and the U.S. that her daughter -- now about the same age -- can hardly believe. Both women are fully three-dimensional, and so is Lucas Romer, the spymaster with his own agenda, with whom Eva fell in love. Boyd also does a terrific job elucidating the propaganda war Britain fought to try to get America into the war, planting false news stories and disinformation to sway public opinion. James Bond this ain't. A remarkable and riveting book with an extremely realistic non-Hollywood ending.

B000MV9026|5.0|I loved the diversity in music in this film! There was a great mix that went well with the story, making it enjoyable for adults as well as children. There are some PG-13 moments with very slight hints to 'reproduction', so parents will want to view it first and determine if it's age appropriate for their youngster. The story is a wonderful tale about a penguin that doesn't have a song in his voice because it's in his feet. If he can't find his own heart-song, how will he ever find a mate? The movie touches on environmental themes, references to being different and finding your own unique qualities, as well as introductions to other cultures. The music plays a key role and is very well woven into the screenplay. Overall, I thought it was very enjoyable and none of the issues the story was trying to highlight were 'preachy'. I'll watch it again and again.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
0553588486|2.0|I finished this book, and at 800+ pages, that means it has some value.  However, I had the impression this would be a FANTASY book, not a medieval power struggle that happens to take place in an alternate universe.  Aside from the preface, there are no fantasy or supernatural elements in the story until almost 500 pages in.<br /><br />There are many, many characters in the book, and that's certainly daunting when you first start.  Add to this the fact that some characters go by different names, and it makes it a difficult book to get into.  However, I did get into it enough to read all the way through, and certainly by the end of the story I knew all of the major characters.<br /><br />One other issue I have is that the book doesn't really stand by itself.  Things happen, but there's no sense of a build to a climax.  In fact, it really seems like a deliberate effort to set things up for the next book in the series.  That's fine, but it's better if a book can stand by itself.
B00003CXD5|5.0|This black and white classic tells a lesson in greed. Humphrey Bogart plays a street beggar in a border town of Mexico who believes he'd be satisfied with just a little money. He doesn't need a lot. This belief will be put to the full test when him and his two friends are able to scrape together enough money to set out gold digging. Bogart's character is humble toward his friends until they strike it rich, then it's 'gold fever' galore. Walter Huston won an Oscar for his role and John Huston won Academy Awards for writing and directing this film. The violence is low key, so it's really something the entire family could watch, especially since it's such a great moral tale on how real gold is found in friendships and family.<br /><br />Chrissy K.

B000MV8AE0|4.0|In October of 1955, Charles Schulz did a series of [[ASIN:1560976470 \\"Peanuts\\"]] strips dealing with Schroeder and [[ASIN:B000065UNT Beethoven's 9th Symphony]].  Schroeder listens to it in an overcoat because the first movement was so beautiful it gave him chills.  The October 27th strip has Charlie Brown reading to Schroeder how: \\"At the conclusion of the symphony the audience stood up and cheered.  Beethoven, however, because of his deafness could not hear them, and because his back was to the audience could not see them.  With Tears in her eyes one of the singers led Beethoven to the edge of the stage where he could see the cheering people.\\"  At this point Schroeder buries his face in his hands and emits a heartbroken \\"SOB.\\"    There are many stories about that first performance, and while no one knows for sure what has the most credence is that Beethoven wanted to conduct his work, but his deafness made it impossible, so Michael Umlauf, the Kapellmeister of the Kärntnertortheater in Vienna conducted the orchestera.  Beethoven was behind him on the stage, giving the tempos at the beginning of each movement and beating the time.  The orchestra had been instructed to ignore the composer and when the symphony was over Beethoven was still beating time and turning pages of the score.  That was when the contralto Caroline Unger walked over and turned Beethoven around to see the cheering audience, who were raising their hands and throwing things into the air to make up for the fact the man they were cheering could not hear their ovation.      \\"Copying Beethoven\\" looks at the last years of the life of Ludwig van Beethoven (Ed Harris) and writers Stephen J. Rivele and Christopher Wilkinson, who did the screenplays for the biopics of [[ASIN:B0001XAOL6 \\"Ali\\"]] and [[ASIN:B000063V8K \\"Nixon\\"]] (and are currently working on a film about Jackie Robinson), create the fictional character of Anna Holtz (Diane Kruger), a young woman who is sent to the apartment of the maestro to turn his original pages for the score of the 9th Symphony into something that can actually be read and printed for the orchestra.  At the premier performance of the work the composer will indeed conduct the work himself, but with Anna working as his ears to give him the proper tempos, and it will be Anna who will turn Beethoven around so that he can see the applause.      What will surprise you is that this film's interpretation of this memorable moment comes not at the end of \\"Copying Beethoven,\\" but about an hour into this 2006 film.  It is the highpoint of the film and then the story continues for another half hour, with decidedly less impressive results.  My favorite scene actually comes early in the film, when Anna is trying to explain that she is indeed the copyist who has been sent to turn his original pages for the score of the 9th Symphony into something that can actually be read and printed for the orchestra.  It is in its own small wall the counterpart to the scene at the end of [[ASIN:6304712936 \\"Amadeus\\"]] when Mozart is explaining to Saliari how the pieces of \\"De Profundus\\" fit together in his \\"Mass.\\"  Beethoven finds an \\"error,\\" and in her explanation we have our proof that Anna knows what she is doing and a glimpse into the technical nature of Beethoven's genius.  But far too often director Agnieszka Holland ([[ASIN:B00007KQ9X \\"Europa Europa\\"]]) focuses on Anna instead of the maestro.      Ultimately, \\"Copying Beethoven\\" is too caught up in the character of Anna.  What could have been a nice conceit, giving the maestro someone to talk to about living with deafness and to articulate what he was doing to change the world of music, is turned into a proto-feminist figure who wants to make her own mark as a composer.  As he turned deaf Beethoven started keeping conversation diaries, a rich source of the composer's thoughts regarding his music, so there are original source material to be mined for gems similar to what we get a glimpse of early in the film.Instead, we waste time on Anna's struggle to write music, a plotline that really has no where to go and which ends up being enveloped in the idea that the Beethoven's last works so radical and so far ahead of their time that they could not be comprehended by the audiences of the Romantic Ear.    I have to say that the actual performance of the 9th is far too short for my taste and the emphasis becomes not so much the music as it is the place where it takes both Beethoven and Anna (ironically, while he is conducting without ears as it were, she keeps closing her eyes as she becomes enraptured).  There is a problem in that the way the situation is set up you are inclined to think that they are skating on the edge of disaster and that either one of them could make a horrible mistake.  This tends to take away from the music and at least there are a few shots of members of the audience moved by the realization that this deaf old man, who had not premiered a symphony for a dozen years, was unleashing a work of monumental greatness.      \\"Copying Beethoven\\" also suffers in comparison to [[ASIN:B00000K3TN \\"Immortal Beloved\\"]], the 1994 film about the composer that had the virtue of framing Beethoven's life in the quest to uncover the mystery woman in his life.  But watching Harris play Beethoven conducting his symphony is pretty captivating and throughout this movie there is always Beethoven's music, so there is ample grounds to round up on this film.  Finally, if the main effect of this film is that you go out and listen to the 9th Symphony from start to finish, which is exactly what I did, then you would be ahead of the game.

1582701709|1.0|I went into a bookstore to buy a book that I have wanted to read for a long time and I came accross this particular book. I was so excited because I overheard a few people talking about it sometime back. Let me just say there is nothing new in this book that we havent already heard. I didnt finish it because I thought it was getting in the way of my faith.
B000028U0Y|5.0|This guy is unsurpassed for his putting his soul out there, and his beat is something else. This is his classic album.
B000MXPE7O|3.0|Put no doze in your popcorn. The acting is great but continuous shifting from 1945 to 1961 broke the continuity of the film. If you can stay awake you'll find this movie to be an interesting but narrow historical perspective of the CIA, it's racist origin, function, outlook and legacy. Robert DeNiro used a laid back method of telling this tale directorally.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|Simply one of the best CD's I've ever purchased.  He has captured life in the moments of middle age that those of us from the 70's can relate to in this chapter of our lives.  VERY well done.
074356619X|2.0|There is a lot of talk about the \\"Secret\\" but I really did not think it was \\"new\\" material. I find it rather interesting that with all the brilliant healers and scientists on this planet, that the people included in this work are only from the U.S.. <br />I certainly do not agree that little children or unfortunate people that live in war torn areas \\"draw\\" this to them. Sounds more like a marketing tool than a message of peace. Where is the compassion for others less fortunate than us?
B000MGUZM0|4.0|This is music so dense it could almost crush you. Organs add layers to strings, vocals cascade like choirs and the lead singer projects like he's in the church. \\"Intervention\\" even sounds like a call to heavenly arms...until the verse that blasts it all away comes up:<br /><br />\\"Working for the church while your life falls apart.<br />Singing Hallelujah with the fear in your heart.<br />Every spark of friendship and love will die without a home,<br />hear the soldier groan - we'll go at it alone.\\"<br /><br />That is one of the best moments on Arcade Fire's \\"Neon Bible.\\" The unclassifiable Canadian conglomerate mixes in a lot of different styles and influences to create a long player that is rich on atmosphere and irony. The immediate comparisons are to Davids Bowie/Byrne, but one also suspects that The Pixies, Echo and The Bunnymen and Joy Division may have figured into the band's formative years.<br /><br />It all winds together in droning angst and mysterious emotions that probably only moping teens really fully understand. \\"Neon Bible\\" is filled with the kind of manic/depressive lyrics that are just perfect for loners banding together (\\"I'm gonna work it out!\\" bellows vocalist Wim Butler during \\"Ocean Of Noise\\") and rebelling, as Arcade Fire urges you to do on \\"Windowsill.\\" Even in their more calm moments, like the title song, Arcade Fire are definitely doing the big search for secrets of life.<br /><br />Occasionally the band is happy to cut through the density and just cut a fast and loose rock song. \\"No Cars Go\\" and \\"Keep The Car Running\\" will fill that void (and draw comparisons to Springsteen?). But for the most part, the lush rock and roll theatrics of \\"Neon Bible\\" insure that Arcade Fire will be able to keep their indie-cred and still set themselves apart from the cookie-cutter music that infiltrates the airwaves. Who else would have the guts to show up on \\"Saturday Night Live\\" with banjos and accordions?
B00005OM5L|5.0|I don't see how you can be a true EC fan and turn off I Shot the Sheriff on this DVD. What makes him so good is that he can play the same song on 2 different nights and it can be so different. I think this is EC at his best.
B000MNP2K8|5.0|I was one of those people who thought Daniel Craig would be a bad Bond (wanted Clive Owen) and thought it was worse to use the title 'Casino Royale'. This movie, though, is for everyone! Bond is more human, makes mistakes, and comes off as a little cocky at times.<br /><br />This Bond, as others may say, is like 'From Russia With Love', where the movie rests more on the characters than the gadgets, the girls, or the cars. There are no \\"gadgets\\" except a few normal items (smartphone, defibrillator, the gun, the Aston Martin).<br /><br />I recommend even the person who has never seen a Bond to watch THIS ONE.<br /><br />- SJW
B000B8QG22|5.0|This is a Robin Williams classic. Realistic scencery and excellent story line. A must for all collections.
0151013047|1.0|This book is filled with cliches, starting with the title. It is boring and filled with a lot of anti capitalist, anti American stuff. The author cheers at the 911 attacks, and sees the terrorists as holy warriors. He has become wealthy by the capitalist socioty he now despises.
0345349571|5.0|Tuchman is a great historian. She has a way of explaining things that is very bright, clear and interesting. And this particular book I consider it to be her best. The 14th century is full of events, begining with the black plague that killed one third of the European population . She found a way of connecting these events through the life of one nobleman, Engerrand de Coucy.
B000IOM1RI|3.0|It's much better than their crappy debut cd and I liked 9 of the 15 tracks, 2 or 3 are less than 30 seconds so that's kind of pointless but still mostly good funny songs especially Kickapoo, Classico and Beelzeboss. Of course the movie is even better, one of the best comedies ever made.
1582701709|1.0|The first and most obvious problem with \\"The Secret\\" by Rhonda Byrne is its title.  The author's premise is that she has sifted through all the religions and philosophies of the world and has discovered that the secret to life has been under our noses all this time.  It is truly thrilling to know that Rhonda has finally achieved what billions of people over thousands of years have failed to understand or at least articulate well. <br /> The true secret is that there is no \\"secret\\".  The purpose and meaning of life have been clear to any person in the past two thousand years who cared to take the time to pick up a Bible.  Dear reader, please realize that by the very naming of her book, Rhonda Byrne is claiming that God has been hiding the purpose of life from us until now. <br /> This is a great offense to God.  He has taken great pains over the millennia to reach out to us and communicate His heart.  He even came to the earth in the form of a man and died for us so we could understand the great extent of His love.  We have simply ignored His words. <br /> Byrne's great arrogance is also shown in that she has the audacity to improve upon the Bible.  The Bible is the best-selling book of all time.  It has changed Billions of lives for the better.  Its existence is responsible for the creation of hospitals, orphanages, public schools for children, and even the abolition of slavery.  None of those things would have occurred without the Bible.  Yet Rhonda, in her little 200 page book, believes she can correct the amazing life-changing Word of God. <br /> Are you one of those people who think our opinion represents just one interpretation of the Bible?  Or that we're being too narrow?  Is it your opinion that we can't really know what the Bible means or says?  Or that its words aren't the most powerful of any book ever written?  If so, then it is most likely you are also a person who does not read and study the Bible regularly.  No man or woman who knows the Bible well and studies it could be misled by the teachings of Ms. Byrne. <br /> All that said, let's get to Rhonda's \\"secret\\".  What is the amazing \\"secret\\"?  That the universe has a law of attraction.  That everything good that happens to you is because you think positively.  If bad things happen to you, it's because you are negative, so negative things are attracted to you.  If you don't have everything you ever wanted, then it's because you aren't thinking positively enough.  According to Byrne, this goes for everything.  Including health, wealth, romance, and whatever else you can imagine. <br /> According to Byrne, if your father gets cancer, it's his own fault for the way he thinks.  Too bad for him!  What about the mentally retarded?  What about babies born with birth defects?  Did they attract their disabilities while they were meditating in the womb?  What about people who are killed by drunk drivers?  What about the faithful wife whose husband opts to cheat on her after thirty years of marriage?  What about people who die in earthquakes, tidal waves, or hurricanes?  Did these people simply receive what their minds attracted? <br /> Now, the general principle of positive thinking is a good one.  It's common sense that if you have a positive outlook, your life will be happier than if you think pessimistically.  It's also common sense that if you take action in your life, you'll achieve much more than if you sit on the couch. <br /> But that isn't Ms. Byrne's point.  She says there are spiritual forces at work which will bring us great blessing, in fact, everything we want, if we simply think good thoughts strongly enough. <br /> This is the most fundamental problem with Rhonda's book.  She is trying to use Christ and His teachings to encourage you to become a selfish individual.  She wants you to focus on your needs and your wants so strongly that you will make them happen through the strength of your thoughts. <br /> God hates this teaching.  Jesus taught us to be selfless.  To love others as ourselves.  To submit to God and His will.  Jesus gave us the Lord's Prayer.  It begins \\"Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.  Thy will be done...\\"  Notice it says \\"Thy will be done\\", not \\"my will be done.\\" <br /> The purpose of life is to glorify God.  It is to love Him with all our might and to submit our own wills to His.  Jesus promised us that \\"Whosoever tries to save his life, shall lose it, and he who loses His life for my sake will find it.\\"  If you grasp and strive after your own dreams and aspirations, Jesus promised you will lose everything. <br /> However, if you submit yourself, give up everything to God, He promises you shall gain more than you ever dreamed.  If there is a secret, this is it.  You will never gain life by thinking positively.  The only way to true happiness is through submission to God and selflessness. <br /> If you follow the path Rhonda wants you to follow, you will be left empty and wanting.  Her words are exciting and stimulating like crack cocaine.  It may feel real good at first, but the long term effect is devastating. <br /> Books For Less will never carry Ms. Byrne's book because we care deeply for our customers.   We don't care to make a dime off of something that will harm our customers and hurt their relationship with God. <br /> It is our prayer, dear reader, that you will be discerning in the spiritual food of which you partake.  Please be careful.
074356619X|1.0|Besides the fact that the narrator has such an irritating voice, this audio book fails as well to relate any original advice.  Obviously, the advice that is given is \\"nice.\\" However, the book is full of the type of lessons we all should fully understand by the time we are 5 years old.  Not only are the lessons completely banal, their presentment to the listener comes across as patronizing in that it suggests that people  didn't already know this stuff.  In summary, don't waste your time or money.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|They keep improving on the James Bond movies, this one is great.  I'm sure to watch in over and over.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This is m first David Lynch movie and after reading the totally mixed reviews I just had to give it a watch. Whew.... I had to watch this twice while doing research on the film in between viewings to really get a sense of what was going on, but even so, this was a great flick and VERY creative. <br /> <br />The plot is basically about the broken dreams of an aspiring actress that play themselves out with a mix of reality and dream sequences that are fun to watch unravel. Naomi Watts did a fantastic job playing two completely different characters and you cared for BOTH of them but in different ways. The \\"side\\" characters were fun and I liked how in some way they all were directly involved with the master plot.  While the ending certainly made me scratch my head the first time around, a careful viewing really does make sense of it...well.... sort of!  Thats whats cool here.... you can make your interpretations as to what everything might mean as there are several theories about what happens to the main character and why things happen as they do. Damn, theres even a website devoted to the movie that allows open discussion but I warn you NOT to spend too much time on that site( search google for mulholland drive and you'll find the website )until you've drawn your own conclusions or it might ruin it for you.  Anyways, great movie, great characters, great twists and turns.  What else can I say?  I laughed at times, almost cried once, felt terrible for the main character but also resented her too in a way. This film is crazy with its emotional roller-coaster and metaphoric imagery. Oh, and it doesnt hurt that Laura Harring and Naomi Watts are fabulous babes either.... that was just icing on the cake. <br /> <br />Also, this film has a sequence towards the end that is spectacular and ripe with emotion. It left me almost breathless and shook-up. Its really \\"haunting\\" but not in a scary way, more in a .... well.... you'll know what I mean when you watch this film.   <br /> <br />That being said, this film is NOT for impatient idiots that cant sit still for 10 minutes and have to be spoon fed their plots and solutions like an infant. Watch this when you feel like \\"getting into\\" a movie, not just when you want to burn two hours on a rainy night with nothing else to do. Expect to be confused at first and expect to watch it a few times to get the most out of it. No movie has had this type of effect on me since 2001:A Space Oddyssey which also demanded multiple viewings and gets a lot of chat and discussion to ponder its many meanings and metaphors. <br /> <br />HIGHLY recommended, provided you're into films like this!!!
B00005ASOI|5.0|I hadn't seen this classic horror movie since it was in the theatres in the 70s. Still a classic! \\"So you think you can kill Elaina Marcos?\\"
B00006AUIG|2.0|I took a shot on this movie figuring that the concept was relatively fresh and I have been into thrillers lately. So, I tried it. <br /> <br />The scenery was terrific, the setup had lots of promise, and the cinematography was eerie.  So, what went wrong?  Easy.... the plot was empty and as others have stated, nothing ever really came of anything.  There were a few build-ups with various characters discovering things in the hospital or finding out secrets but hardly any of it amounted to anything and this was disappointing.  Again, great camera work and the building was truly creepy.... but thats not what makes a great thriller. You have to have a solid story and believable suspense tactics and there simply werent any.  And the characters....Uggggh! <br /> <br />The film tried desperately to develop each of the main characters but in most cases they were hard to care about and a few of them I would have gladly enjoyed seeing get killed in a slow, painful way.   <br /> <br />Go ahead and try it if you'd like but I suspect that you will be underwhelmed as this film tries to make a feature length adventure/thriller out of a few cool wide-pan hallway shots and strange voices. Ultimately, it fails as a thriller and has a very light plot and mostly annoying characters. Its not the worst I've seen but it let me down as the expectations were pretty high after the first half hour. <br /> <br />Not recommended.
B000MM0L2S|4.0|a very diverse and interesting collection of hybrid pieces based upon the work of morricone.  my only complaint was that the invited artists were not highlighted enough in the pieces.  otherwise, i would given this a 5.  I especially liked the european flavor of many of the pieces.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|I wasnt sure what to expect with this movie as it could have been great or could have been extremely cheesey with little room in between. Gladly, it was great and I ended up adding to my collection which says a lot since I only buy movies that I feel have long term viewing value.<br /><br />The plot was a fairly basic \\"poor boy meets rich girl\\" with the usual forbidden relationship maneuvers. This storyline has been used before but the delivery of it and the magic background really made it fresh and original. I was totally submersed into the film within about 15-20 minutes which is always a good sign. I enjoyed the magic and the strange events surrounding the magic. Was it real?  An Illusion?  Mixed?  Was anyone else involved in making it all work or did the illusionist work alone?  These were all interesting points to ponder as the film rolled along.<br /><br />Character-wise the movie did a gerat job of building relationships between key people and allowing the viewers to actually care for most of them. Even the supposed \\"bad guy\\"( Rufus Sewell) deserved our condolences as you will see. Ed Norton did his usual great job with his role and Paul Giamatti was excellent as the Police Inspector that was torn between whats right and wrong and whats best for his career. Jessica Biehl was a little bit out of her league here though and she was forcing her lines a little bit. This part was obviously a little bit of s stretch for her but she did try at least.  Her accent was sort of bad and again...she just wasnt that believable. Shes great looking though which doesnt hurt.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film. The scenery and atmosphere are terrific, the acting is mostly great, and there are enough interesting twists and turns to keep it fresh and interesting. It wasnt perfect by any means but few movies are. The key here is that they got this mostly right and its good enough to be watched more than once.<br /><br />Highly recommended!!!!
B000NA1Z1A|5.0|People, if you haven't bought this album yet, go buy it today. There is a reason that people love this woman. Yes, she is unapologetically blunt (when it comes to sex, drugs and everything in between), yes, she dabbles with drugs in real life, and yes, her sound is authentic and DAMN good. I think I'm in love with that voice. I'll tell you why.....<br /><br />Amy's voice is at once sexy, sensuous, expressive and seductive, and her band is seamless (great horn and percussive section!). What's more, her lyrics are fantastic and unabashedly honest (at times lewd, yes, and allude to her addiction to blow AKA cocaine). She is probably best known for \\"ReHab,\\" \\"You Know I'm No Good\\" and \\"Back to Black.\\" I feel like I am back in 1960, listening to soul, and then the expletives come pouring out....but, smooth as silk. You can't blame the girl for being angry. I don't know if Amy has just had some tough luck with men, or whether they just take delight in treating her like trash. At any rate, this woman totally channels the rush of emotions that comes with broken relationships, as well as the rush of drug addiction. If you want to hear a good example of the broken-ness, I reccomend \\"Me & Mr. Jones.\\" (or most of the other tracks!)<br /><br />This woman is amazing. I just hope (and I say this with sincerity), that she doesn't overdose before her remarkable career truly fluorishes worldwide. Note: As I said before, this album is explicit and has references to sex and drugs (quite graphic sex, at times). Still, this is one of the best soul albums I have heard. She puts Christina Aguilera and all of those wannabees to shame......Praise the lord, soul has returned!
B00001U0GQ|4.0|After reading the book,it became my favorite.So I was disappointed that the movie did not follow the book very much.About half the book was missing from the movie and the relationship between Hawkeye and Cora is all Hollywood.In the book,Cora and Uncas die.Not Alice,Uncas,and Heyward.And I was so heartbroken by the portrayal of Heyward as a cold,heartless military man who meets his demise at the stake.That is not how he was in the book at all!I do give the movie makers credit,however for the stellar score and realistic storytelling.It was not a bad movie,it was just disappointing if you're expecting the same story as the book.
B000LAZDQA|1.0|Integrating graphic (and oddly monotonous) sex scenes into an indie serio-comic relationship comedy (think of a typical Jennifer Aniston-type NYC bachelorette feature with antiseptic hardcore sequences), does not an interesting movie make. Booooring! Hedwig, this ain't.
0307237699|5.0|After reading Senator Obama's first book I simply knew i had to read this book as well. I enjoyed the blinding insight in his writing, His writing speaks volumes about the thoughtfulness and genuine understanding this great American possesses. This Harvard educated man is fearless as he wrestles with genuine issues that affect all Americans. I think his kind of thinking is what we need in the oval office so we can heal this country and move towards genuine solutions. His writing shows that he is not a business as usual politician and his thoughts are refreshing and needs to be inserted into our national dialogue.
B00011F5DK|4.0|I bought this item as a gift for a 5 yr old boy and he likes it a lot.  He enjoys playing by the rules but also enjoys \\"freeplaying\\" and making patterns with the blocks.  The pieces feel good to the hand.  I recommend it.
B000CNFC76|4.0|As with most screen adaptations, this movie lacks the detail of the book.  But what's in the movie is well done and fairly true to the book.  Virtually all of the characters are consistent with the mental images that I created when reading the book (except for Francis' mom, who is much too pretty in the movie).  Eddy the caddie is a stitch! <br /> <br />Congrats to Disney for making a good family film about a real story.  You will like the period landscapes, clothing, and golf.  If this movie grabs you, go buy the book - it's five stars. <br /> <br />Things that I didn't like or were left out: <br />- The Open was portrayed as Francis' first competition - he had fair experience in amatuer contests before <br />- Francis and Vardon shared hard scrabble youths, would like to have seen more of that.
0553579908|4.0|In this second volume of Martin's massive fantasy series, the throne of the Seven Kingdoms in under siege.  King Robert was slain by his adulterous wife, Cersei Lannister whose incestuous relationship with her twin brother Jaime spawned three children including the purported heir to the throne, Joffrey.  Robert's older brother, Stannis, has laid claim to the throne as Robert's oldest surviving relative. But Stannis has turned to a dark sorceress whose own schemes will taint Stannis's honor and corrupt his fight.   In the North, young Robb Stark, heir to Winterfell has been declared King of the North; he is struggling to assemble an army which can defeat the Lannister hoard.  And across the sea, Daenyrs, the last survivor of the Taergaryen dynasty, is determined to reclaim the throne of the Seven Kingdoms from the usurper Robert's family.   She is the mistress of the last three dragons in the world; hatched by her own blood, sweat and fire. Caught up in the sweep of intrigue are Arya Stark, the 10-year old sister of Robb who escaped capture by the Lannisters after her father was executed by mad King Joffrey.  Masquerading as a boy, Arya is travelling back to Winterfell to rejoin her brother and mother.  In the capital, Cersei's dwarf brother Tyrion, struggles to protect the realm from King Joffrey's violent impulses and Cersei's hunger for power.  Accompanied by his [...] Shae, Tyrion has been dispatched by his father, Lord Tywin to control Joffrey while Lord Tywin defeats Stannis and Robb Stark in battle.  But in the north, another threat to the kingdom is developing.  Long confined by the Great Wall, a force of wildings, men and women who live outside of society, is forming.  They are being forced south by attacks by supernatural beings called The Others who kill with a touch and raise the dead as unstoppable warriors.  Holding them back is an undermanned force called the Night Watch which includes Robb Stark's [...] half brother, Jon Snow, a resourceful, young soldier.   This magnificent book weaves an absorbing story that is filled with strong characters. Martin's greatest talent lies with the ambiguities of those characters. They are full-blooded men and women with conflicting desires and motives --- neither all hero nor all villain. As the story unfolds, the reader's sympathies change and grow.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Bought this for my husband on a whim.  You should have seen his face when he got it.  Well worth having to watch it for the 10 time, just for that.

B000002L9J|5.0|Not only was this the soundtrack of my high school years (along with Husker Du and the Replacements), but it's so great to go back and listen to it and find that it stands up so well after all these years.  Not a bad song in the bunch (although Vicar in a Tutu was always a bit strange), with the title track, Cemetry Gates, and I Know It's Over being three of the wittiest, most brilliant songs I have ever heard.  They've influenced nearly every British band that came after them (and many American bands, too) and I hope some day my (currently) 2 year-old son will be able to appreciate how much they meant to me.        <br />
B000MV9026|5.0|I watched this dvd with my 3 year old.  I am very glad that I screened the movie previously and selected only age appropriate scenes for her.  I was disturbed, but in a good way, about the destruction of the Antarctic ecosystem, melting ice, no food, etc.  In all the movies I have seen, I have never seen a seal that looked so evil as the one in this movie.  Seals do eat penguins, you know.  It was depicted much like sharks are.  My daughter loved what she saw of it.  I would say to expect questions from older children though.  There were also some comments that may not be appropriate for all children either, even though this is an animated movie.  (Those of you who watch South Park will understand.)  Viewing this movie as a family would be a good way to discuss the current ecological situation in the Arctic and Antarctic.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|I found this movie intense, well-acted, and completely engrossing.  I could not tear my eyes away from the final 15 minutes---what an incredible sequence at the end of the film.     <br /> <br />Having said that, I think there is merit to some of the criticisms that other reviewers have brought up here.   <br /> <br />a.  it's a little slow at the beginning (this did not bother me in the least, but...) <br />b.  there really is no explanation (or \\"backstory\\") given for the current state of humankind...you either have to suspend some disbelief or fill in the blanks on your own  <br />c.  there is certainly an agenda behind this movie, but seriously...there are so many classic science fiction films and books that DO have an agenda...I don't see anything wrong with that.... <br /> <br />anyhow I personally loved it.  outstanding script, direction, acting...one of the better movies I've seen in some time.
B000002ADT|5.0|[[ASIN:B00003XAQ5 Kind Of Blue]]How does one quantify the value of such a sound, or say when it's not appropriate?  It just cannot be done.  If I knew that I were to be stranded and could take a book, a DVD, and a CD, the book and the DVD would be all but impossible to decide up, and would ultimately be quite arbitrarily chosen amongst all of those that I love: the CD, Kind Of Blue, no doubt.  This is music to drink scotch to on a night when there seems to be no one else in the universe.  It is music to put on in the background as one writes, or as one reads Derrida or Lacan, or McCarthy or Borges. This is the album to take with one to one's exile with whatever book and DVD one takes.  When I sit down and really listen to this CD I can imagine perfection. I can comprehend infinity's end. I can forget that life is brimming over with imperfection and that finitude will have the last say.  Just wait until the last song is played.
006441034X|5.0|In Howl's Moving Castle, a heroic tale by Diana Wynne Jones, begins with a portrait of the boring life of Sophie, a hat-maker and the eldest daughter of three.  Considered bad luck to be the oldest of three, Sophie is expected to fail if the sisters go to seek their respective fortunes.  With this knowledge, and an apathetic outlook on the world, Sophie resigns herself to live the mundane life of a hat-maker. Then, after one astounding moment, her whole outlook on life changes.  Only later will she realize it was changed for the better.   <br />  In the land of Ingary, such things as wizards, moving castles, and magic really exist. Thus, it should have been no surprise that when the evil Witch of the Waste came into the hat shop, a horrible spell was cast upon Sophie. Under a spell that makes her suddenly change her from young to old, she realizes that she would not be able to stay at the hat shop for fear her family would not recognize her. In this pivotal moment, Sophie decides to seek out her fortune despite the expectation of failure. Once embarked on this accidental adventure, Sophie inadvertently ends up at Howl's Moving Castle.  There she meets the fire-demon, Calcifer, the wizard apprentice, Michael, and the heartless, vain wizard himself, Howl.   <br />It is not until this moment that Sophie's true purpose is revealed. Once Sophie decides to enter the castle, she recognizes that she will have to rationalize her sudden appearance if she hopes to stay. Sophie creates an alternate identity as a cleaning lady. Needing to psychologically assert control after her life's upheaval, she falls victim to an obsession with cleanliness. Sophie also enters into an unholy alliance with Calcifer, whereby each will remove the others' curse and set each other free. Calcifer asks \\"How about making a bargain with me? I'll break your spell if you agree to break this contract I am under\\" and in response, Sophie reluctantly agrees (Jones 47). This pact signifies story development, and opens the gates of character conflict.  With a curse to remove, a knack for making things come alive, and all odds stacked against her, Sophie fights the Witch of the Waste, and in the process, she must free not only Howl's heart, but everyone.  <br />The major strengths of Jones's novel stem from her descriptions of characters. The development of relationships and dynamics, sarcastic writing tone, unique story and surprising sequencing of the plot make Jones's story truly enjoyable. For example, after Sophie spends the night in the castle, Michael asks, \\"Your still here? Is something the matter?\\"  Sophie cleverly replies, \\"I'm old\\" (Jones 53). While not everyone fully appreciates sarcasm and blunt statements, Jones sets the tone in a way that makes readers look beyond the obvious and enjoy the game of witty banter. A profound and heartwarming novel, it has no apparent weakness. Howl's Moving Castle aptly creates a fantasy-filled adventure, straddling the genres of accidental adventure and accidental hero. Sophie sets of f to find her fortune, but she accomplishes so much more.   With the plot's distinctive twists and turns, sense of adventure, and the unique storyline, I give this book not only a strong recommendation, but challenge anyone to read the book and not like it.   <br />

B000MXPE7O|4.0|I found this film to be totally absorbing, and yet, I can see how it would not appeal to those who are looking for fast-paced action. The tone is intense, moody, and thought-provoking. The main character, played convincingly by Matt Damon, is very loosely based upon James Jesus Angleton, a Yale poet, who studied counter-espionage with Kim Philby in the British SIS during World War II, and who presided over counter-espionage in the CIA during its infancy. A theme that the film explores is the toll taken by espionage on the life of the effective agent who must compartmentalize himself, since the conflicting demands of his secret work and his family are incompatible. Utter detachment is the key to survival, and Matt Damon plays the spy's abdication from all emotion to perfection.<br /><br />The cinematography and costumes are stunning, the music is riveting, and the actors are excellent. It is not always easy, however, to follow the story; it took several viewings for me to piece the complex events of the narrative together. In fact, the half-dozen deleted scenes, provided on the DVD, help immensely. In my opinion, the sequences with Damon's brother-in-law, who has spent time in a Soviet labor camp and may or may not be a brain-washed penetration agent, should never have been cut, since they explain a lot about the main character's family dynamic.<br /><br />Since the scenes shift back and forth (although the subtitles explain the location and time-frame adequately), some important plot points have been lost. For instance, in one scene the son asks to become a CIA agent, but we are never told that he actually does join. Is it after his initiation into the Agency that he falls into the Soviet honey-trap? How does he get to the Congo in the first place? Does Damon's character actually suspect  the true identity of the victim in the blackmail film? And is he responsible for the outcome or is his Soviet counterpart? These are only a few of the questions that are left to be pondered.<br /><br />Since the story is highly fictionalized, I am not certain why the directors introduced the young Cambridge SIS liason officer, who speaks articulately in London of the Blitz, but who develops a pronounced stammer in 1950-something Washington shortly before he defects to Moscow. Is he supposed to be a composite of Burgess, Maclean, and Philby (who stammered but did not defect until 1963)? That sub-plot is never developed. And why give the duplicitous Soviet defector-mole in Washington the name of an historical KGB officer, Yuri Modin (who was neither in Washington nor ever defected). Even though he was in London posing as a Soviet Embassy cypher clerk and  actually running Burgess and Blunt, he never pretended to be anyone other than Yuri Modin. I found this use of a real name to be jarring, since all the other characters have been given fictional names. Why not merely call the character Ivan Ivanovich?  Seems a bit rough on Modin!<br /><br />These are mere quibbles, though, in a story that I found, on the whole, fascinating despite the length of the film.<br /><br />P.S. After watching this film for a fourth time and paying close attention to the chronology, I was able to discover at least some of the answers to some the questions that I posed above. I also believe that I have figured out the relationship of the title, \\"The Good Shepherd,\\" to the Yale \\"Whiffenpoof Song\\" that the Bonesmen sing several times in the film: 'We're poor little lambs who have lost our way . . .; We're little black sheep who have gone astray. . .\\" The lyrics to this song also give us a clue to an additional theme of the movie (as well as an allusion to another famous film): \\"Gentlemen . . . off on a spree, doomed from here to Eternity!

B000M5AJQS|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Martin Scorsese for as long as I can remember, probably as long as I've been watching movies. In regard to The Departed, you can make the valid argument that it pales in comparison to his previous masterpieces: Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, etc. However, the visceral energy sucks you in from the onset and carries you throughout a savagely brutal saga of more people getting shot in the head point blank than has ever been committed to celluloid. More importantly, Scorsese's overdue coronation by the Academy with Speilberg, Coppola and Lucas presenting his Best Director trophy was the higlight of watching the Oscar ceremony for 13 years. If you are new to the canon of Scorsese's films, I would suggest starting out on his earlier works, especially Mean Streets, Taxi Driver and Raging Bull before watching The Departed or any of his later pictures. Either way, you'll experience film making by a true genius, who are in short supply these days.

037571457X|5.0|Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi is the story of a young girl, the author, from ages 6-14 as she grows up during the Islamic Revolution in Iran in the early 1980s. Marjane's parents are progressive and attend protests as well as support their Communist friends and family members in their struggles to be free.  The story is told in black and white simple drawings that somehow manage to capture Marjane's innocence as well as the tragedy and violence of her country's upheaval.  The book, almost a collection of vignettes reads beautifully as a child's memories.  We only get pieces of stories without always her complete understanding and the story jumps occasionally, but still flows smoothly.  Marjane goes through complete confusion as to what is going on through supporting her parents to disbelieving her parents to rebellion against her parents and the world, all of this against a background of riots and oppression.  She and her schoolmates are forced to wear veils and beat their chests daily in memory of those lost in the war against Iraq.  Marjane loses family and friends in the war in ways that strip her of her innocence and ultimately her own parents.  The last frame is devastating.  Before reading this graphic novel, when I thought of Iran, I pictured the Shah, Ayatollah Khomeni, and President Ahmadinejad, but this story shows the country through the eyes of a young girl who loved her home and aches for its demise into something unrecognizable.  While written several years ago, it has become extremely timely with the events in the news today.  There is some light profanity, but nothing worse than any PG-13 movie.  This should be required reading in high school Civics classes.

B000002U9K|5.0|This album is one of the cornerstones of my collection and my history as a lover of dance pop in general.  The debut from the Pet Shop Boys is actually what I consider their best.  Compared to contemporary times, the technology was too elaborate in this era of their music, and the limitations they worked within gave the music a certain quality that was never equaled in their later albums. <br /> <br />Specifically, there is something dark about \\"Please\\".  It has a cold longing to it that worked, especially considering the image of the band at the time--unsmiling, detached, seemingly far removed from the creation of their own album. <br /> <br />Their subject matter wasn't too pretentious.  The melodies were very strong and sounded great played on such cold instruments.  \\"West End Girls\\" will always be remembered as their biggest moment, which is ironic considering the longevity of their career and the devotion of their fanbase, but it truly is a wonder.  They've done more elaborate and intelligent things since, but the simplicity of it is enduring. <br /> <br />Songs like \\"I Want A Lover\\" and \\"Opportunities\\" sounded absolutely icy in the midst of the 80s, when pop radio seemed to have a lot of crazy and, in retrospect, tasteless style.  \\"Please\\" is a case of the right thing at the right time.  It's just my opinion, but there is something here that the following albums never quite recaptured.

B000MCIBE8|5.0|Purists will no doubt scoff at the idea of remixing the classic debut album by The Doors, as many did when \\"Elvis: 30 #1 Hits\\" was released, but one comes away from this new remastering convinced that this should indeed be the definitive version available. According to engineer Bruce Botnick in the liner notes, this new edition of \\"The Doors\\" has been remixed from the original tapes and it shows. Songs like \\"Break On Through\\" and the immortal \\"Light My Fire\\" breathe with a new life and crisp, powerful sound. Previous releases are left in the dust as even background vocals are rediscovered and Robby Krieger's guitar comes alive as well as Ray Manzarek's driving organ. Jim Morrison's vocal power comes through and John Densmore's expressionistic, detailed drumming comes across as a revelation. Their cover of Willie Dixon's \\"Backdoor Man\\" snarls and grinds louder and better. Previous attempts at remixing classic albums have resulted with some accepting the result and others finding it unbearable as was the case when Iggy Pop remixed \\"Raw Power,\\" but according to Botnick there were more pressing reasons for giving The Doors' albums an overhaul, apparently the previous releases were not running at the correct, intended speed. Though some may not notice at first, the speed has been put back into it's correct place. But the real joy of the new remastered \\"The Doors\\" is how every instrument and sound comes across loud and clear here, there is scarcely a trace of this being a 40-year old recording. Drum and guitar parts that were plowed under before come alive now. And of course, it's worth listening to for the fact that's simply great rock n' roll. Jim Morrison remains the star with his Dionysian character and his brilliant use of words and poetry. Songs like \\"Break On Through\\" retain a ferocious energy while \\"End Of The Night\\" and \\"The Crystal Ship\\" are beautiful pools of sound and images, made more effective by this remix where Ray Manzarek's elegant piano/organ parts shine. Fans will be interested in the bonus tracks featured here including two different versions of \\"Moonlight Drive\\" that reveal how apart the original arrangements were compared to the famous version from the \\"Strange Days\\" album. There is an alternate \\"Indian Summer\\" which apparently has a new vocal but there's little difference to the original version in the \\"Waiting For The Sun\\" release. The Doors remain one of the most influential of all rock bands, with their imprint found in genres such as Punk, Goth and Electronica, and the artists who have been influenced are countless including Pearl Jam, Iggy Pop, Patti Smith, Stone Temple Pilots, U2, The Cure, The Cult, Marilyn Manson, David Bowie, Billy Idol, INXS, Echo And The Bunnymen, Aerosmith, Soundgarden and many, many more. 2007 marks the fourtieth anniversary of the Doors' debut, and this is a fitting release to introduce a new generation to the immortal sound of the band and the poetic, sometimes apocalyptic visions Jim Morrison produced, especially in the epic \\"The End\\" which remains a timeless, hypnotic work of art. \\"The Doors\\" is pure rock n' roll, one of the ages.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|This film is rated R.  I enjoyed the film.  It was very thought provoking. However, I could see how some of the sexual content contained therein may be offensive to some people. If you are a parent who wants to watch this film in a family setting, I strongly reccomend that you preview the film beforehand.<br /><br />Aside the controversial footage, the film delivers intense suspense and challenges the viewer to think about how hard some decisions can be under the most difficult of circumstances.  If you are cerebral you will enjoy the film  for its ability to deliver an ethically challenging script.  Brad Pit and Cate Blanchetts perfomances are excellent and impact the movie with a quality that compliments its effort.  This is a film that will challenge your senses.

B000HWXS2S|5.0|I had never heard Amon Amarth until one song came on the tv (Cry of the Blackbirds).  I bought the album and was blown away!!  I did some research and found their music is based on Norse mythology and other religious beliefs.  The lyrics are a bit strange because of that, but that does not take away from the awesome death metal riffs and smooth beat.  It's totally deep sounding, dark, evil, and intimidating, yet intense and attractive at the same time.  I listen to it and find myself head banging or moving with the rhythm.  For a band I had never heard of before now, I am totally blown away by their sound, look, and total devotion to their beliefs.  Awesome Band, Awesome Album.
B00000DCHE|4.0|THE BAND: Billy Joel (piano, vocals, harmonica), Russel Javors (guitars), David Brown (guitars), Ritchie Cannata (sax, flute, organ), Doug Stegmeyer (bass), Liberty DeVito (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1981) 11 tracks clocking in at approximately 48 minutes. Included with the disc is a 5-page foldout containing song titles/credits, song lyrics, assorted family photos of Joel'S childhood, brief notes from producer Phil Ramone & Billy Joel, what songs came from which albums and where these live recordings took place. All songs recorded on tour during 1980; all music & lyrics written by Billy Joel. Digitally remastered in 1998. Label - Columbia / Sony.<br /><br />ALBUM REPRESENTATION: Cold Spring Harbor (2 songs), Piano Man (3), Streetlife Serenader (2), Turnstiles (4). Songs recorded in various cities: Boston, NYC, Philadelphia, Washington DC, Chicago, St. Paul, Milwaukee.<br /><br />COMMENTS: I wore this vinyl LP out in decades ago, mainly due to the opening songs \\"Miami 2017\\" and \\"Los Angelenos\\". For Billy Joel, I thought these two particular songs rocked pretty well. And, they sounded so much better than the studio version from \\"Turnstiles\\" and \\"Streetlife Serenader\\" respectively. For that matter, ALL the tracks here on \\"Songs From The Attic\\" come alive... much more so than their studio recordings. In the same likeness to some of Peter Frampton's early studio material... the 'live' stuff simply sounded jumped out at the listener. The sole purpose of this album was to re-introduce some of Joel's earlier material to the folks that got into Billy Joel after his multi-platinum award winning \\"The Stranger\\" came out. Recordings ranged from the packed thousands at Madison Square Garden, to several small intimate performances containing only a few hundred fans. The remastered sound is crisp and the songs still sound fresh decades later. The name \\"Billy Joel\\" will always steal the headlines, but his band of unknowns (to most of us listeners) need to be recognized. From the Piano Man's incredible piano playing, the sax on \\"Say Goodbye To Hollywood\\", the guitars (especially the cool solo on \\"Streetlife Serenader\\"), and the solid drums (highlights are \\"Miami 2017\\" and \\"The Ballad Of Billy The Kid\\") - a very tight and accomplished band. This is a must have for Billy Joel fans (4.5 stars).recognized.

0780622553|5.0|This was one of the first DVD's I ever purchased, and it is still one of my favorites.<br /><br />I went to see Dark City because the trailers sold it as a film noir with stunning visuals.  It delivered on the noir, the visuals, and so much more.  This is one of the best movies to see completly unaware, with as little knowledge as possible, because it will blow your mind.<br /><br />It is the story of a man(Rufus Sewell) who awakens at the scene of a murder, with blood on his hands and no memory of how he got there.  Within moments mysterious men in long coats are pursuing him, a detective(William Hurt) is researching his history, and his beautiful wife(Jennifer Connelly) is sining in a night club.  Mixed within all this is Keifer Sutherland as a doctor who may or may not be on the side of the angels.<br /><br />Alex Proyas, after directing the hypnotic comic-book thriller The Crow, moves on to free territory by divesting himself of a source.  Free to create as he pleases, he concieves a film that references such varied sources as Fritz Lang's M and Metropolis and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner.  The city itself is one of the most fully realized of all fictional cities, taking shape as a character as important as any of the humans.<br /><br />The DVD itself, although one of the first released, features excellent bonus material, including a commentary by Roger Ebert that functions as a primer in the rich tradition of film history that is being referenced and built upon.<br /><br />If you love cinema that makes you think, pulls the rug out from under your feet, has amazing visuals and a compelling story, look no further.  Dark City combines the best of detective noir with a journey to the heart of what makes a man, within a framework that has just enough science fiction to take it beyond our normal experience.

The idea of having all these well-established, ego-driven authors agree to combine forces, share the stage and profits on a single project is brilliant, add the title's mystique \\"The Secret\\" and you've got a brilliant marketing campaign ready for the masses.   The content of the book however, was mediocre. I was expecting a more organized, thorough explanation of the law, it's daily applications and exercises, but that was left out. But cheer up everyone, there's going to be sequels to the book and DVD explaining the real 'meat' of the secret. Verdict: You can find better books on the topic in this site.
B000MG1ZGA|5.0|This is my second purchase in the 40th anniversary series, again it is another gem, the remixing is more subtle than the Morrison Hotel cd, the recordings are crisp and do have a more live in the studio feeling. For the purists who don't like remixed cds, get a life and grow up and stop bashing the reissues just to put your name in lights.And also state you were old enough to buy an lp copy when they came out like I did, then you'll be mature enough to talk about sound quality. So much for that business.<br /><br />  There is one particular stand out cut,Cars Hiss By My Window, there is an extra verse lyrically and Jim sound effects the make this track especially bluesy,Densmore drives the beat on this and keeps Jim in great form and time.The Manzarek tune is a neat song pulled from Wierd Scenes and fits in perfectly.The Orange County Suite sounds more like the prelude for Riders On the Storm.<br /><br />  This version is another great bargain to reaquaint your self with the doors and test your listening skills to find the differences between it's earlier issue or the lp if you still have one !

B000001E2W|3.0|Standard record company procedure: Dump band and then try to wring a few more dollars out of them by releasing a best of or some equally 'catch all' retrospective. In this case a live album. Then again the companies lose a heap of cash on failed acts so perhaps we shouldn't be too hard on them.<br /><br />This Anthrax live recording is gleaned from two sources and it all sounds pretty good. The Anthrax fan should direct themselves to the track listing and weigh up how badly they need live versions of stuff they already own. The tracks are quality thrash metal with the band firing fairly well. The atmosphere here isn't electric but it serves the purpose, actually my preference is for the liver version here of Metal Thrashing Mad than the studio version (go figure). But better live versions of I Am The Law and Caught in a Mosh are to be found on the I'm the Man EP.<br /><br />In summary, this gets 3.5 stars due to; cool cuts played well, a coo band caught in front of a couple of loving audiences and its a handy career retrospective up to the point the band left Island records. The downsides are the rip-off factor, the lack of input by the band and it's not as good a career summary as the Connoisseur collection Moshers 1986 ... 1991.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|I am a fan of dystopian-future movies, and this is certainly one of the most chilling -- and plausible -- that I have seen.  The year is 2027 and a series of cataclysmic disasters has brought humanity to the brink: New York City has been nuked, famine and political upheaval have uprooted civil society across the planet, and for nearly twenty years the human race has been rendered sterile. Ah, but there will always be an England... In this case, it's an Orwellian-fascist state riddled with violence and paranoia, with a refugee crisis that threatens to topple the fragile underpinnings of a brutal police state.  The film is very dark, but has a mordant sense of humor that is its savings grace.  It's also directed in a half-dreamy style that curiously undercuts the action-movie cliches -- a car chase takes place with in a broken hatchback that our hero is trying to bump-start, as the bad guys chase him on foot; later he loses his shoes and runs through the rubble wearing only a pair of plastic flip-flop sandals.<br /><br />All in all, this was a very effective, but inherently frightening view of the future.  Definitely worth checking out.
B0000085N4|4.0|Sun King.<br /><br />Fire Woman.<br /><br />Nuff said really, the aforementioned tunes being towering masterpieces of rock. It just doesn't get any better than these two great tunes, both of which climbed the charts in various territories.<br /><br />The Cult came to prominence with this, their masterpiece (sort of) album. Cranking out riff driven hard rock numbers that are contemporary with the hair metal daze but quite apart from them they created a far more restrained beast. Ian Astbury has soulful lyrics and a soulful smooth voice to match. His vocal register certainly isn't deep but it's rich and is full bodied - he's no high end strainer.<br /><br />As for the music it's riff driven but the riffs aren't overpowering, Bill Duffy seeming not to suffer from an ego problem - his riffs here are pretty darn good but they are part of the music, not THE music. The production is handled by Bob Rock with Mike Fraser doing the recording - so you know that aspect will be great and we also get a guest appearance from Iggy Pop of all people.<br /><br />Apart from the aforementioned awesome tracks this album is blessed with the hook laden American Horse and the beautiful Edie (ciao baby). Sweet Soul Sister is also pretty nice though the following track, Soul Asylum is a touch too similar. New York City has plenty of life and the Iggy Pop guest slot as well as fast and mellow sections that spark thing up quite a lot.<br /><br />The only real downside for this reliably good album are some of the later tracks don't quite match the excellence of the first few. There are a few good sections of songs but overall they don't quite wash. As funky as Automatic Blues is I just can't warm to it overmuch and the last couple of tracks are just below par, no other way of putting it. Which is a pity as they drag down an otherwise stellar hard rock 'n' roll release from a band that always seemed somehow distinct from the ditzy bright neon light rawk bands.<br /><br />All up I'd recommend picking this up as it's their best album and not at all tainted by the era it was born in. In fact when they played Australia Big Day Out festival in '96 they blew the alterna rock bands off the stage with clear and concise riffing and quality rock. Respekt...recommend picking this up as it's their best album and not at all tainted by the era it was born in.

0743289412|3.0|I've read all of King's previous works and have, at times, found myself squirming - not from his visions of horror and mayhem, but his tendency to get 'cutsy' with his wordplay and sentence structure. This book, unfortunately, is King at his 'cutsy' worst. As others have noted, the use of made-up words and nick-names for everyday objects is enough to drive you to distraction. Here's a typical passage: \\"Lisey's went to the bathroom door, which Scott always called the 'dank plank' and entered the hallway, which Good Ma always called the 'corridor of power,' and down the stairs, or as Dandy refered to them the 'carpet humps.'\\" Of course, that's an exaggeration, but not much of one. Now image 510 pages of that! It's a shame, because under all that clanging prose is a great story. King needs an editor with the cahonies to tell him when to reel it in.

B000H305U0|5.0|Another big move for my favorite producer Timbaland. I loved Justin before, but now, I'm a real fan...just because of the genius of Timbaland. <br />This album with Nelly Furtado's album are the must for this summer. <br /> <br />2 tumbs up for Timberlake!!!
B000N3ST7A|5.0|This is a fantastic CD. The songs are are beautiful and emotional. The dvd's are interesting and captivating to watch. Stevie only keeps getting better and better. To the reviewer who said she would tour with anyone who asked-- are you jealous? Stevie continuously makes new music that is wonderful.
B000NA28IE|2.0|This movie was watchable only because of the dragon special effects. I found the entire story cliche and out right laughed at some scenes as the appeared to be ripped from other movies, the rescripted badly.<br /><br />All in all I think Dungeons and Dragons was a better movie in this genre.
074356619X|5.0|Good material for many aspects of one's life.  This material is perfect for listening to on CD, especially while driving, because it is more impactful in the spoken word than the written.  Plus it can be listened to over and over whenever inspiration is needed, whereas the book would probably only be read once and then put on the shelf and perhaps forgotten over time.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|At first I was skeptical about the film because I'm a major Pierce Bronson fan. I didn't think anyone could master James Bond better than Bronson...well 10 minutes into the movie I was sold!!! Daniel Craig out does them all by far. He is the James Bond...love him in this movie. Great actor, plot and story line. Best I've seen, but don't take my word for it. Watch it and you'll see.
0689815816|5.0|My son is 2 years old and this is his absolute favorite book.  He knows it by heart.  If I had a penny for everytime we read it, I would be weathly and that is without exaggeration.  I would recommend this book to anyone with a child this age.  The hard cover and pages make it very durable.
0767020308|5.0|I have watched three adaptations of Emma: the 1972 BBC adaptation, the 1996 Hollywood version, and the 1997 A&E production. Of the three, the 1997 adaptation starring Kate Beckinsale in the title role is my favorite of all time. Kate Beckinsale's Emma is vivacious, witty, and charmingly infuriating all at the same time. As the main character she breathes life into Jane Austen's most lovable heroine. The 1972 BBC version had Goran Godwin play Emma Woodhouse, and though it was the most faithful adaptation of Ms Austen's work, the title character appeared too old to play Emma, lacked the vibrancy that was Emma Woodhouse, and appeared cold at times. The 1996 version with Gwyneth Paltrow, although not fully faithful to the novel [due to time constraints] had a fairly lovable Emma [though Gwyneth's attempts at an English accent left much to be desired]...the Hollywood version was entertaining though as it had a stellar cast in Jeremy Northam as the dashing Mr Knightley, Alan Cumming as the loathsome vicar, and even Ewan McGregor...BUT, my favorite version is still this 1997 A&E adaptation as Kate Beckinsale[a true English rose] truly plays Emma Woodhouse to perfection!
B00005JPMC|4.0|Shooter, the first film adaptation of movie critic Stephen Hunter's popular Bob Lee Swagger novel, is a first-rate action thriller with nice action set pieces, solid performances, and great pacing.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg, who is rapidly becoming a solid, reliable action/thriller movie star, portrays Swagger, a Marine Recon sniper who's left hung out to dry during a mission, but makes it back home when a huge distrust of government and politics. But he reluctantly agrees when he's asked to help come up with a scenario to assassinate the president in order to prevent the actual event from taking place. Before he knows it, an assassination has taken place, Swagger's been shot, and he's on the run from the FBI and the people who have framed him for the crime.<br /><br />Wahlberg plays Swagger with an appropriately unemotional tone that makes a lot more sense because he's a highly trained soldier. Danny Glover plays the leader of the shadowy crreps who've framed Swagger, Kate Mara plays Swagger's sniping partner's widow, and Ned Beatty plays a US senator involved in the subterfuge. All are very good, and director Antoine Fuqua, often criticized, proves his skill at pulling off a high-octane action film.<br /><br />One can only hope that this will be a franchise, and that they will produce the rest of the Swagger books with Wahlberg in the title role.
0800141660|5.0|I have watched this adaptation of Jane Austen's Sense & Sensibility more than a dozen times since it was released, and it never fails to enthrall me. It has everything one would expect of a classic movie - a good plot[ thanks in large part to Emma Thompson's excellent screenplay], stellar casting, gorgeous sets, costumes and lush scenery of the entrancing English countryside.<br /><br />The story of Sense & Sensibility is at heart a warm and insightful portrait of two sisters and their relationship to each other, as well as their romantic interests and a powerful social commentary of society in regency England. Those who are familiar with Jane Austen's works will appreciate how perceptive an observer she was of society at large and remarkable in her capability to capture powerful human emotions on paper.<br /><br />The plot of Sense & Sensibility the movie revolves around the Dashwood sisters, Elinor & Marianne, who upon the death of their beloved father are forced to move [together with their mother and younger sister] to a cottage in the English countryside and live on a paltry 500 pounds a year [due to English law at the time where property passes down through the male line]. Elinor [played excellently by the talented Emma Thompson] is the older, and more wise [sensible] sister, who tries not to let her emotions rule her, in direct contrast to her younger, feisty sister Marianne [a gorgeous English rose, Kate Winslet] who is passionate, outspoken and open in displaying her emotions.<br /><br />Elinor falls for Edward Ferrars [an awkward yet deferential & handsome Hugh Grant] who due to a youthful indiscretion is unable to follow through on his attachment to Elinor. Marianne, on the other hand falls hard for dashing rogue Willoughby [Greg Wise], ignoring propriety and openly displaying her affections.<br /><br />The rest of the story deals with how the Dashwood sisters resolve their plight, and the story is made even more compelling by the other characters, who may be deemed minor roles, certainly add to the depth of the storytelling - Colonel Brandon, a retired officer, who though much older, harbors a deep affection for Marianne [played by pre-Severus Snape Alan Rickman], the callous sis-in-law Fanny Dashwood [Harriet Waller], the scheming Lucy Steele [Imogen Stubbs]and numerous other characters, who though secondary to the plot, are certainly memorable.<br /><br />Taiwanese director Ang Lee [of Eat Drink, Man Woman & Wedding Banquet fame] certainly proves his mettle here and manages to flesh out amazing performances from his cast, and delivers a gem of a movie, and a true classic.nly add to the depth of the storytelling - Colonel Brandon, a retired officer, who though much older, harbors a deep affection for Marianne [played by pre-Severus Snape Alan Rickman], the callous sis-in-law Fanny Dashwood [Harriet Waller], the scheming Lucy Steele [Imogen Stubbs]and numerous other characters, who though secondary to the plot, are certainly memorable.

B000EGCITG|5.0|I love this CD and think it is Pinks best work so far!  <br />I have the uncencored version and there is a good deal of swearing,  <br />the F word is said many times among some other things  <br />some might find offense.   <br />So, I'd say if you're buying this CD for an older kid/teen  <br />buy the censored version.

B000N3T0DW|4.0|Volver is a twistedly moving tale of disturbing family secrets and reconnecting love between mothers and daughters. This emotionally charged contemporary ghost story (or is it?) weaves in and out of standard reality and a heightened version of reality that exists only in the filmmaker's mind. Each frame is clearly painstakingly prepared, resulting in a visually stimulating and colorful film.<br /><br />I had my doubts, but Penelope Cruz delivers a performance well worth her Oscar nomination. The rest of the cast is also solid, each with their own nuances and subtleties.<br /><br />What's most surprising is the comedic flair that bleeds through some of the most dramatic scenes. These moments help keep Volver afloat and stop it from dragging down into heavy melodrama.<br /><br />The extras include interviews with several cast members, as well as Pedro Almodovar, the director. There's also the special feature staple: feature commentary, and a making of featurette.
0375703764|5.0|I work in law enforcement and first heard of this book while doing a death investigation of a teenage boy who grusomely committed suicide.  I was told he had been paranoid after reading this book, describing it as the most horrifying thing he had ever read.  Clearly I had to find out why, so I bought it, read it, and honestly, I'm not sure why it made him so upset.  HOL is an excellent book that challenges your mind and makes you think, but I didn't find it as \\"scary\\" as so many others have described it.  Like many have stated before, it's a slow read and many pages take two or three reads to understand what the author is talking about.  I'd only recommend the book to those who are willing to take the time and have patience with the it.
0451205766|5.0|If you want something - go and get it, period. Or make an offer they can't refuse...
0061091480|5.0|I think this is one of the best books I have come across in along time.  It really does a great job at explaining the dynamics of every person that you know, including yourself.  You will better understand the personalities of your friends, family, co-workers, so on, and how we all work with each other as best we can.  I have a new respect for all of those around me, and I appreciate them for who they are rather than getting frustrated or resenting them for every reason under the sun.
1416905014|5.0|WOW. Can't believe the details in this briliant book. Everytime you look you find some other little detail that gets your imagination going.
B000JLTRJ0|1.0|When I pirchased this movie I though that it would be like a beginning to end movies about the destruction and the people who worked at the World Trade Center.  I was very disappointed in the movie and would not recommed it to any one. <br /> <br />Marilyn A. Dillard <br /> <br />I wish I could send it back, but I guess you do not accept returns.
B000050FEN|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS BETTER THAN AN ALFRED HITCHCOCK MOVIE. THIS IS PROBABLY BRAD PITTS BEST ACTING PERFORMENCE. IT IS DEFINATELY NOT FOR CHILDREN. IT DOES HAVE SOME BRUTAL, HORRIBLE STUFF IN IT BUT NO MURDERS ARE ACTUALLY SHOWED BEING COMMITTED.
B000050FEN|5.0|Obviously, this is (so far...) the definite DVD release of this already classic thriller. They didn't back off on the bells and whistles here, so, until some douchebags at New Line goes up with the novel idea to release a 20th anniversary edition of this DVD (don't laugh, you know they're already planning it as we speak...), any true cinephiles should have this DVD in their collection. <br /> <br />If you haven't yet... What on Earth are you waiting for?
B000N4SHPS|5.0|The Rocky saga was one of my biggest sources of inspiration as a teenager. It began, ironically, with Rocky V, which I saw in the theaters, and worked my way back. I loved every aspect of the story: determination, courage, patriotism, and faith, rolled into an everyman, beaten, but not broken, uneducated, but wise.  <br /> <br />\\"Rocky Balboa\\" concludes the story. Rocky's back in the old neighborhood, running a restaurant named for his late wife. Adrianne's passed from the \\"woman cancer.\\" Rocky entertains his guests with tales of his former glory days. However his nostagia hurts his current relationships, especially with Paulie, the same as he's always been, and his son Robert. Even time itself is leaving Rocky behind, as all his former haunts are torn down. Even his statue's gone.  <br /> <br />Still, he feels a \\"beast\\" he can't get out, and seeks one last shot. He gets it when a computer puts him against the current champion, and has him winning. The champ, Mason \\"The Line\\" Dixon, is desparate for a real challenge, and the subsequent self-respect that comes from it. So, he challenges Rocky to a special exhibition bout. <br /> <br />And this is where the film truly shines. Rocky's tapping into his roots: running the steps, pounding the beef slabs, drinking the eggs. He's also supported by characters from earlier movies, especially Little Marie, the girl he walked home in \\"Rocky,\\" and Spider Rico, his opponent from the beginning.  <br /> <br />The fight rounds off the movie perfectly. Even the fight ends the way it should.  <br /> <br />The movie's even a good piece of filmmaking. One thing I noticed was the light work. Especially in the beginning, the harsh overhead light gives the illusion of a flashback, which is exactly where Rocky's living.
B00005OM4Q|4.0|This is actually a 5-stars DVD, no doubt about it - \\"Almost Famous\\" is a great film, but its 'Bootleg' version is even better. The thing is, it lost a star in my book because this 'Director's Cut' left stores way too fast, making it unbelievably expensive for the idiots that waited too long to buy it (... yep, I'm definitely in that group!) <br />'Couple of years ago, I saw it at Music World for $14.99, but, being the dumbass that I am, I decided to pick it up later, 'cuz, even though it had a 'Special Edition' tag on it, it wasn't as if the damn thing would be a limited edition, right?... Right?! <br />Well, of course, I was wrong BIG TIME! The freakin' thing disappeared from the shelves faster than Carl Lewis on steroids, and, like so many other DVDs that I know owed (damn you, \\"Robocop - Criterion Collection\\"!!!), I then had to pay a ridiculously high price for something I could have (should have) gotten way cheaper. <br />So... yeah, this is an excellent purchase, but, if something like this happen to you too, paying three times its original price won't at all make you happy - I myself still feel burned...
0142000671|5.0|This book is one of the best books that I have ever read. It had plenty of humor and plenty of good lessons that one can use for the rest of their life. Steinbeck did an excellent job. I recommend this to anyone that wants to enjoy a good book.
B00005JPCF|5.0|I bought the DVD, sight-unseen, and am not disappointed. I take issue with many of the previous reviewers, in many ways. Peril seems to be an issue, but lessons are learned from those in peril; anyone remember \\"Pinocchio\\" or \\"Peter Pan\\" or \\"Bambi\\"? Also, Robin Williams gave some ethnic impressions (very well, I thought, and entertaining). This was necessary because the \\"Hispanic\\" penguins were of another tribe. What's the fuss? My problem was that it started out too slow, too much time setting the scene. Once it got going, I had no problem keeping up. Narrow minded people have forgotten that ethnic characters have been a part of cartoon history, so why complain now (anyone remember Babba-Looie, or the speech impediment of Elmer Fudd?). Lighten up, for God's sake. I liked \\"Cars\\", too, only because I hit the old Route 66 and was dismayed. Both are good films.
B00005O5CM|5.0|I'm not reviewing the movie as nearly everyone has seen Legally Blonde.  I'm reviewing the Amazon service and ease with which I was able to order (quick order) and how quickly the item arrived.  I purchased the movie for a friend who is going to travel and bought herself a portable DVD player and this movie is one of her favorites and she didn't have it.  She's 62 and loves the movie so I gave it to her as a goodbye gift.  It was a breeze ordering and the item arrived incredibly fast.  The only thing I wish I could change is that the quick order only allows for home delivery and it would have been easier to have it delivered to my work.  The whole order experience was just great.  My friend loved the gift.
B00003CXMG|5.0|The film captures the early 70's in lovely tint of nostalgia.  Everything from clothes, to dialogue feels authentic.  Adding to this is the excellent musical selections.  Not only do they fit the period, but they tie into the movie as well. <br /> <br />Acting is solid all around.  Patrick Fugit inhabits the character of William Miller.  How much of the performance is based on Cameron Crowe, and how much is truly Miller, the world may never know.  It doesn't matter, he does a great job.  Billy Crudup delivers as Russell Hammond.  He's at times likable, annoying, and cruel (even if he doesn't know it).  In the end we like Russell, but we also want to have Elaine beat him upside the head a few times.  I'm not a huge fan of Kate Hudson, but she does a great job as Penny Lane.  It's still my favorite part she's played, and I think she'll have a hard time topping it.  The supporting cast is equally good, with Francis McDormand nearly stealing every scene she's in.   <br /> <br />Cameron Crowe's film is more than a little autobiographical.  The script does glorify the time period at times, but it never harms the film.  Instead it gives the viewer a cozy feeling.  The ending is never really in doubt, but the journey is what makes it work.  Crow's direction is solid and involving. <br /> <br />This is one entertaining movie.  It skillfully combines comedy, romance, drama and nostalgia, balancing the mixture perfectly.  Any fans of music or coming of age stories will find plenty to enjoy here.  The theatrical cut seems a little too light at times, but the longer version (called \\"Untitled\\" by the director, and currently out of print) is more gritty and delivers a more satisfying film.  Don't let that detour you from checking out this version.  \\"Almost Famous\\" is a great movie.
B000DZIGDU|5.0|This movie falls on my list of unusual war films like \\"Apocalypse Now\\" and \\"The Thin Red Line\\".  I enjoyed both of those films, and I think it's safe to say that if you enjoyed both of those \\"Jarhead\\" is worth checking out. <br /> <br />Visually this film is astounding.  The cinematography captures beautiful desert vistas, the horror of burning oil fields and black rain, and the endless flow of time.  Costumes, special effects and sound effects are also top notch, putting you in the period and in war itself.  I also enjoyed the music selections from the early 90's.  Not only did they fit the scenes, but they brought me back to those years.  The score was also noteworthy creating a kind of dreamlike ambient mood (much like the score from \\"The Thin Red Line\\") <br /> <br />The acting was excellent all around.  Jake Gyllenhaal has a difficult part, creating a soldier who has been trained to kill, and is not allowed to do his job.  Gyllenhaal lets his anger seethe, and boil under the surface.  We can almost taste his frustration, and feel bad for him.  At the same time he's a frightening figure; his intense need to kill almost coming across as psychotic.  Peter Sarsgaard is always good, bringing more depth to parts that seem to be surface only.  He gives Troy added dimensions.  His confrontation with the Major at the end of the film is expected and yet explosive at the same time.  Jamie Foxx turns in a good performance.  His part is by the book, but his charisma and skill make it memorable.  The supporting cast measures up just as well; but in the end this is Gyllenhaal's movie. <br /> <br />The script and direction are what will make or break this movie for viewers.  If you go in expecting a traditional war film, with plenty of action and heroics, you'll end up disappointed.  This movie takes a very personal view of a unique aspect of modern war.  It's a character study more than a war film.  It is more thematic than plot centric.  The theme is about frustration and boredom.  It takes guts to make a film about these topics, and Sam Mendes does the best he can.  In the end \\"Jarhead\\" is an excellent film, but not an enjoyable one.  It takes the right frame of mind to get into it and absorb it.  Those looking for action thrills will be disappointed.  Those looking for a meditation on one man's experience of the Gulf War will be rewarded.
B000NA77YO|5.0|no compilation ever satisfies everyone who is a fan of that groups music. It is even harder still to choose songs when that group's music doesn't rely on Am or Fm hits like Sabbath. Amazingly and pathetically, it has been decades since i heard a Black Sabbath song on the radio that wasn't Ironman or Paranoid. Even though there are only 3 studio albums to pick from, 4, if you believe Geezer Butler, who considers \\"Live Evil\\" 90% studio rerecorded(from the recent VH1 classic show, Hanging with Heaven & Hell), there is some room to screw up the best songs. I would have changed the following. I would include E5150 and go right into Mob Rules. The Mob Rules version from the Heavy Metal soundtrack is lame compared to the album version. For years, non-Ozzy Sabbath concerts had E5150 go into Neon Knights, which i have never understood. Use studio version of Children of the Sea; the live one sounds very muddy and loses any hint of light and shade that makes the original great. At all costs, you must have Sign of the Southern Cross. Remove \\"Falling off\\" as it is almost as long. Just like Heaven and Hell, \\"Signs\\" is the centerpiece of their second album and has to be on. Time Machine should also be on. If any time is left, put on the shortest Dio song from Live Evil, maybe Voodoo or Country Girl. Finally, i was a bit surprised by Lonely is the Word, but then i remembered i've seen several quotes from Iommi about \\"Lonely\\" being one of, if not the favorite/most proud of Sabbath song he's ever written. And he is \\"The Man\\". The 3 new songs are all good, sad to say much better than the Iommi/Hughes efforts of recent years. I think Dio and Iommi just have a certain magic together when writing.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I've been amused - ok, frustrated - by those rating this movie exclusively in relation to the previous movies. While a movie can be viewed in isolation, if there is an existing book reference I also like to gauge the film against the writer's intent. I read the Fleming books at the time of their first publication. This was a bit of a risk at the time as the sexuality was unusual for mainstream publications. In these jaded times there is nothing there that modern readers would find shocking. But, I digress. <br /> <br />The books painted James Bond as a flawed, sometimes unpleasant, person. His appearance was that of \\"every-man\\" so that he could easily blend in. The \\"suave\\" James Bond is much more a creation of the movies than the books. For the first time, in my opinion, a James Bond movie captured that character. James Bond is a \\"dangerous\\" person. After all, how many people who murder for a living are the kinds of folks you want to bring home to meet the kids. This version of Casino Royale (the 3rd - and I've  <br />experienced the pain of both previous filmed versions) strikes me as nearly perfect adaptation of a book with some action and a good deal of slowly building tension. <br /> <br />Another plus for the movie was the casting of support cast who looked like real people. Eva Green was superb in playing out the depth of her character without looking like a super-model (though she is attractive) <br />nor being handicapped with the limited acting skills so common in many previous Bond women. <br /> <br />Action based in reality was a real plus. I've long been frustrated by impossible action padded with gadgets that cannot exist. These items have always caused the suspension of disbelief to fail in prior Bond films. The action sequences were also well balanced with the slower, necessary expository scenes.  <br /> <br />The DVD itself was well mastered. I did find some scanning errors in the scene in the (sinking) Venice location, but otherwise the transfer looked <br />good. The audio was pretty typically mixed to British expectations. That is, center channel dialog was lower than one might expect. However, intelligibility was exceedingly good. The quality of the audio elements <br />was terrific and is among the best I've heard in the last 12 months. Playback for me is through a high end audio system (about $20,000) so your mileage may vary. <br /> <br />For me it is quite a relief to finally get a Bond film that is not just a few steps above the Flint films (\\"In Like Flint\\") but an involving story. I find this trend encouraging and hope it continues in this and other film material. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.

B000000QFV|5.0|Recently I bought both Eternal Idol and Dehumanizer.  I've already sold Dehumanizer and have been looking for a way to get rid of Idol.  I can't say they're bad albums.  A lot of people like Eternal Idol, especially, so it's probably worth checking out.  They both have awesome vocals throughout, no question about it, but even the great vocals didn't quite redeem the music for me.  And both CDs have things that I don't like about Black Sabbath in general.  First I think that Iommi, over the years and in a lot of the band's catalogue, tends to rely on the main riff of a song way too much.  You've got to have a great main riff, but you also need the song to stray from it sometimes, to have some time away from it to make the heart grow fonder (as they say!) for when you come back to it.  And I could listen to his lead guitar work forever, I love it, but his rhythms can sound unnatural and kind of jerk around sometimes.  I thought that both of these things came out enough to amount to pretty serious flaws in both albums I mentioned, which all came out in a five- or six-year period.  The songs often seemed out of balance and both albums overall had a distinctly constipated sound.    Black Sabbath is a band I want to like because when they're good they're great.  And everything comes together for me on TYR.  The heavy metal guitar sound was rich and powerful, and the different parts of the music were more developed and much better integrated.  Also the rhythms were appealing so I could completely enjoy the lead work that I love.  And the individual songs just had a lot more balance and uniqueness from each other, and never sounded forced.  It was a really pleasant surprise after those last two Sab CDs I tried, and I'm definitely keeping this.  And these differences were so obvious that I noticed them even though I just got TYR today and have only listened to it once.  Also, it's more helpful to have someone tell you that even if you're not a fan, like I'm not a fan per seof Black Sabbath, that a certain CD is worth looking into.  I find it meaningless when someone tells me that if I like a certain band that I have to get such and such an album of theirs.  When I'm a fan, I have to get ALL of the band's albums, even ones that aren't that good.  That's just what being a fan is all about, right?  With that said, the CDs by Black Sabbath that I own and feel--as a non-fan--are definitely worth looking into are Paranoid, Heaven and Hell, Mob Rules and this one.  And personally I'll probably stop here with my Black Sabbath collection.    Anyway, thanks for reading my tome review, and I hope it helped.  BTW - \\"TYR\\" is not an acronym.  It's the name of the son of the god Odin, as explained on the back cover of the CD--just so you don't wonder!
B000EHSVQE|3.0|Napoleon Dynamite does nothing new when it comes to plot - nerdy outcasts suffer through locker slammings, unpopularity, loneliness in the face of pretty, popular things only to find that - just you wait! There is a twist. This is probably one of the top five cliched plots in filmwriting school. However, it is worth seeing because of the original characters. Napoleon is the nerds nerd. He dozes through life not so much angst ridden as suffused with ennui. He accepts his lowly status - his lack of 'skills', the regular locker slammings, his rediculous family (such as his older, charisma free brother Chip who chats up 'babes' on the internet) and his lack of friends. His relations with girls are comically stilted 'I like your sleeves'. 'Thanks, I made them myself'. Eventually he finds salvation through his only two friends - monosyllabic Mexican Pedro, who is up against popular and pretty Summer for class president, and the erstwhile Debs, who is the classic beautiful ugly girl, if you catch my drift. The setting is also superbly quirky - dry, stifling rural Idaho complete with red barns and hick farmers who pay a dollar an hour for chicken relocation and reward their workers with raw egg shakes.<br /><br />The ending is predictable, in the 'School of Rock' mode, though do stay on after the credits for the 'real', hidden ending - I won't reveal, but it's the best scene of the movie!

B000ASATYO|5.0|This movie was alot of fun from start to finish. It was very brilliant and very humorous story. The commentary in the beginning of this movie by the director gives a little history about this movie and others about the special effects. A person just seeing this movie would not think about how much effort goes into a movie like this until you are told about it. Michael J. Fox gives an outstanding performance as the \\"paranormal researcher and exorcist\\". This is not a scarey horror movie, instead it is a very funny, alot of laughs kind of horror movie. I highly recommend this movie that really likes alot of fun in horror movies.

0451196716|5.0|The Long Walk is undoubtedly one of the best, and THE darkest novel I've read. I won't go on about the plot, the other reviewers do an excellent job of that. I have a warning of my own. This is not for the timid heart. There's not an excessive amount of gore, and it isn't really SCARY, but very disturbing. To think that 100 young, teenage boys would participate in a game like this isn't the disturbing part. It's when they have begun to tire and ask the \\"why\\" questions. The systematic breakdown of each boy, physically and mentally, makes your stomach feel quesy. One boy in particular, Olsen, had the most profound story to me. He enters the game with, apparently, all the confidence in the world, and as the Walk goes on, he becomes reduced to a walking corpse. He literally ages as the Walk goes on, and dies with a fraction of his mind left. The transition Olsen makes is heartbreaking. He, as well as the other 99 boys that are in the Walk, find out the horror they've walked into (no pun intended) too late, when death is the only forfeit adn relief. The heartlessness of the soldiers and the indifference of the Crowd make this book the darkest book I've ever read. 100 boys start, and 99 must die for there to be a winner. When broken of body and soul, no prize in the world can bring you back. Very intriging book, very original. I've never read anything like it, and I plan to buy all the Bachman books. The metaphorical analogies to life are all over this book, which makes it such a wonderful read.

B000J3OTSM|4.0|Its foundation may be shaped by a number of clich&eacute;s, but Step Up manages to rise above all of its individual parts and surpass expectations.  I'm not really a fan of the whole dance movie genre, but I really enjoyed this movie.  That being said, I would never have watched it had Jenna Dewan, the absolutely hottest female on the planet, not been in it.  Apparently, Channing Tatum represents some kind of eye candy for the female audience, as well - but all I know is that Jenna Dewan is a veritable goddess.<br /><br />Let's list some of those clich&eacute;s peppering this story: you've got your hip-hop hoodlum heading down the wrong path in life who gets an unexpected chance to do something worthwhile; your pretty, rich girl who takes a desperate chance with a guy from the other side of the tracks; their early friction but inevitable romance; and it's served up with a noticeable dash of a future gangster learning his lesson the hard way.  It all works out in a predictably cheesy conclusion, of course, but this film is too good to let cheesy endings and predictable storylines bring it down.  For some reason, everything about Step Up just works like a charm.<br /><br />Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum) is a wayward youth seemingly content to grow up as a real loser, spending most of his time hanging out with his equally carefree friends, jacking cars, and basically just being a juvenile delinquent.  After he's busted for trashing the auditorium at the Maryland School of Dance, though, he's sentenced to two hundred hours of community service there at the school.  His devil-may-care attitude doesn't win him any friends initially, but one talented young dancer, Nora Clark (Jenna Dewan) does take notice of the dancing skills she sees him displaying for his hoodlum friends.  After her dancing partner injures his foot and she can't find a suitable replacement, she reluctantly agrees to give Tyler a shot.  She's desperate because the big Fall Senior Showcase is coming up, and that represents her big chance of actually making it as a dancer after she graduates.  Obviously, it's not a smooth road ahead - getting Tyler to mimic her more formal moves, getting Tyler to show up to practice on time, etc.  Somewhere along the way, though, Tyler begins to have a new perspective on life and - for the first time ever - begins to dream of a better future.  His friends resent him for what he is doing, but that proves to be the least of his troubles.<br /><br />Step Up has a little bit of everything - it's way more than a mere excuse to watch some good dancing.  Most importantly, it starts with a story we've seen and heard before in numerous forms and takes it to new heights.  And every strand of that story ultimately culminates beautifully in the Senior Showcase.  Channing Tatum isn't going to win any awards for his brooding, uninspired acting, but that takes nothing away from the story.  For her part, Jenna Dewan is fantastic in every way.<br /><br />Finally, I just want to say that parents of young teenagers should have no qualms about letting their kids watch this movie.  I think the PG-13 rating hinges for the most part on a tragic event that takes place late in the film.  There is mild profanity, but there is no nudity whatsoever.  The only danger would be for pre-adolescent boys, as the mere sight of Jenna Dewan is more than capable of causing the immediate onset of puberty.  Seriously, though, this is a really good film that not only entertains, it also conveys a number of really important lessons about growing up in the real world, chasing your dreams, etc.resents her big chance of actually making it as a dancer after she graduates.

B000MQC9H4|3.0|Between the pairs Kate Winslet - Jack Black in L.A. and Cameron Diaz - Jude Law in U.K., I must say the L.A. pair was the more interesting to watch. Kate Winslet showed heart (kind to the elderly neighbour), taste  and intelligence with a longing for true love. Jack Black showed sense. And the big, spacious and ambient L.A. mansion surely helps a lot.     Cameron Diaz - Jude Law 's storyline in Surrey, on the other hand, appears to be shallow and unconvincing. The chemistry between Cameron and Jude seem to be non-existing. When they first met in the Surrey cottage, the way they giggled, conversed and the things they said were teenage stuff and predictable. No way could this be an indispensable and successful Hollywood trailer maker with a sharp sense. However, there were shots of the picturesque Surrey cottage that were simply postcard perfect. The movie could do a lot better if the story in Surrey is given more substance and heart.
B000MCIBE8|5.0|It's one of the most important,and influential,albums ever made.You owe it to yourself to get this album.Especially if you are into punk(They inspired the Stooges!)So in all ways,shapes,and forms you absolutely need this album..............Well get your a#% up and get it!
B000002ADT|3.0|I'm not really into jazz but I bought this cd after seeing it listed in a list of 100 cds you must own...so, basically I bought this cd to extend my musical listening [I've also bought other cds on various 'must have in your collection' lists...e.g. Patti Smith's \\"Horses\\", which I've reviewed here, and also Midnight Oils \\"10,...,1\\" cd, I think, which I didn't require a list to want to own it. Also reviewed that cd here].      I'd describe the music in this cd as low-key...suitable for unwinding, having a hot-bath to, or playing at at dinner-date or fancy restaurant. The first thing to note is that the cd I own made a special point on the back sleeve of saying it was the first version of the album that had the music played at the right speed...something about the original releases playing too fast when played back on vinyl. So, I suppose you should want to get the version played at the right speed.       The instruments on the cd are drums/cymbals, piano, trumpet, sax and double bass [I think]. It might also use some obscure instruments...not sure if I heard a washboard being played or not.      Many of the tracks feature an up-tempo cybal beat [perhaps in a three step beat as found in Queen's \\"We will rock you\\" song. The first track sounds vaguely familiar but I can't be sure of that.       Often you will hear a piano riff or double bass riff-by that I mean some simple note combinations...not unlike the cybals. From this back-drop you will hear various brass instrument solos-be it trumpet or sax. On occasion the piano will be the instrument playing the solo. It's these solos which convery the expression or emotion of the piece.      Track three has some really looooooooooong notes played by the trumpet. This may happen with other instruments in other songs too.      There may be some unintended distortion in the tracks, e.g. early on track two, the brass instruments sound distorted in the left channel. Track five has some distortion of the brass instruments onthe right channel. Since I listen to music with good quality headphones it may be less noticeable with speakers.      Another thing which I was unsure of was some of the drum sounds. I wasn't sure if I was hearing distortion or the drummer was playing the drums with a length of hair or some such-sounded like he was hitting the drums with hair and running the hair over the drums. Interesting in any case.      Probably because of the instruments used, I was expecting to hear some music that I'd heard in tv or movies - finally found out what track I have in mind: Herb Alpert \\"A taste of honey\\"...or maybe something like Dave Brubeck's \\"Take five\\". These tracks I think are classics and the kind of music that can really bump up an album in my estimation. In other words they're both good and memorable.      Anyway, I'm only giving this cd 3 stars because it didn't have a track that I particularly liked...a track which I would choose to listen to on its own, repeatedly. It's that kind of track which bumps up the ratings that I give to cds [just glance on my reviews to see that point illustrated].      Did read how this cd was very popular and motivated non-jazz listeners to buy it. If the cd had the kind of solos that I could get into [e.g. the guitar solo at the end of Pink Floyd's \\"Another brick in the wall\\" I would rate it higher, or if it contained a melody that I liked better-e.g. that tv or movie music that I mentioned before.      Not having listened to much jazz at all [this is my first jazz cd that I bought], I'd say that it isn't as demanding as jazz sometimes seems to be on the novice listener.      If you like \\"chill-out\\" music this cd will please. I can imagine playing this cd if I am trying to read and a neighbour or something is playing loud rock music which I want to drown out so that I can read undisturbed [sorry!].      This cd is very easy to listen to jazz.          Recommendations:        Can't say that I've wanted to explore jazz enough to find something that appeals to me a lot more, but jazzy stuff I am familiar with and like are:      US3 - Cantaloop. A jazz-pop, hip-hop song. Really cool. Only recently found out that the music borrows from...    Herbie Hancock - Cantaloupe Island. Checked it out once on You Tube after finding out US3 borrowed the hooky groove. Not bad. May even want to check out the album it comes off of.    The Dave Brubeck Quartet - Take five. Really catchy poppy jazz. Might want to check out the album that this came off of.    John Coltrane? - Not sure, but I was listening to some music progamme and they played some stuff by Coltrane, possibly...spoke to me more than \\"Kind of blue\\".          Even though I am not heavily into this album, the fact that I can instantly recongnise passages from it if I hear it, say, at an Apple store, speaks to the composition...can't say that the music is memorable, but I do know it when I hear it, if that makes sense.

He does an excellent job of motivating readers to make your hard earned dollars work for you. Stop putting your money in a savings account and start using it to make more money. His book was also an ice breaker to talk with other entrepreneurs about their ventures.

Though Horowitz's choice of vocabulary made this book seem easy on the surface, the plot and historical references made it appealing to very proficient readers. We are ready to read the next installment, Evil Star, and look forward to more Anthony Horowitz/Gatekeepers titles.
5551740323|5.0|I was the cover illustrator for the hardcover and first edition paperback of Tuf Voyaging. It was my break-in assignment from Jim Baen at TOR. And, as an avid science fiction reader for years, I couldn't believe my luck when I read the book in manuscript form. To this day it is one of my favorites. Haviland Tuf is one of the most distinctive characters in science fiction. As I read the stories, I kept thinking this would make a great film. I still think so today.<br /><br />I only wish they had let me do the cover design I wanted. It had dinosaurs. Read the book and you'll understand why. Instead, they wanted a more iconic design showing Haviland and the cats.<br /><br />I hope they bring this title back into print, because it's a classic. Seems like a no-brainer, given Martin's popularity today.

He has favorite parts, the animated 'singers' and the live children.  I appreciate that he is listening to Bach even though it may not be an actual symphony playing the music.  I know his mind is being stimulated.  My husband & I watch this with him and tell him what he is looking at to put words with the items.
B000G7PMD2|5.0|Simply put, this may be the best collaboration between a heavy metal rock band with an orchestra that has ever been recorded.  Separation of sound is very difficult to achieve when you are dealing with high volume but here the engineers manage to pull it off exceedingly well.  If you don't know about this group by now then this is as good an introduction as you will find.  If you are a fan then you will appreciate the excitement that the live audience adds to the band's performances even if you know most of the songs by heart.  If you can't appreciate how incredibly good these musicians are then you have my condolences.
0375831002|5.0|The story the Book Thief by Markus Zusak  was one of the best books I have read in a while. I base my liking to book on the physical and emotional reactions I engage upon throughout reading the story. While reading this story, there were times when I felt angry, like when Rudy gets bullied by the [...] youth Counselor, or sad, when it is discovered how everyone that is important to Liesel leaves her. I loved how the book was told by Death, and the emotional attachment shown by the Death for the main characters and the others around her.     This story is about a German [...]girl who is given up by her mother to foster parents during WWII. The narrator of this story is Death, an interesting spin on storytelling. The story starts off telling explaining the journey Leisel and her mother and brother are off too, when her younger brother dies.  After dealing with death of her younger brother and the adjustment of a new family, Leisel makes friends with neighbor boy whom is named Rudy. She also becomes very close with her \\"Poppa\\" as she calls him, while dutifully obeys her fouled mouth mother.  Years past and a favor is repaid by Leisel's foster father. A young Jewish man, whose father fought with Leisel's Poppa in a war and actually saved his life, is need of a hiding place during the round up of Jewish citizens during the 1940's tragedy. The Young Jewish boy named Max comes to live in the family's basement. The family bonds with Max. He and Leisel become attached to each other and learn many things from one another. All is well until he has to be sent away for fear of being caught for something Poppa does.  The story continues with the effects of war and destruction it causes and the path of a little girl trying to find herself.    For me this book was amazing as I said before. It was a different twist on a Holocaust story. I am so used to reading Holocaust survival stories like Night by Elie Wiesel or Maus by Art Speigelman, where the point of view is that of a JewishMan. I thought the war told from Death's point of view and also that of a German's up bringing was brilliant. The sad aspect of this tragic event was not lost from the opposing view point. If anything I think it was drawn upon more with the Max's and Leisel's forbidden relationship. I also enjoyed the fact the author included the facts of WWII, and opened eyes while doing so. In the midst of survivor/horror stories of the Holocaust we tend to get lost in the grief of the Jewish. In this book, it opens eyes to how many German's suffered as well. A lot of German business men relied on their Jewish customers for income, and when they were taken away, everyone suffered. I think it is important to get the two sides of the story. And although this is a fictional story I feel it mirrored the time correctly. For me now I have both sides of the story.
B0002858YS|5.0|Love this band. They bring back the sound of the 80's but put a great and awesome spin on it. Some songs also have an original indie rock pop sound to it. Get this album, you will not be dissapointed.
B000O68Q88|1.0|One size does not fit all. While the benefits of hugging have been proven and documented, there is the very real flip side of misapplied hugs and unwanted hugs.<br /><br />Dr. Welch has banged on the drum for years about what she calls \\"holding time,\\" but there are the very real needs of those for whom this treatment is undesirable. For example, many people with autism dislike hugs/holding because of a) the sensory onslaught, e.g. body and/or perfume odors; b) hugs can be too tight and therefore unpleasant and c) in many cases involving severely autistic individuals, hugs are often viewed as punitive restraint.<br /><br />Another thing that bothers me about this is Dr. Welch has long advocated this \\"holding time,\\" but scant attention has been paid to the downside this can have. In Catherine Maurice's book, \\"Let Me Hear Your Voice,\\" she chronicles the problems with this method. In many instances, children as young as pre-school age were brought in for \\"holding,\\" all the while being shouted at and told how they [the children] placed unreasonable demands; wanted their way (who doesn't) and, in effect were hurting the family. That kind of thing made me want to run for cover! The premise of this being to choreograph anger (the parents were actually TOLD to be angry at their children and scream these kinds of things at them), all the while inflicting these restrictive hugs.<br /><br />Welch's method smacks of quackery to me. I was also repelled by people following the order to lick their children like dogs do their pups. Welch, along with the Tinbergens and Bettelheim claim that restraint and unnatural hugs will \\"cure\\" autism. That most emphatically is not true! Being autistic has nothing to do with unresolved issues in a parent/caretaker-child relationship. Autism is a neurobiological condition. All the enforced hugs in the world won't cure autism. The enforced hugs were bad enough, but in some cases, Dr. Welch had people \\"straitjacketing\\" their children by rolling them up firmly in blankets, further restraining them. That sounded atrocious and appalling to me. To add insult to injury, she all but blames parents for causing their children to have autism! Her \\"followers\\" sound like they've been sold a bill of goods. Since there is no scientific evidence to support Welch's claims, the whole concept seems very dubious to me.<br /><br />I knew a boy who survived this treatment and hated it. He would say, \\"no more hug,\\" \\"hate hug\\" and \\"Not there! [to the place where this treatment was dispensed] No more yell and no more hug.\\" To him, hugs were \\"when you get yelled at when you're not bad,\\" and to this day he avoids hugs. Imagine explaining to well intentioned relatives why a child tries avoid being hugged. At 10, the boy said he'd rather have been spanked than subjected to this treatment. Now, nearing adulthood, he says, \\"I'm still autistic. I still like to study weather patterns. I'm still an expert on jeeps and military planes and I still hate hugs.\\"<br /><br />As a survivor of enforced hugging, I can say that it was not for me and backfired - instead of resolving anything, it turned me off to hugs all the more. To this day, the very thought of enduring this dreadful treatment repels me. I found it punitive and abhorred it. Who wants to be yelled at and told to look at somebody while being subdued by force?! Who wants to be the recipient of false accusations with no recourse or defense?! Who would want to be forced to sit with someone and endure hugs to appease others?! It is the neurotypical (NT) population who got their way and at the expense of the clients!<br /><br />Enforced hugging does NOT engender love - it often impresses me as being a staged tableau designed to meet everybody else's needs at the expense of the client being forced to endure it. Yelling at people and hurling accusations does not sound like loving resolution to me. Donna Williams' brilliant work, \\"Autism: An Inside-Out Approach\\" addresses this very real issue and said that enforced hugs only teach the lesson of \\"give the desired response.\\" The videos of these \\"holding\\" sessions seem to depict just that - enduring hugs under the most adverse of conditions, replete with accusations and yelling. People with autism (this treatment was directed primarily at the autistic population) usually have acute hearing, so yelling can be especially painful. Subjecting pre-schoolers, some of whom are nonverbal to this kind of treatment is something I find atrocious and appalling. I would never wish this form of treatment on anyone.<br /><br />If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a quack...er, duck. I think this MIStreatment reeks of quackery and the picture on the cover is simply a stock photo - there is no proof that it is of a child with autism who has survived this treatment with flying colors.<br /><br />In fact, I think this method and this book are for the birds. The very expression \\"for the birds\\" came about from birds pecking at seeds horses passed into their manure. \\"For the birds\\" means of minimal value and from a very questionable source indeed.es this very real issue and said that enforced hugs only teach the lesson of \\"give the desired response.\\" The videos of these \\"holding\\" sessions seem to depict just that - enduring hugs under the most adverse of conditions, replete with accusations and yelling.

In some ways it is more of a documentary than anything but there is still quite a bit of good music especially at the end when they jam together.

B0000028PI|5.0|This is my fave Alice album. And that's saying something, since I can't get enough of any of his albums (except Constrictor.) <br />I find the storytelling here much like the late Gabriel-led Genesis (i.e. Foxtrot). It takes the listener on an eerie, ethereal journey which turns Steven's life into a nightmarish carousel of doom. The story is hard to decipher, but the themes are huge and carry the impact of the album. All the songs are different styles of hard rock, except for the exceptional ballad \\"It's Me.\\" These aren't just any hard rock songs, though - AC as usual redefines the rules of crafting a great hard rock songs, and comes up with some of the catchiest rock melodies of the 90s. The album is definitely an \\"experience\\" album; it has the greatest effect on you when you listen to it all at once. The first time I heard it, it took my breath away; every song besides Nothing's Free and Unholy War are rock masterpieces in themselves! <br />Cooper clearly poured all of his 90s effort and creativity into this adreniline-pumping start to his morality trilogy, and it succeeds completely. Buy it now! <br />My only problem with it is the cover; I find it lacking for a cooper album. Sure, it's psychotic, but I wish they would have captured all of Cooper's evilness like usual. :D

B00000K3D4|5.0|I loved it. It was amazing the way it was planed to be. The late Jim Henson would be proud of an achievement that he thought that could not be done, it was and always be there as a movie that all would watch again and over again 1,00 times. The talent of the puppeteers, Bowie and Miss Connelly made it memorable because of Jim Henson's awesome conceptual design and story line. I saw it on television in 1990 because I was born in 1986 ( the year it made  it to the show house. I bought the movie in March of 2005 and watched it once per day since then. My sister loved this movie as well. My dad thought I was a geek for loving the movie, oh well, we have our own hobbies. I JUST LOVED THIS MOVIE
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|I first saw this movie as a child, age 8, and ever since I have loved this movie, for the most important fact that it is a darker, and more interesting, adaptation of the Oz story. The dark side of this movie may scare children, as it did myself, but it is not overwhelming or too extreme. In fact, this movie strikes a fine and perfect balance on the darker elements, so that a typical child, over the age of 6 or so, will be scared in a good way. This is because the darker sides of this film are represented by things that children really should watch out for in real life, such as stranger adults, and the temptations to wander to far off from home. The characters are unique and original, and the set designs are a visual treat. This movie is a must see for people who want more substance than the overrated sappy 'The Wizard of Oz' movie with the pathetically timid Judy Garland. In this movie, Fairuza Balk plays a much stronger and compelling Dorothy, who we can respect and believe in.  Overall, this movie is far better than any other Oz movie in terms of its dedication to the original books.
0060763280|5.0|I got this book awhile back because a friend recommended it. Harv is good at getting your mind racing. It's just as good as Matt Bacak's book called: [[ASIN:1600370527 Secrets of the Internet Millionaire Mind]] but Harvs book is more general focused.
B000MV8AE0|4.0|There are many things to be said in favor of director Agnieszka Holland's ('Europa, Europa', 'Total Eclipse', 'The Secret Garden', 'Olivier, Olivier') COPYING BEETHOVEN as written from fragments of questionable truths about the composer's final years by Stephen J. Rivele and Christopher Wilkinson: the film is gorgeous to look at for all its candlelit sepia scenes and of course a pleasure to hear as the musical score is primarily excerpts of Beethoven's music, and for the towering performance of Ed Harris as the deaf, dirty, cruel, grumpy, gross Ludwig van Beethoven.  There have been sufficient biographies of the master to set the facts straight and this particular viewer has no problem at all with the tinkering of truth in creating a cinematic story that might help to explain the idiosyncrasies of the old master composers.  It is a movie to enjoy: it is not a true story for all its attempts to recreate the life of the composer.<br /><br />In COPYING BEETHOVEN the premise is that the 'hard of hearing' Beethoven needs a copyist to help him complete his Symphony No. 9 due to a premiere of the work in four days time. Wenzel Schlemmer (Ralph Riach), Beethoven's usual copyist, is dying of cancer and arranges for the best pupil at the academy to assist Beethoven.  That pupil happens to be a female, one Anna Holtz (Diane Kruger), who arrives at Beethoven's filthy apartment and struggles to convince the composer that she is worthy of the task.  Anna is in love with a bridge builder Martin Bauer (Matthew Goode) and finds herself devoting her mind and attention to Beethoven rather than to Martin.  Beethoven has never married and instead is in love with his nephew Karl (Joe Anderson) who refuses to follow his uncle's footsteps and instead mistreats him by constantly begging/stealing money form him to pay his gambling debts.  So with this cast of characters Beethoven proceeds to complete his now famous 9th Symphony with Anna's help.  Beethoven is to conduct the premiere but must depend on Anna (substituting for the errant Karl) to sit in the orchestra and give him cues.  The performance is of course greeted with rapture, but Beethoven knows his output is not finished and the remainder of the film deals with his struggle to write the Grosse Fugue for his final string quartet, a piece the public (including Anna) loathes but one that Beethoven recognizes as the bridge to the next advance in music writing. Reduced to self pity, Beethoven dies, but Anna is going to carry the torch for her hero...<br /><br />The problems with watching COPYING BEETHOVEN that will make those who know the facts of the composer's life stumble are many: Beethoven was completely deaf in his latter years, unable to hear his music much less conversations with people; Beethoven did not conduct the premiere of his 9th Symphony but instead sat deafly in the orchestra not even able to hear the score at which he stared; the gentility with which Ed Harris' Beethoven shows is in sharp contrast to the rascally and despicable behavior of the real man.  But those facts don't lend themselves to a good story for cinema and the writers and director were wise to realize this.  So forgive the straying from the truth and settle back for a very entertaining if factually irresponsible 'biography'. The musical portions of the film are so truncated that the music suffers, but that matters little to the impression Beethoven's 9th, even in soundbites, has on audiences.  If for no other reason, see this film for the bravura performance by Ed Harris.  Grady Harp, April 07st depend on Anna (substituting for the errant Karl) to sit in the orchestra and give him cues.

B000NA28HU|1.0|Do Not Buy This Movie!!!!!!!!!!  <br /> <br />It is so far from the book that it might be a different story altogether!  <br /> <br />Please RENT it first, then decide. I really wish I could return mine!!!   <br />   <br />
074356619X|5.0|An excellent book, you have to read it to understand but it can be life changing. Gives lots of practical advice and then gives a new way of thinking about... well everything. A must read.
0374105235|5.0|An incredible account; a story from a survivor that had to be told but is so disturbing you won't be able to sleep comfortably at night. You'll look at your daily comforts and assumptions of safety in a new way, and realize that we can save each other, one by one, if we only reach our hands out and try.
B000BTGY1O|5.0|This movie is great!!  I love Audrey.  If you want romantic, get this movie.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|This is the story of one of the truly great men in history, told remarkably well by a great Director, and played by one of the great actors of our times.  The film is extraordinary in every respect; great subject, great story, great acting, great cinematography and great message. <br />Ghandi is easily one of the top ten greatest films of the past 25 years.
B00005JKJA|5.0|David Lynch's 2001 'Mulholland Drive' is a mind-boggling journey that will definitely need to be watched several times to fulfill what he set out to create.  The film plays with the spectator's expectations for we are presented with an alluring yet innocent Hollywood murder-mystery. However, the roots of Lynch's fantasy are much deeper then what is revealed at first, as we have seen with Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks.  The colours and overall look of the film are topnotch, as are performances from its great cast: Naomi Watts, Justin Theroux and Laura Harring.  However, the DVD does not provide us with anything that let's us into the mind of Lynch, but it is still a great film to own and watch over and over.
B000LPQ6DE|3.0|Although this adaptaion has beautiful cinematography and the acting is first rate, I have to give this film 3 stars based on the script.  While I make a general point of not being one of those \\"purists\\" only loyal to the book, I felt this representation was a far shot from the Jane Eyre Bronte so carefully developed.   I was shocked that Jane's feisty, intelligent personality was completely ignored (except for the vague hint we get of it at the old tree).  While true to the book in some respects of the character such as being plain and simple, we never see this Jane intellectually spar with Rochester, we never see her call him on his self-serving interpretation of love and religion, we never see her draw him out of his pining, we didn't even get to hear her tell off Mrs. Reed Jane-style!! Basically, this movie has it's moments, but it gets three stars from me because I hardly recognized this mousey, over-compliant version of Jane. Just a NOTE TO PARENTS, if you did not get a sense from other reviews, this is not a version for children.  It's pretty sensual and there is a brief flashback-type sex scene when Rochester is reflecting on the behavior of Bertha Mason.
B000065BPB|5.0|First of all, the first thing that came to my mind when i saw them was \\"They are HUGE\\". I've been using earbuds nearly all my life and this is the first time i got a pair of cans. These things are massive, definitely not for travelling.  <br /> <br />Having said that, the quality of the music is amazing. The bass sounds good, it's not overpowering and some of my hip hop songs with heavy bass sound really nice. Noise cancelling is the real deal, i snap my fingers right next to my ears and i can't hear them. I can't hear speech, no more nagging to listen to! <br /> <br />The only gripe i have is they squeeze my head some. It gets a little uncomfortable after a half hour but i suppose i just need to get used to them. Overall, highly recommend these to anyone.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|A very pleasant surprise, The Holiday, is a romantic comedy that brings to the screen the parallel stories of two young women who travel to each other's countries to get over their troubles with the men in their lives only to find true love.   <br />The Holiday is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.   <br />Cameron Diaz, Jude Law, Kate Winslet, Jack Black and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention a few tears.   <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the MUSIC (!!!) are all wonderful! <br />In short, The Holiday is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  4 1/2 Stars <br />
B000MG1YC0|2.0|I loved the first two Sirenia albums for their diversity.  Screams, growls, whispers, clean vocals, female vocals, choirs, you name it - it was there.<br /><br />Now the songs are less complex, more repetitious, and (gasp) \\"radio-friendly\\" with pop-style female vocals and Morten's vocals appearing on only three songs.<br /><br />Ouch!  Not exactly what we long-time fans were expecting!!  If the goal was to become a more accessible, female fronted band...then I suppose Morten succeeded.  However this is not going to thrill everyone who has been listening since Tristania.  Speaking of them, Illumination was surprisingly more creative than this album.<br /><br />I hope Sirenia goes back to its old, diverse and exciting ways.  The first two albums were in my stereo for a consistent six months or longer.  I haven't even been able to listen to this one even six times.  A \\"Downfall\\" for now...but perhaps if enough of us speak out, we'll get a stronger fourth album.  (fingers crossed)
B000N3SRRC|4.0|The cd has been in my player long enough to write a review (takes a minimum of 20 spins).  Clutch has reached the point that each cd it releases is compared against the previous catalogue.  This disc is not as good as their best (Blast Tyrant and Pure Rock Fury in my opinion), but is still a very good disc.   <br /> <br />Although some have mentioned that this cd veers toward southern rock, I don't think this is southern rock, but is instead strongly influenced by music from the south.  To that end, the best songs on this disc are those that wear the southern influences on their sleeves.  Electric Worry and Mr. Shiny Cadillackness are absolute standouts.  Some of the best songs Clutch has ever put out.  Black Umbrella, Opposum Minister, White's Ferry, When Vegans Attack, and Devil & Me are also near the top.  The Rapture of Riddley Walker gets lost a bit, having to follow Electric Worry.  Can't Stop Progress and Power Player are very good songs, but do not open the cd very strongly.  Child of the City is a solid metal type song. Although it starts with cliched metal lyrics, but recovers nicely after that. <br /> <br />Now for the one major complaint.  The lyrics on this cd are very good.  However, Neil's voice is often placed too far in the background.  One of the great things on previous records has been Neil's powerful voice, front and center.  On this disc, his voice is sometimes muted, sometimes allowing the repetitiveness of the guitar to become very noticeable. <br /> <br />Clutch is becoming a discovered band, and it is about time.  These guys are good.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|Another great piece of work. I listen to Enigma during my work hours on my zune. Talk about being in harmony with what you are doing. Before I know it the day is over. So I go home and listem to Enigma while surfing the net or palying on line games. It just doesn't get any better than this!
B000055Y0X|5.0|Dr. Strangelove, like most black comedy, finds its humor in the fact that there is really very little humor to be found in the situation it presents. <br /> <br />Mankind, in trying to secure peace (through Mutally Assured Destruction-type nuclear deterrence), manages to completely bungle every step, accidentally dropping a hydrogen bomb and causing the triggering of a Doomsday Device which will force us to live in caves for a hundred years. <br /> <br />What's funny about that? Nothing. And, of course, everything. <br /> <br />The funny thing about it is that it's so true--humanity really is that inept and bumbling; we really could \\"oops\\" our way into a nuclear winter--and we're left with the options of laugh about it or give up in despair. Movies like Dr. Strangelove allow us to see the ridiculousness that we continually create and \\"find the funny\\" rather than anguish. <br /> <br />Specifically, we're shown the hyper-paranoid mentality of the Cold War, with all of its suffocating rules and fail-safes (with the eventual result that no one is able to call back the planes sent to bomb Russia, because no one has the proper authorization). Hilariously, though, we're shown that the paranoia has a *basis*, as the Russian Ambassador snaps spy-photos of \\"the Big Board\\" when the Doomsday Device has already been triggered and surely such espionage has lost all meaning. We're shown how our well-meaning public officials (represented by the President) are at the mercy of testosterone-fueled, cereberally-challenged Generals and insane scientists culled from Hitler's government (with the Nazi inside always threatening to come out). <br /> <br />Dr. Strangelove, amidst the backdrop of the Cold War and nuclear arms race, shows how humanity, in everything it does or tries to do, always manages to muck things up in the most hideously, and appropriately, ironic of ways. (\\"Peace Is Our Profession\\" read the signs of the Air Force Base, as the gunfire rings out and the bombers fly towards their targets.) Dr. Strangelove tells us to accept all of this, smile, and \\"stop worrying.\\" <br /> <br />Beyond the general purpose of black comedy, and Dr. Strangelove's particular topic, this is a wonderful film. Brilliantly acted, brilliantly directed. Peter Sellers is, as you think he might be, a stand-out, wonderful in all three of his roles (and the first two times I watched this movie, I couldn't even tell that all three were the same man), and so is George C. Scott and the rest of the supporting cast. <br /> <br />This is my favorite of Kubrick's collection and my favorite black comedy. <br /> <br />As one final note for this five-star comedy, I wonder if Dr. Strangelove will, over time, lose its appeal to the newer generations. They will not have grown up during the Cold War, and they will have missed out on that era's particular fear of and obsession with The Bomb. Perhaps, if Dr. Strangelove loses its relevance and appeal to succeeding generations, that will be a good thing and signal progress? We can only hope for the best.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|The Story is a great followup to the band's major label debut. Brandi has one of the greatest voices I have ever heard and this album will launch her and the band to new heights. The rerecordings of some of Brandi's earlier work by T Bone Burnett are a great improvement over the earlier recordings and will give the songs a well deserved wider audience.  I was hoping the song \\"Over You\\" would be included on this one but there are plenty of gems here. Downpour and Jospehine are especially good. <br /> <br />Thanks for coming to Northampton MA. Can't wait for the show. I'm bringing 3 generations of the family along.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|What a remarkable treasure this recording is. I remember sitting in Massey Hall as this unfolded and coming to the realization, that for all his eccentricities, when stripped back down to the seentials, Young is one of the most powerful songwriters in North American music. These songs were what rightfully established his reputation, and from the opening bars of \\"On The Way Home,\\" it is clear that Young has respectfully mastered the recording so that all these years later, it packs the same emotional punch as it did in the hallowed TO hall.  <br />Massey brought out the best in a lot of performers - Gordon Lightfoot and BRuce Cockburn have seminal outstanding live discs from this venue. For Young, this was a very big homecoming as it launched the next phase of his career, post Crazy Horse and post CSNY. David Briggs had wanted Young to release this instead of HARVEST. I'd have to agree in principle, especially because the HARVEST songs are su much better here than they were on H. \\"A Man Needs a Maid\\" and \\"There's A World\\" are infinitely more powerful without the LSO strings - an unforgiveable lapse of aesthetic taste. \\"World\\" isn't really a very good song anyway, and I'd have preferred the 10 minute self-effacing pillory he does of \\"Sugar Mountain\\" from the companion bootlegs to this tune, but still, it holds up better solo acoustically. \\"Maid\\" resonates in a way that it never did on HARVEST. The fact that Young was visibly struggling with spinal pain, encased in a brace under his flannel shirt, made the performance all the more harrowing. <br />\\"Bad Fog\\" also comes across more effectively here than on the RED ROCKS Live CD & DVD (nee Friends and Family). Just does. Seems less contrived. \\"Cowgirl In The Sand\\" and \\"Down By THe River\\" are even better here than on EVERYBODY KNOWS, no small feat. \\"See The Girl Dance\\" brings it all to a raucous conclusion. It was a triumphant return to his hometown, and Young delivered a performance that still resonates with power and emotion all these years later. <br />I would encourage you to get the version withe DVD- Young did a great job assembling what footage he had of the concert and intercutting it with archival home film. It's especially effective. There is also the clips from the Johnyy Cash show on this disc, and it was those clips that launched Young to the forefront of American rock music writers and singers - no longer the quirky or enigmatic odd-man out of Buffalo Springfield or CSNY, Young grabbed a calculating moment to announce his strengths, and again, the performances are rivetting. The quality of the sound throughout is superb. <br />ARCHIVES ONE is due (persumably) in November. I'd love to see a release of JOURNEY THROUGH THE PAST on DVD, but that's expecting to fly a little too much. That film had a number of dream like and Jungian arche-typal montages that also telegraphed quite a bit about Young and his direction. The film also includes \\"Soldier\\", one of Young's strongest philosophical statements, and an astute political observation by David Crosby that is even more disarmingly to the point today than it was in the Nixon years. It would be a timely reminder of values lost to fascism, especially as practiced these days. For now, the brilliance of this release will live a long time in my memory. Thanks, Neil.

0060589469|5.0|ZMM is a milestone work of contemporary philosophy.  The metaphors in the book bridge the perceived dichotomy between science and nature.  The necessity of embracing technology (metaphor: the bike and keeping it in shape) in order to experience the natural (the journey, sites, experiences, etc.) helps Pirsig make the point that nature and science are inextricably intertwined.  This is particularly valid in today's polarized society, and helps make the book as valid as it was when I first read it 15 years ago.<br /><br />One thing I noticed this time around that is more amusing than anything, is the touch of arrogance Pirsig has about the concepts his pre-insanity persona had.  He discusses Phaedrus' views on Quality as some kind of philisophical breakthrough, with only mention of one philosopher who even touched on his views (Poincare).  I'm no philosophical genius, but the whole field of existentialism is full of thinkers who talk about essentially the same stuff, but just use different terminology.<br /><br />Thats pretty nit-picky though, because all in all ZMM is a great book.  If you are new to philosophy, don't expect any answers or solutions, but just neat ideas that make you think
B00004RF8J|5.0|I'm not crazy about musicals, but if the music's right and the story's tight, then I can be sold.  I fell in love with this movie when I first saw it and I still love it today.

1400103282|5.0|Compared to other people in the computer industry such as his partner Steve Jobs or Bill Gates, Wozniak is a quiet introverted engineer. He also seems a lot less driven to a success that would in reality gain him nothing more. There have been stories floating around the industry about pranks he has pulled but nothing definite. Indeed the name of the book 'iWoz' is a play on Apple's iPod, iTunes and other 'i' products. He's kept his sense of humor.  <br /> <br />Now we have the story from the Woz himself. (To be sure, co-authored with Gina Smith.) He relates stories about the early days of the personal computer industry and the break throughs in technology that he (primarily) created. The basic concepts of the PC as we know it: interface with a keyboard and screen, few switches, floppy disk, expansion cards -- All came from Woz.  <br /> <br />This book is likely to become an important research source in the future as it is a primary original source.  <br /> <br />Patrick Lawlor who read the book for the audio has the ability to keep it moving and interesting through the entire 9 hours.
0805047905|1.0|My 12 month old daughter loves books and I have been reading to her since she was 3 months old. She has a wide variety of books and enjoys almost all. However, this book has just not grabbed her attention even after several attempts - never happened with any other of her books. It's very monotonous and the illustrations are horrible. I kept wondering what the big deal was about this book until I read a teacher's review - apparently the current version is not the original one, which was the real classic where children had to actually guess what the character was seeing based on the picture.

This is a light read and definitely time well wasted.

B00006LLNU|3.0|I hope I am not the first person to ask this question. I mean seriously. What is all the hype about? This is not new or innovative. Slowdive, telefon aviv and tangerine dream fooled around with this angle a decade back.<br /><br />Emotional? Please. Ulrich is classier in his sleep but if he is too \\"techno\\" for you what about Deja Etandu or Super furry animals or bomb the bass? It also kind of irks me how this record borrows heavily from krautrock and the shoegazing genre with a leniency towards Slowdive.<br /><br />Sorry. It is not a bad record. I've just heard better that's all. The records I've heard are good enough to ruin this album for me.<br /><br />Oh yeah. And the not IDing the track gimmick? It gets old guys. Zeppelin pulled the same stunt and so do a lot of artists these days. I actually found the track IDs  online and their translations. Yeeash. Talk about a mediocre emotionally misdirected premise. Its okay I guess. I hear Brad Pitt and Madonna dig it... Let me save you some cognitive dissonance and make a suggestion; they might simply have bad taste in music<br /><br />Fairly recommended.

B000NA77YO|4.0|As a kid in the late '80s and early '90s I became a big Black Sabbath fan, but I was one who viewed the Dio-led incarnation of Sabbath as second to the original version.  As I have grown older, however, I have come to assign them each the same level of esteem, although they are different, to be sure.  I have always equated the Ozzy vs. Dio comparison to that of a Dave vs. Sammy for Van Halen; a better \\"personality\\" replaced a better singer.<br /><br />Sabbath fans can (and will) quibble about the songs that were excluded from this single disc (personally, I would have liked to have seen \\"The Sign Of The Southern Cross\\", an all-time Sabbath masterpiece, included), but if you want a pared-down sampling of the Dio era, this is a good choice.  The three new songs are very good, but in my opinion unequal to the older material.  Ronnie James Dio, at age 64, can still bring it, and the band sounds tight.  All in all I would liked to have had a \\"Black Box 2\\" including everything they did with RJD, but oh, well.  A good introduction for someone who is unfamiliar with \\"the Dio years\\".
B000MXPE7O|2.0|After watching BLOOD DIAMOND, this was really a \\"sleeper\\" for me. Maybe its a typical \\"guy movie\\" but all I know is, I kept falling asleep. I would never watch it again, nor buy it. How it got those great ratings, I'll never know.  I loved this guy in the BOURNE movies, because they had action. It also threw me with all the accents and names, and the low tone of their voices making it hard to hear. I think his life had to be hell to live like that, but then he seemed to really enjoyed it.
B00005J9M3|2.0|I just picked up this 2CD \\"remastered\\" edition and although the packaging and the bonus CD with mixes/b-sides/rarities are top notch, the new mastering job is awful. Being a long-time PSB fan, I've owned the original edition of 'Behavior' (I.E. not remastered) for years and I've always thought that it, along with all the other albums, were very well produced and sounded just superb---and I still do. Unfortunately this edition's sound quality is notably inferior when you do a direct comparison to the original release. As with most music production today, this release has been highly compressed (louder overall volume at the cost of sound quality) which has resulted in a lackluster presentation.      In conclusion, if you're buying this edition for the extra mixes (yes, they really are great!) and are not too picky about audio quality, you'll be more than satisfied. If, on the other hand, you're buying it for the so-called 'remastering', move on and pick up he original release, it sounds far better.
B000127LW2|4.0|STV is and always will be my favorite of the star trek line. I think the box set is definately worth the time to watch and the money to buy...IF bought used on amazon....I agree with the other reveiwers that the new price is utterly insane. I am a trekker to the heart, who taped near every episode as they aired new and even I wouldn't consider paying 100 or more dollars a season!!!!  The packaging is a little shoddy but the discs themselves make up for it. I really liked the special features. It was interesting to watch the auditions and  the footage of the orignal *gulp* *gasp* * hidious face made* \\"almost\\" Janeway.... <br />TPTB definately got it right when they hired kate mulgrew.  <br />Great show....Great season !!!

His style of writing is easy to read while being informative about the political process necessary to get anything done.

B000H2N6GQ|2.0|Tom Clancy is at his best when describing military weapons systems and tactics. He does less well with his human characters who seem real enough during their missions, but become two dimensional when the action stops. The magic of a good book is that the characters come to life. Unfortunately, in Rainbow Six they never really do, and so I never really cared what happened to them. More disturbing is the amoral tone of the book. Tom Clancy takes the position that counter-terrorism teams have to crossover to the dark side in the service of the good.  This seemed supportable until the final mission where I felt the \\"good guys\\" lost their humanity.  If you give up the moral high ground and sink to the level of terrorists are you really any better then they are?
B00005Y6YB|5.0|This is a great movie. Life was hard back then but people just did what they had to do and didn't make a big deal of it. The people who played in this movie did a wonderful job and all were believable.
B000093BDX|5.0|I ordered this CD to play at work.  It's fun to see customers singing and dancing while waiting in line, and music helps the time to pass faster.  There are a lot of songs on this one, so it doesn't get boring.  We especially dig a French Bikini on a wild alley goat by a palm tree in the sand.
B000NA2776|5.0|Ok I'm probably not the target audience for this CD...if there even is one.  I never really listened to Queen or any of the other people MIKA has been compared to, but I was hooked from the first time I heard Grace Kelly on the radio, and I bought the CD as soon as it came out. <br /> <br />It's probably the happiest saddest CD that I own which makes me love it more.  MIKA deals with so many issues in his songs and presents them in such an amazing way.  The part of you that may not want to like a song for whatever reason always loses to the part of you that just can't help loving it. <br /> <br />So yeah, MIKA has got a great voice, his songs are catchy and you'll have a blast singing along, the instrumentals are awesome, and to top it off the lyrics are fun yet serious and meaningful.  All together it makes an amazing album.

0393324818|4.0|I just finished reading Moneyball for the first time. I was generally impressed, and a lot of the ideas about baseball seem to be fairly on target, but I think they need to stand the test of time before we can accept them as unquestionably valid. We're not there yet.  <br /> <br />Anyway, I was curious about how a lot of the players mentioned in the book fared in Major League Baseball, and checked out the stats on many of them. Now there is one part of the book where Ray Durham (A's second baseman) is taking batting practice while coaches Ron Washington and Thad Bosley are chatting behind the cage, obviously with our author Michael Lewis nearby and listening in too. Now \\"Wash\\" and \\"Boz\\" mention that they each got lots of stolen bases in their careers. Wash claims to have gotten 50 or so one year (my memory's vague on this detail as I write this) and Bosley acknowledged when Wash said that Boz got 90 one season. Durham is shocked by this. While I read it, I took it as fact. If you take the time to look it up, you'll see that they're  obviously having an inside joke at someone's expense, either Durham's, Lewis' or both.  <br /> <br />Wash played 12 yrs, almost all as a utility infielder. He had as many as a total of 10 stolen bases in only one season, never made double digits in any other year. Ron Washington did not play on the speedy Royals in the 70s. His first season was '78 with the Dodgers, then he went down to the minors again until he was back up with the Twins in '81. Looks like he started in 82 and or 83, that's it.  <br /> <br />Bosley's top steal total was 12 in '78 with the White Sox. He usually didn't even get 90 ab's in a year. Utility outfielder for every one of his seasons in the majors.  <br /> <br />Now it didn't seem to me that Lewis was presenting this info as if he was in on the joke. I wonder what anyone else's impression was, if they seemed to sense any irony on his part. It would be a bit embarrassing if Lewis printed this without fact checking it, especially when he's as irreverent  as he is toward his targets (scouts, baseball management/establishment) for basically not bothering to check real facts (statistics). It's at least as important for a non-fiction writer to be checking his facts as for a baseball general manager.   <br /> <br />I also took some time to dig up stats on the A's 2002 draftees. Nick Swisher is doing very well, Joe Blanton is a #3 A's starter now, but no other draftee of theirs that year is spectacular -- most aren't even in the majors yet. One prospect they ridiculed and passed on, Prince Fielder, is looking like a new star for the Brewers. So while the A's got a huge number of the guys they wanted, those guys haven't by and large panned out to be all that great, no more than any other team's, that I can see. Their picks seem to about on par with other teams' picks.   <br /> <br />So while the book's premise is intriguing, from what I can see, it hasn't proven itself to be true yet by a long shot. That may change over time, and we can see a handful of teams now mimicking the A's philosophy (Red Sox, Blue Jays, Padres for starters). Time will tell.  <br /> <br />Knowing this, that the jury is still very much out, I have to say that to me it seems like the attack on Joe Morgan in the last part of the book is way over the top and out of line. Morgan has a right to his opinion, and he's paid money to give his opinion on TV. A career like his gives him the right to speak his mind, and actually he has more credibility than Beane or Lewis based on that alone. It would definitely be better for Morgan if he'd examine the evidence a bit closer, rather than refuse to read the book. Lewis meanwhile attacks Morgan for wrongly claiming Beane wrote the book (among other things). As far as I can tell, Morgan never said that. Morgan    did say that Beane says in the book that he is \\"smarter than everyone else.\\" (which isn't literally true, but it's the gist of Beane's attitude, honestly) Beane isquoted often in the book, saying lots of things, from cover to cover. That doesn't mean he wrote the book, and if Morgan says that Beane said something in the book, that's not the same as Morgan saying Beane wrote the book. My gut says Lewis is dishonestly twisting what Morgan said, of disingenuosuly throwing fuel on the fire. It is possible I missed some quote of Morgan where he clearly says that Beane wrote the book -- and I did look for it. I've looked at the quotes that Morgan's critics (incl. Lewis' in the book) cite as 'proof' -- and none of those quotes state what they say it states. But if anyone can find where Morgan actually says that Beane wrote Moneyball, I would like to see it.  <br /> <br />I'm kind of neutral where Joe Morgan is concerned. I think he'd probably learn something by reading the book, and I think Lewis also goes too far in his claims and attacks. Moneyball has some interesting, intriguing ideas in it that may or may not be valid over the long run. But the experiments are underway, and in time we'll know. My gut says some will turn out to be true and some not.

B0000074CU|5.0|You all know the score by now - fewer and fewer people are challenging the opinion that Rory Gallagher was perhaps the finest, most fiery and most consistent guitarist of the last 50 years and, thank God, he left lots and lots of proof.  <br /> <br />Just before going on stage for the Isle of Wight set, Taste had their gear stolen and so had to play on borrowed kit - and just look what they achieved. Rory manages to produce bursts of speed and fire on the old Strat without ever entering the dreaded realms of widdly woo inhabited by such as Van Halen, Satriani and the whole ghastly lot of them, however good they may be technically. <br /> <br />What's Going on?, the opener for On the Boards (buy NOW), just steams and roars with the whole band's interlocked ability. Sinner Boy has the most staggering slide solo and Feel So Good has the most wonderful intro and outro - and Rory is at double speed on this. Catfish, by then their show stopper, is a true show stopper: but the whole set is really really good and full of class. McCraken on bass and John Wilson on kit are very good and often underestimated. They push Rory on and challenge him to new heights.  <br /> <br />I know a lot of folk who went to this festival and they all talked with awe in their voices about Taste and Procol Harum, with Robbie Trower at that stage. They all agreed, too, that Hendrix was, sadly as often, out of tune, out of time, horribly stoned and uninspiring. Legend and fond memory has changed this view, but I saw Rory make Hendrix look very small at the Woburn Abbey festival in 68,with a pretty grim bass and drummer, so I believe it. Hendrix' live recordings are mostly quite unlistenable, Rory's are almost all fantastic. I think that posterity may have made the biggest error of all time in putting Hendrix on a pedestal and forgetting Rory G. He wouldn't have thought so, of course - far too modest and self effacing.  <br /> <br />This is a very good and very exciting performance. Just remind yourself, or learn for the first time, who was the real blues guitarist and singer of the 60s and 70s. Yes indeed - and great vocals too. Remember also that these were young kids, all younger than the memnbers of, say, Fall Out Boy. There's a lesson there somewhere about \\"progress\\" ..... <br /> <br />Indispensible - to redress the balance a little about who \\"got\\" the blues from the outset. <br />

B00078XGRO|5.0|I really love this movie but beware, I don't know what I was thinking I thought this was the directors cut which usually puts back all the deleted seens in a movie.  Well this one isn't it.  It will show you the seens deleted as extras but not intergrated back into the movie.  Thats my only complaint but that is a minor complaint and totally my fault.  The movie itself is a great, try watching it on a big sreen TV you will love it esp. the opening fight seen in the movie when the Borg attack the fleet.  This is a great buy so don't hesitate if you haven't seen the movie or just want it for you collection.
0060512806|4.0|The best way to describe the Cryptonomicon is that it is an adventure story about mathematicians.   <br /> <br />While Mr. Stephenson has made his reputation writing books that are in the so-called cyber punk genre, this is a mainstream novel that features mathematicians, intellectualism, and a strong dose of what Stephenson calls in another book, \\"...the imp of the mischievous.\\"  So while the target audience of the book may well be hormonal teen-age boys who like computers and math, it is well written enough that most readers will enjoy the time invested in reading this rather large book. <br /> <br />Having read most, if not all, of Mr. Stephenson's other books; this book is clearly the best one.  This is true in terms of readability, plot, and character development.  While there are some real shortcomings in terms of female character development and in the conclusion of the book, this is the only book by Stephenson that is really well written enough to be a mainstream novel. <br /> <br />The book weaves two distinct stories together.  The first is the story of Waterhouse, Goto Dengo, Enoch Root, and Shaftoe in World War II.  The second is the story of how these individuals and/or their grand-children and/or children in the modern day world interact in a related story-line that involves stolen Japanese gold, a mysterious German submarine, and a very bizarre assortment of supporting characters. <br /> <br />This book was written back around 1999. It is amazing how much technology Stephenson actually got right. Even more impressive is the fact that the novel is readable by a typical layman without much math or computer science background.  Likewise, there are plenty of clues in this book that tie back to Stephenson's Baroque Cycle of novels. While the Baroque Cycle was published after the Cryptonomicon, it was designed to be a prequel. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to anyone who fits one or more of the following criteria: <br /> <br />(1) You are occasionally seized by the \\"Imp of the Mischievous\\" and do incredibly stupid things. <br />(2) You think math is cool. <br />(3) You think cryptology is fun and interesting. <br />(4) You like computers and telecommunications. <br />(5) You like reading about the weird \\"super weapons\\" the Germans wasted money on <br />(6) You have lived in the Philippines <br /> <br />One word of warning, I have lent my copy of the Cryptonomicon to others and they found Stephenson's use of sexuality and sarcasm a bit over the top.  However, that may just be a matter of taste. I did not find either venue particularly offensive. Overall, a good book that glamorizes math and those who love it. <br /> <br />  <br />
075640407X|5.0|As a child, Kvothe traveled with his parents from town to town as part of a troupe giving performances.  His parents were quite talented, had the patronage of a lord, and stopped at only the best places.  The troupe added Abertino who taught Kvothe much about his magic and was quite surprised how easily the lad picked up his lessons.  After his mentor leaves the troupe, Kvothe decides to attend the University where he can obtain formal lessons in the use of magic.  However his life is shattered after returning from a long solo walk to ponder his future; he finds everyone including his parents dead, killed by the Chandrian because his dad was collecting knowledge on them so that he could write a song about them.<br /><br />A traumatized Kvothe heads for the big city where he becomes a homeless vagabond who is picked on by everyone who lives on the streets.  Still he does what he must to stay alive until he finally reaches the University.  Three days later he is moved into the Arcanum, the school of magic where he makes an enemy of an older student Ambrose, who makes Kvothe's life miserable, which escalates until he jeopardizes the newcomer's life. Kvothe has had enough and gets Ambrose in trouble with the school authorities.  Some call him a hero; others a killer as his legend has just begun.<br /><br />This is a complex enthralling \\"biographical\\" fantasy that will stun sub-genre fans with its vividness and depth as if Patrick Rothfuss has written numerous thrillers instead of his first.  Kvothe's youthful tale is told mostly by him as he ventures forth once his beloved parents and the rest of those in his \\"world\\" were murdered.  Readers will appreciate this strong saga of a young hero's salad days while looking forward to further escapades of Kvothe in \\"day two\\" of his story to the Chronicler.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

0061015725|4.0|This is another tautly written fast paced thriller from Michael Crichton.  Jack Foreman had been a respected computer programmer until he had been unjustly fired six months earlier.  Jack's wife Julia was now the sole breadwinner and Jack was taking care of the children and looking for another job.  When Jack was offered a position with wife's firm he took the position despite some reservations.  Within hours of taking the job Jack was regretting that he ignored those reservations.   <br /> <br />The threat in this thriller comes not from dinosaurs (Jurassic Park) or outer space (Andromeda Strain) but from nanotechnology, incredibly small machines with the capability of causing extremely large problems.  As with Jurassic Park, Prey deals with the issue of scientific discoveries exceeding our ability to control them.   <br /> <br />As with all of Crichton's work this novel draws the reader into the action quickly, making the reader reluctant to put it down without finding out what will happen next.  The characters are rather one dimensional, the situations are improbable, the ending far fetched but it is fun.

0143039431|5.0|Steinbeck was a red, and this book is infused with politics; but, unlike Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, The Grapes of Wrath is a fine work of literature. Not perfect, not without flaws, not as good as Zola's similarly-themed Germinal, but still a classic achievement by a truly great American author. Everyone should read it, from socialists to Shriners, and, as with any work of fiction, take it cum grano salis.<br /><br />Steinbeck didn't like capitalism, because, especially during the Depression, there were many things about it not to like. His prediction that the private ownership of the means of production was soon to be over (as of 1939) hasn't been borne out...but the guy is not remembered for being a commie pantywaist, or a spectacularly-wrong prognosticator.<br /><br />He was a writer, an exceptional one, and most people claim this is his best book. (I would argue that Of Mice and Men holds that distinction, but Grapes is almost five times as long...and how can a six-hundred-page book be worse'n a novella?)<br /><br />Whatever you think, about politics, economics, or literature, this book is not a waste of time.

If that's all you want from a movie (Giant tornadoes, snow-covered landslides and mountains of water filling the streets of coastal America) you'll be pleased with this movie.<br /><br />If, however, you want a plot, storyline and viable conclusion, you will be (as I was) greatly disappointed.<br /><br />For a movie of this type to work, you have to care about the characters.

The low-key blues charms of \\"Hannibal\\" and \\"Blues for Salvador\\" both find Carlos taking off with plenty of barnstorming licks. The blues hooks and subtle synth accompaniment starts tugging at your mind after only a couple of spins.  Plus the opener, \\"Bailando/Aquatic Park\\" is a fantastic; upbeat and tasteful.

B0009X7664|5.0|A masterful portayal by Gregory Peck of a white lawyer who has the integrity to defend a black man falsely accused of rape in the 1930s South.

B000005RFQ|5.0|This doesn't even come CLOSE to being a normal Black Sabbath album.  All the vocals are loud, EXTREMELY loud.  The lead singer, who became famous from Deep Purple, screams a lot, and let me tell you, Black Sabbath isn't supposed to be a band that has a screamer for a lead singer.  However, somehow, it works here. <br /> <br />\\"disturbing the priest\\" is about the LOUDEST Black Sabbath song I think I've ever heard.  I love the crashing lightning bolt-like guitar riffs in between the screams.  I also think \\"keep it warm\\" is a nice way to close out the album, even though it's basically a slow ballad with guitar riffs slowly playing in the background. <br /> <br />\\"zero the hero\\" is a pretty cool song, and \\"trashed\\" is a fast-paced rocker that's a nice way to open a heavy metal album, though not really what I'd consider a good way to open a Black Sabbath album.  The album is really good though.  Take a break from the Ozzy Sabbath and listen to this.

You will find that the overall beauty of the music is really something special.
0671045792|5.0|Ambrose's stories of male friendship would be good in any format, but why read what Ambrose wrote when you can hear him read it to you? There is the added benefit of hearing Ambrose's emphasis on a phrase, his light-hearted tone in some areas and, even more important to the emotional punch of some of the stories, hearing his voice break at particularly touching moments (perhaps the most touching was a comment that is highlighted in HBO's 'Band of Brothers'. A veteran of Easy Company is asked by his grandson, \\"Grandpa, were you a hero in the war?\\" \\"No. I served in a company of heroes.\\")<br /><br />Ambrose focuused on the friendship he and his brothers share, his friends from college, from work, the friendships of Lewis and Clark, Dwight Eisenhower and his brother Milton, Lewis and Clark, the men of Easy Comapny in 'Band of Brothers', the friendship of men who fought against one another in war but meet again as old men and the friendship between Ambrose and his father. I was surprised that he did not mention the friendship that he shares with his sons since he did the friendship between he shared with his father.<br /><br />Ambrose comments on the beauty of friendship between old men - no rivalry, nothing but support and love. He notes that he can't wait until he is old and can enjoy such friendships. Sadly, Ambrose died of cancer in 2002 at the age of 66.<br /><br />I give this one a grade of A-
B00005V1B1|5.0|I'm going to say something that many people might disagree with, but needs to be said. Even though Camel's Mirage album is a progressive rock album, you do NOT have to be a fan of prog-rock to fall in love with this album. I believe anyone who's a fan of jamming rock bands such as Eric Clapton or Crazy Horse would really enjoy the music on Mirage. <br /> <br />Camel are the masters of knowing how to write memorable songs. The jams are melodic, not to mention creative. They include keyboards, guitars, flutes, drums, bass, organs, and who knows what else. All this adds up to one fantastic listen. Over and over again I listen to this album and can't believe how good it not only sounds, but IS. The music is great. Every song is written so carefully to the point of being extremely melodic. It's incredible. <br /> <br />I wish Camel would tour the USA more. Some of us over here LOVE this band. Heck, even my dad who doesn't listen to rock music anymore said he LOVES what this band is doing. \\"freefall\\" is SO melodic, \\"lady fantasy\\" will remind you of dreams you had as a child. Those dreams will return and be as pleasant as ever when listening to this song. The rest of the album maintains that pleasant dream atmosphere and helps me conclude this album is truly worth owning. If something ever happened to my copy, I'd buy another one immediately.

However, the more you hear them, the more the vocals and guitar playing seem to stand out, and you eventually conclude how good the music is.  <br /> <br />It's 60's music, and that means the album has that very dated but distinct sound, though it's NOT a bad thing at all. I enjoy the album, though I think Crosby Stills and Nash had a better version of \\"wooden ships\\". Sorry, but they do. Some of the singing is quite good, though to be honest, the guitar playing is mostly what you should remember about this album. However, \\"good shepherd\\" is one of the most likable songs of all-time. I will stand by that forever. GREAT song. <br /> <br />It's too bad I've never been able to hear the first song in its entirety. My record has a big scratch right in the middle of the song, and I don't want to risk the life of my needle to find out that it obviously won't play.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|After watching this cute and heartwarming movie, all I can say is WOOF. What a hot cast, dressed or undressed and if that were not enough, they <br />can act and do so, very well. The sexual torment that the young man is going through is very believable and his deliverance from it brought tears to my eyes. In spite of the graphic scenes, nudity and erect penises, I would not call this remotely pornographic, but rather more <br />of an art film. Also great work on the director's part.
B00000DCH9|4.0|I can't believe Billy Joel's Piano Man hasn't become a classic album that everyone needs to own.  We're talking about a solid collection of songs.  Some of the songs here sound like something Barry Manilow would do, except of course, in the typical Billy Joel songwriting style.   <br /> <br />\\"worse comes to worse\\" HAS to be one of his most underrated songs.  I love that one.  \\"captain jack\\" is another song I can listen to over and over and get caught up in the smokey atmosphere and quiet vocals, until the loud chorus comes crashing in.  It's awesome. <br /> <br />I also love \\"travelin' prayer\\".  It reminds me of \\"the entertainer\\".  Maybe it influenced that song, I don't know.   <br /> <br />The only reason I didn't give Piano Man 5 stars is because the title song is a bit overplayed, and I'm tired of it.  It doesn't really interest me anymore.  I understand it was the song to turn Billy Joel into a worldwide phenomenon, but I don't care for it much anymore.  The rest of the album rules.
B000N6TX22|4.0|`Children of Men', directed by Alfonso Charon, and starring Clive Owen is being touted as a `Blade Runner' for the 21st Century. This blurb was the primary reason for my interest in viewing the DVD, since `Blade Runner' is easily on of the five (5) best all time Science Fiction movies.<br /><br />`Children of Men' is no `Blade Runner', and does not even have many similarities with `Blade Runner', aside from those things which every work labeled `Science Fiction' has in common with every other SciFi work and the fact that both are set in the 2020s. While `Blade Runner' is a relatively slow-paced `film noir' piece with a lot of exposition laying out the single underlying premise, `Children of Men' is a marathon of frenetic action and tension, with relatively little exposition to explain the reasons for the multiple `what if' premises which turn this into a SciFi flick. That does not mean this is a poor movie, only that comparing it to `Blade Runner' does not reveal anything insightful about the story.<br /><br />Part of the problem I had with the thinness of the exposition on the background is that there are two different premises driving the plot, and I could see no connection between the two, although there was plenty of interactions between the two premises. The first premise, clearly stated in the trailers, is the fact that the entire human population has gone infertile for the last 18 years (beginning in 2009). The second premise, working largely as the palate from which is painted the story's background is painted, is the assumption that the kind of insurgency common in Iraq today has spread to virtually all civilized countries.<br /><br />It may be that the most compelling thing about this movie is the way in which this background has been directed and filmed. The blocking and cinematography actually have a lot in common with Stephen Speilberg's first 15 minutes of `Saving Private Ryan'. The skill with which the camerawork emulates a documentary style makes one believe they are watching CNN, assuming CNN would actually air these scenes. Another movie with which `Children of Men' shares much is the recent English horror flick `28 Days Later', although `Children...' is far more original, with higher production values.<br /><br />The DVD's commentaries are a bit thin, and I'm surprised that they don't bring out the Christian allegory of the story line. While it may not be the primary theme, it should be obvious to anyone who views the movie at least twice.<br /><br />This is Clive Owen's film from start to finish. Costars Julianne Moore and Michael Caine appear in just a few short scenes each, and their top billing is primarily to highlight the importance of their scenes, which may be inadequately done by the narrative.<br /><br />This film easily has some of the socially and politically most interesting SciFi premises since `Soylent Green' and `Logan's Run', and is cinematically far more interesting than these relatively routine Hollywood products; but it won't make my list of top 10 best SciFi movies.es one believe they are watching CNN, assuming CNN would actually air these scenes.

074356619X|1.0|\\"The Secret\\" is not a secret at all, it is merely an unsophisticated rehash of 19th century New Thought philosophy. Some of the techniques make for good psychology of the \\"Positive Thinking\\" variety, but the metaphysical claims are so overblown as to be silly. <br /> <br />According to \\"The Secret\\" all the people dying in Iraq (or anywhere else) are drawing that fate to themselves by their own thoughts, since only their own thoughts can have any effect on their lives.  <br /> <br />There are sophisticated and worthwhile expositions of the \\"New Thought\\" philosophy, but this isn't one of them.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|This show is a rarity in today's world of Tv programming. Smart, funny and full of wit. There is a mystery in every episode, all boiling down to a bigger whole season mystery. If you are looking for something different,  really don't care who wants to be a millionaire, definitely give this a try!
B000MTPANQ|5.0|Fantastic performance, Neil Young is the best. it does not give to lose
B000O178BY|5.0|Don't be fooled, \\"Year Zero\\" sounds nothing like previous Nine Inch Nails releases. Perhaps its because the whole album was constructed on a lap top music making program. Perhaps because Trent Reznor has evolved as a human being. Perhaps its because \\"Year Zero\\" is part of a bigger picture, a concept album that depicts a story set in a dystopian future where the government oversteps its boundries in a post apocalyptical cyberpunk world. Perhaps because the planets and stars were aligned at the perfect moment. <br />Whatver the case may be, \\"Year Zero\\" sounds worlds apart from all of the previous Nine Inch Nails outings, and for the better. Yes, it sounds much different from \\"With Teeth\\", a less than stellar, yet enjoyable album. \\"Year Zero\\" sounds nothing like \\"The Downward Spiral\\", even though a select few are comparing them. And it certainly sounds nothing like \\"The Fragile\\", NIN's most versatile and complete recording. <br /> <br /> One thing that you must remember is that all previous Nine Inch Nails albums convey a vary dark world and very self-depricating lyrics, bi-polar depression rantings, sickness and healing.  <br />Unlike all of his previous albums, \\"Year Zero\\" features lyrics that have nothing to do with Trent Reznor's problems. It is a concept album, and an awesome one at that.  <br />Maybe its because I am in love with anything cyberpunk, to which this album directly relates, in both sound and lyrics, that I find awesome. Or maybe its because Trent is evolving as an artist and as a human, shedding the depressing and darkness allowing for a more cohesive vision to protrude through. I don't know. <br />That is not to say that \\"The Downward Spiral\\" and \\"The Fragile\\" are not amazing projects, because they are. Personally I feel that \\"The Fragile\\" is the best album Nine Inch Nails has released, with \\"The Downward Spiral\\" coming in second. But there is something about \\"Year Zero\\" and its concept that is most intriguing. <br />Evolution. <br />Yes, the most amazing thing about this album is that Trent is not regurgitating the same ol' thing again. \\"With Teeth\\" was the same ol' stuff we have heard him sing a thousand times. That is why its not really all that amazing, we have heard it before. <br />No, \\"Year Zero\\" features lyrics depicting a particular event or narration from a particular persons viewpoint within this grand story that Trent has created. And that makes \\"Year Zero\\" the best. <br /> <br />People are going to draw major conclusions, stating that \\"Year Zero\\" is a direct relation to the present state of our world, with President Bush and the Patriot Act, the war....on and on. <br />While I agree, the present state of anything is going to affect anyone creating art, it only served as a catalyst. Distopian cyberpunk stories have been around since the early 80's, maybe even before that. <br />I have always had a vision that Trent Reznor could conjure up a great story, and here it is. Well part of it. Rumor is, that this is part one, and there is possibly a movie too. I can only hope! <br /> <br />Another thing that makes this album so monumentous, and it IS monumentous, is the lengths Trent went to hype this album up. The flash drives with leaked material and pure noise containing messages, secret messages on tour t-shirts, the web sites with all the little tidbits and back stories. Its a very clever marketing scheme, and a fun way to involve all of the fans in a little game of discovery, which it did. The internet was all buzzing over the sites and flash drives and hidden messages. <br /> <br />OK, enough of all that, onto the album... <br />\\"Year Zero\\" features music entirely displaced in the Nine Inch Nails catalogue. But at the same time it fits perfectly. The reason I say that it is displaced is that there are barely any guitars or screaming involved. Much more emphasis is placed on regular singing, and the music is comprised of Trip-Hop/electronic/noise. Break beats are melded with semi-industrial beats toform an awesome and original sound.  <br />Yes, I said Break Beats! There is a small tinge of influence from Hip-Hop/Trip Hop going on in the beats, along with Trent's passion for Industrial drums.  <br /> Ambient and other electronic sounds pervade each track. The best way I can describe it is that this is PURE lap top music in all its glory and greatness. What I would consider \\"futuristic\\" music. <br />There are no definable \\"sadness\\" parts or \\"depressing\\" melodies to be found on \\"Year Zero\\", a nice change. I cannot express how happy I am that Trent has decided to try something different. On the same note, Trent's signature instrument, the piano, doesn't come in until \\"Another Version of the Truth\\" (beautiful piano by the way, just beautiful), the third to the last track on the album!  <br /> It is awesome to hear a Nine Inch Nails album that doesn't overkill with guitars and screaming. <br />Evolution, baby. <br />Oh, \\"The Great Destroyer\\" probably features the most guitar work on the album. But compared to albums like \\"The Downward Spiral\\" and \\"The Fragile\\", the guitar work is tamer than a Sonny and Cher song. <br />By the way, \\"The Great Destroyer\\" features one of the finest \\"noise\\" freak outs I have ever heard. <br />Like I said earlier, the whole album was comprised on a lap top computer program, and you can certainly tell. Well, at least I can, being that I make music on lap top program as well, and I can spot out the sound. Igf you are familiar with computer music programs, then you will be able to discern the different sounds in each song and the type of effect and manipulation Trent used to achieve that particular effect. <br />Trent even stated himself that most of the songs were created out of doodling on said computer program, and all of the songs were crafted in little time. <br />If anyting, the great amount of noise featured on \\"Year Zero\\" takes place of the massive distorted guitars of previous albums, and it sounds perfect. The whole musical atmosphere of \\"Year Zero\\" perfectly depicts a dystopian, cyberpunk world. There are some guitars featured, but they are sparse, and they never overwhelm the album. Overall, behind the break beats, there is a deep ambient mood pervading this album, and lots of layers to peel away. Random blips and bloops, dissonance and noise creep around each corner, but they always fit within what is going on. <br />On to Trent's lyrics... <br />Very political. Very very political. But that is the essence of the story, not necessarily reflecting present day world issues, but at the same time, is. <br />One thing that is of note, the song \\"Meet Your Master\\" sounds like it wouldn't be out of place on an earlier Nine Inch Nails album, however it still fits within the mythos of the concept. <br />I haven't quite put together the whole story featured on the album yet, it seems that the album most likely takes place in America, where the government is getting out of control. Control is the word, trying to control thoughts, actions, everything. The government has put a chemical in the water that controls everyone. Basically, everything is falling apart. Themes of war play a big part as well. <br />There are seeds of dissent as well, groups that are trying to fight the government.  <br />There is a mysterious being called the Presence, featured on the cover of the album, however I don't know much about this being. <br />I haven't been able to delve too deep into the lyrics yet to grasp the story, but from what I have heard, I am very pleased. <br />Just the fact that this album isn't another depressing outing is good enough for me.  <br />As far as structure wise, everything falls within a linear fashion, save the crazy noise orgasms that frequent this album. Verse, chorus, verse, aside from short instrumental passages, of which \\"Another Version of the Truth\\" is one of these.   Each song has little moments that make each track stand out. There is no song that is forgettable, or skippable, not yet at least.  <br />The last song on the album, \\"Zero-Sum\\" I(which I think is the only other song to feature piano, besides \\"Another Version of the Truth\\") is kind of funny, because it has the whole \\"moral\\" thing to it, the NIN way of course. Just listen to the chorus. Its tongue-in cheek <br /> <br />I was very disappointed in \\"With Teeth\\", and I thought that the end was around the corner for Nine Inch Nails. I figured \\"washed-up\\", \\"has been\\" applied. And then Trent does something that totally redeems himself!  <br />That is not to say that critics won't bash this album. Oh, yes this album will be the target of haters galore. Why? Because the general concept of the story has been done before. Because people with write this off as Trent Reznor's attempt at a politically charged album. I also know that many will attack this album on the basis that it was totally created on a computer. Many people consider music made on a computer NOT music. There is actually a lot of hatred toward non-traditional music( by tradtional I mean music made with guitars, bass, drums..etc..).  <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor, don't pass this album up. Give it a few good listens, it is well worth it. The beats alone are \\"tight\\", in a way that Nine Inch Nails beats have never been before. The production is very \\"tight\\" as well. <br />Trent totally satisfied exactly what I wanted to hear from him, a wonderful concept album with heavy futuristic overtones. <br />All in all, \\"Year Zero\\" is a great album, that may not break the boundries of amazing musicianship, but does exactly what it is supposed to. It conveys a story. And a darn good one too. <br /> <br />
B00004U28G|5.0|GREAT movie!  Tons of celebs.  All race across country for the grand prize. Many laughs along the way.
B000065VB0|5.0|To me this is the album where Gabriel really got it together as a solo artist.  In my opinion it is his best solo work with rock solid material throughout the whole thing.  From a songwriting perspective the album contains some of Gabriel's best lyrics and the music, although not as dynamic as his Genesis days, comes across as a perfect fit with the dramatic vocals and lyrics.  Musically the thing that really stands out on this disc is the percussion.  Gabriel made the decision that his drummers would not use any cymbals on this disc which lends the percussion a unique quality.  The drumming duties were shared by Jerry Marotta and Phil Collins consistently coming across as loud and booming, a style that Gabriel would incorporate throughout the rest of his career.  The overall percussion work on this disc is really outstanding.  The album also sees Gabriel making his first forays into \\"world\\" music, which he would explore in much more detail later in his career.  Once again, the tribal percussion aspect of these tracks is a highlight.  The songs on the album are consistently great.  Highlights include the album opener \\"Intruder\\" a truly creepy song about a burglar who obviously loves his job.  Next is \\"No Self-Control\\", another great song that pretty much describes periods of my own life.  \\"I Don't Remember\\" was an AOR hit and a great little rocker with that booming drum sound.  \\"Family Snapshot\\" seems to be a portrait of a presidential assassin (Lee Harvey Oswald maybe?) until the song gets to the final few lines where we find out that it is really just a young child playing a fantasy in his own mind, in desperate need of attention.  Is this a foreshadowing of what the child will be as an adult?  The song is a prime example of Gabriel at his absolute best.  \\"And Through The Wire\\" could possibly be a sequel to \\"On The Air\\" from the previous album.  \\"Games Without Frontiers\\" was another AOR radio hit that reduces the act of war to a children's game.   It is another brilliant track.  \\"Not One Of Us\\" can be related to by anyone who has been considered an outsider and is another great track.  The album closes with \\"Biko\\" which presents an historical account of the death of South African freedom fighter Stephen Biko who was killed while imprisoned.  It is a powerful piece of music that resonates to this day.  Gabriel 3 is the man at his absolute best.  If you are looking to explore Gabriel's solo albums this would be a great place to start.  Personally I do not think he has done anything better.
B000ILYYJE|4.0|I have collected The Doors up for some 30 years & again they release a box set of their classic studio albums. The packaging is superb & they added DVD's to the mix which could have been better but overall, a nice collection with bonus tracks included. If you really want a nice but simpler package, try the last box set with basically re-mixed material as these recordings. so what is next? the complete \\"Live\\" recordings box set? Ya never know ;-)  Search \\"Judemac Forever\\" on msn.
B000I2J6K0|5.0|This is the first time I have ever reviewed a product, but I felt I had to say something about this DVD. I have always been a fitness enthusiast, but for the last year or so had let it slide, and then I had a high-risk first trimester and did nothing. But I've been doing the workout nearly daily for the last couple of months (I'm at 7 mos). At the beginning I did everything very gingerly until I was confident that all the moves were safe etc., and I have never had a problem. As soon as the warmup starts, it puts me in the mood to workout and the 40 minutes speed by. My belly is *huge* but I feel strong and toned everywhere else, which is nice. After the workout I often do 20-30 minutes of yoga (Sara Holliday). <br /> <br />Anyway, the DVD has made a difference in my pregnancy, both physically and psychologically, and I wanted to recommend it.
0552998087|1.0|Bill Brysons book 'The Lost Continent' sucks. I picked up this book from the library expecting it to be like his other novel, Bill Bryson Down Under. Instead, all I got was (as another reviewer commented) a hate trip down memory lane full of his gratuitous dislike for his home country. The book reads like an adolescent wrote it in high school. He talks about the epidemic of bloated women, calls each town boring, picks on each stereotype he can possibly comment on and doesn't offer much in the way of entertainment. You also get the sense he's a patriot for his adopted country, England, and doesn't have a mote of pride for where he was born. Apparently the grass is greener on the other side for this fellow. I enjoyed Bill Bryson's 'Down Under' as a resident Aussie, but this book has turned me off all Bryson. Trash
0743289412|3.0|6.3 stars out of 10. <br /> <br />Actually I'm just writing this review for the title.  I thought this title would be all too obvious to us readers who are obviously not fully enamored with the latest King effort.   <br /> <br />I don't have much to add about the difficulty in getting over the enormous mountain of the first half of this book to finally enter the second half.  In the second half SK finally does relent somewhat in banging us over the head with his obnoxious leitmotif words, cutesy tropes, Hank Williams fetish, and too long but necessary exposition to establish the relationship between Lisey and hubby.  They still crop up but in the second half he finally gets to the moneyshot parts of the story.  Actually saying \\"leitmotif\\" or \\"trope\\" is giving his literary technique a little too much honor.  The way he pounds those words home is like he's with his rock band \\"The Rock Bottom Remainders\\" and he's found a groovy couple of licks that he can't get out of his system.  I really don't feel like strapping it on as much as he'd like us to.  So, sorry, no SOWISA for me today! <br /> <br />That's nothing new for SK, of course, he's always reveled in the use of American junk culture as his \\"paintbrush\\" technique and using that recurring imagery as signposts and landmarks, but here in Lisey's Story he has the pretension of crossing over to \\"literature.\\"   <br /> <br />I like the idea of the myth pool, the word pool, the \\"what have you\\" pool.  We are all swimming in an unseen cultural cache of ideas that shape us without our fully knowing it. And I think we all have some kind of massive, inchoate, barely-understood Long Boy bete noire that moves through it, waking us at an unseemly hour without us ever quite knowing who, how, what or why we're being disturbed.   <br /> <br />Every culture partakes and uses just a small portion of the vast sea of knowledge.  It takes years to really learn about the currents that we are in.  The streams have their eddies, their quietspots, their white water rapids, etc. and in order to, so to speak, lift our head out of it and have full consciousness of that which we're imbibing takes a lifetime of learning.  But SK, I feel, just doesn't have the native talent to enter those waters as deeply as he'd like to.  Booya Moon is pretty good but its not quite the deep European woods of the Brothers Grimm.  It's not Valhalla.  It's not the Olympian home of the gods.  SK's talent is as the great American schlockmeister who always longingly wants to be something greater.  His \\"parthenon\\" is the Golden Arches of McDonalds and the Hollywood sign in California and the dark side thereof.  He obviously longs to want to create a new American mythology with as deep a resonance as world mythology and he's been trying for the past 30 years or so but, like Moses, he'll never make it to the promised land.  <br /> <br />Okay, enough graduate school nonsense.  I think there's a great story here hidden within a good but flawed novel. I think if the right screenwriter coupled with the right director were connected to a project this could make a dynamite film full of elegaic sadness, a paean to the depths of a long marriage, CGI beauty and a hopeful ending.
1904233023|5.0|This is Orson Scott Card's finest work and is one of the top science fiction novels I've ever written.  The story centers around a young boy named Ender who goes away to \\"Battle School,\\" a futuristic space boarding school. It may sound like a children's novel, but it is certainly not.  I first read this in high school when a friend recommended it to me and have reread it several times over the past decade or so because I enjoyed it so much.  Card has spun this story into several other directions, so you can keep reading if you enjoyed it (try Ender's Shadow or Shadow of the Hegemon), but none of the others come close to being as good, although they are not bad books.  I'd recommend this for anyone, teenage through adult, who likes science fiction at all, and even for those who don't think they like science ficiton, because Card avoids the pitfalls that many science fiction authors fall into, like not having strong characters and letting the \\"science\\" overpower the story.
B00008WT49|5.0|<br />  I was really looking forward <br /> to this cd, but unfortunatally <br /> I didnt receive it.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|I had gone to see these guys with My Chemical Romance recently. This CD was on my list of music to buy, however I just hadn't gotten around to it. After seeing them live, I had to have the CD right away. When I experienced \\"Prayer of the Refugee\\", the song had me at the first transition. \\"Drones\\" is placed perfectly right after \\"Prayer of the Refugee\\"; it's an excellent follow-up. There is not one song on the entire CD that you'd want to miss.
1559408855|1.0|I'm a firm believer in freedom of speech, but honestly this movie was disgusting without any redeeming qualities. The product description listed above is completely misleading. It's basically a movie in which the abusers abuse and degrade their victims, and then at the end they slowly torture them to death. Pretty much the worst movie I have ever seen.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|There is NO global warming ! Mother Nature has her good years and bad....simple as that. Fifteen years ago these same people said we were headed for a second ice age !!! Don't believe me ??? It was on the cover of Time Magazine..... \\"Are We Headed For Another Ice Age ?\\". No matter how they package it, you just can't make this fly. People who \\"LOVE\\" this film, were already believers. This film is just bolstering there belief in this VERY misguided theory ! Sad really.
0743455967|5.0|I don't even like Stephen King's books--I love the stories but not the writing.  But, a writer friend gave me this book and WHOA!  It's great!  Very encouraging, honest, and readable. It's one of the two best books I've ever read from a successful author to a would-be writier.  The other is \\"Bird by Bird\\" by Anne Lamott.  Ok, so shoot me, I don't care for her writing style either!
B000068FWC|5.0|<br />  Thank you <br /> I received the cd quik and <br /> the cd is in excellent condition <br /> <br />  thank you again <br /> <br />   Dirk
B000GG4KTU|5.0|One way to judge \\"From This Moment On\\" as a great CD is that I keep rating the songs at 5 stars on my IPOD. I find myself looking forward to spending part of my summer vacation listening to her as I relax in a lounge chair. To repeat a contemparary cliche, Diane Krall tells a story with every song. Her voice has a sultry quality with a perfect balance between sweet and tart. For the old songs on this CD, she is a natural. Like a fine, perfectly balanced wine, Diane Krall will age well for a lifetime or more.
B000O178BY|5.0|I was deathly afraid of Year Zero as I wasn't completely blown away by With Teeth. I consider both The Fragile And The Downward Spiral to be masterful works of art, but With Teeth felt like Trent had settled a bit, perhaps feeling a bit burned by the inexplicable dismissal of The Fragile by the \\"music buying public.\\" The result was a spotty, inconsistent album. It lacked focus. While I loved the \\"Beside You In Time\\" tour, I feared Trent might be nearing his creative end, especially when I heard he'd cranked out Year Zero in record time. <br /> <br />Whoa, baby. Was I wrong. I am sorry for ever doubting you, Trent! This is your most refreshing music since 1999. I've listened to it about four times now, and I can already say it's something unique, special and consistent with your best work. Unlike With Teeth, Year Zero flows the way his other albums have. I haven't even digested the dystopian theme yet, but I'm looking forward to buying the actual release, following the zany \\"spiral\\" viral campaign you've concocted for this puppy, seeing the tour and finally hearing the conclusion in the eventual part II. You are a genius and a mastermind, Mr. Reznor. Welcome back!
0060775858|5.0|I love to read and re read this book to my 9 month old.  The book is very colorful so it keeps his attention.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|While I understand why Brosnan was not the right choice for this, a prequel, I have to think there could have been a better choice than Daniel Craig. Not that he did a bad job, but a Jason Stratham from \\"The Transporter\\" and \\"The Transporter 2\\" may have been a better choice. All in all, this was a great Bond movie. While the producers played with fire altering the opening sequences's legendary gun barrel opening, they had the sense to keep Mony Norman's timeless theme intact. As this movie has, at this writing, grossed close to $600 million dollars and the producers have already signed Craig for the next film, we can only hope they see something in Craig the rest of us don't.
B00005JPC7|4.0|...was one of the best movie-going experiences I ever had. My husband and I went to see it one Saturday back in last December on the 14:15 (2:15 PM) show and we had the small, comfortable, stadium-like theater all to ourselves. I was delighted but my husband gave me a suspicious look before the movie began and asked if I was sure that was the movie I wanted to see. I was sure - I've seen the trailer several times and I loved the idea the movie was based on: an IRS employee, Harold Crick (Will Ferrell has proved admirably to be able to play serious roles) leads the ordered, quite boring full of numbers and digits life only one morning to realize that he is somehow happened to be a main character in a new novel from famous, neurotic, reclusive, chain smoking author Karen Eiffel (great, great Emma Thompson) who always murders her main characters on the last page of her books. He begins hearing a voice in his head that narrates over his life and tells exactly what just happened to him. Where would you go first? To a psychiatrist, of course. What would he (in this movie, she, Linda Hunt, memorable in a tiny cameo) say? \\"You have to be medicated\\" but she also advises Harold to seek assistance from the literature expert. Enters Dr. Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman, always reliable, always delight to watch) who would help Harold to determine whether he is in a comedy or a tragedy and whether he would be able to avoid an inevitable tragic end of the book. While figuring out if he is in a comedy or a tragedy, Harold meets a free spirited baker with the Harward Law background named Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal lights up the screen in her every scene) who did not pay a portion of her taxes in purpose and now is a subject for auditing. Harold's life changes, he is not ready to go but the voice sounds in his head and his only chance to avoid the book's final is to meet with Karen and to beg her to reconsider. There is a problem, you see - Karen is impossible to find - she never meets with the readers or replies to the phone calls or letters...<br /><br />Little did I know how much I would like the movie and how much I would care about its characters. The movie makers are the brave and creative people not only because they chose as the subject the exploration of Author and his character relationship. It's been done before and not only by Charley Kauffman whose name has been mentioned by many commenters. The subject of Creator and his creature, the writer and the heroes of his books, the man and his shadow that one day would refuse to follow its master would go as far as the ancient Greek myth of Pygmalion and Galatea. No, I admire the filmmakers because they were brave enough to make their main character an IRS guy and to make him sympathetic and compelling. Believe it or not, the movie made me smile and cry at the same time and there were the moments that I could not figure out where it would go and I liked the feeling. I don't know if \\"Stranger than Fiction\\" is the best movie of 2006 but it is certainly the best I've seen so far and it saddens me that it was criminally overlooked during the awards season.<br /><br />...As much as I enjoyed being in the theater with my husband only, I truly wish more viewers saw \\"Stranger than Fiction\\" because it is a clever, funny yet moving picture - they don't come like that very often.<br /><br />4.5/5ts with the readers or replies to the phone calls or letters... <br /> <br />Little did I know how much I would like the movie and how much I would care about its characters.

032147404X|4.0|I've new to SLR cameras and was very intimidated by my new dSLR.  This book does a fabulous job of giving you some basic \\"how-to's\\".  As the product description mentioned, it is like he's out on a shoot with you... I really enjoyed this book.  I also gave it to a friend, another newbie, and she's giving it as a gift to a very talented amateur photographer friend of hers... they both liked the book that much!
B000EWBNMS|5.0|This show is wonderful. It accurately depicts what it's like to \\"be\\" an intuitive... I have worked with the police (as a psychic) & done professional PSI consulting for many years. I am also a screenwriter and feel this show is well written. It captures all the difficulty a psychic faces while trying to live in \\"both\\" worlds. I'm a mom too... and there are times when this \\"gift\\" isn't easy to balance - with family and those around you.<br /><br />So... for any of you who want to know what \\"our\\" lives are like - watch Medium. It's great entertainment - one of the best shows on TV. Believe!
B000JSI7AI|5.0|i loved all the songs on the cd, some were moving and some were just so relaxing....like being in those mountains....
B0000070QS|5.0|I have remained a fan of A-ha's for many years, but only recently learned of Morten's solo albums.  This is the first one I was able to get my hands on, and wow!  There is a depth both to his vocalizations and the music itself, and a wonderful variety of sound.  This is not a cookie cutter album, and Morten makes excellent use of the flexibility that comes with recording solo.  Terrific and insightful lyrics as well.  These songs grab you and won't let go.  My next acquisition will be his Norwegian recording.  I can't wait.  :-)
057506885X|4.0|This is my first Pratchett book and I can think of no other way to describe him than as the Douglas Adams of Fantasy.  It's a very funny book that pokes fun at fantasy and greek myth cliches.
159562015X|5.0|This book and the test really focus on the positive rather than the negative.  It is so helpful for you to see what you may already know but we tend to try and do what we may not be good at.  This identifies our true strengths and it makes you feel very good about where you want to go in your future.  It will help you in all aspects of your life.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Cars is just fun.  Yes, it has a moral, but it is still a fun movie.
4770030096|5.0|This series has been around for 10 years, and I'm glad to see a new version. I've been through the first kana edition, and own the Level II book as well (but stay away from that one). I've already leafed through this new edition at Borders but didn't want to pay the full comver price. It's a totally new format, and the CD is a nice bonus. Same for the workbook. I'm going to purchse this even though I already went through the old version Level I just for the additional practice. Genki is the other book you should have if interested in learning on your own or with a tutor.
B00004RFCM|4.0|Best bargain out there.  Plus, almost every woman loves SATC so it'll be a sure hit if you're clueless as to what to get for that special someone.
006072448X|4.0|Interesting and engaging book, based on a possible path for the formation of a teenage killer. You need to look beyond the \\"teenage killer\\" and think about what creates all those empty, aimless teenagers who don't actually murder a bunch of fellow students. Very thought provoking! I'm surprised by the people who thought the ending (or even the very-ending, last para) was/were unexpected - you can see things coming from early on, and it raises the suspense about exactly what and how.
B000063COX|5.0|1980 was a great year for metal. Not only did Dio come out with Holy Diver his solo debut album, but Maiden came out with their first album, and it sure was a masterpeice. It is easily one of the best debut albums ever. Every track on this album is a classic no fillers at all. sanctuary and the self titled track are still live favorites to this day, and the other classics, running free, prowler, remember tomarrow, and charlet the harlot stand up to the test of time just as brilliantly. and who can forget their first epic song ever, phantom of the opera? awesome. and then there is the weird and slow song strangeword, which leads right into transylvania, IMO their best intrumental.  paul dianno the original vocalist for maiden does an outstanding job on this album and also on their follow up album killers. granted hes no Bruce but then again no one is. But his voice fits perfectly on these first two albums, which IMO had a harder edge than the Bruce era Maiden, which became more melodic.  The only thing bad about this album is the preduction on this one is not as good as all the other albums, which is a pity, but it isnt too intirly noticable.
1401917186|3.0|Read: 2 1/2 stars.    <br /> <br />I picked up this book because I perceived it as a book that would discuss incarnated angels, elementals, wise ones, etc., as archetypes that individuals could relate to.  While this does seem to be its primary intent, I found it hard to take the book seriously, because (as I saw it) the author made a point to stroke the egos of her readers, making it seem like the readers were somehow more \\"extra special\\" than the average person.  It seemed like a shallow attempt to placate the target audience, who are assumed to have had unusually unfair lives, who are misfits, and who would readily and happily be won over by the notion of somehow being intrinsically above and beyond other people.   <br /> <br />While I've no doubt that some people might have a more global purpose in life, or a broader purpose, or a service-oriented purpose, or a more spiritually-oriented focus, I did not appreciate the way the author worded things...  Everyone has a purpose of equal importance.  As I perceived it, the author said things in a way that was so flattering it was practically patronizing.  People should have esteem, and know they have worth, but the book's attempts at expressing these concepts seemed rather artificial to me.
B0006GAI6O|5.0|It is a great movie !!!! and for me the most important thing is to see and enjoy RICHARD GERE.
B000MG1ZGA|4.0|Why did they change it? It sounds good, but I didn't feel it even needed to be remastered. The 99 mixes sound great still. It seems like the vocals were pushed back slightly. I don't like these mixes as much, but maybe they'll grow on me.
B000063DFN|5.0|once again maiden brings it all and creates another masterpiece. aces high is no doubt one of the greatest opening tracks ever, followed by the live favorite 2 minutes to midnight another solid rocker. the middle of the cd is filled with solid songs, that are all pretty much straight forward rockers. then comes powerslave which has one of my favorite solo portions. then it ends with rhynme of the ancient mariner, the second best epic they have. this would be a good introductory album for people new to maiden.  UP THE IRONS!!!
0374525153|4.0|I read this (short) novel originally as an assignment in high school, more than twenty years ago. It moved me then, and as I reread it today I still think is a powerful book. The protagonist of the story is Hans Schwarz, a Jewish boy in high school in the Germany of the early 30s. Hitler is about to take power. The novel narrates as the boy (and his family) slowly starts suffering creeping discrimination, from the teachers and from his fellow students. One of the few friends he has is the aristocratic Konradin von Hohenfels (clearly inspired by Hitler would be assassin Claus von Stauffenberg, as it becomes clear in the last pages of the book). There's not much to it plotwise, but what I like about the book is the sad, melancholy undercurrent throughout the book, as we see a tragedy slowly happening. The book is written as if it were an autobiography, but it is not. Author Fred Uhlman was born in 1901, so it was impossible for him to be a schoolboy in the early 1930s. Note: in 1989, a not so good film version of the novel starring Jason Robards was made.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I had never like Jude Law before this movie, but now I love him. Cameron as always funny and cute, Kate with her beauty and kindness, Jack black is hilarious and last but not least Jude, he's funny, charming and unforgettable, I can't believe this is his first comedy movie. All I can say you must see this movie. I rent it at first (love it)so, last week I decided to order it. Believe me you won't regret to see it!!!!!!!!
B000MG1ZFQ|3.0|I think these are going to actually be the definitive versions. On the doors website it states the 99 mixes will not be replaced once they sell out. Thats kinda of a shame because the music is slightly different. I don't like it as much. The vocals are pushed back. It still sounds great though. The package is nice with the bonus tracks and lyrics.
B000063DFQ|5.0|Many a maiden fan will tell you that this is the best maiden cd out there. well i disagree, but i can understand why they would think this. here is why i dont think its the best album maiden has to offer. In my opinion, where as my two favorite albums, Numbers and seventh son are strong throughout the entirety of the cd, i feel piece of mind kind of ends on a week note. where eagles dare is a thunderous and powerful introduction song, and a great welcoming boom from new drummer Nicko Mcbrain. Revelations is an instant classic and is still played live to this day. Flight of icarus is another strong entry which for some reason steve harris doesnt like it and refuses to play it live. die with your boots on is a straight forward rocker that does just that rocks. and then there is the trooper. I belive I said the same thing about wrathchild in my killers review, but ill say it again for this song. Worth the cost of the cd for this song alone. still life is the last great song on the album. slower paced but cool as hell. then this is where the album is week. quest for fire, sun and steel (Conan?) and to tame a land although are decent, i dont think they are anywhere near Maidens other premium stuff, and to tame a land as an epic doesnt come close to Hallowed, Seventh son or Rhyme standards. UP THE IRONS!!!
B000JLTRIG|5.0|As all the seasons of charmed, I really loved this one as well...Thanks alot
B00003CXMG|5.0|this is my favorite movie of all time. basically its about a boy that just loves music, and he went to a radio station and was given a report to write about a band, and he goes to a concert. ends up getting in with a band called still water and goes on tour with them and tries to interview them. if anyone hasnt seen this movie, its a must have. especially for the price
B000M341QO|5.0|Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Leonardo Dicaprio at their best!  A great cop, gangster movie with a well developed plot.  If you didn't see it at the movies,  you missed out.  Is a good movie to own. Will want to watch over and over.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Ever After has to be one of my favorite movies of all time, and probably will be for a long time.  I just find that there aren't very many movies around these days that uplift and inspire like Ever After does.  One thing that makes a movie great is if you are willing to watch it more that once, and that's one of the reasons why I bought it.  Sure it may be just another Cinderella story, but they really did a great job bringing it out of animation.  The actors were great, I can't tell you which ones because I'm horrible on remembering actors names, but they did a terrific job.  This movie definetly is for the entire family because it is free of profanity, excessive violence, and other things that degrade movies.  I would definetly recommend it to anyone, even if you've already seen it once.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|Brandi,Great Album.  Much better production sound than the first. Of course nothing is better than hearing Brandi and the Twins play live. Brandi and the Twins are truly at their best live-and-in-person..... Thanks again for a CD to recommend for my friends. <br /> <br />DougG.
0393327655|5.0|It was very thought provoking, raising questions as to the changing face of religion
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|It's perfect...love the period pieces and Masterpiece Theatre does a wondeful job with them.
6305907145|1.0|<br />The characters are not appealing and the story is not interesting. An effort to watch. Make-up, dyed hair, costumes poorly done. One man's eyebrows, the suitor's, are altered like a woman's! No scenery or homes of interest, except a glance at the sailing ships in the harbor. Not a pleasant pace, without humor, without intrigue. A lesbian undertone in one scene.  <br /> <br />The only positive thing I can think of is this good line of Jane Austen, quoted. Fanny sums up in one sentence, why she will not marry him. Women who have spent hours within romance in uncertainty, will wish to sum up their certainty with Ms. Austen's line: \\"His sole interest is in being loved, not in loving\\". This line is an exception to a lifeless script.  <br />There, now you do not need to endure the painful movie. Here are two lines re-written by me: For the woman dealing with a trifling man: \\"No man suffers pains of love on the stage.\\" For dealing with the infatuated man: \\"You have wounded yourself, but not with love.\\"  <br /> <br />This movie should be re-made by someone sharing the ideals of Jane Austen. There is plenty to be mined from the novel to create a pleasant film, humorous, with singing, with interest. A movie can take the best of the book, in the spirit of the book, which this movie did not carry, and make a movie better than the book. This movie is bad any which way.  <br /> <br />Well-made period romance films are: \\"Pride & Prejudice 2005, 1996, & 1940\\", \\"Wives & Daughters\\", \\"North & South\\". Fairly made is \\"Under the Greenwood Tree\\". I rated \\"Persuasion\\" at 2-stars for the wooden acting; however \\"Persuasion\\" is 5-stars compared to this \\"Mansfield Park\\". \\"Persuasion\\" has attractive scenery, costumes, beautiful singing, and an uplifting plot; though of interest only to women, preferably who have already read the book.  <br />
B000N6U0E2|5.0|The chemistry between Will Smith and his real son who stars in this makes this movie very special.  I don't think another child actor could have pulled it off as well.  Most of the movie is factual, but the age of the child was 2 and not 5 as in the movie.  Also I find it hard to believe that he would have twice lost the scanning machines he was trying to sell and then able to recover them both times (or was it 3 times)?  Several reviewers complained that the movie did not show much of the happy part of his life, but it wasn't necessary because you know that once he lands the job at Dean Whitter that he will be just fine, especially knowing the sacrifices that he went through to get it.  Some say this is Will Smith's best performance yet and it may well be.  He was very convincing in the role and nothing was over done or under done.  His kid was cute without being precocious or too smart.  The relationship between father and son couldn't have been done any better.  This is not a movie about overcoming racism, but in Chris Gardner's own words, it's about overcoming \\"Placeism\\".  By that he means being born in a poor family without influence or advantage and no money of his own and having to overcome those disadvantages.  The real Chris Gardner is a great role model for those who think they can't make it in this world because of who they are, the color of their skin, what they do or don't start with or where they come from.  One of the best lines in the movie is when Chris (Smith) tells his son: \\"Don't ever let anyone tell you that you can't do something--not even me\\".  The bonus features are nice, especially learning about the Italian director who could barely speak English and getting to see and hear the real Chris Gardner.  The movie is a little long and even though you know that he gets the job in the end, it is still an emotional scene and one of the best in the movie when he finally gets told.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|This is excellent DVD video collection. Very good picture quality and sounds. Worth to purchase it. Do not think twice.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|Brandi Carlile is one of my favorite singers ever. With a voice that has the resonance of Patsy Cline and with a slight croon, she never fails to convey any emotion she wants to get across. I think The Story improves on her already fabulous debut album. There's the more contemporary \\"My Song,\\" the country-ish \\"The Story,\\" the traditional folk of \\"Have You Ever,\\" and spare but catchy ballads like \\"Turpentine.\\" Her rootsiness sometimes explodes into an almost punk guitar attack, giving her more of an edge. The lyrics don't let that voice down, either. Very highly recommended!
B00003JRCQ|2.0|This version is much better than the 2008 version. I am a guy who likes period films such as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", but this is a Chick-Flick that only women can understand. So women may not like my review.    A film that many women, with fancifulness, make enjoyable.     Pretty scenery, such as walks along the ocean. The costumes are often exceptional. There is wonderful singing in one scene and over the closing credits.     Men will find the characters, including Anne & the Captain, display wooden acting, often poker-faces. Others speak at a clipped pace. The properness of the times allowed for personality, as shown well in \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" 1940, 1996 & 2006, but not here. Shyness, plainness, or slowness, may be portrayed likeably, with some personality; but not here.     Both Anne & the Captain maintain wide-eyed, desperate, looks, constantly. Many of us do get nervous within romance; but we are compelled, by conversation and activity, to interrupt our nervousness with personality. Thus, Anne's & the Captain's constant, wide-eyed, nervousness is un-natural. All of us at the age of Anne and the Captain, would have refined our nervousness, clearly showing: shyness, or thought, or distance, or hopefulness, or approval, or alarm.     You understand the quiet thoughts, because of the story, in spite of the confusing, paralyzed, looks; rather than because of them. You come to like Anne and the Captain toward the end, in spite of the wooden acting, because of the story.     Another reviewer refers to important background from the book that is not in the film; thus a poor script for those who have not read the book. Good period, romance films are so few, and so desired, that many women, who have read the book, work and imagine an enjoyable film; better than it really is. I applaud their positive imaginations. However, they could not help but continue their imaginative thoughts into rating the poor directing of this film.     I would like to see this good story idea re-made by a better director.     Well-made romance films are: \\"Pride & Prejudice 1940, 1996, 2006\\", \\"Wives & Daughters\\", \\"North & South\\", and \\"Naughty Marietta 1935 with Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy\\". Fairly made is \\"Under the Greenwood Tree\\".
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|I love the music from this group.  It is so lively for some of them but also soothing for some of the other songs
B000053GTF|5.0|This is excellent DVD video collection. Very good picture quality and sounds. Worth to purchase it. Do not think twice.
1560100842|5.0|I bought this book several years ago, around 1999, and for its price (or whatever) it's the best book an animator can begin with. Along with The Illusion of Life, it is a must have book for all animators. It taught me the differences between the \\"cute\\" types and the \\"screwball\\" types, showed how the stopwatch and metronome are used, and even a few things about clean-up. If you love cartoons, by all means GET THIS BOOK!
B000MTPANQ|5.0|The hyperbole bestowed upon this disc is warranted.  Captured in an imtimate setting before the release of Harvest, Live At Massey Hall is a sonic treasure, delivering the goods with a strong performance, great set, and wonderful sound quality.  The DVD portion is also a treat and one can immediately see the great care taken in syncing up the archival footage to the music.  A must-have for any Neil fan!
B00007J5VN|5.0|Some of my favorite BOB FOSSE CHOREOGRAPHY combined with absolutlely perfect costomes by the phenomenal Edith Head.  Shirly MacLaine is, as always lovable, funny, and awesome.  And Sammy Davis Jr.'s number is one of my favorite songs in a movie.  I own this beause it's filled with gems.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|\\"What the world needs now, is love sweet love.\\"  After alot of enjoyable (to me at least) meandering through the clever plot, we get the funamental message at the end - Its a beautiful thing when people take care of each other.  Here are some of the other delightful messages:<br /><br />You can learn alot about how to enjoy life from rock lyrics.<br /><br />You can change the world with good cookies.<br /><br />Great writing is always a treat.<br /><br />Wearing a bra is highly overrated.<br /><br />Giving a girl flours.  Who knew?<br /><br />Never take yourself too seriously.<br /><br />The real power of this movie is Maggie Gyllenhaal (spelling?).  She is intense; like spilled red paint on Harold's dark suit.<br /><br />But there was plenty of good acting and writing - Dustin Hoffman reprised his role in \\"I Heart Huckabees.\\"  I enjoyed the graphics on the screen, and the oddball music...was a perfect reinforcement of the story.<br /><br />\\"You mean the letter that begins, Dear Emperialist Swine:?\\"<br /><br />\\"I'm odd/awed.\\"<br /><br />Well done.  I'll look into other work by this director and this writer.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|[[ASIN:B000ANVQ0K Titanic (Special Collector's Edition)]] <br /> <br />Really great. and awesome deleted scenes
0451196716|5.0|This book is full of suspense.  I honestly didn't think I would enjoy a book about 100 boys walking themselves to death, but before I knew it, I was enthralled. <br /> <br />I've now read 2 of the Bachman Books.  I've enjoyed each one immensely.  The book is not a difficult read.  Not overly wordy compared to some of King's works.   <br /> <br />I'd reccommend this to anyone who enjoys a good read.
B000059GEH|5.0|This is a great movie, hard to find as well.  Shipping was as suggested, item is excellent shape.  very pleases with this transaction.
B00003CX5P|4.0|This movie was fabulously entertaining on all character's introductions, starting with the young almost-grown Oki-Wan Kenobi and the kid Anakin Skywalker through their mentor, the entrance of Palpatine in both roles as the cowled Darth Sidious and newly-elected Chancellor of the Republic; I would love to see novels featuring both teacher and pupil as well as the arch-villain, plus their companion, Jar-Jar Binks for a comical touch of support! In others words, the movie was enchanting to watch from the escape of Queen Amadila to the battles!
0446677450|1.0|I know the cheerleaders will shout me down, but the advice in here is like the Sphinx in \\"Mystery Men.\\"  \\"To go forward, you must go back.  To see without, you must look within.\\"  It's a mix of self-referential catchphrases and false syllogisms.    He contradicts his own \\"examples\\" and anecdotes repeatedly, and blatantly lies about his military background, while impugning the military as a whole.  Kiyosaki is a former Merchant Marine officer (sort of) who lateraled to the Navy and the Marines picked up in another lateral transfer at the end of Vietnam.  He claims to have been a combat helicopter pilot (or fighter pilot.  The story changes) but his records are available online and are pretty generic.  He certainly had no \\"right\\" or \\"Duty\\" to kill a small local boy he found in his helicopter.  It would violate Geneva 3 and 4 and the UCMJ.  He then claims to have deserted the military.  His actual records reflect none of this.  This makes the whole section suspect.  Heck of an honorable guy, here, and what does any of this have to do with investing?    Utter crap.  Want a better use for your money?  Take the money you'd spend on this book, and put it into the equity in your house, or buy a silver eagle, or a box of candy.
1582701709|5.0|I heard a lot about this book.  It has really made me think differently.  I highly recommend this book to everyone.  Great book!!!
