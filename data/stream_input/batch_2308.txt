B005XBKXV2|4.0|Good.  Music and the speech accent of the baboon gives it an exotic flavor.  Disney films have parent deaths and a kind of scary villians more often than I like and this is another one of those. I think it's unnecessary.  Children are amazed by anything new to their everyday experiences so the plot doesn't have to be so defined.  And, if there is a bad guy, he doesn't have to be REALLY scary.  I'm into bumbling bad guys like Captain Hook.  Always a nice lesson incorporated somehow, though - And enough humor to lighten.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|With only 60 seconds to play each game, the time passes quickly.  The ticking clock is a little annoying and it would be better if there were some other options on playing the game.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|Wow I vcan't believe this is the book we all hsve been waiting for. This was bad. The characters lacked depth. The story line seemed to drag on and then end with a sucky ending. It seemed incomplete.  I expected Lena to finally start kicking some real azz and taking names. Didnt happen.  Her meet up with Hana, her mom, alex, grace were all disappointments.
B0091REZMW|5.0|great game, lots of levels and so far hadn't had to buy a thing keeps the whole family busy for hours even the toddler plays
B00BF11STU|3.0|Makes me proud to be an American., and having served many years ago. Great action. I would recommend this if you aren't too much of historically accurate
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|This is a masterful film.  There is no part of it that is either over the top or boring.  Most people probably need to see it more than once, to fully understand things.  At a little over 2-1/2 hours, the film is longish, but it covers a lot of things and covers them well.  The acting is spot on and all the cast were well chosen.  They are all believable.  Jessica Chastain is superb.  The screenplay and direction are both excellent and set the perfect tone for the subject matter.
0486274268|5.0|Written by a master, this vast guide is a great visual encyclopedia for moderate-advanced artists. Hultgren breaks each animal down into basic shapes and skeletons with useful insight and annotations. I've purchased several animal books, but this one is by far the best. In fact, we're using this as a textbook for my graduate-level illustration course at The Academy of Art University, so I know I'm not the only one to feel this way.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Enough people have critiqued the movie.  You either like what Peter Jackson did, or you don't.  I liked it.<br /><br />So lets go on to the product.  There are two important differences between what I saw at the Grauman's Chinese Theater and at home.  My TV is much smaller and my living room isn't as fancy.  The 3D blu ray faithfully reproduced the color balance and saturation I saw at the theater.  I saw no artifacts or scenes that lacked depth.  The 2D blu ray version benefits from the way Jackson set scenes up to take advantage of 3D.  They appear to have depth you generally don't sense in 2D.<br /><br />I think most fans of Tolkien will enjoy this despite the inevitable variances from the book.
B003A8FESM|1.0|We received the DVD very promptly, looked in good working order but when we went to play it, we got an error message in our player.  I attempted to load it on my computer and found that it won't work because it is not for US DVD players.  Something about we are in region 1 and the DVD is for region 2 which includes Japan and Saudi Arabia.  Definitely not advertised when I bought it and wouldn't have ordered it.  Trying to return it but may have gone pass the return date.  Waiting to hear back from seller.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|The cinematography, scenery, sets and direction are all excellent.  The acting efforts of Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathawy are outstanding.  Russell Crowe is a credible Javert, but there are two problems.  He doesn't sing well and the key he is singing in just isn't something that works.  Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter play themselves well...as they usually do.<br /><br />I must confess that I am not a fan of musicals and think this one, in particular isn't well suited to music, even though some of the music is listenable.
B0091LS07E|5.0|This was a present for my daughter who is a huge fan of Alicia Keys.....such a talented young artist.....hope to get more of her music.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Answered many questions for me. Easy to read and understand. I could see in my mind the events as they took place. Americans need to understand the sacrifice these folks make for us.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I like the story and the characters, but it did not keep my interest.  The story is an interesting attempt at utopia but lacks substance.
B000EQHHJW|4.0|First off, I have to admit I think the plot of Rigoletto is ridiculous.  And -- for those who will protest -- no, the plots of many great operas are NOT ridiculous. Second, the production values were way over the top in this DVD, and although occasionally, the settings were wonderful, they were also absurd.  Third, the singer of Gilda just couldn't act, nor was she pretty (when one of the courtiers exclaimed, &#34;Beautiful!&#34; I was attempted to shout back, &#34;Get glasses!&#34;)  However, the singing is glorious.  Pavarotti is amazing (and he knows it). Wixell is a terrific Rigoletto -- and, in his case, a bit of overacting doesn't hurt, and Gruberova's voice is stunning.  The orchestra is also terrific.  The DVD is worth it for Pavarotti alone, in my opinion -- he is at his prime, and he makes the well-worn Duke's arias alive and gloriously, insolently new.
B002HSSAY6|5.0|Undoubtedly among the greatest of this genre!  I would have suggested a small twist to the ending - instead of Bronson shown to win his final duel, the outcome could have been kept a secret, leaving it to the audience!  Of course they would have revolted- good has to win surely; except in modern corporate America..:)
B000Y0Q5NM|4.0|I like the plot. Good action. It is not too violent, and so far it has kept me wanting to see the next episode.
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|This album grows on you like a fungus. The worst song on the album is the melancholy song he released as a single.<br /><br />Each song seems to capture a certain era/sound in Bowie's career, but this does not feel like a retread or collection of B-sides. He takes each song in exciting and different directions. Totally recommended.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|This was the first movie that we rented to watch on our High Def TV. Excellent plot as all 007 movies have been.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I think you need to have flint an  steel on creative mode a long with being able  to open crafting tables. You also need night time in creative and villagers
B00BWJARHO|1.0|Another classic ruined by Peter Jackson's greed and idiocy.  First he decided that the Lord of the Rings needed dwarf tossing jokes.  In his remake of King Kong, he decides that Kong should go ice skating in Central Park.  Now he's added idiotic and unneeded characters to the Hobbit.  Did the gratuitous addition of a wizard covered in moist bird crap really improve the original story?  Nope.  Did adding unneeded new plotlines improve the original story?  Nope.  But I guess if you want to stretch a 250 page book into 3 three hour movies, you need lots and lots of filler.  Peter Jackson has sunk even lower than George Lucas.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I enjoyed the characters very much.  It's a really good story with a lot of ups and downs. I have recommended this series to others.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I really dislike the governor so much that it is beyond the typical \\"love to hate\\" relationship. Andrea is almost as bad. At this point, I still love the show, but I am really looking forward to the governor, hopefully, being killed by one of my favorite characters in a horrible way.
B00846REIS|5.0|I read this after finishing 50 Shades series.  It was a good follow up to that series.  The characters were different, but similar in certain areas.  I'm looking forward to the 3rd book as I've already read the 2nd.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Confusing...it reminded me of poltergeist.  Just watch and you'll see some likeness when the human images appear.  The story line is weak.  From a line of another movie: &#34;I've been better films on teeth.&#34;  One star for that....the extra star is for the CGI.
0385344333|5.0|Bought the book because I didn't want to wait for the paperback. And I'm a Jack Reacher junkie. (The Movie did NOT make me very happy)  Expected 'as new' and it was. Arrived in 4-5 days instead of 10-12 as expected, very well protected in the mailer and not a mark or scuff anywhere to be found. Overall this is probably the best experience with a bookseller that I've ever  had. I will definitely be buying from them again.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Very slow out of the gate! Just hit level 5 an it took 5 days. Hope it picks up or I won't continue.
B004LROUNG|3.0|Enough character development to keep it interesting. Typical Grisham of lowly lawyers in over their heads. Somewhat predictable ending. Story moves along well.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I found it awkward to use, you have to look at the front of the camera to take a picture
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Much closer to the general Jack Ryan theme, with the usual caste of characters. Better than the narrow theme of Dead or Alive, which uses the Net Force special ops themes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is better than Temple run.Also I think that the Easter one in Rome is fun and that is why I love Subway Surfers
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book kept me guessing throughout, and was an emotional adventure  through the characters. A page turner leaving you hopeful that time will heal the families, an  more importantly Chris.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Awesome upgrade of the first temple run.Graphics are way better cool new track and over all a lot of fun!I highly recommend this.
B00270WH3Y|5.0|Great album. love it! Brings back a lot of memories. highly recommended. You'll love every single song on it! Good listening for all.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I originaly wanted this game because I had it on my phone.Its a good game and fun not a lot of glitches but it freezes often.If you like games that keep you playing get this
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This is really good book and I would recommend everyone to read it. I love reading true stories like this one especially when it has a happy ending. The fact that she wrote it herself instead of having someone else do it made me feel more connected to the story.<br /><br />I can't even begin to imagine what I would have done if this happened to me or how I would be able to handle it if it happened to one of my kids. No parent wants their child to go through something like this. Growing up I've heard more stories than I can count about kids being kidnapped so I have to say that's been my biggest worry when it comes my kids. I know I can't be protective like this forever but I know no matter what I will always worry about them and protect them as long as I can.
B0026KX5PO|5.0|Love this book and enjoyed watching the movie.  There are a whole series of the books I just ordered on Audible.com.  Looking forward to my long drive!
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Just enjoying re-watch the old shows. Been enjoying looking at it on my Kindle Fire HD system. Great Viewing-Great, Great
0062231375|5.0|This book is a delight. I laughed and cried while reading it. There are so many tips and recommendations it's kind of like an enciclopedia. Highly recommended!
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|I guess I dont understand all the complaining about this DVD. The editing is great, the sound is great & the 40 minute History of Iron Maiden Part 3 is great. It covers all the bases. Those who bitch are to picky. If your a Maiden fan or a fan of good metal...Buy This DVD!!!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|An incredible story that humanizes the WWII history and reminded me that there were true heros on both sides of the battle. Because the primary focus of the story is from the German soldier's experience, I sometimes found it emotionally challenging to read the descriptions of air battles won by the German fighter pilot aces that resulted in the loss of Allied pilots and soldiers who could easily have been my grandfather. However, the author does an excellent job of filling in the back story of an incredible man who, in the midst of hell, recognized the humanity of the enemy and made a heroic decision to help.
B00BEWCJFM|5.0|Fantastic soundtack to the Maiden England 88 DVD. I love the setlist on this cd and its for sure to get a lot of listens for me. If you are a Maiden fan or like good live metal, Maiden England 88 is for you! Up The Irons!!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game is very inventive, combinations are vaired and interesting. There's always more than 1 way to get to an element and some are based more on words than common sense. For example early on if you combine fire and water you gain alcohol or 'firewater'. I believe this is an interesting concept.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|This was so predictable and thrown together.  Sometimes I like his work-- for a quick chick lit read.  This was just way too sugary.  You kind of figured out the gist by maybe the third page.  Seems like Mr. Sparks had to just throw something together and this was it.  Kind of a waste of time.
B00A8KJK7G|4.0|My girls cried at parts, and were scared also. But, my son and I loved it. Very cute, I think it is for older children though.
B009VB97EY|5.0|Waited to see this at ome in case it wasn't worth the $$ at a theater.......it was well worth it!
B00B99KJR0|4.0|with good graphics (for Kindle Fire anyhow) and a story line.  I also own Call of Atlantis, and am<br /> looking forward to other games this dev puts out.  I like the minimal permissions and lack of IAP.  This is a definitely a game I would let children play on my device.  Recommended for those that like match-3 type games.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I loved this movie!  Funny, suspensful, action packed and just plain great!  Loved Benn Afflect and acting was top notch.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|NOTE: Mulan is missing(probable not considered as a princess of China). When U get the product- it stinks but after 1 day being stick on the wall the smell disappears.Easy to stick, peel off and stik again.! My dauhter loves it!!!
B00BR476TG|5.0|I read this book years ago , and absolutely love the story. I do not know of a movie trailer that got me so excited to see a movie. It is visually beautiful. I a little worried, as some movies made from books just do not get it \\"right\\". This movie really does. Of course the movie doesn't cover everything that happened in the book, but it does cover enough to tell the story and convey the strong emotions that it should. I really enjoyed this movie, it will be one that I watch over and over for years to come.
0812982622|5.0|What a wonderful novel--one of the most powerful I've read in a long time.  I was so compelled to get to the end that I woke up ridiculously early in the morning needing to finish the last 50 pages or so before I could get my mind off it.  And now that I've finished, I still can't get my mind off of it.  Doesn't seem fair.<br /><br />Johnson has created a story of both tenderness and brutality.  I cared deeply about some of the characters and despised others, which was certainly the author's intention.  The story of Pak Jun Do and his various transformations under the totalitarian gaze of the North Korean state apparatus and, in the end, the Dear Leader Kim Jong Il himself, is full of so much tragedy and helplessness that Johnson's humor and sarcasm could seem misplaced.  The story of Jun Do, whose father is the master of an orphanage and whose mother left before the boy could develop any real attachment to her except in his hopes, starts out straightforwardly enough, but it soon begins to take on tones that are both darker and more ominous.  He is trained in subterranean combat in total darkness, becomes part of a team whose mission is to kidnap Japanese citizens, spends time on a fishing boat listening to the airwaves at night, and ultimately, like so many subjects of the totalitarian state, enters the maw of its insatiable gulag system.  But that's not the end of the story.  Not by a long way.<br /><br />The novel mixes intrigue, humor, love, and tragedy in an unlikely but very powerful combination.  It takes a little while to see what Johnson is doing, but stick with it.  The writing is so strong that even the bizarreness of some of the scenes (beginning with the diplomatic mission to Texas) is completely compelling.  Part Two of the book (\\"The Confession of Commander Ga\\") is very complex, narrated from at least four different points of view.  I found this just slightly confusing at first, but the confusion resolved itself quickly and I found the approach both effective and surprisingly moving.<br /><br />Anyone who wants to write about North Korea has to find the right entry point.  Johnson has focused on the multiple ways in which lives and identities are lost, including the question of what a person gives up in order not to attract the unwanted attention of the paternalistic state and its brutal machinery of security and forced conformity.  Though he invents all the specific situations, he draws from the reality of what is known about North Korea.  More importantly, the book has the unmistakable ring of emotional truth.  It's the best thing I've read so far this year.  Can I give it 6 stars?
0689505698|5.0|Love this story for my preschool students. I read many story variations of The Three Little Pigs and this is one of my favorites. Good story to teach about bullying.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|its tottaly awesome long downloading time but totally worth it I. llllllllllllllooooooooovvvvvvveeeeee it download this app if you love pony's get it getit now
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I chose this rating because this book is worthy of it.<br /><br />There is nothing that I disliked about this book. All the characters personalities are so unique.<br /><br />Riordan is king of Greek and Roman mythology.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|fun with friends while you gain points and gems to give yourself bonuses. Very addicted and player friendly. try it yourself
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When I first heard about subway I thought we'll I thought it was a train run but when I got it it was fun and did you know that when it's a different holiday it changes like Easter it changes awesome I hope you enjoy it it's very AMAZING and FUN.you can buy it at Amazon or the app store!
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Engaging and thought provoking. One of my all time favorite book. I'm  looking forward to discussing it at book club.
B005NKGEP2|2.0|Slow moving. Redundant . Movers back and forth in time without great effect. Ending is somewhat surprising but depends upon an unlikely leap of faith.
B00BSBU4EC|2.0|I downloaded this on my kindle fire and watched it.  It was a cute story about how Jack Frost got his start...cute characters.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|My wife and I both enjoyed this latest Grisham novel. The story is quite plausible, and there's a great twist, which makes the ending very satisfactory. I may be wrong, but I feel that with John Grisham being a lawyer, he builds real-life scenarios into his novels, from his personal experiences, which makes his novels interesting, as well as exciting.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I bought all of season one for my Kindle Fire and I love re-watching them.  I will also get all of Season Two.  I watch them on my Kindle Fire so that my two sons aren't put thru the agony of my constant viewing!!!
B007FG9LIE|2.0|This is a well written story,  I'm not sure I like the style.  It was very frustrating for me to read, a lot of things didn't make sense. I didn't have the patience for what I thought was a bunch of bull.  I totally ignored the long drawn out italicized passages wanting to get to the meat of the story.<br /><br />At the beginning it kind of made me think of Salem's Lot by S. King because I wasn't sure what was going on.  Then it just ticked me off, by not giving me any answers.  I almost deleted it several times but I was so angry at author for yanking my chain I kept going.  My overall opinion is I wasted my time and I will not be reading other books by this guy.<br /><br />I like a good start but I don't like being teased like a cat with a ball of string.  If you like lots of mystery and questions you might enjoy this.  For all the work he did setting it up the ending was a big disappointment and rather abrupt.
B008RJFRTK|1.0|Maps are out of date,even using GPS location does not show current info. And it does not give you a search feature to input an address and locate it. Would have been better off buying a paper map. A waste of time and money.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|love this alarm clock if you sleep through this ur dead very loud and distinctive, no back ground noise even matches it, so if you fall asleep with the tv on it will still scare you awake  its great
B007BT0RKG|1.0|Out of date user interface and information what a waste of time pass this one up for sure.you will regret it
B005K01VZS|4.0|I was blessed reading this book. It will uplift you whatever your faith background. As a Christian, I was blessed by the Rabbi's insights. It shows the power of redemption in the life of the Christian minister.<br /><br />Christian or Jewish believers will be blessed reading this book.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|Of all the Kindle covers I have purchased this is by far the very best!!! The functionality is terrific. It will provide excellent protection for my Kindle even better than it shipping packaging in the long run. The strap is very innovative!!<br /><br />Morgan Douglas
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Kept me guessing until the end. The character's memory loss caused her to start over every morning.  Very good book!
055357342X|5.0|This is one of those rare books where, while reading it, you realize you are experiencing a one in a lifetime entertainment experience. Parts are so stunning, so wildly shocking, that at times I stopped reading and stared blankly at the wall for several minutes while my wife looked at me like I was insane.<br /><br />Martin is a rare breed. He has the ability to create terrific prose, realistic and fascinatingly flawed characters, and an imagination that is every bit as huge as the world he has created. But he never overdoes it. Rather, he keeps the story focused on the interweaving plotlines of the characters of Westeros. The twists and turns never stop coming, yet they never seem forced as well. There's a random sort of chaos going on at times, much like the real world in which we live. You just can't see what's coming. Little hints may appear, yet, not surprisingly, nothing is laid out in black and white. A Song of Ice and Fire is, after all, known as the books that started the Gray characters in fantasy fiction. There is no white versus black, or good versus evil. Everyone has some good and bad in them, although some more than others.<br /><br />All three of these books are A plus quality, and I am just starting book four. But if someone asked me to hand over one book that would show how amazing Fantasy fiction can be, I would give them Storm of Swords.<br /><br />Just read it.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this game! It is a great app. The pets are so cute and playful. You will love it!
1741798981|5.0|Lonely Planet Guides are excellent.  We use them every time we go to Europe.<br />Can't find our way around without it!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I had never heard of this author but gave this book a try based on the concept. I was stunned at how well written and researched this book was! This is not a kindle single but a full length scifi novel of survival on mars. I literally could not put this down and raced through it with a &#34;what's going to happen next?&#34; kind of enthusiasm. My only gripe is that the endless overuse of profanity gets tiresome after a while-otherwise I would have given five stars.
B007W1BLN0|5.0|Very moving and haunting. Didn't have a happy ending like most movies do.  The movie &#34;sticks&#34; with you. Excellent characterization.
B0041CGOZS|5.0|I wish I had known there was an Ultimate Greatest Hits with an extra CD but this one is great.
B0000009SY|5.0|I purchased this for a friend as a Christmas gift. He recently &#34;discovered&#34; Frank and was excited when he received it.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|if you are looking for an easy read, packed with adventure and twists then this book is for you.The story is fast moving and full of action.The first book of the series introduces the main characters and the story line which is easy going.This is one of those books you will have trouble putting down.Or if you are a busy person like myself you can put it down for a few days and jump right back into it.This is a great read.
B0016PM722|5.0|My son was ecstatic when he purchaed this. Even more so we he actually received it and got to try it out.
B009P14AOW|5.0|When I was 13, I would rush home to play this wonderful masterpiece. Originally in lp, It was well played, and never a scratch, snap, crackle or pop :-) Keith Emerson, Greg Lake, and Carl Palmer were the kings of Classical Rock. This album features many pieces that were so ahead of their time, if this classic were re-relesed today it would still be current....40 years on. Such was the quality of music in those days. The opening track is 'Jerusalem', words by visionary poet William Blake, and to this day is my fave version. I think it has to be experienced, to really do it justice....enjoy :-)
B009O2XY12|4.0|Except this mommy gets timed out mostly.  But it's a really cute game with nice animated graphics.  Enjoy playing it.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|A fantastic classic horror! A little truth and history mixed with exceptional imagination. Excellent story with great detail and riveting suspense. Beware, the terrible Count Dracula will haunt your dreams.
B004LZFWJO|4.0|I got this instead of Candy Crush Saga which is advertised but unavailable on Kindle - nice to have that too - false advertising? Anyway, it keeps you busy enough. I've set it to an untimed game and it whiles away the time.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|There are numerous reviews expounding on the art, depth, and beauty of this film and story, so I do not wish to add to this body of reviews with more of the same. I only would like to add a note for those really wanting information about the quality of singing, but hearing so much negativity. I have never written a review regarding film, song, or any other medium.<br /><br />I was raised in a musical family. My grandfather actually had the most popular band in our city for a long time. Every member of my mother's family was expected to contribute musically. I grew up loving to sing, but was very shy of singing alone in front of people. When I entered middle school I earned a place on first soprano in my school choir. I enjoyed being in a group of singers, and remained throughout my academic career until graduation. I also have always loved musicals - which made me very odd among many of my peers. The reason I give this background is because I want people to understand that I do know what I am speaking about.<br /><br />I have read numerous reviews regarding the singing in this film that have, honestly, left me scratching my head in wonder. From a choral perspective, and from the perspective of one raised around music and musicals, I disagree with every single negative review I have read. Firstly, every single singer in this film sang perfectly. I understand some people want \\"operatic\\" singers. But, let me ask, why in the world would anyone want to see a film in opera? To be perfectly honest, I am not a huge fan of the opera. I do not believe this story was intended for Opera. Secondly, I will more than admit that there were broken notes. However, I must contend that this makes the performance that much more touching and sincere. Tell me, what singer can truly sing through their torment? I'm sorry. Personally, if I were singing a song because my heart were being wrenched from my body, I do believe my voice might crack at moments -- and I sang in competition. Excuse me for not being perfect? Could you sing any better? My point? The singing in the film version is sheer perfection. Never have I been so moved by a musical performance. And yes, there are many great musicals out there. But, this all began as a story. I love that the characters did not try to put on a \\"stage performance\\". This isn't meant to be a stage performance! This is a moving, heart wrenching story that deserves real emotion.<br /><br />Les Miserables has my full appreciation and approval. I would love to see anyone else perform these songs with such depth of real emotion as these actors and actresses infused within their music.<br /><br />As for Amanda Seyfried, she was meant to be like a bird, and she came across beautifully.<br /><br />As for the negative reviews about Crowe. I believe Crowe's singing might could be better. However, I stand behind him for this part solely because I believe his vocals portrayed Javert perfectly. I found Javert a bit straight laced and boring. Although, understand that this is his face value. Javert had depth of character, but he was very stoic. That, of course, is a subjective opinion.<br /><br />My suggestion is to read the story and form your own opinion from that, keeping in mind that this is meant to condense the story by providing the momentous events and allowing music and lyrics to help move us through the emotional content. However, please do not claim people are not singing on key when you have not personally attended years of choral / vocal practice. Since hearing such reviews I have taken pains to listen to every single song and determine if it were sung on key. I entirely disregard any cracked notes performed solely for the sake of emotion. Prime example would be Jackman's \\"Valjean's Soliloquy\\", and especially where he sings, \\"One word from him and I'd be back, beneath the lash upon the rack\\". That is emotion people, come on!
B004XUMMFE|4.0|It is a fun show, just wish there was more of it.  A lot of good storylines could have been followed.
0765325950|5.0|I started reading Robert Jordan's books in Middle school and I was hooked. I haven't been able to read science fiction since then, even game of thrones. To me, he said everything I wanted to hear about in a science fiction series. Over time Jordan did start to falter; adding far too many characters that just didn't push the story far. Yet if you did keep track of them it opened up the universe more, so it was a mixed bag.<br />  So here we are at Jordan/Sanderson's last entry. I liked what Sanderson did, he kept Jordan's detailed and intricate/lavish/awesome style but in a more focused fashion for the better. I had been waiting for this book since book 12, and when I got it I was so sucked in I finished it in a few days. That's just what this series does to me; I usually can pace myself but I didn't want to wait anymore I had to know.<br />Tarmon Gaiden is here; this book starts off with fighting and keeps the pressure on. Finally everyone is one: Rand, Egwene, Perrin, Mat, Moiraine, Lan, Nynaeneve etc. Rand finally makes good on what he said, to challenge the dark one. Without giving anything away I like how they decided to take the book. All out war for everyone else and Rand &#34;confronting&#34; the dark one. No spoilers given, there were some of the series best moments in this book. Like when Rand realized he never heard voices at all; he learns more about himself from his friends and family and that is his biggest edge in the battle. I'll admit, I man teared at a few parts of the reading it was just incredible. I think this book just ruined my chances of ever reading another science fiction series.<br />  All in all, I can't recommend this book enough to anyone if you've read the others. But if you didn't like the previous 2 (shame on you), then this may not be your cup of tea. Oh and that ending? buildup from the others and was just too perfect. i'm really going to miss waiting for the new wheel of time book, oh well I'm glad it went out with glory.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I cannot say enough good about this game. The concept is simple but engaging, the controls are excellent, and the graphics are clean and appealing. Most of all, it is so addictive! My wife and I have very different tastes in games, but we both love this one!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|great reading as only tom clancy can do!  exciting to reread many of the chapters to see what you missed initially!
B000002OX7|5.0|I think everything that has already been said pretty much sums this gem of an album up. The bonus tracks are fantastic and certainly not throwaways. There will never be a 'Wont get fooled again' track for many a millenium.
B004GYY714|5.0|can listen while perusing or when checking out e-mail or FB, great app, every body should get it and listen!
B005DMNS4A|5.0|One of the finest rock albums ever. Love every song from start to finish. Even if you barely like the Who, buy this album. Chock full of great and memorable songs. Rock on Tommy.
B00BGI08GG|5.0|This show is really bad ace. His acting is kinda off but I think that's how he portrays oliver queen. He was a bad guy in vampire diaries and was different in that role entirely it took me a while to realize that was the same actor. Great series I want the blue ray now!
0547848412|5.0|Very powerful story.<br />Purchased the book after seeing the film and I'm very glad that I have now gotten both tellings of the story.
B0072OFOM6|4.0|awesome purchase, would not have bought it for full price at first but i got a deal on and now that i know how great the content is I might think twice.<br />most recommended, very entertaining
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I like this film, though I can't help thinking it would have been better if it had been made by someone else.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game reminds me of chess in that you have to think ahead of your moves in order to decide how to move the raindrop in catching all the pearls in the fewest moves possible.  It is a great brain exercise.
B009G5TWFO|5.0|The movie was action packed and emotion filled. The picture quality wasn't that great. Hopefully amazon will work on the picture.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I installed the free version of this game and went through the 7 sections really enjoying it, until you find out to go any further you have to buy the full version.  Well, that ticked me off, especially at $4.99 for the full version.  That is way too much for an app game.  So I waited until it went half price, then I thought that's still too much, so when it went on sale for .99 cents I bought it.  I love playing this game with all the different levels of history from the ancient world.
0345803507|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Awesome I can read this over and over again. This book is a must read. The entire series is a must read
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This game is similar to the &#34;Call of Atlantis&#34; game.  So far I've only played for several days and haven't gotten very far, not knowing how involved the game goes in depth.  It is fun to play and see if you can secure the object of the day before time runs out,
B00818J504|5.0|Amazing memoir worth a 2nd read. Insightful, provoking, and funny. Love her perspective and outlook on life. &#34;Party hard. Work 10x's harder.
B003G4W49C|5.0|It can be hard to tell the direction a story will take before you read it. I was concerned I wouldn't be able to relate to the main character in this book since I am not a kid. That wasn't an issue as Ender isn't your average kid, so I say jump in and enjoy if this is your concern too.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What can i say, i love these books! Not better than the first book, but definately a must read, exorbitant after the first and second ones. Can't wait for the next book...hopefully
B000QRIGLC|5.0|A great read for all who would champion the human spirit to excel to the highest standards of physical and mental fitness, to persevere at all costs, to fight honorably and live a life of focused determination.  You have made your brothers proud!  Well Done Marcus! 1 Corinthians 9:26-27
B0041KVZ0Y|5.0|This review is about the 2012 Vinyl remaster. My mother had the original vinyl when it came out. I listened to this growing up and 20 years ago I got the cd. I read the painstaking process that was taken in these 2012 remasters so I go this one first. I have a simple system, a 100 watt Pioneer receiver with 2 tower speakers that can push 120 watts. The sound simply blows you away. You really don't appreciate  how good an album can sound until you hear it in pure form. In my opinion this is the starting direction in where the Beatles separated themselves form Pop stars to studio musicians. Take the track \\"think for yourself\\" Paul's distorted Bass track really pops out and literally ran chills up my spine. The only thing I have to say is if you are hesitating about purchasing this, don't. When these sell out, we will see these on ebay selling for 200.00 a pop. True Classics.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Awesome game  VERY VERY addicting I am not sure I will be able to put it down and go to sleep.  I wish it had many more lives
B00BESJYAY|5.0|I'm no surfer but I can aprisiate the effort and commitment it must take to get good at it. You would have to be crazy to get take on these waves. People are capable of incredible things when they they have the will to do so. This true story provesthat.
B000K7VHJQ|3.0|I have this version and to tell you the truth have only watched once or twice since this version came out cause it is just way too violent even for a re-cut version. I understand it has to be realistic but Jesus whipping goes on what feels like for days. For a believer, it really does make you feel the extent of what Jesus went through in front of the Jews. If you don't mind the gore, then you will enjoy it. However, I kind of think I didn't need to purchase this movie a long time ago. Great to watch around Easter.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was the first book I read by Colleen Hoover.  I was immediately immersed in the story and devoured the pages. It was a fantastic book! I have since read two more books by this author, Slammed and Point of Retreat. They too are fabulous!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Just started playing this game today. I can already say its great. I just wish you could get extra live accumulated faster.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Although it was a bit dark at times. I really enjoyed this book. It was a suspenseful page turner and overall a very fun read.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|My children did a Phantom of the Opera halftime theme this past football season. Their band director had them watch the movie and my oldest loved it so much, she ask for it for Christmas. I'm sure she will watch it over & over.
B005LAIHYU|2.0|Okay.<br />I'm not sure how to approach this, other than to say way too much of the dour Abe and not enough of the tooth-full vampires.  Throughout, I kept thinking......is this hysterically correct?<br />The difficulty with period pieces is the obligation to the period in question.  Saddled with trying to custom-fit Abe into the vampire genre is problematic to say the least.  It all comes down to whether or not you can accept the ludicrous premise of a president axing no questions and telling great lies for the good of the nation........wait a minute, which president are we talking about again?<br /><br />Vampires and Abe, Abe and vampires, nope, I just don't get it and never will.  I'm a huge fan of vampire flicks but this one defies all logic and good sense (not to mention physics).  Part harlequin romance, part ninja warriors on a mission, this movie starts then stalls, progressing awkwardly/slowly between the dullness of the history and the fits and spurts when the vampires are momentarily dealt with.  The camera work is the best part of this movie.  And yes, the horse stampede was easily the best scene.<br />And!  Best lesson learned from this movie......vampires can't kill their own.  But that doesn't stop them from beating the crap out of each other to the point of......................
B004NJDJYS|4.0|Unusual book that makes you think about nature or nuture issue. Really makes you think about the family of the school shooters like never before.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|It took me a while to get to it and I'm glad I did.  It was an unusual fantasy.  I liked it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is awesome! Really recommend buying. It's addicting. I can't stop playing. This is what I look forward to at the end of the day. Again REALLY recommend buying!
B0094POVZM|4.0|This movie is a real world movie regarding inequalities,judgements,reactions,etc. that we all make. However, there are always consequences for all of our actions. Unforturnately, we all are too quick to judge these days. This movie is a good reminder though that we all are more alike than we are different. We feel,need,love,want acceptance,etc.this movie glimpses these emotions. I enjoyed it very much.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I bought this CD after hearing just a few of the hits from it. I listened to it from beginning to end, there is not one song on it that I would 'delete'. Her voice is amazing and the lyrics can touch your soul.
B00AMS4YVQ|4.0|Continuing to hustle and with awesome production (do people still say awesome) T.I. does it again. The beats are undeniable and the diversity of his life comes through the music on this album.
B002KSPKRS|3.0|didn't really care for the wireless headset.  I like the wired headsets a lot better because you can hear better and you don't have to keep replacing batteries
B00BWJARHO|3.0|This prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy was waaay too long!  Apparently we are going to be treated to a three-part narrative.  It is a visual treat but takes forever to get anywhere.
B00631VJIC|5.0|I would tell everyone to buy this cd because this show is the best bad ass show on tv plus jax.
B004QIG7CW|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and music but just as entertaining is their characters development.  It has a lot going for it the sense that there young people can find and make right choices despite the conditions their are living in.  We all don't live in rose covered houses that even offer love but just a place to hang one's hat for a short time.  Good for the producers, directors etc., it helps one to see you can rise above adversity and succeed.
B005OK725M|5.0|Okay, there are certain movies that are short on fundamentals but high on action and entertainment.  I call those my Guilty Pleasure Action Flicks (GPAF).  When I want to put my overworked, exhausted brain in neutral, I slip a GPAF in the player.  I own a bunch of them, but some of my favorites are Battleship, The Fifth Element, Desperado, High Plains Drifter, The Losers, The Quick and the Dead, Spartan, and Wanted.  Columbiana just joined that list of GPAFs.  Zoe Saldana as Cataleya is sexy, intense, calculating, cold-blooded but occasionally vulnerable.  All plot holes aside, what's not to love?  Great flick when you just want to shift your brain out of gear, coast downhill, and enjoy the ride.
0062238868|5.0|I liked the book so  much that I sent it to my father-in-law in Salem, Oregon to read.<br /><br />I wanted to read it again so I bought another copy.<br /><br />I love shooting accurate rifles and pop lots of prairie dogs with my .220 Swift at ranges up to 500 yards.  Chris Kyle takes you through his experiences with kills over a mile.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|The only difference between this one and that are the colors, and that you have to use all the boxes instead of trying to beat the ooze through the pipes..
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I have just gotten this game and it was one of my best buys for my kindle. I would recommend anyone who likes RTS games to get it. It takes a little while to learn how to finish some of the quest. I personally think that this is one of the best free games for android devices.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I love this movie.  What I particularly like is that it is not all sweetness and light in the hallowed hall of heroes.  There is contention, there are egos, there are fights!  These are humans (well most of them) and they have to work at getting along.  And you can tell the battle isn't over yet - neither internally or externally, but it's going to be a great story!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great book!  Even  though it was from a high school freshman's poimt of view, there are great lessons for us all.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I'm usually happy if a movie does a &#34;passable&#34; job of presenting its book.  I'm thrilled if it does as good a job as the book.  I'm amazed that, for the first time, I think the movie is actually better than the book.  I think it's better because it incorporates some of the additional material Tolkien wrote about Middle Earth in a seamless and interesting way.  I'm still getting used to the greater Torin plays, but I think it is a good thing.  And Bilbo is just perfect!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Hours of entertainment.  Ads are a little annoying but easy to ignore. Plenty of game choices.  I would recommend it.
B000002KGT|5.0|Awesome blast from the past ! remember going to this concert way back when and it was good music then and still is !
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|I'm glad I bought this one while it was 99¢, because I would not have paid full price for this.  The story is okay, but somewhat cliche at times with the kidnapping of the president and stuff like that.  The fact that you get to play as the bad guy was pretty cool, though seemed &#34;wrong&#34; at times, especially when you infiltrate an American defense post and kill american troops.  The biggest problem I had was the over use of foul language, dropped the &#34;f&#34; word way too much.  Overall, just okay.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Jodi Picoult is an amazing storyteller and captured my attention from the very beginning. I had a hard time putting the book down. I tried to guess how the story would end and she kept me guessing up to the last page. I love this author and am looking forward to reading more of her books.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|AWSOME app defenetly get it its AMAZING when I wake up to go ultimo school I love it its much better than BEEP BEEP from a regular alarm clock and its free get it.
B000ID37SQ|5.0|One of the best films made in the history of films.  Now I'm writing this shpiel so that I can give it the 5 stars it deserves!
B003U51D58|5.0|Everytime I watch, I catch something I missed. Between my busy toddler & my talk to much during the episode husband, it's easy to miss an intricate detail; like the fact Kate can't leave Aaron with Claire's mother because she is already \\"in a coma\\", I may be late but I live this show.
0307277887|3.0|I am not a TV person because I generally derive more from books than from movies or shows. But in this particular instance, I'll have to say that the Showtime production &#34;Dexter&#34; (first season) is actually better than &#34;Darkly Dreaming Dexter&#34;.<br /><br />Dexter is a forensics tech for the Miami police department. He is also a psychopathic killer raised by the Code of Harry in order that he keep his sociopathic tendencies in check. His relationship with his sister Deborah is about as close to love, or any emotion for that matter, as he will ever feel for any human being. That's about where the similarities between book and cable series ends.<br /><br />I did indeed buy the 2nd and 3rd books of the Dexter series, hoping for more in-depth development of character. The Showtime production actually did a better job in that respect; the book was lacking.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am very happy with this app on my Kindle Fire and on my android phone. Never gives me any problems.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I like it becuase there are lots of pages to write on amd you put attachment and make new books in just a minute or less. But, however, I'd like to have some help with my books. I deleted a book. Is there any way to get it back,or is it gone forever? Thank-You for your help!
B003WUYRGI|5.0|THIS WAS GOOD<br /><br />OH MY GOD MY BUTTCHEEK IS A GREAT WAY OF BIRTH CONTROL PILLS ARE THE PUBLIC DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION CODES FOR YOU AND YOUR BIRTH CONTROL PILLS THEN YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS IS NOT ALLOWED TO BE ABLE TO GET IT DONE BY THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE FIRST PLACE FOR A LOT OF BIRTH CONTROL PILLS ARE NOT ALLOWED THE MOST POPULAR STORIES ABOUT THIS PAGE IS NOT ALLOWED CONTACT US MILITARY SERVICE AND I WAS REALLY RETARDED BACK THEN YOU CAN ALSO FIND THAT SANDWICH WITH PICKLES TO GET THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF BIRTH CONTROL OVER YOUR FAMILY IS NOT ALLOWED CONTACT THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT ALLOWED TO GET IT DONE WITH PICKLES AND THE SANDWICH YOU FOUND EARLIER TODAY AND I THINK THAT THIS PAGE IS NOT THE FIRST PLACE FOR THE PUBLIC AND A SANDWICH YOU WILL ENJOY
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love Harry.  Michael Connelly continues to intrigue me with Harry's character and the situation he finds himself in.  I know when I start reading I won't be able to put it down and it was true for this one also.  I love reading about Harry.  And having his daughter as part of his life rounds out his character a lot more.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|It's really addicting and fun and it doesn't take much space but I wish the battles were more realistic because you just put units in spaces and hit start and watch
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|We watched the first season on Netflix and then we HAD to watch the second season before we could watch the current season on PBS!!!  It is so moving and so interesting to see how the family deals with change and Maggie Smith is terrific.  She has some lines that are zingers!!! We love the all and feel like we know them!
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|This is a fun puzzle/matching game for the kindle fire. However, just as soon as you enjoy it and start playing, you run out of lives and you can't play anymore. I don't want to have to wait 8 minutes between rounds or to be forced to connect to Facebook. I just want to play...so annoyed!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I watched the first episode of season one and immediaetly purchased season one and two. I'm hooked and will be adding season three soon.
B00005LK94|5.0|What a wonderful video for adults, adolescents, and younger children, too.  Magnificent photography of scenery and geese in formation soaring the landscape cause the soul itself to soar.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Best calculator app ever It features easy to touch BIG buttons. Not only is it a great app, It's free!!!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I love this game shooting birds at pigs trying to get their territory back is great even my 6 yr old cousin loved it
B00377E5R2|5.0|What a wonderful story without sex and violence, hard to find in this day and age and Harrison Ford as usual is great in this film
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Loved it and watched it over and over. I hope they do a part 2. And keep all thw same actors.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|This app really work's good<br />You should download this app.You get to control your computer. But you have to download splashtop streamer on your computer.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|If I could give this 1000 stars I would. The second I heard this album I fell in love with it. \\" Welcome to my world/Step right through the door/I'll penetrate your soul/You'll want to lose control...\\" How can you turn down this invitation given to you? I read a complaint about how they have lost their European form with a more bluesy sound. I still do hear gorgeous Chopin, Schubert style melodies /harmonies. It is very rare to hear a direct continuation of European tradition combined with raw blue notes in the same song. A perfect example of this is \\"Slow.\\" Wow. What genius. I honestly think that Martin Gore is not only up there with Lennon, McCartney, but also with Brahms,  Beethoven etc... As for David's voice, it is more soulful than ever, and the songs are even better because of him. The album itself is a masterpiece and it seems to follow the same rhythmical template. There is no anthem that sticks out, perhaps because the ENTIRE album is superb.  No songs seem to be misplaced here either ( e.g. Peace from SOTU). I prefer an excellent consistent recording to say only 5 good songs and 5 that are so so.  I have followed Depeche Mode since 1987 and this is up there with MFTM, V, SOFAD, The deluxe edition is worth it.  You can tell this album was planned out thoughtfully before it was executed. It might be missing the atmosphere of Wilder, but it is so tempting to listen to. In this album I hear maturity, darkness, seduction, rawness, sophistication and perfection all in one. Bravo. Well done.
B00006AG5N|4.0|Was packaged very well, love the music, It played well in my stereo and I am very happy with this cd.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good graphics, nice to have puzzles and not just a seek and find.  Looking forward to other games along the same lines.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|very fun and friendlybfor kids.you get to play with pets and wash themband you get to move up levels.<br />very very firendly.
1451629192|3.0|This was really hard to listen to. I am deathly afraid that something will happen to one of my kids, and this did nothing to assuage my fears.    Throughout the book, my one overriding, eloquent thought was \\"holy s***.\\"    Initially, I couldn't believe that Dugard was narrating the audiobook version; it must have been painful enough to write it all down. But really, who else could have done it justice? A professional voice artist wouldn't have captured her \\"voice,\\" nor would she have been able to evoke the same sense of horror.    I can't even begin to imagine how terrifying Dugard's life was. It scares the ever-loving daylights out of me to think of my children in her situation. Excuse me while I hide them away from the rest of the world.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love this game! I used to play Mario when I was little and this game is very similar to it!! Great game!
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Easy on the ears not to overpowering good songs and awesome bonus tracks.When it comes to music the man knows what he's doing.Thanks...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very easy to play. It's heart racing especially when you are trying to run from the monster thing and he eats you!  The sound affects on this game are awesome. This game is a must have if you really want some safari fun!!!!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I absolutely could not put this down. It is very well written, and the characters are great. There is a moment in this book, which will be different for everyone, when the cleverness of the way it was written hits you like a ton of bricks!  I have read tons of thrillers, but this one still managed to give me the willies. Going to check out her other books!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Very very very fun game I recommend this for anyone who likes sim city<br />But also it is free free! I mean can't get much better than that.
B004SRNH10|4.0|Was free and needed for one of the applications that I needed.  Don't really know what else it does. But hey the price was right.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|The hints are great. They make it fun. This game is easy to understand. You,however,need a pencil and paper to write down the combination in the chest in the manager's office.

B002ZG97EC|5.0|I have bought multiple copies of this movie--grandkids in several states and of course one for me and the 20-somethings that live with me. It is a wonderful movie with redeeming values. Would recommend.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|This movie scared the hell out of me from the very beginning.  Then the possibility of this really happening terrified me<br />even more.  It was sad, but something everyone should see for many reasons.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I like the size and weight of this sharpener and yet it still works great. I've thrown this in a pouch on my BK9 combat bowie's sheath along with a firesteel and the added weight is nothing. This way I have a sharpener with my knife at all times. I love the steel rod for sharpening serations that a bonus over many small sharpeners.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Michall Connelly, you never cease to amaze me. I was telling people all about this book, I usually just finish and on to the next. This one got talked about  ALOT. Loved it!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great story, my first Kindle ebook read. Chris is an excellent story teller. Appreciate his bringing the wife in for her side of some situations.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I feel in love with this series after my daughter kept telling me about it.  My husband and I watch Season 1 in its entirety in one 24 hour period on Netflix.  However, Netflix didn't have Season 2.  So we bought single episodes of Season 2 from Amazon.com.  I still go  back and watch episodes that we watched in the past.  Entertaining!
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game is so much fun. great for a rainy day. the one thing I dont care too much for is how hard it is to get more diamonds after you have used the initial amount.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I only just started it a few minutes ago, so far it is a fun game. I need to get the feel for it in order to give a better opinion.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are great for a younger and older audience. I don't know if I like them quite as much as Harry Potter, but definitely WAY better than Twilight.  I could hardly put them down and finished them quite quickly. There is also a movie series being made based on these (the first one has already been released).  The first movie was quite good.  I can't decide which book out of the series is my favorite.  I'll have to give them a re-read and decide then.  Also, my brother, who hasn't been known to be a reader, especially of series books like these, also liked these books a lot.
0792839749|5.0|A classic movie for the young ones.  Great story for the kids [and others].  As originally shown with no changes seen.
B000007638|2.0|It isn't even a GOOD recording in mono. Listened to it on 2 CD plsyers, the TV's player, a Sony Walkman, and the computer. Believe me, it's in mono!<br /><br />Go to YouTube abd play Paul McCartney & Wings = Venus and Mars - Rock Show - Jet, and you'll see what I mean. Even a YouTube upload is better.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|I loved what they did with the characters in the movie and how their super powers were treated. I thought the way they incorporated Xavier being unable to walk and how Magneto got his helmet were very enjoyable to watch. I didn't think the main villain had too much to contribute to the movie, but he served his purpose.<br /><br />The action was great, the effects were awesome, but really the characterization was top notch.  Very fun movie.
B008NR8YXC|5.0|Talk about monumental! I was totally blown away by the command, clarity , creativity, and mastery displayed in the Well Tempered Clavier by Andras Schiff. I own  a previous version of Schiff's WTC along with interpretations by Richter, Hewitt, Tureck, and, of course, Gould, all of which I've listened to religiously, and I think Schiff's new rendition just may be the most pleasant of the bunch, and the one I seem reach for most, when I need my Bach fix. Given that it's much newer than other recordings of the 48, the sound engineering is leaps and bounds ahead of others in the pack. You won't regret owning this timeless treasure!
B005ZO6NRA|1.0|Wow, this movie was a huge disappointment and I'm glad I saw it for free. Let's start off with the main issues this movie had.<br /><br />1.) Editing was just awful, supposedly there's this huge world that Conan is supposed to travel, yet he seems to arrive at each location in a manner of seconds.<br /><br />2.) Conan was very one dimensional. Sure he was shown as being a bit more creative in fighting his opponents and made him into more of a rogue, cheater, stealthy guy. But his motives and personality were very one note and not interesting at all.<br /><br />3.) Let's talk about the editing again, IT SUCKED! It made the action sequences very boring and generic.<br /><br />4.) The acting was pretty bad, Conan's voice cracked a few times from trying to sound deeper than it normally was. There's nothing to write home about with one exception, I did enjoy watching the villain.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The first great thing about this series is that you can download the first book (Wool) for free. I read great reviews about it and decided that I would read the first part and buy the rest if I enjoyed it. I read the first one in about three hours and bought the rest the same day. I am only about half way through the omnibus but I love it so far. It is a great, suspenseful, unique story that is very hard to put down. I would recommend it to lovers of science fiction, mystery, and suspense genres.
B004OZZ624|4.0|I love Russell Crowe so I always enjoy watching him as I think he is a very talented actor. The movie was suspenseful, and we really enjoyed watching it. So I recommend it. Women, you will all wish you had a husband like him!
B00B9LNJ9I|3.0|After listening \\"Safe trip home\\" (2008) I thought that eventhough it was a good record with a more organic sound that Dido had worked with for it, that record itself was kind of lost trying to follow a path that was never found. Now, back to 2013 with \\"Girl who got away\\" I see this main issue with the album refered to \\"deepness and emotion\\". It seems to me that Dido tried to go back to a more pop sound that she has always been used to but, in the process she lost that magic.<br /><br />\\"No freedom\\" was not exactly the single I was hoping for when it was released but, I liked it hoping that the album had something more outstanding. Unfortunely, there is no such thing in this record. There are songs that try to make a point in its sound and lyrics and they do actually but, there are others that just get lost. \\"Sitting on the roof of the world\\", \\"End of night\\", \\"Let us move on...\\" and of course \\"No freedom\\" accomplish its purpose in the album for them to be there but, as far as the rest of the songs is concerned, they only show Dido's talent in its surface without really going deeper.<br /><br />Dido has always been a singer I DO believe is capable of making great songs when she's really into it but, this record feels like it was rushed by the business men more than by Dido. I really hope that she returns for the next album as her full capacity because that's how \\"Life for rent\\" (2003) felt back then:)
B000EZ7ZXQ|5.0|One of the best films from Sandler. Good date movie for any season or occasion. Humor hits wen it has to.
B00B9LNLTQ|5.0|\\"Comedown machine\\" can be describe with only one word: FUN! The Strokes made a bet for an upbeat record with songs that you can even dance (nope! I'm not kidding here) and I believe they won taking all the stack home.<br /><br />Oh, God! where to start? \\"All the time\\" and \\"50/50\\" must be the rock songs in this record and believe me, when you listen th second one there will be a \\"Sex pistols\\" thing going on there. \\"One way trigger\\" is so special. It made me laught out loud and at the same time I loved it. Call me crazy but I feel that this song has a \\"Take on me (A-ha)\\" vibe going on. \\"Tap out\\" and \\"Welcome to Japan\\" must be my other favorites in the record. Casablancas is so in love with this vintage sound that goes between the late 70's and mid 80's and with this couple of songs there's no doubt about it. \\"80's comedown machine\\" sounds like an underground band playing in a club of outsiders back in 1984 or 1985 trying to be so different from all the \\"sell out music\\" that was on the radio back then. It's an experiment really just as it was \\"Ask me anything\\" from \\"First impressions of earth\\" (2006). I love both. \\"Happy ending\\" and \\"Chances\\" are other cool songs that I know I'll keep on playing over and over again for the simple reason that they show where the band is right now and why the have so much fun in there.<br /><br />\\"Comedown machine\\" and \\"Angles\\" (2011) could've been a double album because they kind of go on the same path but CM walks faster without being attached to anything. Now, if you are expecting another \\"Is this it?\\" (2001) album with the rawness of it, you better look somewhere else cause The Strokes has nothing to show you here and, if I were you (yes! I'm talking to you \\"Is this it?\\" lovers) I would get over that record because I don't think that The Strokes have the intention to repeat themselves that way ever again. By the way, I loved the album cover... RCA??? hahahaha so 70's

B00785P2QC|5.0|Good game,could be sorted out with the price of every object.takes way to long to get into though.all in all it is a brilliant game.
0525953728|4.0|Actual rating: 3.5 stars.<br /><br />I'm not going to take a lot of time on this book. Overall, it was good. Not great.<br /><br />The writing is relatively simple. The good side of that is ease of understanding; he explains things in such a way that even non-military folks can understand it. It wasn't beautiful prose--just nice and easy. That's fine.<br /><br />I liked that he included some of the fringe contributors (example: female CIA Analyst) and their role and reaction to UBL's demise.<br /><br />I thought that the author was a little unprofessional in his handling of a few things. It lowered my opinion of him a notch. I still appreciate what he did, of course.  But it marred the story unnecessarily.<br /><br />If you'd like to get a small peek at what it's like to be a SEAL, and also get some insight into the Bin Laden raid, it's a good read.

B006MMX1GU|5.0|There are no words to describe this aural extravaganza from Eric Burden one time all star line - up. There are no losers here,just time lost between the original release and now.The mix,digital and warm , retaining the 1/4 inch reel it was recorded on. Unlike other reviews I have read , the real deal is Gemini/The Madman which embraces the Psychedelia of the moment (the 60's edge) and gives you the ultimate reaming of west meets East culture.The uninitiated will find that cut a little hard to swallow,so there's another more commercial blend for you who might doubt the strength of this combo, Ring of Fire/Coloured Rain  . Innovative guitar work for the time, facing off Frank Zappa and Jerry Garcia with more harmonic creativity  and note-4-note value Punctuating the signature sound of this short-lived Animal Pack.Eric is just over-the-top here ,if you are an Eric Burdon fan, the man flexes his vocal muscle to the max.It's his baby,baby,-what kept this gem hiding for so long,is still a mystery to me. I've been waiting to get my second chance with \\"LOVE IS...\\" for at least thirty years. Add an extra star if you've dropped **** and listened to this in the height of your youth. I have no regrets. KNA Amazon .com,you're the greatest.( oh yeah,and I have met Tina Turner LOL)Hope you mates are still groovin' Together in retrospect.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I have built every computer I have ever owned. This CPU cooler made a 25% difference in thermal measurement. I bought a brand new Sabertooth (990), and AMD quad-core, and the NZXT case I had simply did not have the air-flow design for a CPU of this magnitude (thermally speaking). I purchased the biggest bang for the buck that I could find (Cougar Case), and I still received warnings from the sensors on the ASUS Mobo. After installing this CPU cooler, the temperatures all dropped to well below default warning thresholds, and remained there, even during periods of heavy load on CPU/RAM/Network. The only negative I can think to offer is that the copper peaks are just ever so excessively tall. I can still close the case, but the intake 120mm fan is a bit compressed. This, however, is not enough to interfere with the fan operation, nor is it enough to deduct a star. Well done, Cooler Master.
B0067R0APK|1.0|While I did get a 25 day forecast I lost a lot more that was important to me. I lost color so now instead of seeing a bright yellow Sun with a cloud showing with it I see a black and white icon which is a circle with a little lines running through it and I'm supposed to see that clear enough at a glance to know that that means sun with some clouds. I wear glasses much harder to deal with if I have to get them out particularly when I'm in the car.<br /><br />another issue for me is the fact the sunset time no longer shows on the top screen. I have to do 2 more clicks to get to it. This is significant to me when I'm driving and again may not have on reading glasses to look for extra places to click. I have to be back before dark so always checking sunset while driving. (Sunrise not so important as can take time to get to that)<br /><br />I travel a lot in a high vehicle which is sensitive to wind direction and force.it is much easier for me and many other to realize the wind directions and the changes with the use of the visual directional indicator which is also now missing from the top screen.<br /><br />my other concern is the fact that I now have to reenter 27 locations from the places I frequently travel to. You would think if 1 were paying for an upgrade app there would be a way to transfer my locations.<br /><br />so I hope the developers take some of these things into consideration. I for 1 am just really angry that I paid for so much less functionality. I will be going back to the old application and immediately un installing something I PAID for 20 minutes ago.
B002EMESSM|1.0|This happens occasionally with Amazon Video. It will not stream properly. When that happens I can always watch another movie from Amazon or Netflix, just not the one I want to watch at the moment, which proves it is not a problem on my end.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved this story. There were many unexpected twists and turns. Story kept me engaged. I would recommend this book to all.
B008518MOW|5.0|As with other movie purchases, I loved MIB and MIB II.  Not only do I think its the best MIB yet, but it was great in 3-D.
B00C2IPB9S|5.0|In \\"Batman Begins,\\" Christopher Nolan managed to do what few directors could do -- create a dark, gritty atmosphere around an all-too-human Batman, who fights for the oppressed with quiet intensity.<br /><br />That moody murk is only intensified in the breathtaking, harrowing \\"Dark Knight,\\" which fills itself with blasts of action, psychological twists and a shocking tragedy. Nolan pulls no punches for our dark knight or his ever-endangered Gotham City, but brilliant acting of the hero and villains is what truly elevates the second of Nolan's Batman movies to a work of cinematic art.<br /><br />Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) is continuing to fight the good fight for Gotham, even when he gets hurt in a fight against Scarecrow and some Batman impersonators.<br /><br />So unsurprisingly, he's is feeling fairly in his crimefighting abilities, especially since the new DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is a morally-upright good-guy. But Batman isn't prepared for the Joker (Heath Ledger) a mad clownish psychopath who has hired himself out to the mob to destroy their worst enemy, the Dark Knight. He starts blackmailing Batman by killing Gotham citizens, and saying he won't stop until Batman turns himself in.<br /><br />But even when captured, the Joker has an ace up his sleep -- Dent and Rachel Dawes' (Maggie Gyllenhaal) lives. And after a devastating loss, Batman finds himself dealing with the Joker taking all of Gotham hostage, and the maddened and disfigured Dent bringing vigilante justice to all those whom he thinks have wronged him. Only Batman has a chance of stopping even one of them -- let alone both -- but doing so may tarnish the Dark Knight forever.<br /><br />Most directors would have given this movie a distinctly comic-book, slick pop-culture feel. But no matter how hard you search, there's not a single hint in \\"The Dark Knight\\" that anything kitschy or campy came before it, or that it was originally a comic book. Instead Christopher Nolan creates a movie as dark, tightly-wound and intense as Batman himself.<br /><br />And Nolan's skills are even more polished this time around -- lots of kinetic action, vicious dogs and car chases, including the rather silly-looking Batpod and the tanklike Batmobile. The dialogue is drizzled with dry humor (\\"That isn't exactly what I had in mind when I said I wanted to inspire people\\",\\" Batman says, looking at a bunch of impersonators), mostly to temper the overhanging sense of horror and apprehension.<br /><br />This is especially true whenever the Joker's corrosive presence is onscreen, since he's all too happy to stick pointy objects in people -- he's creepier than a thousand boogeymen. And Nolan is not afraid to further darken the storyline by inflicting yet another personal tragedy on Batman. His direction is painfully delicate as he explores Wayne's sorrow and guilt.<br /><br />But the most striking aspect of \\"The Dark Knight\\" is Nolan's delvings into morality -- The Joker has none and Dent's becomes horribly perverted, but we're reminded that there are some who will not be corrupted even if they lose what is most precious. It's almost a doom'n'gloom movie, but the faint hints of optimism and hope keep it from being TOO overwhelmingly dark.<br /><br />Christian Bale is simply perfection as Bruce Wayne/Batman, using his handsomely chiseled face and piercing eyes to best advantage -- even in the most tragic scenes, where you can practically see Wayne's soul bleeding. And he has a difficult character to wrangle with -- not only does he have to expose Batman's pain and struggles, but also his inner incorruptibility.<br /><br />On the flipside, the late Heath Ledger is blindingly brilliant as the sadistic, creepy, gleefully malign Joker, and he chews the scenery as few actors could. He's pretty spine-chilling, actually -- the Joker is a true \\"agent of chaos,\\" whose intent is to seize Gotham, and corrupt Batman's soul along the way. There's also a solid (and underrated) supporting cast-- Eckhart is outstanding as an upstanding DA whose morality becomes horribly perverted (along with his handsome face), Gyllenhaal has a solid role that she plays well, and Michael Caine is a quiet, steady flame as the ever-faithful, dryly sardonic Alfred.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" is suffused with darkness and some truly ghastly villains, but the magnificent acting and dryly witty script are what really make this a masterpiece. Utterly astounding -- and promises better yet to come.-- Eckhart is outstanding as an upstanding DA whose morality becomes horribly perverted (along with his handsome face), Gyllenhaal has a solid role that she plays well, and Michael Caine is a quiet, steady flame as the ever-faithful, dryly sardonic Alfred.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" is suffused with darkness and some truly ghastly villains, but the magnificent acting and dryly witty script are what really make this a masterpiece.

B008XBCJ34|5.0|Loved it.  I thought the movie as a creation was unbelievably good, but in 3-D it just took my breath away.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I really do like pinterest. The only thing that kept me from rating it 5 stars is, that when you first open it and I see my page with my pins, the pins are all over the place (because it puts the pins in the order I pined them). I would like to see some order in my pins (for example first all the food, then all the crafts, etc.)<br /><br />Other then that, I love it.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|Loved the movie very much when it was first released and even more so when I viewed it  in 3-D.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|best album ever pretty much sums it up,and the price was right for a digital downloadi will keep it on my phone forever
B005LAJ16I|5.0|It was compelling, the characters were well drawn and the acting was great.  It kept me on the edge of my seat.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|this is way better than the first game. it has better graphics better animations and more playable charecters. its worth it!
B0083P1QUM|3.0|It was interesting but I was able to put it down and not rush back.  It took me over two weeks to finish it and I usually go through a book in a couple of days.
B000FA5STS|5.0|Within the realm of possibility, the plot is dynamic and intense.  Highly recommend for mystery and thriller fans. A fabulous and exciting read.
B002VECLVY|3.0|I really enjoyed the movie... in fact, I cried at the end.... but be aware that this is a Hollywoodized version of a much more complex and interesting novel. It's agitprop for gay rights, a cause I strongly support. Still, being on the right side doest not a great movie make. Just one example; in the movie, George is refused an invitation to his lover's funeral. In the book, the lover's family invites him , but George refuses to go. A major theme of the book is that people subject to discrimination are NOT always nice. The Book's George is supremely creepy at various points. You wouldn't know that, from the movie. The book's dumpy little beach house and fading hippy friends turn into sophisticates in Dwell Magazine houses. Don't get me wrong, I love Dwell Magazine houses, but the world and people sketched in this movie have nothing to do with the book. The book is art. This movie is a very well made, well-acted , and enjoyable distortion.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Excellent Classic Connelly stuff. Necessary to fill out the life and times of Harry Bosch. I cant wait for the next episode.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Justin sounds awesome! NICE MIX OF MUSIC STYLES!! Every Moody Blues fan or Justin Hayward fan should pick this up!
B00BL5EQLC|4.0|I usually do one of two things with free apps of the day. Either get them, try for a level, then uninstall. Or try for a few levels and decide if its worth keeping. I figure its free, ill purchase it and maybe ill play it someday. I do have a limited amount of space for games so I have to be picky on what I keep around. This one may stick around for a while.<br />Yes it is a runner style game but the quirky look makes it different. No there aren't instructions but when you encounter the need for a new move it freezes for a second with a quick blurb on the motion it requires. Its not difficult to follow at all. Graphics are smooth. Character doesn't have to be extremely precise amount movement leaving minimal room for error or slower response time. I'm sure as I progress the levels may get frustrating but I don't feel that will happen too fast. Each level is relatively short as to not make any one level feel like if I start over its too hard to reach the end. Definitely good entertainment for a quick level in betwen things I need to do in the real world.
1439153663|5.0|This was a &#34;I can't put down&#34; book! Beautifully written, takes you along with the people and times. Looking forward to more from this author.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The repetition is annoying and some of the British-isms clearly don't fit the thought process of a 22 year old American woman. Otherwise the book evokes emotion. I laughed, cringed, gasped, angered and cried.
0451208706|5.0|Great story. Grabs attention from the first page and hangs on. Descriptive writing excellent as usual. If one cannot travel, read Follet and you won't be disappointed. History as it should be explained to the  interested.

I'm very glad that everybody else in the world can now appreciate the work of a genius I've long held in high esteem.<br /><br />The movie is, as the title suggests, fantastic. From start to finish I was constantly in awe. It's one of a small selection of films I suggest buying because of the great rewatchability. Get it!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I may not have been quite with it at first-it seemed to take a while to get the consept.  But I am thoroughly enjoying the next novel in the series.  Love science fiction.  When i was just a little girl, I really expected to travel to the moon with my father.
0545265355|5.0|I actually watched the movie before reading the books. A friend told me the first book was (unsurprisingly) much better and after falling in love with the movie, I decided to pick up the books. It was one of the best purchases I have ever made.<br /><br />Katniss is, without a shadow of a doubt, the easiest character I've ever become emotionally invested in. When she felt pain, I felt it. When she felt angst, I felt it. Her triumphs felt like my triumphs and her tragedies left me in tears.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book series enough. You owe it to yourself to experience it.

B00BMVTTJ4|4.0|I'm giving this 4 stars based on 2 things.<br /><br />First the movie itself is easily 5 stars. I loved every minute. It's WAY better than the first 1/3 of the book, in my opinion.<br /><br />Second, this is not the extended edition. That means I'll end up repurchasing this down the road when they eventually release the new content. I'm not happy about that at all but it is what it is. I'm only taking away 1 star but I fully understand why people would only give this version 1 star total.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book was easy to pick up and read, I was into it right away. I learned something from it, since I haven't been exposed to children with terminal cancer. It was very sad, yet there were parts that were funny too. A good read for anyone that doesn't mind shedding a tear occasionally in exchange for learning about a struggle that someone else is going through. Compare to your own troubles, and you may feel fortunate.
0765325950|5.0|Brandon Sanderson really took the series in the right direction when he took over for Robert Jordan.

R.I.P. Robert Jordan. Your legacy will live on.

As I grew older, and developed different tastes in the books I chose and having found fewer and fewer sci fi books that interested me, I stopped buying them.  However, I recently purchased the Wool series of books for my Kindle, and have just finished the first book.  This is the best sci fi book that I have read since my youth.  So exciting, so well written, so entertaining...... A must read book, I promise you.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another page turner from Vince Flynn..Mitch Rapp may be my favorite character ever..Every time I finish one of Flynn's books I look forward to the next one.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I have to say this game is like jaws they have 4 now but this game not better than minecraft bu this game is fricken awesome :)
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The concept behind the plot was cleaver, but the focus tends to drift too much to the love story .
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn is a gifted and masterful suspense writer.  I enjoyed every twist and turn in the plot of Gone Girl.
B00BESLT6G|3.0|I found the movie short on plot.  It didn't take long to come to the end of the story.  I did find scarky spots:.  Enough to fkeep my interest!
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|This is a really fun and time consuming game but I don't like the fact that you have to have hundreds of gems to get one pet other than that it is awesome.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|It was so wonderful to be back in Middle Earth again.  Great movie, wonderful world of Hobbits, gnomes, and a talented and loveable wizard.  The wait was worth it.  Keep them coming.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|My hope is we will have a Season 2 and 3 after this lightening bolt of a series on the first voyages of the Vikings from Norway to the English coast.  Yes, it's historic in terms of technology and factual events, but it is far more. The characters are true to Viking lore and culture.  No where before have we seen or understood the 'Shield Maiden' in Viking Culture, nor the role of family and agriculture.  But the battles and violence are also real, and fantastic!
B00BHMF578|5.0|This was a gret movie.  Highly suspenseful with lots of action.  The movie was so good that it seemed over too soon.  Great acting, and lots of drama.  I found mself holding my breath.  You ca't go wrong wit this movie.
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|Have not read much of Ian Rankin but will now look for other books by him. Enjoyed the Scottish characters having been born in Edingurgh.
B008Y6TE5O|4.0|Not a great movie but a very good classic comedy/action movie. Entertaining for the whole family. Watch it and see how many scenes they borrowed from other popular movies of that time.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|Enjoyed the performance of the characters as being true to life at the time of the tale. Production very professional.
B007WPM4P0|3.0|Was more of a love affair and not dealt with a way of life. It was OK OK OK OK
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I thought the story was well thought out and well put together. I could identify with what the characters were feeling and that's always a sign of a good writer.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|A beautiful and inspiring story. I read it and viewed the 3D movie. I could consume more fables such as this!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My daughters are prone to reading series that they love over and over. So putting this on their Kindles was a no brainer. I was able to grab it on the day they ran the special for only 5 dollars for the trilogy. What a bargain!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|A Story about a young writers story about what it is like to be a Help back in the days when color differences was a serious matter. Really like the movie and the dvd was in a very good condition
B000NY12CI|5.0|Wow, it was hard to read this sitting on the beach in Hawaii, thinking how fortunate most of us are, while atrocities are happening to people all over this wonderful world in the name of religion, or craziness of some dictator or another...wait it is alway craziness of people that make it happen. Ayaan's story is of courage, bravery and resourcefulness...I am so happy that she wrote this book, you can tell it is from the heart and true. She has great recollection of detail and emotion all of which are conveyed in this memoir. I would highly recommend this - as one woman's brave story and as a great educational tool to understand the Muslim religion/culture.
B00BL5EQLC|1.0|it's a dum game so don't get it it's dum beacause all you basicly do is jump and duck so there for you shoudn't wast your time just take my werd
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I absolutely love this show. There are so many great story lines that the show is never boring. I can't wait for season 4,
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Engaging drama.  Good acting.  Interesting story line.  We look forward to each episode and are watching all seasons.  Good show.
B0000DCGT0|5.0|The story enfolds with the right people meeting at the right time to bring a rejected horse to championship.  Seabiscuit communicates with his environment....whether in need of horse companionship....or seeing the horse beside him to spur him to win the race.  Wonderful relationship between the rider and the horse.  I will watched this dvd over and over again.  Very inspiring and heartwarming message.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I love history. I found this to be entertaining as well as reasonably informative. Mr. Lincoln was some kind of man. We are lucky to have had him as one of our Presidents.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Quick read on plane. Wished there was one more chapter or book 2 to continue the story. Felt the end wasn't enough.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I can't wait to see the movie trio.  Well written and easy to read, you really get a glimpse into the heart of a Young Katniss whose world and heart are all torn in three different directions at once.
0345529057|2.0|The story line starts well but starts to drag by the end of the series. I found there were just too many characters to follow and while I like the different story lines threading through each other. I struggled to finish book 4 and I've decided not to bother with the last episode as I've lost interest in the characters.
0385523912|5.0|Don't know much about N Korea - but then, I guess few people do. This book was constructed from the memories of 'escapees' from North Korea. It's a fascinating look at a tyrant. For the first time, I could appreciate how the entire populace could be hoodwinked. It's scary in a way. Sad too. Very sad.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This can easily become an addictive game. This was the first game I downloaded to my Kindle and the one I play the most. The eye/hand co-ordination is the key to the game. The only down side is that the game automatically tells you a move if you don't select one within a specified timeframe. In my view this spoils the game.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|After reading Slammed I knew that Colleen Hoover was an author to watch out for but Hopeless has just cemented her place as my favourite new adult author. Yet again she has created an emotional story, one that shredded my heart into teeny tiny pieces and then slowly proceeded to stitch it back together so it was somehow bigger than it was before she started. I don't know how she manages to consistently create such realistic characters, ones that you feel like you could be best friends with and that you are so connected to that you feel everything that they do, but she does it every single time. I have a feeling that this is going to be less a review and more a case of me gushing about how much I loved everything about it so I'm afraid you're going to have to bear with me!<br /><br />It is so, so hard to go into much detail about the plot of this story without giving spoilers, the story is so intricately woven together that I'm terrified of spoiling it for anyone. I think I'm going to focus more on the characters on this occasion so I'll just tell you that whatever you think is going to happen in Hopeless you couldn't be further from the truth, for every part of the plot you guess there are going to be at least 10 things that shock you senseless and just when you think you have it figured out Colleen Hoover is going to spin you around in circles until you're dizzy and feeling slightly sick. As much as this story is an emotional roller coaster one thing it isn't is full of the usual teenage angst, this is much more complex than I was expecting it to be and it made for an incredibly rewarding reading experience.<br /><br />Sky is a fantastic character, she hasn't had it easy but she's the kind of girl who makes the best of things. She doesn't trust people easily but once you break through her barriers she is fiercely loyal to those she cares about. Sky has a tough outer shell and when I first met her I wasn't sure if I was going to like her but it didn't take me long to see how vulnerable she actually is inside, she has suppressed a lot of her past but even though she doesn't consciously remember what happened to her it still effects her reactions every single day. If you loved Will in Slammed you are going to be blown away by Dean Holder. Trust me, Holder is the most wonderful hero I've read about in a long, long time, I don't think it could get much more perfect than him! He has a bad boy image at school but again not everything is what you first think it is and he is actually one of the sweetest boys you could ever meet. I have to warn you that he comes across as a little suspicious to start with, he is obviously keeping secrets from Sky and that can make him act like an ass at times but as you start to uncover more everything will be come so much clearer. He knows that Sky needs extra care and he is determined to be the one to give it to her. The connection that grows between Sky and Holder is beautiful to watch, they open up to each other so gradually and again Colleen Hoover has captured first love perfectly. This author writes bone meltingly good romances and the first kiss was one of the most swoon worthy scenes I've ever read. If only all first kisses could be like that!<br /><br />I  know this review is probably more of a rambling mess but I am still so incredibly invested in Sky and Holder's story that I just want to shout about it from the rooftops. If you're only going to take one recommendation from me over what book to read then I beg you to pick Hopeless. The story is captivating and beautiful romance with a deeper dark undertone that will knock the breath out of you and it's one I'll be thinking about for a long time to come. Hopeless managed to rip my heart to shreds and make me cry my eyes out but it also made me smile, swoon and laugh out loud. It's my favourite book of the year and I can't imagine anything knocking this off the top slot for a long time to come!o see how vulnerable she actually is inside, she has suppressed a lot of her past but even though she doesn't consciously remember what happened to her it still effects her reactions every single day.

B009KS4XRO|2.0|I don't like this game!  IT is very hard for someone that is not well versed in the way on line games work.  There are no good instructions to explain how it works.  You say well if your are not good at modern tech don't get it, but come on people its  BINGO not on line brain surgery.<br />I would not recomend this to anyone.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|if you love bingo this one is fun to play but watch out each game has differnt card coins values and you can use them up real quick but each day you do get more coins  have fun
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|There are no clear instructions on how to play this game, I looked throughout the games settings and couldn't find anything related to how to play this game, even the children were confused. I did delete it as there was nothing I could do. I ended up getting another drawing app that works very well.<br /><br />Also this game asks for a lot of personal information when you use it with Facebook.
B003719G40|5.0|Everyone should read this book. Is a value in all realationships and helpful in understanding how others desire to be treated. I have had my kids and significant other take the test, we all have learnded what we thought worked and why it  didn't.  : )
030758836X|5.0|I almost never read this genre of book & may not have chosen this even with its popularity. But, my book club chose this & I'm so glad!<br /><br />It's really wicked and well written. I loved it & was surprised over & over. It never lagged, always moving, moving. Thanks for writing this very entertaining read!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|These books are magnificently written. The stories of old kings, queens, knight and noble families and low born servants raised to higher stations. This is the second time I have read these books and I have  to say that the first time there were important sentences that were missed . Also, watching the HBO Series helped in understanding the story lines. I look  forward to reading A Dance with Dragons and watching Season 3 of The Game of Thrones on JOB.
0517543052|4.0|My neighbor gave me this book ~ he described it as the original - as we were discussing Ekhart Tolle's  - the Power of Now. I have thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's definitely groovy. I've laughed out loud a few times & also found myself nodding in agreement. I'm thankful to have been introduced to this & his experiences. A different style than  other spiritual books I've read, it's been enjoyable for me. Give it a go
B00AHTYGRW|2.0|I tried to get past the first half of the movie, but I kept falling asleep.  No offense Ben, but it was soooo boring!  I like rock em sock ems and emotional dramas, but seriously... I was just bored.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|overall good game but can freeze on my kindle. I like playing it and so does my son.<br /><br />I will get back to driving now.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great ending to a great story. Definitely would recommend to others. This book really makes you think and appreciate life as we know it.
B005OIAFQC|5.0|it took me a while to pony up for this download since I was sort of lukewarm about the past few VNV releases. they've been spinning &#34;space & time&#34; for a few months at my local industrial club, and it's fun and all - but still - i didn't trust that the entire album would be worth it.<br /><br />well i just listened to the whole thing in it's entirety (with headphones) and i can defintiely say it is worth every penny. yup, i pretty much lost my sh*t several times.<br /><br />up until now, my favorite VNV tracks - the ones that stand the test of time - are Airships and Still Waters. most of the tracks on this album have a similar feel to these. VNV combines totally uplifting, universal lyrics with futuristic arpeggios and epic synth layers that make us fly so high, and even entertain the possibility that maybe - just maybe - we're not as alone as it seems.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|wow I didn't know games could be this cool<br />I love this game<br />I used to play leps world 1 now theres a 2
B0000A98ZP|5.0|This movie is great!  When you put all these kids together you find out one thing and that is they are all the same, one way or another :)
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Yes indeed. This book was great. Loved the nostalgia, the historic significance and the 'what if's'. This book reminded me why I was a huge SK fan years ago. The characters are vibrant and believable. Not a horror story or weirdly twisted but it delivers in a way only SK can.
B000FZETIO|5.0|It was good back in the day and even better today!  I found it to be very entertaining to watch again
B000XUBC5E|3.0|This was the first book I've read from this author. It was decent but not great. It was not as exciting as I had hoped and not very action packed.
034580404X|4.0|I have had this book for sometime now. I just started reading it a few days ago and plan on taking it with me on vacation, so far its pretty good!
B00A83075M|4.0|This is all my 3 year old wants to watch right now! Even I like it. Great for whole family.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I love anything that has to do with jewel legend. This is fun and different. Hours of enjoyment. Well worth the money for the full version.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This installment of James Bond is just as good as, if not better than, Casino Royale. Love the action and the humor as well. Daniel Craig is an awesome actor.
B001GA1RFA|3.0|Really enjoyed his last book so I thought I would read more.  However storyline was not as good. Emotional connection was dieting. Ot fully developed.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|This item rocks easy down load and easy to use. I loaded it on a moto driod thierd generation it works ok
B0035LGXXO|5.0|I saw this movie over thirty years ago, and I still like to watch it. Still great even today, and it was ahead of its time in 1979.
B00000IL1K|5.0|If you have ever heard her voice, you will know what I mean!!!  I first heard her sing the song Deliver Me in a video a friend of mine made as a tribute to the late Jon-Erik Hexum.  The song was used by my friend in Austria as the background music for a montage of photos and video clips of the handsome and talented actor which he had assembled into a video for me.  This song and Sarah's voice lent so much emotion to the video that it made it heartwrenching to know that he died so young and really before his career had time to blossom fully.  If you only buy one of Sarah's CD's, then this is the one you want.  The entire CD is great but Deliver Me is the crown jewel and worth the price.  I also highly recommend the seller, musicshop780, who is located in Argentina and got a five star rating from me as well!!!  ENJOY!!!!
B00BCZU8WM|1.0|This album is awful. The music is so boring and dull much like elevator music. I listened to the entire album, song after song, and I can't tell you what a single song was about. There's nothing special about this album aside from the name of the artist. Try again, and soon Timberlake. If you don't, my bet is that this will be your last album.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I highly recommend this game its a fun way to kill time...its never static its always forever changing its a really good game
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I always Look forward to his books and was excited to read this one. However, this is a long book filled with wise cracking remarks be Detective Corey and very little action. 600 pages of tslk and 10 pages of action. Very dissappointing
B0074VA2T2|3.0|I was hoping it would be a little more exciting. My four year old got bored with it VERY quickly.
B004LROMSY|5.0|Good movie help me realize the fight for our freedom of democracy in America.King Arthur and the knights role and what the would do to protect the kingdom and the  folks.
B005QPMB2Y|4.0|Best viewing app I looked at. Took off one star because there is no way to listen to two cameras at the same time. Any chance of adding this option for the pro app?
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Easy to navigate app for all my favorite feeds. Appealing layout.  Doesn't get a 5 star rating because app occasionally freezes up.
B0007KLH1Y|5.0|When my grandchildren opened this gift my son thought it was lame, just so many plain pieces of wood with no variety. He was converted when he saw that of all their gifts, this was the one they played with most.
B009CWWFD2|3.0|Frankly, I found this Archer plot and its characters boring.  It was hard to plod my way through to an unsatisfactory ending.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|I gave the other Snark Busters a 5 star rating also!  These are wonderful games with great graphics and they are just plain fun! I think everyone would love this. I play it on my KindleFire HD and never had any problems with this game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|THIS APP IS AMAZING!! THE GRAPHICS ON MY KINDLE FIRE HAD ARE AMAZING! The game is very fun and addicting. Great app.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This has to be one of the coolest games I have EVER played! Finding the pairs on the floating cube can sometimes be a little difficult because some tiles are slightly similiar to others but that is what makes this great! The HD graphics on my KindleFire HD 8.9 are absolutely the best of any other game I have played! From looking at the cube far away to seeing it when it is right in front of you on the screen is amazingly clear!  It is easy enough to learn how to rotate the cube and you can try and top your game time over and over. Anyone who sees this in HD will be amazed! Get it!
B00BDZV7WQ|5.0|I like the album a lot.<br /><br />I give the album a 5/5<br /><br />This album is as good his mixtape & exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album, his words choice is intelligent & witty.
B006MQRLSA|4.0|Good film; nice surprise for a non-sports fan like me!  That about sums it up; you won't be bored with this film.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|&#34;Hounded&#34; had me howling with laughter and eagerly turning every Kindle page. If you're an RPG fan or just a fantasy nut, you'll thoroughly enjoy &#34;Hounded.&#34; Hearne infuses an original take on Druidry that is fresh and believable in a setting that fits snuggly onto Google maps. Some tongue-tying Gaelic with which to wrestle, but for me it only adds to the authentic feel of the text. I'd rate it PG-13 for some F-bombs and mild sensuality, but it's still tamer than cable. If you like Celtic knots, &#34;Hounded&#34; will keep tied-up for hours!
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|This film had a lot of potential, but it just didn't quite deliver.  There was a feeling that had the film simply been edited down a bit further, to reduce the length of the film (and the length of every scene) then the old less is more theory would have prevailed and succeeded.  Instead, many interesting scenes just went on too long, and without visual relief.  The story just wasn't compelling enough, and the visual scenes were just each and every one too long and drawn out.  With effective editing, the scenes could have had greater impact.  Great editor/director; but, final result is a result that just isn't yet &#34;done&#34;.  I encourage the director to continue on, because the film does reflect great skill.  Fine acting, though, by Mr. Phoenix!!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great app. No complants. Not a replacement for my actual kindle, but its a great app for using if I can't use my kindle. Also I guess the smoothness of the app would depend on the type of phone you're using and the connection speed you're using.
B009LGO88E|5.0|this makes monster hunter so much easier! and it only takes 1 battery to power for a very long time, and you cant tell from the picture, but it adds 2 more triggers.
B0085Y4JF0|5.0|Love it holds all 9 of my AR mags, 6 1911 mag. I added a holster to the right side and pouch to the left sight for extra items . Comfortable to wear, no loss threads and is built better then most items I had in the army in the 80. A++++. Even thought about get a another for the kid.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I like this book. It was a very nice story, sad at times, but nice all the same. Read it.
B004J64QSI|5.0|The clarity of the vioices and the production are as good as the movie of 2012!!  this is such a great story line and character portrayal that this DVD does justice to.
B00BGD07KS|5.0|This is a wonderful song that goes great with the movie. It makes you want to sing along with it.
B00006AG5N|5.0|I had this CD in 5.1 surround but wanted a copy to listen to in my car and found it for a unbelievable price and it was still sealed.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|I have been a sucker for all of the Star Trek shows, all the way back to the original in the 60's.  I always watched Enterprise when it was originally being broadcast, and started rewatching it when I got my Amazon Prime membership.  I am about 4 episodes into Season 2, and plan to continue watching until I have seen all episodes from all 4 seasons.  If you are truly a sci-fi fan, I think you will enjoy it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like knowing what the weather is supposed to be for the day, hour, or week.  It is also cool to see what weather my northern and western relatives are enjoying.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I could never get the story straight with the way they kept going back to early times.<br />At some point in time they decided to started to tell their story,
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I like connecting with my FB friends thru this funny and creative game.  I am NOT a talented artist by any means, but it is a fun way to play with friends on my lunch hour.
B00BSOBM18|4.0|Very enjoyable concept movie with animation and humans interacting as real life brings out the true acting abilities necessary when you keep in mind it is all done with animation and green screen.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I love the show. It has everything you could want action,love, and zombies. Daril kicks ass I cant wait to see how it all ends.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Puts a different twist on the normal animations of today.  You have evil that is good and evil that is bad all rolled into one
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is addicting.  I love the &#34;servant&#34; characters and the Crawleys and all relations.  Beautiful clothes, beautiful house and scenery and an intriguing story.  I won't ruin it for those who have not seen Season 3, but Matthew is my favorite.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Good movie starts out strong and really plot twists as to the nature of it very poignant meaning can be had from this movie
B005LAJ1H2|4.0|We were given the first year series of Boardwalk Empire for a Christmas present and now we are hooked. Steve Buscemi is a very good &#34;bad guy&#34; portrayer. We will be purchasing the third year series soon.
B00BL5EQLC|3.0|The game is sort of fun... its really frustrating though. For example: Why can't he jump on the red pipes?
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great lol game<br />Fun entertainment enjoyed by the whole family. Cities fast and watch them grow for you. I recommend it
B007N5YIUS|4.0|A great additon to the Angry Birds set of games - plays very well on my Kindle and I like it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is such an awesome game everyone every age should get it.<br />AWESOME! Lovelovelovelove! This awesome game! Amazon apps are good but this has to be the best, get this game
B001BKVWYQ|5.0|A great memento we have framed and hanging in our home to remind us of Rodriguez's amazing story! Buy it and continue to support this great man!
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|An all-time favorite, No problems at all with this product.  Has played with no problems and fine quality picture.<br /><br />Thanks!
B002ZG976U|5.0|great  show  good  singing.  liked  the  musicals  kind  of a  lost  art  these  days  ,  six  more  words  to  print
B008OOYALE|2.0|The cost of crops in relation to time and quantity are preposterous.  The best value are the pumpkinwings at 3200coins you get 225 fruit in 5 hours. That comes out to be 70%return on cost.  All the rest are a waste of time or money with low value of fruit.  Do Not upgrade to the enchanted farm, it is an even bigger waste of money. The value of fruits that the enchanted farm produces is stupid.
B009ZUKY52|4.0|Build quality isn't the greatest. The keys aren't as sensitive and there is some latency that I didn't notice as much with my more expensive midi keyboard. However the size is nice, the transport controls are great and it gets the job done without having to spend a whole lot of money on more expensive options.
B002ZG98FU|5.0|I saw this movie on Netflix. As I said there:<br /><br />I was never much into romantic comedies. If this one counts, and I suppose it may, then this is perhaps only the second I like, but it is more than that, more like Jean-Pierre Jeunet \\"Amélie\\" or Mike Leigh's \\"Happy-Go-Lucky\\" in that it transcends the sum of its parts, and really speaks to the human condition. In other words, yes this is a movie about a woman trying to make it in broadcasting, but it also about the bond between people. Along those lines, though this movie really did make me feel good (there were plenty of good laughs), it was not simply from slapstick. It is no mistake that Rachel McAdams and Harrison Ford are the first two actors listed from the top on the cast below Movie Details on this Netflix page, as this really is THEIR movie; they were a tour de force here, and I have never used that term but find it most apt to use at this moment. By the end of the movie I could not help feeling quite attached to these two. This was a showing much more powerful than the lighthearted-suggestive cover of the movie suggests, though hinted warm, almost uplifting title \\"Morning Glory.\\"
B000N0WCLC|5.0|This account by Edward Zwick leaves a profound impact. Realistically, there cannot be a stop to the Blood Diamonds or to the torture and human slavery that has become entrenched in the African mining and processing life. Rich guys with stars in their eyes give these stones to their girlfriends. A diamond is much sought after; but, there is more bad than good that is mixed in their polish. A diamond has become the bane of so many people's lives in Africa.<br />The United Nations has defined a conflict diamond as one that originates from areas controlled by factions who are opposed to the internationally recognized governments. Conflict diamonds come out of areas at war or engrossed in armed conflicts.<br />Fifteen per cent of the diamonds from the conflict zones are sold to the United States and the money is used to buy weapons for the RUF, a guerilla unit that governs all the mines in the conflict areas.<br />Edward Zwick has taken Sierra Leone of 1999 as his locale and spun a tale that involves a Mende fisherman, Solomon Vandy, who hides a big pink while working as a slave in the mines when his family is taken captive by the Republic United Front guerillas. His relationship with a South African mercenary, Danny Archer, forms the principal part of the tale.<br />Whenever a diamond is found, it brings with it inevitable death as Zwick tries to tell us. The G8 countries have collectively raped Africa out of its rubber, gold, oil and diamonds. The film also invites its audience to look into the Kimberley Process of January 2003 when forty nations signed a pact to look into the evils behind the conflict diamonds.<br />What comes out brilliantly in this film are the scenes of human torture in the sweltering heat among the diamond mines and how a mercenary and a journalist, Maddy Bowen, help the fisherman reunite with his family.<br />Leonardo di Caprio, Djimon Hounsou, Jennifer Connelly and Arnold Vosloo shine in this film. This is one of the best I have seen in recent years. I will rate it AAAA.<br />Certain dialogues from the film cannot escape you. Archer to Maddy: `For the record, I would like to be kissed first before I am f***ed'; `God definitely is not interested in Africa; He left Africa along time ago.'`This is TIA (this is Africa) magic!Solomon Vandy (to his son):`You are Mende and a good boy;do not learn what those brutes taught you;you have to walk to school to learn English; it is important for you to become a doctor.'Maddy to Archer: `You don't care about his(Solomon's) family; you are using him for the stone.'Edward Zwick has made a profound statement with this film. Djimon Hounsou is superb as Solomon Vandy. What can I say about Jennifer Connelly? I would fall in love with her ten times over and in whichever age. Leonardo di Caprio is outstanding as Danny Archer. He has gone under the skin of the role with his Rhodesian accent mastered to perfection and with nuances suggestive of a mercenary who has been brought up in ruthless and cut-throat circumstances. Ever since I saw him as Jack Dawson in `Titanic', I have been impressed with his performances in films like Beach, Romeo and Juliet, Man in the Iron Mask, Gangs of New York, the Departed,Catch me if you Can, Aviator, Shutter Island, Inception, J. Edgar and Django Unchained. The juries behind Oscars and Golden Globes have been ungrateful in recognizing his skills. They have acted as imbeciles in ignoring his talent and not giving him due recognition. I feel that he deserved  at least an Oscar so far. He leaves a haunting impression on you in Blood Diamond.ears. I will rate it AAAA.<br />Certain dialogues from the film cannot escape you.

B005LAIIKI|5.0|Little bit old and new, familiar yet odd, funny and horrific reflections on the reality of slavery and the truly inhumane spirits and uncivilized minds of those who embraced the culture. This aspect of the slave culture is revealed through the character Django. Who is separated from his woman simply due to the skin he and she are in, therefore seen as property and not human beings. He is given the chance to earn his freedom and possibly his woman's freedom too. By assisting a (white) English bounty hunter track down and arrest or kill three (white) criminals who he (Django) can identify.
B00AU15HPC|4.0|A &#34;must-have&#34; for real fans.  Great music, and GREAT lyrics!  It's nice to see that &#34;the Voice&#34; is still the same----only better with age.
B001200OFS|3.0|I love Nickelback, but this isn't the best album by far.  I enjoy several other of the albums more, but this one is good.
B005UDD1R6|3.0|I have one mp4 file that it will show perfectly for about the first 10 minutes. It then says I need a codec that is found in another app. When I try to install the other app, I am told that the app is not compatible with my device. I can never get beyond that 10 minute point. It is very frustrating sine it plays the first 10 minutes with no issue...I want to use my Fire to show training videos at work. This is the only app that appears to work with this exception.
B004BRQYJ4|5.0|Awesome soundtrack and movie!  I really enjoy this soundtrack and listen to it often.  Good listen, highly recommend. You won't be sorry.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|nice concept for a book, i was so enthralled i read the whole thing in one day, i would recommend
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This app is perfect to keep up with the things you need, I have separate little sticky notes for different things, so when I leave home guess what, I have those notes with me not stuck on the refrigerator. Could not ask for anything more, it does what it says, keeps up with your notes.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|I figured I would just describe the sound of this album for the sake of giving folks an idea of how Delta Machine differs from past DM classics.<br /><br />First off, yes, this does continue the buzzy uber-analog sound of the past two records. Whether you like that or not is a matter of taste. Personally I think PTA is one of their best outings.  *shrug*<br /><br />Delta Machine is DM's most stripped down album structurally speaking. Sparse beats and moogy synth bass sequences with the occasional metallic lead effect - this is the bread and butter of this album musically. All of this combined with the bluesy twang of Violator and Songs of Faith & Devotion. Funny enough, this record reminds me of Fad Gadget, Mute Record's first signing before Depeche Mode. Very dark, brooding, and strangely melodic.<br /><br />It's the lack of catchy tunes that has divided fans I think. While I would welcome another record like Music For The Masses or Violator with open arms, it is not to be. I'm just happy they are still around, experimenting with their sound like they have here. I thought I would be put off by the heavy religious lyrical allusions, but the overall tone is so dark it comes off as cynical, and I like that.<br /><br />It all reminds me of classic early 80's underground synth bands, just like Depeche Mode themselves were at the beginning. Something about a Moog bass sequence can get me moving.<br /><br />Not their best album by a long shot, but not as empty as Exciter. If you are into dark, sparse minimal wave you will love Delta Machine. Its a challenging, but satisfying experience. They went for beauty through simplicity this time around and it makes for a unique listening experience indeed.
B00884GR0W|5.0|Awesome game I'm not a game person but this game really spiked my interest!!!<br />I played Thai game everyday!! (OK not every day but most of my free time) it's very entertaining and fun. You get to create your own world and rule it to!!!
B00BHMETKC|2.0|I would not recommend this movie.  it is greatly over hyped and should not have won the Best Picture Oscar.  I found friend and foe were stereotyped and seemed two dimensional.  The storytelling was stilted without coherent flow.<br />Argo might have a niche as a not very believable propaganda movie.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|This sucks and I think it is not going to be popular but still it was still boring because of the way it was sucky but I had to give it a star but I really didn't
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This is a most entertaining movie that should have won the Best Picture Oscar.  Visually it is inspiring and the story riveting.  These two criteria are the most important for any movie and Life of Pi satisfies.  This movie is such a delight it is hard not to go over the top describing the pleasure I experienced.  Please buy this movie so you can watch it often.  You will never tire of watching Life of Pi.

0741470314|5.0|Dr. Moriaty writes in a straightforward, engaging way on many aspects of Michael Jackson's life.  There are chapters on his complex legal and financial challenges; the devastation of the 2005 trial; Michael as healer and philanthropist; the dedication to his role as a father.<br /><br />The most engaging part of the book for me was when Dr. Moriarity wrote about Michael and his security team.  As I read this chapter, I became mesmerized - and a little heartbroken - by the extraordinary measures his bodyguards took to ensure the safety of Michael and his children. The stories shared by his bodyguards gave a glimpse into Michael's heart and mind; his vulnerability and fears.  The stories revealed how, in many ways, Michael was a prisoner in his own home, a prisoner of his enormous fame.<br /><br />After reading this book, I feel I understand Michael the human being (not the superstar) more deeply.  Since his death in 2009, I've studied Michael extensively.  Not only have I read countless books, articles, and blog posts.  I've viewed hundreds of videos that expanded my understanding of this person named Michael Jackson.<br /><br />Dr. Moriarty brings much of the information I've read and seen into a single volume.  If you want a comprehensive book that gives a look at the many aspects of the life of Michael Jackson, I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />Get a copy for your 'Michael Collection'.  And buy one for a friend too!<br /><br />Gerri Stone
B0041OT9W6|4.0|I really liked it. It was just like any other young preteen writing a diary. We all have had emotional hormones flying everywhere and she is very intelligent. I recommend!!
B00004YTZE|5.0|You might have mixed feelings about this record. Apparently the initial vinyl pressings suffered from a mastering error, which led to mixed reviews upon its release, and understandably, much frustration from the band members themselves. If you got into music in the '90s & beyond (much like myself), this CD is no doubt the only version of L.A.M.F. that you've ever heard. And good hell, what a killer recording this is. Had it been originally released in this form, with flattering mixes and fine mastering, the critical elite and record-buying public wouldn't have been able to deny the presentation of great songs front to back. To the uninitiated, stop wondering--this is an all-time classic punk recording that stands head & shoulders above most anything in R&R and beyond.
B005BRS8Z6|2.0|I think the &#34;agreements&#34; themselves are sound and worth internalizing. This is not new stuff, yet it bears repeating.  I'm just a bit put off by reducing the &#34;secret&#34; to a good life to four agreements (or seven habits or a one-digit number of truths). The book is short. Just not short enough.

1451695195|5.0|His story is almost unbelieveable, but I definitely do believe it.  A most inspiring message.  I have read other NDE books and found this one at the top of the list.  it doesn't hit you over the head with religion, but with a loving spiritual message.  A book  for all those with an open mind.
B009MO5960|5.0|I really enjoy the Resident Evil franchise. So like those I enjoyed Retribution as well. So if your a fan of the previous films then you will like this one.

B003O86FMW|4.0|Yes, I liked it but the story wasn't all that different from the first one in the series. I'll spare the details lest I spoil the story. Still, quite the entertaining read. I definitely recommend it.<br />For some reason when I was reading the series, my friends told me they were &#34;girl books&#34;. Best I could figure, they never read the book so how could they even know?
B00821PCJS|4.0|The series was ok with no commercials and no waiting for weeks. like I said, too many rules rules rules. There, you got your x amount of words.
1451695195|5.0|Dr. Alexander does an outstanding job of relating his experience and also of expressing his &#34;takeaways&#34; from that experience.  It is by far the best NDE book I have read in two respects:  1) it is largely a detailed review of the actual near death experience itself and 2)  it is extremely well-written.  Too often, I have found NDE books to be light on the actual experience and heavy on the author's life following the experience.  This is absolutely not the case with Proof -- the details of the &#34;time&#34; spent out of our known universe are enthralling.  It also helps that Dr. Alexander is able to provide medical and scientific analysis of what happened to him and why his experience is both extraordinary and, while difficult to believe, IS very understandable and believable.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Copycat of Shades of Gray.  It started out very similar but did get better.  Not sure if I'll read any more.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|Used this as well as others. Had it setup to learn as well. Doesn't like words I setup. Likes to pick is own words when trying to get the right one. Like or. It likes to do put out or our. Could be better.

B00BUL0XYG|5.0|So first of all I'm a Strokes fan.  I love everyone of their albums, but certainly I'd say some are better than others. Angles caught everybody off guard with a new sound, and some people didn't stick around to appreciate it. With Comedown Machine, nobody should be caught off guard, it's that same 80's mixed with classic Strokes sound. But this time, it seems that the band is more comfortable and it doesn't seem like an experiement like Angles, it seems like this is now the sound of the band. One thing with this album, you gotta give it more than one spin. The music is too innovative and futuristic for the average person's ear to capture it in first listen. By the third time you listen to this complete ablum, you should understand why this is one of the most progressive bands still playing and they don't give a damn about anything except their art. Standouts for me are the opener Tap out, the old school Strokes rocker 50/50, and the best song on the album- Welcome to Japan. If this were a new band not named the Strokes, with no history, it would be getting universal acclaim and one of the top records of the year. Sometimes it's hard for ordinary people, aka critics, to grasp something special, even when its playing right in their ear. Thank you to the Strokes for putting out an album that at the very least, is something different, and my opinion, something very special.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I love it it it good movie and the 3D  , can se it over,over again.I say it in theatre in 2D. See it in 3D is cool.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Hi, I am Jay and I don't like temple run 2.<br /><br />I don't think it is very fun. I only give it*. The only thing I like is that it is free. So it wasn't a waste of money.<br /><br />Hi, I'm Gymnastics zebra and this is what I think of Temple Run 2. It is very fun and challenging. I gave it the four star review.<br /><br />If I were to give ideas for the game, I would suggest a beginner level. Something that shows how to play or gives you a place to practice. In the game it just starts off challenging.<br /><br />The last paragraph is the reason why I took the star off. The game is way to hard for beginners.<br /><br />The object of the game is to run from a monster that is chasing you. You have to jump and dodge obstacles. You ride across zip lines and jump to pick up speed. You collect coins and if you collect gems you can use a little feature called save me when you fall off. It puts you right where you left off.<br /><br />Jay and Gymnastics zebra

B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Bowie and Visconti in high form. I frankly didn't think Bowie had another album like this in him. Bowie has always had a talent for constructing catchy, memorable rock. He also thrives in the right partnerships. Its all present here. I'm okay with the melodies being a little derivative - for once, Bowie is mining the best parts of his work instead of trying to pointlessly immerse himself into the cultural zeitgeist. I'm glad Bowie isn't concerning himself with the cutting edge here - at his age it would be silly, and it would deprive us all of what we really want - a David Bowie album. Maybe Visconti helped guide him back to his strengths. Anyone who loves Bowie but wouldn't touch any of the work from the last two decades should definitely try The Next Day. Had Bowie released this album instead of veering into Glass Spider territory, the last three decades might have been much different.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|This is an interesting movie. It shows the influence of alcohol on a very important job. We all should be so lucky.

B009IJJ5B4|4.0|good characters. clever cases. good chemistry between miller lu and Quinn.  black detective is excellent.  not too screwed up and can watch with kids.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|I thought the story was a good one, interesting and not EXACTLY predictable, all things considered.  I just get tired of every movie being peppered with vulgar language.  It wasn't so much a surprise coming from Clint Eastwood, athough he could have played his part just as well without it, but to have Amy Adams spouting words fit for a sailor was a little disappointing.  To be fair, there wasn't a LOT of language in this movie, which is why it stayed at a PG-13 rating, I suppose, but it still gets tiresome.

B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I've seen some complaints about how this movie centers on the 13th Amendment and not more on Lincoln's life as a whole. Maybe the movie could have been titled more accordingly, but that didn't seem to bother me at all... And with regards to the 13th Amendment, I'm very pleased to see this movie centered on it because regardless of whether or not people approved of this Amendment, it was a HUGE and IMPORTANT thing regardless :D

B000MAOLVW|5.0|I saw this movie when it came out in 1966 in the Cenerama Theater in St. Louis.  I like and value the movie so highly that I hesitate to use the tired old phrases to rave about it.  It is so rich in quality in every judgement area that it appears to me that this was a movie made to be the best it could be without consideration for difficulty or cost - quality in every way was all that would be acceptable.  The richness of the color and the crispness of image in the photography at the actual Grand Prix race courses of the world is beyond compare.  The casting of characters and their emersion into the roles to play out their individual but blended stories is perfect.  Of course I knew James Garner as a favorite actor but I became aware of Yves Montand through his great performance for the first time. The story has depth and is developed fully.  Top Grand Prix racers of that time make small acting appearances in the film - Phil Hill (American) and Graham Hill (English) for example.  The theme song is sublime.<br /><br />Now approaching 50 years later I fly my RV-6A airplane that my wife Jeanine and I built in our garage before I retired, in Sport Air Racing League cross country air races across the US at over 200 miles per hour.  I watch this movie and &#34;The Worlds Fastest Indian&#34; at least once before the start of each season.  I have bought many copies of both DVDs and the Mystic Moods CD album &#34;More than Music&#34; containing the Grand Prix theme and given them to my younger racing friends to share this great experience.<br /><br />Yes, I like the movie.<br /><br />Bob Axsom
B000WN60NG|5.0|Great movie, great music! What else is there to say?<br /><br />Awesome mythology of real southern blues legends mixed with a fun story!
B0038AUY96|4.0|I liked it. A clever and complex interweaving of plot and personalities, and a flawed detective really did it for me.
B007X4N0DU|5.0|Wow, inspirational pumping good album. Why don't they make more albums. It should be in the European charts. A good mix of harder and soft.

B002SSUQFG|5.0|Looks very nice (clean) in person.  I intended to swap out the strap for a leather one but the nylon is not bad and I'll probably keep it till it wears out. The presentation in the box was great and I would not hesitate to buy this gift as a watch for someone as the price to wow factor makes it a great value.  I have another Seiko watch that is five years old and still working great so I have faith in the brand.<br /><br />The luminescence on the dials is great at night too.  I woke up at about 5am and sure enough I could tell the time by the faint glow on my wrist. That was about 7 hours of glow.<br /><br />This is my first 'automatic' watch and having no battery is a novel concept.  I've heard that losing 1-3 seconds a day is the norm so I guess I will have to adjust the time every week or so.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wasn't expecting the the way the story turned, but liked that they tied up the loose ends so you could close the characters.  However, I think they could have kept the storyline going if they hadn't started the family.
B004GYY714|4.0|Not much to say.  It plays music for me over the internet.<br /><br />The app itself does seem a little bit glitchy as it stops/buffers/etc. more frequently than Pandora radio on the same network/connection.  However I do not see one replacing the other so I use both frequently.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Although not sure why they called it &#34;darker&#34;.  It's a great story.  Kept my attention through the whole book.  Highly recommend reading the entire trilogy
B0030ZOYHC|4.0|A slightly crisper and enhanced version of 1.01.  Nothing special.  It's the same movie only blue ray.  There are alot of extras however.  It could be worth it for major fans
B000B894AI|5.0|I have devoured every book this author has written; all the way back to his first novel.  His writing style has improved considerably from his first book he wrote.  When an author can get your attention on the first page and keep it, it will be a good suspense thriller.  That is what David Baldacci does in every book.  I could turn the pages fast enough to find out the next chapter.  Im read all of John Grishams books, but David Baldacci has him beat.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|My niece recommended this to me, she loves hers. I am very happy with the way it feels and writes. So much better than a regular stylus.
B000002UZ4|5.0|This is the 2nd time I have bought this CD, the first one was badly scratched on one of the songs.  I did not buy the 1st one from Amazon.  The music is catchy and all of the songs have a good beat.  I play it when cleaning the house and it gets me moving, so cleaning doesnt seem like cleaning.  The first time I bought the CD was on a whim, it had a song that I really liked.  When listening to the rest of the CD, I liked all the songs.  So enjoy and clean to your hearts content.
B005COO1X6|1.0|Ridiculous plot.  Appeals to the mind of a twelve year old boy fascinated by aliens. I love a good mystery, but come on, man eating cars?!
B000679N96|4.0|Three Imaginary Boys (Dlx) (Dig) is the debut album and with this deluxe re-release one can hear many home demo's, studio demo's, studio out-take's and early live songs. Many of the tracks on the second CD have been previously unreleased. The sound is primitive and it is more dirty and gritty then later Cure albums. One can call the sound on this album Post-Punk. Johnny Black has written the music notes. Recommended. 4/5.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I gave this a 4 star rating because even though I saw the movie, I read the first book and enjoyed every minute.  It was a real page-turner!  The author captured the essence of a 14 year old, responsible young lady, mixed it with a corrupt adult world, and provided an adventure that kept me entertained and looking forward to the next chapter and book.  Nicely done!
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Typical of all of his books if you can fight past the boredom of the beginning of the book the end is worth the reward.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book was very inspiring for me. Really good concepts for a  successful relationship. I would recommend to anyone married or single.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|It entertained me and inspired me in a few ways to follow my little dreams. Its a cute romance too!
B005NPCUC8|5.0|AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME! Brought back so many good memories. The sound is just as good as it gets!  Great album all of the sounds are good.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Just takes time to play. Would most likely be great for a road trip. Make sure to save your gems up!
B000ID37KO|5.0|Love this movie and love having it available online to watch whenever I want!  I love shopping with Amazon and it is the first site I go to when I need something!
0375703764|3.0|Started out scary but ended with a meh. Well written just didn't like the direction the author took with it. I became so complacent with it I didn't finish the extras in the back.
B00AHSINKO|4.0|This was decent; Was funny, but I wish my husband would have liked it a little better than he did.
B004XMMSZG|5.0|Works well with my older Bose sound dock. Small enough to fit without interfering Item received sooner than I had expected.
B0083GQKQG|1.0|Probably one of the worst movies I have ever watched.  It was painful to sit through and a waste of my time
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|i read this book in 1 day it was so good. BUT YOU HAVE TO READ SHIVER AND LINGER BEFORE THIS ONE!!!!!!!!! my mom read these and told me they were great, and she didnt lie!!!
B003VDY7XE|4.0|This is an interesting show.  Took a little to get into though.  I like how it does not leave me hanging at the end of the episodes, but the characters take some time to warm up to.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|i got this because i had nothing to read and it was 2.99 on kindle store so i decided &#34;what the heck?&#34;. needless to say i had to make myself read slow so it would actually last ore that a day this book was so good. READ THIS BOOK. thats all i have to say,
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My grandchildren love this one. It is great for their age level, and is teaching them logic solving. Good game.
B003NHRGSQ|5.0|i had to force my self to read this slow, but i soo gave up because it was so good. BUT YOU HAVE TO READ SHIVER BEFORE THIS ONE!!!!!!!! my mom read all the books and said thay were great, and she didnt lie1!!
0205606288|5.0|I gave this book a five-star rating because it supplies a lot of background information that is needed to understand the poems and plays that are presented in the book.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Reading A Dance with Dragons is a bit like being a girl when the boy finishes early.  The story teases the reader into a frenzy with all the whispers and promises of an epic climax.  Then the reader turns the page and the book is finished.  Over. Done.  So sorry.  Come back in five years to read the end of this book at the beginning of the next.  Deflated and frustrated, the reader is robbed.<br /><br />Why, oh why, you might ask, would I give the book with no ending four stars?  Because Martin is still a master storyteller, a genius with prose, and the ultimate connoisseur of character.  When these three reach perfection, no story could be made better.  Except by adding an ending.  An ending would be better.
B004HWYTP4|1.0|I purchased this movie and it would not play. I am extremely dissatisfied. I would like the return of my money
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the game, I would recommend it to friends. It's a game I can play at my leisure. Nice game
B00A0SJWQU|1.0|It streamed well but the movie itself was a little disappointing.<br />Not even close to the first one.<br />Would recommend the service but not the movie.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I like Facebook but at times it has too many changes and needs too much info on you.I will continue to use it but not as much as I used to. Need help and cannot get it, talk to a FB support tech and was very concerned at what he asked me and will not contact them again.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Downton Abbey seasons 1 & 2 edition is the perfect edition to view the entire series at my discretion; several episodes at one sitting.
B00BBRPRDG|4.0|It's rather difficult for a band who staked their claim to the alternative country genre back in 1968, not to sound or seem a bit rehashed, or wallowing in a past filled with glories that might have been ... but Poco, with a legendary collection of talent, have stepped into a new century still sounding important, still sounding true to their roots, fresh, and ready to take it to the limits.<br /><br />Pickin' Up The Pieces\\" has always been Poco's defining moment, and since that time, perhaps even during that time, the influx of musicians in and out of the band has been staggering, a virtual who's who of musical talent, including Jim Messina, Richie Furay, Randy Meisner, Rusty Young, and even Gram Parsons for a very short while ... and inspiring bands like: The Eagles, The Byrds, The Beatles [George Harrison could often be found at a Poco show], The Flying Burrito Brothers, Pure Prairie League, Little River Band, Crosby Stills & Nash, and even Neil Young.<br /><br />All Fired Up could have been written and recorded forty years ago, and splintered the floorboards of countless dance halls.  Poco's still writing their musical narrative, stacking the deck with sensational songs, songs that glisten in the sun and are filled with never ending harmonies, inspiring me to feel that just around the bend, on a deserted desert highway, I might pass a vintage van shot with gray primer, windows open wide and the radio blaring.  All Fired Up is a step through the past darkly, and in the same breath it's a new blazing adventure into a musical realm by a group of guys who continue to prove that no one does it better.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Trust me when I say that I dont write reviews, but this time I have changed my mind and decided to let people know that this book is the answer to any of their questions regarding bodybuilding. No matter at what level you are starting out, read this book before you hit the gym and you will be glad you did that. For someone like me who does not know anything about bodybuilding or working out, this book was the savior. I started working out by following transformation videos on bodybuiliding.com. I saw some really small initial gains and then nothing at all. I used to workout for 1.5-2 hours 4-5 times a week and saw no results. then i came across this book and it really educated me about the science of bodybuilding. this is no BS book that will only give you workout routines and exercises, it educates you about the basics of muscle building. after reading it you will know exactly where you were going wrong. Mike has done a gr8 job on giving references with all the claims in his book. Mike is also very approachable. He is like a personal trainer to you. if you contact him on facebook or even email him, he will be more than happy to help you with anything you want. it makes it so much more motivating to go out there and hit it hard! i am still just starting out and i tried to find routines and workouts online for people who dont know anything about muscle building, but all i could find is transformation workouts for people who already have been working out for years. no matter where you are starting from, this book will give you all you need to get BIG!! Kudos to Mike for writing this book. I talk to Mike via emails whenever I have questions and he replies to you the same day!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I think this app is great and highly recommend it. it takes up lots of time though.other than that this app is great.
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|It's a fun game, but it sucks that in order to win you have to spend real money.  Everyone is out to make a buck.
B001D0BLTA|4.0|I enjoyed the nostalgic visit down memory lane and appreciated the story line.  (it actually HAS a story line)<br /><br />Worth watching.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game very realistic. So many horse and jumping is fun competition is cool I'm going to give this a five star rating
B004HW7JH4|5.0|love the Mad Men series and have totally enjoyed watching this DVD set. And it makes a great addition to my DVD collection
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I wish there wasn't such a time crunch.too much pressure. Not all games have to be about lightning fast accomplishment.I'll keep playing.but probably only for a day or so. Stupid time restraint. Wish I could just enjoy the drive.
B000IYU9IG|5.0|The move plays well it was just was not the movie I thought it was. It might make my brother a great gift..
B007W1BLN0|3.0|The acting was good. The story, although a true story ( I think) was weird. I did not like the ending at all!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Its so cool cause I love its hard level.. so fun is a must download like I said so fun!!! MUST DOWNLOAD!!!!!!!!:);)
B00138F0MQ|5.0|I've heard many works over the years and I like different artists works for different reasons.  However, what I have found defines the best in a given year comes down to how well recorded it was.  The year that Toto IV was done, it would be hard to argue that anything came close to the engineering excellence of that project.  Note that it also won the Grammy for Best Engineered Recording - Non Classical and it was richly deserved, as well as the so-called major awards of Album of the Year and Record of the Year, and others.  This, in my humble opinion, is what made it the best album of that year.  I always find it strange when one album wins the Best Album Grammy and another one wins for Engineering. How can the best Engineered work not be the best work of the year? I guess I'll never know that one.  Probably because only Mixing and Mastering Engineers vote on that one and maybe everyone else votes on the other one.<br /><br />If you have a good setup and you enjoy well recorded work, and this is especially true if you have an SACD setup this is absolutely brilliant. And the songs are not that bad either! Fantastic arrangements, vocals, and top-notch playing from guys who honed their skills backing some of the best in the industry.  The industry honored them with a ton of awards and they were richly deserved and it stands the test of time. Note that although this shows under the MP3 version of this work, this review is for the non-MP3 version of the work, as MP3 cuts many of the frequencies, which is it's main shortcoming. For the best results, and the fullest fidelity, get the original CD, a remastered version or the SACD version, which is by far, the best version of the work.  The engineering is superb! One of the best engineered non-classical works ever! Right up there with Steely Dan's-Aja, Michael Jackson's-Thriller and Dangerous, to name a few and all of which walked away with the Best Engineered non-classical Grammy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Well this game is so much fun if I could I would play it all night.It is amazing really fun to play and I would recommend others to play subway surfers.
B0091REZMW|2.0|I don't do a lot of game playing but this is confusing.  I'm still playing so there must be something good.
B003KGBISY|1.0|I live in Australia<br />We have different viewing formats<br />This did not play<br /><br />MOST I have bought off Amazon . . .<br />I have been always very happy with purchases and have been able to play the DVDs<br /><br />So very hard to write a review when you havn't seen the movie<br />I was SO looking forward to seeing these classics (I also purchased The Samurai Trilogy - Toshiro Mifune as well)<br /><br />VERY disappointed
B00BTABOCS|5.0|Not a dud on this album, just classic Maiden. Sounds great, but know that the encore tracks remain unremastered, but they still sound fine.
0385344228|3.0|This was an interesting legal drama.  I found myself thinking about the tragedies in the story multiple times during the day--thinking about the actions of the characters and wondering how it would all turn out.  It was a satisfying, though depressing, story.
B000WQWPJQ|5.0|I had to write my own, brief review of this film after seeing so many ridiculously negative ones.  This movie succeeds in every way.  Too many movies anymore are big budgets and not much else.  We have such short attention spans that unless there is a friggin' explosion every 10 minutes we can't sit through it.  This movie is for people that love good stories, that can sit through a slow-moving, methodical movie.  Do NOT rent/buy this if  you want some action-packed edge of your seat thriller.  It's not that kind of movie.  The thought of being stranded like Tom is so overwhelmingly depressing, yet there are moments where I couldn't stop laughing.  It's an emotional journey from start to finish.  The ending rips my heart out every time I see it.  To think he survived from the inspiration of his girlfriend only to get back home to find that she has moved on is so sad it brings me to tears every time.  A great movie and one that I always watch at least some of when I see it on TV.  And for those of you who don't \\"get\\" the ending.  His life was all about structure and schedules before he was stranded.  After he gets back and finds that the one thing he lived for is gone, he has to find a new direction-hence the standing at a crossroads at the end thinking about where to go next.  His life is now wide open with any number of choices and ways to go.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|its fun and freerome and worth it bu the price changes. last week it was one roller now its seven dollers.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|this movie was great. It definitely exceeded my expectations! if you have yet to see this or are unsure then just believe me when I say it is worth it.
B0086700CM|5.0|This was recommended to me by other family members.  I find it challenging but fun.  Hope to improve my score with time.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|I totally forgot how cool this movie is. I haven't see in since I was about 7 years old and that is like 40 years ago. A must see and scary for the 60's
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of my favorite games. Its a great game to play when you're bored and have nothing to do. Get it now.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is by far the best bingo game online! I play every day for hours and never get tired of the game!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a awesome game it is a lot more fun than temple run u should get this app u will not regret it!!!!!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game was chosen by my niece Maya. I was visiting her and it snowed and we could do the activity we have planned. She chose this game and enjoyed. It save me from her being disappointed due to the weather
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|This is a flawless masterpiece of contemporary pop music. This is a strong, elegant, excellent execution. The competitors are smoking nervous aside. Timberlake is above the usual. Bravo. Bravissimo. Beautiful. Strawberry Bubblegum awesome!
B009CG0102|5.0|Amazing story about the space program and inspirational elements of traveling to thw moon. It emphasizes safety, teamwork, and critical problem solving. The acting is terrific.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I loved how each character had a different vision<br />it also shows courage and it shows friendship<br />if you haven't read it read it
1609611543|4.0|I like the detail, but also wish there was a condensed version.  I was not as interested in the medical advice as I was in creating a lifelong habit of eating well and living better.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I loved The Lord of the Rings movies, so I knew I would love The Hobbit.<br /><br />I saw it in theaters and thought it was very different from the book....Until I re-read it!<br /><br />Yes, the white Orc is not in the book and adds drama. No, that wasn't completely necessary to the film.<br /><br />Yes, Radagast was not in the book. I really enjoyed the addition, though!<br /><br />Yes, the White Council wasn't in the book, but it did help tie back to Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />Yes, it was still an awesome movie!!<br /><br />The scenery is gorgeous, the characters are entertaining, there is plenty of action, drama, and humor.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film!!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and would definitely recommend to others.  The singing was very good as was the story line.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Please update this Amazon! Long have I waited for these updates, Cloud City and Boba Fett Missions.<br />But as iPhone, iPod, iPad, DROID, and Samsung enjoy the luxury of updates the moment they come out, long have the Amazon people had to wait for the council of Amazon Representatives to update our games. (heh heh) But really, PLEASE UPDATE!
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|We were not sure when ordering this movie, but it turned out to be an excellent choice.  Would recommend to others.
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|Great quality sound all through the set. It is so pleasing to pop all 5 discs in Bose System and feel like I am at an actual concert. I have always loved the talent of Stephen Stills with the acoustic guitar and his flawless vocal skills. This is a must own if there are any of you out there looking for a true to life sound in anything by this acoustic master or the rest that he has played and joined talents with in the last 50 years. I am very pleased with the quick delivery and the wonderful 125 page booklet filled with pictures and info all about Stephen Stills from beginning to present. You will not be disappointed with this purchase.
0307704076|5.0|This was and is a very good book to listen to every day to reinforce the change we can make in our lives to live a better life.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|Accurate writing of the teenagers life. Hilarious, adventurous, and humbling. Really opens up the mind & it's possibilities. Perfect in every way.
B0018AM1YY|5.0|thanks to this seller I can continue adding to my favorite hits with out ever leaving my house , and at a great price I shall return shortly to purchace some more of the great hits
B0096HL33G|2.0|This movie has to be all time best the cure for insomnia.  Perhaps the most dull movie I started but never finished.
0793518326|1.0|Do not buy unless you can easily enlarge this print.<br />It is not a piano book, you need a four piece band to play the real deal.<br />Would cost 20 bucks to ship it back, just a horrible buy
B007BVOEPI|4.0|Entertaining! This show is fun to watch. It has multiple story lines, which can be annoying, but as long as you don't mind the skipping around, it's great!
B008LC8TJI|5.0|Ok ..no secret that I do love Maroon 5...and this album did NOT disappoint me in anyway , shape or form. The 3 hits off the album I already loved..but there are many more catchy tunes on this album that do not disappoint !!!! I find myself humming the songs that aren't the hits through the day...because to me the music and words stay in my mind and I'll just keep on singing them to myself. Especially the last song on the album.....for some reason its really gotten ahold of me and I'm singing it right now in fact ! lol
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|It's confusing because the application opens to voice recognition which my tablet doesn't have.  I'm not sure how to use it.  I get what I want by blundering through several steps.  I'd like it to be direct.  I want to type in what I'm looking for and it gives me suggestions.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Ok what more can I tell you about bingo that you don't already know ??!! Its addicting and in this game you have the Daily 5 free games you can play ..plus they have a variety of slots for people who like that...but I don't, so I just pretty much stick to the Bingo games. Its all different rooms from different countries where you can accumulate different treasures from that country and when you get all of them from that one country...you get more bingo  &#34; chips &#34; to play with each day...LOVE this game !
B009FZFONO|5.0|Great story - great character development - great acting.<br />If there were no zombies it would still be a really good story of people coming together in a time a terrible trials and tribulations.
B00846F1YW|5.0|Love this game because I love finding hidden objects and putting puzzles together and just solving things in general and this one game has ALL of them and more. The story part is ok...gets a bit monotonous ....but I'm sure some people love to read the story along with the puzzles as well....just not my thing. But all in all ..I really enjoy playing this game .
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|Bought as a girlf for my girlfriend, andshe is going to love it. The price was too amazing to give up. Truely a great buy for any potter head :3
B002R5QPRI|5.0|I never tire of the Costner-Houston chemistry, the music, the action and the passion. It is a shame they will never work together again.
B00BL5EQLC|4.0|A runner game using swipe controls to run right, left, duck down, and jump (or double jump), the game focuses on you running and jumping to pick up packages, then deliver the packages to a handler. In a way, the game play is similar to what's happening in Little Big Planet, with swipe/touch integration. There is a nice touch of obstacles to run around, and stairways to jump up and down.<br /><br />The graphics are done well, the character and the backgrounds both look nice in 3D. The only problem I have is that the controls could still use a little improvement, running right/then left/then having to jump is a chore at times, and gets annoying having to try it more than once. With that said, the game is still enjoyable, and the levels go from easy to more difficult, as they should, and are varied.<br />(Kindle Fire HD)
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|it sucks and I hate it...why is there a stupid 20 word minimum....?..... its dumb. Coin dozed is a waste of everyones time and it makes me fall asleep.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|From page one, I was hooked!  Stephen King definitely stepped outside his box to write this one, but his style was definitely there.  The details of the Kennedy assassination were spot on.  The description of Oswald, his family and co-horts was riveting.  I really loved the way he described time travel.  Clear your slate before you start this book, because you will not put it down until it's finished.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|I have been listening to the same CD for 6 hours. I know...a little too much! But each song has a different story which he tells, and it is really good. My favorite is the first song, \\"Boys \\"Round Here\\" Chew Tobacco Chew Tobacco Chew Tobacco Spit
B007HC3LHS|5.0|What started as a beautiful love affair went horribly wrong!  The main character, Catherine, had to keep looking over her shoulder, keep looking around every corner and could never let her guard down.  I liked the way the book flashed between 2004 when the affair started and 2008 when Catherine was living with the horrible past!  It's another book you won't put down before it's finished!
B0094K1MH2|4.0|I was a big fan of Tintin comic books as a child in Canada so I was curious to see how they could adapt the pages to film. They did a pretty good job of it! I was thoroughly entertained from beginning to end and hope to see more of the series brought to the screen.
B00632HWOG|4.0|It's very helpful and easy to use I like the app. If you have yahoo mail you should get it.
B00AWQEKIK|3.0|This set is impressive, I'm happy them didn't make this a 3-disc set like Crosby's and Nash's are.  Alas, there's finally an 'S' between my 'C' and 'N' boxed sets.  Why only four stars?  First, this set should've been released in HDCD and wasn't.  Many folks who care about getting the best possible sound out of a redbook CD appreciate when this process is applied in the remastering stage, as it was for the Crosby and Nash sets.  Why the heck wasn't it used here?  Not a good choice.  Second issue: I was hoping a high-quality remaster would be available for the first time of a few of Stephen's Deja Vu contributions (with original mixes), but only one new one is here (Woodstock) and, again, it's not even in HDCD.  Trying to put together your own high-quality version of Deja Vu from best available sources?  This set doesn't help much, unfortunately.  Crosby's, Nash's and Young's contributions to that album are available (in HDCD) from their own sets, as is Stills' \\"Carry On\\" from a recent Greatest Hits package, but how about a remastered original mix of \\"4 + 20\\" and \\"Everybody I Love You\\"?  C'mon, folks.
1401216676|5.0|I had been recommended 'The Killing Joke' after reading 'Kingdom Come'. Received the novel in less than a week in perfect condition. I didn't even realize it was a hardcover for such a great price! I highly recommend getting it if your a batman/joker/alan moore fan.
B000V39KDO|5.0|This movie set the standard for all other films like it. The artistic value will never cease to amaze me.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|This book came to me as a book club choice, and I can say that it is a book worthy of such discussion.  Thought provoking and emotionally wrought, it is also more than predictable, though I didn't mind at all.  It's an easy, quick read that will give you some moments of thought, reflection and joy.  It's not life changing, but if you know what to expect and you don't ask it to be more, then you will be very satisfied with the investment you have made to read it.
B00BP4Z8XY|1.0|I decided to give it a viewing after my boy went to sleep.  I thought it would be a nice light hearted alternative to the heavy depressing titles that I am interested in (Zero Dark Thirty, Lincoln, Rust and Bone).  I lost interest in the story pretty quickly and I found the Soundtrack and product placement peppered through out to be annoying.  I enjoy watching a good animated Children's film (Up, Toy Story, Despicable Me Kung Fu Panda), but this one wasn't for me.  I would agree with other viewers who thought that the inclusion of the characters from a first person shooter game seemed inappropriate for a film targeted at preschool and elementary age children.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Enjoy the maps with the satellite precipitation views.  also I can list numerous areas to view for a travel guide.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome... I enjoy the rush you get when playing. It would be more awesome if you could get directions on how to play more
B008JFUNAU|3.0|This really is a kids movie.... not so much geared toward the nostalgic adult though it did have a pretty good storyline, and plenty of tale charm.  I think the appeal in theme here is Oz being someone defeating the odds, overcoming substantial villains and winning the hearts of practically everyone without having any 'wizardly' powers whatsoever, in fact being just a plain ordinary person like you or I.  And of course, showing a lot of ordinary people how they can achieve perhaps extraordinary goals despite their weaknesses, etc.<br /><br />Michelle Williams I thought was perfect for her role (Glinda the Good) and really hit the mark, Rachel Weisz also played a strong part as \\"Evanora\\"..... however I felt like Mila Kunis was just too young, sounded like a high schooler (and that level of acting really).  She dropped even further as she became the black hatted Wicked Witch of the (West?) and began to rant more like a bratty teenager yelling at her boyfriend or dad.  James Franco of course being the young Oz, was pretty good but also a bit too immature for my liking and between the two they sort of leant an air of a Disney kid tv series.<br /><br />There was a bit of confusion as to who was which witch, especially with there only being three and really this was a pretty major part of the whole Wizard of Oz tale they for some reason didn't choose to play out accurately.  I mean we were looking to connect the dots after all North, South, East West to the 'sequel' but they just didn't add up.<br />Nevertheless, the story kept you watching and the ending was good.  Whoever did the opening credits deserves some credit also, pretty exceptional work.  They almost set the bar too high.<br /><br />I'm tempted to sum up the movie as \\"watch three hot babes fight over guy smiley while a CGI rendered monkey and a dwarf provide comic relief\\", but it deserves better than that, its a movie worth seeing and some people, depending on your taste may like it a lot.<br />But you can't help but wonder if they had recast a couple people, if just maybe this good film could have been a great one.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|talk about heavy duty and sharp! this thing will shave the hair right off your arm straight from the box. i can't wait to get out camping and really put it to use.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I've seen the DVD before and was thoroughly entertained, but the blu-ray version is unbelievable.  The picture and sound quality are superb, The bright, vivid colors and clean, crisp sound are literally, &#34;music to my ears&#34;.  The concert is an extraordinary event and is perfection in every sense.  Not only does the band cover their best known hits from every point of their distinguished career, but they cover an amazing assortment of solo work from Don, Glen and Joe.  As Don Henley puts it, &#34;our solo work is all Eagles music anyways&#34;.  But what makes this concert work for me, is the fact that it is quite obvious to see how much fun they were having doing what they do best.  Whether it was playing a classic hit or newer solo material, they are having a great time performing together.  Hours of excellent music, vocals and camera work are non stop on this disc.  I play this blu-ray at LEAST once a week and enjoy the experience more each time.
B00BF11STU|5.0|It's thriller masked as an artsy movie. It stays apolitical but gives us the true picture. Makes sense to watch this than those stupid G.I Joe movies.
630463949X|4.0|A concert that displays all the vast talents that Fleetwood Mac possess.  Lindsey Buckingham is, in my opinion, one of the top three guitar players on the planet. His work on &#34;Big Love&#34; is so amazing, I find it hard to believe the music is coming from only one guitar. Stevie and Christine have lost absolutely nothing as far as their vocal abilities.  Their singing is as smooth and capturing as ever.  And as for Mick's drum playing, well let's just say the video speaks for itself.  This man beats the heck out of those skins and shows the fun and enthusiasm he is having while doing it.  John stays in the background and provides the pulsating bass that the music is renowned for.  An enjoyable performance from every aspect.  My one complaint is that this is not a blu-ray and the picture is a bit blurry and distracting at times.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Seems like the end could have given us more character insight after building so well til the twist of  plot.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I was very unfamiliar with lady Gaga's music until this album arrived.  But hearing samples of the tracts on facebook, while playing Farmville, made me a fan.  I was blown away with the range and quality of her voice, the total polished, professional sound of her music.  While I can't claim to be a big fan of some of the lyrics, I would listen to her sing anything.  This recording shows such dynamic range.  While she presents herself as a visual performer. her musical abilities and talents are quite remarkable.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|Having translated the Robert Ludlum's book on Jason Bourne into a successful trilogy---there didn't seem to be much left to do but screenwriter/director Tony Gilroy (Michael Clayton) who had helped scripted the series was recruited to create a new hero or anti-hero for Universal. The result according to some critics has been mixed but to me, this one new addition is every bit as exciting and involving as the previous films plus it has a good action hero in Jeremy Renner who in a sense reminds me of a modern day James Cagney (they're both Irish). With excellent support from Rachel Weisz and a great supporting cast which includes Stacy Keach, Edward Norton, Albert Finney and a returning Joan Allen from \\"Ultimatum\\"--this is a worthy successor in the Bourne legacy.
6305428050|5.0|This was a great purchase.  I love this movie and it is so funny. Elisabeth Shue is great in it.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|This is not a romantic comedy, but it is a couples comedy nonetheless and good to watch with your significant other. I think that people who have been and are married will be able to appreciate the movie more than any other category of viewers. The language and scenes can be a little coarse in parts, in the usual Apatow style, however in general this was a great, funny movie. My husband and I really enjoyed it.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|It was slow in the beginning but I'm glad I kept reading it. Great narration from a 5 year old. Good book.
B00A3SGWYC|5.0|Awesome songs with great beats--perfect for a workout soundtrack.  The lyrics to some of the songs may be a little too strong for children/young adults/teenagers, but otherwise most of the songs have been released on the radio and are great for getting a good cadence going for your workout.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|A beautifully brilliant movie for the intelligent minded audience.  Daniel Day Lewis was absolutely amazing as well as his other cast mates.  I didn't see one weak performance.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and highly recommend it to anyone who needs something beyond mindless entertainment.
B003V5CFV8|4.0|I am an ESL teacher and my students are reading the Odyssey. I figured it would be something fun for them to watch. The girls enjoyed George Clooney but beyond that they bored quickly. Although, its a good movie, it doesnt have enough action to keep ESL students attention.<br /><br />I enjoyed it though.
0767817648|5.0|Great Movie to watch even though it is few years old. Action scenes were for it&#34;s time period. How about a sequel?
B0091TGWYE|2.0|Design is flawed. Having to remove it from the case to use it opens the possibility of dropping it, thereby defeating the object of the product.
1554072840|3.0|While I do appreciate the specific pointing out of body parts and the actual visualization of poop and pee I would like it if body parts were called by their actual names.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|One of my favorites! Well acted, sweet and funny. Leading and supporting actors are great! Glad I finally bought it!
B00846REIS|1.0|After reading Fifty Shades, reading this book is a waste of time. The characters and the overall structure, the flow of the book is very very similar to Fifty Shades.<br />I believe the publisher called Sylvia Day and said \\"please write a book, similar to Fifty Shades that would be on the best sellers list just like it\\". And that is why they use the name of Fifty Shades throughout all their promotional activities including the interviews with Sylvia Day.
B005EVVESM|5.0|the entire album has great songs that you can listen to at any time day or night on the road or off
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Easy to play. Not horribly addictive like some games.beautiful graphics on nexus 7. Has a cheat button if you get stuck. Overall I like it very much.
B007QDNKQA|4.0|Great action and heroic character in Wahlberg. If they shot my dog, I'd consider doing what he did.  Fortunately, I can tell the difference between fiction and reality. Still a great action thriller if you can suspend disbelief for a little while.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This was truly an amazing book!!  Not what I expected at all. I grew up watching the movie and to know that it had almost NOTHING to do with the book.<br />It is rather sad that the book and the movie are so very different. I guess it can be said the movie is based on the idea of the book, but the book is WAY different.<br />Mr Baum wrote so eloquently and so well that he paints a very lovely picture and the book is super easy to read. Recommend reading to anyone who likes classic literature.
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|This show is a sensational hit. I can't believe that I didn't watch this when it first aired. But I had missed several seasons when I first learned of the show and I did not want to begin watching in the middle of the show. You can't just start from the middle or you will most definately be LOST. Speaking of LOST, when I got into this show I got LOST in LOST (LOL). But it is true, I could not stop watching until I finished the entire series. This review applies to the other seasons as well. I have not yet been able to rate them. In my opinion, this is the best show ever made.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Excellent Alien blasting game with sense of humor and extra DIMENSION.  Also, funny MIDI music score.  Play it with the sound on.  Runs well on HTC Thunderbolt.  Highly recommended.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|This game is good to any age! My daughter loves seeing what animal will be next.  The glitter ones are he  favorite.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best and easiest game to play very addicting awesomely cool to play easy to hit jackpot use hover boards love this game
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I have just watched the DVD of Season Three of  Downton Abbey.  This was eagerly awaited and continues the high standard promised by Seasons 1 and 2.  I wouldn't spoil it for viewers who have not yet seen it by outlining any of the story.  Suffice to say that, much to my satisfaction, the ending implies that there is another Season to come.  I do hope I am right as it is one of the most engrossing serials I have ever watched.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It was a great app nothing was wrong with it is a good app for anyone who likes the movie
0143034901|4.0|One of the classic sentences in the book, towards the end, talks about the decline in the number of great readers in the world. This is so true. In the world of Twitter, WhatsApp, TV and what not, the art of reading is dying a slow death. And then comes along a great book like this one, and then there is hope.<br /><br />This is one of those great books that I read almost without a pause. The book shifts between Carax and the world of Daniel in almost seamless manner, two worlds that move together in what seem to be parallel lines, and then they merge. The stories of the 'past' and the 'present' merge into each other at the end of the book. Then, Carax goes back into the shadows of the wind, and the story of Daniel dwindles into the book shop. I would have liked to have seen him become the Keeper of The Cemetary, but what the hell! It does not matter.<br /><br />I love the style of the writing, and how he keeps it taut right through the book. The love story of Bea and Daniel has been woven into the book skillfully, and this fits right in as well.<br /><br />The story of Julian Carax is almost mystical, almost surreal. It seems to be like a mystery, and then suddenly he comes to life at the end of the book!<br /><br />Definitely, read the book. This will resurrect the dying art of reading.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great read for anybody! The characters, setting, and plot are all fantastic and have their own little complexities that make you keep reading! Howey has something new and unexpected for you in every chapter. Defiantly in my top 5 favorite books.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|The unique writing style lets us see Charlie and his friends go through life's awkward stages. It's a classic story that everyone should have in their library.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|It's ok but the only thing I find wrong with it is the controls it glitch from time to time but still an awesome game
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|It was very funny and intellectual at the same time! How often do you find that? She is totally unique.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book had me absolutely enthralled.  A very good read, which I would recommend highly.  It is really a Keeper
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|- like Kiefer a lot, was not familiar w/him until I started watching this series.<br />- like most of the regular characters...they add a lot to the action.<br />- don't like how his father behaves - doesn't deserve a son like Kiefer!<br />- great acting by all the characters!
B0079M8R6Q|5.0|Intriging insight into not only camp life, but the daily struggle for survival in North Korea. Very topical just now as the Govt has gone onto war footing which also comes out in the book, the paranoia that grips the country.
B00008O31H|4.0|One of those albums you can peacefully put on replay and fill an evening with. No surprises, no weird things, just good songs in a steady atmosphere.
B005BDZQKU|5.0|I saw the film in a first-run movie palace in NYC in 1961. (The early days of 70mm and multi-channel stereo sound.) Left an incredible memory on me that I revisited with this Blu-Ray set. A classic film in great quality with bonus DVD/CDs and memorabilia. Price is excellent (anniversary was two years ago, so it's discounted greatly). Love it!
B00004U8P4|5.0|When I finally received my package on time I was so happy. I've been waiting a long time to get this movie on collectors edition VHS.So there is complaints here
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game I always wanted a horse but never had money now I have a PONY&nbsp; this is my favorite game ever.
B00AHGSVKS|3.0|Has an Interesting plot. The story was not what I expected, but it kept me interested enough. Good book for the price.
B004NIFK9Q|3.0|I always finish a book but this one was so boring that even after a hundred pages I put it down for good.  Just could not get into it and I usually love these types of books.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Takes a little logic to get the answers on the first try, so I like that.  It's fun and easy to learn how to play.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Great and lightweight, exactly as I expected. Keeps my kindle protected, especially when being used by the little ones. Must have!
B004SEUJBE|5.0|I loved this movie for years. So when I went to buy it and saw such a great price. I was very pleased. They had very gassy delivery too.
B004R63MWQ|4.0|pretty good. enjoyed it but not as well as first one. grand kids liked it more than the wife and I.
B00BTHV05M|5.0|I have loved both of OneRepublic's earlier albums and when an artist has a new CD I never know if it'll live up to the last. This surpasses it.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|I downloaded this for a family occasion... no one was particularly interested in watching it with me until it began... we were all mesmerized. Captivating story and well executed documentary.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|This game was not at all challenging and I was quickly bored playing it. I was disappointed and will not recommend.
B0099114WO|5.0|Great movie. Had trouble locating it in the stores, especially at this price. A movie I can identify with and can see myself in a few years.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|This game is easy I bought it at about 8:30 and I just got on metallic madness (the final level I think) but that's why it is 1 buck. The only problem is the memory storage. I had to delete some apps (the free ones) to install. It was worth it!!!!!!!
B00BSBY38A|5.0|I was skeptical of this movie and never saw it in the theater.  Should not have tried to out-guess Ang Lee and his magical touch.  This is an engrossing story.  There is a twist when things wind up in the end.  One I was not expecting.  Beautifully shot.  A feast for the eyes.  Highly recommended. A story of survival of the body and the soul.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great way to relive history, to finally understand what actually took place, a very good, suspenseful movie. Great guy or girl flick.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|It has its pros and cons. A girl on the run to find her love... and also the Rising, a rebellion against the government. Trust and survival. It is the usual dystopian romance with a powerful government... however it has a little bit of a twist. It would be a good read for most readers who enjoy a good dystopian romance.
B009FZFONO|5.0|i love this show. no, I am obsessed with this show. It's like watching a high quality movie almost every time I see it. It just keeps getting better and better. The decisions to kill off main characters keeps me on the edge of my seat every episode. It's so suspenseful, I actually had a panic attack last season. If you don't mind gore, and intelligence, watch it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Great game love the brain challenge and how addicting the game is can play this game for hours and not get bored with it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was such an inspiring book of hope for all that have been sexally abused by someone in their lives. To find someone that has been missing for over 13 years and finding love through all of it, Made you feel you were one with the book. Cant wait to read more of her books.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the best game and it has nice features it is just so fun I play this so many times a day I love it
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Justin Hayward is one of the great singer/songwriters of this era. This album is a wonderful collection of haunting and beautiful songs, in the vein of The Moody Blues.
B00319ECGU|5.0|Some movies just don't get old. You don't realize how many great movie quotes there are by Harry until you watch them again.
1452110581|5.0|I highly recommend this brilliant book. It is poignant, hilariously funny, and also extremely touching; a rare combination in any genre. For a cat lover, it is a must have!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|My daughters grew up with Harry. I had to get my own copies so I could continue to watch them again (and again)
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I love the setting, I love the chracters, I love the motorcycles and mosts of all I love the life style
B006LSZECO|4.0|Many friends recommended this as a must read couldn't put it down book. The writing is very good. The characters are not very nice people. I felt the ending was rushed. Glad I read it but its not all that!
1579128955|5.0|He loves this book and is using it for a 5th grade research paper. He likes just looking at it, and regularly asks me to sit and read it together with him.
B00BHMF578|4.0|I had heard so much before seeing the movie I'm afraid it couldn't have lived up to the hype.  With that said I thought it was well done.
0061537969|5.0|I cried and cried, but ultimately the ending is up-lifting.  I bought copies for friends and family, they all loved it, too.
B00BL5EQLC|3.0|In this game you run through a level swiping up to jump, and again to double jump, down to run under low objects, hit the center of the screen to jump off walls and so on in an effort to collect silver glowing objects and deliver them to a customer at the end of the level. One error means death and a start over. Basically a side scrolling TEMPLE RUN with levels.<br /><br />It's not poorly made and the permissions are acceptable, I'm just tired of the same games repackaged again and again. There are a ton of running games out there and I'm not sure that this game stands out. So it gets an OK three stars from me. I'll let my kids play it. The younger kids that don't expect too much.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The only problem is the constant repeating of him wearing a condom!!! We get it!!!  No woman wants exes thrown in their faces! The heart of the story is good!
B004LWZW7E|5.0|I disagree with the negative reviews criticising acting and the story going down hill at a certain point. I love this movie I feel it is very well written and even has a meaning, To me I feel like this movie is just like our world but slightly more futuristic and instead of paper money...time. Like when someone says &#34;In order for a few to be immortal, many must die&#34; this is like in our world, if a few are to be extremely rich, many must be poor.<br />its not all action, but there is enough for me and I am pretty easily board if there is a lack of action like say; Zero Dark Thirty...I got so board.<br />I sincerely really like this movie it has a great story, meanings, and decent acting.
B007N8RULO|1.0|Did not like playing with only one color of cards. I like all of the deck colors in front of me.
B007X4ECLY|2.0|Basically I bought it because I thought a modern action movie is always good and the people complaining about it were just being critics, well I was wrong. It was so bad, now i'm not one to complain about a bad story but it was terrible, and the jokes were not the only thing that was cheap, in the beginning there was a car chase seen were this car flips and it was all animated, badly, like I play racing games with better animations. Its been a long time since I have ignored bad reviews and bought a movie anyway and it really did turn out to be that bad, but here I am. Not all movies with bad reviews are bad, but this one is a solid 2/5.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. It is a very interesting and entertaining story and although the characters are not particularly likeable, they are so well developed that the choices they end up making are so &#34;like them&#34; that it is different to imagine a different outcome. I guess that is what I like most of this author, her ability to portray these dysfunctional psychopathic characters with so much depth that the way the plot unfolds only seems natural.<br />In the case of DARK SPACES, even though Libby is a very flawed and disturbed woman I was surprised at her blunt honesty about herself. She knows and acknowledges she is a thief, manipulative, greedy, unempathic woman, but has no interest in pretending otherwise.<br />This is the third book I've read by this author and enjoyed it very much, just as I did with Gone Girl and Sharp Objects.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Was recommended by a friend of my 10 year old son now I can't stop playing it.  It challenges me while still playing a different version of a game I have played for years.
B008X6JP3G|3.0|This was a good story movie, expected a better ending especially if revenge is the Title. Wasn't clear on the sequence of events at the end.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Love his album, different styles of music on this album. Such a great and talented artist and the price is reasonable.
1451695195|5.0|So far, this book is very insightful, haven't finished it yet. I have always had an interest in the afterlife
B00AREIAI8|5.0|omg this game is awesome. I'm hooked! I just cant stop playing this game. its just so addictive! wow!  agree?
B005LAIISA|5.0|Got it as a gift for my nephew and he loves it.  He is a fan of all Ice Age movies
B0010AN7Z4|5.0|Perfect match-up with Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine.  Fred MacMurray played the scumbag CEO to a tee.  Have watched it many times.  It never loses its appeal.
B00BSBXZDY|3.0|Your movies are skipping now. Good movie though. I just wish I would have rented through play station network.please fix this problem .
B000BNX3B4|4.0|Diane Lane and John Cusack are a delightful mix.  A definite feel good movie.  Nice to watch if you are feeling down.
B0067R0APK|5.0|Very cool weather app.Easy to navigate and fun to use. I give it 5 stars I give it more if I could.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Downton Abbey you will love this show.  The cast was great. I wish I could have lived in that time period. I really enjoyed the show.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|You know what you're getting with Follett, and you're never disappointed. If it weren't for the gratuitous sex, I could recommend him to all of my friends.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|This movie was so boring I shut it off less than half way through. Unless you're a fan of tales about weird cults and con men and the screwed up people they attract don't bother with this.
B001IF277K|4.0|It makes the phone alive again. The old battery wouldn't last for more than an hour. Much cheaper alternative than a new phone!
B00BLGZDYA|2.0|This movie was so bad I don't even remember what it was about because I shut it off after the first fifteen minutes
B008Y5OW20|4.0|glad to know the the former founder of ELO is still recording great music....Keep the music coming Jeff Lynne! Rock on!!!
B00B9366VO|5.0|If you grew up listening to the music of the 60s than this is a must see. A historical perspective on one of the most famous recording studios of the time it answers a lot of questions about musical groups you knew and loved and how they came to record the music that shaped your life.
B006OB3K56|5.0|I love the movie, I love the purchase, and I love the condition of the package; perfect condition just like from the leader movie stores. Very happy with the decision. I would reccommend this movie and this seller to my friends and family. Thank you so much for the quality and the promise.
0399213015|3.0|When they say miniature they mean it. The size of my hand with tiny writing. Not really small child friendly.
B002XUL6RG|4.0|I love this movie itself and have wanted it to begin with, but &#34;the product&#34; toward this purchase I'm giving 4 stars. The reason I didn't give 5 stars for because I kept my eyes on this item and checking the price for a year the price kept the same or little higher, but as soon as I purchased the price keeps droping the next day, and the next day, and the next day after that. :( My luck wasn't so good, was it? The delivery is also 3 days later than it was promised, I tried the Prime trial. It was dissapointing.  Overall I love the movie, it's a great movie.
B0074VA2T2|4.0|My daughter loves this app and i do too. My only reason for giving it four stars is because it freezes a lot when she plays it.
B006PTL1QM|5.0|I love the movie and I love the product. Great condition as said. I'm very happy with this purchase although the price now is dropped quite a bit but the movie is worth the price I got. Anyone who is looking for this product go ahead and purchase from this seller. It's a great price with great conditions. I will purchase again and will recommend to family and friends.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are definitely worth the read. I thoroughly enjoyed reading these books, and am glad I made the decision to buy them!
B00A757EFW|3.0|I have use to play this  in the machine .just wanted to see if I could still play and have fun.
B00270WH3Y|5.0|Paul Simon is a prolific songwriter, and I love his solo endeavors, but Simon & Garfunkel had great harmony, and the lyrics were in touch with the changing scene of the 60s.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|Well just wanted to try it and see what it was but I really do not like it like I thought it was.
0345528581|5.0|Being nearly done with P90X i had bought this book read through it could not put it down its full great info and to me its a very Valuable book to<br />have for any one especially any one who has completed P90x i see more challenging then P90x yet easy at the same time.<br />I also getting the you are your own DVD set also.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|They say all good things must come to an end and I am not looking forward to this series end.  The story line is engaging.  The settings and costumes are delicious.  The acting is amazing.  I wish we could follow this family right up to the present day.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|love it loads of fun...its a must try for all age's.  easy to learn my kids enjoy it! we just started playing on kindle fire..would like to know if it has different boards?
0545101417|4.0|Another great read.  The audio version of this series really captures the spirit of the books -- the narration is a perfect fit.  The only note on this one is that you should expect to dive right into book three.  There is a cliff-hanger ending that needs resolution.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I've never had a problem with this game. Great time waster and use it whenever I'm bored. It makes you think harder as the levels go and I would recommend this game to any of my friends
B008OJ291W|4.0|Jeff did a good job re-recording some of the old ELO standards, but why did he feel the need to? It would have been nicer to have a new ELO album, or even a new solo Jeff album.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|It's a bit slow to start.  It reminds me a lot of the Facebook games which I lost interest in rather quickly.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The book was exciting and I stayed interested throughout. There were a couple of little twists that I enjoyed and a very satisfying end. I do like for books to end my way and Mr. Flynn keeps me happy. I recommend.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I was playing this today, and I couldn't stop playing because it was so addicting! You should rely get this app it's fun, cool, and free.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Simple, yet unique and enjoyable space invader-like game. Easy to use controls. Something to play when you want to burn a few minutes waiting in line.
B00280LYIC|5.0|The Percy Jackson and the Olympians series begins!<br />Join Percy on his quest to save the world from World War 3.<br />His fellow demigod Annabeth and Grover the satyr on a magical journey to retrieve a godly weapon worthy of Zeus and to save his mother from the evil clutches of Hades.<br />Deserves every star!
B00B1E6FF8|2.0|I would have to say that i was looking forward to watching this movie for a long time. But when it actually came time to open and actually watch it ,i found it very boring! That being said i am a veteran and applaud what the seals did and do everyday to keep the world a safer place.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It wasn't as great as some people say it is. I got bored way too quick. But to each their own!
B000MRAAJM|2.0|I purchased this for my wife and I to enjoy and perhaps share with our children and grandchildren. We soon discovered that every episode has at least one or two 10-15 minutes  sequences where a predator chases, catches, kills and eats its prey in 1080p bloody high definition. I was conned into buying this thinking that it was only about the beauty of our planet. We watched about 4 episodes and that was enough blood and gore for us. There is no way that this is suitable for children. The nature scenes are breathtaking, but the gore spoils what should have been a celebration of the beauty of our planet.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I liked this book from the beginning, but it got better and better until the very end. Several developments were a complete surprise, but fit perfectly once revealed.
0061733199|5.0|Has a lot of useful information in it and will make for a good reference book.  I like to just flip through it until I see something interesting and then review just that section.
0385349947|5.0|My biggest takeaway from this book is that Sheryl Sandberg is everywoman. She has the same struggles, worries, and concerns that we all have. She isn't some other species who somehow magically became a success through no effort of her own. What she does have is the fact that she's smart, she works hard, and she takes the risks she needs to take in order to achieve.
B00280LYIC|4.0|Really great for the kindle because you can find the definition of Greek terms quickly, I really enjoyed reading it, good fantasy story
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Downton Abbey is the best of TV!  We are addicted to the series, it is well written, suspenseful innovative and the acting is superb!  Don't miss this third season.  The packing was perfect and it arrived in a timely manner!
B009LDXQGW|4.0|Loved the hole CD you get three of them. I never herd of them but it was worth the try
B00B1EEKM8|4.0|This is a movie I especially wanted on Blu Ray because of the picture and sound. I waited for the individual titles to be released instead of paying for the 3-movie pack since the 2nd and 3rd movies are terrible. The Blu-Ray version does not disappoint in terms of the picture and sound - both are excellent.  The video is vivid, with beautiful colors and details. The audio is maybe a little bit less excellent because the dialog is too low in a few places. Given the age of the film, however (doesn't seem like it was that long ago but I guess it was), it is very good. The surround effects put you right in the middle of the action and the low frequencies will shake your house if you have a decent subwoofer.<br /><br />The story itself - nowhere near as good as Michael Crichton's book but then you can't expect it to be. The book was much more detailed. I did find that parts of the story were implausible. Yes, I know a dinosaur park is implausible to begin with, but what I meant were some of the things that happened in the story did not seem very realistic in common sense terms (such as the appalling lack of security for the park). I know the idea is to tell an exciting story so I figure they have to have things that don't really make sense.<br /><br />Also.. I had forgotten just how annoying those two kids were, especially the girl. I found myself wishing the dinosaurs would eat them both.  I had to laugh at how villainous Newman was in this movie. I don't remember his real name but he'll always be Newman to me. He might as well have been Newman here, too.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|this app works smoothly.  I enjoy shopping on ebay and this app keeps me in touch when i am away from my computer.  this app was downloaded to kindle.  thank you.
B008UG0IS0|5.0|This is another winner from this incredible pianist. The other two members of her trio are excellent as well. I just sit there enjoying the music and marveling at the very, very high level of musicianship. They play well together, the compositions are original, imaginative and never boring, and I just have to smile at how good they are. The recording is engineered exceptionally well, too. This trio really has their act together.
B000FA675C|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book to others.  It kept my interest, is a good novel.  I also saw the movie but enjoyed the book more.
B004LWZWC4|5.0|Yes it is way, way better than most any recent comedy. It's well written story. The acting is great. Nature is great. The birds are beautiful. Nifty classic objects... like an airplane. Nice music. It works. It would work for children. Well directed and edited. I did not expect it. I loved it. Saw it in pristine HD on Cinemax.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a fun and exciting game and it is super addicting. The first time I played it, it was for about 45 minutes... haha.... I recommend this game for the plane,car,or around the house to everyone out there!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|. There is more than one intimate view of the men who fought the slave trade that threatened to split the country.The lives of the men who stood with Lincoln become real in this engrossing story of slavery and its effects on the history of our country.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|I have to admit there was not a lot new  in this particular plot, but the &#34;Reacher style&#34; was very much continued.<br /><br />Easy reading & finished just a little too quickly for my liking.  Overall OK.  Would not put me off buying the next one.<br /><br />Happy days<br />PJ.
B0086HGW42|4.0|Ed Sheeran is great in this album. I love all the songs. They're all so mellow and laidback and just so pretty-sounding. (Sighs) It makes me think of a lazy summer afternoon when I hear these songs, with the sun out, kids playing, wind blowing the trees, birds chirping....This album is fantastic! My favorite songs are Small Bump, Wake Me Up, and Give Me Love. Keep going Ed! You're doing great!
B00BF11STU|4.0|Started out a little slower than I anticipated but we ended up really enjoying the movie, and would definatly watch it again
B00000DGUG|5.0|This is the PERFECT album! I can't get enough of Alanis Morissette! Now I'm only 18 so I was around 4 yrs when this album came out. I'm glad I discovered it now when my musical tastes have evolved to more mature eclectic type music, music that has an acquired taste. Stars like Alanis Morissette, Regina Spektor, Fiona Apple, Glen Hansard, James Morrison and Citizen Cope are the real deal! This is music! All the songs on this album are fantastic. When I first heard Front Row, I didn't like it, but after forcing myself to not skip over it and listen to it more and more, it's become one of my favorite songs on the album; I even memorized the lyrics in less than 30 minutes. It's a fantastic song. I also LOOOOOOOOVVVVEEEE Sympathetic Character, Baba, Thank U, well...all of them really. I just can't wait to get more of Alanis' music! She's become my favorite artist! Love her!
B00000E2QI|4.0|Love the music, but volume too low at times.  When turned up, suddenly blasts too loud other times. Well done otherwise, just keep near the volume control.  Musicianship is superb.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|This was a very interesting book for my 5th grader to read and do a report on. We enjoyed reading it together.
B0087YP862|3.0|Pires' playing is very nice indeed, full of singing line and spirituality. Abbado and his Orchestra Mozart are not in par with Pires unfortunately. They adopt a \\"period\\" style playing in the strings section, which is fine, but the result is a very cold and emotionally detached sound, that doesn't work well with Pires'. Pires' other performances of k.466 are better, especially the one with the Berlin Philharmonic under Boulez ([[ASIN:B005LL4TZ0 Europa Konzert from Lisbon]]). The recording quality is good, if not exceptional.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|I love this app but it does get boring after awhile. It's addicting trying to kill the whole world but like slot of apps, it gets boring.
B00BEZTMQ8|2.0|Jackson should have made this film (and not tried to stretch it out into three films) before he tackled The Lord of the Rings trilogy.  The Hobbit is inferior in every way to that trilogy.  This one suffers from terrible pacing issues because the story is being stretched out way too much (like butter scraped over too much bread is a perfect analogy for it).  Jackson can't decide on a tone - it's light-hearted and silly (like the book) in places, but then he tries to make it dark and very serious in other places which is a big mistake, IMO.  He should have just stuck with the overall tone of the book and made a PG movie for kids.  That's what this material is - a light, silly story for kids.  Jackson and the studio executives really ruined this property by trying to make it appeal to everyone and stretching the story over a three movie arc, which may be the most blatant attempt to milk a story for every cent possible in the history of cinema.<br /><br />The CGI is embarrassingly bad in many places.  It takes you completely out of the film.  If LotR was a labor of love, this was pass the baton to the vfx houses and hope they make it look decent.  They didn't.<br /><br />The whole thing is a giant bore because I felt like I'd seen the whole thing before except executed much better (which I did).  I'll be skipping the 2nd and 3rd installment.  These people have too much of my money already.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|If I could give this movie ten stars, then I would. I LOVE Pitch Perfect. It is NOT like Glee and that is a common misconception that turns alot of people away.
B00000IQV7|5.0|Arrived quickly - would recommend this company - do not like that I have to type in so many words.
B006LSZECO|3.0|the book gone girl was okay.  there was nothing surprising about the story.  I like more mystery to my reading.<br /><br />it did not keep my interest .
1609611543|5.0|Arrived quickly - would recommend this company - do not like that I have to type in so many words.
B005LAII8K|4.0|Interesting plot And great performances by all. Thoroughly enjoyable, have watched it several times, amazing vision of the future which I think may be very realistic.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|You can't help but see Beckett & Castle in this story. I hope they're all this good. Now off to read book 2!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is addictive! I didn't think I would like it but its easy to get hooked! I really enjoy playing it!
B006C1DH92|1.0|not a good game.. I keep having problems playing it with my cell phone samsung admired...<br />never will buy games.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I just want to see the last episode.  It disappeared before I could watch it!!!  What can I do?????  Any thoughts?
B007EECSFA|4.0|this book comes in a close second.  Enjoyed the back and forth between the past and the present.  The twist at the very end was surprising!
B00992CF6W|3.0|ever since I started trying to make paintball stadiums with my brothers everything has gone wrong. if I accidentally exit the game on multiplayer mode they get disconnected and lose whatever they had. iron armour swords bows and huge amount of arrows have been lost. the worst thing happened today. my kindle crashed and when I went back on (this had happened before and it wasn't a big deal) everything was gone. my accounts we still there but the buildings and chests were gone. I only had what I had been carrying when I had last quit the game. a huge crushing blow. no more paintball stadiums mines and houses and caves. all gone.my 20 or so accounts were still there but it was as if I had just spawned there for the first time. love this game, but I really don't like these 2 faults that have happened. wow
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Lol love it!!!!!!¡ but I wish the prizes would go gown a little bit so I can get the robot dude lolz
B0027MJU00|4.0|This was a one nighter and if this is the writing style of this author, I'm surely drawn in, in a macabre sort of way to have to finish it all! I figured out the ending before I got to the twist, but I could still finish with enjoyment. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes this genre of books. I really enjoyed it. Is that wrong based upon the content?
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Perfect for a younger audience.  Felt a bit old reading this.  Still<br />Interesting.  Actions of one, can affect so many
B001EO2UJK|5.0|Big box-set with your all time favorites albums from Trespass to The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. Nick Davies put all the tricks by creating some 5.1 surround remixes, where you can hear the sound coming from Hackett ,rubbing his guitar's strings like he was just near your ear. The sound is clear and loud and offer a nice separation from the front and the rear speakers, the latter is use a lot for the keyboards and some special guitars parts. I didn't find that it was lacking dynamics or the warm feeling of the originals stereo mixes, but i am sure i have heard new sounds that i can't remember hearing on vinyl or remasters cd's. The mixes of The Lamb Lies down on Broadway are accompanied with some nice slide show; videos with concert footage, pictures and animations. Very cool!<br /><br />I have seen most of the extras videos, concert footage, that are in terms of quality, what you supposed to get in the 70's, so there was any surprise here, but glad to have it in one box-set, the extra cd of rare tracks is a nice addition. There is also some 2007 interviews of each member who talk about the production of each cd.<br /><br />If you appreciate the surround experience of the 5.1 mixes, buy this, if not, i would think it twice before buying this expensive box-set. Probably the only box-set i will buy ever, because this is on top of my 5 favorites albums.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|There is no historical evidence, not a shred, that Lincoln backed or had anything at all to do with the passing of the 13th amendment. Prior to the war, he did back what would have been the 13th had it passed, and would have enshrined slavery in the Constitution. This movie is an historical fraud. I still gave it 3 stars, because it represents Lincoln as I would have wanted him to be.
B002RT69QQ|3.0|I purchase this for my photo album frame, but I don't use it anymore.  I haven't tried it on my computer yet.
B000TENK4K|5.0|I really liked this Daft Punk album because of its lack of human emotion. The tracks are very electronic and kind of robotic. Very different than Discovery. Some of my favorite tracks are Prime Time of Your Life, Make Love, Robot Rock, and Emotion. The whole album is amazing!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Awesome game. Love the effercts. My daughter enjoys playing the game as well. Wished you could advance quicker within the game.
B00BDPW7XE|5.0|In spite of the obvious, all comparisons to Genesis or any of those guys from that era should end here. What's obvious is that from the first song on \\"English Electric Pt. 2\\",  this is a singular band by virtue of the rich and diverse instrumentation Big Big Train employs. The simple fact is that all great art draws on what has come before and seeks to advance on and transcend what has come before. Big Big Train does this in so many ways that continued comparisons are just redundant. It would be very easy for this band to flaunt an icy sound, but their use of string and brass sections lend an organic and accessible warmth even to some of their more complex arrangements, like \\"East Coast Racer\\", a dynamic extended piece (15 min. plus) that builds into sheer grandeur with voice mellotrons and bass pedals, and some machine-gun funk drumming from Nick D'Virgilio. These string and brass sections are integrated into a lot of the songs, either in a soothing way, or providing rich accent and sound texture to the virtuostic playing of the now six official band members in songs like \\"Swan Hunter\\". \\"The Permanent Way\\", a loving ode to farmers and miners, also contains very effective vintage spoken word passages that render it a bittersweet tale of a vanishing way of life. \\"Leopards\\" grooves with a sweet Western swing with lovely voice melody and fiddle, and almost Beach Boy - like vocal passages. Brilliant. \\"Keeper of Abbeys\\" begins as a deceptively simple rock song then morphs into this exciting modern reel with wild violin playing from Rachel Hall and Dave Gregory's electric sitar. This whole album is filled with exciting musical passages, you hear more with each listen. If you are immersed in the lyricism that informs this music, on multi-instrumentalist and writer Greg Spawton's \\"Worked Out\\" (another tale about coal miner's of yore), when singer David Longdon sings the line \\"we had our day, our day is over\\", you're invested in the story. He makes such smart use of his vocal range on this song and the hooks are irresistable. It goes from soft storytelling then does a 180 to it's backbeat driven chorus. If there were such a thing as FM radio today in the form it used to exist, this would, and may yet be their breakout song.  Longdon and Spawton are credited with the writing, but with players of this caliber and imagination, surely there are contributions from all involved. This isn't just \\"Progressive Rock\\", but very accessible stuff for fans of the genre, or anyone interested in music that's more than just disposable ear candy. \\"English Electric Pt. 2\\" is a logical and successful follow-up to \\"Pt. 1\\", and shows a tight knit band poised to break big big big.
6305841861|3.0|I liked Evil Dead part one better.This one was kind of silly...Kind of stupid...and I dont think I would watch it again
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|gave it 5 stars because its worth it. now we have all 3 movies. this movie is great for all aged kids.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season is a lot darker then previous ones. Keeping the show fresh by killing off veteran characters and bring new ones keeps people on their toes, no one is safe on this show.
B0091LS07E|3.0|I love Alicia Keys and her music. After hearing the song &#34;Girl On Fire,&#34; I decided to buy the buy DVD.  However, I was really disappointed to  receive this version with Nicki Minaj singing with Keys. It really ruined the song for me.

B005CRQ2DK|5.0|U should have this book. It's so cool to have this book I think that you like this book cool. I have read that book Many times. It is so funny!!!!  It is a great book.
B00BF123WG|3.0|I was expecting more an action film than a Thriller. The action scene is to short for my taste.I still prefer Act of Valor for its more realistic action
B0084AZXKK|4.0|The book starts off at a slow pace, but soon brings you into a story of great adventure and rebellion, showing the darkness and greed of men, as well as loyalty.
B001NLL93W|5.0|So far my favorite! I love to live in the world of shadowhunters. This book kept me on the edge of my seat, I could not put it down.

B0094BB4TW|3.0|My biggest dislike is the chat feature which always seems slow on response. My like is the reliability of the site.
B000NY12LO|5.0|jodi is one of the best authors that i have read. everyone should give her novels a try. loved this book
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|Well with 396 reviews here already, as I post this, (many from the theatrical release), I'm certainly not the first but I hope I can add a few helpful comments about the DVD version of the film.<br />First off, I will say that I liked the film a lot. No, not the graphic violence, but that can't be helped with a story on the subject that this film is all about. But it did fill in the story during the 10 year period from 9/11/2011 until 2011 when Osama bin Laden was found and killed.<br />Usually the Bluray is the only version with extra bonus features. But this time the DVD contains about 25 minutes worth. There is neither Director's commentary nor even the film's \\"trailer\\" but here are the four \\"bonuses:<br />No small feat - the \\"making of\\" featurette narrated mostly by Director Kathryn Bigelow. But it's waaaaay too short at just 3:52.<br /><br />The Compound - this 9-minute featurette focuses on the bin Laden compound where he was discovered and where the final 30 minutes of the 2 ½-hour film takes place. The replicated set was built in Jordan in three weeks and Producer/Screenwriter Mark Boal takes the viewer on a guided tour of the set. This is well worth seeing<br /><br />Geared Up - is a 7-minute featurette that shows how the actors were trained by Navy Seals in the mission and reveals that some of the crew in those final scenes were actual  former serviceman.<br /><br />Targeting Jessica Chastain - is the weakest feature. It's 5 minutes of the cast talking about how good an actress Chastain is in the role of Maya.<br /><br />What's missing here - besides a longer \\"making of\\" feature is the story behind the real life Maya character - the young CIA agent who set out to find bin Laden and capture him - dead or alive.<br />This is not a film to watch before you go to bed - there are too many strong images. But I'm glad I watched it.<br />I hope this review is both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|this app is fun and also hard at the same time also,it is a bit hard to earn coins. I gave this 4 stars
B001GUXJQA|5.0|Always on your toes, this author has it together<br />Have read almost everything he has written so far and will keep looking
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Graphics are truly at best. The amount of memory required is no problem on my kindle fire. Fun and always something to do. There is plenty of twists and turns in the story to always keep you on your toes. I recommend to ages 10+. It does have cursing and derogatory influences. Other than that it's an excellent game.
B00466HN6S|5.0|It's fine! Just what you would expect if you walked into Best Buy or Walmart to purchase a new DVD. Works just fine.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This game is worth it super fun and good at passing the time!!! Play as three different hero's and take back the princess from the evil undead demons!!! A lot better than number one!!!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I just enjoyed this story so much. I honestly started it and finished it the same day. It was well written with some parts where I am saying or shouting in my head\\"get it together you know you are perfect for each other\\" Loved, loved, loved it.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I like this game I will give it a 5<br />And I also like it because all of my characters are  upgraded
B006KX3GXO|5.0|this I would recomend to anyone its not hard to use its really effective its like the simpler version of photoshop I wouldn't say it is exactly the same but its a really good app to get I love it its Awesome ----that all you need to know so go and download it.

B00BFHZOCG|4.0|the boys from NY really show their respect for the great bands who influenced them over the years. even though these tracks stay true to the originals, Anthrax certainly puts their stamp on each one with amazing musicianship. all tracks truly capture the essence, tones and energy of Anthrax at their best.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I originally purchased this app for my iPhone, after I learned that gReader was not available on iOS.  I like the cover story interface, as well as the ease of loading in my RSS feeds.  Highly recommend.

B007HACDLK|5.0|I took a departure from my normal murder mystery genre due to a friends recommendation. I was pleasantly entertained and will now add at least this author to my reading list.  I usually use reading as a sleeping aid and this book didn't work very well in that regard, due to my wish to keep reading.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Great book.. a bit tough to comprehend at first. But has great meaning. Would recommend anyone to read this book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I honestly like the second one better than the first one.That is because the obsticle is much much bigger.And you can buy more powerups and its more alive.Like the first one the backround looked fake but then the second one is more realistic like the waterfall looks real and  the cave looks so real to.
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|If you love Tarantino movies and spagetti western soundtracks, you will love this one. Freedom and the Django theme are probably my 2 favorite but I find it all a good listen
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|I Love it!  It's the best show ever! Very entertaining. Shows the life of the Upper class as well as the servants.  Love the way it brings in history.  The costumes are incredible.  I own all 3 seasons and can't wait till the 4th.
B0015DROBO|4.0|This was an interesting book about a mystery from decades ago.  There was not a lot of action throughout most of it, although there are a couple of scenes that involve some rather graphic and twisted violence (as well as a lot of reference to other violent acts).  Since it was set in Sweden I had a little bit harder time keeping the places and people straight because too many sounded alike to me (who is Birger vs. Berger, for example).  I actually had to keep notes and draw a sketch of the family tree - which, thankfully, was provided.  That being said, I still enjoyed the book well enough and would recommend reading it.  I then saw the movie, which cut out enough that I ended up filling in my husband on some details - and somewhat different ending - that I thought were fairly important.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This is probably the best game I have played for $40. Well worth $40. In fact, I would pay more for it. The game is amazing and Atlus has done a great job in creating the gameplay and storyline.<br /><br />If you have a PS Vita, I HIGHLY recommend you get this game. You won't be disappointed.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I didn't know what to expect, but I fell in love with the story and the characters. Can't wait to read the rest!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book started off as a very interesting story, then it became a great whodunit.  Unfortunately it deteriorated with far too much detail and a very unsatifying ending.  I couldn't recommend this book to anyone.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a first rate calculator. does everything that i need a calculator to do- abd it doesn't use too much ram.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Watching the second time still see scenes I missed from the Showtime debut<br /><br />Highly Reccomended. Great for just spending a weekend and watching the first season
B0094BB4TW|3.0|but its so large a file size that I'm really dismayed.<br />I would appreciate it more if they unbloated the application it just takes up so much ram when its loaded.
B00846F1YW|4.0|So far this game is really a good game. I don't care for the whole taping thing you can not touch the screen with out it saying you tapped to many times. That needs to change.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|its about the relationships between two communities linked by one girl leaving her tiny hamlet to move to a larger village.
B005ZO6NRA|4.0|Not as campy as the original with Arnold, but a good time in its own right. Overall a fun couple of hours. Don't go in with high expectations and you'll probably have a good time.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I researched the purchase of a new set of Headphones when my other headphones started to fail. I hate having wires hanging off my headphones so a primary concern was that the new pair would be wireless and they must support 7.1 surround sound because of the online gaming that I do on a daily basis. After much consideration and price checking I decided on the Logitech G930 at Amazon since it had the best price for the headset.  I could not have been more pleased with my purchase, the installation was a breeze (Instruction booklet could have been more informative) but I downloaded the manual from Logitech website which I highly recommend. The sound quality to me is perfect for my use for both music and gaming. And the wireless feature is great, no more wires hanging from the headphones. My computerr is in the front of my house and I can hear the headphone all the way into my backyard.
B00AHTYI5M|3.0|The Town was a much better film in all aspects.  I personally think the script was week and there was some lazyness in the film...For example The scene  with the motorcycles after the embassy this taken and there is a mob of motorcycles and you only see it for  2 seconds  But there is an 1979 Honda CBX in the front of the pack. The event took place in 1978….Was Honda introducing their new high performance motorcycle to the world via a country that was in the Stone Age?????
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|You'll just be reading and POW!  Colleen Hoover surprises you with a twist that puts it all together!  This book rekindled my love for reading again.  I had forgotten how amazing a wonderful love story with suspense and drama can make you get lost in another world.  This was my first time reading this author.... I will return, over and over!!  Read this!  You won't be sorry!
B007REV4T8|5.0|Best Bond ever except where Sean is concern........ Why dont the Bond film come up for best picture who knows
B0085A9J18|5.0|Movie was great and the customer service was beyond expected.<br />It arrived earlier than what was stated during check out.
B00A9X9VAI|3.0|Reminded me of 12 Monkeys with a little X Men thrown in. This script wasn't developed very well and Bruce looks tired.
0802473156|5.0|This was an eye-opening book. I gained insight to who I should be looking for. Most importantly I gained insight to who I am.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book to everyone regardless of your relationship status. If you're single it will change your views on prospective mates. If you're attached it gives you the tools to overcome communication breakdowns.
B0092MKTL2|5.0|Awesome Album!  Heard this while looking around the internet one day and just had to have it!  My Husband even likes it, so...  Check it out!  Radioactive is probably my favorite.
B0083DJWGO|4.0|Deep topics expanded upon but in a very unorganized way.  Many references to historical figures scattered throughout the many musings.  I would have like to have seen more structure.
B008602KQI|5.0|This was a gift for my granddaughter. We watched it together several times which has to be done to understand it.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I liked that the book was written from the perspective of different characters. It is one of those books you just can't put down because you want to know what happens next.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Script and editing was nice and tight. As with the &#34;Hurt Locker&#34;, Kathleen Bigelow has that unique ability, very similar to Ridley Scott,  filming conflict with a minimum of violence and gore. A tribute to her. I believe this movie, in any other year except this year, being in a tough field, would have won a basket full of Oscars. I can also say that, being from a very similar background to the members of SEAL Team 6 (not a member, not even a SEAL, different branch of service), that these missions are fraught with danger, and unusual humor. Well done, Ms. Bigelow; I'm a huge fan.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have to say that I absolutely love Downton Abbey. The actors do such a wonderful job at portraying the characters. Very well written and adapted for television. I can't wait for season 4!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game but for some reason it doesn't keep my score everyday it's back to zero? I have subway suffer on my android and it keeps my score there but not on my kindle. Can someone please tell me how to fix this because my nephew plays on my phone and I play on my kindle.<br /><br />Thank You...
B002VWNIDG|5.0|The Shining is a true Stephen King classic horror movie. Jack Nicholson invented crazy...<br />A great movie to revisit year after year.
B008XX6J4C|4.0|Undoubtedly, these guys are very talented musically, especially when they came up with refreshing twist to all the tunes. However, their performances were an absolute treat to watch via You Tube! One that really blew me away was the combination of Taylor Swift's Love Story with Coldplay's Viva La Vida. You can see that they were having such a great time, playing it! Check it out and you will see what I mean.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|This app really works . I love it so far. I did have a issue but developer e-mailed me the fix. Only issue is no play all or way to make play list without downloading a second app which is not stable. Developer assured me New update will have a list option<br />I await with anticipation and will give five stars when it comes<br /><br />UPDATE please disregard above review. Worked great but now sucks. Developer no longer responds to questions. From most recent reviews I'm not the only person who has this issue. Don't waste your time I will no longer reccomend this app to ANYONE.<br />...
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I fell so in love with Chistian Grey. I literally cried at the end of this book. It is so romantic and leaves you wanting more. Great conclusion to the fifty shades trilogy.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|As an experienced practitioner in the metaphysical world, I embarked on the reading of this book with some wariness.  Was it an &#34;I've seen the light ! &#34; and I've now joined the ranks of the convinced, type of book?<br /><br />No, it is far more than this, a truly remarkable journey by a left brain scientist into the world of scientific discovery, examining facts and accepting the data as a true scientist must do.<br /><br />A true skeptic owes it to themselves to examine and conclude.<br /><br />This is one for the skeptics !
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Wonderful. beautiful. emotional... Now I'm impatiently waiting for Walking Disaster! Travis is in my top three favorite book boyfriends for sure.
B001AUKUS6|5.0|This album is not only written well, the production is excellent in a 3 dimensional sound.<br />The last two tracks a fillers not as strong but it was great to get this album and rock the Neighborhood at half volume it was kicking.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|The Hobbit is an absolutely wonderful story.  It is at its core, the fight of good versus evil.  It shows the strenghts and weaknesses of ordinary people, and the heights to which they can rise in times of trouble.  It shows the price people can pay for embracing evil, in the case of Gollum.  But for me, it's most telling point, is the fact that the smallest of people can achieve incredible things.  JRV
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this game it is so awesome!!!:)<br />it is the best game i have on my electronics! this beats temple run
B005OCFHHK|1.0|The CD's were mislabeled &#34;The Sorcerer's Castel&#34;.  This was a knock off of the real box set.  There were actual scenes in certian movies that were not even included.  DO NOT BUY!!!  I went out to best buy and paid the $85 and got the real deal with all the scenes and extras.
B00BW5K5DO|4.0|I have this game on PC &amp; I love it there as well. I have been waiting for this game for the kindle and it has not disappointed thus far! Although it's a great game I took a point off because I had to purchase the full version less then half way through. I would recommend this game to any who likes time management &amp; building games. Fun times worth the $ to me.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|My family watched this movie and loved.  My children are ages 9-16 and we did find it necessary to edit/mute and close eyes for a couple of scenes that were TMI for children.  If you watch it first, you will know which parts are a concern. The messages in this movie of forgiveness, grace, mercy and love are powerful.  Then, there is the music.  We all can't get enough of it and we bought the soundtrack right after we saw it in the theatre.  Brilliant!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|i got the hame today and im having fun i see dragons thst are amazing and i can wait to catch them all.
1449410243|5.0|Really caught me off guard how funny this book is. I bought it as a stocking stuffer for my mom and ended up reading the whole thing in one setting before giving it to her.
B005UDD1R6|1.0|I admit I enjoyed the app until I tried to purge some files to increase memory. I was not able to delete anything! Even when I removed the app and reinstalled the files were still there.
B008XG1X18|5.0|My favorite app....So much fun and information.I love sharing all the wonderful things I find on Pinterest if I could I would spend hours and hours on there.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is an amazing game. I love it! I only just got a kindle this morning and I've been annoying my little brother ever since I heard about it! Now that I have a kindle I've been on it forever!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!
B004X4QW42|4.0|This was a good movie; but, not quite as good as IP MAN.  There's still plenty of action and it was well put together.  I'd still recommend it to anyone.
B00563K3DA|5.0|This was THE best book I have ever read.  Ever !  A very easy, fun to read book that kept my attention.  As easy and fun as it is to read, it is a very inspiring and life changing book.  Absolutely Awesome !  I bought a copy for each of my children.  If you're only going to read one book this year, this is the one.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is awesome. You never know whats gonna happen next, the actors are excellent! I hate to see the seasons come to a end, it's definitely a must see!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this is awesome it is fun all my friends play it it cool super fun cool and fun I love it some many dragons

160941392X|5.0|The ending had a little twist I wasn't expecting! Turned out to be a great book! I recommend this book if you like any Nicholas Sparks books.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|We used this to make a few cake toppers for our sons birthday. After we cleaned the icing off the pieces, he used it one time before losing all the pieces.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Don't mess with your CPU get this for you thermal compound and you wont be disappointed, And you should be able to do 4-5 CPU's with the amount they give!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book is gripping from the very beginning.  I love the unique way she tells a story.  Very talented writer!
B000B7HZXM|4.0|I enjoy all types of music and really a fan of this era of songs. Catchy, melodic, straight forward, memorable tunes. You wouldn't think Rod would do them justice but he does. I was very pleasantly surprised. His duets with Diana an Chaka (on different songs) are both very good. Neither song sounds like the artists are out of their element and both ladies compliment Rod's voice very well. His duet with Sir Elton is very good as well. They all have put their usual artistic stamp on each song which keeps it delightful. This CD can be listened to in its entirety without the feeling you're listening to old folks music.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|A nice cloud to get access to from several computers or tablets. So I can see and show my fhotos anywhere.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Absolutely amazing movie! I loved the story, the animals,  and the Indian culture! I'm a fan of this movie, and will definitely watch the movie again.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|This is one of the best live presentations of the RHCP, you feel the music and the emotions like you were at Slane Caste.
B000059TEP|5.0|this is a great film for all the fans who loved Swayze Demi and Whoopi Creepy suspense~full errie & long, get it on whith the GHOST...!!! And Classic love scene Pottery~RULES~dude...!!! Fire up the oven...!!! Baby...!!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|One of the things I really liked is that the author, George R R Martin, puts an incredible amount of detail into each character so you feel you actually know them.  Some you will love and some not but just when you think you know what's going to happen next there's a twist throw in.  Really keeps you going.  My only problem with this book is that book six isn't written yet!  Oh what a let down.
B0098460O4|3.0|Jonathan and Charlotte's strengths are in their voices. This recording had far too much background orchestration, etc. which really distracted from their amazing talents.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The story just continues to get better.  One of the things I like is that there is so much detail that it literally puts you right there.  There are some characters you will truly love and there are a couple you will hate, but, it all makes for a real adventure in reading.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Worth the time to see the house and listen to the cast members comments. Learn why the current occupants allow filming there.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|The Game of Thrones was recommended to me by my grandson who knows I am a Tolkein fan.  From the first chapter I was hooked so, of course, I had to read book two.  If you are also watching the series on HBO you will find the first book and show coincide but book two is much, much better than the second season because of the detail.  I warn you though that if you start reading these books you will not be able to put them down til you finish book five and then the big let down...book six has not been written yet.  I don't know how I will be able to wait!!!
B0027MJU00|4.0|I couldn't put this down! Great twists and turns that keep u guessing! The characters were so messed up yet intriguing!<br />I liked & hated them all at different times!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The story starts with a family, Lord Eddard Stark's, which takes place in a fantasy Earth similar to Tolkein's Middle Earth.  From the beginning it will capture you and you won't be able to put the book down.  When my Kindle needed to be recharged I would continue reading while it was being charged.  This story is an absolute must read if you enjoy fantasy.  The author is an amazing writer who gives so much detail that you become addicited.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|This had me at the edge of my seat the whole episode. If you are looking for something to take hours out of your life then you better start with Breaking Bad.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|If you have read the previous books I can't even imagine not reading this one too.  It continues to build the stories of the various characters which are totally captivating.  As I said in previous reviews, these books are so good that you won't be able to put them down.
B004XZR63M|4.0|Taught me great life lessons that I will use for the rest of my life. Wish it wasn't so expensive though.

B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game gives u 2 options tilt or touch. even though tilt is reccomended is till prefer touch with my kindle fire. also even though you can buy gems and coins with real money, you really dont have to like in some games they give you no choice at all. This is totally one of my top 10.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Love this movie and it was a great price. I can't wait to buy more movies from this site! Yay!
B0084670FU|5.0|Excellent movie, good story plot and the sub-plots were a good twist<br />and how they were tied together was good. And why do I have have a specific number of words???
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show so much and once I finish this season I'm going to get season 3! I can't wait!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really want this app! minecraft is soo addicting! All of my friends love it! I just cannot get it because of the cost! I wish it was the free app of the day! If you love useing your imagination to create your own world then this app is a must have for you! :)
B001DE29SS|5.0|The first time I saw this movie it was on VHS, so it's nice to now have it on DVD!
0920668364|5.0|This book made me cry. It is such a wonderful tale of a mother and her child. The stages of the child's life all the way to where the child becomes a parent and the cycle repeats itself. A beautiful story of &#34;circle of life&#34; hidden in a child's book. I would give this book a gazillion stars plus more.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|I just like the revenge type movies.  Charlie even gets the girl of his dreams that was is his mentors daughter.  You know that were going to end up together anyway.  Only one part of her in her black bra for a few seconds that is anything inappropriate.<br />One of those stick it to ya movies.<br />Also a personal movie as this was the first movie my girl and I saw together with a group of friends several years ago.
B003YUSARI|4.0|Great casual shoes/sneakers. I only gave them a 4 because I had to return them for a larger size. I have both the Leather Hover Slip-on and the Santa Cruz in size 11 and they're fine. I don't understand why these would run small. Exchanged for size 12 and now I'm a happy camper. I'd buy them again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game and the different types of countries that there are!I absolutely love it I play it every day.
B00992CF6W|5.0|1 through 4 are not good enough it should have a 900 star button then they can discribe this app it is one of the best games in the market
B009NX409M|5.0|Was a very moving love story. I loved it.<br />You wanted them together but  also liked the spouses and they fought so hard to stay away from each other. The end was a happy tear time.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I was an early adopter on Pinterest back when you had to submit a request and be approved, so I was delighted to have the app available for kindle. Good functionality and stable. Thanks.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It works OK, but the ads are kind of annoying. But it plays solitare well, so overall, a good picture. I enjoy playing it.
1597801585|5.0|And I nominate Ang Lee as director!  This book has the potential to be another sci-fi classic movie like Blade Runner, but it'll take a master director to make this complex and nuanced book into a movie. Sci-fi aficionados, do not miss this book!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has an indescribable way through his writing to make you feel like life is simple.  He writes amazingly.
0547848412|5.0|It is indeed a fascinating story and it really gives you a good outlook too what a human being is capable of.
0545265355|4.0|I bought these books because I didn't want to see the movie without reading the books first, and as soon as I got it, I knew I would love it. It came very carefully packaged and beautiful all the way. I loved the price, too. I only have two complaints:One that the second book had a small tear on the cover, and the third book had a very crumpled page towards the beginning. However, that is just my experience and there's no telling what yours will turn out like! I would recommend buying this to anyone interested. It is a very high-quality book set. Also, the books have good content. They kept me up all night one time because I did not want to stop reading. Amazing suspense and they leave you hanging until the end. XD
B00846F1YW|3.0|This was a decent HOG, but the dialogue between hunts was pretty stupid.  The requests to post on &#34;your behalf&#34; to twitter and facebook as you completed each level was annoying as hell, but easy enough to bypass.  Overall, I say &#34;meh&#34; to Mysteryville 2.
B00001OH7N|5.0|&#34;The Man Who Sold The World&#34; is a very young David Bowie doing what he does best. Painting pictures of a world in which &#34;All The Madmen&#34; come to terms with a &#34;Savior Machine&#34; and &#34;The Supermen&#34;. Hard rock emphasized by Mick Ronson's blistering guitar.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This is a great album. Every song is really good. Macklemore and Ryan Lewis are very talented artists. It is refreshing to see them do this all on their own without the backing of a major record label.
B006Z9SP3E|3.0|reading about clifton story is nice<br />hope the cending will be more shocking.<br />y yvy f f f dxc f
B00271HTLI|5.0|The movie was very good, it was very similar to the book w/ out cutting out too much of the story
B00C10N3EW|4.0|Joe Bonamassa has been called the guitarist that almost nobody has ever heard of. As a follow-up to his Royal Albert Hall performance, Live at the Vienna Opera House shows another side of this phenomenal musician, this time all acoustic, with adroit accompanists on percussion, banjo, violin, and -- a special treat for me -- the strange Swedish keyed fiddle, the nyckelharpa.
0547848412|2.0|The book was way too graphic and was mostly just for boys. I had to read it at school and it seemed like it should be just for boys who wanted to read it.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|This is one of the most efficient night lights I've seen. It is just four inches across and able to be installed with an enclosed adhesive pad or with mounting holes and screws. It's one of the easiest setups ever. Just load four AA batteries in the back compartment and set it to the wall. The light is comprised of eight (8) small LED lights that produce plenty of soft light. It's amazing that the sensor can detect `heat motion' from as far away as fifteen (15) feet and with an angle of 180 degrees. That means you can place this at the top or foot of the stairs or in a hallway where you might have night traffic. It instantly shines on and then turns off automatically a few seconds after no motion is detected.<br /><br />It also stays off during the day and only begins to `sense' when light is reaches a certain ambience or low-level. The\\" on/off/motion switch\\" is small and easily set without moving the light. With the four (4) batteries, it claims it will get more than 2,400 activations, which is easy to believe, given the low level of light and the short duration that it is on. This will easily last several years on those batteries.<br /><br />It is so sensitive that it should not be placed in an area where warm air is flowing or anywhere a curtain or furniture will obstruct the detector. Imagine just stubbing your toe once and compare it to the price of this unit. It's a keeper. Unit generously supplied by manufacturer for an honest review.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|My brother recommended this app to me.  I am really happy with how easy it is to use. I will recommend it to my friends too.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Charlize is, of course, a wonderful actress and does not disappoint as the evil queen.  Kristen gives a good performance here as Snow White.  She does a little mugging in the last 30 seconds of the film, and maybe a second or two elsewhere, but for the most part, you don't see her acting, and I think she pulls this off wonderfully.<br /><br />Believable acting all the way around, and I think good story telling and great cinematography.  It's supposed to be Snow White, not Shakespeare (critics are moronic sometimes), but it is the best story telling of this classic that I have seen with its unique point of view. I'm not a huge fan of action sequences -- I like good story telling -- but the live action in this movie is inventive and creative, the special effects become characterization and add a great deal not only to the characters, but to the story.  These aren't special effects just for the sake of special effects.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie and, in my opinion, it has great replay value.  I gave it 4 stars for replay value, special effects, creativity, the actors pulling off a rendition of a fairy tale without being cheesy and keeping me engaged throughout; and because it's the first movie that I have seen that isn't complete and utter garbage in so long, it was just such a relief to watch.
B00AQF8CJ0|2.0|It isn't worth the money.<br /><br />This could be much better.the mechanics are nothing special.the puzzles are not especially clever and the humor is non-existent.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This video is definitely a must see. The song comes to life on the screen in ways that can not be appreciated until it is viewed.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Great shipping. Good product. I would recommend this product to a friend, though I can not find any one to play this game with now that I have bought it.
B0073COMKW|3.0|This was one of the cheapest LED bulbs I could find to replace 60W incadescents. I had two pointing downward over the sink in my restroom, but the light is directional, so I found the top of my head was not well illuminated. The light has a slightly bluish tint, so I think it's actually a little higher than 3000 K. I found the directional lighting (about 120 degrees) to be annoying in my bathroom, so I moved them to my garage door opener where the directional lighting is less noticeable. They work great in the garage during winter compared to the flourescent bulbs I have there which would come on very dim and take a long time to warm up.<br /><br />There is no payout in the garage since the bulbs are seldom on, but the convenience of not having to change out incandescents due to vibration failure every few weeks made it worth it to me.<br /><br />I recommend these if directional lighting, and slightly bluish tint does not bother you in the application you have in mind.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is wonderful cool fun exciting good interesting good cool fun exciting good interesting good cool fun exciting good fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|my daughter loves it. she is far to young for a real one so this is a fun alternative. For now...
B00ARN0WBW|4.0|It was rather amusing. A good horror movie if you like to gather with friends and predict what will happen and see who guessed correctly.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This is not so much a book for adult and certainly not adults who expect a serious novel.<br />It is easy to read and the start of a series that is nothing like Harry Potter.<br />It is for the younger readers who like some action, blood and pursuits in between a story about a boy who does not fit in.<br />Let your imagination do the work and enjoy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app so much. it is so esay to pass time with it...I highly recommend it for people who luv to waste time...It is worth it :)
B009U9S6FI|5.0|The Kindle version of this book is very poorly formatted, but that doesn't take away from the book's content, that we can transcend the vicissitudes of life by determining the meaning of our lives and by choosing our attitude. Excellent book, stripped of the platitudes of modern self-help books.
B004478AS4|5.0|I love the convenience of online books. This is the best idea since sliced bread!! Thanks for the technical advantage. :)
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Read Tolkien as a child.Loved the Lord of the rings trilogy.Peter Jackson did it again.Can't wait for the other 2 to come out.Martin Freeman was great as Bilbo.Richard Armitage as Thorin superb.It was nice to see the original trilogy players in this movie.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|The movie was gripping in parts. Denzel was a great choice in this film; he's usually a standup guy in the movies I've seen, so it was interesting to experience him with his halo a little tarnished.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game i played and it has cool mobs and animals.You could get your stuf by mining deep and probly find diomens
6305692572|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie. Great performance by Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia. It is for all times !
1439152802|5.0|Of all the Kate Morton books, this is the best in my opinion. I just loved this book but the only problem I am having now is waiting for her to write another one.<br />Now to find another author that can grab me like she does, it seems that might be a big problem. Any suggestions?
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Did not like, wanted youtube. for which it was ok for my kindle. spoiled I guess with you tube app, might have to investigate this one and see its pros/cons
B009YQJ322|3.0|I only wayched this because I'm a fan of Karl Urban.  Even with so much screen time, he couldn't save this occasionally preposterous movie.  Who didn't know that the plucky rookie would definitely ...at the end?<br /><br />It wasn't all bad, If I could turn back time, I would have rented and not purchased it.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|I understand now why this movie was so popular! Very well done. Interestingly, we have been viewing the series \\"The Civil War\\" and \\"Lincoln\\" went right along with my present state of mind!!
B0052FYPJK|5.0|It allowed me problem my mind not just to one thin but all things in this world to take from what is useful to me and leave what isn't.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|great graphics and easy to play<br />you have to be Careful. it does want you to spend your own money<br />but you don't have to
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is way better than temple run.I would say there's nothing better than this.In temple run the temple is ugly.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Story continues................ excellent historical fiction of the events leading up to, and following WW II.  Characters are developed more substantially.
B00004XPPK|5.0|Considering this old movie was in black & white it gave the perfect and<br />capturing that &#34;going back into time&#34;  process. My 89 yr. old mom loved it as was<br />her Christmas gift.  Quality excellant!<br />JJ
B0045HCJKS|4.0|As a futureshock/dystopian fan, I have had this movie on VHS for some time. Yes, I'm that old. Finally decided to get it on DVD. Well worth it. Good letterbox format and the sound is quite an experience, especially with the headphones on. My VHS copy can keep company with his friends in the landfill.
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|I love it cause it syncs my songs onto it and lets me use the equalizer and make it sound original. And I can make my own playlists. its so amazing.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|A friend put me onto this book.  After he shared with me how it impacted him, and making me promise to read it... I did.  Adam Brown's life reflects the true struggle and joys of life.  His courage is admirable and love unwaivering.  But the power of &#34;forgiveness&#34; is what makes this read gripping.  And in the end... well, you will need to read it!
B00B9LNLTQ|5.0|They're right. This isn't Is This It, nor is it Angles. It's the most distinct Strokes album since Is This It. Yet, the Strokes are on top of their A-game. This isn't as good as Is This It because nothing ever will be, but it's up there. I dare say it's probably their second best. Still, comparing it to their other albums doesn't do it justice. In fact, the purpose of this album has nothing to do with trying to be better than anything else. It's just an album that's supposed to be good, and it does that very well. Also, it definitely isn't garage rock, and should not be reviewed as so. It's pop-infused atmospheric rock, something the Strokes haven't really touched before, except for on Angles a bit. This is probably the band's most lyrically complex and intriguing album. It's so hooky. Hell, I'm enjoying it more than Is This It. Overall, the A-side is definitely stronger.<br /><br />Tap Out \\"Decide my past/Define my life\\" (solid opener; prelude to the amazing instrumentation throughout the whole album) 9/10<br /><br />All The Time \\"All the time in the world is never quite enough\\" (pretty generic Room on Fire fare, but a welcome flashback nonetheless; otherwise a pretty safe song) 7.5/10<br /><br />One Way Trigger \\"I don't want to be in there with you/I don't want to be without your loving either\\" (his falsetto isn't bad; very original, doesn't get old) 8/10<br /><br />Welcome to Japan \\"What kind of a**hole drives a Lotus?\\" (depending on your mood, the best track because of the awesome bridge) 10/10<br /><br />80's Comedown Machine \\"So please/run away\\" (atmospheric, warped, slow-motion; like out of a movie; I always want to \\"run away\\") 8/10<br /><br />50/50 \\"All the things you wanna kill will give you spite\\" (low-fi of Is This It meets the raw energy of Reptilia; way more raucous than Reptilia, though, which is mostly a pro; also reminds me of Take It or Leave It) 9/10<br /><br />Slow Animals \\"But the next generation will forget\\" (my favorite track; depending on your mood, the other best track because of the chorus, the solos, and the lyrics) 10/10<br /><br />Partners in Crime \\"Where there's a forest/We don't belong\\" (interesting instrumentation; a really fun song to listen to; can get a little annoying after awhile, though) 7.5/10<br /><br />Chances \\"I take my chances alone/Get on your horse and be gone\\" (the beat seems oddly familiar, reminds me of a non-Strokes song; the lyrics are actually really good; it's indie pop song, which is odd for the band; feel like I would love it if anyone else sang it; this song REALLY used to bother me, but now I almost love it) 8/10<br /><br />Happy Ending \\"Teenage angst/Come all ages\\" (reminds me a lot of You Only Live Once; solid, upbeat song fitting for the end of the album; great verses and chorus; really catchy; really love the vocals for some reason; bridge kind of lags; great ending, though; I know I'm fickle about this song, but overall it is sort of plain and forgettable in the grand scheme of things) 8/10<br /><br />Call It Fate, Call It Karma \\"Can I stand in your light just for a while?\\" (if you told me it was Julian who was singing the chorus, I would've told you you were wrong; thought it was a woman from the 30s honestly; makes me feel like I'm lucid dreaming; genius) 9/10<br /><br />STANDOUT TRACKS: Tap Out; Welcome to Japan; 50/50; Slow Animals; Call It Fate, Call It Karma<br />AVERAGE RATING: 8.5/10<br />MY RATING: B+mood, the other best track because of the chorus, the solos, and the lyrics) 10/10<br /><br />Partners in Crime \\"Where there's a forest/We don't belong\\" (interesting instrumentation; a really fun song to listen to; can get a little annoying after awhile, though) 7.5/10<br /><br />Chances \\"I take my chances alone/Get on your horse and be gone\\" (the beat seems oddly familiar, reminds me of a non-Strokes song; the lyrics are actually really good; it's indie pop song, which is odd for the band; feel like I would love it if anyone else sang it; this song REALLY used to bother me, but now I almost love it) 8/10<br /><br />Happy Ending \\"Teenage angst/Come all ages\\" (reminds me a lot of You Only Live Once; solid, upbeat song fitting for the end of the album; great verses and chorus; really catchy; really love the vocals for some reason; bridge kind of lags; great ending, though; I know I'm fickle about this song, but overall it is sort of plain and forgettable in the grand scheme of things) 8/10<br /><br />Call It Fate, Call It Karma \\"Can I stand in your light just for a while?\\" (if you told me it was Julian who was singing the chorus, I would've told you you were wrong; thought it was a woman from the 30s honestly; makes me feel like I'm lucid dreaming; genius) 9/10<br /><br />STANDOUT TRACKS: Tap Out; Welcome to Japan; 50/50; Slow Animals; Call It Fate, Call It Karma<br />AVERAGE RATING: 8.5/10<br />MY RATING: B+
B008XCM18Q|5.0|This is by far the best Bourne book and also one of my favorite books of all time . Just love how this book plays out . The movie didn't do it justice .
B00795P4EG|3.0|I thought this would offer far more editing benefits....but it falls short.  Basically you can take things out of the frame of a picture, or double the main focus, but that's about all you can do.  There are no color filters or effects.  I used this for one photo to cover over a tattoo but never touched it again.
B002F3BOSM|5.0|Love the sound and the harmonics that CSN brought to the era. I was really surprised to find this great album in a re-issue format. Sounds even better than I remember. The album really brings you back!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Anna Kendrick is amazing in this movie, the binding of the two songs, especially the ones where becca composed them on her laptop were incredible.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have a Samsung S3, easy program really nice. I try to use another programs but this is perfect. Recommended
B007REV4YI|5.0|Up until the genius casting of Daniel Craig I was not a James Bond fan.  Not interested in those silly, over-the-top villains and whatever bizarre talent or affliction they possessed.  But since Daniel Craig signed on, I love it.  Bond is so much more human as are his enemies.  This movie does give a tip of the hat to the older Bond movies in several ways, but it still retains its own character.
B003JR1JV0|4.0|i like the songs but not the fact that I cant listen to it in my car. must be played as a video unless Im missing something.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I loved littlest pet shop since 2010 In fact I even played the virtual world one since you disabled it I now play on the app
0802473156|3.0|It was a little more worn/used than I expected it to be. There was writing on the pages and they were worn.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|Certain people or companies have tainted the idea of returning to a piece of art because for them, that means changing it.  Changing something great doesn't make it better--changing it makes it something else.<br /><br />I fired up this album expecting a redo, but I was pleasantly surprised and relieved to hear the same album I've been listening to for years, only crisper and clearer.  Different sounds and notes are easier to distinguish and there have been some volume adjustments.  That's it.  If you buy this, you're getting Dark Side of the Moon.<br /><br />That may sound like a reason not to buy it, but it isn't.  I wouldn't want this album to be anything besides itself.  Having already owned the original, I purchased this one anyway on a 4:00 A.M. whim and that was a good choice.  It's a sharper way to hear what has always been a fantastic piece of music.
6305910340|5.0|was packed good and came when exspected and was even early and also was cheap and packed good. Thanks !
B009KEN87O|5.0|I love this game! Simple to learn, fun to play, and progressively challenging. Great mix of retro and modern graphics, like 3D pixelated. Highly recommend!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is fun and good for kids and can help them learn how to spell because of the word you have to spell but at the same time it is a fun game for kids top play!!! And it's free
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Still juicy but doesn't feel like reading a porno. Still lots of surprises await both Ana n Christian during their new marriage
B003O86FMW|5.0|I gave this book five stars because of the beauty and creative it has. I would recommend it to older audiences. It was a great book!!!
B00A1U2SVS|4.0|I've never owned any Led Zeppelin recordings, so when I caught this one on sale, I had to give it a shot.  Though it is considerably different than the original studio recordings, it is indeed a part of Zeppelin history and I am glad I purchased it.
B00BL5EQLC|5.0|So, I saw this price dropped from $2.00 to being free, so I decided to get it.<br />I was satisfied, bit it only lasted 3 hours then I completed the Game, and survival mode wasn't all that.<br />I would rate it 4/5 stars but because I can tell how hard you worked on it, I'm rating 5/5
0446547646|4.0|I must say while I did enjoy reading this book...it was quite unbelievable...if with the could of happened mind set....it was still unbelievable..story was ok ending was unexpected for me...I dont know I am still on the fence on this book!!!
0307352145|5.0|I listened to the Audio. I found the book to be carefully researched and well-written. I also was able to use the insights to gain perspective on several work challenges. Finally, as an introvert, the book was instrumental in helping me think of ways to pace myself to keep my energy throughout the day.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the game it is so much fun! Do all of you have it? If not get it right now
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am hooked. I've enjoyed getting to know the characters and look forward to the next season of their lives.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|Somehow UFO fell through the cracks and I never had them in my massive rock/metal collection including Sabbath, Scorpions, Zeppelin, Hendrix, the Who, Ozzy, Priest, Rainbow, Aerosmith, Stones, ACDC, and many, many others. All I can say is WOW WHAT HAVE I BEEN MISSING!!! These guys absolutely ROCKED and are a must for any metal/rock collection. I'm excited to hear all of the studio stuff as well and have ordered the five disc box set (for $15 from England)!! I cannot overemphasize enough what an incredible band this is. As music has consistently sucked for decades stumbling upon a gem like this leaves me almost speechless in appreciation! Five very strong stars!
B009EBLCK8|5.0|Being a Jeremy Brett fan, I didn't think I'd like this. I was wrong. The characters are solid, the special effects are used extremely well to illustrate what Sherlock sees as he processes, and the stories are well done.<br />I'm waiting impatiently for season 3.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Just ok. Thought the story was kind of weak and the game to short. The hidden games were sometimes challenging and sometimes very easy. I have played much better.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|to see that the sequel to one of my fav all time apps is here! If you are a fan of tower defense games try this. Its addictive and has just the right amount of challange.  If you die just replay the level with a different strategy or powerup till you beat it. Innever really got frustrated enough to put it down till I finished it. And its free.
B005USZML4|3.0|It's a good entertainment, but I expected more of this author especially that I have read most of his work. It's a fluff novel, but entertaining none the less. Fluff work does not leave a lasting impression on me.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A \\"hey, why not? \\" purchase, I am finding myself increasingly absorbed by the intricacies of this game. It stimulates one's straregic abilities and encourages predictive thoughts as you move through the boards. Others have covered the beautifully simple design and music, so I shall not comment on those.
B0077190MO|5.0|We loved watching Downton Abbey on Blue-Ray.  We had missed seasons 1 & 2, and just &#34;tuned in&#34; with season 3, so it was great to have the chance to go back and catch up with the storyline.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Was generally disappointed; lingered too long in many places.Did not care for the writing but felt compelled to continue to see &#34;something&#34; new.Characters pretty boring except for the grandfather. Ending actually surprised me but also made sense. Jake not developed enough for me.
B00AWQEKIK|4.0|Be aware that about 1/3 of the songs cannot be downloaded onto your computer.  Must be copyright issues.  For that reason 4 stars not 5.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|An interesting story, spiritual and some action too. Would recommend it to friends and family. A good family movie... A rare thing these days!
078322740X|5.0|This used to be one of my favorite movies growing up. It still makes me laugh every time I watch it
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Rented this for my grandson to watch when he spent the night though he had already seen it at the theater. He enjoyed it again and I must admit I found it intriguing too!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Best SEAL BOOK OUT THERE ! Would recommend it to all even if you don't like military  books . It has truly inspired me to the core!!!!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I can't say enough about the game. Love that after you bet it you can play as a zombie. The controls are  easy for people who aren't really gamers. They characters dance when you win and the game is loads of fun. Glad i bought and will be playing part 2 as well.
B00BJA2VFW|3.0|The game is okay, but it took for ever to down load to my kindle fire.  Even lock up my kindle fire a couple of times and I have to restore my device. Once I got it loaded the game is okay.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Love it! Mavis is the best character. Adam Sandler did awesome doing Dracula`s voice. Selena Gomez was good at Mavis` voice. Best movie ever!
B00BESJYAY|4.0|very cool surfing scenes and neat setting.  I like that it was based on a true story.  This type of underdog wins despite the odds story, never gets old.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great game!!! Had a blast all the way until level 33.1 (a Tetris like level), can't seem to figure this level out... Any help would be great!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Few books have moved me as this has done.  Syntax and transposed meanings were magic. I am privileged to have read this.  five stars.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|This is also a fun old musical to watch from time to time.  I have always loved the old movies and they can be watch<br />over and over.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|HD it was not.  We have great home bandwidth, but this particular movie was grainy when delivered.  Perhaps the servers?
B000I0QL82|5.0|Another good old movie - always have loved White Christmas, but this is a fun movie to watch too.  Will add it to my list to<br />watch at holiday time.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Cast, set, writers, producers--all excellent. Just when you think it might go over-the-top in glitz & glam, it pulls you back down to the streets of Chicago, but never quite pushes you into the gutter. &#34;The Good Wife&#34; balances entertainment with the informative, something network television sorely lacks. Do some of the characters skirt believability? Sure. But there's always something about  them that rings true, Does the fast pace sometimes border on reckless driving? Yes, but it never squanders your attention or loses its tight focus. One thing is certain: the research and writing are peerless in this venue. The only thing I would change is the title.
B00BF11STU|5.0|The Expendables 3 with lots of witty one liners, car chases fight scenes, expositions, and guns that never need to be reloaded?<br /><br />enjoyed this movie very much
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is the best sci-fi book I've read in several years. I also read The Shift series and loved them too. I am anxiously awaiting the third installment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game because it rock's and i know it is not bad for you. My highest score is 456789.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I love Minecraft and would rate it a five-star game,but the forward control likes to give out and stop working, which is frustrating, because monsters kill me at night and I am not able to get my stuff back.
B00BF123WG|4.0|Hard to follow at times but a lot of action at the end. I always enjoy true stories. Good rental but would not buy.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Timberlake improves over his last effort and proves that pop is indeed an art-form. The 20/20 Experience is truly a marvel.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Top of my chart. Great game and Graphics. It is really addicting. Runs great on my Samsung galaxy S2 and Tab 2.
B003J4MACU|5.0|So of Clint Eastwood's best work is the Dirty Harry series. Fun for the &#34;whole family&#34; ;-)<br /><br />Fast, mean and very, very Dirty...
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am totally obsessed with this series.  Can't wait for Season 4.  It's like watching history in the making.  Love it!!
B00B2166BS|5.0|Can't really ask more than that of a cable, right? Prompt shipping from the company. Looks like it belongs with the nexus 10. Sturdy and well made.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game that came to earth besides the computer version i highly recommend this game to anyone
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Simple, easy to use accurate results. Aesthetically pleasing views it's like I knew how to use it before I ever downloaded it

B004J5366M|4.0|James Vincent McMarrow has a heart-breaking voice that wonderful to listen to. A folksy singer/songwriter, with a bit of a Bon Iver sound.<br /><br />For the total indie music snob, I suppose it could be said that some of the songs are fairly predictable musically, but for the most part it's a pretty solid album. I'd highly recommend &#34;If I had a Boat&#34; and &#34;We Don't Eat.&#34;
B007VUA7VO|5.0|So I got this because it seemed like my battery was dying so fast even with nothing running. So far it's been great and I've had no problems with it at all. I have the free one and from what I've read no reason to upgrade to pro...
B007DIQC90|4.0|With the energizing sound of the Lumineers and the combination of two voices that intertwine perfectly with each other, you really can't go wrong.<br /><br />The album has a fair variety of danceable music and melodic but powerful slower-paced songs.
1567184855|1.0|The reason that I came back to these reviews is that I just read the first four chapters of Newton's book and am convinced that it is unadulterated poppycock. Newton claims in the introduction to have been at first skeptical and then scientific and objective in approaching these studies. He gives no evidence of this in his narrative. His \\"case studies\\" sound simplistic and fabricated. He has formulated conclusions about the nature and functioning of the spirit world without providing supporting evidence. Frankly his conclusions sound absurd. I wish that I had researched this guy even just a tiny bit to see if he was legit before I purchased his book. If he was indeed a legitimate PhD psychotherapist it would be easy to find a bio that provided his alma mater and degrees licenses and certifications. I could find no such information. Even on Michael Newton's web page for the Newton Institute for Life Between Lives Hypnotherapy he is extremely vague about his credentials saying only, \\"He holds a doctorate in Counseling Psychology, is a certified Master Hypnotherapist and is a member of the American Counseling Association.\\" If you look up the American Counseling Association you will find that there are no credentials or licensing required for membership. Since he does not provide any verifiable credentials licensing certifications or degrees I for one suspect that he is a complete fraud. The glowing reviews found here on Amazon show how extremely naïve and undiscerning readers are.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|After reading some music critics reviews on this record I was hesitant to buy it.It turns out to be a lovely recording of some of the most soothing music I have ever heard.Andreas Italian take on September Morning,by Neil Diamond is,in my opinion,better than the original.I was also not expecting to like the duet with Jennifer Lopez,but it is well done.This is just a great easy listening album and some may find it very helpful in the romance department.I love it and play it daily.
B0060MYM3S|3.0|Still good characters, good acting.  The story seem very rushed though, take at least some time to make sure it is being told right.
B0010OMXKA|5.0|Here on Andrea's home turf,he really shines.He is so much more relaxed and the songs are all pop no opera in this show.His guest stars are amazing,and he is smooth and powerful and at his absolute best.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Had another type of bluetooth that attach to the visor but was big and had a blue back light which would light the whole interior of truck. Not good at night while driving. This one is much smaller and works great.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Anyone looking for a fun and exciting series of books should check these out. Rick has done an amazing job with them!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the story and the character development. Acting is top notch! Catching up on the series via Roku and Amazon Prime.
B000V4UFZK|5.0|love this movie, watched it when i was growing up, and now my teenagers enjoy watching it to. highley recommend.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Works as advertised.  No major issues. I'd like to see the size of the file that will be downloaded, depending on the resolution selected. A built in help guide would be useful.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|On the edge, very indicting book!!! I started reading it while on vacation in Puerto Rico and at times I just wanted to do kinky things with my husband
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Not as engrossing as books 1-3.  It may have lost some of it's momentum when they split book four into two books.  I still enjoyed it...but it didn't grab me like the first three books did.
B007SGM084|5.0|My first opinion of these books were not so great. However I couldn't put it down. My final opinion is absolutely amazing!!!!
B006X5L6VS|1.0|I wish we could tell which Android apps really work on the KINDLE FIRE HD.<br />The COMPASS function does not work because the KF HD has no GPS.<br /><br />ps: This author should contact the author of Andro Sensor; combined, NIGHT SKY's  compass function would probably work properly on the Kindle Fire HD.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I lug this app. I have a kindle fire and mine doesn't say what the battery is so this helps ssssoooo much!!! I would recommend this to anyone with a kindle fire!!!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I had purchased on for my granddaughter's kindle.  I liked it so much that I bought one for my kindle.  It works so easily and protects my wonderful Kindle.
1595141979|5.0|Storigoi are sooo evil.  Rose is a student at Vampire Academy call St. Vladimir's Academy.  She studying to become a guardian.  O'ya Storigoi are vampire but are evil. The good vampires are Moroi. There are royal families and Storigoi are trying to kill them.  All guardians protect the royal families. Rose's best friend is a royal. But she is the only left in her family. The Storigoi kill them. Her name is Lissa. Up to now, she was call Lissa but her real name is Princess Vasilisa Dragamir. When Rose first school, she will guard and protect Lissa. Lissa is also at the academy. But she is studying nonal schooling. The guardians are vampires call Dhamires. New Dhamires are made by Moroi men and Dhamire women. So most Dhamire women stay home with the children. So most guardians are men. So there are a few guardian women. Before the children I say earlier got kidnap, Rose saw a whole Royal family kill and their one guardian. The guardian was a lagan. So all Moroi and Dhamire were sad for the family. So was Rose! She looked up to the guardian.  O'ya Rose full name is Rose Hathaway. I forgot to tell you, some humans are helping the Storigoi. I feel bad for Rose get sick on the plane because it was her first time flying.  I was sick the first time flyed. Also everyone thinks she was crazy and sees things because she saw her dead friend Mason. She is in love with one of her teacher name Dimitri Belikov.  With all this, she does not let anyone stop her. Dimitiri might turn Storigoi. But she doesn't know. She left the academy and went find him and might have to kill him. I feel bad for her. Then the book end. So I do not know what happen next.  I like the book.  You should read the book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I immediately bought this book as soon as I finished Shades of Gray.  I had to find out what was going to happen.  The first book was such a cliff hanger.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I enjoy this game a lot and like how in it you can plant a crop of food for the dragons and then leave it even after its done growing.I also enjoy how in the corner of the game there's a butten that links to any other games you might have by the company.over all I say its worth it!
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I read my first Brothers Sinister book and then bought more.  They have all been good.  I enjoy historical romance and these didn't let me down at all.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|Couple of weeks in and feeling so much healthier and in control with obvious weight loss.<br />Look forward to my Fast Days as a break from totally enjoying other 5 days.<br />Takes away the guilt, easily managed around social life and family. Thank you, thank you!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|When I started the book, I almost didn't go far because of the subject matter.  It wasn't the sexual stuff, but some of the hardcore that I thought was going to be there.  As it turned out, it wasn't.  It is really a great love story with some very unusual twists.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the most addictive I'be played recently.  Very entertaining., but can get frustrating sometimes.  No!  I swear I dodged the dang train. Lo
B00BHBBSZ2|4.0|So far things are good with this product. Seems to interface well with my Evernote. I have not had any issues using a stylus. Still deciding if I want to pay price ($3.99???) for pro version. My understanding is that the pro converts/exports to PDF. I can see why this would be preferred over graphic file.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Helps pass some boring down time. One of my favorites during commercials on tv.  Anytime anywhere. I play it on my kindle fire which is never far from my reach.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Useful, intuitive, easy to use, cross platform, web and computer based allowing sync between equipment. Fire version does not seem as easy as computer version, but is reliable and high quality.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|For a kid this is a time passer and fun to<br />Play to cool and so fun I should know
B005TBWN0K|2.0|Just does not serve my need for note taking. Logo is pretty, though. I guess it is not a match for me.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the 'he said, she said' chapters style. This book just had me keep reading to find out what has happened and what is happening next.  Great read for mystery lovers and book clubs.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|This was enjoyable to watch. I found it somewhat relatable with the crazy stuff that comes up in life, yet the writers were able to make it funny and create a laugh with it.
0307744434|5.0|I love the unique narration of the novel and the imaginative characters. Everything about this book was so unique and interesting. The details are so exquisite the circus comes to life in your mind. The main characters were beautifully done but they still contained flecks of mystery. The ending is satisfying and you might even want to reread the book. (PS this is my dad's account, I'm just borrowing it.)
B00992CF6W|5.0|You should get it is so much fun I have about two chests filled with diomonds<br /><br />So much fun and you can also do multi player
1400031524|2.0|This was my third Henning Mankell's mystery. I discovered the series when I first read Firewall (no. 8). I liked it so well that I went back to the beginning and read Faceless Killers (no. 1). Then, The Dogs of Riga (no. 2). I lasted all the way to disc 6 of the 9 discs of the audio book before I finally gave up. Frankly, I was bored. The initial mystery interested me, but I lost interest when it became more politically involved. I'll still read the next one in the series.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|In terms of my top 5 movies of all time, this one easily makes it. My friend who is an avid star wars fan and dislikes star trek, LOVES this movie.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|very addicting and fun game.  five stars!!!!<br />I highly recommend this game and am looking forwards to jewel legends 2
B005G4TJI4|3.0|Worst transformers yet but that's ok. I love the special effects more then the crumby story this time around. a
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a great time waster! I play it before bed every night! Would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle games!
B009K0OL06|5.0|The acting, especially Stowe, is as good as it gets. I would highly recommend this to anyone. The casting director is obviously a genius.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|One of the most gripping reads I've had in a long time. Technically it has a few gaps but all in all as wonderfully done as you can want. I was nearly tearing up towards the end.
B001UTW7QU|3.0|I would enjoy it much more if Amazon would resolve the apparently universal problem of the Error window that pops up saying the video cannot be loaded because the Flash Player needs updating, even though the Flash Player HAS been updated. Often I can open NO videos.<br />I would appreciate a response.
0694013013|5.0|got that book for my 18 mo. He goes to the other end of the house to bring back his &#34;booc&#34; and practice his little gym routine/name body parts.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|I am a devoted fan of Stevie Nicks this CD is a addition to he long line of good songs would recommend it.  Seller is Ok took longer then it said for shipment the CD case was cracked but CD was fine
B0058VW36U|5.0|Is a nice game, very entertaining. Is for kids of all ages. It has a lot of levels and is challenging. Is a very well done game.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app has literally everything! It even has my favorite,a cat purring! I love using it because it has sounds from the ocean all the way to your everyday house!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I really enjoy this series. I usually know what's going to happen, but it's so refreshing to not know how or when it's going tohappen. Love Clare's writing style and plot twists. Can't wait to read more!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I love to read anything Nicholas Sparks writes, and each book I read is better than the last. I am reading Three Weeks with my Brother right now, and it is awesome. He never fails to surprise you right at the end. I am a mystery book lover and although that is not what he writes, it almost seems like they are mystery stories. Wonderful and talented author, glad he finally decided to do this.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was hooked after the first page! If it weren't for work and my other obligations I never would have put it down!
B005NFVZTM|5.0|Liked this X the best yet.  Great to see how they developed each character into the present day heros they are
B003FBMS4W|5.0|Nothing better than the Duke and Natalie Wood and her sister Lana. Terrific fight scenes between Marty and his fellow suitor.
B0055OK2T0|4.0|needs a little a somethin but a good movie none-the-less. Matt Damon is always great and the concept is fabulous
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Love this game this app was long over due and didn't disappoint. Have mot stopped playing since I got it. Love this app.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Two people met and lived in some how sadly acceptable way just like other people. This story is about ordinary love story in my opinion.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|puts me right to sleep : calms me down so relaxing I like you can save you're favorites to play later. great for babies!
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Life of pi is just amazing and looks beautiful on blu ray and blu ray 3d. And the plot of the movie is amazing too! So this is why you should get life of pi
B005K17RU0|1.0|When I first downloaded this app I loved it!  I do not like it at all now. I am taking it off of my kindle.
B00846F1YW|5.0|I love this type of game.  Went all the way thru in record time.  looking for more of the same.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book brought me to page turning like I hadn't ever seen. Don't think I've ever been so moved on so many emotional levels. I read TBT on the recommendation of a friend and understand it's recommended reading on WWII in some schools. I see why. Wonderful insight, revelation of the strengths of all characters no matter ones initial reaction to their ways. A true gem!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am addicted to this game. Not only does this game have awesome graphics it has life like activities that you would do for a real horse
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I could not put this one down. Great mystery for either sex.  Both my husband and I agree we will read more of David Baldacci' s books
0802473156|5.0|I bought this book many years ago and gave one to each of my adult children when they got married and now I've purchased several more to give to members of my Sunday School Class. It is a great way to find out what your Love Language is as well as your spouse or significant other. I also recommend The 5 Love Languages for Children.
B008I43DYU|5.0|I have this app on my phone, but I couldn't find it for my kindle so I tried other apps. When I discovered it in the Amazon store I got rid of the other apps.
0684174723|1.0|The only good thing I can say about this book is that it is short.  The characters were uniformly unlikeable and did nothing except drink themselves into a stupor and sleep around.  The book is BOOOORING.  I kept waiting for something to happen, someone to get killed by a bull.  Nothing every happened.  And I must take offense at the frequent derogatory references to the &#34;Jew&#34;.  Yes, Robert was obnoxious, but they were ALL obnoxious.<br />I read this for my local book club.  I can't fathom why anyone would choose this book.  I would give it zero stars if I could.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|I would recommend this to any business owner. Parts of the book were almost like the author was writing it about my life. Has definitely put a new perspective on the way I view my business.
B008476HBM|5.0|So romantic, sly and funny it comprehensively undermines the whole subjugation of women basis of the civilized society she so perfectly renders without polemic or rage.  Lovely stuff.
B0034G4OYA|4.0|I gave it 4 stars as it was a little scary for kids. however my daughter reports her kids, her little girl especially, loved this movie and ask her to watch it over and over.
B008476HBM|5.0|Always love Jane Austin no matter what she writes or how often I read it. This one of my all time favorites
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son and daughter really love this game. Keeps them entertained for extended periods of time. They were looking forward to this upgrade from the regular minecraft.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Was different from the movie but I enjoyed it. My Dad used to read us L. Frank Baum books when we were kids.
B0094LYBT2|4.0|It's a shame that movies like this, with great messages for society, don't get more acknowledgement.  The message is presented from a Christian point of view, yes; however, the message is just as important for those who don't identify with Christian beliefs.  I will say the acting was pretty good, considering the lower budget nature of the film.
B007R12TNQ|5.0|We Love the chipmunks. This movie is great and the kids watched every minute of it. We would def rent again.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This action game proves that there aren't always good games like this one this is what i call the perfect game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I reccomemd this game to all the people tht like jetpack joyride.I love this game and I just go a few days ago
0811870413|5.0|have been making bread every couple of days since I bought the book, with great results. I literally cant buy bread that will compare to the bread I am able to make using the method... buy it
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing, I knew this last book was going to be heartbreaking and keep you on edge. Destructively it was breathe taking. You feel like you are actually there, next to Katniss fighting her fight.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I just could not follow the dialogue or the action in Lincoln. Perhaps I was too tired or something but when I tried to watch it again the following evening and could not connect to Amazon's server due to tech problems on the Amazon site, I connected to Netflix and watched something else without a thought or regret.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is an awesome game.It's better than Temple Run the original, and much harder too. Temple Run 2 is a beast game cause there's a lot of powerups to get.And you have a second chance to run if you have any crystals.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The films availability on Amazon's Video On Demand is what moved me to action to set up my device to enjoy this amazing technology. Good story, great acting and I was totally entertained. Thanks Amazon!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I bought this game, and its amazing. It's very addictive and fun. You can try to survive, or let your kids play on creative. Many things are so great about this game, i could go on and on. Now, to the issues of the game, i saw in the screen shots, reviewing the game, and it showed 7 inventory slots. I don't know if this is a glitch, but i have six slots. Also, on the kindle fire second generation, i can't host a multiplayer game. The kindle fire hd can host games, but mine isn't an hd. Please fix these 2 possible glitches, or bugs.
B000YJ85BI|4.0|I am a long time science fiction reader, having started back in 1961 and have read all the classics and great sci-fi authors and must admit I enjoyed this a great deal.
B007HC3LHS|3.0|The main character's personal struggles were interesting. However I'm not a big fan of books that constantly go back and forth from past to present.  If I had known I probably wouldn't have purchased this book.
B004SDEP38|5.0|Excellent product for tracking spread sheets. Compatable with laptop. Would recomend to anyone on the go. Tried others that were not up to par with Documents to go
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|My favorite part of this game is the winter part. I don't like when you jump and it doesn't jump and you die.
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|If you love Bocelli, you will love this CD. Great music from a beautiful voice.  I listen to it all the time!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I can't stop playing it omg love this game although I wish they didn't make u wait so long like 9 hours for an egg to hatch other than that great game
B0091REZMW|3.0|Not entirely advanced. and I think the tutorial needs work but it is stills fun game especially. to play with another person. took a really lone time to load though.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good<br />I love it great book.uh huh Shinjuku Shinjuku Shinjuku highlight Shinjuku jjjjjhjjbjjjjjj jjjjjhjjbjjjjjj jjjjjhjjbjjjjjj decided jjjjjhjjbjjjjjj dessert flight high
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great game which is quite fun and mentally stimulating.  They say I need a few more words.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|I Loved all the twilight movies they could not have found any better actors or actresses to fill those parts in these movies!!!!!!!!!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have literally read The Hunger Games Trilogy 10 times. I just love the message and it is so well written.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|For breadth and depth of character development and the addressing of major themes, this is outstanding. Although some of the chapters on Waterloo are obscure to the non francophile, the scores of pages devoted to the bishop are worth it all.
B00062RBOA|4.0|Carlos Kleiber is captured on DVD on his last ever performance.  The orchestra is not in the same league as the Concertgebouw or the Vienna Phil, and Kleiber's conducting is a bit more laboured here than in his prime.  He can be heard in better performances of Brahms' 4th, on Deutsche Grammophon (studio recording) as well as on a couple of live recordings.  There is a live performance with Berlin Philharmonic, with an identical programme:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005N64H7S Brahms: Symphony No. 4 / Mozart: Symphony No. 33 / Beethoven: Coriolan Overture]]
1554072840|5.0|I just want to say that it only took one time for me to read this book to my 2 year old and she went to the potty and did the &#34;deed&#34;<br />:) Must use during &#34;potty training&#34; stage. There is also a book exactly the same for boys as well!
B00632HWOG|4.0|I like the new changes. Would like ability to create sub folders in future because I could organize my email more efficiently.
B008K8VDPU|1.0|Why are all piano apps, including this one, so laggy? It makes it impossible to play. Too bad cud this app has a lot of nice features otherwise.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|As an older woman I could relate in some way to practically everyone in this film. Many of the problems and fears of growing older - loss of loved ones, loss of money, loss of status, loss of beauty, loss of control - are presented in a beautifully intertwining way. There is meaning and hope in this film which captures the crowded, hectic, vibrant quality of India. The characters are believable, perhaps someone you might know, and the actors are among my favorite British pals. I can enjoy the sights of India for I know I am no longer able to travel there.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is the first book i have read by Gillian Flynn....the book was well written, descripitive.....I could not put it down.....Read it in one day......Excellent.....
075669812X|5.0|We have soooooo many of these books--consistent winners.  My son loves them all.  His friends love them.  It gets them reading.  This was a double winner because it had the book and the Lloyd figure.  At the time we purchased the book (Christmas) the Lloyd figure wasn't even available in stores but through Amazon I got the book and figure for a great price.

B007PKOKTK|5.0|Such a wonderful light hearted fun movie for kids and adults alike. Very funny and entertaining. One if my favorites.
B00B1EEKM8|5.0|I just included a Bluray player in my Home Theater setup [I already have a DENON DVD CHANGER which upscales the picture to 1080-I]. This was the first bluray movie that I played. It was fantastic! The picture was sharper [at least 2-1/2 times better]  than I expected and the DTS sound was out of this world. The difference between the DVD version and the Bluray version is like DAY and NIGHT!
B000YH6YG8|5.0|My husband wanted to watch it, I wasnt sure if I'd like it but I actually thought it was great.
B00BHU261S|5.0|&#34;Hitchcock&#34; focuses on the making and subsequent marketing of &#34;Psycho&#34; and the complex relationships between the filmmaker, his dedicated wife and the talented women he directed.  Throughout the process he is haunted by the ghost of Ed Gein, the subject of the novel &#34;Psycho&#34; that inspired the movie of the same name.<br /><br />Although it isn't referenced in the story, it's clear that to market &#34;Psycho,&#34; Hitchcock, the Master of Suspense, employed techniques used by William Castle, the Master of Schlock Horror, around the same time period.  While &#34;Psycho&#34; has since become a classic and recovered from its initial mixed reviews, it was the clever advance publicity and marketing that got audiences into the theater en masse causing critics to take a second look.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Good, well done, interesting movie, whether or not you like Hitchcock. I would recommend it to others to give it a try.
B00AO2P3GA|1.0|I had this for 2 months it was cool but now I cannot play mutiplayer it says cannot connect .if u can help me to fix this amazon but the campaign is ok but the mutiplayer is what I must use.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This has been my most favorite Christmas movie. I still love the classics, which in my opinion this one has become. I can really identify with the stress of having family over for a big holiday get together. I sometimes feel like Clarke Griswold!
B009439HEY|4.0|Yes, as others reviews say, this is pretty much note for note versions of the original songs.  Those reviews also say... why buy a note for note remake when you can listen to the originals which have Peter or Phil's vocals.<br /><br />To some degree I agree with that, but I also do enjoy these versions and hearing some of the different vocals.  For me, The Lamia with Nik Kershaw's vocals is worth the price of this CD alone.  Great emotion!  Better than Peter, no, just different, and very good different.  I have listened to that one track many many times.  Ok, I almost wrote &#34;Many Too Many times&#34;, bad joke booo!  And it hasn't been too many times.  Hearing Steve's vocal on Suppers Ready is fun, and also interesting to hear Simon Collins sound so much like his dad on that song.<br /><br />There are songs from Steve's solo work also, and as much as I love his playing on Genesis songs, for some reason I have never been a fan of his solo work, and his solo songs on this set haven't changed my mind.  This is the reason I didn't give it 5 stars.<br /><br />All in all, I get chills listening to the CD just thinking that Steve wanted to rerecord this material and the incredible work that must have gone into recreating them so perfectly.  Some may say &#34;why recreate them so perfectly, what a waste of time&#34;.  But I think &#34;Wow, how neat it is that Steve and so many others have such a passion for this material that they wanted to relive playing it, or play it for the first time&#34;.
