B00000K3D4|4.0|During the early seventies, I HATED David Bowie!! I thought he was the strangest, sickest thing to happen to youth culture since KISS and Arthur Brown! Then he abandoned Ziggy Stardust and became the Thin White Duke, and he was at least listenable. Somehow, between here and the release of \\"Station to Station\\", he became homogenized and pasteurized enough to star in a family movie, and \\"Labyrinth\\" was it!<br /><br />\\"Labyrinth\\" is the story of a girl, Sarah, played by Jennifer Connelly, (before she was deemed Oscar-worthy,) and her confrontation with Jareth, king of the goblins. Sarah is a girl who is heavily into her childhood fantasy world: fairy princesses, goblins, dwarves and talking worms. After having to deal with her unwanted stepmother one day, she wishes her infant half-brother into oblivion, calling for the goblin-king, (Bowie,) to take him away. Regretting it almost immediately, she then goes off on an adventure to retrieve him from Jareth, at Jareth's own challenge. Along the way, she meets and befriends Hoggle, a dwarf; Ludo, a huge, dimwitted ogre who can command rocks to do his bidding and Sir Didemus, a fox with delusions of knighthood.<br /><br />The art direction for this movie is what makes it. It immediately, like \\"The Dark Crystal, puts a baby boomer in mind of some of the better holiday family specials of the fifties, like \\"The Musicians of Bremen\\", or the Hallmark Hall of Fame's production of \\"The Pied Piper of Hamelin\\", not to mention \\"Shirley Temple's Storybook\\". A LOT of work went into this production, work like they don't do for fantasy movies anymore! None of it is computer generated, and the sets all seem to be life-size. The Henson organization put out some incredible stuff while the man was still alive, and this is one of the better things they did.<br /><br />Bowie does a few songs in the movie. One, \\"Dance, Magic, Dance\\", or whatever it's called, is actually pretty catchy, as well as \\"I'm Underground\\", pretty much the title tune. Interesting note: Danny John-Jules, who played \\"Katt\\" on \\"Red Dwarf\\", provides the voice of one of the \\"Fieries\\" in a throwaway sequence in the middle of the film.<br /><br />You could do worse, if you can get past the fact that David Bowie has to be, hands down, the scourge of Western Civilization....ohn-Jules, who played \\"Katt\\" on \\"Red Dwarf\\", provides the voice of one of the \\"Fieries\\" in a throwaway sequence in the middle of the film.     You could do worse, if you can get past the fact that David Bowie has to be, hands down, the scourge of Western Civilization....
0786868694|3.0|I own almost every one of her books, all have decent recipes, some more than others. You either love her writing style or you don't. I do. Much is left to your own interpretations. If I were to recommend a Nigella must have it would be Feast and Domestic Goddess. I cannot count the times I have made the granola and fairy cakes recipes from those volumes.
B000BNX3AU|4.0|Counter to the average \\"3 star\\" review, I think this movie deserves more credit (4 stars in my book).  I do agree that the movie was a tad uneven in terms of its dialogue.  Sometimes the dialogue seemed a bit forced and other times it was so witty as to have been inspired.  The condom-chasing scene was hilarious and is worth the price of the rental in and of itself.<br /><br />I loved that the heroine, Sarah, was a preschool teacher (it's refreshing to see the leading lady in an underappreciated and underpaid profession).  She wasn't the high-fluting CEO of a Fortune 100 company, yet she's an engagingly intelligent woman who loves her job.<br /><br />This movie boasts a very talented cast, and they all pool together to create some magical scenes. I still think of John Cusack as a kid because of his earlier movies, so I forget that he's actually in his 40s and able to play the grown-up, leading man. I thought he and Diane Lane had ample on-screen chemistry as circumstances eventually brought their characters together.<br /><br />Definitely worth a go-see.
B000MNP2K8|4.0|I watched the Casino Royale - it was James Bondy with blood, shoot them up.  There was too much in the beginning.  I was pleased with it, because James Bond got into M's house and he was going to reveal her name.  I'd give it a B.
0618680004|5.0|I was raised Roman Catholic.  I teach at a Catholic preparatory school.  This is probably the most important book I've read all year.  Whether you agree with Dawkins or find his point of view to be without merit, this book will challenge you to examine your assumptions and choices.<br /><br />I expect that \\"The God Delusion\\" will stand as milestone in American history which is a remarkable achievement for a book from across the pond.  If you don't read this book, you will not be versed in the primary national conversation of the next ten years.  You owe it to yourself to read it.<br /><br />If you can't bear the thought of enriching Dawkins, then borrow it from a library.  But, he is contributing a powerful argument to the conversation.  Like it or hate it, it deserves serious consideration.  It is likely that this book will be to secularism what 'Wealth of Nations\\" is to economics.<br /><br />Join the conversation.
0307236722|5.0|I'm not much of a baker so I really appreciate this book being very thorough in presenting fundamentals by using photos and text.  The recipes are well written and easy to follow.  The overall quality of the paper, pictures and recipe selection is excellent.  I highly recommend this book for beginners and novices. <br /> <br />
0060899190|5.0|This is an amazing collection of secrets from one persons blog- another one to keep on a bedside table. The content is heartbreaking, funny, frightening, uplifting- and what you find is a common thread in our humanity, and our shared secrets.
0140386335|5.0|Am reading to my 8 and 10 year old boys and they can't get enough.  Best find since Harry Potter series.
0930289234|5.0|You'd think he'd be the Bible, Torah, Koran, or other holy book of world religion. I would have to disagree completely, utterly, and wholeheartedly. I think of God as the perfect being, thus I think of Watchmen as the perfect book. Makes sense, doesn't it?<br /><br />I read this book once and it kinda, sorta....I don't know...changed my life. Nothing big. I read it a second time picking up on foreshadowing and hidden brilliance in both word and picture. The intense personality profiles on nearly every character in the book are captivating. The book, stripped down to story and character development, is enough reason to read it, maybe even buy it. The book for what it truly is, narration, image, impact, and themes make it the most facinating and genius book I've ever had the pleasure of reading and re-reading. I never reccommend anything unless I'm 100% sure that it's worth it. This book goes beyond reccommendation and I am actually telling you, asking you, to go and buy it. Read it, read it again, read it as many times as you wish, save it, share it with your children, your children's children. Everyone. It's beautiful. It's the perfect book.
B00005T7I1|5.0|Excellent film!  Excellent soundtrack!  Seen it time and time again. <br /> <br />Why Marvell Cariaga is listed as the main star, I have no idea.  Warren Beatty is the main character.
0743270754|5.0|This is the best Civil War book I've read . . . it rivals Jay Winek's April 1865 for being a lucid, understandable explanation of the events of the time. This book is so well written that it would be a delightful read even for someone who hates history. Besides that, it's a great story about one of the great geniuses of our country's history. I can't say enough good things about this book!
B000065BPB|2.0|Low Output.  Poor treble reproduction.  Lacking detail compared to other headphones at this price point.
B000FZETKC|5.0|In this great high school through back does the guy get the girl, he gets the right one. He gets the no-so- popular one who has stuck by him. He also teaches the popular girl to be down to earth. And the jerk gets his in the end...by a girl and a bad guy.  Just what high school should have been. <br />
B000MR9D5E|5.0|What can I add that has not already been said?  This is a magnificent work, astonishing photography, and Attenborough's narration is the perfect accompaniment, both perfectly informative, yet low key and never distracting.<br /><br />Better than the U.S. version are the extended \\"behind the scenes\\" bits that left my jaw dropped even more than the fantastic show itself.  The herculean efforts the cameramen and crews went to for the shots is itself unbelievable.  Great stuff.
B000BCE918|5.0|Love this have never been able to see all three together.. <br />Your kids will love it, spell binding
B000N3ST8O|5.0|It is a Great CD  and DVD from Stevie  Nicks. It is about time she came out with  something like this. The music is great. The videos are all quite similiar but enjoyable.
B00003CXB4|5.0|This is a great story and it's told with very good music intertwined with the dialogue.  \\"The Lion King\\" and other Disney animated films are good entertainment keeping me occupied on my daily treadmill walks.  I find that I enjoy them as much as I did when I was a child.
B000GHRY6K|5.0|Great book for enjoyable read. Written in the 1940's it looks into the future (1990's and 2000's). Great ideas to talk to high school and college kids. Unfortunate use of the \\"n\\" word makes it questionable for use. Although the look at the prediction of the  treatment of Southern Blacks is interesting and can be a topic of discussion for advanced  classes. Gomez's Martian meeting and their discussion of time is fascinating and a great discussion maker. How about writers taking type writers to Mars? So much for the computer. I have had much success with the topics presented with kids.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|The condition of this dvd is excellent.  I'm happy to add it to my collection of Disney animated movie dvds.  I'm WAY past the age of 13, but I love this as much as I did when I first saw it 50 years ago.  It's sweet and romantic, and the music is very, very good.
B000JLTR8G|5.0|This is a first rate thriller about the Japanese mafia with an aging Robert Mitchum in one of his best roles as an American who comes back to the orient to right some old wrongs.  Fast paced, exciting and intelligent, it has much more to offer with its depiction of friendship, respect and above all honor.  This film was vastly ignored when it played theatrically and that's a shame because it is infinitely superior to the type of fare in this genre being made today.  It's one of my all-time favorites.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|It's indeed a New Journey for these Celtic Women.  This group of Irish lasses are beautiful as the beautiful renditions they sing.  Cute and breezy little Mairead is a fiddler of such great soul, you'd think she learned the instrument from her crib.  The full orchestra and backup singers make this second rendition of Celtic Woman a journey you won't soon forget.
0374105235|5.0|The remarkable story of a young boy (age 12 at the start) who struggled to stay alive after rebels attacked his home village in Sierra Leone. His struggles kept him constantly on the run until he finally landed in a village protected by government soldiers, who eventually recruited him and his friends. It wasn't as if he had much choice. If he had refused he had little chance at living.<br /><br />Ishmael Beah was thoroughly indoctrinated into the soldier's way of life and it wasn't long before killing was commonplace, unremarkable to him. It sounded to me rather like a gang mentality: kill them before they kill you. He didn't hesitate to kill villagers, including other children, with rarely a second thought. He even laughed at the stark terror in the eyes of his captives.<br /><br />Ishmael was one of the lucky ones. He was rescued by UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund) and placed in a camp with other boy soldiers, where he slowly learned how to become \\"human\\" again. Because of his excellent memory and literacy he was eventually whisked off to the UN in New York to tell his story, and later he found his way there to live.<br /><br />The UNICEF camp appeared to be experimental; they didn't know what they were dealing with at first. But they seem to have figured it out eventually. After years of seeing nothing but greeting cards from UNICEF and no real stories of what they do, I was gratified to hear that they actually do some good.<br /><br />It's a sad, horrifying, unreal story that actually has a happy ending. This incredible young man is only 26 years old. His ability to tell his story simply, without melodrama, makes it compelling reading.
B00005MP58|5.0|Absolutely the best version of this story that was ever filmed. The writing, acting and direction are all excellent. Jane Austen would have loved it.
B000002H33|5.0|I won't get into how fabulous and awesome this album is, enough people have done that already.  Let me just say that this album is an all time classic, that is up there with the ultimate Metal albums, like Judas Priest's \\"Painkiller\\" (my all time favorite), Iron Maiden's \\"The Number of the Beast\\", Slayer's \\"Reign in Blood\\", & Jag Panzer's \\"Ample Destruction\\" (which probably only very few know - just read my review and you'll know why I choose it), to name a few. <br /> <br />Musically this album is virtually flawless, my only objection in this category is that there are some very minor flaws, like the beginning riff of \\"Battery\\", which really comes across as a jumbled - thrown together effort, but the last 3rd of the riffs are certainly excellent.  The only other trouble for me is \\"The Thing that should not Be\\", sounds to me, as only German Metal Mag put it, like \\"The Song that should not Be\\".  And it was, hence, no real surprise for me to find out that this was the last song that Metallica recorded for \\"Master of Puppets\\", they were seriously improvising by then, running out of song material. <br /> <br />Having said all that, there is only one final (and the most serious) flaw to this album to be considered, and that is simply the production (overall sound).  This is absolutely substandard to put it leniently.  Sure this album was recorded in 1986, but I have many albums that were even recorded in the early 80s that sound far better that this.      <br />The sound is far to muffled, especially the guitar and even more so the bass are way too much in the background and generally stifled.  It is obvious that a remastering task is badly required for this timeless classic to be restored to the status that it deserves sound wise. <br />If you don't believe me, just do the following after playing this (or before for that matter) put on \\"Ride the Lightning\\" (from 1984), and you'll immediately hear that the difference is almost as acute as day and night, since \\"Ride the Lightning\\" has a crisp, crystal clear and dynamic sound to it. <br />I just don't understand why a band like Metallica, which is the most popular Metal band in the world, having sold 80 to 90 million copies of their albums, apparently never considered remastering all their 80s albums.  As one reviewer put it so aptly, they should remaster all those 80s albums, as well as the \\"Metallica\\" (Black Album) from 1991.  But coming back to \\"Master of Puppets\\" this one is the worst produced of all Metallica albums with the possible exception of \\"St. Anger\\", but  then again here the band wanted to have an \\"underground\\" like sound, for credibility purpose. <br />
B0000669JL|5.0|My only knowledge of Bob Marley was references by Jimmy Buffett in his books.  So when I found this CD, I had to get it.  I am glad I did.  Thoroughly enjoyed every cut.
B00008BXJG|5.0|Bon Scott is at his best. <br />Every song is good. <br />This is a classic. <br />Buy it. <br />Shot down in flames, Highway to Hell, and If You Want Blood You've Got it are my favorites.
B00000D9TK|5.0|A great recording for any fan of Celine Dion<br /><br />very beautifulvoice of her<br /><br />love when she put passions to sing<br /><br />esp. in her native French language.<br /><br /> Highly recommended!
B000GPIPVU|4.0|For an absolutely soothing passionate album, try this...Ray LaMontagne is great for the office or a road trip...love it!
B000MRA5EM|4.0|The photography is fantastic and I fully enjoyed the DVD, but it sure would look better on a really big screen instread of my 26\\" (even though it is an LCD).
0375703764|4.0|I enjoyed this book, it was unique in it's style and content. There is a lot to learn from the \\"house\\" and it's inhabitants. I would recommend skipping the foot notes, they can slow you down, and be distracting - maybe that's the point.
1582701709|5.0|Great book.  I thought of picking up a penny to prove the book is real.  So far I have picked up four pennies and went to a concert where the first song was Beethoven's \\"Rage of the Lost Penny\\".  All I can say is \\"I Believe\\"!!!!!!!!!!!!
0743289684|5.0|This book is a must read. Her life is incredible. Ayaan not only contrasts important aspects of life in many African, Middle Easter and European countries but also guides you through how her perceptions and opnions were shaped.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|This collection is beyond compare.  Seeing Neil Young as a young guy with his whole life ahead of him and how into his music that he was is really neat to see and hear. The sound quality is excellent and it is amazing how the songs are still relevant to what's happening in the world today.  This is a must have collection for any Neil Young fan!
B00005Y1Z4|4.0|i thought these guys were just a one hit wonder with \\"tainted love\\" but they actually had two other decent 80's esque songs, \\"sex dwarf\\" and \\"chips on my shoulder\\". i only have one problem regarding \\"tainted love\\". i been trying to look for a perfect radio version of the song, the radio version on this cd is too short and the original is too long. if they could make a strapped down version and cut out some of the instrumentral in the middle of the song, we might have a perfect song.<br /><br />needless to say, a fairly decent cd, worth picking up if you are an 80's fan<br /><br />G.
B000I5X80G|4.0|If you want a piece of Neil Young and Crazy Horse History, this is the ticket.  Sure it might not be the whole concert and it is short compared to most CDs today, but I'll take quality over quantity any day!  The sound quality is fantastic!

0394873742|5.0|This is my gift of choice for new babies, especially since I tend to be many months late with the present. Everyone always loves this book. It is so big and sturdy, and filled with the wonderful, imaginative, word-loving world of Richard Scarry.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I am a fan, I think I watched the complete season in two nights. Just couldn't stop it. <br /> <br />The dvd's come in a nice box that unfolds with seven discs in it. Six with four parts on each and the last with extras. Picture and sound are excellent quality. The region code could be an issue though in Europe. It was no problem on my dvd player because I had made it region free a long time ago :-) <br /> <br />I can hardly wait for season three.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|If you like period movies, this is a classic.  One of the best adaptations I've seen of Jane Eyre.  Very well done.  Loved it!
B000001ESF|5.0|One of the best ever.  The 2112 suite covers the entire spectrum of rock music, from driving rhythms to great acoustic guitar, a masterpiece.  Twilight Zone has got to be one of the most underrated Rush songs (to me and what I've heard people say) that they have done.  Great album from start to finish.
B00064WSNW|4.0|First, I am not a fan of the band, but this cd brings new ideas and explores new sounds and textures.  I saw the concert from the second row and it reminds me good times from the early 80's.
B00000I07Q|4.0|Good album, still showing growth from their Slippery When Wet days and has a good collection of songs that went to be some of their greatest hits.
B00011F5DK|5.0|This game is great. It keeps the mind sharp, is very fun, and you can finish a game in twenty minutes. A+++ highly recommended!
B000001FZK|5.0|WORTH A LISTEN <br />This was a surprise to me, I did not know their music, but it's a blend of electric folk and acid jazz, very cool and uplifting vocals. A must for a music traveler. <br /> <br /> HMR
B000MRA5NS|5.0|the shippment arrived on time and the product was brand new in casing as promised.  I had a blast watching it.
B000OW8DW6|4.0|This is a great movie but It feels like I've seen this before. It has a V for Vendetta/Equilibrium corrupt goverment going on the Enviroment looks like something out of the game Killzone and the almost exact storyline of The Blood Diamond. By no means did they steal or copy these movies and if you like any of those movies then you will probably enjoy this. I like how Clive Owens character is a spectator almost in some of the battle scenes rather than just grabbing a gun and having him be some soldier hero like Lenardo in Blood Diamond. That was one nice change from the other movies.
B000069CWE|5.0|I loved this CD.  Every song on this album is great.
B000005IU1|1.0|I bought this disc thinking it would be like Raw Power. I was wrong. The songs aren't nearly as heavy, fast or energentic. James Williamson was crucial to this band. All you Ron Asheton fans are deluded. There is no comparison. Without Willaimson The Stooges are lacking any intresting guitar parts. The only song worth listening to again is \\"No fun\\" Don't buy this album if you like Raw Power. If you find a good song let me know.
B00004UFTU|5.0|Fair price, product in excellent conditons. I chose UPS ground because is cheaper and still I got the CD within a week.  Thx!
B000BJS4SU|5.0|Wow! But I am also a John Mayer fan. I really enjoyed this CD -- great combination of his own modern style and classic rock/blues. I liked every song on the CD.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|This was one of my favorites when I was growing up.  I;m excited that it's now out on DVD.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is created by the creator of Angel Joss Whedon.  And you'd think a guy who has written and created a series about a vampire with a soul, could not do a sci-fi series?  Not true.  Like Angel, Firefly has the same sense of friends, co-workers, who become family.  Complicated and deep relations between characters and very witty banter between characters.  This series single handly made me like a science fiction series.  Because this series not only a sci-fi but it is also a Western as well.  If you're a fan of Lost, 24, Prison Break, Heroes, or any of those other garbage fictional series.  This is not the series for you, but if you want to see a television series, that will make you think and leave you satisifed by the end of the evening but still make you wanting more.  This is the series for you.   It's got action, comedy, romance, horror, Utopian society, and Western gun fights.  This series is true Joss Whedon work.
1582701709|5.0|I recomend this book to everybody and I'm telling all my family and friends to buy it because i will never give up my copy!!!! Read this book! It doesnt go against anybodies belief system or religious preference...its a beautiful life changing book! Priceless!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Like the title says, if you haven't seen the series Firefly it's going to take you a few viewings of this DVD to comprehend what's going on.  And after those viewings you're still going to go \\"huh\\"?  The reason is that this film picks up at almost the exact time the series ends give or take a few months or so.  Although this DVD does a great job of finishing the whole story.  The television series and the film, so if you have the television series, this film will make the story come full circle.
B000N6U0EC|5.0|This movie is one of the best, in my opinion, that has come around in a long time.  This movie made you have a connection with the characters.  By far Will Smith's best movie to date, he really conveys the hopefulness of the main character. <br /> <br />The only other thing I can say is; get ready for a rollercoaster of emotions, because that's what this movie gives you.
0449000729|4.0|This is a \\"Readers\\" book and is best enjoyed thru steady reading.  Open your mind and go back to that time - accept it for when and what it was.  The only way to truly enjoy a book (in my personal opinion) is to be able to put yourself there, at that time and in that place.
1416905014|5.0|I got this as a gift for a 5 year old girl that I have babysat for that loves princesses. Not only does she love this absolutely beautiful book, her mother loves it too. I may even buy one for my adult self! The pop-up carriage is truly unbelievably engineered and gorgeous. I highly recommend it!
0962477060|1.0|As I v'e read in other reviews, this book goes from major open string chords straight to barre chords which at this stage in the game I am not capable of doing. I like the logic presented here and will come back to this book once I've developed more hand strength and basic skills.
0060776579|4.0|A great product to bring your mind in a state of reflection and realinement of becoming successful!
B000NA1OXY|3.0|As an adult music lover, I became a fan of Avril Lavigne with her last CD \\"Under My Skin\\" - probably because of it's mature sound (and excellent songwriting assistance from the brilliant Chantal Kreviazuk). Honestly, the one track on that album that sounded like a step back to teeny bop was the upbeat \\"He Wasn't\\" which wasn't a bad song - but one that I wouldn't turn up in the car if I wanted to listen to it. I actually went backwards and bought \\"Let Go\\" after, as I thought \\"I'm With You\\", \\"Complicated\\" and \\"Losing Grip\\" were pretty good songs. With this CD, I have to give Avril a little credit for putting together an update CD, however it is not something I play loudly - as it is extremely teeny bopping (a step backwards from \\"Under My Skin\\"), and it is immature with it's frequent cursing. I'm not a prude to hearing cursing in music - it has been affective with some songs - but not here. There are a few songs worthy of greatness here: \\"Innocence\\" - which is a beautiful song, \\"Keep Holding On\\" - great message song, and the tracks \\"Runaway\\",\\"Contagious\\" and \\"When You're Gone\\" prove to me stand-outs. The rest are embarrassing with their mainly juvenille lyrics. I will admit that the video for \\"Girlfriend\\" and the song itself is catchy. This CD overall is a major step behind for her, and a disappointment.
B000MXPE7O|4.0|Robert Di Niro is a great actor, but a not so great Director.  He took a potentially great film and made it a very good one.  While the subject matter:  The birth of the CIA, is an interesting and exciting one, the Director did not help his actors develop their characters.  Matt Damon was credible, much like Di Caprio in the Aviator, but knowing something about Angelton, like Hughes, on which the lead characters in the two movies were based, makes the viewer really stretch to see the people behind the portrayals.  Baldwin is good...as are most of the actors...including Jolie, who was slightly miscast as a forgotten wife.  I mean, who can forget Jolie!!  The movie holds your interest. It makes you want to see and know more, which is good.  Someone who knows about James Jesus Angelton, the master spy catcher, might feel a little cheated by this kind of one sided look at a pretty dull guy, which is bad.  Again, you will like it.  If Di Niro had been on his game as a Director(he does a good job acting as always) you could really love it.  See it and let us all know if you feel this if fair or over doing it!  Thanks, <br />Roger F. Greaves
6304698690|5.0|A good adaptation of a wonderful children's story.  More importance is placed on the \\"magic\\" of the story than on the faith in the story.  Faith, Prayer, Hope and Love of God are what created the magic and this is not emphasized as it is in the book.  This was disappointing, but other than that the setting was beautiful and allowed our imaginations to fill in the gaps that were emitted from the movie that F. H. Burnett had written.  A wonderful family movie.
B000002H4C|5.0|I had been wanting this CD for some time and was happy to find it here. I received my order in great time and good condition. I am happy with the product and would reorder again in the future if I found something I was llooking for.
B000005YZM|5.0|I had never heard this album before. I bought it on recommendation from a friend who read a review which praised it. I was pleasantly surprised to discover the musical depth of this remarkable band! The musicianship has all the hooks but those vocals will really grab you especially on the tracks: \\"BRIEF CANDLES\\" (my personal fave), \\"HUNG UP ON A DREAM, \\"CHANGES\\" and \\"FRIENDS OF MINE\\". There are some very mature themes explored here such as \\"CARE OF CELL 44\\" a letter to a girlfriend in jail and \\"A ROSE FOR EMILY\\" a heartbreaking account of loneliness. I've always liked the British rock sound much better than the American counterparts of the time even though it was American rock and roll that inspired most of these British artists in the first place. This album version has both the stereo and mono versions as well as extra tracks. The purists will like the mono tracks and they do sound good. When I collected 45's and had a stereo record player, I always thought the newer stereo recording sounded better. No exception here. If you've heard only the mono version and liked it, you should hear this one. If you are a fan of the 60's sound and never heard this album, your collection is missing a real gem! Buy this album! <br />
1582701709|5.0|Totally understand why this book has been so popular! excellent read and makes us all wonder and reassess ourselves! Check it out!
B00000F6LQ|4.0|It's mainly the packaging. You nearly need a crowbar to pry the DVD loose. The transfer on the film is the best version I've seen. The bonus segment at the beginning is cute but it's the only part with stereo. I would have liked the whole movie redone in 5.1 digital.
1582701709|5.0|We all know positive thinking is good, but this book helps you put it into perspective. You can read different peoples thoughts and stories and relate to them or take from them what you need. It really got me excited and makes me think I can better myself and my life.
B000N6U0DS|5.0|A great story, loved the interaction between father and son, they were great together.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|I loved all the songs on this CD... It's a great album and would recommend it to any Iron Maiden LOVER!!! <br />
B000MV9026|4.0|A cute story, lots of action and dancing. Loved all the penquins and their cohorts. Especially like the special effects and the added piece with Steve Irwin.
B0000024T3|5.0|As a lifelong Barbra fan, I can only say: Barbra just doesn't do anything that is less than terrific.  That includes this cd.
B000NA1XSA|5.0|Well written and a delightful read about being THERE at the beatles sessions... and being a part of the team that made the amazing sound on those records!
B000N4SHPS|3.0|This is a movie you can sit back and watch and appreciate the series and finally have closure. Good Effort by stallone But really not award winning acting either. My fiancee watch this movie (and this being her first rocky film that she has watched) enjoyed it.
B0007VZ91C|5.0|This musical experience will have you floating on a cloud. and may I just say WOWSERS! This is so very healing to the mind and emotions. It is nearly addictive. The audio quality/production is superb. being a musician I am very picky when it comes to music.  And I fully endorse this cd. It has all the power of moving melodies along with subtle touches like someone knew just what I wanted to hear.  If you are a fan of sanskrit chant you will love this and even if you are unfamiliar with chant this will turn you on.
B000O179FO|5.0|This Blu Ray DVD was excellent. I wasn't too sure on seeing this film when it came out at the cinema, so I thought I would wait till it came out on DVD. Here are my ratings. <br />Film 9/10 <br />Music 10/10 <br />Blu Ray Picture 10/10 <br />Sound 10/10 <br /> <br />The only minor flaw with this film and this is very minor, I thought the movie went a little too long. <br />
B000AYEL1A|5.0|I saw this movie the first time it came out in 197? I loved it then and have waited along time for it to come out in DVD it is just as good as I remeber LOVE IT !!! LOVE IT !!! if you have never seen it and you are a romantic it is well worth the money and then some .........
B0000AOV85|5.0|As a big Pink Flody fan, this movie could have been a still cam on the recording of \\"On the Run\\" and I still would have given it 5 stars! HOwever, to anyone that is even slightly familiar with The Dark Side of the Moon, this is a must watch DVD!
B000MV9026|5.0|One of the most inspirational animated films I have ever seen. Touching and profound in content, it brings about topics such as discrimination, xenophobia, tradition, family, and more important, love. <br />With an entertaining environment, it lets us become a part of the story and have the opportunity to do something about it.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|It's beautiful music and show. I recomeded it to see it and hear it. It transports you to a move you can be on peace.
3832790810|4.0|The imagery presented in this book is truly stunning and imaginitive.  As a man that truly appreciates both beautiful women and photography, my only criticism is that the body types of the models could have been a little more varied, Otherwise, this a great book.
032147404X|2.0|I bought the book thinking it would be generic with regards to digital photography.  However, the book is about digital photography as it pertains to SLR cameras. <br />I thought the book was a bit too much concerned telling the reader what professional photographers do and not enough about trying to improve the pictures taken by amateurs. <br />In other words, the book was \\"too geeky\\".
B000K7VHQE|5.0|We just loved this movie.  Little Miss Sunshine can't help but expose the harm done by allowing our little girls to get caught up in a world where all that matters is beauty and honed talent.  Please, if you have young daughters, watch this movie with them.  The \\"adult content\\" can be explained away, but the story behind it is worth the time.  It could save their self-esteem and what could be more important than that for any child.
B000NVIXDW|2.0|\\"Call Me Irresponsible\\" is, in the simplest terms, boring. The excitement and intensity seen on Michael Buble's previous albums, is completely absent here. Mr. Buble has taken that sharp edge that created \\"It's Time\\" and replaced it with muddled love sick slop. There are very few entertaining moments on this album and absolutely no surprises. While \\"That's Life\\" and \\"World On A String\\" are solid renditions they just aren't enough to save this truly mediocre album.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|AN INCREDIBLE DOCUMENTARY.  Everyone who has any investment in the future, and we all do, need to watch this amazing truth about global warming.  Al Gore has invested his time in researching this subject and presents the truth, however inconvenient that is to the politians and people of the world, about a subject that cannot be ignored any longer.  If we all do our part, perhaps we can save our planet. Stand up and be counted and let your government know that they need to act, NOW! <br /> <br />
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Daniel Craig is the best Bond. Number one: he is the hottest Bond. Second: he is the best actor to ever play Bond. Third: I like that this Bond movie did not rely on the gadgets and gizmos; this was a much grittier Bond. This film still has the dramatic chases and action sequences, but I don't miss all those fantastic gadgets. I hope Craig continues to do many more Bond films.
B000MRA5NS|4.0|This is a great Bond movie, but if you were looking for a great Bond movie, you could just get the DVD. Of bigger concern is how is the movie as a blu-ray. Well, first off all, it does have a fantastic picture. It most certainly beats anything on a normal DVD or on TV in HD by far, but it unfortunately still can't beat some of it's brethren. This is due to the fact that Sony decided not to use the VC-1 codec. Not that the movie doesn't look fantastic, because it absolutely does, but in this reader's opinion, the image quality just isn't quite as sharp as in, per say, The Departed. Like I said, it still looks fantastic, but The Departed just has a bit of extra something special that makes it particularly stand out.
B000NA77YO|4.0|Being a Sabbath fan for over 25 years makes this CD a must-have in my collection. Its great to hear tunes off \\"Heaven and Hell\\" and \\"Mob Rules\\" on a compilation, but the best thing about this release are the three NEW songs...My complaints about this CD are these: there should have been more new songs written for this release, and there should have been more live tracks taken from unreleased recordings. The \\"Dehumanizer\\" CD as a whole left me VERY unimpressed, and the three songs included from \\"Dehumanizer\\" on \\"The Dio Years\\" leave me cold and uninspired.<br /><br />Bottom line: It is an excellent disc, and its great to know that that Iommi, Butler and Dio are all near the AGE OF 60, and can still run with the pack of younger heavy bands...
B000N6TX1I|5.0|This is one of the best science fiction movies to come along in many years.  It's probably one of the best dystopian films ever made, and I suspect it will be long remembered as a classic of the genre. <br /> <br />The movie is fairly loosely based on a book by P.D. James, about a world in which women have gone sterile.  I liked it much better than the book which like many science fiction books by non-genre, slumming authors was only partially successful.  But the movie works on several levels.  It's a believable, chillingly detailed study of a society just a few years removed from our own that's coming apart. It's so realistic it has an almost documentary feel to it.  For example, when the youngest person in the world, an 18 years old boy from Argentina, is assassinated, the ridiculously over the top public grieving resembles the similar public outpouring of grief whenever there's a public tragedy today.  It's a world that's similar to ours, except that it's a shabbier and dirtier and even less civil.  The movie is  also the story of a man finding purpose in a world without much of a future.  It's also an exploration of how different people learn to cope with an utterly unprecedented situation.  There's a lot of death in the movie, and every time someone died, I could only think that this world has gotten a little emptier because there wouldn't be anyone to replace that person. <br /> <br />The immediacy of the action scenes in the movie is remarkable.  It quite literally puts you in the middle of a civil war.  There's a very memorable scene late in the movie when the soldiers on either side of the battle become aware that there's a young woman with a baby present.  The acting is excellent, particularly Clive Owen as the numbed hero and Michael Caine as an aging hippie who provides comic relief and pathos.   <br />  <br />The extras were pretty sparse for a movie of this quality, with just a very few deleted scenes included.   I found the film's ending ambivalent at best, and I would love to know what the director had in mind, but there's no commentary here. There was an interview with \\"philosopher and cultural critic\\" Slavoj Zizek, which I found incomprehensible but which may be your cup of tea if you can understand all the big words and literary allusions.  <br /> <br />If you like your futures dark and pessimistic, this is one for the ages.
1591396190|5.0|This book is a must read for all business executives.  As a technology executive, I only wish I had read this book while working for my last Internet startup company.  Unbeknownst to me, we used some of the methodologies described in this book to achieve the success that we had.  However, if the entire management team had all read this book, our collaborative efforts would have been much more successful and productive, especially during our offsite management meetings.
B000HCO83Q|2.0|This movie was accurate based on the comics.  But it just wasn't as good as the first one, which was great and the second one, which was ok.  To the director's credit, he didn't have a lot to work with based on the story.  Hugh Jackman wants to keep himself in great shape and the right weight for his height, according to magazines like Men's Health.  But he just doesn't look right for Wolverine, like he did in the first movie.  I bought it just to have all the movies in the series.
B000NA77YO|4.0|Ozzy w/ Sabbath did have their place in metal history.  We all know it.  But Dio outperforms Ozzy in every way.  RJD hits his notes, writes better music and is a true showman.  Plus, Dio is class.  Always has been always will be.  The Dio years are the greatest by far and Sabbath is much better w/ RJD than with Ozzy.  This cd is very good and a much better listen that any othe Sabbath out there.  Where is Sign of the Southern Cross - WTF?   Anyway, Dio will be regarded as the one of the top 3 performers of alltime and he still rocks at age 64 or something like that.  Get this cd and you will here true classic metal.
B000MV9026|4.0|The market for \\"cutesy\\" animal films is saturated. <br />Good points to this film were a bit dulled by its length.
B000MGBRHC|5.0|This album is the best thing I have bought this year, and I don't think any other record will come close to it. <br /> <br />If you dont know Volbeat, try to take some time and listen to a few songs. The whole album is a \\"hit\\". And if like Metallica, eat this one too.
1582701709|5.0|I have never read a book that has so profoundly affected me. I have read many inspirational books in my life, but this one actually makes sense and you can follow the life plan. Because of this book I have changed my attitude toward life and towards others. I believe that if you truly live the Secret, your life will change. I would recommend this book to anyone who is searching for their purpose in life. It will change how you see the world!
B000002AGM|5.0|Both musician and jazz buff can appreciate this one. Collaboration of Miles and Gil Evans evidentally not just  \\"another jazz thing\\" to me.
B000MV9026|5.0|I'm 42 years old but I really enjoyed this movie, although there were some really sad moments.  The songs and music were fitting to each scene.  I'm not sure if I would recommend it for very young kids because there is a bit of excitement that might bother younger viewers.  There are a lot of underlying stories and lessons to learn from the movie, like how different colonies can still live together and be friends, and how one person (or penguin) can make a difference.  Of course, the not so hidden lesson is that human lifestyle can adversely affect other creatures, regardless of whether there is direct contact or not, and so everyone has to be aware of how their actions affect their environment.
0790737345|2.0|Back in 1988, on a friend's recommendation, I saw \\"Wings of Desire\\" in the theater and loved it.  Subsequently, I was interested when Hollywood made its own version of Wim Wender's film with Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan, both actors whose work I've enjoyed.  I saw \\"City of Angels,\\" and for the most part I liked it -- that is, until the very end.  What a DOWNER!!  No matter that the movie gets all psedo-warmfuzzy-philosophical and time-to-get-out-your-handkerchiefs, it misses the point of the original film, which was a celebration of Human Life and Love.  I own the DVD of \\"Wings of Desire.\\"  One viewing of \\"City of Angels\\" was enough for me.
0783231202|4.0|Yet another winning performance by Morgan Freeman.  Realistic in everyway, great for all who love a good drama, filled with emotion.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|Paolo Nutini is an awesome singer/songwriter from Scotland.  His soulful voice makes him seem much older than his age of 20.  I like his unique sound.  He reminds me a bit of Joss Stone, in terms of age and style of singing. <br /> <br />I predict that he'll become a much bigger name here in the U.S., within the next year or so.  He's already big in Europe.  With his talent, good looks, and low key style, he should be around for a while. <br /> <br />My favorite songs are: \\"These Streets\\", \\"Jenny Don't Be Hasty\\" and \\"Last Request\\".  <br /> <br />
B000274THQ|4.0|This movie gave a lot of insight to the way that the East Germans were feeling that crazy time before the wall came down.  For a few different generations.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|I discovered Brandi Carlile a little over a year ago with her first album, which was amazing.  Then I saw her in concert last summer and realized how different she performed from the way the first album sounded.  Her second album is more \\"Brandi\\" in my opinion.  It's got her raw talent and smooth soul out for the world to see, and it's wonderful!  In each song you can feel the genuine emotion and heart put into it.  I love the different styles she uses throughout the album: acoustic, folk, rock, with just the tiniest hint of pop (in a way that compliments the album instead of hindering it).  The melodies are beautiful, the harmonies are better--all in all it is a CD I could listen to for hours on repeat.  I highly recommend this album (and really anything from Ms. Carlile).
1579126898|5.0|I picked up this book a few days ago and it is the first Agatha Christie novel I have read. On the back cover, there is a commentary that reads, \\"She [Agatha] places her characters face downwards like playing cards, shuffles them with cunning hands, and time after time we point to the wrong card.\\" I didn't realize how true this was until every one of my stabs at identifying the murderer in the novel proved to be untrue. The character development in the novel is splendid, and the plethora of suspects makes the \\"guessing game\\" quite intriguing. The first half of the book sets the stage for the murder of Linnet Ridgeway, heir to a multi-millionaire's estate. Linnet marries her best friend's fiance, Simon Doyle, and pays the price as her old friend shows up on her honeymoon cruise to exact her revenge. From this troubled friend to various other passengers aboard the ship, Poirot has to pick the murderer. This is the point in the novel when you start to develop your own theories, and find yourself in awe as Poirot investigates each and every possible theory, makes you almost certain of your initial guess, and then taunts you by telling you your guess is wrong. The search for the culprit becomes increasingly fascinating as several other sub-plots serve to complicate the events on the night of the murder; a fellow investigator, for instance, joins Poirot in search of a serial killer aboard the ship. <br /> <br />Various anomalies in the description of the events preceding and following the murder of Linnet, as given by the passengers on board, prompts Poirot to probe into their secret lives, and leave you thirsty for the ultimate answer as you find yourself helpless in putting the book down. <br /> <br />All in all, this is one enjoyable read.
B000BJS4SU|3.0|Bought this CD primarily for one song and after a month or so it's the one that I primarily listen to :) ( I got a woman) <br /> <br />Maybe I should have gotten it for 99c from I-tunes <br /> <br />Not a bad album, but not GREAT imho.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I enjoyed this film, some good twists. Ed Norten is excellent in his role
032147404X|5.0|An entertaining little guide. <br /> <br />Great tips and very straightforward instructions. <br /> <br />Not very in-depth into the theory of photography but then it doesn't pretend to be.
0446310786|5.0|If somehow you have not read this book, please do, one of the great novels ever written.  I have never met anyone who was not deeply affected by this simple and beautifully written story.  Who can blame Harper Lee for never writing again.  Perfection is hard to top.
B00005JPCF|5.0|This movie had everything an animated 'feel good' movie should have along with added global education part that didn't subtract from the entertainment at all.   The music and vocals were outstanding! I really enjoyed Happy Feet and recommend to all animated movie lovers.
B000M341QO|3.0|I bought this as a gift, hoping it would fall into the category of movies that one can watch over and over again and enjoy (see, e.g., Harry Met Sally, Ronin, even The Italian Job).  For me, it's not.  It's more akin to Memento, or even The Sopranos--it holds your interest, a perfectly fine movie, but not likely to be watched repeatedly with pleasure. <br />The acting--great. Jack Nicholson can be whomever he wants, and grown-up Mark Wahlberg and Leonardo DiCaprio earn some respect.
B000O75F7C|5.0|Q: Is it classic Porcupine Tree?  A: It depends on what you consider \\"classic\\". This is not \\"back to basics\\" record, meaning that those who long for the pre-2000 PT will be disappointed. It's more in the vein of the latest releases.    Q: So it's more of the same...  A: Steve Wilson and Co. are faithful to their music vision, and the style it's still hard to label. But if you want some definition, this cd could be located between IN ABSENTIA (2003) and DEADWING (2005) meaning that PLANET could have been a transitory album between the first and the latter. Not as spacy or quiet as ABSENTIA, not as fast (in general) as DEADWING.  For some it might be more of the same, but certainly the songs sound very fresh and distinguishable. And anyway, for those PT fans of later years, more of the same wouldn't be bad.    Q: Are you telling me that there isn't one song that sounds like something we have heard before?  A: Well that would be impossible, wouldn't it? As ecclectic as PT have wanted to be, after many albums, you must have something like \\"PT sound\\", an idea, a concept. So every song sounds, well, like a PT song.  I repeat, most of the songs sound fresh and original, but there's no denying that you can hear hints of TRAINS (from IN ABSENTIA) in the song SENTIMENTAL, and a section in the beginning of ANESTHETIZE sounds very much like the backing track of THIS IS NO REHEARSAL (from Stupid dream), but in this last case, I'm talking about just a fraction of a 17 minutes song.    Q: Is this the best CD PT has released? Is this destined to be a PT classic?  A: Not for me. Certainly, from the fist hearing, the CD is very impressive, but the problem is that this album doesn't pleases you like IN ABSENTIA or DEADWING, mainly because of its lenght. But I think it will consider among their best works, (so it's perfectly possible that some may see it as the best CD they have ever released).    Q: Is there something extra-special that this album offer?.  A: You bet. Alex Lifeson (ofRush) and Robert Fripp (King Crimson) are guests in two different songs, Anesthetize and Way out of here, repectively, and any of those songs could be considered the best in the album.    Q: Is there something that makes this album \\"not-perfect\\" for you?  A: As I mentioned, I think if there something that could be signalled as a flaw, it would be the length of the album: at less than 50 minutes (and only six songs), in the end I was left wanting. In defense, one could say that is better to leave the CD short than to fill it with superficial material, and my guess is that Steve Wilson and Co. thought that they reached a point in which the balance of the product was perfect. So the \\"flaw\\" is relative.    Q: Would you care for a 5.1 surround release of this album?  A: Having heard the 5.1 releases of IN ABSENTIA, DEADWING and the remixed STUPID DREAM, I'm looking forward to buy the surround version of PLANET, but at a reasonable price, not the expensive imported that is available at this moment.
B00000729S|5.0|The Monks were one of the most original groups that emerged in the 1960s.  Black Monk Time represents the zenith of their most creative work.  They combined the best of R&B with avant garde rhythmic repetition, the latter of which would be explored further by German groups, the Fall and countless others.  Black Monk Time is a must-have for anyone who has an appreciation for alternative music.
B00004RF83|5.0|A superb example of a great political thriller. Director Frankenheimer had just completed \\"the Manchurian Candidate\\", and with a great script from Rod Serling, a stellar cast helmed by Dougals and Lancaster, made a brilliant what-if of American history. As we are learning today, our cherised freedoms do, as the movie says \\"rest on the point of the Washington Mounument, ready to fall to the pavement below\\". A superb film, and one that shows where we were a a people not to long ago, and where, if we are not careful, we could wind up again.
B000KCHZK6|4.0|Except for the anti-war propoganda, this is more of Norah Jones at her best.
B000MV9026|5.0|excelent movie for the whole family. very cute and funny. the music is great
1582701709|5.0|Ive watched the movie more than once and use the book as a daily \\"back up\\" to the message presented. I find the message falls in line with my faith and makes me take it several steps further. Several of the examples presented I find I follow in my daily life already - I love deeply and try very hard not to pass on negativity to the world. In exchange I have received love and feel  it has come back to me. I feel the book and CD have challenged me to be a better person, to look for those things that bring me joy (this is a biggie for someone that is always focused on taking care of those around me without thought to what I want/need), and to believe asking for what you want/need is not a selfish thing but a way to become the person you were meant to be.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|A man of politics with a background in science, what a view! Mr. Gore deserves the praise, even if you don't agree with his political position, the presentation is scientifically precise and informative to anyone, the timing is right for an american politician to stand for the planet, and Mr. Gore communicates very effectively the emotional framework we are living within: it is just to huge to confront, but even more daring not to do so, if anyone cares about the children of your children take a look and think about what he shows. Very good.
B000JRYOPG|5.0|This is de truest shotta business. One to watch! Better than any movie mi ever see bout shotta business. This a jamaican affair about top shottas and if there is a second part mi will buy it any day. It's intense,tough and hotta than fire. Kymani Marley,Spragga Benz(de real thuggie),Louie Rankin and the real mad,tough&wickedest actor Paul Campbell should be awarded for best actors fi di year. The plot was remarkable and one to remember!!!
B000LPS47U|4.0|Yet another horror fim of the old theme, but quite well produced in this instant.
B00006IUIG|5.0|What else can I say? It's Fellini at his best.  It's the antithesis of a Hollywood movie, which is to say that it't thought provoking and demanding of the viewer.
B00007KWHG|5.0|I am so glad I purchased this cd. Every song on this cd is great, not like some cd's where there are 2-3 songs that you like. It also brought back alot of fond memories. I looked for this cd before but it wasn't until I looked at amazon that I came across it. You did it again amazon!!
B000001F75|5.0|I love Thin Lizzy I was introduced to them through jailbreak and since then i just can't get enough I have Fighting Nightlife Johnny The Fox, Live and Dangerous, Bad Reputation and Shades of A Blue Orphanage, Vagabonds features Eric Bell Sole guitarist but he does this record justice plenty of great tunes Whisky in the Jar, Vagabonds, and Little Girl In Bloom (my personal Fav) The Harmonies Are Top Notch as for Phil's Ear For Melody And Lyrics that are Heartfelt but The Riffs are classic,and the songs are timeless
B000MQ54OO|5.0|An excellent entertaining movie all around, and a good example of the high quality the HD DVD format can provide.
B00005JJX8|5.0|What can you say about a classic DVD. It's a great addition to my collection.
0060595183|4.0|I had an idea to find out about the use of drugs and its effect on the consiousness. I have found Aldous Huxley on the Wikipedia and bought this book. I am not native english, and it took me quite long to get through the book, because its language is so difficult to understand. It is obvious that Huxley is a writer with a very broad range of vocabulary to express things. If you are not native, prepare yourself with a huge dictionary to read the book However the contect was fabulous.
0375704027|5.0|This book haunts me well after I have finished it.  The charecters were so well developed to the point were I began to feel very strong emotions as the individuals in the book incurred victories and defeats.  One of Murakami's best, as well as most contraversial.  Despite the contraversy, this novel still bares his unique style, and I highly reccomend Norwegian Wood to anyone who can read.
0440241030|5.0|I have read all of the books in the Jack Reacher series and thought that the last few were not up to the high quality and intensity of those at the beginning. However, with this one the author redeemed himself and again can claim the the title of the best writer of the thriller genre.
B00068TJM6|5.0|This watch is very nice and easy to use. Great looks for a fraction of the price of big brands. I just love it. Great value for money.
B0000C23DO|4.0|This album does not exist for the converted. It's not here for the tried and true Deadhead. You've already got all of this, most likely in a far superior live version from a sound board tape. <br /> <br />This collection exists for that guy who has heard \\"Touch of Grey\\" and \\"Truckin'\\" on the radio and wants to own them, but doesn't want to wear tye-die. It exists for that young kid who has heard legend of the Dead, but was too young too see them and missed the boat. It exists for the folks who are curious about their music yet feels intimidated by the vast amount of material available out there (106 officially released titles to date, not including all the tapes out there...) .  <br /> <br />This disc exists for these folks, and in that light it works very well. Sure, it's incomplete as any single-disc best of by a band who recorded for 30 years would be, but it covers all the major bases. And it does so better than the \\"Skeletons...\\", \\"...Long Strange Trip...\\" and \\"Arista Years\\" compilations do, and is far-superior in sound quality than any of them. Above all, it whets the appetite for more. <br /> <br />So for the uninitiated, this is the best place to begin your long, strange trip. For some, this may be all you need. But chances are you'll find yourself wanting more...
0374105235|5.0|this book is a wake up callto most of us that go about our life,not aware (other then tv.news)of the horror inflicted on others. i could not put this down, tilli finished it . i will send it along to others that i feel will be touched &try to extend help in what ever way they can. please read this book !!!!!!!!!

B00065GX64|5.0|\\"M\\" is one the rare films where viewing it is compulsory.  Director Fritz Lang has you in his grip from first frame to last.  This is essentially two films.  A child murderer is on the loose in Weimar Germany.  Panic and paranoia is rampant among the populace.  The police are using state-of-the-art(for the time) techniques to track the killer.  The underworld is in a lather.  Their efforts to nab the killer are not so much altruistic.  Rather he's bad for business.  The killer's identity is no secret.  As the public speculates as to who the murderer could be Lang reveals pudgy, fey Hans Beckert(Peter Lorre).  The second half of the film is a treatise on vigilanteism.  It is here that Lang demonstrates his belief in civil justice even in the face of the worst atrocity.  Beckert, pleaing for his life, manages to rend your heart while admitting to his monstrosity.  There are many powerful images on display here none the least the statement that closes the film by the mother of one of Beckert's victims.  This film would be a good pairing with another Lang film that concerns itself with mob rule, \\"Fury\\".
B000GG4Y32|5.0|Cleaned up look, fast paced and well directed/acted....great way to spend a couple of hours.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu can now be considered one the world's first rank directors.  With \\"Babel\\" and \\"21 Grams\\" he has delivered some of the more compelling cinema of the new Millenium.  Both films are connected by a similar theme that despite the distances between people there are also things in this world that bind us together.  In \\"21 Grams\\" the device was the human heart.  In \\"Babel\\" Inarritu uses an inanimate object to connect people from different sides of the hemisphere.  The object is insignificant.  What Inarritu is really trying to say is that tragedy and the possibility of redemption is the real binding force.  Inarritu does a superb job juggling the various story strands as well as filming in different languages.  The International cast is uniformly excellent.  A challenging film but one worth your while.
B000NA28IE|3.0|This movie followed the typical fantasy genre. A young unlikely hero goes aganst unbelievable odds and wins. The special effects were grand and Saphira (the dragon) was as I imagined dragons. The special relationship between Eragon and Saphira was a nice twist on story. Overall worth the money. For all the people who have read the books, the movie deviates from the story line quite a bit
B000KX0IOK|4.0|See \\"Half Nelson\\" for the terrific acting on display.  Ryan Gosling is superb as the inspirational inner city middle school history teaches fighting personal demons, not the least crack addiction.  Shareeka Epps gives one of the two outstanding juvenile performances (Abigail Breslin in \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is the other) to be seen on the large screen in 2006.  I don't know Epps' personal backstory but you believe that at her tender age she has attempted to navigate the pitfalls of growing up on the mean streets.  My problem with \\"Half Nelson\\" is that I didn't find a sufficient explanation for Gosling's extracurricular behaviour other than as a plot convenience.  Why is this man with so much going for him taking crack?  The film doesn't offer to me a satisfactory explanation.  That quibble aside, the chemistry between Gosling and Epps is palpable so check out \\"Half Nelson\\" for that reason alone.
B000N6TX1I|2.0|This movie was dark and predictable. It has been compared to Blade Runner and this is a travesty. I would not waste the money on purchasing this movie
0975991477|5.0|This book compliments Darwin's theory of evolution, Lamark (his predecessor on evolution theory), and shows how using the theory of quantum physics can help explain and define how all living beings evolved during the millions of years from single cells to what we and all beings have become. <br />Lipton shows that the environment causes living things to evolve, rather than the \\"strongest survives and evolves\\"
B000002GJH|5.0|Chris Cornell and Eddie Vedder at their best, in the grunge band days before they became mainstream.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|The real stars of this one are not the Beatles but the Martins!<br /><br />Father and son producer team George and Giles have done such a brilliant job \\"mashing\\" the Beatles work that you really start to believe it's the lads themselves who are all alive and well and back together and decided, \\"Hey, let's have a laugh and do a live show in Vegas where we deliberately mess about with the arrangements!\\"<br /><br />The end result is not unlike the experimentation from the Sgt. Pepper and Abbey Road albums (music played backwards, medleys, segues and whatnot) so this is PERFECTLY in keeping with the Beatles' well-known eccentric sense of humour.<br /><br />Above all, IT WORKS, astonishingly well. Stuff like combining Come Together with the backing of Dear Prudence actually gives the Fabs a harder, tighter, more symphonic, more rocking sound than they did before.  And, believe me, if you're not up dancing at such ingenious medleys as Drive My Car/What You're Doing/The Word and Revolution/Back In The U.S.S.R., there's something terribly wrong with you.  There I was, a grown man, going \\"This is SO COOL!!\\"<br /><br />Anyway!  This is infinitely preferable than another boring old greatest hits collection. If you want a FUN alternative to your usual Beatles listening experience, this is it. An upbeat, refreshing, uniquely creative achievement. And remember...this project originated with George Harrison.  Can't get much more legit than that!
B0007OY2MG|5.0|The disks were in brand new condition. I would buy from this seller again.

0596009208|4.0|this is a very good book. It gives you a very solid understanding of object oriented programming world. I have done first 5 chapters . I feel good about java.
B000M341QO|5.0|EXCELLENT MOVIE. JACK NICHOLSON IS STILL TOP RATE. LOVE THE STORY. ALL ACTORS WERE EXCELLENT
B00000G3PA|3.0|I have to say this is one of Bruce Willis' best movies. He showed the rough and tough side of his character but when the cards were down he showed the soft side of his character very well. Well worth watching.
B0002V7ODI|5.0|I love this movie and normally I am not crazy about the comic book genre. The characters are so rich and the story is fantastic. The extras in this edition are well worth it.
0790729407|4.0|I love this movie.  Not just because Liam Neison is just so cool.  The story line has a lot of fact and if you remove the love angle you have a peek into the Irish Rebellion.
1878424505|5.0|Though it seems general, or maybe too simple at first, there's more here than meets the eye.   The basic premises play out well and before long, one finds oneself noticing challenges to what seemed a viable way of doing things.  So if you are ready to test your own sense of freedom against Ruiz's common sense approach, try this one out.
B000LC55F2|4.0|I am delighted, that unlike Bryan Singer and Sam Riemi, two excellent directors, that Christopher Nolan is still finding time to do normal films in between conducting one of the comic book franchises. I loved Memento and Insomnia, and this film is another fine example of his talent. It also shows that he is not afraid to tread new ground. I have yet to see The Illusionist, but look forward to comparing it with this film. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are friends at the beginning of the movie, but after an accident that kills Hugh Jackman's wife, the two magicians become enemies and rivals. Michael Caine and the adorable Scarlett Johansson also add decent support to this interesting tale. There are perhaps too many twists, but the two leads are excellent and it is a film that you want to watch again as soon as it finishes. I look forward to Christopher Nolan's next film (other than the next Batman saga). I have nothing against these films, but how can Batman Begins ever compare to a Memento, Insomnia, or The Prestige?
B0001HAISQ|5.0|It was just what we were looking for as a present for our 10 year old daughter. We could not locate it at any local stores that sold DVD's <br /> <br />Thanks to you, we have a very happy young lady!!!
B000M5AJQS|5.0|This is a fantastic film. Scorcese's films are often too long, but they are always well made and he gets some fine performances out of Leo Di Caprio, Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson. Mark Wahlberg also gets a fantastic small supporting roll. Whether the end is ideal, I am not sure,  but the ride up to it is absolutely fantastic. I am not a big fan of Leonardo Di Caprio, he was miscast in Gangs Of New York, but he has shown a mature performance in Blood Diamond, and The Departed is probably his best role to date. Matt Damon is also excellent as the bad good guy. <br />With the likes of Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin, also in this movie, there is a top cast to add to the fine story, with twists and turns based on events involving a Boston Police Department and Jack Nicholson's crime lord and his gang.  Definitely, the film of the year, and the best thing I have seen since Crash & Brokeback Mountain, which won and finished runner-up for Oscar glory last year. Enjoy.
B000MRA5NS|3.0|Perhaps I set my expectations to high for this movie based on past 007 films. When the movie finished I was disappointed. The BD was technically very very nice, sounds / video was incredible! The movie content...Not so good, IMHO.<br /><br />~e
B000002GYI|5.0|I originally wanted Autobahn but ordered Computer World along with it. All the tracks are great. I can listen to them over and over because they make me FEEL GOOD! I'm very happy with this CD.
B000002UR7|4.0|I think this isn't their best album (it's their first!) and sometimes it sounds a little \\"old\\". <br />But it's beautiful to discover some seeds of the future Radiohead's sound. Especially Creep is one of their best song ever.
078815690X|4.0|During his terms as foreign secretary and national security adviser Henry Kissinger was the ultimate bad guy. Nice to have such a chap around! All the frustrations during the Nixon and Ford Administrations could be directed at Henry Kissinger. But every bloke deserves a second chance.<br /><br />In 1994 Kissinger wrote Diplomacy. It really is a brilliant piece of work!!Astonishing how a former secretary of state commands every detail of statemanship in foreign policy. Kissinger deals with the concepts of  national interest, balance of power and power politics. The book is a thoughtful exercise in modern politics and as such a wonderful textbook for every student of government and bureaucracies. The  foreign policy of the United States in the twentieth century strikes Kissinger as ambivalent. It is insisting simultaneously on the inadmissibility of intervention in the domestic affairs of other states and on the other hand passionately asserting that its (the United States') own values are universally applicable. In the day to day conduct of foreign affairs the United States is pragmatic while no nation has been more ideological in the pursuit of its assumed historic moral convictions. Well, Kissinger wrote his Diplomacy in the period between Bush 41 and Bush 43. Maybe we could pinpoint this precisely as the difference between pragmatic and ideological.<br /><br />Luuk Oost

0439813786|4.0|This is a children's book that adults can enjoy.  The plot is interesting and the author's reliance on his drawings makes this more like a graphic novel and adds to the pleasure of this fast read.
1576462676|3.0|The book was fantastic.  The details that Jane Austen injects in her story tellings paints a vivid picture of the era in which the story in told. The story rates 5 stars, the reason for the 3 stars is as follows:<br /><br />The binding of the book was horrible.  In fact sections of the book came out and I had to jostle pages to keep them in order.  I've never had that problem w/a book I've ordered from Amazon before.
B0002F6AH0|4.0|I bought this set because it was so darned cheap.  I forgot how good this series was.  It's well worth the price.  The only bad thing about it is that sometimes the video hangs or skips for a few seconds.  It is something to see the real players in WWII tell their story in color.  I'm very pleased with it.
0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins makes you stop and think.  How anyone can disagree with his logic is beyond me.  The phenominal brain-washing by religious leaders will never be undone, but Dawkins is a good start.
0679805273|5.0|What a simple and endearing \\"Ode to Life\\" and \\"Going Out into the World.\\"  Encouraging for ALL ages whether it's a child going off to their first day of school, or an adultheading off to a new job or a new city.  Very uplifting and sweet without being cloying.
B000003ER4|5.0|Die Tote Stadt by Korngold should be produced more often.  It has one of the most haunting arias ever written,\\"Glueck, das mir verblieb.\\"  As one critic wrote, \\"I don't know if Marietta's Lied is a great aria or not, but you will never get it out of your head.\\"  Puccini liked this opera when he saw it in Vienna in the early 1920s. <br /> <br />The CD recording has first-rate singers under a distinguished conductor.  A recent DVD is good, but it suffers from one of those crazy modern European stagings.
B00005AWMF|5.0|Sade is one the most enjoyable music artist out there. She has a style of music all her own. I was glad I bought the CD. You will too.
0517123207|5.0|Darwin was one of the most brilliant men who ever lived.  He was perhaps the greatest observer the world has known.  In 1831, he set sail on the Beagle, a tiny little ship, for a five-year cruise around the world, and without pay, as  naturalist.  He had studied theology, medicine, and, finally, biology and geology.  He saw how organisms change with time and environment and how Biblical events simply could not have happened as stated.  He spent twenty-three years going over his notes, rethinking, and agonizing over the results.  In 1859, he published Origin of Species, and it upset the world.  He demonstrated evolution as no one had.  Uneducated religious leaders may ridicule it, but evolution is a fact, accepted by any intelligent, educated, honest person.
0380715430|5.0|I have read this book several times and immensely enjoy it every time.  Most of us that speak it rarely stop to think where and how its rich texture and depth came about as well as the many oddities and inconsistencies that are embedded in English.  Bill Bryson does a fabulous and amusing job of tracing the history and shedding light on the reasons why.  He does as always makes light work of a potentially heavy subject.  A must read for any lover of the Bard's language
B00005J79J|5.0|One of the best Albums I've ever Bought at Age 59 and I'm a Led zeppellin fan and a pink floyd fan too!!
0061122416|5.0|I LOVED this book!  <br />I saw it in the bookstore in a section of books related to \\"The Secret\\" and went home and ordered it from here.  <br />I read it in a few days and thoroughly enjoyed every page.  <br />An enjoyable novel that also teaches us the importance of following our dreams instead of suppressing them and doing what seems \\"right\\" or \\"responsible\\".
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Sarah McLachlan has written a real classic that will be played till the CD wears out and played again on a new purchase CD.<br /><br />  This is an EXCELLENT album I play it even if its not Christmas cause it was so great!! I gave it out as gifts and remember Amazon put limited purchases on this CD because of its demand the music is fantastic.

B000N3ST8O|5.0|One of the best Stevie Nicks albums, this one makes you wish you could meet her in person. Similiar to Timespace but better on arrangements.
B00005JLT5|4.0|This movie is really an exquisite piece. For those of you out there interested in recent history and who appreciate it being told to you in the most vivid and understanding way, will love \\"The Pianist\\". As the story unfolds, we see the grusome behaviour that humans can portray and one other, and it brings us to the realization that something as awful as the Holocaust can happen on our planet, and nothing was done about it, or done to rectify the situation, unitl so many people lost their lives. <br />  I do recommend everyone to sit down and watch this movie as it is both entertaing and enlightening to the fact that something like this should never be repeated. <br />    <br />Hope this Helps ;)
B00000I0XW|5.0|Sarah Brightman sings in good form classic songs and does a great job!!
B0001I55SS|5.0|watching this movie was pretty kewl, i enjoyed it when it first came out and watching it now , with the graphics then and how technology advanced big time since then , wow!!!
B00008QSA5|4.0|this is a sixties album and you need a interest in the blues to enjoy this album.
B000MTPANQ|4.0|The music speaks for itself, and is as good as you would hope. However, I was a bit disappointed when I popped it in, and quickly realized that this isn't actual live footage. All they did is took grainy snippets of other live shows and matched them up with spots here and there...really a pointless watch. The Video portion of the DVD is nothing short of superfluous- one would've been just as well served to play the CD on their DVD player and look at a magazine picture of Neil.... <br /> <br />But not to sound too negative, the music is a great listen. So buy this for the CD and the music, and don't expect anything from the video portion of your purchase.
B00009P57O|5.0|This is obviously one of the best CD's that The Police ever put out.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is a Police fan.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|Neon Bible fully lives up to Arcade Fire's reputation. They have become the most courageous prophets in our arid land.
B00005JLR8|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The child who plays <br />the lead role is just wonderful. Watch it with your children and <br />grandchildren. You'll probably watch it over and over. A wonderful <br />and humorous story, with a few  very exciting moments and a nice <br />ending. <br />N.
B000MXPE7O|3.0|It's not a bad movie really, just not what I wanted it to be. It was a bit too slow and dragged on for a bit too long. It certainly has good elements about the creation of the CIA and the acting is ok too, but I kept thinking, \\"show me how the CIA was actually created,\\" but it was all character development. That's not necessarily a bad thing, just not what I wanted from this movie.  HT
B000MZHW40|5.0|Wonderful film.  Will watch it many times.  Fast shipping and good service.
B00005JM02|5.0|I enjoyed this movie thoroughy. I am not a great fan of Ellen but she adds her wit to the movie.
B000NA2776|5.0|This is one of the most original, creative and musically gifted vocal CD's of its genre I have found in a very long time - I first tracked down the CD even before its US release and since then have bought over ten copies to share with friends! Everyone I have introduced Mika to loves the music! Mika is rockin my world right now!
0131177052|5.0|I am still reading the book, but till now have enjoyed it a lot. There are lots of practical example and approach with required code and explanation. Definitely a must read for anyone who programs in a formal environment - group or office. As you have to read others code, maintain and extend.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Common what can you say - She is the Queen, has been the Queen for more than 20 years and this DVD/CD proves why - dude she just  gets better and better every year - I loved everything about this musical experience. I saw this concert live in Miami - and love the DVD version it allows you to not miss any details close up and personal.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|After two awesome episodes my family began beginng me to purchase them on HD-DVD.  I am really glad I did because with the extra resolution the show became even more enjoyable.  Some say that 1080i and 1080p are the same, but I can honestly say that unless you have seen them both over a few hours of viewing you can completely tell the difference.<br /><br />Highly recommend buying this series if you haven't seen it yet.  The HD-DVD 1080p experience is worth every penny!
0201633612|4.0|clearly defines design patterns, how and when they should be used, and factors to consider when using them. a very useful book for any software development work. the only disadvantage with this book is that its examples of each design pattern are sometimes convoluted and confusing.
B000003N8R|5.0|Few albums sum the musical ideas of an instumentalist as well as Crescent does for John Coltrane. One gets the sense that all the bugs have been worked out and that this is what he wanted to say. The message is lyricism and the blues... and perhaps laughter. The rhythm section is warm and sharp. The music has the searching melencholy that is immediately recognizable as Trane. Singularly beautiful.
B000C20VPA|5.0|I was very pleased with the quality and price of the DVD.  I will remain doing business with Amazon.  I like the variety of products.
B000GG4KTU|3.0|Diana is not at her best.  Seems to have breath control problems.  Big band arrangements are unimaginative and seem to clash with Diana rather than enhance her performance.  Not nearly as good as the other seven Krall albums I enjoy.
B000N3T0DW|5.0|One critic wrote this is \\"Almodovar light\\" but for me it is \\"Almodovar great.\\" Fine, original plot with a poetic structure, splendid acting from his bevy of appealing women, wonderful colors and photography, and a tribute to the mother of film as cued by a shot of Anna Magnani.
1592402690|5.0|Beatles books are a dime a dozen these days.  It seems like anyone who has had any kind of personal experience with one or more of the Fab Four has written an \\"insider's look\\" on the group.  Many of these books aren't worth the paper they are printed on.  That statement does not apply to Geoff Emerick's book, which is both fun and informative. Though George Martin, among a very few others, has similar insights into the Beatles' recordings, no one but Emerick could have written in so much first-person detail about how the band actually recorded the majority of their great records.  Admittedly, a lot of Emerick's recording details are for moderate to rabid Beatles fans.  I enjoyed learning, for example, that Paul--not George--plays the guitar solo on \\"Taxman,\\" that John badly wanted to sing \\"Oh, Darling!\\" (though Paul, who wrote the song, ended up singing it), or that it is Mal Evans who bangs the giant anvil on \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer.\\"  A lot of Beatles fans, I'm sure, couldn't care less about these things, but for those who love the Beatles most of all for their great songs and records, this is your book!   <br /> <br />Those looking for sex, drugs and rock and roll may be disappointed here.  A tabloid type book this is not.  But Emerick does tell a lot of great stories.  His story of how George Martin naively told an LSD-tripping John to go to the roof of the recording studio (where one might easily feel inclined to try out flight) to chill out for a while made me laugh out loud, but it also made me shudder a bit.  Emerick toots his own horn about his engineering feats, but he is certainly deserving of a little limelight.  Some of us may prefer the stripped down Beatles of RUBBER SOUL and REVOLVER to the heavily orchestrated SGT. PEPPER'S or MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR, but Emerick clearly prefers the latter.  He has some especially harsh words for RUBBER SOUL, which (no surprise) he had nothing to do with, even if it is generally considered one of the Beatles' very best LPs.  Similarly, Emerick is also a big Paul fan, at the expense of the others; he tends to downgrade John's leadership, and he outright dismisses George and Ringo at various points.  John has always been my favorite, but I might not feel that way if I had had to put up with some of his apparently outlandish demands in the studio.                                <br /> <br />Off the top of my head, I'd have to say that this is the best Beatles book I have read (though I have only read three or four others).  To recap: if you are chiefly interested in the gossipy stuff, go elsewhere; if you are more interested in the records themselves and the Beatles' evolving sound over roughly seven years, this is the book for you.   <br />
0767817486|5.0|This DVD was great to see again and came to me as promised. Very good DVD and in excellent shape. I cant say enough.
B000MV9026|5.0|Happy Feet is a great movie for kids and adults.  There is a life lesson involved with the movie about the life of penguins.

B000GDH9JQ|5.0|This movie shows the different styles of dance and how collaboration can work.  These two talented dancers really know their stuff.  Greg Hines was truly the epitome of tap, as well as Misha the epitome of ballet.  I feel very fortunate that this movie was on DVD.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|If you have a heart, this one's a real tear jerker.  Look past the basic premise of a man trying to get a job.  See the movie very carefully:  it's about a man struggling for survival so that he and his sone can fulfill that American dream:  the pursuit of happiness.   <br /> <br />You just feel bad for Chris Gardner in this movie.  No matter how hard he tried to do something, it seemed like he could never catch a break, but he never let that stop him from trying.  Your heart does go out to him on this one.  Despite the bad luck, he never let showed his son that he lost hope.  He always kept his chin up as he became more and more humbled in his situation.  That's why the end is so poignant and endearing.   <br /> <br />I could barely see this movie because I cried so hard.  I knew from just watching the trailer that Will Smith would garner and Oscar nomination; however, it was a close call toss up between him and Forest Whitaker portraying General Idi Amin.  Really, really close.  I still would have picked Will Smith because this story seemed to resonate with me, and I would have given this the Oscar for Best Picture, as well, but things as they were, it did not come to pass. <br /> <br />I was surprised to learn that Will Smith and hisproducer John Lassiter actively sought Italian director Gabriele Muccino to direct this.  Muccino did \\"the Las Kiss\\" and \\"Remember me, My Love\\".  This whole movie experieince is based upon risk taking.  Will Smith took a risk on Gabriele Muccino to do this movie.  Muccino did a fabulous job being that this was his first non-Italian film ever.  Secondly, they auditioned so many kids to play the son of Chris Gardner, and they couldn't find any.  So they decided to give Will Smith's son a chance to read, and it turned out he was the best audition and he got cast.  So this is a first Father-son movie for Will Smith.  Thirdly, the whole movie centers aorund how the real Chris Gardner took a risk in his sales job to become a stock broker and after hitting a serious low and given his God-given chance, he finally becasme a success.  <br /> <br />How does a movie like this not get Best Picture?  Well, it's a good story and worth the watch with a good lesson for all.
B000AYEL1A|4.0|We normally are familiar with Barbra Streisand singing ballads.  But, when she does rock 'n' roll, she delivers it with another effect, which is also terrific.  Personally, I don't think this one is my favorite movie by Streiand, but, it is a remake of a classic ... so, I should have it in my collection.  Streisand fans should obtain this DVD because it features some deleted scenes and Streisand's commentary.
1594200823|4.0|The timing of this book is excellent.  This author proposes that our country has become enamored with corn and its various manifestations.

B000MZHW4A|4.0|This movie was quite well done & very enjoyable. It did a wonderful job of <br />exposing the dark side of the diamond trade, which is quite troubling.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|This is one of my favorites when I was young. I could remember after I came home that night waiting for Peter Pan to come and take me away to Neverland. It's another must have movie if your into nostalgia.
B000LPQ6DE|2.0|so I've always happily watched any movie and/or television adaption--until now. This take on the classic was dull. lifeless and flat. Something I never thought I would ever see. The book was really not just about a timeless romance but ahead of it's time in describing a woman's self-growth. Here, Jane is anything but the \\"heroine\\" I'd come to know in the book. She was lacking in the fire and emotional strength that you got from the book. A most disappointing adaption.

075640407X|5.0|Patrick grabs you in the first paragrph and never lets you go.  His story within a story moves seamlessly, introducing the reader to  Kvothe, a delightful, curious, and magically talented eleven-year-old boy, through the reminiscences of the adult Kvothe.  This potentially cumbersome method of storytelling in the sure hands of Rothfuss, opens up and illuminates Kvothe's world and the joys and tragedies which make him into the man telling the story.  This volume covers Kvothe from age eleven to age sixteen;  the next two volumes are already written and will be published annually. A remarkable accomplishment from a superlative new talent!
B000MRA5EM|4.0|Movies made for Imax theaters are often great for viewing at home.  I found this out with this movie; I missed it at the local Imax theater, but then saw it on DVD, and was glad I saw it.  The movie looks at life in the shallow regions of the oceans, primarily ocean reefs, so the title Deep Sea is not quite appropriate.  The narration is by Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, and is quite good in being subtle and not overbearing.  The photography is great, and viewers are shown numerous creatures great and smal.  Many of the scenes are of eating, specifically one creater eating another.  However, there is no bloody gore of sharks munching other creatures, hence the movie is fine for little kids.
B000NA1Z1A|5.0|I have to admit, I discovered Amy Winehouse during a lunchtime visit to [...] and he's right...she's fantastic.  What a great CD.  Nostalgic and new at the same time.  LOVE IT.  I bought the \\"clean version\\" of her album, 'cause I have a child...though I don't know how \\"clean\\" it really is.  Even \\"clean\\" the CD is totally amazing.  I'm not crazy about the remix of \\"You Know I'm No Good\\" ...it just doesn't need the rap, but the rest of the songs are all good.  It's unique, but familiar at the same time.  Kind of a trashy, Spectorized-girl-group sound.  Bloodshot-blue-eyed-soul, if you will.  I love her voice.  If I was rich, I'd buy it for all my friends.
B00005JPFH|3.0|some awful reviews but its really not that bad....in fact the first hour is pretty darn good......then it gets bogged down in \\"Pirates 2\\" syndrome...but \\"Pirates 2\\" sucked much worse than this one...sure theres too many damn characters and the whole Harry thing and Peter still griping about uncle Ben.....the film woulda been much better if they woulda just expanded the Sandman role cuz lets face it, Thomas Haden Church is a great actor and fits this role perfectly.....Topher Grace sucked as Venom/Eddie Brock..what a waste...Venom shoulda just had his own movie outside of Spiderman with someone else playin him.......one shining moment- any scene Bryce Dallas Howard is in.....if they make a 4th film and she is in it....im there pal...she is drop dead gorgeous...i now know what love is
B000JRYOPG|5.0|The authenticity of this film is outstanding and gives you a perfect look of a Shotta's life in Jamica. Shottas keeps the full attention of the viewer with intense scenes that will certainly leave you talking to your friends about for months. <br /> <br />This film is recommended for any 'Gangsta' or 'Shotta' movie lover. Even people who would like an inside look of life in the ghetto and what is necessary to elevate from the slums to the american dream. This movie is similar to scarface.
0307275639|4.0|Sometimes in the day and age we live in, we give up hope in the culture.  Tuesdays with Morrie makes you ask yourself how you live, and how you view life and other people.  It encourages people to live a better life, caring about yourself and others more.  Well written and based off a true story, if you read this book and are not touched... check your pulse!
0786838655|5.0|Although this book is short it has more humor, action, and mystery than any other book I've ever read. Rick Riordan will have to write some amzing sequels and prequels to keep this series as strong as it is.
B000LC55F2|5.0|Saw it in the movies and YES I wanted to see it again the second it was over so I bought it when it came on DVD.
B000LP6KSU|2.0|If you are looking for \\"The Black Parade\\" without explicit lyrics, THIS IS NOT IT!! This just has the shorter (single) version of \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\" other than that it is the same as the version with the parental advisory on it. I don't understand why they put this out labeled this way. It doesn't even have the \\"clean\\" singles verion of \\"Teenagers\\" that was used for radio play.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|This is the kind of movie you like or you hate. I just LOVED it!
B000IFQLSW|5.0|The CD is great and stands on its own, but its the DVD thats the ace here. <br />Over an hour and a half of great footage, great music, and history of time quickly passing. Review is now over. O'.. did I tell ya? beg, barrow, or steal a copy of this one, but only if you gots & gets da BLUES.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Don't you just love those movies that at the end you say \\"ohhh so that's what  happend... but how?...oh nevermind...\\" lol
0349113912|5.0|Slate magazine recently carried an article charging, in essence, that Sedaris was a fraud.  The article's author alleged that there is evidence Sedaris has embellished some of his stories, so his writing is not really non-fiction.  I think that argument misses the point - no one reads Sedaris to be educated on any topic, people read him because he makes them laugh.  If he embellishes stories of his life to make them funnier I am fine with that - I'm looking for some laugh-out-loud stories now and then to lighten the load of daily life.  I get enough of the reality of life in the news with the Iraq war, the widening Republican/Abramoff corruption scandal, our taxpayer dollars being stolen by companies our government has hired to provide services in Iraq and at home (Rep Duke Cunningham in jail, Brent Wilkes and ex-CIA guy Dusty Foggo facing charges,) global warming, etc.  <br /> <br />My absolute favorite Sedaris story is the one in this volume about the French language class he took after moving to France.  The attempts of some of the students to explain Easter, with its crucifixation, Easter Bunny story, and candy, to a middle easterner made me laugh out loud. its great that his writing appears in The New Yorker sometimes so I can get a Sedaris fix between books.
B000M341QO|3.0|Excellent Fast Paced deeply Engrossing Saga Of  Infiltration of The Irish Mbb, and Its Hold On people In All walks Of Life...A True Thriller!
076790592X|5.0|I was very skeptical before reading this book. I though it would be another \\"you sit and take notes\\" kind of a book. I was wrong! I read it, I will read it again and actually I would like to give it to a present to many people I know. It is worth reading. A very honest book.
B000MXPE7Y|5.0|Excelent Story line ...Well Done ,a good Insight Into How The CIA Was Born, Its Inner Workings and Its Effects On friends and Family Members.etc...
B00006RCNJ|5.0|There is NO such thing as a bad Andre Rieu DVD!
0345479092|5.0|Tracy Hogg provides very helpful, detailed and practical insight on how to calm your baby, what to expect from your baby, and ways to make everyone's lives easier. A friend recommended the book and I found myself reading it whenever my baby slept. Every page seemed to have some helpful nugget, like when to bathe your baby, how to recognize the subtle differences between your baby's cries, and how others have fixed bad habits.  Highly, highly recommended.
B00004Y2QT|5.0|Excellent!  I have enjoyed this DVD with friends and alone.  It features Larry Grahmn and a few other guests - It is just wonderful!
B000J103WK|5.0|HD DVD is a brilliant experience.  pity it is not yet available on blu ray.  Standard dvd is very good quality
0743455967|5.0|It's not just about How-To-Write. It's about King. And, since he's been a writer all his life, it's about writing. It's interesting, and fun, and he's a nice guy. The book's well put together; goes from memoir, to writing technique, and back to memoir again. Wonder how he came up with Carrie, or how much he got for it? Want to improve your writing? If so, you'll like this book.
B000002J0B|3.0|I bought this CD for one song: Dancing Days.  I had been hearing this song on the Howard Stern show and thought is was an original of some new wave or grunge band.  Well wasn't I surprised when I started searching for it and found out it was an Original from LED ZEPPELIN.  I'd never heard this from Zeppelin, and the only other song I recognized from the CD was D'yer Mak'er.  D'yer Mak'er is the song that was played when I was growing up and listening to FM radio in 1973.  Dancing Days has a wonderful beat and Robert Plant's beautiful voice makes it spell-binding.  The song gets 5 stars; the CD gets 3.
032147404X|5.0|I bought this digital photography for my husband.  It is an incredibly good book and the price is hard to beat!  We've looked and looked in bookstores for other books of a similarly high quality on the topic of digital photography and have found nothing.  I highly recommend this book.
B000002J03|4.0|I had been hearing Train's rendention of \\"Ramble On\\" on the Howard Stern Show, and I loved it.  So I decided to get the original version from Led Zeppelin.  I'm not disappointed.  As fabulous as Train's, but more authentic with Robert Plant singing it.  The CD also has great hits like \\"Whole lotta Love\\", \\"What is and what should never Be\\", & \\"Living Loving Maid (she's just a woman)\\".  Worth the price.
B00004STUL|2.0|Nothing unique or original here. The family man cop and the loose canon ladies man cop bust the drug kingpin.A weak story with lots of over-the-top unrealistic gun fights.I expected some Profanity but when there is so much and it is used with such abandon, it becomes pointless. The rest of the dialog is composed of poorly done \\"ghetto english\\". 2 stars for the good photography work of Miami.
B000002IR7|5.0|I love this CD!!!  It transports me back to 1962 and I listen to the music of the Green Onions all of the time now.  I have it in my CD player in the car, and as far as I am concerned, this music is the absolute best way to usher in Summer of '07.
B00005RIKI|5.0|What else can I say about Van Zant and Co.?  Simply the best...
6305358567|5.0|Great movie, I could watch this movie many many times.  Too bad I gave it away.  Could you send me  another one?
1582701709|4.0|Its great, It is difficult to remain in that state of euphoric thoughts/feeling all the time.  I don't think/feel it is humanly possible to connect always in a positive state.  I learned to meditate more, I have bought the movie too.  I wished I would have bought the book and movie when Mrs. Hicks(Teachings of Abraham) was included. I felt she was very dynamic and added way more positive female voice to the movie(I only seen her in a underground \\"The Secret\\" movie released more than a year ago here in the states.)
B000002J5K|4.0|The CD is well done, however, I was searching for soundtrack from the movie that wasn't on this CD so I was a little disappointed.
B000JCETDS|5.0|If you love Tenacious D get this, if you love Jack Black and Kyle Gas get this, if you loved the movie, guess what...get this. This set has a cd with very funny songs on it, a mini poster which is great, 9 tarrot cards and the pick of destiny itself. I strongly recommended this for anyone who is a fan. I sure love it!!!
6303402348|5.0|My boys asked me for this.  They loved it.  It is on TV all of the time but they still wanted the video.
B00005QXDD|4.0|If you're a fan of the movie or of the band itself, complete your collection with this CD...has quite a bit of songs on it and the songs are catchy...but do not buy this for younger people...has alot of foul language.
B000AP04OM|5.0|This is a great movie and even better of the newer DVD technology.
6305364648|5.0|In this movie Arnold Schwarenegger is perfectly paired with Jaime Lee Curtis, and is a pleasure rewatch if one likes the genre.
B00000G3PA|4.0|The music, how it is cut and taken - has a good feeling about it.  One of those film I put on while I'm home doing something.  And it keep's me company.
0790729601|5.0|As Always Arnold Shines as a Hero, the premise is unusual, and the story most entertaining.
B000N3T0DW|5.0|Almodover always surprisses me, and this time was no different! Women in all the major roles, dense, human... The story gets complexity as the film goes, surprising the audience. Emotional. Best Almodovar ever!
B00005V1Y0|5.0|I love this movie and wanted to own it on DVD. Thank you.This is the original movie and absolutely wonderful!
B00007KWHG|5.0|This product was as advertized. Very good quality and received in a timely manner - We are very pleased with this CD
B00005JPCF|5.0|My eight year old grandson watched this ,over and over again and it certainly made him happy. It arrived quickly and in good condition. <br />Penny Smith
B000MV9026|5.0|It is wonderful to have a movie that is for the whole family.  My granddaughters were able to watch it unsupervised and without hesitation to any violence or vulgar language.  We definitely need more of these types of movies.
B00008BXJG|5.0|In my opinion this is the best of the AC/DC albums.  If you do not like all their music you will still find songs on this album you will enjoy.
B0001Z53CY|4.0|I got this CD because I like Eminem.  He did a good job with this group...  I like this CD a lot.
B000MGUZMU|5.0|I've read some reviews where they say the music in Funeral was better, but I disagree.  Neon Bible has some great arrangements, great melodies, pretty inventive instrumentation, it's good stuff.  If I can get a song stuck in my head and I don't mind that it's there, I like the song.  I like this whole album!  Easy recommendation.
1582701709|5.0|My review is impartial, and I found the book to be one of the best, even tho it is too short.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Less of a rainy-day feel to this album than to the Michigan album.  As always, Sufjan's song titles crack me up.  And then his music delights me and makes me laugh.  Sheesh, that sounds cheesy.  It's a good CD.
0060541792|5.0|I love the night light.  It's just enough light to avoid stubbing a toe.  Love the book too.
B0002IVN9W|4.0|Funeral is a good album.  The first word of the second song is my name, and I like that.  The music is fun and hefty-sounding, but all in all, if you have to get one Arcade Fire album, go with Neon Bible.
B000NA28IE|4.0|Fascinating documentary on the making of the movie and fantastic special effects.  If you've read the books you wont be disappointed, a must see for any fantasy buff.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|THIS WAS A GREAT WAY TO END THE SERIES.ROCKY WENT OUT HIS WAY AND THE WAY HE STARTED WITH HIS HEART AND DESIRE.
0938045695|4.0|Great book on the basics of Kettlebell training, and a lot of the info is essential for anyone wanting to get started the right way.  However, there was a bit too much filler in there.  When I'm looking for info on exercise and fitness a little of the history and hype is OK, but there is a lot of it in here which detracts a little from the overall message in my opinion. <br /> <br />I would suggest however that someone not try to just use the book to get started.  You might want to search out some of the \\"Minute of Strength\\" videos from \\"Art of Strength\\" on the internet.  They are short clips which demonstrate the proper way to do the exercises in the book.
B00000F14B|4.0|If you are a fan of Broadway musical comedies and dramas, you will love this reissue of The Music Man.  You do not need to be of a certain age to be thrilled with the performances by some of America's brightest stars of the 20th century.  Some may find the plot and characters a bit thin by today's standards; but, they still play well for a large audience.  This is not just an archive of ideal life in the 1800's.  The Music Man is a real testament to the American musical theater.  Robert Preston and Shirley Jones are wonderful; and, you'll love Ron Howard in his first movie.
B000002I6T|5.0|this is one of the classics from the early 70s
B000LAZDQA|4.0|The graphic gay and straight sexuality in this video was a real surprise.  I think its becoming a filmmaking trend to have real sex rather than acted out sexuality.  I watched it several times, not for the prurient interest but to actually discern what the real message, if any, is in this video.  <br /> <br />The idea of true intimacy and how to acheive it seems pervasive to the straight and gay couples in the video.  I actually found the best part of the disc to be the interviews with the director and the stars and their take on the sexuality, and their purposes for making the video.   <br /> <br />It is definitely a graphic celebration of the complications of acheiving human intimacy.  The comic relief is very nice, to take the edge of the sexuality. The Ashton Kutcher look alike was quite cute.  The subtle humorous scenarios were always a surprise. (A voyeuristic straight Secret Service agent monitoring the president's daughters during the day and peeping Tom at night on the gay guys across the courtyard for psychological analysis?  That was a stretch, among many!) <br /> <br />I'd recommend this video for viewing but only if one can handle graphic sexuality in its many forms.  Don't forget to watch the extras!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|It is just fantastic!

B000002L62|5.0|After releasing the landmark recording Holy Diver, the pressure was on for Dio to produce a follow-up that would do it justice. 1984's Last In Line was that album, perhaps not quite as perfect as it's predecessor but very close.     THE PACKAGING: Last in Line sports terrific cover art, with enslaved minions portrayed laboring in scene of ruin and destruction. The demon Murray (Dio's unofficial mascot) looms over the scene, his hands formed into Ronnie James Dio's trademark horns. Like most pre-CD jacket art, it was MUCH cooler on a 12-inch LP sleeve instead of these tiny CD jewel cases. There's not much to the liner notes, just a track listing, credits, and the chorus lyrics for the song \\"Last In Line\\".     THE BAND: The same lineup that recorded Holy Diver is featured here as well, with the rhythm section consisting of Vinny Appice on drums and Jimmy Bain on bass providing the foundation for the guitar histrionics of Vivian Campbell and powerful vocals courtesy of the great Ronnie James Dio. This core lineup is now augmented by keyboardist Claude Schnell, who was initially hired for the Holy Diver concert tour and wound up sticking around to record the next few albums.     THE SOUND: If anything the musicians sound even better than they did on Holy Diver. This band positively smokes, and the experience of playing live together night after night on the Holy Diver tour did wonderous things for their interaction as a group. Individually thay're great players; the tour turned them into a fully integrated machine. Guitarist Vivian Campbell plays with the same fire that characterised his Holy Diver performance, but with a refinement that speaks of greater maturity. Drummer Vinny Appice is powerful and dynamic, and bassist Jimmy Bain plays with his usual solidity and outdoes himself in terms of inventiveness; dig his bassline on the title track. RJD is in rare form, turning in one of the best vocal performances of his career. Although keyboards aren't heavily featured onthis album Claude Schnell actually manages to contribute quite a bit, adding texture to the songs in subtle ways. RJD himself serves as producer on this recording, and the experience he gained in recording Holy Diver shows through tremendously here, creating a much fuller and more balanced sound. I don't understand why so many reviewers are clamoring for a remaster; most remasters I've heard only serve to screw up great classic recordings.    THE SONGS: Like Holy Diver, Last In Line is simply jam-packed with classic tunes. Opening track \\"We Rock\\" certainly does, and it's immediately followed by the breathtaking title track, featuring arching chords and RJD's patented fantasy-fiction lyricism. It's one of Dio's best songs ever. The fast-paced \\"Breathless\\" is one of the weaker tracks featured here, but it's followed by the great hard rocker \\"I Speed At Night\\" and the mid-tempo stomper \\"One Night In The City\\", which is a great change of pace and finds RJD pursuing more real-world lyrical territory. \\"Evil Eyes\\" is next, another great fast rocker (this album is full of 'em) with some killer riffing from Vivian Campbell, and then comes \\"Mystery\\", a mysterious foray into pop-metal territory that somehow works. \\"Eat Your Heart Out\\" is the one true throwaway here; it's interesting but is ruined by an awful chorus. The album closes with a true classic, the slow and powerful epic \\"Egypt (The Chains Are On)\\". Another of Dio's top ten.     THE BOTTOM LINE: Seven killer songs, one average rocker and one stinker. You really can't ask for much more than that. It's not quite as good as Holy Diver, but then what is? You can't really go wrong with classic Dio, and this album is a real gem. Don't hesitate to pick it up.
B00005JLCI|5.0|There are two camps of Hamlet: the traditional one which is said to represent Shakespeare's intent, and the 'creative & modern' one, which imposes post-60s Western social perspective on a classic masterpiece.  The latter perversion is described by the Amazon synopsis. <br /> <br />Branagh's Hamlet is the only production since the 40s to accurately deliver Shakespeare's intent.  It portrays Hamlet realistically, as if any individual would have suffered such injustice: a murdered father, a fickle mother who weds the father's murderer not 30 days after his father is killed.  That murderer, his Uncle, ready to destroy his father's legacy and remove Hamlet's inheritance of the crown to add insult to injury.  Ophelia, his lover, is a tragic consequence - a confused woman who cannot cope with the reality dealt to her and Hamlet - such weakness, to not be able to put what is right and just over her own selfish needs for affection & love.  This eventually driving her mad, a poignant statement of how human weakness can let irrationality conquer the psyche; a constant reminder of how frail we are, and the enduring struggle to conquer our emotions. <br /> <br />The post-modern perversion would elevate Ophelia to the heroine status, instead of portraying her as the consequence of weakness and self-important love, while portraying Hamlet as a vengeful lunatic driven mad, instead of an understandably infuriated and clever harbinger of justice and righteousness. <br /> <br />The costumes and views are breathtaking, Branagh even using special film during the time of Laserdiscs for extra breadth and clarity. <br /> <br />This version of Hamlet is my favorite movie.  It will not disappoint you like Mel Gibson's travesty.
B000MNP2K8|3.0|I am an old die-hard Bond fan and still prefer Sean Connery out of all the Bonds.  I know some of the gadgets and gimmicks are goofy but Bond ain't supposed to cry. Anyway I bought this for my wife who loves it!!  I'll take Goldfinger or Diamonds are Forever anyday!  There were some awesome stunts in this movie and it was refreshing to know I could get most of the gadgets at Best Buy.
B00005AWMF|5.0|I got this because of one of the Songs \\"Love is stronger than pride\\" that got my curiosity, but the singer was disappointing and the songs too.  She sings like a robot and has no mentionable range.  I donated the cd to the local library.  The shipping and price were, as usual, perfect, no problem in that area.
0780626966|5.0|this is a very cool dvd collection,it is not to scary and it has some funny parts and the best thing about it is that you can watch one part right after the other without having to go buy the next one.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|I saw this series on a hi-def cable channel and thought the picture was really eye popping. I was kind of disappointed that it was narrated by Sigourney Weaver rather than Richard Attenborough, but when I got the HD-DVD discs, I was pleased to find that Sir Richard is the narrator. I have nothing against Sigourney's voice and she does a respectable job, but this type of content seems a perfect match for Richard Attenborough's narration. The image is great on my 720p Panasonic front projector displaying on a 96\\" diagonal widescreen. I'm using a Toshiba A2 HD-DVD player and as such, do not have the audio capabilities to take advantage of the Dolby Digital Plus output, since my receiver does not have HMDI inputs. I have an older Denon receiver and the audio is downconverted to DTS, but it sounds much better than standard DTS or DD. The sound is much fuller and richer with more dynamic range and visceral impact. It is really incredible, and I look forward to hearing the true hi-resolution content when I upgrade to one of the new Pioneer Elite receivers with HDMI 1.3 later this summer. I highly recommend this series for both stunning picture quality and outstanding audio.
B000N3STBQ|5.0|You already know the album...  you're probably interested in this for the documentary...  I know I was.  After the 30 minute affairs on the other disks, I was prepared for a pretty good movie given this amazing period in their history.  Well, the movie is an HOUR long, with a good mix of creative, business, studio, and Tour stories.
0743289684|5.0|This is a very informative book. It really opens your eyes to the struggles of women of the muslim faith and how oppresive it can be,but also shows how arrogant the men are. Ali is a strong woman and I applaud her for breaking free from Islam but did she really break free considering she has to move all the time and have body guards with her at all times. We here in America should be on our toes because the quickly spreading Islamic faith presents a real issue for freedom loving Americans!!
B00005JPCF|5.0|When this was in the theaters, I had a friend warn me that the sea lion scene would scare my 3-yr. old daughter too much.  Not whatsoever!  It didn't faze her one bit and she continued to watch and ADORE this movie.  It is consistantly in our DVD player and played more than any movie she has!  Absolutely a wonderful adorable movie!
B00006LI4S|2.0|While Dave Gilmour is as excellent as ever the concert is not very engaging. Maybe it's me that just doesn't like acoustic versions of classic rock but it just didn't do anything for me. God knows who the guy was that did the intro to comfortably numb - even I could sing better than that - maybe it was his Dad :-) <br />Overall, not bad but lots of the emotion in the music wasn't there for me.
B0000067L2|5.0|Ginger, Eric and Jack are the three wisemen of 60's rock and roll,  mostly because they made great music and survived the decade.  This is THE definitive psychedelic mind-trippin CD for anyone's 'hey I wanna listen to the true old school' collection.
074356619X|5.0|There are good uplifting books outthere, but this one is by far the best I have come accross, it is very simple, easy to understand, you can listen to it in your car and it helps you in your life to keep a focus. <br /> <br />If you have not improved your life is because you do not want to, this book will show you how and in a way that as you listen you will tell yourself, I knew this, I have done this, is it really a secret.
B000003C4K|1.0|Vocals are terrible, they are more like talking instead of singing. I'm selling the CD because it is so bad.
B000007UDC|5.0|I ageee to the fact that this records so much of what Elvis really was and still is.  And even though we could not help but to see his beautiful stage clothes and how great he wears them, and at times his sadness,   a more focus on his voice should be considered instead.  This is a great dvd and a must not only for Elvis fans but for anybody that likes good singing and music,all along he displayed a terrific and powerful voice plus the compliment of his backup singers and musicians did the rest for the total scenario.  Without a doubt the best entertainer that set foot on a stage ever.  A man that gave his voice and total soul on every performance.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Anyone who attended one of Madonna's Confessions Tour concerts - will truly appreciate the rush of adrenaline when you get to re-live the experience through this wonderful CD + DVD package.  If you haven't scene the concert, but wanted to you - this is your chance!
0618680004|4.0|What an eye opening book!  Though a bit wordy and repetitious ('god' knows the repetition on the other side is much greater!) I felt completely vindicated in my early skepticism.
B000NA2776|5.0|This review isn't about me or how much I know about music.  So I'm not going to tell you who this guy's influences are and who he sounds like, because really I don't know.  I'll just tell you that this is a GREAT CD.  To break it down, there are 4 BRILLIANT tracks (1 verging on masterpiece), 4 GREAT tracks, 3 GOOD tracks, and only 1 I didn't really care for.  The best CD I've purchased in a long time.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|Will Smith does an excellent job and it's a great family movie for all.
B000AP04OM|5.0|This is a wonderful movie portraying the life of the von Trapp family during WWII. The sound and visuals are stunning and the extra disc is packed full of great information. The extra disc also includes a marvelous back-story behind the production of the movie as well as the story of the real von Trapp family. Everyone must own this classic movie.
B000N6TX22|5.0|We thought it was a great movie & enjoyed watching it.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Bought this for my wife. She's always loved the story and had been wanting the DVD for a while. When the special edition came out, I grabbed it. The commentaries are great. The history of the story, the animation process, and the cast/crew is wonderful.
B000N3T0DW|4.0|Who can resist Penelope Cruz.  We enjoyed watching Penelope in action, but then who doesn't??? <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0060776757|5.0|Excellent book!, writen in anecdote format. The pictures alone are worth this book, you will not believe how beautiful they are. Written in a heart-warming and personal fashion. I would recommend this book to any music fan, for a u2 fan it is a must!!!!!!!!!
B000HEZF0E|4.0|Great video and sound I thopught it brought even more life to the movies. The only draw back is that the bonus stuff wasnt hd on the first 2 and even that was limited. Overall though its a must buy for any action fan.
1932100660|5.0|I am an RN and my husband was a life-long vegetarian when we got married. I was interested in nutrition but still a meat eater. The research in this book is so convincing that we decided for health reasons to become whole food Vegans. Without trying-after 3 months of this I lost aprox 12pds and felt a whole lot better. Had a very healthy baby on this diet 2 years later and still feeling good.  <br />If you want to loose weight and reduce risks for CANCER, HEART DISEASE, Type 2 DIABETES etc... READ THIS BOOK! It may save your life.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|brandi carlile's new album is even stronger than her impressive debut.The single,\\"the story\\" is anthemic and her vocal goes from delicate falsetto to a ragged wail. \\"Turpentine\\" is a gorgeous sad pop gem with a terrifically catchy chorus for audience sing a longs. MY Song sounds a bit U2 like to me, with ringing guitars and thudding bass and drums, building to a crashing crescendo. Lots of acoustic guitar, some violin, and a lovely piano ballad called \\"Wasted.\\" The production is very good, clean and simple. Cannonball is just an acoustic guitar and two voices singing a beautiful harmony and it sounds like they are in the room with you. The cello is a nice touch on \\"Downpour\\", it's rich timbre a great counterbalance to brandi's soaring vocal.
B0007M22TI|5.0|this DVD  has the  proof that a group of women can sing without screaming or screeching and still be fine entertainment
B000IHYY52|4.0|This Blu-ray DVD is a great test for your home theater system. It produces a copious amount of sounds to reveal your receiver and speaker system's dynamic range. The video quality is 1080i, but it is clear none the less.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|The music is great but the additional videos in this set really put it over the top. A really fantastic set for the Stevie Nicks fan.
B000A2H59M|5.0|I am very pleased with this imported CD; sounds exactly like the album I used to have!  However, one song name is misspelled (disappointing) -- \\"Hanook\\" Rubs It should be \\"Nanook\\" Rubs It.  Other than that, great!
B000H5U832|5.0|Started to watch - got distracted - then started over again - really good. <br />like it so well that I had purchased another one to give to my handicap <br />brother.  The music in it is something he would enjoy.
B000FTWB7G|3.0|There are at least a couple of good songs on this one, but the previous was better.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|This album hit me one time (and many times after that) when I was only half listening.  I suddenly had the uncanny sense that the music struck a perfect resonance in me.  The music sounds like it comes from as much me as from the artist.
B00005JPD0|4.0|After watching this film and thinking about it, I watched it a second time and wonder now what is the REAL thought behind this.  Here are my observations:<br /><br />1.  FBI guy wearing \\"past viewing helmet cam\\" at crime scene within a couple of hours of explosion.<br /><br />2.  Reference to Denzel's character having worked at the Oklahoma City bomb explosion  (Theory is that FBI knew in ADVANCE of that explosion)<br /><br />3.  FBI's super secret \\"past viewing\\" equipment only goes back to four days.  This means this had been collecting data from four days before the explosion.  And all that complex gear doesn't get set up in a few hours.  It would take weeks to set it up.  What a coincidence that it was set up in a city about to experience a huge \\"terrorist\\" event!<br /><br />4.  \\"Terrorist\\" character has same \\"profile\\" as Timothy McVey.  Loner, super \\"patriot\\", etc.  His comment at the end saying \\"It wasn't supposed to end this way\\" tells me someone had TOLD him how it would end.  He wasn't working alone.<br /><br />5.  Conclusion, this \\"attack\\" was a test.  It was known in advance. The FBI was ready for it.  They needed Denzel's Oklahoma City experience to see if he could solve the crime.  Next step, all major cities have this type of surviellence.<br /><br />So again I ask my question; \\"What is this film REALLY about?\\"<br /><br />This film is a combination of Minority Report, Max Headroom, Star Trek and Enemy of the State.  Of course the technology and the ending is a stretch but it makes for an thought provocking flick.  Denzel, as always, puts on a great show.
B000F3UAFC|3.0|I really enjoyed this film, primarily because Oscar Wilde was (is) a master of conversation.  However, I didn't realize the source of the screen play until I heard the name \\"Windemere\\" and then \\"Fan\\", when everything came clear that this was the Wilde play brought to the screen. But only a so-so effort. I thought the lead characters were poorly cast.  This doesn't mean they were poor actors, it just means they were not convincing in the parts.  Helen Hunt is usually funny and clever but doesn't strike me as a seductress or a \\"woman of the world\\".  The best and most believeable actors were the supporting cast, who unfortunately mumbled some of the better lines.  The Oscar Wilde play was a comedy of manners and a social commentary on the English upper class, but alas this was largely missing in the movie.  In fact, the pace and crispness of Wilde's wit was subdued due to the slow pace of the film.  However, this was still a fun movie, beautifully filmed and costumed.  I thoroughly enjoyed the film because even the flaws in this film couldn't destroy the superb wit and conversation that characterized Wilde's work.
074356619X|5.0|First off, let me just say that if you are looking for a get rich quick or lose 20 pounds in 10 days scenario then this is not for you.  While the idea of simply thinking good thoughts sounds very simple it is actually a lot harder than you can imagine.  As your old thinking patterns and life's little struggles get in the way of positive thoughts, keeping yourself tuned into a frequency of happiness and abundance is a difficult mental task.<br /><br />This is why I highly recommend the CD set over the book or the DVD.  Having the CD's gives me a quick and easy way to refocus my mind when negative energy starts to re-take my thinking.  The CDs always manage to inspire me to action and I am well on my way to achieving some of my life long goals.<br /><br />I do have 2 suggestions though... Spend the $5 to watch the video of the secret, one time only, online.  That way you can put a face with the voices from the CD.  And, for a more indepth explanation of the Law of Attraction purchase one of the original Law of Attraction books.  Michael Losier and Ester Hicks are the first 2 authors that come to mind.  Don't get me wrong, The Secret is a GREAT introduction to the Law of Attraction and VERY motivating.  But there is a little more to the process than The Secret offers so an additional book would really help solidify the concept.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|I recently discovered this series on the CBS website (now in Season 2) and was instantly hooked. I went ahead and purchased the Season 1 DVD and it's made me laugh out loud...REPEATEDLY. I knew Jason Segel, Alyson Hannigan and Neil Patrick Harris in other roles and LOVE them in the sit-com; they have great timing and delivery. Josh Radnor and Cobie Smulders were new to me but instantly likeable as well. The whole cast has such great chemistry together and I love that the characters of Lily and Marshall (Lilypad and Marshmallow) have a healthy, loving, fun and playful relationship. It's possible to have a happy couple be interesting. (I'm looking at you Grey's Anatomy--the whole Gizzie thing may be the final straw for me with this show. But I digress...) <br /> <br />I haven't even gotten to the Special Features yet, but the 22 episodes alone make this DVD worth every penny and then some. If you don't get the \\"high 5\\", \\"suit up\\" references in these reviews , see what all the fuss is about! :-)
B000JJSRNY|5.0|Top notch talent performing incredibly. This DVD is gorgeous listening. And Netrebko is always gorgeous watching!
B00004HYLF|5.0|My husband LOVES this album and didn't think it existed on CD anywhere.  He was SSOO happy to get it. We both are Chick Corea fans.
B00012QM8G|5.0|A must see film and in general one of the most powerful and influential movie's of our time. The shipping was fast and I am totally satisfied with my purchase.
B00005JLCI|5.0|Like Romeo & Juliet, the film versions of Hamlet have always been edited.  In Hamlet's case, greatly edited (from 4 hours down to less than 2 and a half hours.) <br /> <br />Kenneth Brannagh decided to film the entire play and the stars came to be a part of this great triumph.  Kenneth plays the meloncholy dane with the great Julie Christie as his mother and Alan Bates as his uncle. And an early Kate Winslet as the doomed Ophelia.  Plus cameos by Oscar winners Jack Lemmon, John Gielguld, Charleton Heston, John Mills, Robin Williams and Judy Dench.  Plus Billy Crystal, Gerrard Depardieu, Rufus Sewell, Rosemary Harris and Richard Attenborourgh. <br /> <br />This film was spectacularly made with sumptuous sets and costumes, beautifully photographed and edited. <br /> <br />I always say there is nothing better than well made Shakespeare and nothing worse than bad Shakespeare.  This is definitely well made.  This will be the quintessential version of Hamlet and is a must for all Shakespeare fans.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever in my opinion. The shipping was fast and I am very satisfied with my purchase, a great buy!
B000MGBSI0|5.0|This season is truly outstanding.  There are lots of twists and turns in this show - you'll never be bord. <br />I should also mention that I have watched all 8 discs, and they all played without any problems.  I will say, however, that discs 7 and 8 are grainy, especially disc 7.  It is really sad that these discs were not re-done.  In this day and age there is just no excuse to not fix a disc to superb quality.  After all, we are paying for these discs and we expect quality.
0790731509|5.0|This is a must see and must own movie. Any movie lover has to have this movie  in their collection. The shipping was fast and I am totally satisfied with my purchase. BUY THIS MOVIE!!!
0446677450|4.0|The book was easy to read, I bought one for myself and one for my 25 year old son.<br /><br />Rich Dad, Pood Dad, was a eye opener in many ways,it made me think differently/<br /><br />It was also great to be able to discuss the book with my own son.  We both learned something.
1582701709|5.0|The Secret really does work !!! Despite negative reviews I ordered it anyway. What a treasure !!! A life-changing book !
B00005R5G9|1.0|This is not the original, it is very tacky, and poorly done. We were disappointed in it
B000031XCR|5.0|This CD is chock full of Celine's greatest songs. It is a pleasure to listen to all the way through.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|I think everyone should see this. Man, woman, child, the elderly, etc. This shows how our planet is very bio-diverse and that we should do everything to preserve what we have right now.  This collections shows the beautiful things that exists in our world today.  And therefore, we should respect our environment and save the habitats of these animals-we're not the only ones that lives in this planet.
B00001QEE8|5.0|The shipping was great and what can you say about the movie other than perfect  thank you
B000E33VWW|4.0|The life of Truman Capote is amazingly portrayed with accuracy by Philip Seymour Hoffman. He wraps Capote's essence in a well-packaged gift for the audience. The genius of In Cold Blood boosted Capote to infinite fame, but at a price. That price and what leads up to it unfolds creatively, truthfully and dramatically. An eccentric man with an electric presence is surrounded by celebrities, but maintains individuality that stands out to this day. The film grabs an important piece of Capote's career and magnifies it for the viewer. A definite must-see.
B0000549B0|5.0|This is a classic I love Harvey and we were very pleased with everything  thank you
B000FVGMC4|5.0|I found out about Paolo on the web by sheer accident on YouTube. What an amazing soulful and mature voice he has, even at 19 (now 20). Other than Amos Lee and Martin Sexton and Stereophonics, I've not come across an artist recently  whose lyrics and command of his voice is so perfect. Paolo knows just what his scottish accent works best on. <br /> <br />I am distantly reminded of a young Rod Stewart, in the time of the Faces, way before he went mainstream pop and disco, and when he was a wee rocking lad.  <br /> <br />Saw him live in Seattle, frankly, his live stuff is way better (as good as this album is!!!). See the live stuff he's done on YouTube (the stuff his crew has released, not the cell phone concert tapings of 15 year olds) and you have to agree that Paolo is the best thing to come out of Scotland in years.  <br /> <br />Hint, the last track (Alloway Groove) is actually three songs, separated by about a minute or three of silence. At about 12:00 min into the song and after a few minutes of silence, suddenly you hear Paolo do an acoustic version of Last Request. Amazing.....
0765315246|4.0|If you are a fan of the pulp serials of the 50's and 60's this is a story for you.  Great escape in the \\"\\"young readers\\" tradition of \\"Glory Road\\" and \\"Starship Troopers\\".  Just the escape for those of us who were \\"young readers\\" back in the day and want to be so again.
0887307280|5.0|A great read.  It really helped me crystallize my vision for the future of my business.
B000MNP2K8|3.0|Running. Lots and lots of running. Craig spends much of the time throughout the film doing full-on windsprints across the screen chasing someone. As a standalone film, it was great. Good story, plot and all that. But not a classic Bond flick. No way. It lacked that bit of offbeat quirky Bond personality that we've seen in the past. No gizmo's and gadgets either. What happened to Q?. Craig is good.  Very athletic and limber and all that but really, too damn stiff and straight as a Bond.  No swagger.  His time with the babes (what there were of them) was almost uncomfortable to watch. Doesnt come across as a ladies man. I do admit that this film has one of the best footrrace chase scenes I've ever seen. Awesum!! This was more or less like watching another Mission Impossible sequel. Lots of action packed this and that,stuff blowing up and all but missing the true signiture of Bond. James Bond. They didn't even get his favorite martini right either. I think someone is trying (yet again) to rewrite, rework and rebuild the Bond we all grew up with. Leave it alone. Stop trying to make whats perfect \\"even better and more exciting\\". You'll only succeed by screwing up a legend. Another Bond film like Casino Royal will do it.  Hollywood always thinks its the expert. Not this time.
B000K7VHQE|2.0|Maybe good for younger audiences but not worth the watch for anyone else Or for me anyway.
B000N3SS80|4.0|Loved this CD.  I don't speak Spanish, but after hearing it once, I had to have it, and I'm not disappointed. Lovely voice, good music, super latin beat...all combine to make a great CD!!
B000HEWEE4|4.0|Good movie although a bit redundent with the mailbox. Stars were awesome, can never go wrong with those two.
1416909532|5.0|I purchased this book for my 16 year-old daughter.  It gives good, common sense advise about men.  It talks about how you are a great person and don't deserve someone who treats you poorly.  There are examples of being treated poorly and the excuses that some women use to justify the behavior.  One warning though:  there are a few \\"bad words\\" in there; however, in my case, the good of the content far outweighed the bad words.
B00005JPGO|5.0|Great movie that gives a dose of reality along with the ruthlessness of those farming diamonds.
B000MNP2K8|5.0|This is the best Bond movie ever.!!! It will make you wanna watch it again and again.
B000NA28IE|5.0|great show of good over evil. Awesome graphics and great setup for a second movie.
0679746048|5.0|At the age of 17, in the summer of 1972, I was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric ward at a local hospital. My original diagnosis was OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder)--which I understood not at all. I thought I was being punished for dropping out of school and refusing to socialize with anyone!<br /><br />So I can totally relate to Susanna and the other girls in this wonderful book. It sounds so much like the months (not years, thankfully!) that I spent in that first hospital. (Yes, there were more later). I can relate so vividly to being with a group of young women--still in their teens--sharing a ward, trying to outwit the doctors and nurses, trying to understand why we were locked up on beautiful summer afternoons while our old friends were all out dating, going to parties, preparing for a future we never felt we would have.<br /><br />I don't know how an \\"outsider\\" would react to this book (and the movie that followed)--I just know that for me, it was like taking a long look back into my own adolescence. It was a kind of affirmation, somehow, for me that my time since then hasn't been totally wasted. It makes me feel less strange to know that others have gone thru the same thing.<br /><br />If you are fortunate enough never to have spent time in a mental hospital, if you were blessed with \\"good\\" mental health, this is an eye-opening glimpse into what that world is like--or what it WAS like, before mental patients were allowed only days inside (at most) thanks to draconian insurance laws and \\"deinstitutionalization\\".<br /><br />Kaysen tells her story in almost unbearably tender yet unsentimental prose. You feel for her, as you do for all her fellow patients....even for some of the doctors and nurses. You see how difficult just making it from one day to the next is for someone diagnosed \\"mentally ill\\".<br /><br />Susanna Kaysen, thank you for this wonderful book.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Celtic Woman - A New Journey: Live at Slane Castle (2007)<br /><br />I challenge you to watch /listen to this DVD without tapping your foot or nodding your head in rhythm to the music.  It is just one of those things.  The Celtic Women don't hurt your eyeballs to watch either.<br /><br />I have given their CD's to two people so far and will probably do so again.  They make excellent gifts.  I'd give the DVD's but the CD's are cheaper.<br /><br />Gunner  May,2007
1400103282|5.0|A great story of an intelligent & inquisitive person who's interests led to an amalgum of different skill sets that resulted, literally, in a machine (and culture) that changed the world.  <br /> <br />This story is reminiscent of 'Surely you're joking mister Feynman', another remarkable man
B000JJSRNY|5.0|My DVD collection is now quite extensive and I give away some that I won't return to, but this concert is so good that I watched it twice in two days. It has earned a place on my \\"to keep\\" shelf. First of all, the filming and the sound are excellent and you almost feel that you are there, in the best seats, of course. Placido Domingo, gray hair and all, still has his powerful voice and real star presence. He sings with two of the greatest current vocal greats, Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazon, in a beautifully chosen and most enjoyable repertoire. The orchestra is a good match for the three stars in quality. You won't regret acquiring this DVD. It is an outstanding concert and perhaps there won't be that many more with Placido Domingo singing, rather than conducting,as he does more and more often these days. Highly recommended!
B00005JPGO|5.0|So sad that this type of thing goes on.  The story was delivered very nicely, awareness should be raised through this story.
B000HC2LI0|4.0|Having ordered a number of DVD's from Amazon over the last few years, all of which I have been impressed with - The West Wing tops the lot, superb packaging and brilliant content. <br /> <br />Sadly, other items did not play on UK players and needed to be returned. Can Amazon please check the geograhical ability before advertising products. Otherwise the service is great <br />Regards <br />Jim Smith
B000GW8RX4|5.0|I used to have the \\"Rainbow On Stage\\" cassette years ago, and this DVD is from the same tour, I think. Blackmore, Dio, Powell, Daisley and Stone round out this power lineup. Things get rolling in a hurry with an awesome version of \\"Kill the King\\". I recently purchased Deep Purple \\"California Jam '74\\" and Blackmore's style is rather similar on this performance. He even destroys his guitar at the end. It's rather frightening how fast his destroyed guitar, hanging by the cord, gets spinning as he repeatedly smashes it on the stage, about 3 feet from the first row of fans, as he then flings it into the audience again. Yowch! <br /> <br />But back to the music! Ronnie Dio is amazing. Him and Blackmore made one heck of a charismatic and talented guitar/vocal attack. Cozy's thundering double bass drum assault pounds through the speakers, as Daisley and Stone thicken up the mix with the nice bass/keyboard addition. <br /> <br />The song selection is great, and, as always, there is plenty of soloing and jamming, which extend the length of the songs, but that's part of what Deep Purple and Rainbow have always been about live. <br /> <br />I love all the Deep Purple and Rainbow lineups...they all are unique and  wonderful. If you do too, you must buy this. The DTS 5.1 sound mix just smokes! Crank it up, for crying out loud! The price is unbeatable as well. What in the world are you waiting for? All you young kids out there should get this, and you'll see why some of the best rock music came out of the 1960s and 1970s. Bands today just don't have mastery of their instruments, or the songwriting ability like the classic artists. Unfortunately, bands this charismatic and talented are a fast dying breed. Buy this and see these guys in their prime!
1582701709|5.0|After reading 'The Secret' I was so impressed I bought several copies to give away as gifts. It revolves around the 'Law of Attraction' and the fact that thought has a frequency which attracts back like frequency. Thought patterns should be kept postive and on what we want, rather than on what we don't want. A very powerful message, and beautifully presented. <br />
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|Great the best I've heard in a long time. A+++++
B000N3ST9I|5.0|Buy it, is the only advise!! i have been a Head fan since 94-95 when BME blew my head away, loved TMTC, and then everything came down... until TTAOE, amazing album, i played it all the time (still do) and when i heard about The Blackening i was excited but also at the expectation because they might as well not match TTAOE. but everything was left behind after i listened to it. every song is amazing, really technical and complex, showing great musicianship and balance, great lyrics, robb shows a very strong and adaptable voice, great solos and complementing guitars, and bass & drums hard as stone. <br /> <br />only thing i did not like: i felt it was too short, i  wanted more!!! hey you have a 62 minutes album but think is too short? still want more? - thinking again it is a plus!! it leaves the taste in your mouth. <br /> <br />this is a no thinker! got to have it!
B000MRAAJM|4.0|Wow.  I'm not a huge nature show person, and I actually just bought this Blueray as a gift for someone else, but wow is it awesome to see in high definition.  I am NOT an HD expert, but I think the picture looks excellent.  I can see some faint grain (for split seconds) here and there, but overall the picture is crisp and the colors are livid.  Really stinks that all of the bonus footage on the DVD is not present in the Blueray edition, which is the only reason I rated this 4 stars instead of 5.  I would really have enjoyed watching that 3+ hour \\"making of\\" footage.
B000N6U0E2|4.0|This story was a great father-son story with great relationships and great values.  There was one part that was objectionable to me (when they were reading the graffiti on the wall), but I guess it was \\"reality\\" in the true story.  This movie was done well, and the acting was superb!
B0007VZ91C|4.0|It is a perfect CD for me when I am doing my relaxation an yoga. I am 73 years old and I do not like the modern music.
006112429X|5.0|The only fiction book I've ever started reading again as soon as I finished it the first time.  (Too many books to read them twice!)  Loved it.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Sit back, relax, and be prepared to be entertained by a great musical group.  The five lovely sopranos mesmerize you with their beautiful voices.  The young blond fiddler dances and fiddles all over the stage and is a definite show stealer.  Throw in the two drummers who keep the beat going, and you have a great DVD that you will enjoy again and again.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|OK, understand this. Bond not only is back, Bond has been reinvented.For the first time since Sean Connery initially exercised his license to kill, we have a Bond who looks as if he actually could run and shoot and climb and fight. Hell, he even bleeds and maintains a cut from scene to scene. Now, I enjoyed the Roger Moore/Pierce Brosnan years for what they were - \\"Wink,wink/Nudge, nudge\\" spywork. I even admit (under torture and after holding out for a looooooooooog time) to having seen the Lazenby Bond more than once ( and,though I saw Timothy Dalton do Bond , I have blocked the memory - hopefully for all time).  However, Daniel Craig is Bond in a way that should make Ian Fleming weep with pride while at the same time wondering a bit what facet of the more modern world has turned his Bond  colder and more introspective than he perhaps had intended. This is a Bond who glimpses who and what he is,and, under a facade of impenetrable indifference, would change it - if only the risk weren't so high.There is as much action as any fan could want, believable cars and weapons , realistic enough fights ( I wish , I wish, I wish that human heads actually could take that much of a licking and still keep ticking - all without much of a mark! Oh well! We have to suspend belief somewhere and walking away from a whupping is a better choice  than some invisible car). Besides Craig - and, let me say again,BRILLIANT casting- the rest of the movie is equally well cast . I'd work for Dame Judi anytime. You can see in this movie her understanding that , were she younger or James older.......... This film gets my ultimate endorsement for any series movie : I can't WAIT for the next one!
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|I love Celtic Woman, and this cd is my favorite so far. Plus the Bonus Tracks are some of my favorite from the concert at Slane Castle.
B0007VZ91C|5.0|So relaxing. Her voice is so beautiful! I can't wait to try other cd's by her.
B000NA2776|5.0|When I first heard Mika's first single Grace Kelly I fell in love with it. It is such a great song and he has a wonderful voice. I think right after that I pre-ordered this CD. I was really surprised that all the songs that are on Life in Cartoon Motion are as good as Grace Kelly. Mika is a talented musician as well as a great singer. If you like fun pop songs that are good to sing and dance to this CD is perfect.
B0000524CY|5.0|Warning: Do not watch it if you are under 19. Secondly, do not watch alone or nighttime, or before going to sleep. Very powerful movie that scares to death.
1582701709|5.0|if you have ever longed for a way to get out of the negative spirals that life can sometimes lead you into, then this is the book for you... if you have searched for anwers....then this book is for you... i have never felt so inspired, energized or hopeful... it lit a fire in my soul... READ THIS BOOK...
B000051VWW|5.0|I have enjoyed Sade's music since the early 1980's and have enjoyed it ever since! Every song takes me down memory lane and echoes of those long forgotten lounge singer's of the 1940's-50's. If asked which is my favorite I can highly recommend BY YOUR SIDE. A powerfully moving title of the greatest sense of TRUE LOVE that today's music is sorely missing.
B000059LGC|5.0|If you enjoyed Murder on the Orient express, here is the partner to that. <br />Another Classic Mystery for those great Mystery Buffs.
0618680004|4.0|Atheism seems such a dull subject (even for an atheist like me) but I was pleasantly surprised at how engrossing this book was.  At times hysterical and sad, I couldn't put this book down till I had read it from cover to cover.<br /><br />My only complaints are these, 1. he gives to little to no advice to parents trying to raise objective thinking children, and, 2.  he pooh poohs the justified fears of parents that child molestors are around every corner.  They are around every corner, as are crazy fundy wingnuts, both are dangerous to civilization as a whole.<br /><br />Other than that, I enjoyed the book enough to read it again someday, high praise indeed from me!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Al Gore brought it home to all of us who have been blind and ignorant to global warming.  I am going to do my part by (a) sharing my DVD with friends and family, (b) start following the advice given to help Mother Earth.  I think if we all do a bit every day to improve our habits and help the environment, perhaps we can reverse this impending tragedy which none of us want to experience.
B000GCFO0I|4.0|Well for starters, you have to love the game first before you even like this movie and before you even begin to watch it to understand it all. If you haven't, more than likely, you will not like this movie. I have yet, not met one person who hasn't played the Playstaion game yet and not like the movie. To me, this is one of the best Playstation games turn to movies by far, it has played right down to the music and the darkness of the game it self all the way to its disturbing creepiness. <br />The only down side is that yes, the movie is a tad too dark and sometimes makes it hard to see the \\"monsters\\" and what not, however, thats how the game is played and wasn't really that big of a deal for me. But, the story was decent, the acting was so-so and not a lot of gore within the movie as you would see in the game, but, still not a huge deal. Anyways, if you are a fan of the game, you will truly like the movie. Recommended !

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Until a recent run on Universal, I was unaware of this series and am still in mourning to find it was cancelled over 3 years ago. Planets seldom align to offer a gift like this - the concept, stories and character development are rich and satisfying. If you relate to the struggle for an ideal and enjoy a sci-fi western venue, you'll want this in your collection. It's time for a Serenity sequel.

Just fantastic, I was in my late teens when I bought the record and it was pretty well worn out when my record player went the way of the Dodo, now I have all the tracks and some extras on CD and its being well played again. Thanks David.

B00004VVNB|3.0|Can be considered a good movie in the 80s but special effect is too dated. I felt that the fashion sense is stylish though some people may disagree. The transportation and gun look fake. Still watchable but cannot compared to modern science fiction movie.

0743496728|5.0|Once again Jodi Picoult has written a spell binding novel!  From the first  <br />page to the action packed conclusion (again with an amazing twist) your  <br />attention is held with her non stop twists and turns that only a talented writer can crate. <br />I have read all her books and feel that \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" is truly one of her best.

B000HC2LI0|5.0|This box set tops it all. Carefully designed and well thought, just as \\"The West Wing\\" series is. I recommend this to everybody who wants to own a masterpiece of television.
0765316978|4.0|You know, I've been reading genre fiction for so many years that I was glad to hear that Scalzi was putting the hammer down on this franchise. Too many series of books have morphed into gradually withering franchises. Let me click off a few names for you: Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind, Anne McCaffrey, Piers Anthony... groaning yet? You should be. Remember those untold weekends and nights spent delving into yet another installment that does nothing and goes nowhere, finding yourself hoping for an entire *novel* that gives you some sense of overall narrative progression? I sure do. And it sounds like Scalzi does too.<br /><br />I think what he does best in TLC is weave a dense, twisting plot that is nevertheless pretty easy to follow and enjoy. There may be a few too many \\"You need to take a look at this, Bob\\" moments, but such are the trappings of the page-turner style, which Scalzi has nailed. I also like the multi-cultural nature of it, and the struggle of honest people against a sometimes cold bureaucracy.<br /><br />The dialog is also some of the snappiest I've ever read -- sometimes *too* snappy, in my personal opinion. Oftentimes the characters sound too glib for the circumstances. He doesn't quite nail the tone of gallows humor, and it can be a little jarring in the often grim circumstances that surround these people. Sometimes I felt that he was slipping in humorous exchanges for their own sake, and our protagonist sometimes came off like a riffing Tim Allen. It's good to see a writer obviously enjoying his work and his life, but the lightness granted by some of the exchanges killed the tension a few times. The snappy retorts and and dry sarcasm are entertaining, but they're also at odds with a grounded, serious conflict.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I recommend it. At the least, it's a skillful reminder of the importance of questioning authority and sometimes going against it in favor of moral obligation.
B000001EHS|5.0|Def Leppard rocks! All of the songs on this cd are past hits that will have you rocking all night long.
B000O75F7C|5.0|In many ways, Fear of a Blank Planet functions as a parameter to its predecessors, bravely quoting some key themes in order to retain stylistic cohesion. But at the same time, it is also an excellent chronicle of Porcupine Tree's entire body of work, as it is a lot more informed by their spacey, ambient rock leanings, which they have strategically placed into their songcraft. It is considerably less heavy than Deadwing and In Absentia, but the compositions are still nihilistic in tone and carry similar thematic ideas.<br /><br />Unlike the previous two albums though, Fear of a Blank Planet seems rather uneventful upon the first set of spins, with few or no hooks to speak of. Only patient listens reveal the successful blend of their strongest yet somewhat less accessible parts of their earlier work, initially bringing the listener's focus on the mindblowing performance of Gavin Harrison. This is easily his most realized work; the drumming is uniformly superb, and it is his playing that makes the most vital turns in the music. His full tone, powerful toms, and natural hi-hat taps are stunning to say the least.<br /><br />Themes of both In Absentia and Deadwing crop up on the CD, namely the main riff of the latter on the title track, a terrific blend of everything that makes Porcupine Tree the amazing band they are. Harrison's encircling snare drums slowly disappear under Steven Wilson's visionary songwriting, introducing the subject matter which gives us an insight into the psyche of a demented kid, devastated by the negative effects of technology, isolation, prescribed drugs, and the generation gap between parents and children. The middle section of the song boasts a nice spacey breakdown where airy synths float across the piece -- Richard Barbieri is absolutely essential to creating this band's sound. Even during the most subtle parts, he lays down a great sonic path for the music to travel on. I also love how he always establishes context for his amazing futuristic sound effects, carefully built around Wilson's acoustic and electric leads.<br /><br />The apotheosis of the album is \\"Anesthetize\\". At over seventeen minutes, it moves from mood to mood in order to help portray the character's restlessness, and also sees a guest appearance by Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson. His soloing on this song is out of this world, recalling his finest moments circa Power Windows. This could be his longest recorded solo in years as well. At one point, the piece erupts into a volcanic outburst thanks to the rhythm onslaught by Colin Edward and Gavin Harrison. Steven Wilson's riffing is intense not to mention his plaintive singing in the final section of the song.<br /><br />An excerpt from In Absentia's \\"Trains\\" resurfaces on \\"Sentimental\\", a largely piano-based piece of pop splendour; the smooth transition from the repeated acoustic guitar to said melody is awe-inspiring. Likewise, \\"My Ashes\\", easily among the darkest songs Wilson has penned, is predominantly acoustic guitar-based, but what cannot go unmentioned is the inspired symphonic orchestration.<br /><br />King Crimson's Robert Fripp appears on \\"Way Out of Here\\", the only song written by the entire band on this disc. Fripp's trademark \\"soundscape guitars\\" are vastly abundant here, defining the song's eclectic flow. The slightly industrial-tinged feel is replaced by machinegun riffery, and the bass works perfectly under Wilson's godly vocal harmony. For more stuff in this vein, only more electronic and experimental, check out Steven Wilson's No-Man project, which also has Robert Fripp on some albums. \\"Sleep Together\\" further expands on this style, minimising the heaviness factor. It sees processed vocals a la Frost and wonderful string arrangements by Dave Stewart.<br /><br />The production is flawless. Steven Wilson has reached the height of his powers; it is sternly disciplined yet rigorously simple at times, particularly during the raucous jamming sections. The recording and stereo mixing is amazing with emphatic surround channels, clever left-right speaker panning, and monstrous dynamics.<br /><br />Is it Porcupine Tree's best? Perhaps not. But we've heard it only for a month, not years, so who knows?els, clever left-right speaker panning, and monstrous dynamics.     Is it Porcupine Tree's best? Perhaps not. But we've heard it only for a month, not years, so who knows?
B00004Y6OA|5.0|I shouldn't have to convince anyone of the musical genius that is Van Halen. The music on this CD will stand the test of time, and will never lose it's value to those who appreciate rock.If you don't have this, you should. You will have made a wise choice.Feel good about that.
B00005JPAO|5.0|I saw this movie after Helen Mirren won the Oscar for Best Actress, and wanted to see it to find out if she had been that good so as to have won it. All I have to say is that she's so good you forget she is Helen and believe she's Queen Elizabeth II. Unbelievable performance. I wasn't a QE2 fan but after watching the movie I felt empathy for her and understood the reasons behind her stearness and her character.
B00005JPFH|2.0|What's good: that black gloppy stuff. Some good CGI there, and up to usual standards in the web-slinging and -swinging.<br /><br />What's not: pretty much everythinng else. Dialog like \\"I like being bad,\\" professional and amorous jealousies that an eight-grader would find puerile, and a positively painful attempt by Mr. Parker to act as the black glop recommends.<br /><br />I like comic book movies, some of them, and I liked the earlier Spiderman movies.

0307346609|2.0|If you're a fan of the zombie genre then you'll love Max Brooks' World War Z.  If you're not a fan (or find the concept of zombies mildly entertaining) then you'll most likely find this book a plodding drag.<br /><br />There are two key problems with Z.  Number one, Brook's has chosen to write the novel as a series of vignettes with a reporter interviewing a variety of people across the world.  A couple of the stories are enjoyable and given the page space to fully be told (the rogue Chinese sub, the pilot behind enemy lines, the Battle of Yonkers) but many seem like \\"filler\\" and don't add much to the overall book.  Characterization is non-existant due to the confines of the format.<br /><br />The number two problem with this novel is the length.  At 347 pages it's far too long.  If the meandering sections were removed you could have a tight 250 page novel that would have really moved.  But when your novel doesn't deal with characters, dialogue, or plot (beyond fighting the living dead) then every page feels like an eternity.  At times I felt like I was reading at a Zombie's Pace.<br /><br />So before everyone drags me out to be shot in the street Romero-style, I'll just say that I can see a Zombie Genre Fan giving this 5-stars and while it's not horrible, it's still just worth an average 2-star rating.

B0000C9ZSV|4.0|STRAIGHT OUT, I CAN NEVER GET ENOUGH JIMI, ESPECIALLY LIVE JIMI!  Jimi was one of the greatest musicians of the 20th Century and the 21st for that matter.  His creativity was limitless and just when you think he couldn't invent any more tones to his guitar, he does.  I have alot of live Jimi CDs and LPs and I listen to them all.  Why?  Because Jimi never stopped re-inventing his material on stage.  Every version of \\"Voodoo Child\\" is something special from the studio version on \\"Electic Ladyland\\" to \\"BBC Sessions\\" to The Royal Albert Hall to Woodstock to Berkeley, etc., etc., etc.  Jimi never let his audience down (well...except for the few times he stormed off stage in a huff...my mother saw that at Anaheim Convention Center on Feb. 9, 1968).  Listen to the short little rockabilly riff he plays right in the middle \\"Voodoo Child\\" on this CD and then to top it off he completes the songs coda by reprising the intro riff...the first time I've ever heard him do that.  Jimi was in fine form on this night!  He works one song right into the next but still leaves room for his off the wall stage patter he was known for (\\"yeah we'd like to dedicate this next one to the girl back there with the red underwear on, the one with the metallic knee caps\\").  If anyone was having a bit of trouble in the band that night, it seemed to be drummer Mitch Mitchel.  I counted twice where Mitch looses control of the beat and confuses Jimi and Billy briefly.  The big Boo-Boo you'll hear in \\"Pass It On.\\"  But with that small nick aside, this CD is another great document of a great Jimi Hendrix concert.
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|excellent watch. great looking. would be even better if it had date.
B000001ELR|5.0|This is easily KISS's best studio album, ever.  It is obvious who they are showcasing here.........ERIC CARR! Precise, intricate, thunderous drumming.  From the \\"Immigrant Song\\" influenced \\"Creatures of the Night\\", to the simultaneously played bass drums on \\"I Love It Loud\\".  There are no fillers.  And yes, Ace is not on the album.  But the session players <br />captured Ace's groove.  Even Vinnie is holding back.  Ever listen to his (Vinnie's) soloing on his Invasion albums?  He sounds like a madman hyped up on caffiene.  Not on this album however. All the solo's are tastefully executed. It just might be Ace. Just stare at that great album cover and think of the glory days.  It is Ace.  <br /> <br />The production is second to none. Thick, heavy, ambient drums. Like your playing in an empty gymnasium. THUNDER GOD! Who wouldn't want that!  That is, if your into heavy, hard rock. Peter Criss could have never pulled this off.   <br /> <br />I consider myself a Kiss fan through thick n' thin (at least up to Crazy Nights).  Whether it's the poppy melodies of Unmasked,or the concept album, Music From The Elder, Creatures is by far their most sonically sound endeavor.
B000002H92|5.0|This is as close to a live performance as you can get!
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I found this album a few years after the fact but I'm glad I found it when I did. It's a great soundtrack for anyone who isn't blind to the negative energy generated by everyday life -- for anyone who feels lost, confused, but not completely hopeless. Tunnels is the most euphoric song I've heard recently, Power Out rages with intensity, and Wake Up might just be the most emotionally-stirring song I've ever heard. Even the slow songs are captivating. Never a dull moment on this one! <br /> <br />Basically I agree with all of the other positive reviews on here. Arcade Fire have to be heard to be believed, and if you get the chance to see them live... DO IT!
0618680004|4.0|This book by Dr.Richard Dawkins, an Oxford biologist, has raised many hackles amongst theists. The main thrust of the book is the supreme improbability of a personal God overseeing the Universe. Additionally, Dawkins shows that religion is not only irrational but very harmful to the world and its people. He takes umbrage at scientists who try to use science to fortify their belief in God. For him, science and God are two diametrically opposite, incompatible views. You have to choose one over the other rather than do science during the week and go to church on weekends.<br /><br />I found the book fascinating and hard-hitting and offering a lot of food for thought. A must read for all inquisitive people.
B000I5X81K|1.0|This is the best CD of Josh Groban so far, his Awake concert tour is also great.
0895260131|3.0|I just finished this book, and I think it's worth reading as a balance to a great many works out there which are slanted in the other direction (ie: \\"Christians bad - Muslims good, yada, yada). I'm not a scholar on any of the subjects Spencer covers here, so I will allow that he might not be 100% right on every point. After reading many of the other reviews here, I'm convinced that many of these folks have not read the book at all. Spencer certainly has serious misgivings about Islam and, yes, I think one could call him \\"biased\\" to some extent. But what's wrong with that? I personally don't believe there is any such thing as a completely unbiased scholar, so I just try to get my information from multiple sources (this is the 3rd book on Islam I've read this year). That's why I bought this book - to get another view - one that is not heard much in our ever increasingly PC world. Why do some reviewers have such a problem with that? Some seem to think that only one view is valid (theirs), and that Spencer should not be allowed to enter the debate at all. If you believe some of these reviewers, anyone who says anything positive about this book is just one step away from picking up a sniper rifle and heading over to the nearest mosque. What condescending idiocy is that? I'm not a \\"hater\\", or a \\"bigot\\" or a \\"narrow-minded zealot\\", just a seeker of multiple points of view. That used to be called being \\"liberal\\". <br />I was particularly amused by one typical negative review written by Ms. Martie D. Kelley. It sounds to me that she's more biased than Robert Spencer, just in the other direction. Kelley trumpets her \\"higher education\\"  and  status as a \\"scholar\\" holding a BA in Religious Studies (doesn't say from where), but Robert Spencer holds an MA (that's a master's degree, Martie!) in Religious Studies from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and has been researching and writing on the subject of Islamic theology, law, and history for 27 years! So, by any objective standard, Spencer is a scholar, and he deserves to say his piece without being labeled a bigot! If he's wrong about something, then let's hear the counter argument - not dismissive insults. The only bit of evidence Ms. Kelley offers to show that Spencer is wrong is the laughable assertion that, \\"in the Qur'an it is explicitly stated that it is the duty of Muslims to protect People of the Book (Jews & Christians)\\" Now why does this tidbit come as no comfort to me? Would Ms. Kelley defend a male chauvinist who says that patriarchy states that it is the duty of every man to \\"protect\\" women? I doubt it. If Ms. Kelley had bothered to do more than just \\"skim through various parts\\" of Mr. Spencer's book, she would have realized that this inane comment plays right into one of the more salient points Spencer talks about in his section on Dhimma (chapter 4). The Muslim idea of \\"protection\\" of non-muslims is a far cry from what most Westerners know as religious tolerance and freedom of worship. It's more like how the Mafia dons used to describe shaking down the store owners in the neighborhood. \\"We're not taking their money and making them live in abject fear. No, we're just offering these good people 'protection'. There's no injustice going on here\\". Tell me, Ms. Kelley, just who should the other \\"people of the Book\\" be protected from, hmmm?  I'm also wondering what kind of comfort and assurance Ms. Kelley would offer to a Hindu, Buddhist or an Animist (or any other person not \\"of the Book\\") because as Spencer points out, these people have been regarded as no better than animals by Muslims. How can any intellectually honest person make such excuses for a religious system that claims to be religiously tolerant, yet is so narrowly selective in it's tolerance?  It just amazes me how far some \\"educated\\" people will go to defend the indefensible. Is Ms. Kelley saying that we need not be concerned about how the other religious groups are treated by Muslims as long as the Christians and Jews are \\"protected\\" (whatever that means)??? <br />This book might not be the last word on Islam, but it is worth a read, and I think Spencer is bringing some good points to a very important contemporary debate. I recommend the book but, by all means, keep reading and decide for yourself.
B000H30B2C|2.0|Sheessshhhh!!!! Just how mindless, pointless, stupid, and totally overrated can a movie be anyway? <br /> <br />This motion picture, \\"King Kong,\\" features a group of explorers who go to this island, kill some villagers there, and then kidnap this poor, love-struck, innocent, giant gorilla, bring it to their city and then shoot it to death. How merciless! You'd think they'd at LEAST let Mr. Kong have a weapon of his own with which to defend himself. Anyway, you get to sit through all this mindless nonsense for a whopping 3 hours or so. Furthermore, this pile of gorilla droppings had even managed to win an Academy Award (just how much money DO those things cost anyway??). Adding insult to injury, it even gets a special three-disc deluxe edition release from the studio combined with a special HD-DVD release from Microsoft. The filmmakers, the Academy, Microsoft, the IDMb users (Hint: if THEY like it, then you know it's going to stink), the studio that released it, and all else who are promoting this junk ought to be attacked by a herd of giant gorillas armed with bulletproof suits and highly advanced machine guns. I wonder how THEY would like it?

B00005JPGO|4.0|Violent movie that shows faithfully the reality of diamond traffic in Africa but also the use of young kids as deadly weapons, trained with kalashnikovs to slay everybody in targeted villages. <br /> <br />Leonardo di Caprio shows a great performance : completely mutated into afrikaner with attitude, accent, ...).  <br /> <br />Strongly recommended.
B000M5AJQS|2.0|I saw this motion picture, 'The Departed,' about a month ago at our Union theater for free (thankfully) and all I can say is... \\"Wow, I'm impressed!\\" Impressed with, not the movie itself, but with how arrogantly lofty its ratings are. There are five types of viewers who will absolutely adore this movie to the point of sleeping with it underneath their pillows every night while in bed: viewers who love watching other individuals get their heads blown off, followed immediately by the gushing of blood leaking and pouring out of the same location; viewers who are sick and tired of so-called \\"happy\\" resolutions (trust me, you definitely won't find one of those here so you should be okay); viewers who try to stay away from any movie of less than 2 hours; viewers who enjoy excessive amounts of pointless violence; and finally, viewers who are intolerable movies being \\"predictable.\\" If you are seeing this movie for the first time, and you are trying to figure out what will happen next, then 9 times out of 10, your guess may be less than accurate. I have read enough movie reviews to know what kind of movie will be well-perceived by the public and what kind will be treated like some kind of dangerous black mold or toxic waste; but as for the writer of this review, I personally could care less about any of the five aforementioned categories, so in that sense, I have to stay neutral. The students with whom I saw this film absolutely fell in love with it. My mother and her male friend, on the other hand, saw it months earlier and they didn't seem to think it was all that, and after all the great things that I had heard and read about it, I wondered why, but now I think I have a pretty good idea.  <br /> <br />As for the leading performers themselves, well, I had always wondered what it might be like to see Matt Damon and Leonardo di Caprio in a movie together, which actually, was the main reason that I had had any interest in seeing it at all. The former does a pretty good job with his character and at no point in the film does he ever appear as if he was reading off a cue card, or some nonsense like that, even though personally, I liked him better in 'Ocean's Eleven.' As for the latter, he, too, delivers a stellar presentation, especially in the scene where he's getting his already-injured hand smashed, banged up against a table, and then beaten with a shoe. Even Jack Nicholson comes through with a praiseworthy presentation with his character, even though I always thought that 'The Shining' was his landmark role.  <br /> <br />I definitely can't say that 'The Departed' is any where close to being my favorite movie. In fact, I can't even say that it is close to being in my Top 10, and it is certainly not one that I have any intention of buying anytime soon. On the other hand, I'll probably just rent it as it did have a couple of parts that actually tried to be good or make any sense. One thing that I have found is that a vast majority of viewers almost always fall into one or more of the five categories mentioned in paragrah # 1, so in that sense, it definitely won't have a tough time establishing a fan base who would equate it with some form of high-ranking personal status. To think that this actually won \\"Best Picture of 2006\\" award is enough to make you wonder just how far filmmakers went to bribe the Academy THIS time. There's been a lot of that going on in the past few years or so. Additionally, the movie can also be found somewhere on IMDb's Top 250 list (Who knows? Maybe I can bribe the staff members of that website to include a movie I like somewhere on that list, too.), for those readers who refuse to come into close contact with any motion picture that is not. However, if you are looking for a film that is not only on IMDb's Top 250 list, but is actually good, then I would suggest either 'The Shawshank Redemption' or either one of the 'Toy Story' movies as good places to start... and perhaps, even finish.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|Casino Royale is a return to the essence of James Bond : less gadgets and science fiction but much more action, plot, feelings, intensity, darkness.

Eckhart Tolle reveals the paradox of spiritual seeking (i.e. the one doing the seeking, the compulsive-thinking voice in the head that defines and relates all perceptions to the \\"little me\\", is the very thing that must be overcome for success). After reading this book, you will find yourself looking for the space between your thoughts; looking for the aware Presence from which all forms are born; looking for the  conscious awareness which is who you really are.  Tolle also refers to many of the sayings of Jesus which pointed to this state of Being, previously missed signposts, perhaps.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Joaquin Phoenix should also have won the Oscar for this moving. His part was far and away more difficult and accomplished far better than his co-star's. His voice, both spoken and singing, was absolutely astoundingly similar to Johnny Cash's. And his guitar playing was phenomenal. I believe Johnny himself would have been impressed. This is an excellent film with some insights into the inside of country music and its stars. However, it depicts June Cash as having had pre-marital six with Johnny Cash, which doesn't ring true with me, nor, I believe, did it ring with June Carter Cash's actual life experience. It's too bad when film-makers have to inject falsehoods to attempt to sell movies, especially when it didn't depict acurately Johnny's acute struggles with drugs. I suppose that part of his life was, perhaps, glossed over a bit to not tarnish his later life reputation and in deference to his death. Other than that, all in all, it was a good movie with an absolutely wonderful soundtrack. I did enjoy it a great deal.
B000E97X66|4.0|A good live CD from the early years. This is over 30 years old and some of the tunes are still classics, some I had never heard before. Real good recording quality
B000JLTRKE|2.0|Ultimately, the movie had little to do with 9/11 as it did with human persistence in the face of dire and tragic circumstances.  The disaster that trapped the heroes/victims could have just as easily been a mine collapse.  Thus, there were no insights into the 9/11 disaster other than the obvious ones, merely and briefly alluded to, that first responders were sorely prepared for it.  An altogether average film in the context of an extraordinary event.

It is written in a very light and accessible style, backed by facts, but not preachy. In fact, Michael Pollan never makes any recommendations to the reader on what type of diet he/she \\"should pursue.\\" My husband and I had already cut out most processed foods and sugar because of his diabetes, but I had not realized how contaminated the grocery store meats had become until reading this book. Reading the Omnivore's Dilemma has really inspired me to seek out<br />locally produced meat, eggs and to rely more on local farmer's markets for vegetables and fresh caught seafood from the local gulf.<br />A fascinating and well written volume that may cause even a fast food addict to consider some of his/her choices. :)<br />[[ASIN:B0007MVHUI A Secret Life Of Banjo]]

B000NA28I4|3.0|I really enjoyed the books but I didn't like this movie.  It was like trying to squeeze all of \\"The Lord of The Rings\\" into one short movie.  So much of the story was missed I just couldn't appreciate the movie at all.  I had an adventure reading the books I almost had a heart attack trying to watch this movie.  The animation was very good and the actors did a good job with what was left of the story and adventure of Eragon.
074356619X|5.0|I bought the audio book of The Secret and listen to it on my 45 minute commute to and from class.  It is inspiring in that it reminds you of all the good that is possible if you can only identify specifically what you want in life and then believe that you have already received it.  The key to keeping your mind focused positively is to 'remember to remember'.  It is all explained in the book and is easy to understand. It's a good read as well as a good listen!

B000ICL3KG|5.0|It is an undeniable fact, and a true rarity.  Al Gore has been a high government official with an impeccable security clearance, and yet he is an out-and-out granola-eating, spotted owl loving, tree hugger.  He brings good credentials to the eco-world, knowing first hand how big stakes politics work.  His on-screen presentation should do much to bring the people of the world up to speed on state-of-the-art thinking about global warming and the consequences we face on account of our willingness to stick our collective head into the sand and ignore the experts warning about what the future holds if we can't get our act together and take appropriate action. I recommend his on-screen presentation (based on his book) to everyone.

B000N6TX1I|5.0|This is not an evening's fun entertainment.  This is not light and fluffy. This is a film that will really upset some people and will cause people to get into heavy discussions.  The story, based on an excellent novel by PD James (not her usual English murder mystery stuff), takes place in a future when the population is in danger of dying out because there have been no babies born for about 20 years. The situaion is very bleak and anarchy is reigning supreme.  The discovery of a young pregnant woman leads a small group to attempt getting out of the country and out of harm's way.  Having been labelled \\"terrorists\\" by the authorities, the group are being dogged by everyone and in grave danger of being caught. Their journey is heart wrenching and frenetic and full of action. I cannot begin to tell about everything that happens because this film needs to be seen by EVERYBODY.  The cast is excellent-Clive Owen, Jullianne Moore, Michael Caine.  The cinematography is fabulous, much deserving of its Oscar.  You MUST see this film.  It will put something on your mind...and not let go.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|What can I say except that this film entertains exceedingly well. Action from beginning to end. Wonderful way to restart doing the James Bond films anew.

B0001CCXZW|5.0|For any fan and collector of the show, this is a must. I'll have to admit I had already bought the first five seasons before I bought the first and while the later episodes are great the first season sets the tone for the rest of the shows later. Who is going to forget Rory's first kiss, Richards first bout with angina and Loreli and Lukes chemestry, all all set up in the first season? In the pilot, however, it seems that Rory comes off a little darker than she does for the rest of the series and the extras on the last disk seems to have been added several seasons later, as in after the show has become a success.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|An excellent film well acted. Father and Son relationship enhanced by the actual relationship of Will Smith and his actual son playing his son in the film.

B00005JPCF|5.0|Loved the charm of the characters in this film and the story was delightful. One felt that they were real and could follow their trials and tribulations and eventual success even though knowing that they were not. The animation was well done and gave a feeling of the North Pole. The message wasn't too emphasised but nicely made so one felt that one should take notice of environmental aspects of this film without being forced to do so. The wonderful rhythms enhanced one's enjoyment to such a degree that one felt like tapping one's feet to the rhythm in the cinema.

So you see the package of this movie, it's about penguins, and you see that it won an Academy Award, sounds good right?  Nope, the movie was a huge disapointment and was completely politcally based.  I'm not against being ecologically minded, but I was surprised that the theme of the movie was environmental concerns and I wonder if that may be the reason of receiving an award.

1594200823|3.0|I cannot deny this is a valuable book.  As you have no doubt learned from a number of reviews, \\"Big Corn\\" has pervaded and transformed the contemporary American diet, with ramifications of all different kinds, and Pollan reveals this world that is hiding in plain sight all around us, and this is an important and valuable contribution. <br /> <br />    I could have made due, though, with just reading a review of it to get those basic facts.  I found Pollan's writing heavy-handed, preachy and judgmental.  His facts are strong enough to make his case, but he can't seem to resist going beyond them to suggestsions that make you question the rest of the book and left this reader, at least, distinctly dissatisfied.  His arguments about the economics of big corn, were, for example, often unpersuasive and sometimes contradictory.  No doubt some readers will enjoy this as one enjoys a political book from one's own political perspective, but it turned me off. <br /> <br />   Valuable, yes, but a chore to get through.  You can be educated by just reading reviews.
B000N6U0E2|4.0|This movie is very heartwarming.  Based on a true story it shows how far one can go if he is willing to make sacrifices in order to achieve his dreams.  It really is a nice family movie that shows that not everyone has a nice house to live in or a bed to sleep in.

Make sure to pay attention to the timeline.  There are several references to dates that if not noticed make the movie hard to follow.<br /><br />Over all I thought the movie was great and look forward to watching it again.

B000MNP2KI|4.0|In these times of innovation and reengineering, the modern myth of James Bond simply could not stand apart. And the final result has been a certain lack of good taste, accustomed refinement and a set of traditional issues we use to watch; the absence of a striking soundtrack that nourishes the action, the absence of the traditional opening with the figure of Bond looking us through a virtual eye, the presence of Money Penny, the new technological devices with the used spices of double sense occurences and  the accustomed black humor.<br /><br />The new Bond lacks of European flavor and persuasive seduction spirit. All the previous characters (with the only exception of Georges Lazenby of Australian origin and Pierce Brosnan from Ireland), were from U.K., even the handle of the elements of tension which introduced us to the main plot, were marvelous shot, with a mesmerizing kinetic energy.<br /><br />But this time, it seems the globalization has knocked at the door of this character, and well you know, a change has to come and turn around the state of things. Bond doesn't make use of his Aston Martin with all the lot of unthinkable special effects and hidden weapons we used to expect, the fabulous chases, with that so well elaborated dynamics.<br /><br />The forces of evil even have lost that arrogance and cynical behavior to become simple gangsters. There's an impressive lot of moving sequences, as the first human chase,for instance or the attempts of making Bond a viction of the violence, and lack of luminosity around the sinisters enemies who must conspire against the world peace are absent.<br /><br />Casino Royale has always been a turning point, a cordial and pleasant stop on the road, a divertimento, but taking into account this was the debut role of Daniel Craig, maybe this dare attempt to make to exploit the screen didn't result as sophisticated as one expected.  Although we must admit the solvency of the final sequence of the crumbling building.<br /><br />Perhaps in another opportunity,with a major emphasis on a more realistic script, (beacuse to my mind there are a lot of issues to explore) we'll keep in touch for the new entry.major emphasis on a more realistic script, (beacuse to my mind there are a lot of issues to explore) we'll keep in touch for the new entry.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|The first season of Supernatural is great.  The set up in the initial episode is clear - we've got freelancing ghostbuster brothers with a trunk full of dysfunctional (among other things).  I've always liked the \\"traveling angel\\" type of show (The Incredible Hulk, A-Team) wonderful poignant characters that blow into town, save your life, touch your heart and blow out again.   <br /> <br />The chemistry between the actors is really wonderful.  Dean's bravado and Sam's compassion are the heart of the characters.  Regardless of how they grow, I hope it stays there. <br /> <br />The special effects are nicely done, the stories are interesting and based on real urban legends or folk tales.  I have to admit that I like the episodes that reveal a little more about the brothers than the stand alone stories.  How they deal with each other is more interesting to me than how they kill another evil monster. <br /> <br />The episodes are complicated enough that I can watch them again and find new clues and nuances that I hadn't noticed the first time.  I look for those details because I know that the writers put things in there for a reason. <br /> <br />The special features are well done.  I especially like behind-the-scenes features, so having several really pleased me.  It's nice to see how excited about the show everyone is. <br /> <br />All in all, very enjoyable.  I'm glad I purchased it.

B0001ADAVK|5.0|In Mona Lisa Smile, Julia Roberts proves, once again, that she is the radiant queen of the screen, for, next to great talent, she definitely commands... <br /> <br />Julia Roberts plays the role of a teacher, Miss Katherine Watson, who dreams to make a difference, to leave a legacy that improves the collective spirit of those fortunate enough to be her students. <br /> <br />From humble beginnings, this art historian from California, goes to teach at Wellesley, during a time when women received an education as a side line to the real purpose, which was to get married and have a family. She is not the school's first choice, but the person that was available and walks into a room full of snobbish students, who are out to get her... because they \\"smell the fear\\" of the prey.  <br /> <br />At this private school, she begins to plant the seeds necessary for these young women to see themselves for more than just future wives, and to seek deep inside themselves to release the potential... lawyer... doctor... mother and wife... all combined in a package that is doable and possible. <br /> <br />The students, played by the likes of Marcia Gay Harden, Kirsten Dunst, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Julia Stiles, and Juliet Stevenson... are superb in their roles. The DVD offers special features where there are interviews that explain the arduous work of these young women to study the period of time, early 50s where the story is set, to act, dress, behave, and think like women starting to pursue their individuality, stepping outside the mold that until then, was the prescribed formula to happiness. <br /> <br />Simply... a movie not to miss... for as Julia Roberts shares the dream... to make a difference... she teaches us all great lessons, for to not conform to that which is expected, carries great consequences at a personal level. <br /> <br />Enjoy... and share this film with family and friends. It is indeed... a jewel!  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

Shortbus is definately not lacking in the sex scenes both homo and hetro ( and even some group orgie scenes ). <br /> <br />If you can handle that...then this is definately a movie worth seeing.   Although it is not your typical big budget hollyGaywood movie, it is a very well done movie with a good story line, and good acting by everyone in the movie.  I would definately give this a 5 Star rating. <br /> <br />

B000NVIXDW|3.0|I was fortunate to see Michael Buble on his first public UK appearance in London at Ronnie Scott's in 2003 and with his young band and new and fresh interpretations of some classic standards he was in tremendous form and hairs rose swiftly on the back of the neck and the excitement in the club was amazing. <br /> <br />Since then I have bought all of his albums with ever-increasing levels of anticipation to see what direction he will take and the fresh new ground that he might break but with each one, and for me without fail, these expectations are not being met. <br /> <br />I think Michael has to decide whether he wants to be the next, next Sinatra, or the first Michael Buble and at present - for my taste - there is enough syrup coming out of Canada from maple trees without Michael adding to it. <br /> <br />\\"Call Me Irresponsible\\" is an album that - save for one standout track - does not take Michael forward one semi-quaver and whilst he can still do the business in live, concert appearances it is his studio output that will eventually be his musical legacy and by which he will ultimately be judged. <br /> <br />And my standout track ? \\"It Had Better Be Tonight\\".  <br /> <br />With a really fresh take on the 1963 Henry Mancini arrangement of a Meglio Stasera classic, David Foster and Jerry Hey at last show they can break free from the arrangement and orchestration shackles of Nelson Riddle, Billy May and Don Costa and with this one song they prove that, once again, they can make the hairs on the back of neck start to quiver and stir.  <br /> <br />This is Michael Buble at his very best and doing his own thing in his own incomparable, Michael Buble way. <br />

B0000AQS0F|5.0|The great thing about this show was it's more realistic view of the human nature.  The story arcs are intriguing and the characters themselves are unique.  When I've watched sci-fi or read sci-fi, the characters were always the same.  The brave dashing Captain that would sacrifice everything he/she believes in for the greater good.  With the exception of Battlestar Galactica, this show stands alone exploring what anyone would do, when oppression and their way of life is ultimately changed for the worse.  It's a great show and I would implore anyone that is a true sci-fi fan to watch all the episodes!!
0345349571|4.0|I have to say that this book turned out to be a really nice surprise.  I found it in a used bookshop in Buenos Aires for 10 pesos and thought what the hell, I already knew a bit about the 14th century from a class I took in university and figured I could stand to learn a bit more.  As soon as I began reading it I knew I had found a rarity among history books, an informative and actually an exciting read!  This stems from the style employed by Tuchman.  Having chosen the area she wanted to cover, namely Western Europe in the 14th century, she needed something to provide a focus and uniting thread.  For this she took the somewhat unusual approach of selecting not a person of royalty, a religious figure, or a member of the lower social class, but a noble that has the advantage of straddling in various ways all three of the aforementioned roles.  Her noble, the Lord of Coucy, holding lands in the realm of northern France in the area of Picardy was an extraordinary figure by any consideration, involved in almost all the major military, political, and religious events of his.  Of course it helped his cause that the three spheres so often, if not always overlapped in his day.  Come to think of it, it still seems like those three spheres overlap quite often in our own age.  Funny how history has a way repeating itself, or as it has been said, history never repeats itself, men always do.     The 14th century was a time of profound change and upheaval for the people of Europe.  A long and destructive war was waged between the Kingdoms of England and France, known to posterity as the Hundred Years War, which was to leave both countries and much of Europe devastated long after the fighting had stopped.  During the middle of the century a new terror descended on all the peoples of Europe, the Black Death or Bubonic Plague.  Sparing neither rich nor poor, devout nor unbeliever, the great wave of death that swept through Europe multiple times in the last half of the century killedaround half the total population, which was not to recover its 1300 level until around the 1550's.  So terrible was the Black Death and its consequences that it was simply known as the `great mortality' to the people of the day.  To throw one more destabilizing agent in the mix, the later half of the 14th century also gave rise to the Pope's leaving of Rome in favor of a new residence in southern France at Avigion.  This eventually lead to what is known as the papal schism, where for a time there were rival claimants to the papacy with one residing in Rome and one in Avigion, with the countries of Europe forced to take sides between them.  For a time there were even three Popes at once.  In a world destroyed by war and death, people looked to God for answers and when they found a split Church more corrupted and ungodly than ever change was only just around the corner.     Tuchman does a wonderful job of tying together the major events of the time around a narrative centered on Coucy.  More often than not he is certainly a part of these events.  Throughout the narrative are sprinkled social, economical, religious, and further historical background, painting a vivid picture of the life in France and England, and to a lesser extent the Italian states, the Holy Roman Empire and the Iberian kingdoms at the time.  To this extent I think that Tuchman's book is a success.  As with all narrative histories though there are evitable flaws.  To say that one event leads to another in an continuous flow of cause and effect, especially when it is centered around one character, is to deny and miss a lot of areas of constant interaction of multiple forces that help to shape and form that particular time in history.  The tendency shown by Tuchman to attribute actions to individual leaders, personalities ,and whims seems to me to be a throwback to the ancient historians of the classical world.       Another flaw that I see is taking the life of a noble as a representation of the time.  A noble by definition is a person set apart from the masses of humanity.  To think that the Lord of Coucy or any of his associates in anyway represents what most people of the time experienced is to be deceived.  He was primarily concerned with his own class, namely the ruling class, and the power that was derived from the position.  Tuchman does much to paint him as a brilliant, enlightened man ahead of his time in many ways.  That may be true to some extent but it is nevertheless also true that he used all the means available to him to exploit those of a lower class, as did all in the ruling class.       Even though I have criticisms for the book, I still believe it carried out its function well, namely to illuminate that age of European history often known as the Dark Ages.  The choice of narrative as the vehicle for the history has its limitations as stated above but it also has many positives as well.  Anyone looking to gain a preliminary understanding of this very eventful time would do well to pick up Tuchman's book.  I can only guarantee that it will whet the appetite for a deeper search into the age.
B0006A9FMI|4.0|This sequel to the highly acclaimed original Ghost in the Shell is grittier than the original.  Reminds me more of a Shadowrun anime than the \\"cartoony\\" stories you're likely to find in much of today's anime.  It's a great story, though not as compelling as the original...it is definately a must see for fans of the series.
B0000542D2|5.0|very good beatles dvd. i don't know why some reviewers say the sound quality is bad, my dvd was perfect. the extras were a nice touch, to bad we didn't here from paul or ringo.
B000002KO3|4.0|i am a huge talking heads fan,but this album ranks no 4 on my list. their previous 3 albums are a bit more funkier and catchy. though i have to admit the great curve (off remain in light) is one of my favourites. buy all 4 you wont be disappointed!
B00004CWO8|5.0|I saw the live version of this production in Brisbane (April 2007) and it was truly magical and amazing. I did notice a couple of changes since the filming of the DVD. I love that Matthew Bourne's male swans portray the strength and well-known aggression of real life swans (not always easy to watch) and thoroughly enjoyed the DVD performances. It is good to have the traditional version of Swan Lake to turn to as well though, as I believe that it is important to preserve the original classical masterpieces that have inspired generations of lovers of dance.
B000002KNU|5.0|funky and very singalong. first week last week carefree is my favourite, this has some good saxaphone, dont think they used this instrument often enough on their albums.great pick me up!

B000HWXS2S|5.0|Not too long ago I was channel surfing on a Saturday night and had just gotten to \\"Headbangers Ball\\" when Amon Amarth came on.  I'd never heard of this band before, (and I have to wonder why not??!!!) but they had my attention right then and there!  A Metal Band with more than just a roaring lead singer and insane drums?!  What the.....??? Wow!! I mean really.... I like Metal anyway, but even if you are not a Metal fan, there is a lot to be appreciated by what these guys bring to the table. It's just very unique! Viking Metal?  Unusual, yes, but it makes for lyrics that are not the same old same old you hear a lot from other Metal Bands. Apart from that, the music itself and the true \\"headbanging speed\\" of these songs will get you hooked!  And since I watched the video....the guys have some awsome \\"windmilling\\" skills!!  My neck hurt just watching them! :)  I bought (and of course listened to) the entire album, and there is not one piece on it that I did not like!
B0000C3I6U|5.0|This is a great second version of Pumping Iron because of the comments and interviews with Governor Arnold at the end of the movie. Great for those who have followed the bodybuilding scene since the '60's.
1401900526|4.0|I found these in a gift shop and bought them for a friend.  When she opened them, the first card SHE picked reasonated with her.  Browsing through them myself, I found two that were definitely MEANT for me.  They aren't stocked many places, although Hay's other books can be found in many alternative/health type stores.  They are great as meditation cards, journal inspirations, or \\"just\\" affirmations.
B000I2JKCO|5.0|We already purchased the DVD when it was first released.  Now that I have an HD DVD, I was surprised to learn that The Polar Express was also available in that format.  Therefore this was the very first HD DVD that I ever bought.  I'll comment on both the HD version and the regular version.  <br /> <br />I played the DVD over last Thanksgiving when my parents came to visit.  I grew up in the 50's and 60's.  My dad said that it really put you into the Christmas spirit.  This movie will go down as a Christmas classic.  How many times have my family watched this since it was first released?  Don't ask.  I lost count.
B000O59AF2|3.0|I first saw Mission: Impossible when I was 15 and I didn't have a god-damned clue what the hell was going on. And I considered myself to be smarter than the average bear. In retrospect, it's not that muddled. In comparison to the very-dumbed down sequel it stands out as a better example of film-making made by a director who doesn't underestimate the audience.<br /><br />Brian De Palma is known to be a wildly inconsistent filmmaker. From the over-rated Carrie, to the under-rated Snake Eyes, the classic Untouchables and the downright hideous Mission to Mars and Scarface, he's been through just about everything. But Mission: Impossible was his first true mega-hit. Movies from TV shows are a dime a dozen these days and are rarely taken seriously, I mean look at trash like S.W.A.T. or Dukes of Hazard, but M:I is actually supposed to be a continuation of the show, rather than a spin-off.<br /><br />Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt (no, not cockney rhyming slang) an IMF agent who's entire team is killed in a phony sting operation in Prague. Accused of being a traitor he legs it before they can nab him and assembles a team of rogue operatives to find out who the REAL traitor is. Many double-crosses and double-double crosses ensue.<br /><br />For those who cannot follow the plot there are some really good set-pieces with enough tension and excitement to carry the whole movie. You'll know by now the dangling scene in the top-secret room but the best scene in the movie is the high-speed train rocketing through the English countryside. While other directors might use this as a chance to show off, De Palma keeps it as realistic as possible which makes it infinitely more cooler.<br /><br />Parts of the movie may seem a bit dated now and it's weird seeing Tom Cruise look like a little boy even though he was already 33. He even sounds different. And what kind of supervillian uses floppy discs? They could have tried something a bit more high-tech there.<br /><br />The M:I franchise could be a helluva lot better, I suppose. The second film was terrible and the third merely average. The only thing M:I is really notable for is that it's the point where Tom Cruise evolved from simple movie star to super-megalomaniacle, control freak, religious lunatic nut.<br /><br />At least it got off to a good start. But can the world tolerate Cruise long enough to ever get a fourth made?<br /><br />The HD-DVD features a 2.4:1 1080p picture that's pretty good for the most part but the film was just shot too soft in many scenes and there's not enough clarity to it for it to really be a demo disc. The DD+ sound design is simply alright, nothing to write home about. Extras are pretty good, if you're into all that.e could be a helluva lot better, I suppose.

B000OVLBF8|3.0|I think if I have a major problem with this film it's because I have a hard time getting into comic book mode.  I have never seen the comic book Ghost Rider so I have no basis to compare, but I thought this movie was okay as an action movie by itself.  It moved at a good pace and the special effects were nice.  Nicholas Cage played a very low keyed hero who didn't want anyone messing with the Carpenters.  There were nice touches.  Sam Elliot was...well, he was Sam Elliot, how could you not like him?  Peter Fonda was pretty good and I'm not a Peter Fonda fan at all.  Eva Mendes as his ex-girlfriend had potential, but to be honest I just don't think she's a very good actress.  She was weak in this film and annoying in \\"Hitch\\".  Those are the only two films I can think of to form an opinion.  Also, I know it's a comic book adaptation but for goodness sake, can't she find a blouse that fits?  You know, one that can actually button all the way up?  Anyway, this is a film you can enjoy if you don't want a lot of depth (sounds like me), you like motorcycles, (Like I do), and if you're just looking for some action that keeps moving (like me).  Wow, this sounds like the perfect movie for me.  I wonder why it didn't get 5 stars.  Here's some reasons:  1. Eva Mendes.  2. Lack of suspense. 3. A reason to be going through all this. 4. Totally unsympathetic characters.  So I say, go ahead, lower your expectations and watch it.  You could do a lot worse.

B00004CWO8|5.0|If you remember the movie \\"Billy Elliot\\", Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake will be a great follow up.  The last scene in Billy Elliot is of the Swan in this performance.   <br /> <br />What Gilbert and Sullivan set out to do a century ago was to make opera popular with people who thought opera was above them.  Bourne's work will have same effect on Ballet.  It is truly wonderful and highly recommended.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|This movie returns James Bond to a more realistic level that established the original legend,it gets away from \\"invisible cars\\"7 other unbelevable nonsense that crept into the later movies. I rate Casino Royale as one of, if not the best James Bond movie I have seen.
B000J103PC|5.0|My husband and I Netflix-ed this movie.  And he didnt' want to send it back.  I told him, \\"just buy it!\\" But he didn't want to spend the money.  So I did it for him.  He could watch and quote from this movie endlessly.  Very enjoyable.  I higly recommend it to anyone who likes clothing and a good story about \\"finding oneself.\\"
B000GIWS7E|5.0|Back in the early 90's I bought a Dream Theatre Cd \\"Images and Words\\" not knowing anything about it.  It quickly became my favorite CD.  Well, time passed and just recently I pulled out that CD and listened again and I thought \\"wow\\" these guys were really really good and started listening to it all over again.  And then I thought, \\"I wonder if these guys did anything after that?\\" I searched Amazon and discovered that indeed these guys had been very active over the years.  I decided to get there most recent CD \\"Octavarium\\" and was completely blown away by it.  Then I decided to get this DVD.  And I cannot say enough about how good it is. I thought prog rock had pretty much died and then I see this and realize that Dream Theatre has kept it alive and growing.  5 Big stars for this DVD and Dream Theatre in general.
B000MQ54OY|5.0|I have seen this movie in the theater a few times before and it was a terrific experience, very insightful, quite good fun.  However the expericence was greatly enhanced by the high defininition quality of the Blu-ray disk.  If you liked the movie before, you will become extatic over this version.
B00026WU4G|4.0|Infidels contains fast rockers, slow ballads and moving blues. This one is not as overtly spiritual as the preceding 3 albums, but there is still a devotional undertone throughout and potent religious imagery in some of the songs. Jokerman is one of those, a lengthy rumination with an appealing tune and gently lilting beat. Sweetheart is a slow conversational song reminiscent of some of his classic 1960s work.<br /><br />A highlight of the album is the fast rocking tour de force titled Neighbourhood Bully, quite striking in its urgent uptempo beat and perceptive lyrics. This track about media bias against Israel definitely stands as one of Dylan's most powerful songs of all time. The next, License To Kill, is a slow mournful ballad with lovely harmonica that becomes more prominent towards the end, whilst Man Of Peace is a slab of potent mid-tempo rock that warns against deception and brainwashing.<br /><br />The album impresses with its variety of styles, like the galloping rock of Union Sundown which is followed by the musically and lyrically intricate I And I, a tender blues number with stirring imagery. The album closes with the tuneful Don't Fall Apart On Me Tonight, a love song in a country-folk style, also with moody harmonica. Infidels is not on a par with masterpieces like [[ASIN:B00026WU3M Oh Mercy]] or [[ASIN:B000002C2E Time Out of Mind]] but still a strong album with more than enough classic tracks.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000025IS Saved]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000025O3 Shot of Love]]

B00005YW4H|5.0|Love this CD!  I play it every weekend, usually over the Sunday cocktail hour and it immediately puts all of us into a very relaxed state!  The songs are soft and smooth, some with a hint of jazz, others with a touch of blues.  At first, I liked only the songs I knew, but as I listened, I came to love every song.  This kind of music appeals to a wide range of tastes and ages....my 20 year old son stays around while it's playing as do my 13 year old son and my husband.  I think my dog really likes Norah's music too- he just curls up on the sofa, sighs deeply, and closes his eyes!  It's quality family time!

B000HKCRW2|4.0|I really found Pieces of People We Love very enjoyable being the type of album which brightens you day. I tend to stick it on whenever im feeling a little low, and its energetic beats and excitable vocals lifted my spirits. Although many believe that their lyrics can be a bit meaningless and simple, i found them a refreshing change to some of the darn right depressing, suicidal songs which tend to fill up the charts.  <br />Love Whoo! Alright Yeah uh ha video clip, a real fav of mine. Wyeth Hansen's animation is teriffic bringing a retro happy vibe to the scene.

B000NA2776|5.0|To begin, yes...there's a easy comparison to Mika and Freddie Mercury.  Being the HUGE Queen and Freddie Mercury fan that I am though....I'm so sick of hearing about it...as though Mika is as well!  It's not that it's a bad comparision, it's just that enough is enough.  We've heard it once...and now every other person who reviews his album in the newspapers, magazines, online, and etc...all have to say the same thing about him....when is it enough?  His music if fun, he's got a great voice...he certainly doesn't sound like everyone else out there.  Which is the exact reason why I don't listen to radio anymore.  You hear one rock song from this year or last..and you've heard 'em all!  That's why all these bands from the past are touring, and doing fantastic at ticket sales and beyond! While it's the exact reason why cd sales are down for all the current music!
0743289684|5.0|Occasionally a book  you reads changes your whole way of looking at the world. Infidel was one of those books for me. Ayaan Hirsi Ali has lead an amazing life and her story needs to be told the world over. This book changed the way I viewed the non western world, religion, America, Africa, politics, and the plight of women around the globe. It made me realize how fortunate we are in America and how blind most of us are to what's going on outside our borders. It inspired me that someone who came from such a challenging past could accomplish the many things Ms. Hirsi Ali has accomplished by such a young age. I intend to read this book again and encourage all of my friends to read it as well.
B000LAZDQA|4.0|When JCM released \\"Hedwig\\" it was original on many levels:  the main character is a drag queen with a botched sex change, it was a rock musical, despite the coarse treatment the message was still one of compassion and our search for love.  With \\"Shortbus\\", he now seeks to redefine, yet again, the purpose of film.  Film and movies have paradigms that are expected to be followed (if you want to make money you need star power etc) and one of the biggest is connected with our nathion's Puritanic roots:  you don't show the sex act if there is an implied sex scene.  And, if you are going to show the sex act, you make it obtuse and \\"artsy\\".  Shortbus makes sex and sexuality a very real thing for it's characters-- if two (or more) people start to make out, and you can tell it's about to lead to sex, JCM takes it to the next level and shows you exactly where that make out session really leads to.  Is it gratuitous, just trying to get some shock value?  I don't think so.  The film already has a voyeuristic quality, and this \\"realism\\" just adds to the audience's feeling of being an observer of some deeply personal moments in people's lives.  Is Shortbus destined to sweep the Oscars this year?  Doubtful, but I applaud Mitchell's desire to tell a story honestly, and not the way everyone else tells it, or expects it to be told.

B000001ELP|3.0|It is difficult to rate this album because there is no KISS album that ever sounded like this to compare the music. <br /> <br />With their 1980 release, 'Unmasked', being a big disappointment KISS (namely Paul and Gene) was convinced to release a concept album, in 1981, by producer Bob Ezrin instead of a planned album that would see KISS return to their old form. We would have to wait until the 1982 juggernaut 'Creatures Of The Night' for that effort. This was supposed to be the soundtrack for a movie. Hence the title 'Music From The Elder'. Other reviews have covered the story concept so I won't rehash that.  <br />This album seemed to be released at a sort of crossroads in the career of KISS. The fan base that made them multi-platinum sellers moved on and even the ever loyal KISS Army was becoming impatient with the bands change in music('Dynasty', 'Unmasked'). For KISS to release an album like this at that time was a big risk. A risk that failed. This is the only featured KISS LP that has not gone gold ('Carnival of Souls' I believe also has not, but it was released during the Reunion Tour and wasn't really marketed that much). Had the band put this out when they were enjoying stronger fanfare the album may have been accepted better. Also, this whole concept album idea and the final results alienated an already frustrated Ace Frehley to the point where he would leave KISS in the near future.  <br />Musically, this album showed the critics that the band has talented musicians- even though most of us already knew that. The songs \\"The Oath\\", \\"A World Without Heroes\\", \\"Dark Light\\" (The only Ace contribution), and \\"I\\" are the highlights. \\"Escape From The Island\\" is a great instrumental piece. This piece is also nice because you get to hear the short lived pairing of Ace and Eric Carr jamming together. Remember, this is a concept album. If you are listening to it for the first time just don't skip around the songs. They are all part of a story. The first listen shouldbe the album in its entirety. At the and there is some spoken dialogue. I had heard there was more of this throughout the album to help lead into each song, but was edited out in the final production.
B000O178BY|4.0|1st off, I have been a  Nine Inch Nails fan from 1st album to now and go see almost any live performance that comes to my area.  That said, this album is excellent.  I rate it somewhere in between Pretty Hate Machine and Downward Spiral, with hints of With Teeth. <br /> <br />  Trent tries to use sounds here that cannot come from an organic instrument, yet there is something organic about it (in a 1s and 0s way).  It's like we've found an old recording in a time capsule that has been through digital wear and tear and we get only 80% of a peak into the manic societies of the future.  Despite the preaching that this ablum, although obviously political, is a theme album presenting musical perspectives of a \\"possible\\" sci-fi-like future, it seems to still carry that personal journal feeling of the inner thoughts of Trent Reznor. <br />  Allegorical songs like \\"Capital G,\\" \\"God Given,\\" and \\"Zero Sum,\\" seem to express Trent almost selling out, as well as banging heads with the record industry/society.  He almost be-littles the work in \\"Zero Sum,\\" by lyrically saying, \\"All we've done and all we are, just 0s and 1s.\\"  The album having been composed mostly on a laptop and tons of samples.  The music is almost challenging to listen to at times, its very noisy, but ultimately structured to perfection, you might mistaken that he has shaked the beat, but its a trick, if only for a moment. <br /> <br />  The album grows on you in an unusual way, almost like a symbiote-suit, where at first you try brush off all the clingy parts cause its contricting, but then it becomes a confortable hold to which I have found myself lost to on a train ride to work. <br /> <br />  I still prefer his truly organic instrumental sound, but I'll take one of Trent's home-brewed albums any day.
B0000AQS0F|3.0|At this price this set is a great deal. The series is interesting and entertaining. It is also very violent. The story line does not compare with B5 though.

B000E5KUK6|2.0|For a long time, I never got the hate that was put on the \\"re-imagining\\" of Japan's monster mascot: Godzilla. Sure the movie at times was slow and casting choices were questionable but it had a kind of dumb fun aspect to it, like you couldn't get over how ridiculous it felt. Revisiting the film recently however finally made me realize whatever one saw right when it first came out: this is a dumb movie period with only fleeting amounts of good filmmaking attached to it. I like Independence Day and Stargate and even enjoyed the Day After Tomorrow but this...I don't know what this is. <br /> <br />Born out of nuclear testing in the French Polynesian islands, a lizard grown to monstrous size is making its way to New York. On hand to help out the military is Nick Tatapoulos, a scientist specializing in nuclear affected organisms, namely that of earthworms. His former girlfriend, Audrey, is a fledging-yet-struggling news reporter with friends \\"Animal\\" and Lucy. Arriving in New York is Gojira, a massive lizard who gets named Godzilla by the media and Nick, Audrey and Animal have to escape New York while evading the massive beast. <br /> <br />This is one of those cast lists where it's hard to enjoy the film because they picked odd choices for their actors. While Jean Reno can make anything cool, when you think action hero you don't necessarily think Matthew Broderick. I like him in smaller movies like Election but here he seems kinda...wimpy. A nice touch though is having 3 Simpsons actors, Azaria, Harry Shearer and Nancy Cartwright appear with the former 2 getting the more better outings (Cartwright is strictly a cameo). As for the lizard himself, I don't actually mind his design but turning him into basically an animal rather than this vicious stomp-everything tank was kind of a mistake. They try to create sympathy at the ending but it comes across like a bad idea that never changed all the way through. <br /> <br />Effect-wise it seems kind of possible. Like him or not,Emmerich movies tend to be the most coolest visually with many people going simply because there's a grandiose aspect to them. Godzilla is kind of hit-and-miss with some shots being well animated and seamless while others just look way too obvious and green-screened. The title character is similar with many shots looking really great while others have that kind of unfinished look at times. It's better than a guy in a suit of course but maybe someone with a more critical eye like Spielberg or Cameron would've done this best. <br /> <br />The film itself just feels sluggish. When he actually makes his initial appearance in Manhattan, it's as exciting as anything from Independence Day but then at a certain point something weird happens: he disappears for a good chunk of the movie. This happened in a way with ID4 where the aliens attacking, the best part of the movie became a big talky movie until the finale. This film isn't quite as uneven but the scenes don't really have the energy needed it's like it feels neutered. At times it's great like when he makes havoc on New York but other times it just doesn't quite cut it. <br /> <br />I liked ID4 and Stargate but this is quite the blemish. It's hard to even recommend anything about it without going \\"well no that wasn't good either\\". Rent at your own risk.
B00004SZWD|5.0|great album: one of my favourites through all times. I already own the LP but on cd the quality is excellent. great buy!!!
B00006LPER|5.0|Some may be put off by the length of the film (and even more by the fact that it is not in English) but I urge you to sit through this film, watch it to its disturbing end.<br /><br />This is an excellent film which looks more into how we view people and how they really are.  Huppert is excellent as a middle class piano teacher who on the outside is a rigid woman in control of her life as much as she is in control of her students, she demands perfection and accepts no excuses.  In her private life however, she is torn apart by contradictions.  Hupperts commentary in additional material sums it up perfectly, she is almost like a child.  Smothered by a mother who controls every aspect of her private life she resorts to what many would consider a 'perverse' private life.<br /><br />She becomes the unwilling victim of the attractions of one of her students, a young man who has it all, well off family, friends and the social standing that means what he wants, he gets.  After a long pursuit Hppert finally gives in only to discover that by opening up to this young man she may lose more than she ever imagined.<br /><br />This is a film that does at time demand your attention as does last over 2 hours but sit through it, you will be rewarded by the end.

Col. Moore gave this person high praise for his leadership skills in battle.  My friend survived this conflict but went on to give his life on his second, and VOLUNTARY, tour of duty in Vietnam.

The sexual tension is electrical and convincing.  A very exciting and powerful interpretation of the original novel by Charlotte Bronte.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|this movie is awesome.  some Africans may be offended by some of the racial content in the movie, but this society is still far more racist then anything in this particular movie.  this is a gangster movie with an amazing plot twist.  the basic story of the two sworn enemies infiltrating each other's ranks is interesting enough, but the role of DiCaprio's character really strikes the watcher.  if you do not feel some type of sympathy or empathy for this guy, then you need to get counseling.  Damon's character is necessary but not quite as interesting or complicated.  the ensemble cast makes the characters and the presentation of the story in this movie that much more attractive.  without going into any detail about the actual story, this movie's story will keep you in your seat for the duration of the film.  you have to watch this movie at least once.  i am not a big fan of awards shows and the entertainment industry, but every once in a while, the powers that be actually honor an artist that deserves to be honored.  Scorsese gets it done and finally got recognized.  even if you are not a fan of gangster movies, check this movie out.

Wafer thin. <br />However, I was enraptured by the story of Frida and the amazing performance (no wonder she was oscar nominated).  <br />I bought the soundtrack the next morning. It really got to me.This is a great soundtrack and, yes, it does help if you have seen the movie but not necessary. I loved the latin passion (highs and lows). Chervala Vargas as Elliot Goldenthal describes in the slieve was once Frida's lover. I loved her Paloma Negra. So powerful.  <br />There is something for everyone in this long soundtrack.  <br />Do as i have: watch the movie and buy the soundtrack. Worth the time and money.

0446615625|1.0|The author can tell a pretty good story, but the plot here is on the far side of improbable.  The problem is that he can't write worth a damn.  The dialog is really bad - *nobody* actually talks the way his characters do.  And the characters themselves are thinner than cardboard.  Baldacci seems to favor the George Bush view of life - totally black or white, you're either with us or against us.  Not to mention a few technical howlers.  Baldacci mentions, over and over again, the devastating effect of \\"supersonic\\" rifle rounds.  As far as I know, just about every rifle bullet (in fact probably bullets from most any gun) go supersonic.  This book is lousy, and I'll never waste my time with Baldacci again.  At least this one was loaned to me, so I didn't waste my own money. <br />

0767827791|3.0|Given that this film was nominated for numerous Academy Awards, I was expecting something a bit better. Were it not for William Holden's acting and an innovatively shot final scene, the film would be quite forgettable.<br /><br />\\"Picnic\\" is a fairly simple tale of a young lady named Madge (played by Novak) having to choose between her good-looking, stable, wealthy fiance, named Alan (played by Cliff Robertson) and a ruggedly handsome but poor new-guy-in-town, named Hal (Holdan's character). You can predict right from the start who is going to get the girl in the end.<br /><br />Hal can't seem to keep a job, and so he moves to a small Kansas town seeking employment from Alan, his old college roommate, whose father owns a large agribusiness. He gets the job but then falls for Alan's fiancee, Madge (Novak), and she falls for him too. His pursuit of Madge destroys his friendship with Alan and costs him his job, but you can be sure that the film's ending is ultimately a happy one: He gets the girl.<br /><br />I say the film's ending is \\"ultimately a happy one,\\" but I suspect that, in real life, most women would rather have the rich guy over the poor one. Holden's character is the kind of guy a \\"bad girl\\" might have an affair with, but Robertson's character is the type that most long to marry. Films like \\"Picnic\\" push the socially damaging \\"Lady and the Tramp\\" idea that unemployed, vagrant \\"bad boys\\" make desirable husbands. If they would have made a realistic sequel to \\"Picnic,\\" it should have shown Holden's character sleeping around, laying around the house drunk, sponging off Madge, and beating her because she isn't quick enough with his dinner.
1594200823|2.0|This is a book written by a carnivore who obviously loves his chicken, beef and pork, as well as eggs. (He also loves to drink wine with his food, which is to say, he's not really simply eating food while he \\"dines\\")<br /><br />At one of the four meals talked about I was struck by the fact that one of the 4 persons M. Pollan is cooking for is a vegetarian teenager, whose needs are simply ignored. Were M. Pollan truly an omnivore, or a cook worth the name, or simply a decent person responding in the here and now (not totally caught in his head!) he would have made a protein dish of lentils, beans or tofu, or cheese for this participant (fully 25% of the \\"clientele\\"!) as substitute for the chicken that the rest of them were enjoying. This is the giveaway.<br /><br />And being written by a lover of meat mostly, the book hardly deals with fish and milk which occupy such a huge place in the modern diet, and to obtain which human beings resort to such horrendous barbarity.<br /><br />The book deals with food chains in the USA, how (fossil fuel,) sunlight becomes (corn or) grass, then meat, which then gets processed/cooked, and then arrives at the table (for example). There is no discussion about how the food actually gets into the mouth. By means of the knife and fork, obviously. And this may be the crux of the matter, actually. (Probably the only meal, of the four, which the author actually touched, to bring to his mouth, was the fast-food Macdonald's burger, which is itself an interesting irony!)<br /><br />The modern western(ised) (wo)man - M. Pollan included, of course - has literally lost touch with his food, and so with the body, and by extension, with the earth. Is it not generally to be seen that those who eat with tools (weapons, really) are consuming stuff produced by farmers whose feet were on the tractor rather than on the earth?  Fishing trawlers, milking machines, power saws are other tools (weapons) that go with (un)civilised (wo)man's fork and knife.<br /><br />What M.Pollan really seems to be writing about is the Carnivore's Dilemma: to be(come) or not to be(come) a vegetarian, even vegan.<br /><br />If the book had managed to convince me that we are indeed constructed to be omnivores (which the author tries to do), the proof would be in my giving up my vegetarian ways. This has not happened.<br /><br />But I harbour a sneaking suspicion that Michael Pollan is well on the way to becoming a vegetarian, if not a vegan. And this is likely to happen simply because it's more aesthetic, as well as ethical, healthy...........<br /><br />The book deserves 2 stars and one half, one for the author's sincerity and willingness to take responsibility for his meat eating, one star for the effort that went into the research and writing; and half a star for the book's physical quality and appearance

It doesn't matter how good your product `really' is, or how hard you try, what matters is how your target perceives you vs competition. That basic truth, and how you could occupy the most desired position in the target's mind is the crux of this book.

0767817664|5.0|As someone who saw almost horror movie made in the 80s, I can tell you that this is one of the better ones.  It combines horror and comedy incredibly well and the older actors(Roddy McDowall and Chris Sarandon) deliver incredible spot on performances.  The younger group do a good job as well, though they have their moments of \\"roughness\\".  If you enjoy a great horror movie that is also very funny at the same time(purposely, not campy)...this is the movie for you.
0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins very clearly ilustrates how we as humans persist in our belief in the unnatural and how this is controlling our actions and minds to the point of justifying the most heinous of behavior in the name of religion. The prevalence of this belief is so high that, in the words of Sam Harris, \\"it is an intellectual and moral emergency\\". It is vital that adults read this book as education to cease this ridiculous belief and stop teaching this to, and influencing, their children. Along with climate change, this ranks as the top threat to our planet and our existence.
0307346609|4.0|I have been a hardcore zombie fan for years.  I will hungrily consume all available pieces of zombie related literature, movies, books, games, etc.  The Zombie Survival Guide by Brooks was outstanding.  This book is a fresh twist on zombie writing, with an interview-like format.  For the most part, it's very interesting and packed with the horrors of a world infested by the living dead as well as the practical matters of survival.  In this respect, zombie fans will be pleased.    However, there was one aspect of the book which I felt was totally out of the blue and unneeded.  We have enough brainless celebrities to crank out poorly thought-out anti-Bush statements while they fly around in their private jets and drive their SUVs.  Brooks' bias against what his characters call \\"the administration\\" shines with the clarity you'll find in a really immature author.  While the perspective is not supposed to be Brooks' own, the statements walk like a duck.  The American military is also insulted here and there.  One of the statements that is particularly upsetting for supporters of our great armed forces (i.e. any actual American) suggests that the Iraq war (constantly called a \\"brushfire war\\") so tired out our military that we had problems with living corpses.  Let me tell you, Brooks, we could go anywhere in the world the day after we finish Iraq and kick the living [..] out of anyone without losing a breath.    Maybe these people like Brooks think they're being individual and standing out and doing their duty by bashing Bush and the military, but it's the same thing everyone is doing.  Regurgitation, over and over.  Get some new thoughts, and get some respect.  If you don't, you may find yourself mentally bankrupt at the close of Bush's administration.      This one will leave you wishing that Brooks would have just covered the topic we bought the book to read about, which is zombies--something anyone of any political alignment can love!
0671015206|5.0|The title might sound cheesy, but the book really does share insights on what affluent, and successful really mean. It gives a great lesson on status symbols, and the proper attitudes towards work, and money to build wealth.  <br /> <br />What appealed to me the most, is that this is by no means a \\"get rich quick\\" book, or even a \\"get rich\\" book. It does however outline character traits of those among us that have become successful, and shows the many traps that most people, including high earners commonly fall into. <br /> <br />My only wish is that I would have read this book sooner.
006054094X|5.0|Rather than voice my own opinions about the topic of this book, I would say that the book is a good read. It's well written, well researched, and well presented -- and terrifically interesting. <br /> <br />Mr. Menzies uses much circumstantial evidence and a great deal of speculation in the absense of hard evidence, but it doesn't disqualify his proposal. He makes a good case, backed with very credible research and experience. Although it rips at much or our Eurocentric knowledge of world history, if you read this book with an open mind, it is as exciting as a good mystery novel.

B00005JPPL|3.0|This is your Swiss-cheese thriller for the summer of 2007. You know, with so many holes that they're almost par for the course, but the overall experience is one of momentary delight anyway. You savor it, then you go on your merry way. Suspend disbelief for best results.<br /><br />The whole crux of the movie is the FBI's frenetic hunt for a bunch of handsome European miscreants (sporting a bouquet of dialects) who're about to detonate a nuclear warhead in or around LA. The reason? Not sure. Perhaps to make a big bada boom. Perhaps to look real scary. We will never know, nor, I suspect, would the FBI team from the film. But that's not to stop them from acting all pensive and thriller-like. It showers much of the spotlight on light humor involving the protagonist and his love interest instead. He's a magician with a special skill that you should find out for yourself, and she's, well, magical. Some liberal scatter-shot editing follows, but it's a fun ride. The visuals of the Grand Canyon (that's what they were I presume?) are breathtaking. The ending credits roll does justice to the theme, and may get a final round of laughter.<br /><br />There is no way this film merits a serious review, but I will take the time to report one serious gripe: the hairstyles! Tom Hanks may have done an enormous disfavor to the cinematic community by sporting his little rumpled tuft in Da Vinci Code, which seems to have taken off -- Jim Carrie in 23, and now Nicholas Cage here. Time for some scissors, Hollywood! As for Julianne Moore, she's an actress in such fine form that although she's evidently in the middle of something goofy she brings to it the kind of pizazz one would expect from an actual blockbuster.<br /><br />Don't confuse the film with Michael Crichton's novel of the same name, be prepared for a pastime flick at the intellectual caliber of National Treasure, get your Coke and choco-chip icecream, and buckle up to enjoy a basically senseless ride.

He definitely returns to his roots here and digs deep into his dark side which he didn't do as consistently on With Teeth.  But this album shows him at his full potential and it's mesmerizing.  He draws you in to witness what he sees and feels.  Trent Reznor is a genius and has displayed that once again for us.  I can't stop listening to this cd.  And as usual so many of the lyrics hit home and are applicable to most of the human emotions that exist.  He is an inspiration to anyone with an interest in music and writing.  He creates both brilliantly.

B000065V1V|3.0|I bought Heathen for the song the \\"Everyone says\\"Hi\\"\\". This song is low-key, slightly melancholy and intimate. In this song, in David Bowie's vocals and lyrics, I hear qualities of world-weariness, irony and perhaps a wish for the old times. I don't know what the song is really about but its tone and manner makes me feel nostalgic and reminds me of my student days and old girlfriends.

I hope that enterprise and voyger come down as well. I am waiting for the orgianl series HD to come out on DVD. I think it is cheaper if you get the 7 pack bundle for all the next gen shows.

B000LC4TJ0|2.0|As soon as the Wiener Philharmoniker play the first bars of the Overture, we know that we are going to be in for a looooong evening. Nikolaus Harnoncourt's tempi are extremely slow and will remain so for the next three hours and sixteen minutes (excluding credits and curtain calls). This is a good ten minutes more than his previous efforts in Zurich (on DVD) and in Amsterdam (on CD). It is about 15 minutes more than the average performance, 25 minutes more than Gardiner or Mackerras.   This in itself, would be nothing special if Harnoncourt was able to inhabit his tempi, to draw meanings to them. Unfortunately, he doesn't. The reason for this lies in the fact that the music does not really lend itself to \\"contemplative\\" visions. \\"Le Nozze\\" is first and foremost a comedy, the pace is supposed to be reasonably brisk on stage: Nozze is not Parsifal and the big risk of a slower, more dramatic approach means that the piece is deprived of its meaning: your turn a slice of life into a meaningless, inanimate musical object, beautiful at times but completely devoid of life. The big finales at the end of each Act (pick any: I, II, III or IV) will be the saddest example of this static musical direction. The music does not move, the musical material remains motionless, and ultimately one loses interest in front of such a stubborn view of \\"Le Nozze di Figaro\\".    By conducting \\"Le Nozze\\" this way, Harnoncourt lends a sympathetic hand to the production of Claus Guth. An extremely good, profound stage director, Guth is much more at ease with tragedy than comedy (Fliegende in Bayreuth, Zaide/Adama in this M22 collection). He therefore turns Nozze upside down and offers us a grim, petit bourgeois world that is unilaterally grey and evolving around a big staircase - Claus Guth LOVES staircases. In this Ibsenian, Bergmanian world, the Count is a pathetic middle-aged bourgeois cheating on his wife, the countess a cheated wife with no nobility whatsoever, and these three hours are justan isolated, one even feels almost a common routine in the uninteresting lives of these extremely unsympathetic characters.  One feels that the cast has been chosen with this musical/staging project in mind. It evolves around the dark-toned Susanna of Anna Netrebko, great sounding but Susanna is not Violetta: however, she fits perfectly Harnoncourts's and Guth's designs. Dorothea Roeschmann has a big voice, but there is no nobility in her Countess: listen to Te Kanawa or Fleming, and you'll know what I mean. Again, in light of her position in the \\"concept\\", it makes sense. The Count of Bo Skovhus is very tired. A pronounced vibrato has invaded the voice and his is simply not nice to hear, but this is again in line with the concept. Schaeffer was very successful even if she is not my cup of tea: I prefer a mezzo-soprano Cherubino. Selig barks, McLaughlin is a fun Marcellina. The only one who refuses to play Harnoncourt's game is Ildebrando d'Arcangelo. He is very often ahead of the orchestra but he has a beautiful voice and he tries to impose his conception of the character at all costs, despite the conductor and despite the staging.   Brian Large directs the video: the numerous close-ups on Miss Netrebko - even when she is not singing are extremely annoying after a while.   Let's face it: there are not a lot of good reasons to own this Figaro. I'll stick to Haitink/Fleming in Glyndebourne (NVC Arts). Deutsche Grammophon has two very good performances in its catalogue: a film by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle (Prey/Freni/ Boehm) and a very good performance by Gardiner and Terfel. Harnoncourt should always be commanded for his sense of experiment and his permanent willingness to take risks, but here the experiment blows in his (and our) face. Avoid.

B000J3EEBY|5.0|Listening to Loreena McKennitt's \\"An Ancient Muse,\\" her 2006 release and her first new studio album in nine long years, is like welcoming the return of a dear friend. The silent years since 1997's \\"The Book Of Secrets\\" have not diminished Loreena's magical touch for celtic/world/pop music. Her singing voice is as soaring as ever, as is her musicianship and her incredible knack for storytelling. The moment you hear her wordless voice on the opening song \\"Incantation,\\" it's as if she never left. \\"An Ancient Muse\\" is easily one of Loreena's best works, and it may even challenge \\"The Visit\\" as my new favorite Loreena McKennitt album. Standout tracks include the swaying, hypnotic rhythms of \\"The Gates Of Istanbul,\\" the passionate sounds of \\"Caravanserai,\\" the lovely tale of \\"The English Ladye And The Knight,\\" and the album's epic track, the gorgeous \\"Beneath A Phrygian Sky.\\" As always, Loreena's music remains captivating and entrancing throughout. \\"An Ancient Muse\\" is an outstanding, most-welcome return for Loreena McKennitt.
B000KX0IOK|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />Daniel Dunn is a young man suffering from a severe case of cognitive dissonance.  By day, he works as an inner city school teacher and basketball coach, doing his part to help his students break the cycle of poverty and make something of themselves.  By night, he's a crack cocaine addict, scouring the bars and back alleys of the neighborhood in search of his next \\"fix.\\"  Somehow, Dunn is able to keep his deep dark secret hidden from the people at the school, until one night, after a game, he is found by one of his players completely strung out in a stall in the girls' locker room.  Drey, an inquisitive but level-headed youngster with problems of her own at home, doesn't turn him into the authorities, but rather strikes up a relationship of sorts with this man she admires, a relationship that might possibly hold the key to Dunn's eventual salvation.<br /><br />In his best role - and performance - since \\"The Believer\\" in 2001, Ryan Gosling proves yet again why he is one of the truly outstanding actors of his generation.  He hits not a single false note, playing a man completely beaten down by a demon he has no idea how to combat (he has apparently gone the detox, recovery-group route before but with no success).  Gosling's Oscar-nominated work here is mesmerizing and heartbreaking, as his character goes about leading this strange double existence, turning Dunn into a complex individual who is part Mr. Peepers, part tragic hero.  The screenplay by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck follows no set pattern or formula, moving fluidly and seemingly at random as it charts the very strange course Dunn`s life is taking.  The script carefully avoids having Dunn articulate too clearly his inner thoughts and feelings, leaving his actions and expressions to convey more than his words.  This not only provides Gosling with an opportunity to more thoroughly plumb the depths of his character but it makes the character himself more ambiguous and intriguing and thus much harder to read.<br /><br />Gosling is matched by young Shareeka Epps, who proves herself a screen natural in her acting debut as Drey, a girl made wise beyond her years by the circumstances of an absent father, an overworked mother and an older brother serving time in prison.  Despite all that, she is somehow still able to see the good in people, and it is that quality that allows her, tentatively at first, then with a bit more confidence, to lend a helping hand to her teacher.  Anthony Mackie is also first-rate as a neighborhood drug-dealer whom Dunn, with crushing irony, fears will be a harmful influence on Drey.<br /><br />Despite endless opportunities for feel-good moralizing and holier-than-thou speechifying, the film neither judge its characters nor preaches to its audience.  The movie is all about observing behavior and relating a compelling story, then leaving it up to the viewer to figure out how he feels about it all.  This is particularly evident in the closing scene of the film, which refuses to tie up all the loose ribbons into a nice, fancy bow, perfectly aware that life is simply too messy and inconclusive for pat endings.<br /><br />As director, Fleck uses a subtle handheld camera to bring a naturalistic feel to the film, but its movement is steady enough not to call undue attention to itself.  It's true that one does begin to wonder just when Dunn is able to complete all the mundane tasks that go along with teaching - the lesson planning, the grading of papers, the attendance at boring faculty meetings - when he is spending most of his evenings in search of the ultimate high, but we'll have to chalk that up to suspension of disbelief and move on from there.<br /><br />Beautifully acted and exquisitely directed, \\"Half Nelson\\" is easily one of the best films of 2006.osling is matched by young Shareeka Epps, who proves herself a screen natural in her acting debut as Drey, a girl made wise beyond her years by the circumstances of an absent father, an overworked mother and an older brother serving time in prison.

0784011680|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. Everything about it was absolutely perfect. I felt like I had to wait forever to get this, but it was so worth the wait. This is one award winning performance after another. I absolutely love it. You should DEFINITELY get it for yourself and your family.
B00006879E|5.0|I'm probably the minority that liked EVERY song on this cd except for one...\\"Must Get Out.\\" But every song is amazing, including \\"The Sun\\" and \\"Secret.\\" I don't see what people mean when they say things like 'mediocre.' Perhaps, if you did purchase the cd in hopes of them being another Backstreet Boys or Nsync, you might be disappointed. These guys have some soul in their rock and hopefully, it's not going away. <br /> <br />Well, I guess you \\"pop-lovers\\" are in luck. The new CD has more dance-type music on it. Don't know if it lacks substance like most of today's pop does.
B000JBWWRY|4.0|I have a 4yrs old son and he loves this cartoon, and me too i bought it because of the story its so intresting .
B000GW8RX4|5.0|<br />This is now a part of my 2,217 collection of albums & videos (and still counting).  <br /> <br />The video is clear, crisp sound, has good selections of songs and worth the price. This is rock music video at its best!   <br /> <br />Some of the songs performed are Mistreated, Catch the Rainbow & Still I'm Sad. There was a drum solo by Cozy Powell (Jeff Beck Group + Whitesnake + Black Sabbath + ELP + Yngwie Malmsteen) in the song Still I'm Sad. I believe Cozy was one of the best drummer among his co-rock stars like Tommy Aldridge, Aynsley Dunbar & Neil Peart. <br /> <br />As usual, you will see Ritchie Blackmore doing exhibition and smashing his guitar. You will see also a young RJD (Elf + Black Sabbath + Dio) in this video and you'll be impressed with his powerful vocals. He is currently again with Black Sabbath on a world tour as of this writing. <br />Introducing in this line-up was Bob Daisley on bass (later with Ozzy, Gary Moore and Black Sabbath). He replaced Jimmy Bain. David Stone who has replaced Tony Carey was on keyboards. <br />You will get also vintage videos of songs like Long Live Rock N Roll, Gates of Babylon and LA Connection. <br /> <br />So what are you waiting for? Stop reading this message and buy this dvd. <br />
B000MXPE7Y|5.0|This movie is so close to the truth it is unbelievable.  Some may not like it as it may seem slow or not action oriented -  but it is very close to the real thing.

0385335997|5.0|I love this series of books so much I recommend it to everyone I meet. The outlander series is the best series I have ever read, and I've read a lot of books. the first book in the series \\"Outlander\\", is the very best, most riveting story ever in the world! I laughed, and cried throughout. You won't regret buying this book and you'll want to save them in your library to read again or lend to all your best friends.
B000063DS1|5.0|I actually thought I purchased the DVD \\"The Last Waltz\\", but of course when it arrived, it was the CD.       I'm enjoying the music in my car and I'll look for the DVD (if available) the next time I order. <br /> <br />Love the music.
B000NA28IE|5.0|An excellant movie.  The book is as excellent. My newborn is named after the lead character Eragon it's that excellant to me.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|This is without a doubt the best Bond Movie of all time. <br />Daniel Craig brings depth, viciousness, strength and a body to die for. <br />Combining that with stunning locations and Guiness Boook of Records stunts... trust me you will not be bored.
B000068FY0|5.0|Saw Supertramp perform this album in full at Glasgow City Hall, November 1974. They blew me away. The support act was a newcomer - Chris De Burgh. Every track is a gem. Typical of the best '70's progrock, this album is best listened in total and in begining to end sequence. That night I new I was at the begining of something special. The next few albums were all five star performances. Their live shows were note perfect and and enthraling. They can sound a little dated now. However the memories are magic. The line from Supertramp leads through current bands such as Coldplay and Snow Patrol.
B00005JPCF|4.0|The music and singing is great. This movie kept my attention and think this movie is for any age.
B000002OVJ|5.0|This is not a bad album actually.  Really.  Give it a listen.  It's a concert  somewhere in England it's live not like the Who I saw at Pontiac Stadium in Detroit before the band changed all around but still the seed of fame is there growing just the same. <br /> <br />If you've seen The Who then I don't know what you're doing reading this but then any who is a lot but if you haven't and you want to know what you're missing Rock and Roll! <br /> <br />This is a double album of songs The Who have had around for years and the musicianship is about all that you can expect for a very tight four piece concert band.   <br /> <br />I must say the taste required to enjoy this album runs a little off the wall but that's only in a very few numbers so you can relax and enjoy some of the hits that made The Who famous here. <br /> <br />I like My Generation.  \\"People try to put us down... talkin' 'bout my generashean\\" I'm afraid I missed most of this Generation as it were 'cause I was only ten years old when this song first came out but it drew me to it like a siren in the night since I first heard the opening chords on the  local radio station. <br /> <br />Magic Bus and thirteen other songs are played Live in concert on this album Live! just The Who and you to put in two albums worth of Rock and Roll.  Not a bad album at all.  Seriously. <br /> <br />Five stars out of five even for a live album. <br /> <br />
0767802470|1.0|The first side of the DVD is in English, the second side in German.    I wasn't aware of this feature when I ordered the DVD.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|It may seem like this movie is slow to some. I know there are a lot of people out there who expect non-stop action and stuff like such in a movie and don't accept anything else. But if you are really watching it the action, the movement, the cinematography the action the whole nine yards plus some, the over all quality of the movie is superb! I recommend this movie to everyone, open minded or otherwise. It truly has meaning, the depth of the story is staggering.  I just don't know what to say except, at least watch it and see it for yourselves. Truly a materpiece in my opinion.
B000MV8ZD6|4.0|The House by the Cemetery was released during the height of Lucio Fulci's career. From between 1979-1983 is the era Fulci will forever be known for. While he had some solid movies prior to that it's really the 79-83 era is what he will be remembered for. The House by the Cemetery might be one of the weaker ones from that era, but yet there is something strangely compelling about this movie. Maybe it's the fact the movie is so incoherent at times and that it's sort of laughable. Or maybe it's the unintentional comedy like the bat attack scene.<br /><br />Lucio Fulci in my opinion was a director who was able to build some good suspense and tension due to his visual style. Even in some of his lesser movies he was able to make something out of nothing even if he was unable to maintain it. In The House by the Cemetery some of that can be found. But the biggest downfall of the movie is the really poor dubbing for Giovanni Frezza who will forever be known to hardcore horror fans as Bob. Apparently he was dubbed by a woman, but regardless the dubbing was just bad. Any scene he was in was comedy gold. This, in a way adds to the movie, but also takes away from scenes that might have played out better with some better dubbing.<br /><br />Lucio Fulci was a filmmaker who can be really hit or miss and sometimes even in the same movie. The House by the Cemetery is one of those movies. The opening scene was quite effective; the set up was great and it had a creepy feel to it. The pacing here is slow; after the opening kill scene we don't get another for a good 40-min. The movie is filled with a lot of talk and a lot of scenes that never really go anywhere despite a build up with the characters and some interesting ideas.<br /><br />Lucio Fulci seems to be building up something with some of the characters, but yet it never comes to be. The babysitter Anne seems to have some kind of big revelation coming, but it never happens. Any scene she is in has this weirdness to it, but yet nothing comes to be. What makes this movie so inserting is it's sort of a zombie movie due to the Dr. Freudstein character, but it's also sort of a slasher movie and than throw in some supernatural haunting. The House by the Cemetery had an interesting idea, but sadly the movie is so incoherent with nothing really explained everything is sort of lost.<br /><br />The House by the Cemetery easily rates as one of Fulci's most incoherent movies; nothing really makes any sense at all nothing is really explained. Bottom line is what little plot we get is very messy. The screenplay was written by Giorgio Mariuzzo, Lucio Fulci and Dardano Sacchetti. If the other 2 writers sound familiar they should. Both have worked with Lucio Fulci several times with Sacchetti being the man responsible for several of Fulci's more popular titles.<br /><br />While Fulci manages to build some suspense due to the messy plot and poor dubbing it's hard to sustain it and the scenes start to become funny for the wrong reasons. There was some decent suspense and in my opinion the final act is actually quite solid. Like I said Lucio Fulci was the type of director who could be very hit or miss and sometimes even in the same movie. Gore-hounds though fear not, when there is a gore scene Fulci doesn't hold back at all. While some dub this his goriest I have to disagree. The gore is excellent done by the always reliable and much underrated Giannetto De Rossi. Not Fulci's goriest, but when there is gore it will please the fans.<br /><br />Most of the cast are Fulci regulars; many of them have done several movies with Fulci with Katherine MacColl probably being the most well known. Despite all the flaws of The House by the Cemetery I couldn't help, but really enjoy the movie. As I stated earlier sure the movie is incoherent nothing makes sense. Some of the characters seem to have some kind of revelation ready to come out and it never does. But I was really enjoying this movie. Maybe it was the flaws that make this movie so much fun?<br /><br />The look of the movie was excellent; like I said before Fulci had a great visual style and along with cinematographer Sergio Salvati who worked with Lucio Fulci quite a few times really create a great look for the movie. There are a lot of scenes that have a great creepy feel and the overall tone of the movie is well done. The House by the Cemetery featured a lot of people from past Lucio Fulci movies, which helps the movie, but one would expect a bit more seeing as these people done some great work with Fulci.<br /><br />In many ways this is one of Lucio Fulci's weaker efforts from this era and it's also one of his strongest at the same time. The House by the Cemetery has a great and creepy feel, but the plot is incoherent and revelations that seem to be waiting to come out never do. And the ending is also a bit complicated. But despite all this I highly enjoyed this movie. Fulci purists will probably get enjoyment out of this so if you like his work I would say this movie is worth seeking out. For those who don't like Fulci's work this probably won't be the movie to change your opinion of him.<br /><br />My review for House by the Cemetery may not sound positive at all, but I did enjoy the movie a lot more than maybe I should have. Despite all the flaws there is just something really creepy about House by the Cemetery. As stated before in many ways this is one of Fulci's weaker and stronger efforts.vie was excellent; like I said before Fulci had a great visual style and along with cinematographer Sergio Salvati who worked with Lucio Fulci quite a few times really create a great look for the movie.

1400049628|3.0|I much preferred World War Z over the Zombie book. It's much better written, requires less of the reader and makes its points far more succinctly.  <br /> <br />First of all, to enjoy this book you have to buy into the concept of a zombie invasion and that this is a mock csurvival guide in event of such an invasion. Uh...I don't think so. Then, you have to sign off on page after page of needless filler and bits and pieces of endless repetition, all supposedly to prepare for this invasion...enough already! <br /> <br />It's hard for me to believe that the same author wrote both books.

0792163710|5.0|One of the greatest westerns of all time. Why this is so is hard to define. Maybe it's Alan Ladds performance or the fact that the characters (other than Ladds) are truer to life than they are in most westerns. I don't know, but it's a movie that can be enjoyed over and over again. The fight scenes, although exagerated, actually result in bloody noses and split lips which is never the case in modern movies ( modern movies suggest a man can be hit over the head with a sledge hammer without any serious effect ) <br />The DVD is very good. The frames have been enhanced so there are no film scratches or blips; the quality is probably better than the original.
B000IU3XTM|4.0|A wonderful album and worthy follow-up to \\"O\\". In some respects, better than \\"O\\" although a tad blunt at times in the lyrical department. The only true dud here is the lousy \\"Me, My Yoke, & I\\". The rest of it is great, in my opinion.

I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone!

1563899426|2.0|After years of holding out, I gave in.  Friends, acquaintances, and reviewers had gone on and on about how Bill Willingham's FABLES was the latest greatest thing in comics, so I decided to give FABLES VOLUME 1: LEGENDS IN EXILE a shot.  I was severely let down.  While Willingham's premise for this series is very interesting (storybook characters living in present day New York City, exiled from their familiar fantasy lands by \\"The Adversary\\"), it isn't the main focus of this particular story.  Instead, this collection of the first 5 issues in the series is a boring and fairly predictable murder mystery; specifically, the investigation into the murder of Rose Red.  It's been a while since I refreshed myself on fairy tales, so I have no clue who Rose Red is, and Willingham doesn't provide much information on her, or any other characters, in the book.  So my main question upon finishing this book is:  why am I reading crime fiction in the first story arc of a title called \\"Fables\\"?  Furthermore, am I supposed to be interested in the murder of a character with whom I'm not familiar?  This is not enough to keep me interested in this series.  I have told the various people who recommended Fables that I am not continuing with it, and they all say, \\"Well, it gets much better as you go.\\"  Sorry folks, but I can't afford to keep dropping money on more trade paperbacks in the hopes that something will get better.  On to other titles...

I love the main character and this book as given me good ideas also.

B000N3T0DW|5.0|Another great film by Almodovar...I have seen most of his films because of a class I took in college, so it's interesting to see his development as a filmmaker.  Even though his last films are a little more serious than his first ones, he does a great job in Volver combining the absurd with the everyday, the taboo subjects, nostalgia, complex realtionships all wrapped into one.

1881273989|5.0|The 5 Love Languages are an essential piece of understanding how people tick.  I first heard about the Love Languages at a church retreat and bought this book as a gift for my boyfriend after I read the first book.  This one has practical advice for singles in a dating or courting relationship but the knowledge you get from the book can be applied to any relationship.  You will learn how to relate with other people in a way that gets them to respond and grow closer to you as a friend.  I have found it helpful even at work for the people that report to me. I think the original book is the best one but if you or your audience is looking for singles advice and guidance this will be a good read too.
B00005JPP6|5.0|\\"Hot Fuzz\\" is excellent! From the creators of \\"Shaun Of The Dead\\" (2004), comes \\"Hot Fuzz\\". The cast led by Simon Pegg (as Nicholas Angel) (who also played Shaun of \\"Shaun Of The Dead\\") and Nick Frost (as Danny Butterman) (who also played Ed in \\"Shaun Of The Dead\\") is excellent. The directing by Edgar Wright (who also directed \\"Shaun Of The Dead\\") is excellent. The story and screenplay by Wright & Pegg (both who also wrote \\"Shaun Of The Dead\\") is excellent. The music by David Arnold (who also did the music to \\"Casino Royale\\" (2006) is excellent. The cinematography by Jess Hall is excellent.

The costume design by Annie Hardinge (who also did the costume design to \\"Shaun Of The Dead\\") is excellent. This is an excellent action-comedy spoof that does an excellent job of spoofing the movies that it references. Another hit from the creators of \\"Shaun Of The Dead\\".

B000N6U0E2|5.0|Awesome. GREAT!!! A wonderful DVD about courage, determination, love and all based on a true story. It shows that a Father's love can and does make a beautiful impact on thier child's life. I recommend this to anyone and everyone. A great family movie that teaches many meaningful lessons to kids and adults alike.
B00000I8NC|5.0|the first godspeed album (if they can be so descibed) i was exposed to was \\"raise your skinny fists like antennas to heaven\\" which literally blew me away. the band never appears to be in any rush, your mind wanders and then suddenly you find yourself in a world devoid of sanity. and as quickly as it came it drops off. the great thing about godspeed is that no one is singing pissy lyrics, the band knows thier strenghs and play to them. \\"slow riot\\" does not let down. its short but fulfilling. the highlight is blaise blaiseys apoliptic poem about the shortcomings of peedsamerican constitutionalism set aginst the various wailings of godspeeds noises.  the story about parking tickets is also intriging, if somewhat similar to the sample on djshadows introducing..... anyway if you like godspeed, buy it. if you have a nervous disposition and are liable to be induced into insanity by your surroundings, buy it aswell and watch the fireworks

B00027JYLC|3.0|This is not a \\"OH,WOW! You gotta see this!\\", but it was definitely a one of a kind.  I like how they portrayed the \\"freaks\\" as the normal people.  It's just overall an interesting movie.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This holiday classic is seen by millions of people each December, and for good reason. Its message, similar to A Christmas Carol, is that a good look at your past deeds will help to put your current world into context. In Scrooge's case, it was his bad past that helps him to create a better future. In this Capra tale, it is the realization that the main character has done a lot of good in the past - and that it really has made a big difference in peoples' lives. <br /> <br />I won't give away a lot of plot details here. If you're like most people, you've probably seen this several times over the years and appreciated the nuanced layers of meaning offered by the storyline. If you haven't seen this yet, then most definitely rent or buy it for a viewing, without \\"knowing what's coming\\". <br /> <br />You can say the movie is a bit sappy - but there are times we can all appreciate a bit of sappiness in order to help a message \\"go down\\" more smoothly. We've all had times in our life that we feel frustrated, that maybe we aren't making a difference. This movie helps to show that the feelings are common ones - and that usually they are not warranted at all. The movie also helps to demonstrate that good deeds are always remembered, and that people really appreciate even the little ones. <br /> <br />A good movie for watching with family and talking about.

B000N3SRRC|5.0|\\"Tell me, why Dick Cheney underneath my bed?\\" You've gotta love the imagery these guys conjure up in their songs. If the pre-plane-crash Skynard and the pre-'78 Sabbath ever had a love child, this album is the undeniable proof.<br /><br />I'm Hooked! Each Clutch release has gotten more and more honed and \\"From Beale Street to Oblivion\\" is the simply the sharpest tool in the shed. There is definitely a \\"Clutch sound\\" and this album will not surprise a seasoned fan. But it is also very accessible is terms of catching new fish in the net. I hope they finally break through, and I mean HUGE. Major exposure should not be considered \\"selling out\\" but rather, getting the much needed gospel of Clutch out to the masses who are starving on a diet of nu-metal and just-add-water, re-re-recycled \\"indie\\" pop-rock.<br /><br />Musically, I think this is the most creative release, to date, for Clutch. This is the next obvious step in the song writing style for this group. If you like the direction that started at the tail end of \\"Robot Hive,\\" get this record, \\" Whether legally, legal-ish, or otherwise!\\"
B000NVIXFK|3.0|Dear hardcore Rush fans, don't freak out, I'm one of you. Been a fan since I first heard \\"Fly by Night\\" on my transistor radio when I was 8 years old. I eagerly awaited the release of this album and am equally exited about their upcoming tour for which I have tickets. However, I'm a bit dispointed in this release. The production is crystal clear (a big change from Vapor Trails - a great CD, but horribly recorded). The songs are textured, layered, and as always, Rush has chemistry and timing unlike any other rock band in history. Geddy absolutely pumells the bass on this one. Alex's guitar seems to have taken backstage again though. Despite his birlliant acoustic interludes, he doesn't really step forward as much as expected after Vapor Trails and his heroic work on ther EP of classic covers \\"Feedback\\". Geddy sounds as confident as ever on vocals, and although Peart is still the finest percussionist in the history of rock music, I have to say, \\"Neil, come on man, show off a little\\". His drumming has matured, but us old schoolers I'm sure would love to hear a little more skin punding than is present on this release. The three instrumentals are great on this album and track standouts include \\"Far Cry\\" and \\"Bravest Face\\", but I just don't feel the groove, the anthemic arias, and those tracks that just give me chills like other Rush CD's do. It's more a sum of the parts than any one issue. This release just doesn't rank up there with thier top releases. Actually, to be painfully honest, with the exception of \\"T4E\\", \\"Counterparts\\", and \\"Caress\\", I'd put this in my bottom four Rush relases of all-time. Sorry all. It's still going in my collection, the concert will rock I'm sure, but after 12 listens, I'm still disappointed.
075640407X|5.0|When I come across a new author, I'm always pleased. When the book actually turns out to be good, I'm jealous, but hopeful, because that means that I have a chance to do something with my own writing. Patrick, you make me sooo jealous with your debut novel. But I've got my novel file open again, thanks to you.<br /><br />This story has magic, music, mystery, romance, alchemy, and in spades. Kvothe is a fine protagonist, very human even though he has amazing abilities. He can be brought low by pride, just like the rest of us. It's easy to imagine him, red-haired flying, playing his lute, tackling the trials at a magical university, pursuing a girl, building a name for himself that is founded on lies but mostly true...<br /><br />Beware: this book has an ending that will leave you desperate for more. Me, at least, and I didn't expect it. But I very much look forward to reading more in the Kingkiller Chronicle. Well done, Patrick.<br /><br />(Bought on a thursday night, finished on saturday night, and that's only because my roommate and I went shopping fri night. It would have been finished much earlier if not for that. Read Robin Hobb's review and knew I had to have it!)
B00005JNS0|5.0|I'll admit, when this movie first came out, I thought it was going to be very boring.  B/c seriously, what's so great about a talking cars?  I have to admit with the opening sequence of the movie, I was starting to think that this movie was going to boring.  But when McQueen gets lost, that's when the movie really picks up.  After that, the movie is all uphill from there.  I will give yall a hint b/c after the movie credits are done, stay tuned for something a little extra.
B00003CXXO|3.0|A drama in all the sense of the word, A.I. Artificial Intelligence, brings to the screen the story of a couple that adopts an android capable of love following their son going into a coma.  Things become rather complicated when the young boy regains consciousness... <br />The cast does a good job in their respective roles though its Haley Joel Osment that steals the show. <br />The similarities with Pinocchio are evident and the film focuses on human relations, hope and inner strength, as well as love, devotion and integrity.  <br />Very serious and very slow at times it does not aim so much to entertain as to stimulate one's mind and emotions. <br />Recommended for Haley Joel Osment (who is really great) fans and for those with a taste for depression in the extreme. <br />

B000N6U0E2|5.0|Based on a story inspired by true events, Will Smith portrays Chris Gardner who is a salesman in San Francisco at a time in his life when everything is in a downward spiral.  After a series of difficult problems with his girlfriend, she walks out on Chris and her son and he is now confronted with the prospect of single parenting and all the challenges that go with it.<br /><br />Determined to make a better life for him and his son, Chris accepts an unpaid internship position in a training program for stockbrokers.  Without a steady income, it is a painful time for father and son financially.  They are subsequently evicted from their apartment and then from a motel and finally they experience the reality of homeless shelters.<br /><br />With the power of love dominating all else in their lives, Chris and his son feed off of each other's strengths and overcome each new obstacle thrown in their way.  With an iron will and an overwhelming desire to succeed, Chris Gardner overcomes heavy odds to eventually become very successful in his stockbroker career field.<br /><br />I don't think I've ever seen Will Smith in such a dramatic and profound role.  He is about the only well know actor that I recognized throughout the movie and his performance is outstanding.  The storyline is, at times, a sad and depressing one but the build-up to the conclusion is nothing short of inspirational and uplifting with a classy, heartwarming ending.<br /><br />`The Pursuit of Happyness' is a very good movie all the way around and it is very enjoyable to watch.  This is recommended to everyone.
B000024QML|5.0|This is an unusual Pet Shop Boys album... if u compare with others, you won't find anything so energetic and electronic.<br /><br />Very is VERY good! it's minimalistic, it's in a higher level, it's pop!<br /><br />My favorite albums are Very and [[ASIN:B000002JA8 Bilingual]]. I really recommend them to be bought, they're pet shop boy's best!<br /><br />The songs are great, even more the non-singles, like Different Point Of View, Dreaming of the Queen, and Young Offender (one of my favorites).  I Wouldn't Normally Do This Kind Of Thing and Yesterday, When I Was Mad are in different versions from those released, which are great, and Go West has a hidden track in the end.<br /><br />Very is known to be the hits album! it was made to recover the high charts after [[ASIN:B00005J9M3 Behavior]]. so, it's a mix of everything commercial and pop. that's the reason it has to be considered so PetShopBoys!<br /><br />if you want to begin PetShop, begin with [[ASIN:B0000D7ZE6 PopArt]] of course!!!! After that, come to Very! you won't regret it!
B000LXH0AE|3.0|I'm a bit flummoxed by this film. I didn't really like it. <br /> <br />I had expected to like it--I thought it was going to be an more-intelligent-than-average, feel-good comedy, but I didn't find that much to laugh at in this film, or to feel good about. <br /> <br />Instead, it's a quirky sort of character study, infused with some ponderous (almost pretentious) philosophical asides. Maybe the fact that it stars Will Ferrell threw me off? I don't know. Honestly, I'm not even a huge fan of Will Ferrell's comedies, and frankly, I thought he did a fine job here. Like Jim Carrey, Adam Sandler, Robin Williams and others, I'm gratified to see Mr. Ferrell branch out (and succeed). However, I don't think that Ferrell's regular fans will much enjoy this film, and I feel as though the initial trailers didn't make it clear enough that this was outside of his normal area. <br /> <br />Anyways, the acting is all fine. Thompson, Gyllenhaal, Hoffman, Latifah... they're all great, as is usual for all of them. But the script, and story, left me a little cold. It's all very odd, but never feels as powerful, poignant or sweeping as, say, a Charlie Kaufman film. The oddness never has an explanation (which isn't strictly necessary) or, to my mind, a compelling thematic reason for existing (which is). It just feels like a gimmick, used to sell the movie to executives at a pitch meeting. The movie feels like it's trying to be profound, which is a thing that I think rarely works out. <br /> <br />Interesting film. But too much oddness, too much striving to be clever, and too little enjoyment and heart. <br /> <br />Two and a half stars, rounded up to three in deference to Will Ferrell's emergence as a capable serious actor.

0375707972|4.0|In the book The Reader, Bernhard Schlink narrates the story of Michael, a fifteen year old boy who has a love affair with Hanna, a woman over twice his age. Schlink's novel follows Michael through adulthood as his life intermittently intertwines with that of Hanna. Set over the backdrop of Nazi and post-World War II Germany, The Reader offers more than a fictional tale of one man's struggle to come to terms with his past. Through the characters of Michael and Hanna, the author provides his audience with insight into German society and its attitude toward the past. Although Schlink's novel appears incredulous at times, his metaphoric approach to Michael and Hanna's relationship illustrates the difficulties modern Germany has faced in acknowledging and overcoming its Nazi past.<br /><br />Schlink's characters have a metaphoric quality. Michael represents modern Germany while Hanna's character is symbolic of old Germany. The relationship of two Germanies is expressed in that of the characters. In the book Michael asks himself \\"Why does it make me so sad when I think back to that time... Is it the knowledge of what came later, and that what came out afterwards had been there all along?\\"  Michael is referring to the knowledge he gains later in life when he discovers that Hanna was employed as a guard in a Nazi work camp. Michael's reaction of sadness or even a sense of disappointment can be seen as symbolic of the reaction of Germany's modern youth to the involvement of their parents in the Nazi regime. Schlink's generation in Germany finds disappointment in their parent's acceptance or lack of resistance to the Nazis. By questioning how involved their parents were, Schlink's generation can no longer look back on their youth in the same way. It has become polluted by knowledge.<br /><br />Michael's relationship with his father further serves to metaphorical express that of old and new Germany, as does many of the other relationships throughout the book. If the audience wishes to examine the content of the book through a metaphorical analysis, they might also imagine Michael and his ex-wife, Gertrude, as symbolic of East and West Germany. His daughter, Julia, \\"who swam like a fish in water\\"  when he and Gertrude were together, yet seemed out of her element when they were separated could be seen as the German people. Numerous metaphors exist or could be imagined within the text. Instead of focusing on who or what is represented by this or that person, it might be more helpful to analyze the behavior of the characters to better understand West German society.<br /><br />Three events within the book stand out to me as revealing of attitudes, both of the old and the post-World War II West Germany. All of these events occur in the last chapters of the novel. First, I found it interesting that Hanna refuses to acknowledge her illiteracy even though it might spare her harsh sentencing for her crimes. Her unwillingness to admit her inability to read seems prideful. This act suggests that in a society in which the literacy rate is above 90% an individual who is illiterate might be ostracized.  Hanna's refusal to allow anyone to know that she is unable to read also implies that being illiterate is worse than admitting you were a member of a party that killed innocent people.  It is worse to steal than it was to kill an individual. By suggesting that killing an enemy of the state (Jewish or foreign worker) was better than illiteracy or theft implied that old Germany had no remorse for its actions. That being indifferent to murder of such `enemies' was just part of doing your job and no one should be held accountable for these actions.<br /><br />In addition to the nonchalant reaction of old Germany to murder as portrayed by Hanna, I also felt that Michael's resuming his reading to Hanna provided insight into West German society. Although Schlink's generation was saddened by their parent's involvement or lack of revolt against the Nazi regime,it seems that they ultimately forgave them. Michael's reading to Hanna is symbolic of this forgiveness. His initial reaction with Hanna is to be accusatory. After Michael moves beyond his desire to accuse he does not altogether forgive. Instead, his reconciliation with Hanna occurs in steps. He begins to send tape recordings of various books to Hanna while she is in prison. However, this is the only contact he allows. After some time, Michael agrees to see Hanna and assist her in the process of assimilation into modern society. Michael's actions seem to represent new or modern Germany's forgiveness of their parent's or their country's past actions. Although they might not agree with these actions, it is necessary to acknowledge the past in order to precede forward.<br /><br />Regardless if the audience approaches the book from a metaphorical analysis or just as general fiction, the book seems to be speaking about acknowledgement and forgiveness. Not that one must agree with what has happened, rather forgiveness in the sense that what has happened is our past. We must accept some responsibility or ownership for this past in order to move forward. The book is extremely open for interpretation. I do not feel that my perception of the overall message is the only possibility. This lack of absoluteness and the length of the book might be its most interesting aspects. Although the novel is only 218 pages, it speaks volumes.seems that they ultimately forgave them. Michael's reading to Hanna is symbolic of this forgiveness.

B000GPIPVU|5.0|The first time hearing the CD, I was a little dissappointed.  I really liked his first CD and was looking forward to more of the same.  I don't know what I was thinking!  A second time through and I was convinced that Ray LaMontagne is the best \\"unknown\\" singer and songwriter today!
B000002L99|5.0|I loved 1984. Loved it. I thought Van Halen had reached its peak, and then, poof! David Lee Roth was gone. When I heard that Sammy Hagar would replace DLR, I was skeptical, but figured I'd give it a chance.  <br /> <br />What a good thing that I did!  <br /> <br />Sammy greets the listeners for the first time with a hearty \\"Hellooooo baby!,\\" and then the rocking starts. The mix of songs is fantastic, and all are perfectly placed on the album, save for the one throwaway song, \\"Inside.\\" The new Van Halen showed all the elements of a solid rock band, from power to subtlety to just plain old good time fun music.  <br /> <br />My personal favorite song is the title track, \\"5150.\\" I have no idea why this still isn't recognized as one of their best efforts. Sammy's vocals are spot on, and really convey the angst of the song. Eddie, of course, weaves his magic as dramatically as ever.  <br /> <br />To me, this is one of the finest albums I own. It's still a rocker, and it holds up very well.
B000G73UEU|5.0|Discovered this concert film at netflix. Loved it so much I purchased the audio cd. Leonard Cohen's music is wonderful of itself, but the new interpretaions by this diverse group of young singers made it all new again. Hearing these \\"next-generation\\" performers has opened a whole new world to me. Rufus and Martha Wainwright, Teddy Thompsom, Nick Cave, Jarvis Cocker, Beth Orton, Anthony are all major talents! And the few elders on the CD, The McGarrigles, Perla Batala, Julie Christensen, and the U2 guys were a revelation performing this music!  Unfortunately, not all the songs on the movie are included in the audio cd. But what is there is exceptional!

B00005JPAO|4.0|Princess Diana has just died in a terrible car accident, all of London mourns, what exactly should the royal family do, especially when it is well known Diana and Queen Elizabeth II did not get along? According to the Queen, the royal family should show reserve. It is a private matter. Not to mention the issue involving Diana's children. They should not be exposed to the media and the circus which surrounds the situation. No emotion should be shown. A sort of stiff upper lip mentality. That is after all, what Americans think of when we think of the British, isn't it?<br /><br /> There is a scene fairly early in the picture when Queen Elizabeth II break down and sheds tears. The camera never shows us her face. The Queen would never express such feelings in public, it simply would not be decent, so the camera man and director Stephen Frears give her, her space.<br /><br /> It is because of moments such as this that make \\"The Queen\\" seem a bit too real. It is a docudrama but somehow it feels like a documentary, we know it's not, but the movie, especially screenwriter Peter Morgan, seem to know too much. How did they acquire this information? This is what I became most impressed with as I watched \\"The Queen\\".<br /><br /> If you haven't heard \\"The Queen\\" tells the story of how the royal family treated the public outcry concerning Princess Diana's death and the relationship between the Queen and the newly elected Prime Minister, Tony Blair, whom many felt correctly judge the public's \\"mood\\" in how to handle the tragic accident.<br /><br /> Much praise has been thrown Helen Mirren's way for her performance in the film, and she is quite good. Despite playing a real person Mirren doesn't give us an impersonation. She adds something more to the role, truly trying to flesh out the character (I say character because essentially that is what it is. This is a work of fiction despite everything). Some might say Mirren isn't doing much, there is too much restraint. They have a point, but, that's the way the character is presented to us. It is how this character would behave. Therefore it cannot be considered a fault. Instead it is an asset. A tribute to Mirren's performance.<br /><br /> But Mirren isn't the only performance worth watching or talking about. The entire cast, from Michael Sheen as Tony Blair, to James Cromwell as Prince Philip and Alex Jennings as Prince Charles. Each actor makes us believe they are the characters they are playing. Cromwell, while a bit more emotion (usually expressing anger) gives the some kind of subtle performance as Mirren. Each character required the same approach.<br /><br /> But is there more than meets the eye to Frears' film? Maybe. Would it be out of line to suggest \\"The Queen\\" is really about Britain's class system? Blair, who won an election based on the assumption he would offer change and fight for the middle-class is constantly at odds with the Queen, as she represents the \\"establishment\\", the exact people Blair was voted in to take on. But Blair serves as buffer. His character is designed to show us both sides. Without one side, the country would be lost. Gone would be it's history and tradition and without the other, gone would be optimism. The two need each other.<br /><br /> Frears for his part he does a great job balancing all of this and gives the film just the right pace. \\"The Queen\\" never overstays her welcome. While not one of my favorite directors, he has nonetheless directed many entertaining films, which also take on class systems (\\"Dirty Pretty Things\\", \\"The Grifters\\") but here I think he has outdone himself. This is one of his very best works!<br /><br /> Bottom-line: A docudrama that presents itself as a documentary. At times we wonder, how do the filmmakers know this stuff?

B000JJRIN4|5.0|I have liked Gwen Stefani since No Doubt. I assumed that she'd always have a career. But I wasn't sure when it was going to be a dance/club route she was going. It's a really good album. It moves well and each song is listenable. They might not all be great lyrically, but as tunes, they are very good. Throw it in the iPod and listen during the shuffle. Maybe one or 2 songs are worthy of a playlist but they are all above expectations...
B000NDIAWY|5.0|Brandi's second album is totally awesome.  She exceeds her fine first effort with 13 new tracks that speak from the heart.  Her lyrics and notes are unsurpassed in this genre.  Brandi is a young woman, but she speaks to fans of all ages.  If you get an opportunity to see Brandi live take it, she is even more fantastic in person.....very real, no glitz, not full of her self..... but ready to share a musical talent that always impresses.

Made me dust off the Santana, Steely Dan, Van Morrison and Sinatra - believe it or not.

It's a great Sean Connery is the crumudgeonly grandpa next door role (as opposed to the Sean Connery action man role). And the kid is great. You will remember his BMW speech forever.
0446615625|5.0|A great book about an eccentric group of buddies in the Washington DC area.  They could be any group of friends, like you and me, that just happen to be in very interesting places, during suspicious times.  They use their individual talents to thwart the bad guys, who are very real and dangerous.  The story line is more than believeable and makes you wonder.  The liasons they make, leave you waiting for the next installment, but very pleased with the way everything is tied up in the end.  I can't wait to find out what they do with Jerry Bagger in the next book!
B00004RFFI|4.0|Sure most of the relationships and characters are one dimensional, but they're still loads of fun.  Sure you know what's coming, but it looks really amazing when it gets there.<br /><br />Twister is an action movie with a little romance and comedy thrown in, but it's really the relationship between the main two characters and the fun dialogue between all that make you want to watch this over and over again.<br /><br />As for realism, who cares, it's an action movie.  But to be fair as unbelievable as most of this looks tornados really can do most of the things that are seen.<br /><br />Overall, a fun ride.
B000023VR6|5.0|By 1999, Dr. Dre had gained the status of being one of hip hop's most important pioneers both as a rapper and a producer, the man behind such hip hop classics as [[ASIN:B00006JJ51 Straight Outta Compton]], [[ASIN:B00005AQF7 Doggystyle]], and his own trendsetting debut [[ASIN:B00005AQEQ The Chronic]]. At this point, he was already moving past the genre of g-funk that he had helped establish seven years earlier, instead focusing on his new Aftermath Records and promoting new artists like Eminem. On \\"2001,\\" Dre returns with a vengeance, transforming the sound of west coast hip hop once again. On [[ASIN:B00005AQEQ The Chronic]], Dre pioneered the smooth, laidback, rolling and woozy hip hop sound of g-funk, which would be relentlessly imitated for the next decade. So with this album, Dre reestablishes himself as a musical genius, defining a whole new style of west coast rap that set the bar for the coming years. Gone are the lovable slow hollow basslines and whining synths, the female vocalists, and the extensive p-funk samples, in favor of a fast, angrier sound. The beats on \\"2001\\" are creative and original, musically the west coast's most important album of the last decade. The beats are more electronic and futuristic sounding, they are upbeat and more menacing. A deeper listen shows just how rich the productions are musically; the electronic instrumentals and thumping bass are very catchy and addictive. Even the skits have great beats. Lyrically, Dre and his crew of LA rappers are furious and explicit, full of threats, gang-throwing, and gun talk. Like on [[ASIN:B00005AQEQ The Chronic]], almost every song is sort of a posse-cut, and the frequently featured guests include Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, Eminem, Kurupt, and Hitman, as well as single cameos by numerous others. The verses are not for the weak at heart, but this is gangsta rap at its most provocative and entertaining. The consistency is quite admirable, there's no slow songs or any odd cuts, just straight hardcore the whole time. You know what a classic this is because every single song is so recognizable, I've heard at least half of these songs on the radio at one point or another, they're such epic anthems. Overall \\"2001\\" is an incredibly influential album and is tons of fun to listen to.<br /><br />Following an intro, the album begins with \\"The Watcher,\\" an eerie production featuring Knocturnal, a great start. Dre shows his dark sense of humor over a droopy, dark musical backing on \\"F... You,\\" featuring partner-in-crime Snoop Dogg and Devin the Dude. This is followed by the absolutely classic \\"Still D.R.E.,\\" one of his discography's finest songs. The beat is incredible, a hard-hitting bass heavy groove, and Snoop and Dre both spit great verses, asserting they remain the same gangstas from the early-90s, this song's a true anthem. \\"Big Egos\\" is a memorable, depressed collaboration with Hitman. My favorite song is \\"Xxplosive.\\" This beat is absolutely incredible, one of my favorites of all time. The blippy instrumental and the head-nodding bass are perfect, it's just so catchy. Nate Dogg and Kurupt both make inspired appearances on this hip hop classic. The furious \\"What's the Difference\\" has a very well known beat and threatening lyrics from Dre, Xzibit, and Eminem. The shorter \\"Lightspeed\\" showcases some space-age production. \\"Forgot About Dre\\" is the next classic, an infamous Eminem collaboration that immediately became an anthem. An incredible beat is covered with some of Dre and Em's angriest lyrics. Both lyrically and musically, this song embodies the entire album's quality, establishing a new force in rap. This is followed by the rap standard \\"The Next Episode,\\" arguably Dre's most famous single. The thumping, upbeat track has one of the most well-known instrumentals and simply fun rhymes from Dre and Snoop, giving way to Nate Dogg's classic \\"Holdup!\\" cadence. \\"Let's Get High\\" is fast and memorable, and the dreary \\"B... N...\\" is another unique collabo. \\"Murder Inc.\\" isa chilling narrative over an equally scary beat. The posse cut \\"Some LA N...\\" brings together west coast legends King Tee, MC Ren, Xzibit, and Knocturnal for one of the album's best songs lyrically. The unforgettable \\"Housewife\\" has an infectious beat and an inescapable hook, this song also appears on Kurupt's album [[ASIN:B000028TWH Tha Streetz Iz a Mutha]]. The simple yet satisfying \\"Ackrite\\" precedes the lovable \\"Bang Bang,\\" a gangsta anthem. The incessant gunshots and chanting are awesome. The album ends with the wonderful \\"The Message,\\" a conscious track dedicated to Dre's late brother. The sad lyrics are supported by music and vocals to match.<br /><br />\\"2001\\" is one of the most important albums of the last decade, breaking the mold and reinventing the sound of west coast hip hop. Dre once again proves his musical genius, and this album is a consistent and inventive masterpiece. This shouldn't factor into my review, but this album just has tons of sentimental value to me as well, I remember when this came out it seemed like every one of my friends was playing it all the time. \\"2001\\" is a must have for any fan of gangsta rap.is a chilling narrative over an equally scary beat.

0761944524|5.0|It's best statistic handbook I ever bought. 1. It is writen in good structure; 2. The concept is explained clearly; 3. it is practical. Reader can follow the instruction step by step. 4. the author is really nice guy! You can download his teaching ppt online for free; and you can donate some money to a charity fund if you think materials are useful. <br /> <br />In a word, it is a book deserving to have. You are supportting an author who try to teach statistics in an easier way.
0743496728|5.0|Another book to NOT miss by Jodi Picoult. With the recent dchool shooting going on, this is a very meaningful story. Kids obviously don't realize how bulling can cause such dire aftermaths. This book held my interest to the very end. I thought I had it figured out but I had't.
0974869449|5.0|I started learning Kanji a long time ago and recently my wife has been developing an interest in the Japanese language. As a resource for first-time learners, these flashcards are invaluable. Not only are they well-researched and good looking, they are also sturdy enough to allow for a lot of use. The cards have a lot of information on them, including cross-references to other similar-looking characters, examples and kun and on readings. If you're serious on learning Japanese, these are a must have!

0316010669|3.0|When I picked up this book, I was hoping by the end that I would be better equipped to make those \\"thinking without thinking\\" sort of judgments more reliably. While there was a lot of interesting and thought provoking stuff in the book, I felt like I missed the \\"meat\\" I was after, in that there was no lesson in how to apply everything. Mostly, the book just prompted me to look further into other research, which Gladwell summarized in the book.

B000063COX|4.0|Iron Maiden has proven to be by far the most enduring band of the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal, and their first release amply demonstrates why. Many of the tunes on this 1980 release are staples of the Maiden live show to this day. <br /> <br />First the performances. Bassist Steve Harris (who also did almost all of the songwriting) is absolute dynamite, his highly distinctive style already firmly in place at this early stage. His basslines aren't just there to keep the bottom full; the songs are built around them. Guitarist Dave Murray is just as extraordinary, whipping out the trademark minor-key shred with fire and precision. The drummer, Clive Burr, is absolutley amazing. Unfortunately he'd only play on the first three albums; I like him better than Nicko Mcbrain who would later take his place. The other musicians are somewhat less impressive. Dennis Stratton is a good guitar player but comes off sounding second-best next to Dave Murray, and Paul D'ianno's raspy vocals make my ears tired after awhile (I can't stand Brian Johnson of AC/DC either). This album was also the unfortunate victim of a low-budget recording and a second-rate producer, resulting in a muddy-sounding mix that's completely lacking in depth.  <br /> <br />Despite these problems, what really makes this album work is the songs. Classics abound, with kick-butt rockers like \\"Prowler\\", \\"Sanctuary\\", the great instrumental \\"Transylvania\\", and a killer ballad in \\"Strange World\\". The best tracks, however, are the ones that demonstrate Maiden's emerging progressive side, those being the gorgeous \\"Remember Tomorrow\\" and the absolute masterpiece \\"Phantom Of The Opera\\". Without a doubt the worst song here is \\"Iron Maiden\\" which has unfortunately become a staple of the band's live show, and \\"Running Free\\" comes off a bit lightweight as well. <br /> <br />Overall the good far outweighs the bad, and although the best was still to come, this recording stands as one of the finest debuts in history. Up the irons!
B00004ZELJ|4.0|I highly recommend this product if you7 are or were ever a Backstreet fan.The show is very personal and yet energetic.The best concert I have seen.
B000NA77YO|3.0|I don't typically buy, review, or recommend compilations. I got this one (released April 2007) because of the three new tracks. I normally don't do that, either (usually the new tracks they put on compilations are of b-side quality at best) but Dio-era Sabbath is a special exception for me. I wasn't disappointed; the new songs are great. \\"Ear In The Wall\\" is the standout.    I'm not sure who picked the older songs for this, but they weren't using their ears. For starters WHERE is \\"Sign Of The Southern Cross\\"??? This isn't just a personal favorite of mine; most Dio and Sabbath fans I know consider that one special and in fact the band is playing it on their current reunion tour. Granted that it's a long song but I would have happily given up both \\"Turn Up The Night\\" and \\"Lady Evil\\" for it. It seems bizarre to me that those two songs were included here, to be honest. Neither is bad, but neither is greatest hits material either. I was also rather shocked by the under-representation of the Dehumanizer album. Three songs is not nearly enough. There are six songs here from Heaven And Hell, four from Mob Rules, and three from Dehumanizer. NOT well-balanced. I would have preferred to see four from each album (remember they'd have to have one song less in order to include \\"Sign Of The Southern Cross). Perhaps this: \\"Neon Knights\\", \\"Heaven And Hell\\", \\"Die Young\\", and \\"Children Of The Sea\\" from Heaven And Hell; \\"The Mob Rules\\", \\"Voodoo\\", \\"Sign Of The Southern Cross\\", and \\"Falling Off The Edge Of The World\\" from Mob Rules; and \\"After All (The Dead)\\", \\"TV Crimes\\", \\"I\\", and \\"Computer God\\" from Dehumanizer. This would be much more representative of this lineup's total recorded output.    My recommendation is this; download the new tracks (legally!!!) and buy the albums individually. There are only three of them and they are all great metal masterpieces so you really can't go wrong.
B000002C25|4.0|oasis is a very talented British rock band reminds me of the early days of the British invasion of the sixties somewhat like a mix of the Beatles and the Rolling stones.Be here now by oasis,is a overall good album so if you,re   into British rock? I recommend it and give it  4 stars.
B000002L7V|4.0|Dio's third album, the 1985 release Sacred Heart, is the subject of a great deal of controversy amongst fans. While most seem to find it lacking, it's actually a very good album, although certainly not as solid as the first two.    THE PACKAGING: Instead of the demon mascot Murray that graced the jacket art on the previous two Dio releases, sacred heart instead features a dragon inside of a crystal ball. Very cool. The minimalist liner notes include a track listing, credits, and printed lyrics for the title track.     THE BAND: The same band that played on Last In Line is also featured here. Vinnie Appice pounds the skins, Jimmy Bain thumps the low notes, Claude Schnell tickles the ivories, Vivian Campbell twiddles the strings, and Ronnie James Dio shrieks to the heavens.    THE SOUND: This would be the last album to feature guitarist Vivian Campbell. While his playing is still excellent, it has to be said that it lacks the exuberance of his work on Holy Diver and Last In Line. He sounds as if he isn't really interested anymore. The virtuoso rhythm team of drummer Vinny Appice and bassist Jimmy Bain lays down solid, powerful and inventive grooves every bit as effectively as in the past, and Ronnie James Dio sings like the metal god that he is. Keyboardist Claude Schnell is featured much more prominently than before, making his presence felt with arching chords and textural bits that add a great deal to the semi-mystical aura. It should be noted that the increased use of keyboards is one of the major criticisms that fans level at this album, but I think in this case it works well. The album is well-recorded with RJD doing an excellent job on the production. For all the people clamoring for a remaster I'll simply quote Bob Dylan: \\"Modern production makes records sound bad.\\" The recording is fine as it is.    THE SONGS: The songwriting isn't as consistent here as it was on the first two releases but fortunately there's a lot more good than bad; the first six songs areall great. \\"King Of Rock'n'Roll\\" is a great opener, the epic \\"Sacred Heart\\" features a standout vocal performance and a killer riff, and \\"Another Lie\\" just rocks. The best track here is \\"Rock'n'Roll Children\\", with a great melody and a lyrical theme similar to earlier classics like \\"Invisible\\" or \\"One Night In The City\\". I even like \\"Hungry For Heaven\\" despite it's somewhat pop-oriented flavor. \\"Like The Beat Of A Heart\\" is a great stomp-rocker. Things fall off a little bit after this. \\"Just Another Day\\" and \\"Fallen Angels\\"  are good tracks but nothing special and \\"Shoot Shoot\\" is really pretty dreadful.    THE BOTTOM LINE: Of the three albums to feature the original Dio lineup this one is definitely the weakest. But that doesn't make it bad; the first two were metal masterpieces and NOBODY that I can think of maintains those kind of standards for three consecutive albums. Buy this for sure; the first six tracks will make you happy, the next two aren't that bad, and who knows... some people actually like \\"Shoot Shoot\\".

B0001WE6U2|2.0|I bought this lens hood as a replacement for one that fell off and was lost while I was carrying the camera around.  As a lens shade, it does the job of keeping light off the front element satisfactorily, and shows very little vignetting even at 18mm, but the bayonet attachment is not as positive as one would expect, given the overall lens and camera quality.
B000002KIT|5.0|I had this album on vinyl as a teenager.  Bought it for a trip down memory lane - not always a good idea.  Unlike other youthful memories, this stands the test of time.  Thin Lizzy were a great band - huge in the UK, not so in the US.  This album shows them at their peak and what a talent Phil Lynott was - albeit a wasted one. <br /> <br />If you like \\"Boys are Back in Town\\" and want to try Thin Lizzy, this album is a better way to go than any Greatest Hits collection.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|I absolutelly love this actress (Sigourney Weaver)! But whose dumb idea was it to replace The Irreplaceable (David Attenborough) on the tv show? I tried    to watch it on tv, I did my best, honestly, but I couldn't for no other reason than that she sounded so boring, bored, disinterested, in \\"I'd rather be doing movies\\" sort of way. I don't know may be I am just spoiled by all those other documentaries Sir David narrated.  Needless to say I was ecstatic beyond words to find out that DVD that I bought was an original version and was, indeed, narrated by Sir David Attenborough. This DVD is a must-have. If I could I would give it 10 stars.

B000002B1M|5.0|\\"Love changes and best friends become strangers...\\"    If there's one thing I've learned in regards to Rap music and the internet, it's NEVER follow what reviews say.  (Almost seems contradictory being that this is a review itself, I know.)  I've checked reviews for albums I revered greatly that gave undeserving horrid ratings to; just as I've seen reviews for albums I was in disgust of, having high ratings.      My point is that no matter what some sites might say, It Was Written is not only the most underrated album to have ever come out, but it's also the best, period.  I really don't wish to hype it up too much; I'd rather you listen for yourself.  Nas' display of his lyrical prowess and masterful flow on these haunting beats, along with the guest appearances, makes for me an outstanding work of art.      Back when this album was released, some were disappointed due to it having a different tone from Illmatic's more mellow vibe; and so reviews bashing it were spewed about, and others just jumped on the bandwagon in saying this is a bad album.      Although I must say, though my favorite, this is not a \\"perfect\\" album.  I could do without the opening \\"slave\\" sequence - which seems almost comical and not serious, and would've rather them just had Nas and AZ talking over that beat for the intro.  Also I'm not quite fond of the song \\"Black Girl Lost\\", due to its awful production.  But I honestly don't know how anyone could listen to tracks like \\"The Message\\", \\"I Gave You Power\\", \\"Take it in Blood\\", \\"Nas is Coming\\" (excluding the annoying chorus), \\"Affirmative Action\\", \\"Suspect\\", \\"Shootouts\\", \\"Live Nigga Rap\\", and \\"If I Ruled The World\\", and say that it's weak, and not amongst the top tiers in not only Nas' catalogue, but in Rap music in general...
B00008A7QK|5.0|Thank you for the CD.  This classic piece of rock history came to me in great shape and in a timely manner.  This second copy was for a friend.  He loved it as much as I do.  Thank you.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't normally watch television, and ended up putting Firefly on my Netflix cue out of curiousity.  I am now a total fan of this series -the writing is phenomenal, the story lines really keep you involved and wanting more.  The ensemble of actors is fabulous - they have incredible chemistry working together.  The FX are great, the musical score exceptional for a television series.  You will by turns find yourself laughing, crying, breathless and on the edge of your chair.  I wish I had known about Firefly when it was airing on Fox.  I would have been in the legion of fans trying to keep the series on the air.  They didn't even get to finish a whole season, and they came up with a classic.  If you like sci-fi and quality, you can't go wrong here.  You'll be watching these over and over.
075640407X|5.0|This is the kind of book I find very rarely, and it is the reason I read so many books - the hope to find a story this wonderful.  From the beginning pages the story and the characters are captivating.  The world created is fanciful and entertaining, and I was hooked.  As the story progressed, I started to slow down so I could take it all in, and so that it wouldn't end too soon.  This is a must read for anyone who enjoys adventure, fantasy or just a great story.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|What can I say?  Serenity is awesome, just like the series, Firefly, that it expands upon.  The characters are fresh, alive and intense, the special effects are great, the writing is superb.  If you like sci-fi, you won't be the least disappointed.  Get it now!

B00001U0E1|5.0|Although the history may incomplete, this film transports one back to the glory days of Elizabeth 1, who we owe so very much to; her father might also be in line for a little credit! On one hand, it is frightening to think of living back then, but the excitement of what was happening is amazing. <br />Since Bill's complete known works can be downloaded via the Guttenberg project, this movie can lead to an obsession with all things English. When we realize how much that small piece of real estate has contributed (Calculus, Physics, Chemistry......) it seems like a valid obsesssion. <br />There would also seem to be an important political lesson, which many need to go back and consider, if they can read...hint hint.

B000MV9026|5.0|I loved the movie, it had me swaying to the music and singing right from the beginning. I loved the characters.. I chose to get it in full screen version due to I'm not a big fan of the wide screen version.. I loved the movie from beginning to end.. I watched it along with my parents and they're a tough bunch when it comes to movies, But my mother loved it especially, I think she must have laughed and kept a smile through the whole movie.. My fathter, whose an even tougher critic to watch movies with enjoyed it also.. I even him him laughing a few times and saw him smile, so all and all, it was worth the buy.. Thanks amazon!
B000MV9026|4.0|Happy Feet is a movie that would draw attention to parents and children alike and both can associate with the issues in this movie. How a parent may be embarrassed by a child being different from the norm. Or the child seeing nothing wrong with talents or being different if everything else is the same. The movie is entertaining.
B00005QIPH|4.0|I remember getting this back in 2001 when everyone and their dog were stumbling all over themselves proclaiming The Strokes saviors and future of rock and the best thing since sliced bread. Unfair as it may be, all that hideous overexposure and ubiquity only served to set me against The Strokes because personally I just couldn't see what the fuss was about. Now that the hype around the band has dimmed and the music press are busy pushing other fresh new things into the spotlight, I could finally enjoy \\"Is This It\\" for what it is, a highly enjoyable collection of energetic, catchy guitar songs that borrow heavily from the rock'n'roll past - Television, Stooges - but still manage to sound modern and fresh. The album does start to suffer from sameness by the end especially when it comes to Julian Casablancas' monotone slacker delivery, but it's not much of a problem since \\"Is This It\\" wraps itself neatly in just over 35 minutes. Original? No, just like 99.9999% bands (some of them great) out there. Fun to tap your foot to? Heck yeah.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Much has been written here regarding the magic that was created that night in Albert Hall as a tribute to George by those who obviously loved him.  Kudos to Clapton to have arranged an incredible evening of sight and sound from the grand venue, to the song selection and arrangements.  It was overwhelming for me to watch the concert unfold from the Indidan compositions, to Monty Python's contributions, and finally expressions of love from his good friends in life who played with him throughout his potent musical career.   You realize what kind of man he was as you listen to his songs filled with hope and compassion that were performed flawlessly and respectful to the way George recorded them.   <br /> <br />I was continually surprised by the choice of songs, and thought I'd never hear any of them live---ever!  By Dahni joining Lynne, and Petty for \\"Handle With Care,\\" I was dumbfounded.  I was sucked in to Paul's sentimental ukelele solo of \\"Something\\" that exploded into the best full blown rendition I ever heard; and yes Clapton's and McCartney's harmony in the refrain brought me to tears.   <br /> <br />Along with Sam Brown's vocals which were astounding on \\"Horse to Water\\" and Joe Brown's finale \\"See You in My Dreams,\\" was the chilling piano introduction to \\"My Guitar Gently Weeps.\\"  Clapton had played the lead guitar bridge on the White Album version as a guest performer, which was unheard of at the time.  To play along with Ringo on drums and Paul on piano, Clapton brought us as close to heaven and George as we could get that night in Royal Albert Hall.  A perfect celebration for an extraordinary man.
B000MV9026|5.0|I bought Happy Feet for an 11 year old neighbour for his birthday and he was kind enough to loan it to me.  I know he enjoyed it very much as all of his friends who visited him wanted to see the movie as well.   <br /> <br />What a charming movie - loved the story line and the graphic were very imaginative and very well done.  My only disappointment was that the \\"whale scene\\" in the Special Features Menu was not put into the movie.  I liked the message of humans stopping their fishing in the area so that the penguins would not die of starvation.  It would be nice if real life echoed that sentiment, but perhaps that message in the film will reach someone out there.  It's just a super movie all round.
1400064287|2.0|(I intended to give this 5 stars, not 2.  However, the edit function did not permit a change in the star scale so please note - my rating is 5, not 2 stars.  DBA)<br /><br />Sometimes, the value of a book obtains from how the lessons or insights therein can be applied in other ways.  That was the case for me in reading this work by the Heath brothers.  Here is what I wrote--the latter past of the essay is a summary of the main contents.<br /><br />Good ideas often have a hard time succeeding in the world. Yet the ridiculous Kidney Heist (urban legend) tale keeps circulating, with no resources whatsoever to support it. Why? Is it simply because hijacked kidneys sell better than other topics? Or is it possible to make a true, worthwhile idea circulate as effectively as this false idea?<br />~Chip and Dan Heath, Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die.<br /><br />I sometimes get discouraged. Despite all my essays and newsletters, speeches, books and media appearances, the wellness message has not made a big impression. People certainly are not a lot healthier than they were before my first book came out over 30 years ago. Worse, I have not become a wealthy celebrity, despite all the opinions I have offered here and there and everywhere. This is an outrage and I wish I did not have to put up with it.<br /><br />How do I manage to stay happy, cheerful, fit and productive, despite the reluctance of the public to adore me? Simple. I try not to think about the injustice of it all. This works quite nicely, until I come upon a discouraging word -- or two. This happened recently when my buddy Bob Ludlow responded to an essay I had sent for his review. After the usual pleasantries and kind words, Bob provided the following \\"tough love:\\"<br /><br />One more point that I have made before: Your platform, so to speak, is wellness; and everything you write, as far as I know, is within a wellness context (make that a somewhat expanded wellness context). Sometimes I get the sense that this limits you, that you could say \\"it\\" better and more effectively if you dropped the confines of your wellness-guru role and just wrote what you wanted to say, how you wanted to say it.<br /><br />Let me put this in a close-to-sixty-eight-year perspective: I can't think of a single time I have ever heard anyone I know utter the word \\"wellness\\" other than you. I have seen the word in print from time to time, but it's always in a phony advertising context.<br /><br />So I ask you, are you not limiting your potential audience by linking your thoughts and insights to the mostly ignored \\"wellness movement?\\" Especially considering that your take on most issues seems to be a minority position within the movement you helped to found?<br /><br />My impression is that wellness just hasn't caught on; it's not something people think about; it's not in the forefront of many people's consciousness, and it probably won't be for the foreseeable future. Nobody's saying, or thinking, \\"Wow, a new wellness book has just been published; I sure hope Barnes and Noble still has a copy left.\\"<br /><br />Question: Is working within the confines of wellness limiting you? Is it limiting your potential audience?<br /><br />As I told you, except for your writings, which I value and enjoy, I could not care less about the rest of \\"wellness.<br /><br />As you might imagine, this sparked some reflection, if not an immediate sense that I needed some career counseling. Yet, being less than a year and a half from seventy years of age, it might be a little late in the game for me to apply to medical school, seek leading roles in Hollywood, try out for the New York Yankees or get started on any of the other fun careers I fantasized about when I was in high school.<br /><br />I wrote to Bob and explained that he provided a valuable service. He motivated me to think about some important issues personally as well as about the future of the wellness movement. I did not disagree with anythinghe described. Perhaps I am indeed too closely identified with the word \\"wellness, which could be off-putting. However, I also pointed out that I do write what I want to say, how I want to say it. I also insisted that I try not to come off like a guru of wellness or guru of anything else.<br /><br />I admitted his assessment was scary and that I needed to break out of the wellness box, that the concept has not and probably won't catch on (in time, at least, for me to benefit from it). The burden is on me, I realize, to think about ways to escape the wellness confines that limit my potential audience.<br /><br />I told Bob his advice was welcomed and appreciated even if it scared me, particularly because it reminded me of the error of my ways and futile career paths!!!!<br /><br />Shortly after this exchange with Bob Ludlow, and just in time to redirect my hopeless career path, I came across a new book entitled, \\"Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die\\" by Chip and Dan Heath. This work suggests that there are six principles that might make my message much more effective, thereby eventually harnessing the wellness concept to change (and maybe even saving) the world. Or something. The six principles are:<br /><br />Simplicity -- Strip an idea to its core, prioritize and create proverbs if possible that are both simple and profound. The Golden Rule is the ultimate model of simplicity.<br /><br />Unexpectedness -- To get an audience to pay attention and maintain their interest, I must violate their expectations. This involves being counterintuitive.<br /><br />Concreteness -- Ideas must be communicated in terms of human actions, sensory information. I must avoid jargon (for examples, mission statements, synergies, strategies, visions) that can seem meaningless. I need concrete images, the kind that turn up in memorable urban legends (guys with missing kidneys waking up in ice-filled bathtubs after messing around with women not their wives, for instance).<br /><br />Credibility -- People are more likely to embrace wellness ideas if believable images are conveyed that give the wellness appeals a convincing stature. Memorable phrases (\\"Before you vote, ask yourself if you are better off today than you were four years ago\\", for example) can do the trick.<br /><br />Emotions -- Why should people care? You have to make readers or a live audience feel the message, or something, such as disgust at the unhealthiness of one thing or another or resentment at the duplicity of the villain depicted.<br /><br />Stories -- Get people to act by telling stories to build a richer, more complete feel for the situation or mentally rehearse what will have to be done. This will enable an audience to respond more quickly and effectively when the real thing is encountered in daily life.<br />The authors of Made to Stick offer these insights as the six principles of successful ideas. In a single sentence, they review these six keys that I can use to break out of the doldrums of wellness:  \\"Create messages that are simple and unexpected and concrete and credentialed and that contain an emotional story.\\" That's it. How hard can that be?<br /><br />Well, we'll see. If you spot me on Oprah or on late night with Jay or Larry in the weeks to come, you will know I figured it out. Otherwise, look for more essays right here forevermore or until I wear out, whichever comes first.<br /><br />Meanwhile, stay well and, like me, look on the bright side of life, whether or not anyone's paying attention.be off-putting.

1427200246|2.0|Perhaps the most simplistic business fable yet. It's nothing more than \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\" for dummies. If you're manager in a fast-changing business,  and have people working for you who are unable to comprehend \\"Cheese\\", I'd suggest you either buy them this book, or screw-up the courage to fire them.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|this movie is totaly grate, special fx, script, adaptation, the edition of the storys keep the atention of all public. <br />if you like action movies, this is one of the best. <br />Robert Rodriguez and Tarantino, this names says all.
B000IU3Y3W|4.0|This release is a big improvement to what was already largely available in the bootleg arena.  These dates didn't circulate heavy but there was material available from this era.  The sounds quality is excellent.  Much has been made of the DVD imagery lacking, and it does, its rolling B&W pics.  The DVD is all about the sound.  The playing is just as good and its really nice to have vintage version of Winterlong and Wonderin'. <br /> <br />
B00004W221|5.0|Excellent movie and the quality was excellent. I would recommend this movie to any sports fan.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|Then you'll want this too, again, there is alot of 71 solo Neil bootlegs out there but none have this sonic crispness or even this strength of performance.  The DVD does have some video but it is grainy, again the DVD is about the sound that a DVD can offer.  The clip of Neil at his ranch is priceless.
B000AP04NI|5.0|The music is great as well as the singing and acting. This movie is a visual treat for the eyes and it has great dancing as well. If you love musicals (particularly those made in the 40's 50's and 60's) than you will love this movie. While this movie has a dark side for the most part it reflects the optimism that seems to be so much a part of the American character. Watch it you will enjoy it.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|I love this film.  I have loved this film since I saw it in the theater as a kid (much to my parents' chagrin!)  It was terrifying back then, and still gets me to this day.  The book is great too - Peter Benchley weaves a terrifying tale.  Given the period that this film was made, the effects are really amazing.  Directed by a young Steven Spielberg, it was a huge undertaking - stories about the filming are legendary - he triumphed over the difficulties and made a truly amazing movie.  I recommend the film to anyone that loves a great thriller, a great drama, a great adventure, a great script, great acting, and great film-making.  And the 30th Anniversary edition will please even the toughest critic &/or collector.  BUY IT TODAY!!
B000NVIXFK|5.0|First I would like to say that I have waited to give you a review of this album until I have actually heard it more than once unlike the others here. I must admit that it is a well written and performed piece of art.  I appreciate that Rush has stuck to its roots and given us music comprised of bass guitar and drums and not too much of the '80 style of their music with keyboards dominating the music.  It has gotten better with the second and third listen and I am now on the fourth time through.  So please ignore the reviews that were submitted the first week that say this album is not good.  It is fantastic so go out and buy it already!
B000NDIAWO|5.0|a pesar de como yo, muchos compramos el álbum original. el unico detalle. en este es la cancion welcome to hollywood pues la version original que suena mucho mejor en el disco de jay-z kingdome come deberian dejarlo asi.. todo lo demas le ponemos un 10-- como siempre.. solo ella es capaz de modificar y reconstruir nuevos ritmos..
0618680004|5.0|I read many reviews (and comments posted on Amazon) about this book which are absolute nonsense.  You might read that this book is sour, excessive, virulent and full of anti-religious zeal.  This is plainly false, since most of the tone of this book is actually the mixture of plain language and factual scholarship which is usual in Dawkins' essays (which you should read whatever your religious beliefs!).  Certain sections do have an emotional and indignant tone -- but I assume that any reader, believer or not, would be as indignant as Dawkins is when writing about some absolute religious horrors, like sectarian child abuse and indoctrination. <br />The initial half of the book is devoted to a scientific examination of the possible existence of God.  Arguments and counter-arguments for the existence of God have been discussed for centuries, but Dawkins' summary is excellent and up-to-date.  An intermediate series of chapters deals with the origin of religion and religious belief.  Here, Dawkins adopts his own, sharp, evolutionary view on this topic, and comes out with arguments and explanation far more elaborate and convincing than you might read in other, similar books (far superior, in my opinion, to Dennett's \\"Breaking the Spell\\").  The last chapters deal with religion and ethics, and are probably the most interesting and original contribution in this work -- They are, alone, worth this book's price.  In fact, Dawkins dares to question issues (like religious education for children) which are usually tacitly overlooked in our societies.  But this is what a scientist is morally bound to be: someone who is never tired of asking the very simple and basic questions, never takes something for granted, and always asks for rational arguments.  Even if you eventually disagree with Dawkins' opinions, every bit of this book is intellectually refreshing and stimulating.
B00005GL0W|5.0|An amazing album to listen to while on hallucinogens. I discovered this on a journey of my own and literally fell in love. I think this and Revolver are the most underrated Beatles albums.
B000KJU182|5.0|Warnervideo has done a remarkable transfer of this classic to the DVD format.  It would be welcome addition to your DVD library. A splendid film and a great book.
0375831002|5.0|We are reading this book for book club, and it's wonderful.  I kept wondering as I was reading it why it's classified as a \\"young adult\\" book, because it's got plenty of difficult material in it.  I finally decided it's simply because the protagonist is a \\"young adult.\\"  It's a great book that I would recommend wholeheartedly, but have some tissue on hand.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|Great movie. Loads of special features including deleted scenes and alternate ending. Theres heaps of movie trailers, but no Rocky Balboa trailers.
B000KGGLCU|1.0|I don't receive the DVD madonna confenssion tour, I wanna to know what happen whit the dvd. when I wil recive I send mi opinion
0618680004|5.0|[[ASIN:0618680004 The God Delusion]]  brilliant discussion of the subject of science and religion
B000065BPB|4.0|I like almost everything about these headphones.  Terrific sound quality, tight yet comfortable design, and good passive noise-cancelling.  Why only 4 stars?  They look bulky when they're on your head.  Since most people are sitting alone when using headphones it doesn't really matter, but they are not aesthetically superior.  Overall, though, a tremendous value at under $100.
B000AP04OM|5.0|I am REALLY GLAD that I purchased this movie!  The first disc comes with the movie, along with some introductory information from Julie Andrews, and a fun sing-along (karoke style with subcaptions.)  The second disc provides a fascinating documentary that provides an interesting look into the making of the movie, along with meeting the actual grandkids of the Von Trapp family, and much more!  One of my favorite portions of disc two was the reunion of Christopher Plummer, Julie Andrews and the actors that played the children.  They all have neat stories that you will find to be fascinating! <br /> <br />A piece of advice:  If you love musicals, BUY THIS MOVIE!!  It's worth it...
B000NDIAWY|5.0|It's been a long time since I found an album I truly loved, but this is one.  It'll be on the shelf with Tori Amos's Little Earthquakes And Antigone Rising's From the Ground Up as albums I can pop in years later and still love.
B00005JPGO|5.0|I thought this movie was excellent. I have known about these conflict diamonds for some time. Seeing this movie just reiterated why I do not ever want a diamond. The documentary on the second disc was another eye opener for me.
0753107082|4.0|This was a good book, the audio version is VERY Good. Some of the later books were better but this one gives you the beginning of the series.<br />If you are not made of money, go to [...] and join up, I think for [...] a month you get 1 book per month.<br />If you can afford it BUY THIS CD, if you like fantasy/scifi mixed with English comedy. It is like if Monty Python wrote a series. It is called the Discworld series. Based on the Discworld, a world that is a disk carried on the backs of 4 giant elephants who walk around on the back of great A'toun the world turtle. The people on the discworld are funny, there are wizards, witches, gods and regular people. Here is a link to the actual book.. [...]
B00005JMCW|5.0|This product is no longer available in stores, so I was happy to see that I could purchase it from Amazon.  It arrived at my home in just a few days and in perfect condition.  I have found Amazon a very convenient way to purchase items and am extremely pleased with the excellent service.
B000CNE164|5.0|Short on time. Just trying to offset a lone reviewer who gave this one star! Yes, this is a short album, but there's no filler. My favorite of Nina's albums.
B000NA28HU|5.0|This is a good representation of the first book of the trilogy.  I'm looking forward to seeing the second installment on the big screen.  I'm sure it's going to be a bit more complex to edit the material to 2 hours given all the material.  However, I can't wait for the next movie!
B000KF0NHU|4.0|This is a very good movie in high definition. The graphics are very detailed. It's in combo format (HD DVD & DVD Version in one disc). I recommend this for first time HD DVD buyers since you will be able to compare the clarity between standard DVD and HD DVD. You will be amazed on the picture improvement over the standard DVD.
B0000X61UU|5.0|I have been using this workout video since it was released in the early 90's.  My videotape was worn out so I bought the DVD.  This is a challenging, fun, athletic workout that focuses on strengthening your muscles.  The music and visual effects never get old.  Cindy is sweet and motivating.  Just looking at her beautiful body is motivating!  And it's really effective.  The first few times you do it, you won't be able to move the next day!  But before you know it, you'll look like Cindy.  It's a classic.
0316113077|2.0|I had eyed this book coming for quite some time - anticipating a book filled with wonderful cake designs that I could accomplish. Although a beautiful table top book, it did not deliver what I expected. Of all 218 pages, there were ONLY six cakes that even looked edible, and they were stacked cakes. The rest were centerpiece decorations that are amazing to LOOK at, but not eat. I do like the cupcake ideas and the techniques in cookie design. I know Elisa is one (if not the best!) cake decorator/designer, but as a cake decorator I was hoping for ideas and techniques. I think this book is great if people just want to see Elisa's work but aren't expecting anything else.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I love this movie.  It is a wonderful story and the main characters are very likable.  If you ever get a chance to see this one, do it--you will love it.  This is a movie you want to watch over and over.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Being a college student, I don't have a load of money to throw around trying to find a really nice pair of comfortable headphones with great sound.  I did my research on different brands, read quite a few reviews, and ended up taking my chances on this pair.  I absolutely love them.  I use them almost non-stop and it sounds like the musicians are in the room!  The sound clarity is unparalleled.  The volume does not need to be blasting to hear every instrument and soft note.  And best of all, these mute outside noises, so I can put them on while others are blasting a TV and I won't hear anything but my music.<br /><br />These headphones are not flimsy like others and hold up very well, but if I do break them, I will buy another pair immediately.  For the price and quality, this is an amazing deal.  Buy a pair!
B00004R9A4|5.0|I have seen the original movie release and this is the elongated version.  It has scenes in it that ended up being cut for the theaters.  I have always enjoyed this movie, but the elongated one is much more enjoyable
B000002JS0|5.0|While it may be true that all AC/DC albums sound the same, something about High Voltage really stands apart from the rest.  Maybe it's the fact that it's one of the bands first records that makes you really appreciate and recognize the raw guitar riffs and simple lyrics.  Maybe it's the distinct vocal sound, or the slightly muddy production.  Whatever it is, AC/DC would eventually have much greater success, but the early stuff really is catchy and worth owning.  Pick up High Voltage (HIGH voltage, rock and roll!)
B000FFJ81W|2.0|I'd love to rate this on the music alone. <br /> <br />Sadly, I haven't been able to LISTEN to it because I can't rip the CD on my PC to load into my iPod.  I've tried a DVD-RW drive and CD-ROM drive on two different PCs that rip discs with no problems...except these.  The dual-discs feel as if someone literally took a CD and a DVD and SuperGlued them together.  Shoddy. <br /> <br />I really regret not getting the standard CD version.
B000065K6N|5.0|After I saw Spirited Away I was interested in this type of movies. I am very satisfied with this movie. Highly recommended!
B000NIVJEU|4.0|I liked the movie, but I agree with others that say it could be better. One would expect a little more action in a title like this. Not my favorite, but still good enough to buy and watch more than once.
B000BJ7BCK|4.0|It's good to see Kurt Russell back in a Disney movie again. The story centers around a Super Hero Mom and Dad who send their son off to a special secret Super Hero school in the sky. The usual \\"high school\\" high jinks occur in this family friendly comedy with some new interesting twist. Lynda Carter has a small amusing role at \\"Sky High\\".
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is a must have title. Beautiful scenes, excellent HD quality. I've only watched the first two discs and I am already extremely satistfied with the purchase.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|I was one of many who did not run to theaters to see this film when released. I didn't want to spend over three hours watching a film I knew the ending to. I have since built a state of the art theater in my home with a 10 foot screen. This movies lives up to the hype and is a fine example of how to tell a story. A long movie that doesn't feel that long with exceptional cast,script and FX. Well worth buying the special edition DVD.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|I started with Spirited Away and got hooked immediately with these type of movies. Porco Rosso is great! Highly recommended.
0060723513|5.0|While missing a bus connection an N.C. I read the book from first page to last. I was meant to stay there and read the book. In my opinion great! We, as members of the American capitalist society have a lot to learn from the aborigenes....but will we? Are we able to sacrifice our living standarts and go back to very basics and a different mind set? I wish I could go \\"down under\\" and mingle with the aborigenes. <br />Sabina Horak
B000HIVOI2|5.0|One of my favorite titles. The HD transfer was excellent. I had the DVD and bought the Blu-Ray to get it in HD. I'm happy I did that.
0140143505|5.0|Definitely a must read book and a must see movie!!!! <br />I recommend first to read then to see. <br />Sabina Horak
B000J103PC|5.0|I liked this movie but not as much as I liked some of Meryl Streep's other movies. It has a great message for those who want to rise above all others in life. Good film overall.
B000057VV5|4.0|I had seen this film many years ago. <br />I had forgotten how much \\"questionable\\" language and the one incidence  <br />of inappropriate \\"finger\\" humor that there was. <br />I would not show this film to children. <br />What an enjoyable movie to be ruined by gratuitous PG13 language.
B00006JSS8|5.0|This is a great find. It has all the old songs I remember and more. I will treasure it forever.
0743454537|3.0|I've read several JP books now and they've all followed a similar pattern - she starts out with a great idea and the book goes downhill from then on.  However I have to say this book was going pretty much ok up to the end - ok I had problems with the multiple narrators and the totally unnecessary (and probably unethical) romance between the lawyer and the G.A.L but I could handle that.  Someone with epilepsy holding a driving licence?  (for a writer who takes herself so very seriously JP should do a little research) - but I was prepared to suspend disbelief because the she was still keeping to the main storyline.  However in the last few pages she blew the whole thing.  It was like she got tired of writing and decided to tie it up with a ridiculous ending, which doesn't even work as a tearjerker because she rushes through it in a few pages, without giving the characters time to react to it - and there we are several years in the future looking back on it.  It's like one of those awful films where you realise that the closing credits are about to roll, with anything being resolved in a satisfactory way.  It would have been a lot better if she had just stopped writing after the outcome of the court case and asked the reader to make up their own ending.
B000JLTRKE|4.0|This was a moving experience. From another country it is hard to realise the enormity of this deed.  It was brought to the screen with sensativity, <br />sensation without sensationalism, and showed the courage of ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.

0800141660|4.0|I have never read this particular book, so my review is based on the film alone. I enjoy period movies if they are done well with accurate costuming and settings that capture what life was like at the time.  I feel that this movie accomplished this well.  The costumes were authentic and interesting, the settings gave a real feel for the land and living on the land.  The scenery was beautiful.  I thought the casting was very well done with one exception.  I thought Hugh Grant was out of place and his performance was lame.  He detracted from the content of the movie for me.  On the other hand, I found Alan Rickman's performance to be believable and compelling.  In fact, I bought the DVD for his performance. As far as the content of the movie, I found it hurried along through many parts.  I wanted to spend more time on the scenes and enjoy the sequence of events without feeling bounced from part to part.  The editing of the scenes detracted from the natural pace of life at the time the story was set.
B00005JPFH|5.0|The problem with Spiderman is that he is a solitary super hero in perfect agreement with the animal he is embodying. But that limits his adventures a lot to dangling and swinging at the end of a spider thread. So he needs to be presented with some companions who are going to be his preys, if possible, if necessary. To make things even better an extra-terrestrial organism falls onto the earth with some meteor and this organism is going to invade that poor Spiderman and make him turn black, aggressive, vindictive, vain. He will then cause a lot of suffering by doing bad things for the pleasure of dominating people and things. He will also relive the death of his uncle in the most vengeful way and try to capture the supposed and convicted though not quite proved killer who has just escaped from his narrow prison cell. Then he will get into some riffraff with his supposed best friend who in his turn becomes vengeful about his father who was supposedly killed by Spiderman, though it was never proved. Add to that a little bit of technological magic to turn the escapee into a sandstorm and you have three fourth of the drama. The last fourth is a photographer who wants to become a star in the press and who cheats in order to do it with a fake Spiderman picture. He will be exposed. But that drama will not turn tragic because of some circumstances that will make the best friend realize he was dumb, that will make Spiderman free of his ET invader, that will even liberate the second host of the ET black invader. Bells will be the solutions, church bells of course, and a lot of luck too, and final forgiveness. Then the city will go back to its absolutely boring peacefulness. Yet the film is funny and packed with action, even if that action is slightly grandiloquent.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID

0385333846|5.0|Not much. On a re-reading, what is most impressive is how horror is communicated  so well in writing that is so understated . This is true of other great works on war, whether the Gettysburg Address or Washington's Farewell Address or An Irish Airman Forsees His Death. Understated and compressed---you don't need a lot to get to the core. If you have not read this book since high school or college, pull it out and read it again. I promise:it is worth it.

B000LAZDQA|2.0|This movie was actually very boring. The actors suck, the plot was thin and the character development wasn't up to par with the pathetic sob scenes. It's not funny either. And it's certainly not a realistic portrayal of sex in any sense of the word... there's a relatively hidden tiny minority that engage in this type of lifestyle. Watching this movie was like going to the zoo, but it wasn't enlightening in the least. Beware those who would rate it highly, they often are afraid to have any other opinion when a \\"controversial\\" movie like this comes along.
B000FSME1A|5.0|the Vietnam War, acid trips, and a great time is what this movie consists of. Beautifully directed and acted, this film shows the kinds of mental challenges faced by men at war. On top of that is one of the best war scenes in movies of all time. This particular DVD comes bundled with Apocalypse Now Redux, which is basically the uncut version of the original Apocalypse Now with a few extra scenes, and it has been remastered in video and sound quality. Absolutely beautiful video captivates all viewers and Dolby Digital remastered surround sound envelops the listeners, taking them far into Vietnam and Cambodia. All I can say is that if one collects films or likes films in any way, he or she should have this set immediately.
B0000028WD|4.0|Excelent Alblum, A chance to hear other well respected artists versions of some of Dylan's music. We all know Dylan's music, his own unique vocal and lyrical style which make his work, lyrics and music his own, Somewhat surprisingly to me, it confirms that good lyrics and music can be adapted to other artists styles and still remain good, if different in style and arrangements to the original versions. (Does Dylan every deliver any song in the same way twice ?.I think not) <br />The list of talent performering at this concert also shows the respect in which Dylan is held by his peers, world class talented artists queued for a chance to perform live Dylans material. Those who really know, It really works..

B000I0RNV6|5.0|I loved this movie. It is well done dispite the typical Italian artistic whimsical touches. The characters are all bigger than life, (whimsical at times), but loveable. The story line is very good and reveals the life style changes in this Sicilian town as prosperity overtakes poverty after WWII. It is a \\"Must see\\" movie. It is the story of rags to riches set in post war Sicily. <br />My only problem is that I have seen three, (Count them), different endings to this movie. The endings are all quit good, but disturbing because I liked them all and had to see the three versions to understand what really happened, or could have to the hero. Incidentally, I have not viewed the \\"Directers Cut\\" yet; I have no idea how it will end.  <br /> <br />Phillip A. Purpura <br /> <br />
B000NQR7NO|5.0|These british lads are smart, fast, and energetic. Their first cd, a huge hit in England, was a breath of fresh air into modern rock music and Alex Turner, their lead singer, is a songwriter that is simply ingenious in his song-crafting ways.  <br />The new cd is amazing and you should go buy it now <br />505, d is or dangerous, and of course fluorescent adolescent are my favorite songs on the cd
6304884419|5.0|This has to be one of the best time period movies ever made. I have not known anyone who didn't agree with this opinion. The acting is great as is the directing and story line. The moral message is very clear and to the point: \\"We must all make life choices and live, (Or die), with the consequences\\" <br /> <br />The action is continuous and riveting; you will not want this movie to end. The characters are real and grow on you. The humor is ethnic, as is the premise. <br /> <br />It is obviously based on Chazz's experiences growing up in the Bronx. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this movie. <br /> <br />Phillip A.

B000NVIXFK|4.0|wow!!! i just read alot of the reviews for s&a and it appears the boys have struck a up a bit of controversy with some of us here.well here is my 2 cents on this cd.i am a 26 year long hardcore rush fan.snakes and arrows is hands down their best work in at least 14 years.the production alone is probably their best ever (vapor trails was a sonic disaster!!!!)i cant stop listening to this cd.i find it to be an emotionally moving listen. yes it does have a somewhat negative theme that questions faith, and paints a bleak outlook on the world in ways that are not found on earlier rush albums BUT!!!! does anyone really expect Neil to be the same ever again after the horror he went through 10 years ago??? i don't, and thats o.k with me.i am a christian and songs like \\"faithless\\" and \\"the way the wind blows\\" don't offend me at all. Neil is just pouring his heart out about some things on his mind.musically this cd shines.Alex does really creative, powerful playing here. Geddy's playing is real smooth and melodic,and Neil does some of his best work too.this is the first time in many years that i've gotten this excited over a rush album (the last time was \\"HOLD YOUR FIRE\\").my only points of criticism are that the meter of the lyrics are kind of awkward in spots (Geddy must have had a hard time writing melody to some of these songs)and the overuse of harmonies on the vocals. i would have liked to hear just one voice on some tracks...like the old days.this is a great new cd from one of the best bands in rock history. if you dont have this cd yet, get it... ....NOW!....WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?? .....GET OFF THE COMPUTER AND GET THIS CD ALREADY!!!!!!

1582701709|4.0|Possitive thinking is probably something we are all aware of, but something we probably need to be reminded of from time to time.  This book was just that for me - a good reminder that I should always think positive.  If you are not aware of the power of positive thinking and the law of attraction-then definitely read this book.  It's easy to read - Easy to understand and a good message that we should focus on the positive if we want positive things in our lifes!
B000N6TX1S|4.0|The only reason I rated this movie a 4 is the sound isn't that great on the DVD. I <br />had to pull a chair up close to the TV to hear it. But the movie itself is thought  <br />provoking, I was drawn into the story and believed it and loved the ending. The <br />action is quick paced and depicts the chaos of the time period.
0743496728|3.0|As usual Jody Picoult takes a topic that is very controversial and gives you all perspectives and angles-This is main reason I enjoy reading Picoult.  Unlike her other books, I had the ending to this book pretty much figured out from the beginning. The entire book was pretty predictable.  My favorite part of the whole book was the equation of happiness (happiness = reality/expectation) and it spurred hours of discussion in my office.  It is worth reading, but not my favorite Picoult.
B000G0O5N2|4.0|I bought it for collection since I've seen it many times. Hi def though is something else; it's a must see. This DVD in special has a lot of subtitles, including portuguese whitch is rare and great for us brazilians.
1401308201|4.0|Being an Australian and with only access to the broadway cast album of Stephen Schwartz's \\"Wicked\\" . . . .the show has yet to make it to Oz (Australia that is, not the magical...... you know what I mean).  I was more than eager to know more of this smash hit. \\"The Grimmerie\\" does not disappoint. Hard cover with a purposely \\"distressed\\" binding, this over 192 page book abounds with vivid color shots of the production, profiles of the characters by the actors who starred and most helpful for one who is yet to enjoy the show face to face, a condensed script linking the lyrics of each song. Whether you've seen the show, have only caught the cast album, or just heard on the grapevine; The Grimmerie, a Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Hit Broadway Musical is a must have.
B000MRA5NS|3.0|I've liked this new James Bond, I've been seeing them since Dr. No with Sean Connery and Ursula Andress. Although the final scene with the vilain is unworthy of a hero, (the manhood of Mr. Bond is clearly jeopardized) and the Venice sequence is somewhat confusing, this is one very good 007. I've downgraded my evaluation because of the absence of subtitles in a 25 gig media.

B000ERU928|5.0|Currently available from Amazon.com's French site for about $100 with shipping, this is simply an amazing collection. I agree with the consensus view that it is a smashing success, both artistically and economically. <br /> <br />As you'd expect the quality of the performances is somewhat uneven, but it's generally quite high, often as definitive as you will find for certain individual works. Most of the interpretations are historically informed, and most are on period instruments or copies of period instruments. The closer you can get to the timbres, performance techniques, ensemble sizes and intonation systems for which this music was written, the more listenable it is. <br /> <br />During my musical apprentice days, I naturally learned Bach's \\"canonical\\" masterpieces. But working my way through these complete surviving works over four months allowed me to discover a number of gems for the first time: some of the early experimental keyboard works, the lute music, the occasional jewels among the hundreds of arias and choruses comprising the church cantatas, the remarkable proto-minimalist BWV 922 keyboard Prelude, etc. To make the experience even more interesting, I assembled my favorites along the way into 22 CDs worth of highlights to which I've been putting myself and the kids to bed for the past several weeks. Sweet. <br /> <br />If you're a fan of Bach or Baroque music, do yourself a favor and indulge in this set. It's also a great gift for a music lover (at least at current Amazon.fr prices). <br />
B000O1799U|3.0|Although this is obviously a musical, there was a bit TOO MUCH singing and not enough emphasis on the plot.

B000N6TX1I|2.0|Children of Men stir so many emotions that it's hard to wrap your mind around all it's trying to convey, so let's start with the special features discussion.<br /><br />1st. How come the negative impact of globalization and capitalization is always told from leftist point of view? I'm certainly more liberal than conservative, but I'd still like to hear the conservative version of the argument.<br /><br />2nd. How come these views never credit mankind with its equally overwhelming successes? Industry, medicine and technology to name a few, have also provided us (the world at large) with some amazing advantages.<br /><br />3rd. How come we (civilized nations) never hold the leaders of depressed nations publicly accountable for the role they play in devastating their nations infrastructure? i.e. Africa, old Yugoslavia, etc. And since when throughout history have we not had a separation of some kind whether it be racial, religious or economic; whereby, one group profits at the expense of the other group?<br /><br />In Children of Men, Clive Owen is a reluctant semi-hero, who's approached by his social leader-ex-wife, played by Julianne Moore, to protect the world's only pregnant woman. Infertility; the result of global mismanagement, has turned pregnancy and youth into precious commodities (as if they weren't) and political fallout i.e. racism and the unequal division of wealth have made life hard. DAH! To tell this diverse of a story you need a series not a movie. We don't get a solid reason for any of the films major antagonists (racism, poverty and infertility). The full development of the characters is also missing. Why did these guys get involved with the movement? What forced the main characters to get divorced? What drove them to such different circumstances? We need the answers to these questions before we can fully believe their commitment. Because we didn't have this information the movie feels hollow, which is unfortunate given the level of talent enlisted in the film. Even though the special features segment is well developed, the film is overrated because it fails to properly develop the characters or story.special features segment is well developed, the film is overrated because it fails to properly develop the characters or story.

B000GFLE1S|4.0|How come British films seem to do more with less? Chiwetel Ejiofor is absolutely spot on in this upbeat, fun movie about trials and triumph.

0374105235|5.0|It is beyond comprehension the atrocities that are happening not only in Sierra Leone but elsewhere over the globe.  Ishmael Beah's first-hand account of tragedy and survival is a hauntinly difficult book to read but he speaks a truth that we can no longer choose to ignore.  He reaches deep into his soul to tells his story in a profoundly meaningful way, as only one who has experienced it can.  He is very eloquent in giving the plight of child soldiers a face and a name. A hero that will hopefully tell his truth over and over again until the world wakes up and delivers safety to the children.
B00005JXY3|4.0|This was the only movie in this series I wanted on DVD. This movie is very <br />romantic, and the exotic setting just makes it even more enjoyable. I <br />actually liked the movie because of the romantic part of the story rather than the fight scenes. Great DVD!
0553208845|4.0|Curious about Buddhism?  Hermann Hesse's famous novel SIDDHARTHA is as engaging an entryway into eastern thought as you can find in any religious/eastern philosophy section of a bookstore, because it is both accessible and true to the system of beliefs set down so long ago.<br /><br />No, it is not a how-to manual complete with advice on meditation techniques, but it does clearly show how the protagonist's journey from the selfish hell of pleasing the body to the heavenly rewards of pleasing the soul can lead to oneness, completeness, and a unique form of happiness.<br /><br />In our material, self-absorbed times, the message is especially appropriate.  At its nadir, Siddhartha's life is comprised of the pursuit of wealth and power, the sexual pleasure of women, the lovely reveries of fine wines, expensive clothes, obedient servants, sweet-smelling perfumes, rich meat and fowl, the siren call of gambling, and the false entitlement that is idleness.  In short, he measures success in much the same way as many people in present-day capitalist nations.  It is when Siddhartha begins to feel owned by his possessions and paradoxically empty in the fullness of his successes that he desperately seeks answers.<br /><br />Although the novel is more telling than showing, readers should realize that its purpose is not so much in the plot as in its cautionary theme.  The ending, where Siddhartha's friend sees all life reflected in the protagonist's face, hammers home Hesse's appreciation of basic Buddhist concepts about life.  For the curious about and the adherents of Buddhism, it is a pleasing morality tale that may be predictable but is no less worth the journey.<br /><br />SIDDHARTHA is one of those books that serious readers should have under their belt at some point during their lifetimes, no matter where they are on their own personal spiritual journeys...
B000G0O5N2|5.0|im sure most of us already know the movie but what comes as a pleasant surprise is the sharpness afforded by the HD transfer. every pore on the face and every bead of sweat jumps right out at you! in fact, anything with texture - war ravaged walls and rocks are all brilliant crisp and tactile. the bonus is the behind-the-scenes making of documentary (pretty long) which is very comprehensive and could be a video on its own. highly recommended.
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|We purchased the DVD & CD (for in playing in the car) and have been impressed with both, easy to listen and watch. The setting for the DVD is great and a place that we as two New Zealanders with Irish ancestry want to visit. The blend of Celtic, English and Operatic music is magic.
037542217X|5.0|Another polished gem where the No1 Ladies Detective Agency unknot the thorny problems of life over cups of bush tea. Precious has her sturdy feet firmly on the ground and her very traditional build projects the air of confidence that is so soothing to the callers passing through their door. The interplay between the two women is always a joy and deftly done. Precious is keen to see that her assistant should find true happiness in her life. Much the same as she has, but then she isn't hampered by a difficult complexion and very large glasses. Not to mention a prickly personality, although her assistant is a very good person with a good heart.<br />Meanwhile her assistant often yearns for just a little more glamour and excitement in her life, she knows she is not one of the pretty girls who get easy lives and rich husbands. Not only that, she is always in need of extra money even though her boss pays her as well as she can, so to make up the shortfall she sets up the Kalahari Typing School For Men. Reasoning quite rightly that men don't want to be shamed by having the ladies outshine them. The classes prove a great success and before too long teacher finds she is being wooed by one of her pupils. But sadly he isn't quite what he seems to be. There are others masquerading as something else and they must also be unmasked. But our ladies are up to the tasks, Precious never loses sight of what is important and knows just when to step in and when to hang back.<br />Problems are solved, hearts eased and things are put back to rights without too much harm done. So life trundles on and Precious carries on pottering about in a tiny white van that one day must surely die. Just not yet.<br />Once you get to know these books am sure you will also love to read and re-read them as it is like sharing a cup of tea with a dear friend. More to the point it is tea with a friend full of good advice and accumulated wisdom.

1400064287|5.0|A very useful resource for a wide range of audiences but I see particular relevance to professional communicators.  The guidelines to producing the six key qualities to make an idea stick are a perfect checklist for communication campaigns.  An excellent read
B000002O1Q|4.0|Not enough appreciated by the public, still one hot action movie of the '80s.
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|She would rather be smart than famous and in this movie she was willing to show off the shape of her skull for her cause.  This movie was a nice change from the Wachowski brothers, especially after the second and third matrix movies.  It has the same hate for the man while not being a pleaser for the fans and is done right.  This movie will suck you in and wow you with big explosions but is more of an entertainment film then a serious think piece.  For a real time of thinking about such themes one would be better met with a reading 1984.
B000002IZM|5.0|A remarkable example of a soundtrack that fits like a glove to the movie it accompanies!!!!!!
B000GFLKF8|4.0|This kind of movie prompts you to take wild guesses, but what is fun is the process and class of the movie.  While the kid in the theater next to me figured it out from the start, while having some small mistakes, there was nothing lost in seeing how it all went down and the slight surprise at the end.  Inside man is a feel good example of an old and dying art of the con man movie.  Technology is getting far too perfect for these kind of brilliant man versus the system type movie.  With the need of hacking eye scanners, finger print machines, motion sensors, time locked safes, security systems with off-shore staff that is awake twenty four hours a day, and even more things we can't even imagine but someone else did coming into play you need to be a billionaire to be a thief in the first place.  So these movies will become more and more rare, so we should enjoy them while we can.
0593055063|1.0|I made my bones by reading all of Brown's novels: da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons, Deception Point, and Digital Fortress, so listen up: <br /> <br />1. Awkward phrasing? Check. <br />2. Cardboard characters copied from previous DB book? Check. <br />3. Totally bogus technology or theology? Check. <br />4. Implausible motivations? Check. <br /> <br />I actually enjoyed da Vinci Code, at least the first time through, but Brown's novels get progressively worse.  I donated my copies of A&D and DP to my gym's library, but with Digital Fortress I did something I've only done once before: I burned it. <br /> <br />In Mark Twain's essay \\"The Literary Crimes of James Fenimore Cooper\\" he lists the 19 (some say 21) rules of composition, and states that Cooper achieved a record 15 violations in the space of 2/3 of a page.  Brown beats that record every time. <br /> <br />Try \\"Eye of the Needle\\" or \\"Day of the Jackal\\" if you want a good page-turner thriller. Remember, the hours spent with Brown's junk are gone forever, never to return...
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|Originally made with a high school cast and written by a high schooler himself Brick is re-casted with B actors who act well above the roles they've been given to this point.  A true throw back to noir while making the change of adding color and pulling it off Brick is an excellent movie all around.  The lead actor, Gordon-Levitt, is really working to establish himself despite hardly seeming to age since Ten Things I Hate About You.  In the end you will  feel good about the adventure of the movie, despite its hard and dark edge.  A definite movie to see sometime in your life.

B000MXPE74|2.0|Oh that never works. Flathead is a fine song that holds up beyond the 30 second soundbite. The rest of the CD just doesn't go anywhere and is fairly repetitive. Flathead is also the most orginal song on the CD- lyrically and musically. The Fratellas sound like a good local bar band no more no less
0440237688|5.0|Everyone fantasizes about living in a perfect world.  The Giver takes that idea and makes it seem real.  The characters find that a perfect world may have its drawbacks.

I have enjoyed teaching this book as much as my students enjoyed reading it.

B0008ENIAC|4.0|Joan morphs into Mildred and the magic of success overcomes both as this film was the one that established Ms. Crawford as \\"the real thing\\" when she portrays a woman driven by the effects of a difficult childhood into a greedy manipulative woman who due to instinctive insecutity finds achieving happiness a constant challenge.  It may have been the first of a long series of films that portrays the dysfunctional family(s) as concieved by Hollywood in a way that kept the cash flow creating wealth for the studios and their assorted benefactors.
B000687M48|3.0|Where to begin?---Let's see;the positive first:the videos are worth the price of the album. Evanescence is a great video band utilizing first rate directors and story ideas to match:very goth imagery.The live audio is okay if you are a big fan-although it appears Amy has studied the Rock and Roll cliche' handbook-by the numbers,banal and her between song banter appears scripted--they are a very young band hopefully with improvement room.The concert video is almost unwatchable with its cut back and forth editing--any aspiring directers take note on what not to do!! The backstage footage is okay but cliched as well.

B000HEWEE4|4.0|Most of the questions that came to me during a recent screening of THE LAKE HOUSE had nothing to do with the \\"time travel\\" aspect of the movie which I knew going in would be over my head.  But like everyone else, I respond viscerally to any movie that pairs Keanu Reeves with Sandra Bullock.  The two of them should star in all movies, in any year--2004, 2006, or now.  Think of how many films would have been much improved if only Reeves and Bullock had been available to take the title parts.  I'm thinking of MULHOLLAND DR, MILLION DOLLAR BABY, THE ICE AGE, even something like BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN could have used Sandra Bullock playing the part Anne Hathaway did and tempting Keanu Reeves with her knowledge of rodeo driving.<br /><br />But my questions were more about, what is with the strange brother of Keanu Reeves, Henry, and his leonine hairline which looks as though hair grows out of his head backwards and gets crimped there?  Where did they find this actor, or the woman who plays Sandra's mother?  For her part, the producers might have been turned down by Marsha Mason so they decided to get the \\"foreign\\" Marsha Mason, with her odd Dutch or Malaysian accent but all of Marsha Mason's botox plumping out her face like a pin cushion.<br /><br />(SPOILERS AHEAD.)<br /><br />It made me uncomfortable all the time she was around, even discounting the fact that I believe the mother (played by Willeke van Ammelrooy) made that bus run over Keanu Reeves as she sat with her daughter at Dealey Plaza and realized, when she lifted her gaze and saw Alex Wyler begin to approach, that this was the man who would once and for all take Sandra away from her at last.  Did anyone else get this, or am I just reading into things?  Notice that once Keane and Sandra get together, you never see the mother again.<br /><br />(END OF SPOILERS.)<br /><br />I believe that the movie calls out for a sequel in which Keanu's character, Alex Wyler, and his architect brother, Henry (played by Ebon Moss-Bachrach) would use their newfound time travel powers to go back and save the life of their mother, the woman who broke Christopher Plummer's heart and who condemned her two boys to live lives of meaningless hedonism and avant-garde architecture.  As for the misery Sandra Bullock's character causes Dylan Walsh from NIP/TUCK, if I were Dylan Walsh I would try to get another agent after making a fool out of me in THE LAKE HOUSE, period.on Moss-Bachrach) would use their newfound time travel powers to go back and save the life of their mother, the woman who broke Christopher Plummer's heart and who condemned her two boys to live lives of meaningless hedonism and avant-garde architecture.

B000EGDC0A|4.0|I heard some of the music on the TV show The L Word, and had never heard of this group before.  I decided it was time to add them to my every growing collection of CD's.  The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is one depressing song that almost puts me to sleep.  I prefer a more upbeat collection.  Good all around music.
0743454537|5.0|I loved this book.  I was hooked right away, and stayed up much too late several nights saying, \\"just one more chapter\\".  The topic was so thought provoking.  AS a parent I can't even imagine having to make the same choices for my children.  I guess the ending was a little manipulative, not my favorite part of the book, but I still think it was one of the best reads of recent memory.
B000EGCITG|5.0|I love this CD!  I have been listening to it in my car for weeks now, and it is in my head all day long!  Such variety from the political Dear Mr President, to the Sassy Hot Pink we all know and love.  I had no idea it would be this great when I purchased it, and I am more than pleased.
B000MGUZM0|3.0|The bottom line is: this is no Funeral, not even close. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad album, it just doesn't stack up against Funeral. Admittedly, Funeral was ingenious and any follow-up short of perfect would not compare well with it, yet Neon Bible left me unsatisfied. The sound seems too polished, and this detracts from the strength and emotion of the songs. The album is much darker than expected, however doesn't contain the same edge that Funeral had.
1582701709|3.0|I do not believe in the metaphysical, however, that being said I see benefit from the thesis of the book (Sorry, I haven't seen the movie) and try to live my life by its message. Even the Bible says \\"As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he\\".<br /><br />After a bout with cancer, my life has drastically changed for the better. I have gotten my BS in CIS, I am now signed up for Graduate school for my MS in Computer Science. I have made $50,000 more money now than 4 years ago. I am not saying this to boast in any way, but to say I truly believe in Carpe Diem. There is an old Taoist saying which says, \\"Nothing is more important than this day\\".<br /><br />Live life to the fullest by challenging yourself intellectually and physically. When I was going through chemo, I was so weak i had trouble walking. But I focused on what I could do. (Like stretching). Now that I am cancer free (Not by positive thinking but by the efforts of the Lymphoma and Leukemia Society, which BTW is a great cause), I now run 2-3 miles a day, lift weights 6 days a week, and am challenged in my career as a Senior Software Engineer and look forward to my upcoming classes in grad school.<br /><br />Life is good, believe in yourself. My simple rule in life is to be a good man, encourage myself to excellence, and be a positive influence to others
B000NVIXDW|4.0|Michael Buble is an INCREDIBLE singer.  He has the pipes of a legend and he is still quite young.  I am a performer myself, and I noticed that he has a bit of a funny lisp going on with his \\"TS\\" consonants.  I wonder if that was a stylistic choice, or if he does in fact have a speech impediment.  If anyone knows, please post back.  Overall, the CD is EXCELLENT, and the single Everything is one of the most romantic and catchy tunes out there now.   <br /> <br />KEEP RECORDING MICHAEL!
075640407X|5.0|I was very pleased with new author Patrick Rothfuss's intriguing epic about the early years of a hero.  The protagonist Kvothe was well-rendered, and there is enough action, magic, romance and surprise for any fan of quality fantasy.  This book is not as dark as many of my favorites (such as the masterpieces of George Matrin, R. Scott Bakker, or Steven Erikson), but readers of those works should like this novel as well. There are certainly glimpses that this series has the potential to one day be thought of as a classic if future books are as well-written.

B000001FI7|4.0|portishead rocks!<br /><br />but the funny thing about this cd, with its echoing bass and drum lines, and the ghostly echoing lead vocals is that i love each song so much, i can't distinguish one from the other.<br /><br />this is not to say there is a sameness in the music.  each track has its own character.  but i swear, i don't remember a single name as i write this.

B000008JUM|4.0|this is the red hot that started the whole affair.  this collection of cole porter covers was recorded as a way to let the world know that the music industry cared about aids awareness and raising money to bring about a cure.<br /><br />the representation of artists is a cross section of who was hot in 1990 with few exceptions (prince, janet jackson, madonna and cyndi lauper immediately comes to mind--madonna would pay her dues soon though).  some of them are gloriously up to doing the cole porter songs justice.<br /><br />for example, lisa stansfield's 'down in the depths' is elegantly jazzy and a perfect showcase for her sweet honeyed mezzo.  and, kd lang can do wrong working her way through 'so in love'.  it's brilliant.  as is annie lennox's 'ev'ry time we say goodbye'.<br /><br />others bring their stamp to the songs and make it happen for the pop market.  u2's 'night and day' is a great success, david byrne takes 'don't fence me in' on a great romp and fine young cannibals take 'love for sale', which has an unshakeable identity with women from billie holiday to aretha franklin, and makes it a randy boy-toy cruise that porter would have loved!<br /><br />now, while sinead o'connor and iggy pop made be the last two singers one would expect to take on cole porter, o'connor's whispery boop-a-doop approach to 'you do something to me' is a definite change of pace and pop just says 'so what!?' he and debbie harry give 'well, did you evah?' the punked out once over that again would have tickled porter to no end.<br /><br />now, if he wouldn't lose his sense of humor on some of the rest, as a listener i do.  jody watley has one of the toughest tunes to do in 'after you--who?'.  and a sense of humor or a little help from elton john might have saved her.  as is her apporach is too studied and careful.  and i don't get salif keita's 'begin the beguine'.  this is one of the songs that needed to be sung because of its lusicious melody.  and i like rap as much as the next person but i have to concede the point that porter's lyrics don't need reconception as raps.he next person but i have to concede the point that porter's lyrics don't need reconception as raps.

B000002549|4.0|to record this set of songs was a huge risk for barbra streisand to take.  but what other singer would put themselves on the line like this and record a whole album of classical material except barbra streisand?<br /><br />dusty springfield had a song or two that borrowed melodies from the classical music genre, and aretha franklin famously growled her way through 'nessun dorma' at the grammys back in 1999.  but this is very different and bold.<br /><br />and no one, not even those with the vocals chops and training like linda ronstadt wouldn't take this one on for size.<br /><br />it is easy to hear that streisand has put all her stylistic trademarks on hold and performed her recital with integrity.  and at times, a different streisand emerges and it's quite nice.  it's only a phrase here and a note there but it's interesting to hear.<br /><br />be warned--she still sounds like barbra streisand.  and there's one song i personally wish she hadn't sang (the canteloube), only because there's another song in that canon that might have served her even better called 'la dellaisado'.

1565117700|5.0|It's undisputed that Steinbeck's novel is a gem of its own rights. Add to that Gary Sinise, a great actor who very obviously has a soft spot for this particular book (Gary Sinise has done Of Mice And Men on stage as well as for the movies) and it's magic that is created.  <br /> <br />One man's voice turns from narrating to snarky to hatefilled to sad with a burden too heavy to carry in the span of moments. It's a brilliant interpretation Gary Sinise is delivering. I couldn't stop listening and was carried to a place where sycamore leaves were rustling under my feet. Amazing!
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Taste in music is such a personal matter and evidence of that is certainly on display in the varied opinions here.  Some people like lots of fast songs.  Some like the ballads, some like originals, some like covers, some like the vocals more polished and some like them a little rough around the edges.  As for my taste, I enjoyed all of Buble's work up to this point but wasn't convinced of his greatness...Until now.  The song selection is superb and no two songs sound alike while many styles are represented.  And yet, mysteriously, there is cohesiveness to the selections that pull it all together.  Perhaps the strength of Buble's personality that shines through in each song is the binding that creates the whole.  Yet on the whole, this CD lacks the polish of his previous CD's. But there lies much of it's charm.  Buble sang these tracks live without overdubs and multi tracking and as a result, his soul, imperfections and all, is allowed to come through.  This is a lot of the appeal for me.  Buble is the real deal and if this release is any indication, as good as it is, the best really is yet to come.

B000O75F7C|5.0|I recently read someone describe this release as a chronicle of Porcupine Tree's sound and I couldn't agree more. They've continued an evolution while allowing listeners to reflect on where they've come thus far. Fear of a Blank Planet also brings back the concept of the \\"concept album\\" first created by legendary rock greats when rock music was alive and in your face. Porcupine Tree are oriented with guitars but can also induce listeners with entrancing grooves. They're modern yet classic, original yet influenced, and they know how to borrow from the best by bringing aboard guest musicians like Alex Lifeson to help anesthetize fans on \\"Anesthetize,\\" and Robert Fripp to add some effects on \\"Way Out of Here.\\" Plus the way they bring in the old guitar riff from \\"Trains\\" on the song \\"Sentimental\\" feels like an unexpected moment of pure genius in the studio.

B000HBK3MM|4.0|I'm new to Corrine Bailey Rae.  I have enjoyed this CD.  She has a voice and style similar to Norah Jones.
0618680004|4.0|This is a well-written, convincing book. Nevertheless one must keep in mind that this is a work of rhetoric, and it has all the weaknesses that good rhetoric has. Thus it highlights the ongoing search of atheists for a philosophically legitimate, but still convincing, way of getting their point across.<br /><br />As rhetoric, this book's real purpose is not to prove but to convince. A predictable centerpiece of the book is the argument that the evils perpetrated *in the name of* religion prove the evil *of* religion. Pretty standard stuff that goes down well with sympathetic readers, and skillfully wielded here. But Dawkins is a biologist, and \\"correlation equals causation\\" illogic is something the Scientific Method would never stand for. Indeed, Dawkins fails to convince us that a world without religion would be a world without religion's evils. The lengths to which Dawkins goes to excoriate religion rather suggest that an atheist world might rival a sectarian one in the capacity for hatred, if not for violence and exploitation.<br /><br />Like all good rhetoric, this book targets the reader's emotions. That is both its strength and its weakness. Dawkins argues for logic and reason, but rarely employs logic or reason in doing so. By trying to undermine religion using its own methods, Dawkins unwittingly confirms the supremacy of man's inherent emotionalism over his capacity for (or perhaps his willingness to) reason.<br /><br />It is no mistake that the works of anti-religion rhetoric are written by highly educated men who are trained to think logically and rationally about the world. But when even these men resort appeals to anger to convince, their arguments seem self-defeating.

B000FVQM2Y|5.0|Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars in \\"Brick\\" as Brendan, a high school student searching for his ex-girlfriend, Emily.  After they broke up, Emily started \\"eating lunch\\" with a more popular, yet mysterious crowd (\\"The Upper-Crust\\").  As he delves into their world, he finds a sickening subculture of drugs, double-crosses, and worse.<br /><br />The movie is set in Orange County (San Clemente), and the movie's big hook is that it's an update of those terrific film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s.  Yes, the movie sometimes comes across as \\"The O.C.\\" mixed with \\"The Lady from Shanghai,\\" with just a touch of \\"Blue Velvet.\\"  However, as such, \\"Brick\\" succeeds very well.  The dialogue is full of clever pithy lines and slang that went out with Eisenhower (Beautiful woman: Do you trust me now?  Brendan: Less than when I didn't trust you before.).  The directing is also terrific - kudos to first time director Rian Johnson.  Finally, Jospeh Gordon-Levitt makes a likeable protagonist amidst the crazy proceedings and characters, including a rather magnetic Lukas Haas as \\"The Pin.\\"<br /><br />Although making the film in noir style is essentially a stunt, the tone helps make the movie deeper, more satisfying - easily one of the most intricate teen dramas ever made.  The plot is full of holes (what film noir isn't?), but the noir style and look smoothes out the rough edges; yes, style does sometimes trump content.  There were a few times when the \\"Brick\\" verged on being a typical teen movie; fortunately, Johnson manages to get back on track.  Highly recommended for fans of film noir or sophisticated teen dramas.
B000I5X81K|5.0|I have loved all of Josh Groban's CD's but I have to say this is one of my most favorites. He shows more diversity with his song choice and more control than ever in using his beautiful vocal instrument. It has very moving ballads such as  \\" So She Dances\\" that can bring a tear to your eye, along with his music he shares with the Afrikan Boys choir. Very Charming. The man is definitely growing more each time with his musical prowess. Buy this Cd...you'll be pleased forever!

B000O75F7C|5.0|steven wilson is simply a genius. He cant help it, he just is. The cd is amazing, a must have, buy it now...
B000MRA5NS|4.0|very good movie with excellent image quality. one of the better blu-rays so far. best James Bond movie in many years. i had my doubts too, but i really believe you will like this James Bond!
B000BM6AVA|5.0|This cd is excellent.  Every song on it is a winner.  I love it.
B000LC55F2|3.0|good movie, not great. probably worth the price of dvd, but not an hd disc. it was an entertaining movie, however, with a few surprises throughout. michael caine was good, as usual.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|Fantastic.  Wonderful.  Excellent.  I expect to see every song on this cd as a `number one'. <br /> <br />Listening to Black Parade makes me happy.
B000002KAT|5.0|This album doesn't suck. <br /> <br />Buy it.  Put it on.  Shut up.  Listen to it.  Don't be afraid to lose yourself (you'll find yourself again).  <br /> <br />I'm going to put it on right now. <br />
B0000E6XH3|5.0|I had seen the first four videos of this collection before, and i was anxious to see the entire story unfold to the music of Daft Punk.  When i popped this in i was so impressed by the music and visual representation that i watched it twice in a row.  This isnt too long or too short of a movie, about an hour long, a little less, and its mostly kid friendly if you want to watch it with kids. get it before they stop making it!
B000KC86F4|4.0|Great contrast and colors, not the sharpest blu-ray, but one of the best.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|You simply cannot watch this movie and not fall in love with it.  A true ensemble piece, the inter-weaving of the various story lines is worthy of several viewings.  You will notice different things each time you see it and these discoveries add to the fun.<br /><br />A loose affiliation links several people: the newly elected prime minister of England (Hugh Grant), his sister (Emma Thompson), her husband, a magazine editor in chief (Alan Rickman), her friend (Liam Neeson), his step-son (Thomas Sangster - so adoreable!), an editor at the magazine (Laura Linney in another amazing performance), a photographer at the magazine (the dreamy Rodrigo Santoro), a writer (Colin Firth) all sort of tied together by a disappated rock star played with tongue firmly in cheek by Bill Nighy.  There are several others, which is another reason why more than one viewing helps.  All of them have their story to share and each unfolds in bits and pieces.  It all leaves you warm and fuzzy and completely happy at the end.
B00005JLEU|5.0|As with all Miyazaki movies, it is great. Fun to watch with the kids. Beautiful graphics. And just a hint of oriental strangeness.
0920236162|4.0|My kids thought this book was rather silly, but they liked it, so...
B000803PP4|3.0|Nothing special about it. Save your money and buy the original one for much cheaper.
0894803123|5.0|Only thing that would make this book better is if they created an ice cream that would conform with the Adkins diet.  Ice creams come out rich and great tasting.

0060888695|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird was a reading assignement for my grandson's 9th grade English class.  We listened to the audio book together then were able to discuss the story together.  It was such an enjoyable way to experience this wonderful book.

B000MG1ZGA|5.0|Just a quick question, I own the Perception Box Set, is there any difference between these discs and those in that set?
B000O178BY|1.0|This is certainly a disputable album; in fact, it is a huge disappointment.  After reading some of the reviews already on Amazon, I am not unconvinced that Reznor himself (or any friends) wrote them given how unrealistic they are.  Is this the current state of music as it stands?  Have we lost that much aesthetic judgment, tact, and taste since the 1990s?  Are we that far gone?<br /><br />The Fragile was a fantastic album, and I have enjoyed Reznor since Pretty Hate Machine.  I can remember the caustic tone of voice throughout much of the Downward Spiral.  And I certainly appreciated the skillful composition of Fixed, though it was certainly no comparison to its predecessor, Broken.  I even thoroughly enjoyed Further Down the Spiral, especially if you were fortunate enough to grab the copy with Ruiner V.2 on it.<br /><br />Where does this leave Year Zero?  Year Zero belongs in Year Zero, a non-existent state.  This album should have never been made.  I was becoming more frustrated with Reznor as he began to become more political, but he has now finally reached the pinnacle of politicization and for that, he is forever lost.  This certainly does not mean that artists cannot inject their political views and attempt to infect those who listen.  Certainly not.  But when one becomes too seduced by the Siren of politics, one forgets about art, and this is where the problem lies.  It seems that Trent is now catering his politics to the same swine that he attacked with such vitriol in his earlier albums.<br /><br />After buying this album, I immediately started to listen to it.  Every Song is Exactly the Same.  I was willing to give this album away to a close friend who has been a connoisseur of good rock and a veteran of NIN, yet, he had already purchased the album.  Unfortunately, he corroborated my opinion and I realized I was not alone.  Reznor had mentioned some years back that he wanted to do Pop music, but it was going to be a different kind.  He terrified me when he uttered such words, but I thought perhaps he changed his mind.  It looks like this is exactly what he meant.<br /><br />Admittedly, this album does not deserve one star, perhaps 2, but certainly no more than 3.  I have only chosen 1 out of the disgust of so many people who felt it deserves 5.  Any traditional NIN fans should boycott this album and perhaps encourage Trent to go back to the dreadlocks of Head Like a Hole in hopes that it might inspire him into something more artistic yet again.  If you do buy this album, be wary that it may collect dust, but it does make an excellent centerpiece and even acts as a nice coaster.<br /><br />Please Trent, don't bother making another album if you are going to put out more garbage like this.  You are beginning to parallel those rap /pop artists who, after they make their first hit, they release kindergarten fingerpaint because they know that their name will now sell.<br /><br />If this reflects the current state of affairs as far as music is concerned, then we have much more to worry about than Trent's pathetic attempt at prognostication and storymaking.when he uttered such words, but I thought perhaps he changed his mind.

B000ILYYJE|5.0|OK, now I purchased the Perception Box set several months ago. However, my discs are not the 40th anniversary mixes. They are, however, unbelievably remastered just as perfectly and everything exactly the same and clear as the 40th anniversary mixes, however, not a single track on any of the disks is the 40th anniversary version. They are just as remastered and perfect sounding as those on the 40th anniversary discs, however, they contain none of the extra musical or vocal parts in them as the 40th ones do. Were there two releases or do I have a set equivalent to having a book or coin that was printed upside down (if you understand what I mean). If someone can help me out here, that'd be great.
0618680004|2.0|I must confess to picking up this book in some trepidation.  I am both a Ph.D. scientist as well as a Christian who has thought deeply and long about my faith, in the process reading books like this. The glowing reviews left me fearful that this book would leave me in a painful period of doubt and questioning.  Unfortunately, it seems that I didn't have to worry because I've found the book underwhelming and not all that challenging.  Unfortunately, I can only cover the most obvious things here.    First off, it is clear from the outset that Dr. Dawkins did not set forth to write a fair or balanced discussion of the belief in God.  In many cases the language used either shows a complete lack of understanding how others will react or else is purposely combative and insulting.  This immediately makes his views and reasoning suspect, which has been borne out by other reviewers who've showed how some quotes have been taken out of context.  I also find it interesting how Dr. Dawkins begins by quoting so much from Einstein, all except for Einstein's statement that, \\"There are people who say there is no God.  But what makes me really angry is that they quote me for support of such views.\\"  (Excerpt from Walter Isaacson's \\"Einstein\\" as published in Time Magazine, April 16, 2007).  I'm not saying that he inaccurately describes Einstein's beliefs, but leaving out that quote makes one wonder how others who were quoted would have felt about it.  As for his appeal to religion as being due to wishful thinking, he should be careful; that knife cuts both ways.  An atheist has his or her own reasons for hoping there isn't a God.  A careful reading will show some of Dawkin's.    Dr. Dawkins also incorrectly applies the anthropic principle, at least as far as I understand it.  The anthropic principle states that whatever the probability that intelligent life would develop capable that probability must be such that it would occur once because otherwise we wouldn't be here pondering thequestion.  If this is a correct understanding then the anthropic principle does not apply to the question of whether life is the result of God's action or rather to chance and natural selection.  The anthropic principle only applies if you assume that there was no active cause and therefore random chance is the only option.    Dr. Dawkins also attacks the NOMA proposition, i.e. that science and religion don't overlap because they don't deal with the same questions.  His argument is that miracles certainly fall under the magisterium of science because they are events that happen in the physical world.  However, what Dr. Dawkins fails to do is tell us what would have to happen in order for him to believe that he'd actually seen a miracle.  If one believes, as Dawkins seems to, that science does not allow for supernatural causes, then isn't he much more likely to think, \\"Well, that was something I don't understand, but I'm sure there's a perfectly natural explanation and I'm sure we'll understand it someday.\\"?  If science rules out supernatural causes by definition, and I agree that it does, then how can science ever be used to prove a miracle?           This same inability to step out of his paradigm, that paradigm being that there is nothing outside this universe and no options other than chance variation and natural selection, is what also makes his ultimate 747 argument unconvincing to anyone who does not share his initial beliefs as expressed in that paradigm.  And I've chosen the word \\"beliefs\\" on purpose because that's what they are. What Dr. Dawkins doesn't seem to understand is that if you don't subscribe to those beliefs, and Christians don't, then his argument is unconvincing and underwhelming.  To us, God is not in this box we call a universe.  All the mystics from all religions agree that God is not a thing or a being like anything we have even imagined.  That's not a cop out, it's simply a fact.  God doesn't \\"come from\\" anywhere, God has always existed without beginning or end.  Dawkins accuses intelligent design proponents for lacking imagination when they cite \\"irreducible complexity\\", but Dawkins also lacks in imagination; he seems unable to envision anything different from this universe.    Dawkins proposes that the 90% (or thereabouts) of people who believe in some kind of supernatural \\"God\\" are deluded.  But I would like to propose another hypothesis based on known science for the 10% who don't believe.  Many people who believe in God believe because they say they've experienced God somehow.  I'm not talking about miracles.  I'm talking about feeling a \\"presence\\" which has made a marked change in their lives.  We know that spirituality has a genetic component.  In a manner of speaking the ability to experience or sense God varies between people.  We know that this variation occurs with all our sense abilities.  Some people are color blind and so can't distinguish red and green.  Others can't taste certain tastes, like bitter.  I hypothesize that perhaps people like Dr. Dawkins are among that unfortunate minority of people who lack or have a very weak ability to sense God.  Unfortunately, this leads them to assert that God doesn't exist rather than considering that maybe the majority is able to \\"see\\" something that they cannot.
0440241030|4.0|Reacher is my favorite character in print.  This wasn't the best book of the series, but is still tough to put down and kept me guessing.  I can't get enough Reacher and can't wait to read the next one.
B0007XH5OY|4.0|A wonderful album from start to finish , jeff beck is a master and proves this is one of his earliest studio recordings but , although the guitar work is the buzz of this album let's not forget the greatest voice in blues and rock yes , himself , minster rod stewart! Stewarts vocals give this album it's magic touch , if your not firmiliar with rod stewarts early career check out his work with the faces and his early albums especially the period of 1972 - 1978 . <br /> returning to Mr beck , his fingers move across the fret board as if speaking a musical language there are moments of sheer beauty through to angry young man . <br /> My only critic is the bonus tracks , apart from the best song on the album ¨I've been drinking¨ the rest are basically old edits of the songs you've already got on the album interesting but.......!by the way hi hi silver lining , must they really!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A great series, to bad it was cut short. I would love to see this one brought back.
B000FDECGA|5.0|In the 19th century in Japan, a lone ronin warrior named LoneWolf and his son travel across the countryside to fight off deadly ninja assassins so he can avenge the death of his beloved wife. A powerful shogun sends out minions to kill Lonewolf but can the one-man army deal with all of them himself?<br /><br />One of the most violent and goriest movies of all time! This Japanese-American production is actually three films from the Japanese series \\"LoneWolf and Cub\\" into one movie and dubbed into English. A definite favorite of Quentin Tarantino as he used this movie as an inspiration to his \\"Kill Bill\\" movies, it's an entertaining and gory-as-hell is a visual action feast with some laughable English dubbing but the action is non-stop with heads being split open, slicing and dicing etc. I can see why this has got a cult following, you gotta see it to believe it.<br /><br />This DVD has excellent picture and sound with the movie shown in it's widescreen presentation for the first time in the U.S.! the extras are decent like the theatrical trailer, restoration gallery, program notes and  Daigo's history lesson.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"Ninja Scroll\\", \\"The Toxic Avenger\\", \\"Kill Bill Vols 1 & 2\\", \\"Fist of the North Star (Anime)\\", \\"Battle Royale\\", \\"Versus\\", \\"The Last Samurai\\", \\"Seven Samurai\\", \\"Ran\\", \\"Princess Mononoke\\", \\"Big Trouble in Little China\\", \\"Running Scared\\", \\"Cannibal Ferox\\", \\"Sin City\\", \\"300\\", \\"Braveheart\\", \\"The Patriot (2000)\\", \\"Street Trash\\", \\"Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky\\", \\"Ichi The Killer\\", \\"Conan The Barbarian\\", \\"Hot Fuzz\\", \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\", \\"Bad Boys 2\\", \\"Vampire Hunter D\\", \\"Commando\\", \\"The Punisher (1989 and 2004)\\", \\"Rashomon\\", \\"Crank\\", \\"Samurai Fiction\\" and \\"Troma's War\\".
1594837937|5.0|This book was wonderful.  It showed how a romance could be changed by one of the members enlisting in the military to support his country. It tells of people growing up and growing apart.  How they react to each other and the selfless love they develop is worked up wonderfully.
B000MV9026|3.0|I watched this movie for the first time with my 5 year old daughter.<br /><br />She had seen it in the theater and loved it.  So, I bought it for her when it was released on DVD.  It might have been targeted at a younger audience but I was expecting something similar to Cars, or Shrek.  I was disappointed.  If you want a movie to play for the lids great.  But for me I will watch Cars again and leave Happy Feet in the drawer.
B00001U0DP|5.0|This is a beautiful story about what a man will do to protect his family in the time of crisis.
1569242739|5.0|The pictures of recipies in this book are beautiful.  I bought this as a gift for my cupcake makin' mother-in-law (so she can make cupcakes for me, of course).   She made the pineapple cupcakes - they turned out great, and looked just like the picture.  If you like cupcakes, or might like cupcakes, or just like looking at pictures of cupcakes, this is the book for you.
B000N3T0DW|5.0|This is a must see movie for women of all ages, and for men who don't understand women at all.  This movie proves the bonds that women have are forever, even though there are sometimes boulders in the road.  Family and woman sisterhood are the same.  Great see it, you'll learn some Spanish culture also.
0743496728|5.0|Although the ending was to some extent predictable, Jodi Picoult has written this novel as only she could.  Not exactly what I would call a \\"fun\\" read, but one that is hard-hitting, and from the very beginning - difficult to put down.<br /><br />We have all learned that a school shooting can happen anywhere with little or no warning.  Jodi Picoult has shown us how it could happen with characters who are people we know, and heart wrenching and stomach turning details, that are totally believable.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|This version of the movie has deleted scenes that truly make it a different film.  The whole story of Sybilla's son was taken out of the final version.  Although long, its quite good
B000LXH0AE|5.0|If you consider yourself a big Will Ferrell fan, you might actually want to skip this movie. It is almost nothing like his usual style. Instead of playing a ridiculous buffoon through a series of cheap jokes, Ferrell is part of an intelligent, emotionally engaging film this time.    Harold Crick is an obsessively neat loner who works as an auditor for the IRS. Crick is very good at his job, which is a good thing, because that's nearly all he does. He has no social life and almost no outside interests, besides his unvarying routine. (Brush each tooth 35 times up and down, 35 side to side. Count the steps on the way to the bus.)    All of this changes when Crick starts hearing a voice narrating his actions. The voice describes exactly what he's doing as he's doing it. This understandably throws Crick off balance, and his work, among other things is negatively affected. Losing his cool, professional stance, he finds himself very attracted to the owner of a bakery who happens to be one of his auditees. (Hearing a voice carefully describe sexual fantasies about a woman present while trying to keep his mind on other things would be difficult for any man.)    Already worried, Crick becomes downright panicked when the voice announces his imminent death. Attempting to understand this strange experience, he consults with a professor of literature. (Professor Jules Hilbert is played by Dustin Hoffman. Hilbert is very reminiscent of his role as the existential detective in I Heart Huckabees.)    Paralleling all of this is the dilemma of Karen Eiffel, an author desperately trying to find an ending for her new novel. Her biggest problem is how exactly she's going to kill off Harold Crick.    Crick finally discovers exactly who is narrating his life (and death) and meets up with Eiffel. I won't ruin the ending, but I'll just say it's satisfying, if not perfect.    The script for this movie is fantastic, repeatedly flowing in directions that evade the audience's expectations. The entire cast puts in excellent performances. I, who am not a fan of Ferrell's usual style, was very pleasantly surprised by his genuine talent. Some people found the occasional CGI animations overlaid on the action distracting, but I thought they illustrated Crick's precise thought processes well. There are a few stray bits of plot that don't feel filled out very well, but nothing that detracts from the overall effect of this movie.    This is a great example of something we see far too rarely today: an intelligent, well-played comedy for grown-ups. If you're tired of watching Carrey, Stiller and Ferrell make fools of themselves in films like Zoolander or Dumb and Dumber, this is the perfect comedy for you.
B000M5AJQ8|5.0|I was interesting to see the different big names in this one - the movie had a twist for a gangster movie.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie.  It's in the same genre as The Royal Tennebaums but not as dark.  The not-so-subtle jab at the \\"Little Miss\\" Beauty contests skillfully illustrates up how bizarre that industry really is.  The characters were well developed and the ending was a winner!!
1581806574|5.0|This is a graet book, it will give you a step by step walkthrough about how to draw dragons, I found it very helpful, and easy to use. <br />It dos not just have dragons in it, there are other mythelogical beast like the chimera, the griffon, gorgyle ect. <br /> <br />But not just is it a drawing book, it is funny too, the artist have alot of humor in the book, something that actually made me read the damn thing (I don't normaly read drawing books). <br />The only bad thing about this book is that it ends.
B000002U94|5.0|I bought this on LP when it first came out and it immediately became my favorite live album.  So many live albums lose the balance between the music and the audience, where the music overpowers the crowd to the point where you lose the thrill of the event being \\"live.\\"  \\"Nine Tonight\\" carries the perfect balance here, as well as providing a nice collection of great rock songs, like \\"Against The Wind,\\" \\"Night Moves,\\" and \\"Rock And Roll Never Forgets.\\"  My only complaint about this CD is the need to shorten the final song, \\"Let It Rock,\\" to fit it onto one CD.  That song highlighted Seger's rapport with the audience, and the abridged version is not as good as the original.  Other than that, I highly recommend this CD to all Seger, and rock and roll, fans!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Absolutely fantastic collection of the best TV drama series ever produced.  So will written & directed.  The package is also outstanding.  Worth every cent.

B000NVIXFK|1.0|All I had to do was hear the samples to determine if this cd was garbage or not and sadly it is, I won't be purchasing or going to the trouble and expense of seeing Rush live this year, since Terry Brown's depature Rush has been hard to listen to, I'd give Carress of Steel more tribute than this effort, Vapor Trails was a noisy pile of trash that all of the long time fans felt obliged to endure and buy, Fly by Nite is still in my ears opinion the best recording of Rush to date, I am a fan since the mid 70's and have seen them live numerous times, Farewell to Kings was a fantastic tour and recording, the sound live was phenominal and not noisy at all, Vapor Trails was awful, hated the dryers onstage, Wheaton does not not know how make drums sound good either, Alex played noisy trash all nite, the \\"oldies medely\\" was completely soul-less, all of us long time Rush fans who made Rush into the monster success they are have been short changed for the past decade and that's being gracious, the meaty straight ahead Rock with the screeching vocals, cheesy cowbells, Zep/Cream inspired guitars, that's Rush, this new stuff is for the birds... come to think of it, they wouldn't like it much either, I'm still a Rush fan but I have to go back a long way to find the gems.
0345494768|5.0|Wow! What a great contribution for this year's anniversary celebration! After so much having been previously published and presented about the \\"making of\\" I was surprised at the detailed content and new revelations contained in this hefty volume. Not light reading.

B00070Q7VO|5.0|Michael Buble sings like the love child of Frank Sinatra, Harry Connick, Jr., Dean Martin, and maybe a little Perry Como and Andy Williams thrown in for good measure.  The guy is SMOOOOOOOOOOOTH.  Not only that, he has an unerring instinct for the unusual song arrangement.  How do you take \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" and turn it into an homage to both the Beatles and Benny Goodman-era swing?  Somehow, Buble manages to do it.  And in \\"Feeling Good,\\" the opening track on this CD, he injects a considerable amount of James Bondesque thematic stuff--check out the snazzy, brassy horn arrangements here.    <br /> <br />When he's paired with anyone, he's going to make them sound better than they might on their own.  I'm not a big Nelly Furtado fan, but on their duet on \\"Quando, Quando, Quando,\\" he makes her sound worth longing for--and she sounds simultaneously innocent (in her aching for him) and sultry--as though she's slinking across a piano wearing little more than Chanel No. 5 and a smile. <br /> <br />\\"Save the Last Dance For Me\\" becomes a salsa/samba/tango tune that is less about dancing and more about what happens at home after the dancing--and on \\"Home,\\" a tune Buble had a hand in writing, he addresses his own frenetic touring lifestyle and the importance of remembering who's waiting when the tour is done.  All in all, a stellar, outstanding effort by an adventurous and talented musician.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is a wonderful story. Pride and Prejudice is a classic that has inspired, interested and entertained young women for years, and henceforth has been made into many movies. Amazingly, each one has tried to represent the complete and prominent beauty of this story, but none has succeeded completely, because they are either too long, or too short. Until now. In the 2005 version, (w) starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen, one will be swept away in the world of Jane Austen and be kept tucked away in its arms. Being the re-representation of Pride and Prejudice the book, the  <br />movie keeps close to the original and only veers away to emphasize and enhance it, since modern people are harder to please. When one watches this video they will see a wonderful and picturesque world that will fly them away from reality and into a world of romance and \\"Happily Ever After.\\" Nothing beats this tale.  <br />  <br />All is quiet as Elizabeth Bennet walks through the fields in the early morning, book in hand. Unfortunately, that does not last. Even as she steps up onto the steps of her home, she hears the chattering of her sisters and the shrewish voice of her mother. \\"Mr. Bennet, have you not heard? Netherfield Park is let at last, do you not wish to know who has taken it?\\" \\"As you wish to tell me my dear, I doubt I have much choice in the matter.\\" He replied tiredly. Spotting her sisters, Elizabeth hurried towards them. \\"Lydia, Kitty, what have we said about listening at the door.\\" But they quickly hush her, and inform her that a young and rich man, (w) named Mr. Bingley was moving in just up the road. \\"He's single.\\" They gasped, and instantly Jane, the eldest sister was pulled into the conversation. \\"Who's single?\\" the conversation continued in the other room. \\"How could that possibly effect them?\\" their father rumbled. \\"Oh, Mr. Bennet, how can you be so tiresome, you know he must marry one of them.\\" Stifling giggles the four girls leaned in closer, since the conversation has just gotten interesting. Just then the door opened and Mr. Bennet himself stepped out, not at all surprised to see his daughters listening in. Then all of them pursue him through the house, because they are trying to convince him to visit the man. As they pass her, the girls pull Mary up from her piano stool and into the living room with them. \\"For your information,\\" Mr. Bennet said finally, cutting them off, \\"I already have.\\" \\"You have?\\" and again they began to bombard him with questions, this time about the man's character. \\"So will he come to the ball then Papa?\\" Lydia finally asks breathlessly and eagerly. \\"I believe so.\\" In an instant, temperaments go from concerned to overjoyed and preparations begin immediately for creating the best appearance to catch the eye of the young man.  Elizabeth just laughs and thinks about how fast a quiet morning can turn into one of such frivolity.  <br />  <br />The ball was such a mix of sounds that it was almost impossible to hear anything, even though Elizabeth was sitting right next to her sister Jane and her best friend Charlotte. \\"If all of the men in the room don't end the evening in love with you then I am no judge of beauty,\\" she told Jane, but she was only answered with a laugh and retort, \\"Or men.\\" \\"No, they are far too easy to judge.\\" The lady laughed, looking at the room full of middle society folk, all enjoying themselves immensely. \\"They're not all bad.\\" Jane reproved scanning the faces for Mr. Bingley. \\"Poppycocks in my limited experience.\\" \\"One of these days Lizzy, someone's going to catch your eye and then you're going to have to watch your tongue.\\" Charlotte agreed with a knowing look, because she knew her friend well. Not much later, the doors blew open revealing three people who looked both rich and self absorbed. Instantly, the room fell silent as the figures strode through the room, since they were imposing figures. \\"Which one of the painted peacocks is our Mr. Bingley?\\" Lizzy asked her friend. \\"He's on the left,\\" in secret she looked at the ginger haired young man and decided that he wasn't so bad. He was smiling at the crowd genially and nodding at different people. \\"And on the right is his sister.\\" Again her eyes scanned the woman and concluded that if any words could be used for her, they would be proud, attention seeking and prejudiced. \\"And the person with the quizzical brow?\\" she finally inquired. \\"That is his good friend Mr. Darcy.\\" \\"He looks miserable poor soul.\\" \\"Miserable he may be, but poor he most certainly is not.\\" Sweeping the crowd, his eyes found hers as she rose from her curtsy and he hastily turned his gaze back to the front. Finally, Sir William Lucus, Charlotte's father stepped forward and greeted them. Elizabeth believed he was proud. After that, chaos ensued at the party again with all its noise and clamor. <br />  <br />The family's simple plan of uniting Mr. Bingley to Jane for an advantageous marriage becomes more and more complex as Mr. Collins, the cousin who is to inherit everything that belongs to the girls, shows up with a determination to marry one of them. At around the same time Mr. Wickham steps into the scene and practically sweeps Elizabeth off her feet in one sentence, because he is witty and charming. But Mr. Darcy isn't done with her either, since she has already caught his eye. Suddenly the stubborn Elizabeth finds herself being twirled around in a spinning love-go-round. Being young, being stubborn and being love sick she is confused with the two stories spun for her, concerning the connection of Darcy and Wickham. Who is telling the truth? When faced with the choice, which man will she eventually marry? Will her sisters end up in poverty or will they have advantageous marriages too?   <br /> <br />In order to find out, in order to learn more, and in order to see the beauty for oneself, one must watch the movie or even read the very book. Pride and Prejudice is a complex story that will be a treasure for all young ladies adding to their collection. Not only is it entertaining, but it is a sweet and clean chick flick that stands above all the rest, which is saying a lot. The directors did a wonderful job of keeping it close enough to the book that anyone can read it afterwards and still not be disappointed, but still making it appealing to the teen crowd. Many young women can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it, because one can catch different things when it is watched more. It is a comfort movie. Being full of wonderful music, people can buy the soundtrack or even the piano book to keep the beauty in their home. Finally, many lessons can be learned from this story since people learn never to judge on appearances and to love one's family even through thick and thin. Since it is a terrific tale of truth Pride and Prejudice is a movie a family will want to watch again and again.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|This is a great movie with MANY quotes and lessons to take away from it.  The beginning is priceless when one of the main character (Kate Winslet) describes the different types of love.  Later, her description of how women over analyze everything and how it does us in in our relationships....this is what we all know...but it is necessary to hear over and over again so we can STOP DOING IT.  Overall, a cute, funny flick with a lot of great relationship pointers.  Now if only I could find my Jude Law.
B000H305U0|5.0|When I first bought this album, I thought, well there are a couple of great singles here (Sexyback!) but the album as a whole doesn't compare to his first ([[ASIN:B00006JO4Q Justified]]).  I'm a huge fan of the Neptunes, and missed their influence on this album's sound. <br /> <br />But after a few weeks, I have to admit the album has really grown on me.  Timbaland's producing style, while totally different from the Neptunes, does result in some really catchy tunes that I can't quite get out of my head.  It's nice to see Justin continuing to take chances with his music, and not get pigeonholed into any one sound (there's no trace of the \\"Michael Jackson sound-alike\\" on this album).  With this album, he's clearly gained confidence, maturity, and -- I didn't think it was possible -- more sex appeal. <br /> <br />A definite recommend, but prepare to listen to it a few times before you really love it.
B00005JLD4|4.0|After reading the book I wanted to see if the essence of the story would be uphelt in the movie and I wasn't disappointed. In fact I felt it helped me understand the enormity of what these girls accomplished!
B00005JPFH|3.0|There was just something about the first two Spiderman movies that made them good and watchable. Now I'm not saying this isn't good or unwatchable, but I am saying the director threw way too many ideas at it, and couldn't edit it good enough.<br /><br />My main problem always has been with the Spiderman movies Tobey Maguire. He's got the face of a little boy sometimes, and the hands of an old man. In my mind, he just doesn't fit as Spiderman/Peter Parker. Yes, he's a geek, but at some points, he's too geeky to BE Spiderman. Clark Kent was a hot geek. Tobey Maguire not so much.<br /><br />Spiderman 3 has a lot of special effects, some of the best being the effects creating Sandman, played by Thomas Hayden Church, who is connected to the first movie in some way (whatever could that be?), and throughout the film he is a bad guy. But watch out for the ending he actually turns out good. I wasn't too keen on the bad-guy-with-no-name, who later turns out to be called Venom. It seemed a little too contrived that the black goo just happened to fall on him and create another bad guy. I'm sure this worked out better in the comics but a bit more explanation on screen would be better.<br /><br />However, the movie does have its hilarious moments. The scenes with Bruce Campbell as the Maître d', who fails miserably to do his part in the proposal, with a hilarious moustache. Then there's J.K. Simmons, who plays Peter's boss. He was funny in the first two films, but he comes into his own in this, and practically steals the show in every scene. Especially with the long running joke about his high blood pressure, his temper, and how many tablets he has to take. Definitely a scene I will be re-watching over & over when I get the DVD. \\"Not that one!\\"<br /><br />I honestly did not see the point in Bryce Dallas Howard though. OK, bring a new love interest in, but some dumb blonde against Mary Jane? Not gonna work. Apart from evoking the green eyed monster in Mary Jane, there's not really much point in her being in the film. And she's underused to boot.<br /><br />I was forewarned that I would be cringing at one point during the film, and I thought \\"What could possibly make me cringe in a Spiderman movie?\\" How wrong was I?! I had my head in my hands, and not only was it a pointless scene, it felt like a very bad parody of Saturday Night Fever. Very bad parody. Accompanied by corny music, Peter Parker thinking he's turned into God's gift to women, complete with groin thrusting, must have been embarrassing for Tobey to film, but I hope it doesn't go to his head. Honestly. It's not an image I will ever get out of my head. I have to admit though, I did think he looked hot with the black suit/black shirt outfit. If his head suddenly disappeared inside the shirt of course.<br /><br />I did think James Franco deserved a bigger role in this film, especially with what happens. The whole goblin grenade to the face was just an insult, and then conveniently getting amnesia. Not good. He is turning into one of my favourite actors, and he is a bit of a good looking guy. But who's gonna be Peter's buddy now? Believe me, if you've got a heart of stone, you will shed a tear.<br /><br />I'm still not sure this was a good sequel to the Spiderman movies, and I have this baaaaddddd feeling they're going to continue the series, but Kirsten and Tobey have all said they really want to move on now. Hey maybe they'd bring in Jake Gyllenhaal instead! That would make it good. But they seemed to focus a lot of Mary Jane's jealousy and the cool special effects. Can't they just let them be happy?the film. And she's underused to boot.

0446677450|5.0|This is an excellent book about how money works. It is a must read for anyone who wants to become financially independent and who wants to spend more time with their family. Once you read this book you'll realize that having a job and working for money only turns you into a 21st century indentured servant.
B000MGUZMU|5.0|Everything about this album structurally and texturally is different than Funeral. But both are hard-driving, beautiful works that define the fear and magic inherent in modern life. Funeral was more magic and less fear, but Bible manages to avoid being sloppily polemical and expresses its emotions in a way that is more effective than a \\"I hate Bush and MTV\\" rant.

B000H305U0|1.0|So many people have been robbing Michael who in my opinion has paved the way for all these no talents particulary Justin TimberFake. Justin doesn't have a sound or voice of his own neither does Thicke. Both their falsettos don't measure up to Michael whose voice is truly unique. Alot of the young people today don't know anything about music and in their ignorance they probably think Justin and Thicke are the first to sing falsetto. Curtis Mayfield, Eddie Kendricks, Marvin Gaye, Philp Bailey, Michael Jackson and Barry Gibb all  perfected and were singing falsetto before the clowns like Thicke and TimberFake. The only reason why Justin sings in falsetto is to hide his real voice which is a nasel twine. He does a Michael impersonation and trys to fool the world that he is a real vocalist. I saw Thicke do an interview on VH1 soul and I nearly fell off my chair because I actually heard this dude compare himself to Marvin Gaye. At that very moment I'm sure Marvin turned in his grave.  I'm not a hater I'm just a fan of authentic music and these artist of today are not authentic their just posers ripping off the real thing and trying to fake the funk.I read alot of the reviews and it is really disturbing how some will compare this garbage of a album to Thirller. You people should be ashamed of yourselves. Michaels Bad album was more original than this.The dude even steals his dance moves from Usher.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Chris Martin is absolutely amazing.  Not only does he write his own music (unlike Brittney Spears, Christina Agulera, Pink, Jessica Simpson, and so many other cheesy singers), but his music and lyrics are absolutely fantastic.  If you pay attentoion to the lyrics, there is a much deper story to the entire album.  Moreover, there are so many creative twists and turns with not only the melody, but also the sudden introduction of bass that bursts the song into life!  My heart pounds with the beauty of Coldplay's music.  I would reccomend this CD to anyone [...]
B00005JPD0|4.0|The combination of talented Denzel Washington, with mega hit producer Jerry Bruckheimer and action thriller director Tony Scott help create an intriguing film shot in New Orleans around the time of Katrina.<br /><br />Washington plays Doug Carlin, ATF agent called in to investigate a terrorist bombing of a ferryboat on Mardi Gras Tuesday killing more than 500.  Washington who lost his partner played by Matt Craven in the inferno is alerted to the corpse of apparent victim of the blast, Claire Kutchever played by a fetching Paula Patton.  Autopsy results confirm that she's been killed before the explosion and has a connection to the bombing.  This evidence sets Washington on a different tangent as he teams up with FBI agent Pryzwarra played by Val Kilmer.<br /><br />Kilmer introduces Washington to a clandestine FBI operation headed by scientist Denny played by Adam Goldberg.  The scientific team using Eisteinian theory have created a device which enables them to pass through a wormhole to observe the past.  They hope to discover the identity of the killer.  Washington, in the dark when explained the technology gets the brilliant idea to use it for time travel to save Patton and avert the disaster by altering the past.<br /><br />Jim Caviezel playing super patriotic terrorist Carroll Oerstadt is creepily effective in his role as the bad guy.  Using some beautiful cinematography, well orchestrated special effects and a creative plot with similarities to \\"Minority Report\\", the film provides an enjoyable two hours of viewing pleasure, especially if you dont get bogged down in the nuances of the technology.
B000J4QWMC|1.0|After watching this movie for an hour I was hoping that it was going to get better but it didn't, it just got worse.  This movie serves no purpose; it is truly one of the worst movies I have seen.  It is a truly horrible remake of the same plot as Bad Boyz 2.  Bad Boyz 2 was a much, much better movie I might add.  This movie was not funny, it barely had much action, and the romantic plot of the movie was truly a disgrace.  This movie just failed in every category.  I should of listened to the reviewers when I saw the average rating to only be 3 stars but I thought that the movie couldn't of been that bad since it was directed by the director of Heat, but I was truly disappointed to see how horrible the movie really was.  Now I don't know what to do with the movie, I feel like snapping the DVD in half.  But I guess I'll just sell it to the used store, hopefully they'll give me at lest $1, if not, I'll give it away for free, that's how horrible this movie is.  Do not watch this movie, either watch Bad Boyz 1 or 2, they are much much better.  Collateral and Heat are excellent but this, urrgh, I get mad when I think about it b/c when you watch this movie you are wasting your life away.

0393035158|5.0|With the world heading towards religious war, Harris's ideas are more pertinent than ever.<br /><br />It is insane to think that in this day and age people are prepared to passionately believe things for which there is no evidence. My theory is that they don't genuinely believe them at all - they like the IDEA of religion but in their daily lives they operate based on evidence. If the boat is sinking are they gonna pray or are they gonna make for the lifeboats? Religion is merely a sop.<br /><br />The deepest attraction of religion is that it offers easy answers - \\"The bible says..\\", \\"it was God's will\\" - rather than doing the hard work of having to go out and find the answers based on evidence. Stem Cell research? No just ban it because religious leaders say the soul begins at conception. End of story.<br /><br />Harris's idea of reasoned contemplation that he discusses at the end of the book just sounds like too much hard work - better for your religious leader to tell you what to think.<br /><br />The most dangerous thing about religion is that religious people are prepared to destroy the world to save it, which in the end can only mean the end of the human race.<br /><br />Hopefully people may heed Harris's dire warning but the EVIDENCE so far does not fill one with any hope.
1596680199|5.0|Most polymer clay books inspire me with their beautiful photos.  This book has plenty of those, too.  But What I loved about this book is that it's laid out SO effectively.  Each page is packed with info.  For example, besides a basic recipe for a given bead, there are multiple suggestions for adapting ideas to one's own projects.  And I loved this feature: along the top of each page is a margin-to-margin mini-gallery of beads related to that project. No wasted space--two books worth of info in a single book.  If you've already experimented with a lot of recipes--and your main focus is beadmaking--I think this is a wonderful addition to your library.  If you're just starting out, this book is well-written with enough basics to get you going...and you'll continue to appreciate it over time.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Having found the 1996 BBC version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" (with Colin Firth; Amazon ASIN: B000F0UUT6) so comprehensively satisfactory, I was astonished to learn that somebody had set out to film the exact same material so soon (this version came out nine years later).<br /><br />Yes, so happy was I with that other version that I stood ready to denounce Keira Knightley as a toothy upstart who should sink back into the bog from which she arose and trouble us no more.<br /><br />But I can hold out no longer:  this version was so superbly acted and masterfully directed that I cannot help but pronouncing it well worth your time.  Not as good as the Colin Firth one, but still able to hold its own in every respect.<br /><br />Especially the directing and cinematography.  You really notice.
B000LXHK2C|3.0|This is a so-so film.  Russell Crowe plays himself -- arrogant, obnoxious, and unshaven.  One would think that with his income he could afford a razor and at least an occasional bath.  Albert Finney and Freddie Highmore were worth watching but Crowe hogs the film -- not unexpected given his monumental ego.  A little less Crowe and a lot more of the other actors would have greatly enhanced this film.  It has its share of product placements and a LOT of French and Frenchmen.  Overall the film was OK, the photography well done, the screenplay so-so, the personal hygiene below standard, but it was France after all.  Rent but don't buy.

I am a latecomer to reading her books after buying \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" which came highly recommended.  \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" is an unusual take on a child conceived solely for the purpose of being a matching donor for her sick sibling. <br /> <br />I feel you will be entranced by this storyline and after reading it will want to read every book she has written beginning with \\"Songs of the Humpback Whale.\\" <br /> <br />
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I have been using this unit for about 3 months now and have been pleased in its performance...  I purchased this at the same time as a 22\\" wide screen from Samsung (226BW, the stock stand is terrible), and was a little leery of the combination.  I knew the screen was around 10 pounds and the arm could handle up to 18, but the screen was much larger than the 19\\" that the manufacturer recommended.    <br /> <br />Thankfully this combination fits my needs quite well.  I can use the screen in portrait and landscape mode (using NVIDIA's software) which makes document typing a much more pleasant task.  Also I am 6' and my girlfriend is 5'6\\" (again the Samsung did not have height adjustment) so we can lower and raise the monitor to both of our needs.  The lift arm locks into place, which ensures that your LCD investment won't go crashing to your desk. <br /> <br />Not allot of complaints about this product but like everything it's not perfect...  The unit came with all of the swivel heads tightened down extremely tight, I actually broke the included allen wrench. Also the routing clips are made of cheap plastic while the rest of the unit is cast metal. <br /> <br />Like it or not I spend quite a bit of time on the computer and this product has made that time a little more pleasant. <br />

B000OMD4BG|5.0|Too many reviews focus on the mix and production value, rather than the music!  This CD is one of my favorite, as the songs span his career, and therefore have songs that could be on several of his older CDs.  My favorites are XO and Either/Or, and I wasn't crazy about the Basement CD.  I was hesitant to but this one, but I elated how amazing these songs are.  BTW, the mix is great!
B000NC4V32|4.0|It is a must have for Real Madrid fans all over the world. It is not an amazing movie, but it is fun if you like Real Madrid, and the stories are not bad.<br /><br />The worst part is the translation they did from widescreen to 4:3 screen (or could have been because of the translation from PAL to NTSC, I'm not an expert) but people have that thin-tall that makes it a little weird; although, after a few minutes you get used to it.

0736063684|5.0|This is an excellent book if you're not sure exactly which muscles are utilized during each exercise or if you're unsure which muscles are utilized with different grips. It is also a great book if you need new exercise ideas. The book is very well organized and is even color-coded so that you know how many different muscle groups are worked during the respective exercises. The book not only has pictures of how to perform the exercises but also describes what NOT to do and what injuries could occur if performed this way. Also, the pictures in the book are very high quality. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone that's serious about their workouts but needs some ideas to add a little variety or if you're simply trying to educate yourself to become more effective in the gym.

Every song is good to excellent and each song points in a different musical direction.  No fillers or junk where chord selection is flipped upside down and a similar song churned out. Fab four fabulous as usual!

0765316978|4.0|I enjoyed this book.    At first I thought it was going to be a fight to the death with the natives, or something like it, a la Frank Herbert and \\"The Jesus Incident\\".  Then that scenario's whisked away for something else (BTW, whatever did happen to the werewolves?), which is quickly replaced by something else, etc.    There are a couple of moments when you go \\"Well, isn't that convenient!\\", particularly when the special forces do their thing to the fleet, and the Consu technology shows up out of nowhere, but hell, that's just picking nits.  The bottom line is that I was hooked enough to read the whole thing in a couple of sessions over the weekend.    It's an enjoyable book where, in the end, all turns out well among honorable foes.

0743496728|4.0|Possible Spoiler Alert...  It's hard to argue with this book's reviewers -- both below and in other publications: Jodi Picoult is a prolific author.  Her books cover timely, thought-provoking topics, and force us to realize that there is always another side to the story: Picoult illustrates to a fault the dangers inherent in making assumptions.  Picoult's novels are also thoroughly researched, and 19 Minutes is no exception.  Not only do we encounter vivid, credible portrayals of school shootings, bullying and the criminal justice system, but the question of happiness and the \\"happiness quotient\\" as an underlying theme reflect Picoult's familiarity with recent research and current courses at Harvard and other college campuses.      That said, 19 Minutes somehow fell short of my expectations, or perhaps, fell victim to hype.  The characters are strongly developed and evoke our sympathy; the plot is tightly woven.  But very often, the narrative feels tired and perfunctory, and lapses into navel-gazing.  The story clearly illustrates that characters' lives are unraveling, coming unglued, falling apart, will never be the same; no need to reinforce these images literally.  Also, several reviewers remark on the unbelievable plot twist surrounding Josie's character.  If you've read Picoult, you knew something was coming.  This device -- almost a reverse deus ex machina -- is the hallmark of her novels, and maybe this \\"unbelievability\\" is really a symptom that it's wearing thin.  Picoult foreshadows Josie's actions almost from the beginning: Matt's behavior becomes at times violent and possessive, and then turns to loving tenderness.  The denouement is disappointing, and hardly seems worthy of Josie's character; I felt more manipulated by this twist than anything.  Why not use the events to teach her the double lesson of \\"What price, popularity\\" and \\"When to stand up for yourself by NOT standing by your man\\"?      Picoult has written roughly one book per year since her first book was published.  19 Minutes was certainly entertaining, but in the end it was too predictable.  One wonders if she shouldn't slow the pace a bit.

B000KGGLCU|5.0|Great live versions of old favorites and new ones.
B0001WANCM|5.0|FOD has always been one of my favorite movies.  As a man, I'm forced to admit its one of the few over which I've ever shed a tear (and yeah, continue to do so, every time I watch it).<br /><br />Its odd too, because I don't buy the \\"baseball is magic\\" concept.  Rather than being the \\"only consistent thing in America,\\" in my opinion, Baseball has accurately reflected America's ugly, selfish, and win at any cost philosophy.  Today, the sport (at least at the major league level, which is the focus of the movie) is in caos.  The owners only care about making money. They got rid of the Commissioner, the players spit at umpires, they're all taking illegal drugs, and the sport is promoting a steriod user as he tarnishes one of its most cherished records (Barry Bonds).  At its highest levels, the sport is tainted.  Even one of the main baseball characters in the movie, \\"Shoeless Joe Jackson,\\" was involved in one of th more famous betting scandals!<br /><br />For me, the move is better than baseball.  Its about the father-son relationship, the persuit of life's goals, accepting the reality of our own limitations, and making a success out of life by doing the best we can.  Perhaps its also about listening to and following that little voice in the back of our heads, we most often ignore.<br /><br />When the Burt Lancaster character steps over the line and away from his dream (once again), to save the little girl from choking, it reminds me of my own father (who was a physician, and is now deceased), and I lose it.<br /><br />Wow.  What character, what dignity, what a powerful moment.<br /><br />\\"I'd best be getting home now.  My wife will think I've got a girlfriend.\\"<br /><br />The whole thing is built on a bizarre premise and it defies all logic, but somehow it works, and works wonderfully.  Well written, good acting, nice camera work, and the music (those three notes!) all contribute to a wonderful experience.
0596009208|5.0|I purchased a few other books on Java and have found this one to be the best by far.  Unlike most texts on Java, it actually goes through and teaches the subject rather than just serving as a reference material.  Another great feature of this book is that it does not assume you already know C++ like most other Java books I purchased and subsequently put down after reading a few chapters.  This is a great book if you are new to object oriented programming and would like to learn Java without having to first learn C++ and/or object oriented programming principles as a prerequisite.

B000N6TX1I|5.0|I'm a fan of britsh sci/fi. (dog soldiers, 28 days later etc). They really get into the reality of a situation and this movie isn't any different. this is not an uplifting movie. When you think about it can you imagine how we would be if we didn't have any children for a few decades. This was a very thought provoking movie even if it is a bit depressing. Not sure if I'll ever watch it again (once is kind of enough), but that doesn't take away anything from it. It was actually very well done.
1577314808|4.0|This is my least favorite of his books ... only because I don't care for the question and answer style. AND that said, it is a clear guide to why and how to be in the NOW. It responds to all the questions one's mind can imagine ... and then some. And I have to admit, when I finished, there were no more questions in my little pea brain.
B000000P11|5.0|Bought this on vinyl in 87 or 88 and I'm not one of those people who  listens to old music. But I like this as much as when I first bought it way back when. It's really too bad these guys never found an audience. What a great band. Have the first CD, Script of the Bridge, which I also like very much but Strange Times is just a masterpiece. Not a bad cut on the whole thing. Amazing.

0618680004|4.0|Dawkins's argument against religion rests on natural selection and the anthropic principle, but also on ridicule. Dawkins employs natural selection and the anthropic principle to successfully counter the current understanding of intelligent design; he employs ridicule and disbelief to counter the argument for God from personal experience. (He is gleefully abusive in his choice of adjectives.)  <br /> <br />Dawkins fortunately distinguishes between two kinds of religion: 1) rational religion, which is in theory an acceptable human endeavor until it is debunked by the anthropic principle and evolution; and 2) revealed religion, which is a self-debunking excercise in naivety. With regard to revealed religion, Dawkins essentially says: \\"show me a sign and I will believe.\\" <br /> <br />Dawkins offers an important and trenchant challenge to theology. I sympathize with this. I also think, however, that he is lacking in imagination. This is not only true when he is thinking about religion, but also when when he is thinking (or not thinking) about the theoretical problems with his own position. He speaks again and again about the importance of explanatory \\"cranes\\" as opposed to mere \\"skyhooks,\\" but at a certain point his scientism, I believe, itself becomes a skyhook. Reason requires that the validity of a system be determined from outside the system. He does a great job attacking theology from outside of theology (and we should be glad for the challenge), but he does not ever step outside his own system to reflect on its limits. This is what makes his work more polemic--perhaps even religious--than philosophical.  <br /> <br />And it IS a religious book, and not merely in the negative sense of being anti-religion. Consider the following.  <br /> <br />Dawkins seems to think that the difference between a believer and an atheist is that the believer's consciousness has not yet been \\"raised by Darwin\\" (145). This consciousness-raising through the prophet of science, Darwin, isalmost like a conversion. What Dawkins cannot understand (and he admits it) is someone who understands natural selection well, but still believes in God. About this person Dawkins says: \\"at an intellectual level, I suppose he understood natural selection. But perhaps you need to be steeped in natural selection, immersed in it, swim about in it, before you can truly appreciate its power\\" (117). \\"Steeped,\\" \\"Immersed,\\" \\"swim about\\"...like in a baptismal font? It's like going to Jesus Camp! The greatest Darwin-idolatry occurs on p. 146, where Dawkins says that opponents to the indemonstrable multi-/megaverse theory only oppose it because \\"they have not had their consciousness raised by natural selection.\\" Since when did natural selection become a law of cosmological physics? He is arguing aesthetically, just like religion. (In one of the calmer parts of the book he admits as much, but it does not seem to slow him down.) <br /> <br />When Dawkins focuses on what is central--i.e. the exact problems with the argument for God and the specific details of natural selection as a master narrative for everything--he is at his most engaging, convincing, and least angry. It would be nice if he stayed there. The more he polemicizes against modern-day religion, the more fundamentalist he himself becomes. The angriness he has toward the religious world is the very same angriness that he decries within the religious world. He has tolerance only for the things he likes, and he takes it upon himself to state authoritatively what humanity does and does not need. Where does this authority come from? If there is no transcendence, to what source does a moral stance appeal? If it is an immanent (Darwinian) source, how does Dawkins manage to assert the superiority of his worldview over that of other people? He delights in the prospect of religion being wiped from the earth. Naturally he does not recommend using guns, but does that make his emotion any less violent? I find the irony overwhelming. It is funny without being at all funny. He abominates religion, but he freely adopts its form. Atheists should be a community unto themselves with support centers, publications, meetings, and missionary efforts, and should feel free to deride all those who believe differently. Where did Dawkins learn this behavior? Possibly from British print culture, but more likely from religion itself. It is an old truth that apparent differences often conceal hidden similarities. <br /> <br />Finally, Dawkins's alternative explanation for religion is very far from being a full explanation. He explicitly says (to his credit) that he can only propose a *principle* by which religion came about (i.e. the \\"by-product\\" theory), but he cannot offer a specific account of it. Of course he takes a stab at offering a specific account, but it soon becomes evident that you can stick anything and everything into this \\"by-product\\" theory of religion. A bit of \\"innate dualistic thinking\\" here, a bit of \\"gullibility-as-a-means-of-securing-the-transmission-of-survival-skills\\" there, add a dash of \\"intentional judgments,\\" and about 10 (or 100? or 1000?) other things and voila: you have (by chance) religion! (All this is complicated by the fact that \\"memes\\" don't leave a clear record like genes do.) In short, there is no way to create a stable Darwinian narrative of religion. EVER. Theology may be full of theoretical problems, but natural selection cannot give a specific, definitive theory of religion. Personal taste suddenly plays a bigger role than it seemed. Are we inclined to \\"swim about\\" in Darwinian theory till all cows are black? Should we be so inclined?
B000E5KJEI|4.0|The west is revisited in this beautifully transferred HD DVD version of the Academy Award winning \\"Unforgiven\\".<br /><br />Extras include a 1959 episode of \\"Maverick\\" featuring a young Clint Eastwood - most certainly a lot sharper than seen before - this is one of the high points that add great value to this HD DVD in my opinion. Hours of other extras about \\"Unforgiven\\" and about Clint Eastwood and his career also accompany this HD DVD.<br /><br />\\"Unforgiven\\" isn't the \\"best\\" western I've ever seen, nor does it quite capture an authentic west so much as it captures a more \\"studio-and-costumer\\" west, but that's just me. It is a gritty western painted with vigilante justice of severe consequences, along with life-lessons, old-west style.<br /><br />The performances were very nice - Gene Hackman played his character well, but I didn't quite \\"get\\" him...maybe a second viewing will do the trick. The story moves along a bit slowly, but plays out effectively. I didn't get \\"lost\\" in it, but I did like it.<br /><br />The lightning is clearly a studio lamp, but the low, rolling thunder sets a nice dark mood.<br /><br />I would guess that you've got to like westerns to like this film, as it may not make you a fan of the genre on its own, as the classics might. But as far as value goes, there are plenty of extras and the movie is well done.

Nothing like a small glass of wine in a low lit room while listening to that smoky-lounge/Peggy Lee et al/vamp voice.

B000001ELP|4.0|I just finished reading most of the 127 reviews on this album. Here are some quick retorts to some of the detractors.      1)The groundwork for Kiss's declining fan base was already set in motion: Dynasty (Die nasty); Unmasked; Peter Criss Solo Album; and the Bonus Tracks on Alive 2 (Anyway You Want It; All American Man; Larger Than Life)  Some even say that The Elder and Unmasked were the 1,2 punch. Not true.  The bonus tracks on Smashes, Thrashes...was like a kick to the groin, and while I was bent over gasping for air, Hot In The Shade came along and clubbed me over the head.    2)They're not atempting Progressive rock (ala. Yes, King Crimson) but creating a conceptual album in the vein of a BASIC rock n' roll band (The Who,The Rolling Stones). Both bands used orchestral music and such, with SIMPLE guitars.    3)I remember reading a 1983 Hit Parader magazine where Gene says \\"I love Music From The Elder.\\"  However, since the advent of grunge, negativity sells. Especially when it comes to selling anything Kiss. So they diss The Elder,and still do today.     And why would anti drugs and alcohol Gene let a producer \\"on drugs\\" (self admitted) take control of their careers at Kiss's most vulnerable time?    Well enough of that...on with the review.    Music From The Elder has many great moments and is in my top 3 Kiss albums.  Strong tracks include \\"The Oath\\";\\"Under The Rose\\";\\"Just A Boy\\"; and \\"The Odyssey\\".    It's true however, that you should listen to all 11 songs as an entire piece of music. I'm also curious to find out the real truth to what Ace is playing on. I have a hard time believing it's just one song.  Several solo's have a Dave Gilmour-esque quality to them. Especially \\"The Odyssey\\" which has a very magnanimous feel to it.     \\"The Oath\\" is one of Kiss's heaviest songs ever. Right up there with \\"Parasite\\" or \\"Almost Human\\".  Paul's singing is spot on, and complements this giant sounding rocker. After seeing Ace play this on the late night show \\"Fridays\\",I just can't believe he didn't see the potential. All he had to do was wait a little longer for his opportunity.  Eric Carr is also winding out on ***double bass drum on this tune, a first for Kiss up to that point. Let me also state that Eric Carr's drumming is once again superb, from the percussion filled \\"Dark Light\\" to a great tasty little fill at the beginning of \\"The Odyssey\\".    Let me finish the review with perhaps Kiss's crowning moment...\\"Under The Rose\\".  If your not taken back by this superior sounding track you are probably suffering from A.D.D.. It's pretty much jaw dropping and should leave you with goose bumps.  To have seen this played live on a an epic scale would have been.....oh well....    It's too bad this album flopped for them.  If \\"Creatures\\" pre-empted this, it could have been alot different.      If your a true Kiss fan, and can exercise a little patience, you should find this album at least musically impressive. It's a shame that fans are so close minded when it comes to The Elder.    Though I do admit, it's not a common trait of a typical Kiss fan to be musically diverse. Songs like \\"Love Gun\\" and \\"Nothin To Lose\\" are revered as great.     So remember Kiss Army before listening to \\"Music From The Elder \\"...You GOT GOT nothin to lose...\\" now that's embarassing.................    ****Footnote:  \\"Torpedo Girl\\" is actually the 1st double bass song.  But who knew?

B000GRUS22|5.0|I say this is music. I only write reviews on products I feel strongly about, and this is such a product. I was previously entranced by Enigma's last album, \\"Voyageur\\", for its genius, and now a new obsession has emerged: \\"A Posteriori\\". Masterpiece. Absolutely. Through its spacey auditory communique, this exuberant album seems to transmit its splendor directly from the heavens with the majority of its tracks. From \\"Eppur Si Muove\\" (Galileo's legendary or mythical phrase \\"And yet it moves\\") to \\"The Alchemist\\", Enigma built this album for the infinite: an homage to our cosmic ambition. The last track, \\"Goodbye Milky Way\\", was rather superfluous, in my opinion, as it did not fit the rest of the album: it relied on its lyrics (not something Enigma should do, for it hinders the music).<br /><br />The albums's highlights:<br /><br />- \\"Dreaming Of Andromeda\\" -Up-beat and dreamy (as the name implies), the two adjectives are rarely seen in correlation with each other, but they could not be more appropriate.<br /><br />- \\"Dancing With Mephisto\\" -Introed with a creepy cult-like chant it transforms into a electronic entity made for a dance around the bon-fire.<br /><br />- \\"Message From IO\\" -Interstellar morse-code put into rythmic bliss.<br /><br />- \\"Hello And Welcome\\" -The energy released throughout the track is amazing. It recalls that of some sci-fi hyper-space adventure.<br /><br />- \\"20,000 Miles Over The Sea\\" -A more appropriate title: \\"Ladies and Gentlemen, We are now Floating in Space.\\" This is my favourite on the album. By far the most dreaming and spacey, yet simple and elegant. The inital reason for purchasing the CD.<br /><br />- \\"The Alchemist\\" -Rock & Roll... Enigma style... kind of. Difficult to describe, but extraordinary none-the-less. Certainly a different breed of song altogether. I love it.<br /><br />All in all, Enigma never ceases to amaze. Deer caught in the headlights for this one. And it is grand. If you liked Enigma's previous album: \\"Voyageur\\" and are looking for a more upbeat tracks, look no furthur, \\"A Posteriori\\" is that voyage. Destination: that great galactic void. Prepare for take off.m: \\"Voyageur\\" and are looking for a more upbeat tracks, look no furthur, \\"A Posteriori\\" is that voyage. Destination: that great galactic void.

0618680004|2.0|Richard Dawkins attempts to show that the non-existence of God is a scientifically demonstrable likelihood, and that any belief in God is irrational and detrimental to the well-being of humanity.    You don't need to read more than a few pages of this book to see that Richard Dawkins is not very well-schooled in philosophy or argumentative discourse. Dawkins quotes Pascal, Kant and Wittgenstein, but if he ever actually read any of their works he appears to have gained nothing from the experience. Dawkins does nothing to address the most serious philosophical and scientific objection to his book: that the question of whether or not God exists is not a scientific one. What's worse, Dawkins systematically lumps all religious beliefs together with fundamentalism. The result is that the book is full of straw man argumentation: attacks on creationism and literal interpretaion of scriptures. Things that few people of faith actually believe.    Even Dawkins' attempt to explain religious behavior through evolutionary psychology is thoroughly unconvincing. Part of the problem with the book is that some of the theories that Dawkins presents as \\"science\\", especially cutting-edge stuff like memes, string theory and evolutionary psychology, are bleeding-edge paradigms for which the empirical evidence is sketchy at best. It's no good arguing that there is no evidence of God, then offering up explanations for which the evidence is not much better.    The only good argument that Dawkins makes is that perhaps governments should stop supporting religious institutions with public money. That thesis is difficult to contest. Why should agnostics and atheists subsidize other people's beliefs?    The question of faith versus science is not new. In fact, one of the fundamental themes in modern philosophy from Descartes onward is how to reconcile the religious view of the world with the scientific one. The thing that people like Dawkins fail to understand is that the existence of God is a value judgement and not an empirical one. My favourite book on the subject is still Kierkegaard's [[ASIN:0691020280 The Sickness Unto Death]], but there are countless others that offer much more depth, insight and convincing argumentation than Dawkins' book.
B000J103WK|5.0|After watching and listening to \\" Hell frezzes over\\" the standard in audio-video, concert watching and superstars jamming has been changed forever. <br />You know what I am talking about...however with the \\"Farewell tour\\" is just keep rising the bar...how high can it go? <br />Well the eagles have been rising even higher. Their wings have no knowledge of getting tired...they can push higher and higher... <br />On the recording part (audio and video) the HD shines in every aspect. <br />Boy I love HD! And of course I love Eagles! Nice symbiosis between the two!
B000NVIXFK|3.0|Well, it's better than Vapor Trails...barely.  There are some outstanding songs on this disc.  \\"Working Them Angels\\" and \\"Armor and Sword\\" are two cuts that stand out (to my way of thinking).  Yet, like the last 4 studio releases, it just seems like something is missing to me.  It's like Rush has lost their edge.<br /><br />To qualify myself, I've been a Rush fan since 1975.  I liked all of their releases through Moving Pictures.  Signals had to grow on me (it's now one of my faves).  Big Money was cool with me.  Hold Your Fire is about where they started losing me.  Roll The Bones brought me back.  Through the 1990s, I hung with them, but didn't really get their direction.  Furthermore, in my last novel, Rush was given credit in the \\"Acknowledgements\\" for \\"pretty much providing the soundtrack for my life.\\"<br /><br />So, all that to say that I think I'm qualified to critique a Rush record.  I was excited about this record.  I too had heard the comparisons to some of their older stuff (like Hemispheres).  I too heard this record had a harder edge to it than recent efforts (not true).  So, I had lots of expectations with this record.  You'd think, at 45 years-old, I'd have learned to never listen to rumors.  Suffice it to say that I've listened to the entire record 4 times now.  I took it out of my player today to listen to something else.  I don't know when it'll make it back to my player.  It will, but I'm in no hurry.  Does that tell you something?<br /><br />I love Rush.  Always have, always will.  But, like Vapor Trails, I just can't get excited about this disc.  It's a must have for any true Rush fan, but don't expect anything with a hard edge.  \\"Far Cry\\" is about as heavy as it gets.  Even the instrumentals (there are 3 of them) break no new ground.  Instrumentally and vocally, I see nothing challenging here.  During the glory years, you can be sure each new record held something challenging.  I guess those days are gone.  I'm sad about it.<br /><br />I love Rush so much, that I'm going to give it a couple of weeks and then listen to the record again 4 or 5 more times.  If I change my opinion, I'll be back here to say so.oing to give it a couple of weeks and then listen to the record again 4 or 5 more times.  If I change my opinion, I'll be back here to say so.

B000O1799U|5.0|Dreamgirls embodies the late 60's and 70's, the story of an all girl trio that overcomes diversity to become one of the biggest groups of it's time.  The story revolves around the  charachter of Effie White (Jennifer Hudson) and her rise and fall from the \\"Dreams\\".      What was initially a star Vehicle for Beyonce, the fims true standout was the performance by Jennifer Hudson.  Hudson's performance, to be compared with Barbera Streisands Debut in Funny Girl or Bette Midler in the Rose, was spiritual and truly transending.  A star is truly born in this performance.   Jamie Fox's role as Curtis is strong and Eddie Murphey's portrayel of a troubled drug abusing singer is the best of his film career.  Beyonce holds her own as Deena the lead singer of \\"The Dreams\\".  Beyonce's voice suits the simplicity of the era's music. The film is written and acted in a way that you connect with the struggles of the charachters.    Musically the film is strong.  Jennifer Hudson tackles the classics of Jennifer Holiday including a great new song \\"Love you I do\\".  Hudson outdoes herself on her rendition of \\"And I\\"m telling you I'm not going\\" and her soulful, heartwrenching \\"One Night Only\\" is trandsending.  Hudson's songs are the most powerful, the songs that actually portray the storys of the film.  Beyonce stands out with her voice embodying the simplicity of 60's music.  Knowles disco version of \\"One Night Only\\" is infectious with it's powerful bass line and effortless vocals.  \\"Listen\\" is indeed her crowning moment.  The song brings closure and redemption for her charachter.    Dreamgirls is one of the best films I have seen in recent years, and by far the best musical. To describe this film as a truly spiritual experience, is not an understatment.  Hudsons in particular was destined to play this part.  With a talented cast of newcomers and film veterans, if you are a fan of great music, you will enjoy this remarkable film.
0765348276|5.0|This book knocked me out - it was well-written, imaginative and thoughtful. It has all the creativity, intellectual and philosophical issues that are captured by the best SF, plus superb action and adventure. Moreover, it has wonderful lead characters, who were embued with real emotions, in addition to some great humor, and complex plot resolutions, all of which I enjoyed. I found myself thinking about the issues raised by this book and whether I would make the choices made by the protagonists.

But when Alfred Hitchcock made this movie: it changed the way you look at life and horror.<br /><br />This is more than a horror movie. There's suspense, and an ever building romance. The tension builds throughout this movie as the birds slowly begin to act abnormal.<br /><br />The scariest part for me is when they went after the kids at school ...probably because I was only a kid when I first saw this timeless classic.<br /><br />This is by far Alfred Hitchcock's best movie!

B000I2MRHE|5.0|My baby loves this new gadget which makes tummy time a fun activity. We started using it at 3 month and he was able to hold his head up for a minute at first, but I guess it strengthen his neck muscle  pretty well because he is able to enjoy it for at least 5 to 10 minutes at 4 month. Kids that young only spin themselves accidentely, but he loved the bright colors and the cringing sound of the fabric his hands touch. He also loves when I spin him around. I can't wait to see when he will discover that he can do it by himself. I would recomend this toy, and since two parts are detachable, you can use a mat by itself for senses explorations.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|Have been a huge fan of the show since it started.  I think it's only getting better.  Purchased the first season through Amazon, as our Australia version release didnt have the extra's which was totally worth the few extra bucks.  Thanks Amazon for the fast delivery.
B00004XQP4|5.0|If you love Green Day, you'll love this album. It's FAR from a sell out album. The guitar sound is just different, that's all. They turned the distortion down and it has a cleaner sound to it but the songs are still punk and they're still good. Give it a chance and listen through it before you hate on it.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|The cd set was awesome.  Well worth the money!! Both cd's are great!
B000065BPB|5.0|I bought these Sennheisers for my honey to wear in the shop (cabinet maker).  <br />He happily goes about his day listening to audiobooks, music, etc.  Very comfortable and effective in minimizing external noise (loud). And quite a deal!
B00003CXTG|5.0|Pearl Harbor is one of my favorite movies and I was thrilled with the way I could come to Amazon, order it and have it in my hands in a few days.  Great movie and great service.  Thanks Amazon.com
0316010669|4.0|This book was a terrific summer read.  You need time to read it...and then re read it.  Then to really think about it and begin to use it. <br /> <br />I have referenced it several times during the winter.  I read it last summer and finally broke down and bought my own copy recently since I had referenced it so often. <br /> <br />Loved it. <br />
B000O1799U|5.0|Once again the pricing & service are exemplary. <br /> <br />I received my product promptly within a few days of release. <br />Packaging was good & product is in excellent condition. <br />Haven't had a chance to watch it yet so can't comment on the film itself.
0977326403|5.0|This book is a cultural phenom.  So many companies have adopted it as a way of trying to grow and become and stay great.<br /><br />I have read it and sat through numerous retreats and discussions.  After a few times you can see who you are on the bus with even before they open their mouths.<br /><br />A great book to keep in your library.
B00005JPCF|5.0|Excellent as always. <br /> <br />Good service.  Prompt delivery.  Perfect condition.
0618680004|5.0|This book gives a good summary of the arguments relating to God. But its conclusion is by no means conclusive. Dawkins is an evolutionary biologist and a best-seller author. His argument may inevitably be limited by his own research field.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I love this soundtrack! <br />The music is perfect to listen at work or driving.
B000NQR7NO|5.0|If you liked \\"Whatever people say I am, thats what I'm not\\" you'll like this cd 200% better. At least I do. \\"Brianstorm\\" is a frenzy of clashing noises that hits all the right notes. but goping past the single, songs like \\"Balcava\\" and \\"Do M a Favour\\" really set the mood, I feel, in the cd. You get a sort of sense the whole album is influenced by a burnout life style. in a couple of songs the times the lead singer spits out are so wrong you get a sort of hazy feel. This is definatly gonna be on the bands to watch list for me.
0060594896|5.0|Great, wonderful, insightful, fabulous, down to earth, practical, step by step way to change your results, directions to live the life of your dreams. And beside all that it is a great read!<br /><br />His program to promote the great white book is incredibly generous. Jack sincerely shares his love and wisdom. His light really shines through. He is an inspiration to me to get out there and do it whatever it is better and bigger and with more gratitude and joy.<br /><br />A MUST READ FOR SURE!!!!!!!!!!!
0060574216|5.0|Very good read could save time and money in avoiding counselling. Clearly indentifies the sign posts in situations and advises best course of action, even if that is not to say a word particularly when man is thinking in his cave!!! Also great for identifying how ones own behaviour can be causing confict, to recoginise this and adjust. <br /> <br />
B000NVIXFK|3.0|I have listened to this album multiple times now and keep coming back to the same conclusion:<br /><br />Rush is 'almost back'.<br /><br />What do I mean?  Listen to Spindrift.  REALLY listen to it.  Listen to Geddy's vocals.  VERY reminiscent of \\"Between the Wheels.\\"  This is the Geddy that has been missing since Hold Your Fire.  Higher vocals with some emotion and bite.  Yet he makes and all-too-brief appearance on Snakes and Arrows before returning to his comfort zone of the past 20 years of lower, plodding vocals and WAY-OVER-USED vocal harmonies.<br /><br />The other new-old-new presence is more keyboards, though not enough for me.  Even in the 'classic' days of Farewell To Kings through Moving Pictures, keyboards played a pretty big part.  Then came Signals through Hold Your Fire (btw i LOVE this period of Rush as well), and Rush was accused of becoming over dependent on them.  So what did they do?  They basically all but abandoned them and tried to return to 1974.  Why?  Hasn't Rush been around long enough now to know that what makes them great is BALANCE?  Wasn't Neil the champion of balance (hello... Mr. Cygnus?)<br /><br />My point in all this babbling?<br /><br />1.  Geddy, please...sing HIGHER.  You are more emotional when you do so and it gives you more options with vocal melody lines.<br /><br />2.  Geddy, please... LOSE THE VOCAL HARMONIES.  They don't work.  They never worked for you and never will.  Even vocal lines that could have been good become boring because of them.<br /><br />2.  Bring back more keyboards, but you don't have to drown in them!  It gives you more options musically and will maybe help to re-expand who you guys are as musicians.<br /><br />If Rush could just continue on in the spirit of Spindrift and The Main Monkey Business, we could finally see the Rush we deserve to hear and the Rush they deserve to be again.<br /><br />Peace.
0618680004|5.0|If you are agnostic like I was, this book may arm you with the reasoning to believe that atheism is the most rational and humane direction to turn. Brilliant.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|what can I say I saw this tour & I still get chills watching this!!! I LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!!!!
032147404X|1.0|This book was disappointing.  It should be titled \\"An Introduction To Digital Photography\\".  An example would be that halfway through the book 2 pages are dedicated to why one should use a filter and a lens hood.  I was hopeful that there would be some tips or tricks that were not rudimentary but there were none to be found.
