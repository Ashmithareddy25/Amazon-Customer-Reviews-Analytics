030758836X|1.0|When I started the book, I found it quite interesting and unique. The ending feels like a gotcha.  Hated it,  I would not reccomend this book to anyone.  I feel like I need to shower to get the awful ending off of me.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Great story!  Really enjoyed the complexity and growth of the characters.  Haven't seen the movie, but loved the  book!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I love this app because I can check several different news feeds all in one place. It is easy to use and great for someone who is a news junkie.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I played this game and it was fun. Lots of challenging puzzles. If you like brain teasers, this game is for you. I heartily endorse this product.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|One of the perks of Amazon Prime, you get to enjoy free shows and movies! I had watched the first season of Downton Abbey on Netflix and was looking for the 2nd one when I discovered Amazon instant video. Great find!!
B003DXSXCI|5.0|A classic thriller with great car chases done without the aid of CGI. Plus it impressed me they could make turns that fast in cars without power steering!
B00821OX98|5.0|The writers of this show are very creative! We really enjoyed it. The whole family can watch this show and you don't have to worry about a bunch of unnecessary sexual nonsense that has nothing to do with the plot! Like most tv shows out there. If you like Syfy you will enjoy it! Oh and Season 2 is even better!
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is so awesome. My dad and I enjoy it so much it's even better than galaga and it's graphics are way superior
B006MW3UZW|5.0|First of all, I'm quite sure I was one of the last holdouts for watching this popular series. I'd seen reviews and write-ups and still thought it was going to be an 'Upstairs, Downstairs' ripoff. But it's not. And thank goodness for Amazon Prime Videos, because after we watched the first few episodes of the first season, we were hooked and watched the remaining episodes to the end of season 3. Now we're waiting - impatiently, I might add - for season 4.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the manners, gentility, and class culture of England in the 20's, you'll most probably be hooked too! At the very least it will help you to appreciate the freedoms and equality we take for granted today.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Simple but plenty of fun.  Definitely a great faotd.  Wish there were more this entertaining. Word word word word word
B0071XO8RA|5.0|That was an amazing book in many senses. There's been some time since I've read something so original, well thought out, and even better written. It's really hard to explain this jewel of a book, even though I've always been one for fancy words and explanations. In this case however I think you should simply read it and understand \\"Wool\\" and the emotions is brings for yourself alone. All I will say is that every minute spent over these pages is more than worth it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS BOOK!!!! I couldn't stop reading!!! I recommend this to a true lover of suspense. Buy a copy NOW!!!!
B009XTF8JM|5.0|This movie is in a special category. It has an excellent plot and the most awesome part about it is that there is no sexual stuff. There are a lot of horror movies that get ruined (in my opinion) with a bunch of people talking about nasty stuff and doing nasty stuff. What is the world teaching our children? You can't watch cable without hearing about erectile dysfunction! I don't want to answer that question from my 11 yr old. Ok off the subject, long story short a must see for people that like scary movies without the nastiness. Family friendly if your children like scary movies.
B00571F26Y|4.0|A friend recommended that I read this book and I did in less than a week. It is very informative, gives lots of scientific basis for the statements, all has been tried on actual people and lots of experience harvested. I like to be informed and this author does a very good job - in addition he is also funny, the puns and jokes are refreshing in a world where a lot stuff is sooo serious. Thank you for good data and a good read that can be applied for better health immediately. I am an avid wheat-watcher now!
B0099G4Y26|5.0|I DO LOVE ME SOME PINK AND YOU WILL TO, ALWAYS A HARD EDGE TO HER MUSIC THANKS AMAZON GREAT DEAL!
0062082353|5.0|This book has kept me reading for hours upon hours. I can't put it down. Chris Kyle has a way with words that sucks you in and allows you to see the horrors of war through a military perspective. It makes me want to join in the fight. Fantastic read.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|Not one for chat. I agree with all the positive reviews. This case is nice, put some leather conditioner on it and it will last a long time. I don't know why some people gave bad reviews; I guess some people would complain if you hung them with a used rope instead of a new one.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love it!!! I sit and play this game for hours! With that being said I am in my 40's so to like a game that much is so funny when my son, who is 21 and loves to play this game too, says it is his turn...lol. I do share though and I think it's a real good game for the mind.

0896898288|3.0|This is a nice book, not a great book.  I had recently purchased two other books that were similar in nature, but from a different author.  Here is the jest of it.  During the 20's a popular magazine, The Farmer's Wife, had a contest for the readers. They asked the question, &#34;If you had a daughter of marriageable age, would you, in light of your own experience, want her to marry a farmer?&#34;  The magazine was surprised and overwhelmed by over 7,000 responses.  As substantial cash reward, especially for those times, was offered to the top 68 letters.  The winning letters and 111 quilt blocks inspired by them, are published in the book.  I thought that the blocks would be historically accurate blocks from that time period, maybe a little insight as to why they were named what they were.  I was wrong.  I am not sure exactly who was inspired to choose the blocks chosen, but was disappointed when I realized that these are common blocks, just named differently.  For example, the block commonly known as churn dash in this book is named Wrench.  It was the same with the other similar books I purchased.  My biggest complaint with this (these) book(s) is the lack of directions for the blocks.  It is up to you to draft them off and make them.  I like actual details.  ie...cut four A pieces 2 inches by 2 inches. All the cutting directions are listed with directions for sewing each block in a separate section of the book.  The best thing about this book, from a quilting stand point, is that it does come with a CD for the computer to print off templates for the blocks.  If you are looking for a book from a quilting stand point, it may not be the best choice.  If you are interested in history, this is a pretty good choice.  The letters are reflective of the values and feelings of the time, are a truly wonderful insight in to the life and heart of actual women of the time.  While the writers of these letters were not world leaders, not famous for any recognized achievement (finance, scientific) they were responsible for raising up the next generations of people that made our country what it is today.  So, for that reason alone, I am happy to have this book. I am a history nut.inance, scientific) they were responsible for raising up the next generations of people that made our country what it is today.

B004PHE9F6|5.0|The 'in-car' photography is fantastic. As a viewer, we get to see real 'heel-and-toe' downshifts. These cars are being driven by the actual F1 drivers of the time, many of whom were later lost to us. Another 'must-have' addition to an enthusiast's library.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|fun game if you like bingo ... watch out though, it is addicting!  my husband and daughter are now addicted as well!!  don't say you have not been warned!!
B00B29J0I6|5.0|I have to be ready to spend time with this game because I have a real hard time turning it off.  It's an intriguing mental exercise on how to meet the challenge of each game.  Some are so simple and others require greater determination to win by thinking it thru.  If you like puzzles this is &#34;The Game.&#34;
B0054SMID0|5.0|Nicely done with some surprise course changes.  Great acting and screenplay.  More a guy flick, but could be enjoyed by other adults.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The blu ray had all it's disks and they all worked Great..... I really enjoy Game of Thrones show and i can't wait for season 3.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|i bought it for my wife. she got the first two season as a gift from mom and she was looking for the new season. just find in amazon and bought right away. i watched little bit of third season it was good but complicated relationships doesn't make me interested. if you like action, this not for you. completely perfect drama.
B00BCZU8WM|2.0|I'm really not sure how this can be classified as music.  It's like Animal Collective with an actual melody.<br /><br />The music is a bunch of electronic hodgepodge and I'm not really sure what anyone would find appealing about it.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I laughed and laughed! It was really funny but I have never seen the original show. There was some really great one liners!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|It's not free on here but is well worth the price. I can't stop playing! Expansion pack a little pricey but well worth it to support this game.
B009KEN87O|5.0|seriously thought this was going to be terrible as the free app of the day but BOY was I wrong. super fun, well done.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Read this book.  I know the television series is popular, but give your brain a little exercise and read the series instead.  It's worth it and the imagery is phenomenal so you will not be missing out.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I downloaded this for my kids and I find myself playing it just as much as they do. It's so addicting
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Feedly has become the most-used app on my Kindle Fire. Nice, clean, modern interface for perusing news feeds. Love the swipe-based controls. Very nicely done.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|This is the best series I've seen. Great story lines well filmed, believable and keeps you on edge for the whole 4 Seasons. Must watch.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Love the game but hate the ads that pop up before EVERY game. This is only app that I've purchased that does that!!!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I like it a lot .  It was fun.<br />My whole family get hook on Thu game. Good thing that I have been a great way to get the best possible price for this.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I haven't found many books like this. I love it! Much action, grief, and happiness all put into one book!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It awesome only words to describe it is just amazing. The graphics a really great. And it's really fun and difficult.
0545123275|3.0|Cute story about a girl who falls in love with a werewolf. The wolf watches her from the woods and vows to do everything he can to become human so he can stay with her. Sam is a sweet, emo boy who reminds me too much of Edward Cullen. He falls in love with Grace, a young woman who has been fascinated with the wolves in the wood behind her house since she was a little girl. When Grace is attacked by the wolves, Sam saves her and a bond is established between the two.<br /><br />The novel is okay. There isn't much going on except Grace trying to protect the wolves from frightened adults wishing to kick back after some teens turn up missing. She also wants to hide Sam from her ever-absent parents and think up ways he could stay human for her. My issue is the way parents are described in these books. Most parents love their children and they care what happens to them. Writers who depict parents as total clueless idiots for the sake of writing a story are just lazy and I really find this tiresome. Granted there are clueless, neglectful parents out there, but I think the majority of the readers are going to better identify with characters who have great parents. It is totally unrealistic to have stable teens coming from abusive or neglectful backgrounds. Both Sam and Grace should not be as stable as the author makes them to be taking their backgrounds into account. How Sam isn't psychotic after what he has been through is beyond me.<br /><br />Aside from the parents-as-idiots gripe, it was an entertaining read and I plan on picking up the sequels
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Once you start to watch season 1 then Season two you will be hooked. Im wondering how its all going to turn out with all the twist and turns just when you think you know whats going to happen something happens you weren't expecting. Must See from start, Season one.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|This is one of the all-time best movies ever made.  If you like the &#34;classics,&#34; this is a movie you have to own.  No fancy effects, just good solid dialogue and acting.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|have 5 invicta watches love them all ..hooked ..the only problem i dont know which one to wear each day
B003WE9TU8|4.0|I really liked the book. The way of writing and how the whole &#34;event&#34; is described through the eyes of survivors.<br /><br />However would have been great if few characters overlapped in at least few stories to give it some more depth. But thats just my opinion.<br /><br />All in all worth the money and time.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I bought this twice I love it so much. very challenging. the game sucks you right in. You should. try it out
0545259096|2.0|I have now completed this series and I have to say that it just wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be. I never really bought into the relationship between Sam and Grace. It was just not believable. All the characters were flawed, and that is okay, but flawed to the point of being unrealistic with the exception of Isabel. This really surprises me because I liked her the least of all the characters. I really hated her for being so spineless when it came to facing her murderous father. But she comes through in the end.<br /><br />Sam was such wishy-washy emo boy that I really didn't understand what Grace saw in him. I can only think she fancied herself in love with him as a very young girl because he saves her life. The person he becomes, though, is not a person who you'd want to spend your life with unless you enjoyed telling him what to do. So, I find it hard to believe he'd have any clout as a leader to a pack of werewolves. Maybe he makes a better wolf.<br /><br />This third installment puttered along...some parts were more engaging than others, while others were just plain boring. The Rilke poems did nothing for me. They were just a gimmick to prove to the reader that Sam is this unbelievably romantic guy. All it does is compound his \\"emo-ness\\". The whole romance between Sam and Grace seemed forced in my opinion. I just did not feel it no matter how much the author kept describing it. Perhaps she tried too hard.<br /><br />I didn't feel like there was any closure in this series and that is disappointing. Stiefvater never really shows you what was going on in Beck's head. What propelled him to make the choices he made? How can he be so good when he's committed such atrocious monstrosities? Sorry, but here is a character who is a total contradiction. He makes no sense. She also leaves the happily-ever-after up in the air, but takes an extra page to tell you she is done with the series? Say, what?<br /><br />I picked these up after I read The Scorpio Races, which I really enjoyed, so I was hopeful. These books were written prior to it so I guess she is getting better with time and practice. This one didn't do it for me.<br /><br />Forever-2 stars<br />Series-3 starsh I really enjoyed, so I was hopeful. These books were written prior to it so I guess she is getting better with time and practice. This one didn't do it for me.<br /><br />Forever-2 stars<br />Series-3 stars

B00AZMFO9U|5.0|Best movie in the last several years!  This subject has been addressed before but has all fallen short.  However, this movie is nothing short of great!
B0006J28L4|5.0|I have watched the film before but i actually bought it because of the part 2 which showed clips of talks by Malcolm X. I will recommend the DVD for Black History Studies
B00006J9OV|3.0|The highlight of this recording is the great baritone, Kurt Moll.  The production is so faithfully naturalistic that it's, well, kind of boring.  And the direction doesn't help:  Moll's singing is ethereal, but for the most part it's like he's giving a recital.  Jerusalem is variable, at times shouting more than singing.  And the conducting by Levine -- while he pulls gorgeous sound out of the orchestra, his tempi are just too slow.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So good!<br />This book is addictive! I cannot wait to read the others! It has it all...romance, love and mystery.
B00A85EMVK|1.0|I thought the overall movie quality was terrible. The video was grainy and snowy through the entire movie. Interestingly enough the video quality at the menu screen looked fine.<br /><br />I would not recommend this at any price.
B0091REZMW|4.0|its a cool app. I like it alot except for the energy bar....that's annoying. but otherwise you should get it.

B009LH1Y1W|5.0|My husband and I got addicted to this show and watched the first 7 seasons on Netflix in like 4 weeks!  Really enjoying the 8th season on Amazon instant.  Thanks Amazon!
0142410314|2.0|The Good: The book is written well for its intended age group, vocabulary and structure-wise. And at least I couldn't hear the creepy Oompa Loompa's singing.<br /><br />The Bad: I'm probably in the minority here, but I just did not like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (or its movies). Grandpa can't get out of bed to help the family, but if there's chocolate involved he's all spry and nimble? And sure, Charlie is the hero to root for, but what are your other options when all of the other children are atrocious? The book was definitely a cute idea, but just failed to deliver on just about every level for me.

1432794426|5.0|I have read just about every book that I can get my hands on about Michael and this is by far the best book out there.  So much information that we, his fans are looking for not the usual few nice comments and then the nasty, vicous things that have been written.  Just the good things that we want to hear.  I had the opportunity to borrow my friends copy of this book and i loved it, so I in turn bought my own copy and wlll probably read it again and again.  Loved it.  Thanks Karen for loving our King.

However,it is very difficult to open, edit, save and close an existing document. When I do, it is still there open in another window. Can't seem to get out of the edit mode. What am I missing? This was not happening previously. Can I not edit with the free version?

B00BWJARHO|1.0|I have read the books, watched the original live-animation movies in the theaters, enjoyed the three previous movies, but this one?<br />I just spent four bucks to watch a whole twenty minutes of the movie. I kept fast forwarding it.<br />This is slow and I mean slow. 10 minutes is like an hour.<br />There is no excitement but mostly there is no chemistry among the actors, it is a bad movie.<br />Wait for the 1 dollar rental at Redbox. Don't waste your money or time on this movie.
B007NG93CK|4.0|A good read as usual.  Kathy Reichs is one of my favourite authors and this book is no exception. I recommend it

B000L53D4O|3.0|I bought this for my nephew who about a yr old and learning standing and walking. Thought this would help him with the walking, but the front is too light that it kept flipped backward causes him to lost balance and fell down everytime. He's a small boy for his age too, so it's not his size that causing the flip. Other stuffs on it look great and he played with it for a bit. After couple times, they put it away.

Possibly one of the best games out there for Kindle Fire.<br />Pros:<br />-Good multiplayer<br />-Many weapons; there is a shop which has tons of things<br />-In game currency isn't hard to get your hands on without real money<br />-Good singleplayer story line<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Glitches every once in a while; not too often<br />-Not for kids, the characters swear a lot and there is blood and gore (able to be turned off)

My daughter is very disappointed.  She has several other Temple Run games on her Nabi 2 (1, 2 and Brave) and they work fine.  Not sure what is up with this one.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Got really exciting, then letdown.  Never going to read a second or third novel from any author.  They put Ll the effort into the first one, which is usually awesome, the the next ones are total let downs.
B004BLJQOK|4.0|Spooky, scary and creepy all at the same time! I am not going to go over what all the other reviewers have said. It's a good movie with some great scenes! I am not a fan of scary flicks, but I liked this one!  It took me awhile to crawl out from under the bed though!
B002VHI8FE|3.0|Mr. Abercrombie writes in an easy to understand style. I give him credit for this. My personal interests lower my score as I do not enjoy the &#34;anti hero&#34; style characters. There was no clearly defined role of good guy while there were plenty of well defined bad guys in the story. If you enjoy this type of story telling, than this book is right up your alley.
1611134226|4.0|Always love the storys by Preston and Child even if they are a little far fetched. They always have the best reader of any audio books.
1594744769|5.0|The book itself was a tad weird, but it was amazingly fantastic. It arrived early and was a complete joy to read. I can't wait for the next one!
0307742997|5.0|My cousin read this and recommended it to me.  It was a great novel.  Normally I can figure out &#34;who done it&#34; but this one kept me on the edge of my seat and I was quite surprised at the end to read who the culprit was.  I recommend it to anyone who loves myseteries.
B0063M22QO|4.0|It could have more levels, but overall a nice basic Mahjong game for average players.  Worth the very reasonable  price.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I am almost 13 and I love the new super Mario bros. So I bought this app and love it I recommend it to everyone. Smurfs village is my all time favorite on my kindle then this game.
1451696191|5.0|The book so far is really good. It arrived at the earliest date and I quickly delved into it. I wish I had more time to finish it though.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I read this book in one day, very well done. The love story is nice and the suspense keeps you reading. Great book, now I want to see the movie.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Great series. Had bought season 1& 2 from PBS direct. Better pricing here. Can not wait till season four .
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Those game is very fun and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a fun game and has kids who like horses
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|Drew me in the from the first show.  Crazy how people can join a cult like that, although I am now a follower..LOL
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game.  Kids love it too.  like that it is leveled so that can actually learn the game.  I might try to add another suit soon.
B0013FSXT6|1.0|That movie I received was in a BluRay box but the resolution of the movie is actually in standard definition not BluRay.<br />Highly disappointed in this transaction in which I've been deceived into buying a lesser product for the cost of the actual product.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I picked up this book because I thought it would be mostly about a solo hike on the PCT, but I found that it was also about her getting closure on some events that rocked her life off balance.<br /><br />I'm not really into self help or mental health books, but Strayed's writing sucked me in and left me feeling sad that the book was over. She included events that really made her out to be a not so good person, but I ended up liking her anyway. I wish more was included about the actual trail, but either way this is an excellent read.<br /><br />This book is well written. I borrowed the kindle edition from my library, but I liked it so much I'm going to go buy a copy to keep on my bookshelf.<br /><br />People who will probably like this book more than others: outdoorsy women, hikers, 20's-30's crowd, free spirits, people dreaming of an escape from the rat race, and people dealing with a personal loss or major life change.....all of which I fit into which may explain why I enjoyed this book so much.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Love the movie, the 3D that Disney does is always great.  It's a wonderful movie for both children and adults.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I enjoyed The original space invaders this is a good copy of it. easy to play and yet very challenging. I think I'm becoming addicted.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|Ads pop up after every screen, very annoying.  Game is not too bad, but the ads distract from the fun of the game.
B00632HWOG|3.0|Not the greatest, not the best. There is nothing unusual, different or earth shattering , just like the other ones. As they say, Same S***, Different Day.
B008I3RARW|5.0|I absolutely love the app. It works great and moves fast. App is really cool and I really enjoy it.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Many autobiographies read like a dull conversation you can't escape.  It's one is exactly the opposite. It's gripping and interesting to the last page.  Chris was a real hero - he will be missed!
B005EGXM7I|5.0|The item was as described and arrived on time without any problems! I would definitely recommend this product and this seller! This is my favorite series! I really love it when I find a tv show or a movie that also has a book to go long with it. Very well written!
0062014536|3.0|I was so hyped up to get this book. I was so excited to read it, and didn't put it down and finished it in two days. The story progresses alright, I liked returning to Portland with Hana's point of view and was glad to know we weren't just gonna leave her not knowing what happened to her...however the end is SO open ended it leaves you wondering if Oliver is going to write another book at some point. I really feel like I have no closure.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I absolutely love the app. It works great and moves fast. App is really cool and I really enjoy it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple rin 2 is a fun game with cool graphics, very addicting game. I enjoy playing in my down time
B005MYEPXC|5.0|A must see!! A lovely spellbinding movie featuring famous artists of bygone eras delightfully blended into a modern day love story. Laughs and pathos and love Woody style in Gay Paree!
B00164GDA0|4.0|This is a cute movie that pulls at your heart. I would not suggest it for children, as there are some bad language issues, but my wife and I enjoyed it immensely. The reason I am giving four stars is, though this is a blu ray, they clearly did not remaster it into 1080p quality. It is granny on my 115 inch screen. I know most people do not have that large of a screen, but I usually expect a clearer picture of of blu ray movies.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|I absolutely love the app. It works great and moves fast. App is really cool and I really enjoy it
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Great action packed movie and one of the best Batman's. I have not used the digital copy yet myself. Would definitely recommend.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|No plot, no dialog, no explosions, no car chases. A visual feast in beautiful Blu-ray hi-def.  Just fantastic pictorial visions that will that will totally enthrall.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is the best! Really exciting. Better than Temple Run 1. Enjoy the game! Really fun. Like the one creature than the like 20!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very realistic I love horses so love pretending I have some<br /><br />Would recommend this game highly. You can play without having to buy internet content
B004SBX112|5.0|I love this game. I had no problems downloading it to my Kindle and it is a game I would suggest to anyone who has enjoyed other angry bird games.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I have mostly enjoyed this film, but there are certain areas that I feel were missed opportunities and a tad disappointing.<br /><br />There was no question I was going to purchase this film, after the impressive LOTR trilogy, and knowing there are masterful people who worked on (and are still working on) what will be the Hobbit Trilogy. I'm not going to give any spoilers or specific examples* of where I felt it fell short, but I mourn for some of the charm of the book which just didn't come across in the film. I'm not a purist - I realize changes have to be made to tell a story - that's not what I have a problem with. As long as the changes are sensible and add something to the story, as long as key features of the original work are not lost in the transition, then I would have no complaints.<br /><br />Having said that, The Hobbit is still a fun ride. I will re-watch the film many times, I'm sure, and would be interested in a version with extended scenes. I still love the world-building of Middle Earth, and, having read the book, my mind is sort of filling the gaps the movie missed, and sort of editing out what I don't agree with. I'll purchase the 2nd and 3rd parts of this trilogy, I'm sure, and who knows - maybe they'll be better than this first part.<br /><br />*(ok - one small, semi-specific complaint which really irks me: how did they manage to not suffer tremendous injuries after all they went through? if you've seen the film, you'll know what i'm talking about. just pushed the limits of credibility a bit too far for me. with the wonders of CGI, it seems too often the temptation is to put in sequences that would be impossible to survive without getting hurt.)
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Enough Sound of Music to last a lifetime.  I bought this for my mother who loves this movie.  Extra features were ok....can't expect too much from such an old, classic movie.
B007REV4YI|4.0|It's was hard to tell what the overall point of the film was - is it the beginning - or the end?? It was certainly watered down and not at all typical 007 fare. Not that it's a bad thing - it could have been called Spy vs Spy and it would have been fine but IMO a few of the characters seemed out of place. Had a few predictable moments and a few twists and not as much humor as I would have liked. Slow at times and fast paced the remainder, it will keep you engaged for the most part. More of a character development movie and for hardcore fans this will be a let-down, but since I'm not a hardcore fan it was fine with me.<br />Great sound, SPEFX and music - recommended whether you're a JB fan or just enjoy a good shoot-em-up spy thriller.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This is an extremely addicting game.  Anyone who purchases this game will have many hours of entertainment. It is a game you will want to play over and over.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I don't normally shell this much for a book, but I took a chance on this series, and felt like I definitely got my money's worth. Patrick's rendition of the rise of a magician in the KingKiller Chronicles paints a complex, yet coherent world filled with intrigue, interesting characters, a well-thought out system describing classes and casts. The story that unfolds through it felt grounded and a genuine pleasure to read through, and it also felt long enough that I didn't feel slighted for it's higher price-point.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|very erotic and well written, didnt want to put it down and couldnt wait to pick back up....great book to spark your relationship!
B000DWMN2S|5.0|I haven't checked this product but I love the movie.  Looking forward to watching it again sometime.  Great product. Great price
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|The movie was very scarey! So I recommend it but not for kids/ rental price is low and simple to rental
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Got hooked on the characters and story of Downton Abbey and enjoy these dvd's very much. Recommend this product highly.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is amazing a least that is what my friends say I am. downloading the game right now and by the picture looks like I am going to fake sick and stay home too play the game while I lay on the couch all day and do nothing but play this game and feel sorry for the people in shcool
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Loved the book.  Had a little trouble at first getting into it, but once I did was glad a persevered.  One of the best books I've read lately.  Loved the style of writing.  I will definitely seek out all of her books.
B009O07NDY|5.0|Relive the movie as you listen to the talent that Howard Shore posses!<br />I love the vocal songs and especially the Song of the Misty Mountain by Finn.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|I really enjoyed it...you can almost hear the stupid yet amusing banter of Castle and you can almost  see Beckett's eyes rolling into the back of her head
B002ZBRSMK|1.0|this was nothing like I expected, It started out like star man then rambled on with lots of sex, and horrible dialog. I kept watching and waiting for it to pay off but alas, the ending was very depressing. I wish I could get back the 2 hours of my life watching this.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I enjoyed this book and the banter between the characters.  I recommend this book to people that like the romance genre and want an entertaining fast read.
B00BMVTS1S|4.0|Being a Lord of the Ring trilogy fan, I anticipated that I would thoroughly enjoy the first in this prequel.  It was a little too drawn out for me in the beginning; but once the story started to unfold, I was hooked. Glad I did not see it in the theater, but at home where I could take a break. Will definitely watch it again.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|Hated to watch it like this, should of just bought the dvd<br /><br />The format it streams in only filled half of the screen height wise. Never had that problem with any other amazon stream<br /><br />Edited to 5 stars, since amazon apparently fixed the streaming issues since release. Although I am still upset about my first viewing being so awful.
B00008973A|5.0|Bought this for my fifteen year old grandaughter who is dancing to this music at school. An oldie that lives on for future generations to enjoy. We love it still.
B005LAII8K|4.0|Really liked this movie. The concept was the usual time-travel scenario done in a unique way. Definitely recommend it to sci-fi fans out there. JGL is really maturing into a fine actor.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love this series.  Also such a great price, couldn't find a better price anywhere else.  My mom loves them.
B005QUQ99K|5.0|My little nephews really love it and they are very good quality I buy this and other lego ninjago more
B000NJMJGG|5.0|I remember watching this movie as a child and was so happy to find it on DVD! My husband and I loved watching it again and shipping was very quick!
B007REV4YI|4.0|Skyfall was great and all but with the exception of Casino Royale, I can't say I've been thrilled with this new &#34;pared&#34; down version of James Bond. Sure, Some of the classic Bond movies may have been over the top but it now seems that the writers have swung completely in the other direction. This minimalist Bond seems to have more in common with Bourne Ultimatum than Octopussy. Still a great movie but lets have a little of that Bond crazy.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Saw this movie @ theater & loved it.  The only Bond movies I liked we're with Sean Connery.  None of the other Bond actors were good.  Daniel Craig plays a great Bond!  Fast service.
B00BTWCKGA|5.0|Great rock about the Rock of Ages, King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Well done concert video that sounds great.
B007N85POS|5.0|My 5-year-old grandson loves this game.  It's easy for him, and challenging for me. I'm not a big game player, but I do enjoy this!
0307895475|5.0|Skyrim is the first game I've ever really been obsessed with, but I'm a total addict now, and I knew I needed this guide to really get the most out of my Skyrim experience. Sometimes I just want to figure things out for myself, but anytime I have a question or get stuck in a quest, I pull out my trusty game guide. I like that there are checkboxes to keep track of things (for example, the 24 unusual gem locations - I needed to keep track). Haven't used the Hearthfire portions since I downloaded the Hearthfire DLC, but I'm sure I won't be disappointed. Definitely a must-have for the Skyrim afficiando.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|It's been a long wait, but this album proves some things are worth the wait. I predict that next year's Grammy's may as well be called the \\"Timberlake & Timbaland\\" show because the night will belong to them. For fans of JT from his early years, I find this album sprinkled with clever little reminders of where he's been, and where he is now.<br /><br />He opens with \\"Pusher Love Girl.\\" It's bluesy and enjoyable. I've seen the melody described as Walt Disney with a Timbaland twist. The song gives the first taste of what seems to have become a JT trademark...the fake-ending-only-to-find-out-the-song-isn't-over. The song is strong on its own, but then we're treated with the ending portion. JT and Tim have mastered the craft of wetting the listener's appetite, of essentially \\"adding dessert\\" to an already good song just to give it that extra edge. The latter part practically has JT free-styling. One song in and I was already thinking \\"Yeah, this is going to be good.\\"<br /><br />Next, \\"Suit & Tie\\" feat. Jay Z, the first single. I wasn't crazy about this track at first, but after the brilliant 'high' of \\"Pusher Love Girl\\", it sounds great. I think this song demonstrates the classic example of how sometimes you can't appreciate a piece of something without seeing (or hearing) its spot in the whole. The chop-&-screwed sections are nice twist to prevent the song from being average.<br /><br />Track 3 opens with *Nsync reminiscent harmonizing, then enters Tim and the beat \\"Dance...Don't hold the wall.\\" It's exotic & hypnotic. It's like a hybrid of \\"Slow Wind\\" (R.Kelly) and \\"Indian Flute\\" (Timbaland & Magoo)--but still uniqe. JT's smooth voice floats and creates a rhythm over the beat. Then we get to the fake-ending before dessert portion. Suddenly, the song is asking, \\"Well, how do you like it?\\" Timbaland answers for us, \\"You shouldn't have to ask me that question.\\" And he's right. 3 songs that already outshine anything on radio now. Timbaland goes on to say, \\"I love it.\\" Me too, Tim.<br /><br />Next: \\"Strawberry Bubblegum.\\" My mom mused that it sounded like Barry White at the opening with JT's sweet voice crooning in the background. Once officially started, the song is pretty and mellow. It puts me to mind of early Michael Jackson (like \\"I Can't Help It\\"). Then the beat switches. I hear something Stevie Wonder reminiscent (and it's clear JT studies the greats, yet doesn't come off as \\"copycat\\"). \\"Be my strawberry bubblegum, and I'll be your blueberry lollypop.\\" A song with lyrics like that shouldn't be good, but it is, lol. And you just can't deny it...<br /><br />JT knows you can't deny it. \\"Tunnel Vision\\" starts chanting \\"I know you like it.\\" This song reminds me of \\"Ayo Technology\\", JT's collab with 50 Cent and has a clever nods to the past. When I hear JT sing \\"a crowded room anywhere, a million people all around and all I see is you there\\", I'm reminded of *Nsync's cutesy  \\"Just the Two of Us\\" where JT sings, \\"In a room full of people, you're the only one around.\\" It's a moment that shows JT's growth. There's a break in the song, and then the beat returns with mind-blowing beat-boxing accompanied with dramatic and theatrical violins. JT's smooth vocals sing, \\"All I see is you there, everything just disappears, disappears...\\" JT makes his competition disappear, that's for sure.<br /><br />Next track-- a Timbaland ballad, reminds me of work he did with Ginuwine back when R&B was at the top of its game. JT sings \\"Hop into my spaceship coupe.\\" Again, I'm hit with another flashback with the now incredibly cheesy \\"Space Cowboy\\" where *Nsync sang, \\"Take a space ride, with the cowboy baby.\\" (Or how about the better \\"Nothin Else\\" on Justified where JT sings, \\"You're out of this world, except you're not green). JT removed the cheese and created a quirky Prince-like ballad. JT tells us to sing, \\"Oooh-whooo-whoo-whoooo.\\" I can already hear an arena of people singing along.<br /><br />Next, \\"That Girl.\\" Motown-flavored R&B. This is a nod to Smokey Robinson's style with its the jazzy smooth singing, classic R&B sound, do-wopping in the background, all mixed with classic JT & Timbaland at the speeded-up chorus (which reminds me of Aaliyah). How did JT and Timb teleport themselves back to the Motown Era and put their own stamp on it? I don't know, but they did. \\"Don't be mad at me,\\" JT sings. I'm not.<br /><br />JT said \\"Let the Groove Get In\\" was approached 'as if the Jackson 5 went to Brazil.' Yep. I can imagine a young, energetic MJ performing it. This song sounds like you are watching a parade march past that you want to join. If J5 was the inspiration, then it is young-adult MJ that's the inspiration for the 'dessert' section. JT's otherworldly falsetto starts, \\"All night long...just let the groove get in.\\" It's like he was in the studio and prayed to the spirit of Off-The-Wall-Era MJ falsetto and let it guide him.<br /><br />Now the 2nd single, \\"Mirrors.\\" It reminds me of an updated alternate universe \\"Cry Me a River.\\" The lyrics couldn't be more different though since JT is happily married now. It's just that it has a classic Timbaland & JT beat, but there's something spiritual about it. I can envision it performed with a choir. JT adds that dessert he's so fine at making, and takes the song to another level. \\"You are, you are, the love of my life\\" he chants. The chant gets engraved in your head and long after the song goes off. It's so simple, yet so pretty. JT's voice is heavenly as it soars and sings over the chant.<br /><br />\\"Blue Ocean Floor\\" closes the album. It's calming after the rollercoaster of incredible beats, beautiful falsettos, head-bopping, dance tracks. JT wants to let you catch your breath before you start the album over. I think some people will LOVE this last track and consider it the stand-out. JT himself seems to fall into this category. Others will hate it and consider it the weakest on the album. I find it incredibly beautiful and unique. It's the most poetic song of JT's career. It begs to be listened to on a different level, almost as classical music does. \\"Heartbeat set at a steady pace, I'll let the rhythm show me the way. No one can find us here, fade out and disappear.\\"<br /><br />There's nothing left to say. JT created an absolute masterpiece. I believe this guy is a legend in the making.at-boxing is reminiscent of \\"Cry Me A River\\", JT adds that dessert he's so fine at making, and takes the song to another level. \\"You are, you are, the love of my life\\" he chants. This chant gets engraved in your head and long after the song goes off, your still thinking about it and chanting and bopping your head. It is so simple, yet pretty...the chant keeps going, and JT's voice sounds absolutely heavenly as it soars over the chant.<br /><br />Now the end, \\"Blue Ocean Floor.\\" I think back to JT's past albums, and it is also a trademark to end on a mellow note. Something to calm you after a rollercoaster of incredible beats, beautiful falsettos, head-bopping, dancing...JT wants to let you catch your breath before you start the album all over again. I think some people will LOVE this last track and consider it the stand-out on the album. JT himself seems to fall into this category. Others will hate it and consider it the weakest of the album...perhaps the only song that gets skipped. I find the song incredibly beautiful, and very unique. Listening to the melody, I get the impression that it is being played backwards and JT is singing forward over it. Lyrically, this song is the most poetic (perhaps the most poetic song of his career). While the rest of the album wants to make you dance, bop your head, and sing along, this song begs to be listened to on a different level, almost in the way that classical music does.<br />\\"Heartbeat set at a steady pace, I'll let the rhythm show me the way. No one can find us here, fade out and disappear.\\"<br /><br />There's nothing left to say. Phenomenal album. An absolute masterpiece. Well done, JT. I believe this guy is a legend in the making.

0765325950|4.0|I was happy after all of the trials and tribulations of this wonderful fantasy to see the conclusion had lived up to it's predecessors.  The ending was contrived in my opinion and left me a little more troubled than satisfied.
B00AEFYCL4|4.0|It was a refreshing take on a unique individual that wanted no part in the rat race of the world that has forgotten to know what it means to live off the earth and connect with it.<br /><br />I would recommend this film to everyone.

B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Fast delivery but most important is the voice.  It is so relaxing to listening to the music.  Having a cup of tea and just enjoying the serenity of the moment.  In the car it is even better with heavy traffic.  Keeps you from stressing.

0316228532|1.0|There is no doubt Rowling spent much time and put much of herself into this book.  She is a very talented writer, and it shows in everything she writes.  Having said that...<br /><br />Like many others who have read this book, I finished it feeling many emotions, the most distinct of which was disappointment.  My disappointment is multi-faceted.  First, I'm disappointed with the superfluous complexity of the plot, mainly because most of the story lines were left hugely open-ended.  If the complexity of plot and character development had had an overall purpose, I might be more satisfied.  But alas, we only really find closure with one character.<br /><br />Second, I am disappointed with the utter lack of hope for any of the characters.  Barry Fairbrother is the happiest of all the characters, if that tells you anything.  Camus' The Plague is a bright, happy book compared to this.  At least characters in that book are able to find purpose in the midst of despair.  A Casual Vacancy is just plain nihilism with a nice red cover.<br /><br />Third, and most of all, I'm disappointed with Rowling for making such a big leap in maturity in so short a time.  I'm not easily offended, but even I, a grown adult, was taken aback by the profanity and verbal pornography.  Even so, my disappointment here has nothing to do with my own taste.  It has to do with Rowling's primary readership, which continues to be young and impressionable.  Sure, we were warned that \\"this is an adult book,\\" but I'm now convinced that this warning was not nearly publicized enough, nor was it appropriately stern.  If books could have an MPAA rating, it would be rated R at best.  If I didn't know any better, and my kids told me that the author of Harry Potter just wrote a new book and asked for it for Christmas, I might be naive enough to ignore this mild warning.  The young people who still read Harry Potter can be told a thousand times that A Casual Vacancy is \\"an adult book,\\" but what good does such a mild warning do?  Rowling has created a situation in which parents who ignore the warning and proceed to purchase the book for their children are exposing them to material that is truly inappropriate for anyone younger than 17.<br /><br />Therefore, my disappointment mainly stems from Rowling's irresponsible use of her talents, her name, and her voice.<br /><br />I understand that Rowling wanted to create a realistic portrayal of the tragedies within modern society.  I am only one of thousands who are truly saddened by both the chasm between the classes and the suffering it creates.  I'm not blind to the fact that there are many people who ignore the suffering of the lower class simply because they are too wrapped up in their petty gossip and narcissism.  Perhaps Rowling wanted simply to use her voice as a way to raise awareness of the issues she cares about, but I am baffled as to why she chose to do it in this manner under the auspices of \\"J.K. Rowling's new novel!\\"<br /><br />Ultimately, I think the one redeeming virtue of this book is that it has a title appropriate for its contents.  Rowling \\"Casually\\" published this story, and her fans \\"Causally\\" purchased it in turn.  But the real emphasis should be placed on \\"Vacancy.\\"  It is vacant of hope; vacant of morals; vacant of beauty; vacant of joy; vacant of closure.  Etc, etc.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|This would work better for me if I had a stylus, drawing with your finger can be quite a challenge.  Somewhat time consuming if you are just playing with a random person. Maybe playing with someone you know would go faster & be more fun.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Yes there is some skill so track your prizes. But fun to play as you try to complete puzzles. Granddaughter enjoys it too.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|I gave this five stars because each episode (3 so far) has left me excited for the next. Great locations, great cast and great story.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|It's not flashy nor does it have a deep, life-changing meaning.  Then again, maybe it does.  I absolutely loved this book and I bought copies for several of my dearest friends.  Highly recommended!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I am super satisfied with this app. I just do not get bored of it. try number one also plz!
1466208686|5.0|This book is absolutely wonderful! It guides you through the simple interview questions which is a must for any programmers, computer science students or computer engineers out there.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is a great show! Season 3 starts out to be very gripping. The build up towards the finale starts to get a little tedious but it's still an extremely entertaining experience. If you haven't started on this show yet, or aren't convinced on picking up season 3, you are certainly missing out.<br /><br />Very great production, shot on location in Georgia. The twists are smart and the characters are memorable. Great show.
B004UQ2C6U|1.0|wrong region, would not play in any of my dvd players, so, this is why I hate that Supernatural - Season 2
1416562605|5.0|Can't say enough about this book, buy borrow or steal it ;)also can recomend the audio book, it is well read and fun to listen to
B009BDUOG2|4.0|Like this one, Like the fact  it's got several different boxes. directions not bad! I really  like the fact I can have it on my Kindle,easy access.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun game with great graphics! I played it with my little sister and she loved it (especially on a long trip.)
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book had me hooked on every word.... the survival of people who were punished for their ancestors mistakes. A triangle of lovers, war, and a fight to live and overcome the \\"odds\\". Those who love to read book on suspense will enjoy this.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I like subway surfers better but this is good to not my favorite though  I like subway surfers much better than temple run 2 just saying but still I like it but not much I like puzzle games 2 well bye
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|Everything is perfect about this combo pack, but when I opened the packaging I noticed that the outer cardboard covering had been damaged as if someone had slightly ripped it. It is not that noticeable but it was still a let down.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|These tracks have been relares, reconfigured, replayed & re-released many times, but this guy is GREAT. Fun to listen to how some of these tracks evolved in to the classics we know and love so well, with a couple of little teasers thrown in which a new ( well maybe not brand new ) and not flogged / released to death. Jimi, always at his prime & we gotta keep Janie in diamonds, I suppose ....
0545265355|5.0|I bought these last year for my daughter who was in 8th grade. She LOVES to read. She read the first one and loved it, but only got through half the second book. She stopped reading it because she didn't like how the story was proressing. Now my son is in 8th grade this year and he is reading the whole trilogy. He loves them and he HATES to read. That makes me a happy momma!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love this App for Ebay!!! It makes it very easy to keep track of my bids and sells on the go. Very well designed lay out. Wouldn't be as easy without it. Must have for all Ebay user's.
B00AUU2KI0|4.0|Like It but not from this seller.  I thought the condition was going to be better.  Feel kind of deceived as it was categorized as in good condition.  But the binding is loosening - the pages are starting to fall out.<br />The story is great.  I wanted to get the older edition without the movie version influence on the cover.<br />i hope there will be another original story from Martel soon, not just a one good book novelist.
B004UHF51S|5.0|How can you fault Michael's output. This man has been recording for forty years and you would have to search a LONG WAY to find any bad tracks in his cannon. I am so happy to hear this new disc, but it makes you want more & more. Keep 'em coming, Michael. This is a disc that, if you're a Mr Franks fan, you can not miss & a pleasant disc for people who aren't devotees, it's a great place to start. Listen to how radio friendly jazz SHOULD be played right here.
1452110581|5.0|This book is hilarious!  Anyone who has a cat will appreciate the humor. I plan on buying several copies for all my cat-loving friends, especially since the book is a great - and reasonably-priced - gift item.  The title alone is worth the $10.33!  If you are like me, you will be thinking:  \\"Now why didn't I write this book?\\"  But I didn't, and the guy who did deserves all the credit for this very funny, very clever book.  Can't wait for Volume II:  \\"I Did Pee On This..and That...and That Over There.\\"
B009KEN87O|5.0|awesome retro, can't believe it's faotd, and thank you amazon for that.  Play was good up to a point for me, at some point it becomes hard, as it should, but I'm done with that, still awesome game.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I had no intentions of buying Justin Timberlake's new album because I wasn't a Justin Timberlake fan...UNTIL NOW! This album is what you need in your life. I heard about it via Twitter and so I sampled the songs and I was like ok, ok. I see you Justin. Went to Target because they have the deluxe edition and let me tell you that was the best purchase I could've made in music. I hope he gets at least 10 grammys for this one. This album carries a smooth, sexy sound that you can groove to from beginning to end.<br /><br />My Fav tracks are:<br /><br />Pusher Lover Girl<br />Don't Hold The Wall (Ultimate Fav)<br />Strawberry Bubblegum<br />Let The Groove Get In<br />Mirrors<br />Blue Ocean Floor<br /><br />I love how he did something different that no one else is doing and that's extending the songs. Basically combining the original with the remix to those tracks that are 7-8 min long. His voice is so intoxicating that you can't help but love whatever he does with it. So overall, if this is what comes from going on a 7 year hiatus...I'll wait! Music at its finest!!!
B008I3RARW|5.0|This game was worth downloading. It was fun and allowed you to feel like your behind the wheel....ok to a point anyway...lol. So don't miss out on this game and check it out!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|omg I love this game. I saw my friend playing this game and when I downloaded this game I became addicted. get this game I recommend it to all.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Remimds me of Galaga with some new twists. Fun game for my hubby ad me to reminisce over, easy enough to be fun for our little one too. I'm actually playing it on his Nabi!
B00ARAO720|4.0|trying to kill some time? good movie to do that, it was very exciting and thrilling, id watch it again
B009NXV2RK|4.0|Easy to read, full of action and mirroring current events regarding China's cyber capabilities nicely. Hope to see the main Characters return again sometime soon.
B001H5X7I4|5.0|Very fast and very easy! My movie was in great shape and I will absolutely be using this source again!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this game is awesome and good for all ages who can read if your looking to get this game take it from me and play me my User name is 2003lexi
B002CM03PQ|5.0|This was so outstanding. I lived in those days, and my husband and I came so close to going. Only reason we didn't was two very young children. I bought two copies all together. The person I sent it two also loved it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Fantastic book for everyone especially dog lovers, I'm in tears right now and you will be too after reading this
B00AESN8XY|5.0|My grandson enjoys this game very much. When he is happy so am I. we recommend this game to those of the appropriate age to play it.
B0045XGRQE|5.0|If you want to watch this movie, I recommend watching all of the individual Avenger ( Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America) movies and the sequels in order in which they were made. That will really set the story and tie them all in. Make sure you either watch the credits or fast forward through them at the end because there is more to the movies.<br />I really wasn't a Robert Downey, Jr. fan before but he is great and really fits the role. Everybody would like to be Tony Stark also let alone Iron Man.
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|The price is very reasonable.  I used with a bunch of teenagers and it was surprisingly resilient, but sound is not that great and it isn't very strong.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a good game it really helps me understand ways of life and awesome stuff :) I love this game
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great game for the ages of two and up. helps the younger ones with their motor skills and their perception. The older children enjoy it for the challenge of moving up the levels.
B003ELMR9E|5.0|Pacino, what can I say. That is a review that speaks for itself. Different role for Robin Williams but it is just a tribute to his ability as a great actor.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|This is an excellent match three puzzle game that plays similar to Puzzle Quest. My only complaint is the occassional pop-up ad that will cover the playing field to get an inadvertant click during feverish clicking.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is way better than the first version. I would recommend this to everyone. They should definitely make third temple run.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a great tool to collect all of your ideas and preferred visited websites, all in one place.  Someone told me about Pinterest, I tried it and I'm in love with it!  I use it now daily.  100% recommend it!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Easy to learn.  So much like Invaders. I am glad it was a free app of the day, but it would be worth paying for.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|Do not rent the streaming version.  I just did and haven't finished the movie so can't comment on the film. But, the screen is tiny (yes I know it's widescreen, its even smaller than that) and its only in stereo sound. Awful amazon, shame on you.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Received my DVD on time in great condition.Very pleased.I watch so many times and still is like I just saw for the first time.<br />Great piece of British classics.<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />mpj
B002UBRFDC|5.0|Alway entertaining, I read it at least once a year and always go away with something new. it is like being there
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Very nicely done. Great graphics, great physics integration, good soundtrack. Try the free demo, the paid version is more of the same.
0553382152|5.0|This was a very inspiring and comforting book.  I recently lost my wife to cancer and was overwhelmed with grief.  As I read Embraced by the Light I was reminded of God's eternal gift.  Her vivid presentation of what awaits us helped me realize I will be with my wife when my jouney here is complete and God calls me home.
B000784WMW|5.0|Received my DVD on time. Timothy Dalton should had another actress partner in this movie but I was not the director.He is high more above her performance.<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />mpj
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Really enjoy this game.  I love that there are special dragons.  They cost gems but you can also breed them and save the gems for other items.  Best game like this that I have played
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|GOOD game it just took me a little getting used to but I like it I would recommend that I get if you like racing games and I am a girl so if I liked it you will.
0060899220|5.0|Entertaining to service industry people and non restaurant people alike. Basically a mini-biography of Bourdain's life, and a look into the world of the kitchens who serve your food.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|Cast very much in the light of &#34;X-Files&#34; and &#34;Fringe,&#34; the Doctor Who spinoff &#34;Torchwood&#34; (an anagram of &#34;Doctor Who&#34;) follows the adventures of a shadowy team assigned to investigate and, if necessary, prosecute alien interference in current-day England.  From a secret base in London the group deals, in Series 1, with everything from deadly wood sprites to an alien sexual predator.  As might be inferred from those examples, &#34;Torchwood,&#34; especially in Series 1, deals regularly with adult themes and is most certainly not for children, but for the young at heart.<br /><br />Although &#34;Torchwood&#34; was introduced through the Doctor Who show, where the lead character, Captain Jack Harkness, was seen in several cameo appearances, this show is not a mere recast of its venerable predecessor.  Rather, Torchwood presents stories from a world in which the Gallifreyan might as easily be perceived as an enemy as an ally, were he to appear, which he does not.  Torchwood will appeal to many fans of Doctor Who, but that's definitely not a prerequisite.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Nelson DeMille rarely disappoints. His books are hard to put down, and this is no exception. word word word word
B00BCOGM78|5.0|Nothing ground-breaking here, just a return to the Blast Tyrant-ish Clutch sound that's been missing on the last few releases. I personally wasn't a huge fan of the blues influence heavy sounds of Strange Cousins or Beale Street, but really enjoyed the heavier Blast Tyrant and Robot Hive. This record is definitely more in that vein - lots of uptempo, heavy grooves here.<br /><br />Earth Rocker is Clutch at their best: no frills, straight ahead rock - it's excellent.
B003FSTN5C|5.0|I may be biased on this one but I like the show.  I find the characters believable and entertaining as they are in the original NCIS program.  It also helps that the main characters work together and come back season to season.
0812993357|5.0|Grace Coddington may not be a writer by trade, but with a little help from Michael Roberts, any number of intriguing (and fun!) snapshots, photographs, and magazine spreads, and a smattering of her deliciously naive sketches, she has made Grace: A Memoir into an entertaining (albeit admittedly fashion-centric), if not tell-all, at least a tell-some, first person glimpse into behind-the-scenes at Vogue magazine. I love the juicy, gossipy details of the shoots for Vogue layouts I have seen and find fascinating those I haven't - her descriptions really make me want to go look up each and every issue.<br />Ms. Coddington gives up details and tells tales on herself as much as on anyone else, and  definitely seems more real, relatable, and down to earth to me after reading her memoir.
B00633W614|5.0|Part of a family saga, well written, unexpected twists and turns in each volume. First in a series with, couldn't put down.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Sounds weird, but it's great!<br /><br />Give it a chance.  I would watch it again and recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />!!!
B001E75QH0|5.0|another gift for my daughter, who has wanted this collection for some time - she's very happy with it. Yes
B004W2V254|4.0|Having watched several films based on mountain climbing, I always find them fascinating and the cinematography here is absolutely terrific.  Subtitled, but no big deal.  A good watch for anyone, young or old.
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|this book contains lots of references to recent Swedish politics; this detracts from the story line big time, without contributing to it.
B0035LGXXO|4.0|Will always be a classic in my book. I'll be forty years old next month and still want to be a &#34;Warrior&#34;.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I got this for my daughter's 26th birthday, as it was on her wish list.<br />She's very happy with it
0316098515|5.0|Great cook book.  Lots of good easy & simple recipes.  I would recommend it to everyone that likes to cook.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|The first part of the book about his life is an interesting tale on its own. His description of the Carrie like girls he went to high school with was very interesting. I never knew there was a time when kids wore the same clothes to school everyday. I don't know why that tidbit really stuck with me. It was also reassuring to know that he had a spike in his bedroom with rejection letters. The second part of the part was helpful to me as a new writer. I learned how to go about getting an agent and how the business works. I also picked up some tips to make my writing better. The end of the book told about the van accident and his recovery. The entire book was either helpful to me personal or entertaining as a reader.
B009KEN87O|5.0|great time killer.  I would recommend this to anybody that wants the retro of space invaders with a new kick.  Go Old School!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game a good way to kill time. The only thing I don't like is the pop-up ads for other games.
B007REV4YI|5.0|A great combination of today's technology with homage to some of the original Bond films.  Something for the new fans and something for the fans of the early films too!!!
B009GED3HS|5.0|We purchased a couple episodes to catch up this season.  Watched it via PS3 and the quality was great!  No issues with lagging.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I downloaded this app for free on Christmas Day.  It was fun and exciting and there was so much to do.  Then reality hit.  After two months of not spending money nor being able to get any \\"friends\\" to gift, I had to give up.  The game hit level 60 and would go no higher so I could clear up the shadows more.<br /><br />Without sinking hundreds of dollars there is no way to get ponies after a certain point.  I hit that point.  Then there are the gemstone converter things that once you activated it, you could exchange your gemstones for coins.  That worked great...until the last of the 6.  It requires 150 gemstones to activate it and you might get one stone in a week IF your lucky.<br /><br />There is no way to get hearts to get more ponies unless you have \\"friends\\" on Facebook or other.  MAJOR disappointment.<br /><br />I say don't waste your time.  Sorry.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|Highly recommend this CD and this group! Liked the group befor buying the CD. Love the CD. It  We play it nearly every day!
B005DN5BE4|5.0|It is about a cause worth fighting for -- FREEDOM from slavery. -- which took us to the Civil War.
B000YHG72E|5.0|As a fan of Will Ferrell, I almost enjoy his movies  This is a classic that everyone should enjoy and purchase.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Slow at first.... and touching at the end.<br />Simple and easy read novel.<br />Makes you think about what matters in life.<br />Delivers a meaningful  message...
B000002GW5|5.0|This has been a great addition to my musical library! I would recommend it to any Jackson Brown fan or new listener alike.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I love the color! I also love the feature of putting my Kindle to sleep when I close the cover. Wish there was a place in the cover where I can put my stylus. Still a nice case for the price!
0316017930|4.0|Outlier by Malcolm Gladwell was an intellectually stimulating read with a ripe knack for creativity. As an overall assessment of cultural phenomena, ranging from the wild success of Bill Gates, to the gripping and at times harsh reality of childhood education, Gladwell does a great job of presenting the information without sounding repetitive. While some of Gladwell's arguments become a bit exhausted towards the closing chapters of the novel, time and time again I found myself  having to  ask \\"what if? \\" or \\"why\\"<br /><br />One of the more though provoking chapters analyzed the discrepancy in Asian in comparison to American education. Gladwell presents the argument that the primary obstacle in mending the gap would require American schools transition into the year round system deployed by schools of the east. Furthermore, on matters of education, Gladwell debunks the myth that education is not so much an innate ability than it is cultural nature.  How do you assess success? Is it relative? Is it innate?  According to Outliers, success revolves around the individual's ability to practice with persistence, an in addition, practice at a level explicitly higher than their peers. For the aspiring entrepreneur, athlete, or even student, Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell is a highly insightful read that has the potential to alter your perspective of the world forever.
0634022296|4.0|There is a lot of information in this book and it is (large) paperback size.  The author simplifies the chords for easier playing but explains this up front so there is no misconception.  t is very concise and it works well.  The binding doesn't lend itself to being laid out open -- I use clips (e.g., a capo) or heavy things to keep it open.  Most songs don't require any page turning which helps.  Some songs I prefer the barre chords for some parts and the movement between chords, but for a simplified chord songbook this is pretty good.
0345529057|5.0|I got these books as an anniversary present from my husband after I started watching the HBO television show Game of Thrones.  It is very interesting to read the books and see where the show diverged from the original story.  These changes become more prevalent in the second book and onwards.  I highly reccomend these books for those who enjoy GAME OF THRONES on HBO.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|WOW-WOW-WEE-WOW!! I don't know what else to say about this book. It was very detailed and I appreciate that. I read this in 36 hours and couldn't wait to read the second book!
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|An engaging read that really makes you think... Picoult makes the characters so sincere and the situations so tangible that the whole heart-wrenching story becomes real!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Could not put it down!  Sad, touching, overwhelming.  I hope the rest of the movies give the book justice like the first one did.
140053271X|4.0|I love reading, and in a lot of cases I found myself leaving a book at home because I didn't want to carry any heavy things. This is great! I put in a small 512MB card and now it holds ~50 books! I gave it 4 stars only because the dictionary function isn't very good. I think it has a literal copy of a dictionary, which means it doesn't explain the word fully but still doesn't allow you to search for the meaning of a work in the translation window...
B0064MPXFA|5.0|What can I say, the whole country loves it. It is  superbly written, outstandingly produced,magnificently directed,and presents an imposing  cast who exceed ones expectations in stellar fashion. All that, and it integrates  a timely, and compelling account to relate each week. Rave! Rave! Rave! Six stars out of five. Frightfully sorry that I missed the first two years.
B005OK722U|1.0|Pardon me as I digress but I wish to make clear why this budget\\"made for video\\" movie is really BAD! It has been sanitized to a degree similar to the hack job on Ed Gein (1957 body snatcher) that grade school kids could watch, if they could stay awake. We owned a typically small grocery store (20'x20' typical 40-50's) when Ed was grinding up his supply of meat and making lamp shades and furniture out or skin and the real chill was so bad we could not sell ground meat without proof we bought it from a SAFE vender and still sales lagged for several years. As a rule I never watch ghoulish videos except for Friday the 13-I and Halloween and like those I watched \\"Hostile I\\" as a curious fluke. My skin actually crawled from what I saw. \\"Hostel I\\" actually had a very good ghoulish story and number II was so-so ok, but this video had no real story, no scary moments and its tortures lacked skin crawl and blocked all scenes (like in Ed Gein) that would be offensive and God forbid create little Columbines.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking dead they are... but there is a story with this show and that makes it exciting and full of suspense. Great Show!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I think this is a great app. It does everything I need it to, without any problems. It is a solid app, and works great with the kindle fire hd.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Very interesting and moving story.  Serves to illustrate the absurdity of war and the risks young men had to take in the sky.  Nice overview of our Greatest Generation and a fine tribute to them and a gallant foe.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love the hunger games!!!!!! ❤  when I finished the book, I started crying!!!! I plan on reading this series again and I'll encourage all of my family and friends to read it whoever they get the chance... ( meaning whenever they have a couple ours to spare for reading because that's what you need if you read a book as good as this!) Thank you , Suzanne Collins, for writing such a good book. I look up to Katniss, I just hope that I get the chance to read these books again!!!!!!!

B0094K20FK|5.0|I think This was one of the best movies.  It is my understanding that the new StarTrek movie coming out is somewhat based on this one, this is why I wanted to re watch it.

B008GVD6D8|5.0|OMG this was the only thing I could say when I finished it. I pulled an all nighter, Day kept me wanting more and more. The difference between this one and the first is huge,but definitely much more intense. I couldn't believe what my eyes were reading, I am so glad Day pulled away from James because she did a much better job. This book is amazing, just absolutely perfect.<br />There wasn't one thing in the book I didn't like, she surprised me with the final, I knew he could pull out something like that but I didn't believe the author would make him do that. The situation is going to put a big restrain on their relationship, this is the most complete and true prove of love, but it's going to complicate this a lot.<br />The characters grew immensely, they are more complex if that's even possible. Gideon and Eva are a breath of fresh air, I say this because I thought Day would do the same thing James did,the marriage. But I loved the all getting closer, him fighting is nature when the all thing with Bret happened, he was pissed no doubt about it but he roused to the situation and reached what he was searching from the beginning the truth from her, and didn't explode with her, blaming her for what happened.<br />What can I say... I cant wait to read the third one,I want to know how will she deal with the fact that he k****d Nathan, I am sure that's not that easy for her to bare like she assumed to be in the end of the book. The guilt will consume Gideon, I know and we all know why he did it, but I think we will reach a point of blaming her for what he did for her, I hope not, but that would be a fairy tale and I don't think Day follows that path. Well I didn'think she would reach that final, I thought she would reveal his secret, make Nathan appear of course, but she would save for the third book a development like that.<br />I cant say I approve what he did, I know he loves her and would move heavens and earth for her but even so that was a very bold move, Day surprised me.<br />I don't think I can wait much longer for the third :)<br />5 STARS FOR DAY JUST PERFECTy surprised me.<br />I don´t think I can wait much longer for the third :)<br />5 STARS FOR DAY JUST PERFECT
B005LAIIKI|2.0|Half Spagetti-Western, half Blaxploitation. Zero realism. With that in mind you may be able to take this movie \\"seriously\\".  But parts of it still have all the intrigue of Tarantino's painfully memorable bomb \\"Dusk Till Dawn\\", the endless vampire killing spree film with all the intrigue of a bad video game.  Django ends in similar fashion - utterly predictable and a brainless bore.  Whatever.  There were a lot of bad Spaghettis and Blaxploitations as well, let's not forget.  With this movie Quenton doesn't let us.  Not only that he adds another to the genres, minus the genuine retro charm of the originals.<br /><br />I give it 2 stars for the rather interesting first half of the movie.  Until it reached the last half hour I was ready to give it 4 stars.  But excuse me, Samuel Jackson as head butler of a slave plantation?  Breathing in DiCaprio's ear every two seconds at dinner and sounding a lot more like Sanford (of Sanford and Son) than anything representing a realistic portrayal of the era.  Oh yeah, I forgot: realism not on the menu!  But once the movie degenerated into the \\"Dusk Till Dawn\\" video game massacre (that we've already seen how many billion times in Hollywood movies?), I didn't care.  Tarantino uses brawn when he can't come up with brains, and I think it's just a cop-out to always hide behind the formula of retro-wanna-be movies.
B00004YTXH|1.0|The mission sound track is only 2 songs . The musical arrangement was not the long updated one you hear from his live concert that you get to expect when you listen to the cd version.

B000007NYS|5.0|Shipping and handling were all accomplished on time and as promised. The CD itself is so great to have back in my collection. I lost my original copy two years ago and have been hoping it would reapear in its' empty case, to no avail. The good news is that the new CD include six additional tracks not found on the original and also includes liner notes with lyrics and great photos of Lucinda and the band. My ex- girlfriend did not appreciate how great Lucinda is, so I always turn up the volume a few decibles extra in her honor, especially on &#34;Changed The Locks&#34;. It's better than Counseling and Prozak when I need to adjust my attitude!!!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|The best note-keeping app I have found so far! It has everything you need from voice notes, typed notes and photo notes. I absolutely love this app!

B005CRQ3NY|5.0|Great and really funny, not quite like the movie but very entertaining. Pictures and comics come to life in this book, great for all kids who want a little fun in their reading! Great Book!!!!!! 5 Stars!
B003UESJHY|2.0|I just watched this - comes off like a made-for-TV movie.  The fight scenes are sometimes embarrassingly bad with them just gingerly waving their arms.  Acting leaves much to be desired as well.  It has no Rocky heart/charm/intensity.  I never felt connected to any of the characters.  Then again I don't really want to see a movie about crack addicts and how they bring people down.  The movie should have been called 'Crack', not The Fighter.  Maybe watch sometime when it's on TV, but if you don't, you aren't missing much anyway.

B00BRUYNBE|4.0|Great to see this talented group release an album with fantastic new material!<br /><br />Recommended feel-good music all the way 'round!
B00005AREQ|5.0|Unquestionably Jeff Beck is one of the most amazing guitar virtuosos of the century, and the platinum \\"Blow By Blow\\" is a truly stunning body of work. Beck's playing is above reproach and is perhaps at its most distinctive here, with elements from rock, jazz, and especially funk coloring the musical palette. Although the material does strongly evoke the 1970s (it was released in 1975) and has a retro-funk vibe on many of the tracks (especially \\"Thelonius\\" and \\"Air Blower\\") it is still enjoyable today and features astonishingly impeccable musicianship. While my favorite track is \\"Constipated Duck,\\" there's not a loser in the set.<br /><br />Fans of instrumental guitar will revel in this album. I learned to play the guitar (modestly) years ago, and after an absence of a decade or so I returned to the instrument recently taking formal lessons. One of my first assignments from my teacher was to buy \\"Blow By Blow,\\" to listen to it, and to think about it: it's been a touchstone of conversation for the two of us ever since, and I am grateful for the recommendation. Beck shines here, and this is clearly one of the best instrumental guitar albums of the 70s.

B001NLKXK2|4.0|I read this book because I wanted to try to get a glimpse into the mind of someone with dementia. In particular, I wanted to understand how it might feel to go through the different stages.<br /><br />I have a mother with dementia. I wanted to understand what she might be feeling, what she might be going through. Although I know that no two cases of dementia are the same, this book nevertheless opened my eyes and helped me better to understand and care for my mother.<br /><br />“Still Alice” was a heartbreaking novel. The author is a master story teller and overall, the book was riveting. I was glued to the pages and finished it in less than a day and a half.  I’ve recommended it to many friends who have come back to me and thanked me for letting them know about this book.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Great charging and carrying option. I charge it up and store it in my briefcase, ready to go. Highly recommended.

B007ZI06FE|4.0|Honoria and Blade's story is unique especially when their backgrounds are put in the mix. Bec did a good job creating a story with twist and turns that all tie together. Not a lot of steampunk involved but definitely mentioned. I'm looking forward to reading about Will and Lena. I hope this next book also gives us more of Leo and Charlie. Two side characters that have this book more depth.

Went out and watched the movie the week after I read the book. The movie is different than the book, so even if you have seen the movie I still recommend you read this book as well.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Great movie, got this for my boy friend for valentine's Day.  In my opinion, it was the best Men in Black film.  Delivered in a timly manner.  Throughly enjoyed this movie.
0716703440|3.0|I found this text basically a good compendium of gravitational physics, relativity and astrophysics, But find his descriptive approach a bit difficult to follow at times. It almost seems as if he is more interested in impressing the reader with his knowledge and skill as a writer than in teach or communicating knowledge. It is usable as a text for advanced physics course, but might require &#34;translation&#34; in class to decode the &#34;eloquently&#34; presented examples.

B002KKCVQE|5.0|The Teva \\"Tanza\\" sport sandal is attractive looking, and, equally comfortable and durable. It can be used for water related activites, and, it's an excellent & comfortable sandal for walking in. I consider it to be casually formal. Shipment from Amazon was quick. Along with the Amazon discount price, can't be it in the price range for this type of sport sandal, as compared to another brand besides TEVA.  Note that the TANZA has two different options in strap material. The water resistant one was my choice, as it can be washed without damaging the strap material. Go 4 it!
0446547654|5.0|I bought this book because my wife loves Nicholas Sparks novels and we are in the process of getting the whole collection in hardcover. She, as always, loves the book and I often overhear her suggesting it to friends and relatives. Happy wife, Happy life!

B002RI9ZPY|5.0|As with the other two Stieg Larsson thrillers I could not put this one down as it weaves a web of intrigue.  Stieg Larsson was an outstanding writer and it is tragic that he died before he could write anymore
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the 5 part series and couldn't stop once I began it.  Great attention to detail and character development, quick paced, and oh so many suspenseful parts.  Each chapter and section leaving the reader with a cliff hanger or a what next moment.  I found myself easily immersed in this story and will wait impatiently for more titles in the saga not to mention the potential for a movie.  I was referred to this series from a friend and what a great find!  I look forward to exploring Mr. Howley's other works.  Thank you.

B00BCOGM78|5.0|Earth Rocker is a cohesive, focused release from Maryland based Clutch.  For a band that has been together as long as Clutch has, it'd be easy to imagine them sticking to a safe formula, going with tried and true tactics that have served them well in the past.  That is not the case with Earth Rockers.  While many veteran bands tend to drift into mid-tempo songs designed to be radio-friendly, Clutch has chosen to release an aggressive set of driving rock and roll.  While there are quieter numbers, such as the stately and elegantly produced &#34;Gone Cold&#34;, the record is dominated by testosterone laden tracks such as the title track and the ripping &#34;Crucial Velocity&#34;.<br /><br />The production is crisp and allows each instrument to breathe in the mix and the double tracking of the guitars is well orchestrated as well as the vocal effects being subtle and tailored to each song.<br /><br />This is a must add to the catalog of rock and roll fans that enjoy heavily riffed stoner rock.
B006UUK612|5.0|A good sci ti movie of time travel.  A little kid loses 8 years of his recommend to all ages.
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|Compiling a retrospective of this magnitude had to be daunting. Duane Allman's career was cut short, and he was only twenty four when he died in 1971, but his legacy is remarkable. He played on hundreds of recordings as an in-house session guitarist, and the Allman Brothers taped most of their shows, so we have seen a great many archival recordings over the years. Top notch production is needed for a project like this, and we have two at the helm. Bill Levenson is a Grammy winning compilation specialist responsible for the fortieth anniversary \\"Layla\\" sessions and the Millenium collection, among many others. The participation of Galladrielle Allman, Duane's only child, makes this a familial labor of love you won't find in many compilations.<br /><br />Galladrelle was only two years old when Duane's motorcycle collided with a truck on Oct. 29, 1971. Her work on this retrospective is amazing when you consider the years spent talking to those who knew Duane, searching the music and photos, all in an attempt to \\"bring my father into sharper focus\\". She opens her essay by stating \\"every child who has ever lost a parent knows the same burning curiosity I feel\\". That's setting the bar high. Galladrille is a fine writer, and she brings to light things about Duane that might not be common knowledge to all of his fans, such as his frustration with Muscle Shoals studios.<br /><br />There are some previously unreleased gems here, including the first sides Duane and Gregg ever cut as the Escorts. What's of special interest on these tracks is Duane's unconventional playing. On \\"Turn On Your Love Light\\", Duane plays the traditional horn parts effectively while his little brother belts out the tune. Not bad for a couple of teenagers. On \\"No Name Instrumental\\", Duane concentrates on chords, sounding a bit like Link Wray.<br /><br />The Allman Joys tracks were once released in the early 70's as \\"Early Allman\\", and two of the tracks here are available on the Allman Brothers' \\"Dreams\\"box set. The Yardbirds were a big influence on the young Allmans, and their rendition of \\"Shapes of Things\\" is commendable. Here we have two never before issued tracks where the brothers do the Yardbirds proud- \\"Mister, You're A Better Man Then I\\" and \\"Lost Woman\\" show that Duane could already hold his own with Jeff Beck while developing his own style. As a curious aside, I think \\"Lost Woman\\" is the only recording available where Gregg plays harmonica.<br /><br />The Allman Brothers and the Grateful Dead shared the same fan base, so Duane fit right in with the Dead at Fillmore East playing \\"Sugar  Magnolia\\" from \\"American Beauty\\". It's often said that Duane brought out the best in his fellow musicians, and Jerry Garcia soars with him on an extended lead break. I'm curious as to why this track has never been released before, as well as the three tracks with Delaney and Bonnie that are offered here for the first time.<br /><br />I've read where some listeners take issue with the booklet, but I think it is very well put together. Along with Galladrielle's lovely essay, Scott Schinder of Rolling Stone and \\"Icons of Rock\\" wrote a brief but thorough overview of Duane's career. Quite a few of the photos included have never been seen before, and the session chronology is complete and detailed. The dates and personnel for these recordings also show just how many great artists Duane worked with over such a short time.<br /><br />Some may feel that most of these songs are already available, and true Allman fans will have most of the music here. Well, I have, or have at one time had all the Allman Brothers available including \\"Anthology\\" 1 and 2, and the \\"Dreams\\" set. I always thought I knew all of Duane's work but I was not aware of the tracks by Willie Walker, the Lovelles, the Bleus or Spencer Wiggins. Please keep in mind that a lot of these tracks were 45's and can't be found anywhere, at least not easily. I think this retrospective is one of the best ever put together- andworth every penny.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|im a big jeremy rennet fan and he done this part justice. sure hope they make more with him in it.
0545265355|5.0|I loved these books!  They were very well written and kept me in suspense the entire time I read them.  I can't wait to get the movies!

B005HP2JAM|3.0|Seems there wasn't quite enough material for a feature-length movie, so he really had to work to stretch it out.  Some parts worthwhile though because they're visually compelling.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|A great hero and a great heroine, not to mention a great story!<br /><br />There is not one part of this book you will want to skim or think is slow.  Rather you will hate to see it end.  This is not your cliché hero or heroine, both are damaged and in their way difficult.  The story of how and why is interwoven so skillfully you are totally fascinated.<br /><br />It is not a light frothy read, but a great story with characters you will love.  Be prepared for a tear in your eye at times and definitely a smile on your face at others.<br /><br />A really good read!<br />5 stars....absolutely.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|To the best of my recollection, this is a perfect rendition of the movie.  If there are any scenes missing, i did not spot them.  The classic story still delights the latest generation.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the continuation of this scintilating tale of darkness and light. Ana and Christian exploring new boundaries and learning about one another was very captivating.

B00BMCLCG6|2.0|With Jon and the boys in their 50s, it's foolish to expect the second coming of &#34;Slippery When Wet&#34; or &#34;New Jersey&#34; with any new release.  You would expect something something remotely closer to &#34;Crush&#34; or even &#34;Bounce&#34; (the last decent albums these guys have released).  It would be taking the high road in a comical way to say that this is just the band evolving with these latest offerings. The bigger question is &#34;evolving into what&#34;?! The band is still solid save for Jon's voice.  There is no question that with decent material this band could still relive the glory days of the 80s.  Sadly, the only thing we have are really bad cliches strung together in the worst possible ways.  Again, this band can bring it, Jon as a vocalist has seen better days.  Jon and company are at the point where they need to look elsewhere for better material.  Long story short, simply insert the word &#34;Retirement&#34; before this album title.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|E L James portrayal of Ana and Christian were so well written, I felt like I was right in the story.

B007EECSFA|4.0|I always enjoy reading her books, although I find them difficult to get started. They don't grab me right away,  but eventually, I get drawn in. This one, The Secret Keeper, was such a pleasant surprise and not at all what I expected!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was not just about OBL.  That was a good thing.  I don't condone the SEALS speaking out about current ops, and would not of appreciated this author if he did, (not to mention compromising the teams) but it turned out to be a very enlightening read and did not speak of current ops..  I was very close to DELTA in past, and found this book bringing me back to the good old days in a renewed way.<br />I hope Mark gets stays in the writting game and brings us more!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Thanks Mark
B005D9MUWY|5.0|The default keyboard on the Galaxy Note 2 is pretty good. This is even better. It should definitely be the default keyboard for android.

B0083ZRAJS|1.0|I haven't read this but who doesn't love the wizdard of Oz. I've grown up watching this movie from a small child. I just wanted to read the book to compare but I have so many other books I've started that I have to finish first and then move on.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I loved the book and enjoyed it from cover to cover.  I really thought it was great when I looked at where I was in the book when the real action started and noticed it was 50%.  Usually it's at the 80%, but this was a good sign to me being at 50%.  I recommend this book to all the readers that enjoy action and espionage.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|CD is a bit more upbeat that other CDs of his.  I do like many of the songs almost as much as other CDs of his.

B002UZXJA6|5.0|I first heard them on public TV and fell in love. They are so gracious, beautiful an sing like angels. My husband and I got to see them in concert in Norfolk, VA and it was wonderful. If you like this type of music you'll love Celtic Women. My husband is so wonderful, he also took me to Ireland last October and I fell in love with everything about it. Well the driving on the wrong side of the road takes a bit of getting use to but the people are soooooo nice. Love Americans, the leaves were changing but the landscape was green and flowers were blooming. The seafood is to die for. I honestly think that if I wanted to move to another country just for say 2 years to experience the life there it would be Ireland. Anyone that has an opportunity to go, please do so-you won't be disappointed. We also lost our Ipad and thought it was gone for good. The day after we got home the rental car company called to ask if we were missing anything and sent it right back to us, and never even looked inside. That's now nice they really are.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It's not often that a book makes me cry. A movie site because it's all happening in front of you. A book...never. how's have time to warm up to the characters and even predict the outcomes. John Greene is almost as unpredictable as Augustus is charming or Van Houten is a jerk. This book is a recipe for water works and personal attachment that leaves me resonating with the characters and asking myself which fate would be better. So I hate you John Greene for making me cry but I love you with more intensity for showing me such a grounded and true love story.
B0096BIENY|5.0|Excellent CD with a variety of songs.  Enjoy listening as often as I am driving in the car, short or long trips.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Excellent FAOTD! Takes you back to galaga and space invaders. Good challenging app! The only annoying thing is that they beg you to rate, but that's understandable.
B00B99KJR0|2.0|I tried to install this but I could not.  It gave me an error message each time. I expected more than this and I see other people are having the same problem.  Will you let me know if you get this fixed? If not how do I get rid of it.
0385347774|3.0|I was really into this book, until the end.  Great character development and plot.  But the ending lacked substance.  Looking forward to the movie!
B008I43DYU|3.0|Sometimes there is a delay between pushing a button and it appearing on the screen. The delete function does not always work for me (trying to remove an erronious number) and I have experienced times where the memory doesn't clear even when I push clear 3-4 times, resulting in bad calculations. I wouldn't let my students at school use it, because they might not catch that the answer is wrong.

0230749615|5.0|My 22-month old has been in love with the movie since Christmas, so I thought it would be great to purchase the book . I am so glad they had a &#34;board book&#34; version since my son has me read the book to him at least 4 times a day and would rather have me read it then watch the movie. Excellent storyline and graphics in the book. Definitely a fun read.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved the movie. I loved the book. It's pure magic. Totally recommend it. If you haven't seen the movie yet make sure you do.
B007MCTTHY|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game. Some levels only have one possible solution. Others I have been able to go back and find a second solution too. I also enjoy the graphics - even when I make a mistake. I do wish that when I don't successfully complete the level that I had more than three seconds to see where the &#34;potion&#34; went so that I could understand better where I went wrong. Sometimes I have to let them run 3-4 times before I understand why I didn't pass the level. Also, sometimes the pipe pieces will not trade places like they should and I have to go back to the menu and then return to the level I was on and start over.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love this book. I would recommend this book to. Everyone to read.I hope the movie I s going to be great to.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My nine yr old grandsons introduced it to me.  They said it was addictive.  They were right!  Tried to finish before them but they were smarter
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|As always Clutch knows how to deliver a fantastic album with insane lyrics, tight guitars, and booming drums. This is the fastest paced Clutch album since \\"Blast Tyrant\\", yet somehow the band figured out a way to encompass their sounds from \\"Beale Street\\" and \\"Strange Cousins\\" into a massive mountain of tone. \\"Earth Rocker\\" will be one of the best rock albums of 2013 and can not be missed!
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game looks like it was once on an arcade! I love the pixelated graphics, 80s video game music, and easy objective. Most games now are too difficult and complicated to be fun but this game goes back to a simpler time that proves you don't have to be fancy to be entertaining. One of the cooler FAOTD! Thanks!
B005HJU7HA|3.0|Watson would be highly disappointed that his works were so poorly translated. But, considering it was either free or didn't cost very much...I can suffer through the misspellings and the typos.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|If you are buying the 4th season of this show you probably don't really need a review.....but here goes. Best show on TV in my opionion and this is one of the better seasons.
B00APKIN1I|5.0|Buy, Listen, Enjoy!<br />Only a Collaboration this epic would get me to actually buy the CD so I can listen in the car.
6305781427|5.0|I was a teenager when I first saw this concert. I always wanted to have it. I watched it almost daily. I am a great fan of Yanni. Item arrived on time and in good condition as described by the seller. thanks
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My favorite feature is the audio. I can work at my desk and still listen to the good book. Well worth it
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very easy to use and has lots of different Bible translations which is a big help and changes between them very fast.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|This is a fun game; however, it costs a lot of coins to breed and capture animals. Often, there is a need to try to capture animals more than once. I was hoping that with the arrival of dinosaurs that the makers would have updated these \\"problems\\". Will play until the coins run out, or it takes too long to breed and capture.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|The discs came out of order but it took me about 20 seconds to rearrange them. The packaging is slim and neat. Um, don't buy this if you don't like Harry Potter, and if you don't, what's wrong with you?
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Would watch again, liked the plot, Good acting, Intersting History lesson that I never knew that this occured... Two thumbs up!!!
B000UR9TPK|5.0|This is one DVD I watch over and over. The concert is excellent. The sound recording and camera angle shots are good. The over all quality of this DVD concert is better than most.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Lots of action, excitement and history.  Great movie.  Heard its not exactly how it happened, but certainly makes for an entertaining movie.
B008BGNMZU|5.0|I went to a private club & listened to Bob James and he was great. I had to get his latest CD.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|Everything in this shipment was in very good shape.  I had no skipping and the picture throughout the showing was excellent.  I was very satisfied with my purchase.
B009KKLQVS|5.0|For a bunch of old guys, they've still got it.! The quality of the whole thing is well worth getting. Very good DVD.

034580404X|5.0|Love this book, it keep you wanting more. I hope to get it finished soon so I can continue with the trilogy.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|horrible broken after 3 weeks.  Based on the serial number given to lifeproof, this case is a fake.  What a waste of my money.
B009DT9ANW|5.0|Quality of DVD is worth the money, Camera angles and sound are excellent. Good lighting, good music,I really enjoy watching this over and over.
B008133MDK|1.0|The shows were absolutely wonderful.  However, Amazon (which claims to have the goal of being the most customer centric company) even after years of complaints refuses to incorporate Closed Caption for the hearing impaired into their Unbox Player.  We enjoyed the show but will purchase next season from someone other than Amazon.  Itunes has Closed Caption.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This movie is great and I have let several friends watch it and they have enjoyed just as much as I have.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Such a great movie! Starts where Bourne Ultimatum left off. Very intense action. Really cool movie with great effects and storyline. Definite must see!!!
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I enjoyed this. It was fast paced for a biography. It gave a glimpe into the life of a Navy Seal. It was just as advertized.
1593082037|5.0|Excellent layout and font.  All the stories are included, but not so small that you cannot read it.  I love Doyle!
B0050KEVO6|5.0|Nice, enjoyable little app. Interesting, and sometimes funny, results from different combinations. I do not like this word limit on here
B005LAII80|3.0|Decent movie. Good effects and definitely action packed. Not the best storyline and acting, but its entertaining. If you want to see it, rent it from RedBox
B000JRYOPG|4.0|A must have for your video collection this one is right up there with SCARFACE, great cast, pretty good acting, cool locations, and all the reggae boys acting out, when the guys come over, they want SHOTTAS on the five channel surround sound.
0679722610|5.0|I am not that into hard-boiiled detective fiction, but this book is awesome!  It actually is not that cliched and the story is exciting.  Highly recommend for anyone.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Couldn't put book down.  Loved it<br />Can't wait to read next one<br />And all the others to come out...wow great
B005LAII8K|5.0|Very interesting film! Has action and fun, but also an intriguing storyline. Its entertaining and all around a good movie to see!
B007PVHANM|5.0|I have seen many a documentary on Reggae Music or on various reggae artists, but this one is the best, I first viewed this documentary on Netflix and saved it to my favorites, to view with friends and family, but I had to purchase this documentary because it is EXCELLENT, the editing is superb, the producer really did his homework, this documentary has rare never before seen footage, the interviews are spot on and the reggae music that complement this documentary is top notch, this VIDEO gets 2 thumbs up and a really excellent tribute to MR MARLEY, WELL DONE.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Back to form in this novel, Clancy moves the action quickly using the well developed characters from the past.  A very good read.
B002ZG997C|5.0|The movie excellent, All of Denzel Washington's movies are great but his acting in this one is off the charts. They definitely chose the right man to be the lead actor in; The Book of Eli movie.
B009369Z8A|5.0|Great movie, definite must see. Great cast and storyline. Perfect movie for any Tom Hardy fan. He's great in this film!
B004SEUIXS|5.0|Such a cute feel-good movie that makes you fall in love with Audrey Tautou. Amelie opened me up to a world of wonderful French films that I never knew I'd been missing. Must watch!!
0765325950|5.0|I'm really going to miss looking forward to Robert Jordan's books. He was a great man and we have been missing him since the day he passed. Thanks for all of the wonderful hours of fantasy!!
B002KKCVUA|5.0|I've been a Teva fan ever since I went fishing in the Shenandoa River in my first pair15 years ago. Gripping any surface is easy after the rocks in the river. Here in subtropical Houston we only have three seasons... Summer, January and Hell... Thus I get to wear mine most of the year.<br /><br />They are well built with a thick sole.  All the features of a shoe without the stinky feet. I've had four pairs of Teva's  and enjoyed three of them.  The fourth was a pair of 'cheap' Tevas I put on an order just to see. I saw don't order 'cheap' Tevas.<br /><br />These are good...  So good I may order another pair in anticipation of these wearing out in several years.
B005LAII3U|5.0|Great movie! Action packed with a great storyline. Never saw the original, but I love this movie. Extremely entertaining and has something for guys and girls. Great film, definite must see!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|will be fun for older kids. got it for my 4 year old. she likes the horses, but a little advanced for her at this point on the mini games. graphics are great and controls work very well. my daughter will justhavetowatchme play.  ;)

B000AYEL6U|5.0|I saw this movie years ago and have convinced all of my friends to see it.  Everyone loves it.  I keep buying it as gifts for people.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|Great movie for the family. Brings those scary monsters into a fun and loving light. In this film the monsters are the ones afraid of humans, so it adds a funny little twist to the storyline.
B00AR15KWU|3.0|Swedish sleaze metal act Hardcore Superstar return with their ninth studio album, C'MON TAKE ON ME. The album continues the catchy hooks and guitar riff anthems the band have been known for on such tracks as, \\"One More Minute\\", \\"Above The Law\\", and \\"Won't Take The Blame\\", but the well starts to dry out from there. The production on the album is top notch, and the band continues to blend a multitude of influences into their sound, but this album just comes across as too much filler.  \\"Are You Gonna Cry Now?\\" is probably one of the heaviest tracks on album and one of my favorites. The two slow tempo songs on the album,\\"Stranger Of Mine\\" & \\"Long Time No See\\" continue to showcase Berg's vocals and Zino's fine guitar work. 6 out of 10 stars because half of this album still kicks ass!!!
B004TMPJP6|4.0|Very useful app and you can modify it to fit your needs.<br />I use it all the time for everything.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|I would recommend this product to many of my friends. Funny series that has a touching backstory to it. If you enjoy the comedy of friends, the Drama of classic TV like Frasier, and the suspense of finding out all the secrets of the series found in dramas like ER, this is the series for you!
B001BC5HXG|5.0|I love this book.  I have read it three times.  It is by far my most favorite book.  It leaves me speechless each time.  Timshel.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great price and the perfect gift for someone who loves the film series.  Huge success. We have really loved it.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|good game for kids or just killing time. It has the facebook game feel to it. works well on the kindle.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Loved it! Excellent plot, writing, editing, everything! Sort of a cliffhanger ending. Would love to see what Mr. Watson has in store for us next.
B00447G29S|5.0|This is the essential Christmas movie to have, and having it in 3D is just the thing.  It is fantastic.
B005T87QCI|3.0|Did not work on my Asus td700t but did work on my evo lte also sometimes freezes in the loading stage. When it does load it is a fun game.

B004WR125O|3.0|I have the Onkyo TX-NR 509 receiver and purchased this dongle to allow me to listen to Pandora wirelessly and also control the receiver.  Previously I was plugging my ipod into the Receiver which I was concerned might eventually wear out the USB port after repeated uses.  I read the instructions, watched the Youtube video put out by Onkyo, updated the firmware, but still had problems with the setup.  I followed the Manual setup and each time after entering the password for my wireless router the \\"Connection Failed\\" would appear.  I reread a number of the reviews and blogs with people describing problems.  At least one person stated they had tried using a simplier password on their wireless router and it worked.  That did the trick for me.  I use to have a password that included alpha numerics and symbols and now have one with only letters.  The other compliant I have is that it states a signal strength of only 50% when the rest of my devices have strong signals even though they are farther away from my router.  Seems like Onkyo didn't test this product very well before putting it on the market.  For now it will serve my purposes but nonetheless disappointed in Onkyo.  I do like the app that allows me to control the receiver from my ipod or ipad.
B00009NQQO|2.0|I have never had a problem with Alex Toys in the past, but this hoop just won't stay up!  I love the idea and the look of the hoop.  The balls are tons of fun, but I wouldn't recommend this product.
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|This was a great series!! I was the whole thing in less than 3 days. I recommend it to any one who like suspence.
B003TQKVGU|4.0|There are a lot of things that make sense in this book.  The book is a good read and the ideas within can help you, if you let them.
8866130931|5.0|Call me old-fashioned, but I love being able to jot down information in a planner versus on a computer. I purchased the 2011 planner in this size, but downsized to the pocket-sized planner in 2012. That was a mistake -- this larger planner is much more useful. There's lots of information for travelers (itinerary planner, time zones, conversion charts, holiday guides, etc.), which I mostly ignore. The print is light enough, however, that you could write notes right over all of these things if you needed more paper. Moleskine also has special downloads on their website, so if you wanted to print inserts to cover these pages, you can do that easily. The blank page just to the right of the weekly calendar is great and allows me to freely make my lists. Plus, the space for each day is more than ample. The pocket in the back is heavy duty, and in my years of using Moleskine, I've never had an issue with them ripping.<br /><br />Accept NO substitutes. Moleskine is the highest quality, most durable planner there is! My 2011 version of this planner once survived having Pepsi dumped onto it (pages held up, nothing came unstitched or unglued), and my pocket version was thrown around heavily and looked great by the end of the year. The cheaper, bookstore-brand versions of this planner are not as good of quality, are not bound as tightly, etc. I've never been disappointed with Moleskine products.
1476733953|4.0|I kindled this based on a BBC web article about the author who wrote a dystopian short story, conversed with his wife after seeing it pass a 1000 purchases on Amazon, and then decided to write a full blown novel, with a second and third to come. One of those \\"electronic self publish\\" happy stories where skill at writing fiction shone past the inevitable and usual course of publisher rejection letters. Of course, it subsequently has been picked up by a publisher like the \\"Fifty Shades...\\" series, had the aforementioned BBC article, etc....the end result is Mr Howey finds himself with a new career. I have to say that having recently seen the appalling \\"Cloud Atlas\\" - read the book, its much better - and the new Judge Dredd film I found myself reading this latest stab at a dystopia with a very critical eye. Of course, Mr Howey is treading a genre with some pretty spectacular efforts. Orwell's \\"1984\\" leaps to mind, or perhaps Atwood's \\"The Handmaiden's Tale\\". Not that, of course, a dystopia needs to be science fiction - just think of Golding's \\"Lord of the Flies\\". The ceiling is stratospheric in this field and I have to say that Howey produces a credible effort (one that appears to be snapped up for a future film and you can see why).<br />The novel revolves around a few key characters, headed by the enigmatic, engineering genius that is Juliette Nichols. The story commences with the last few days of Sheriff Holston whose wife, Allison, \\"was poking some great, overly full balloon with a needle, and Holston wanted to get that air out of it before she poked too far.\\" The balloon that Juliette, Holston, Mayor Jahns, Deputy Marnes plus a host of others all live in is a silo - a self-contained 144 level sealed unit. None have seen fresh air, none walked outside because of the toxic nature of the world outside. The only ones who venture from this \\"prison\\" are sent as a death sentence to clean the lense of the camera - that gives the people of the silo their only view of the world - before their suit falls apart and they die. It is the death of Holsten (which was the concept of the short story) that then leads the author to write the story of Juliette. A story that pits the \\"good\\" of Mechanical against the \\"evil\\" of IT. The story has as its theme the common struggle of the need for Liberty to fight the unbending narrative of Tyranny in all its forms; the threads of the plot are woven in social dogma, from enforced birth control, the chit system of payment, to the segregation of skills. The silo is a place where critical thinking is suppressed and, and inevitably becomes the birthing pits of revolution. It only takes one person to trigger great change and in this case it is Juliette. Her nemesis is Bernard, the head of IT...the Fat Controller.<br /> The result is chaos, war, death, and a new hope.<br />The concept of the silo reminded me of a Mega City One Tower block or even the scurrying lifestyle in the film \\"City of Ember\\"; the claustrophobic effects closely echo (but never match) the great fears produced in Clarke's 2001:A space Odyssey; the revolution and uncovering of the truth has roots in the Reformation. This is a world under the control of Big Brother, one where humanity has become a seed of grain that now needs to burst free of its silo and grow towards a new sunlight.<br />So...this is a good opener. I will read the next, and the last. The kindle version has few mistakes, which is a pleasant surprise. Those were minor spelling issues, such as \\"wretch\\" for \\"retch\\" (page 263, location 4069). It didn't detract. I did pause two thirds of the way into the novel as too many questions were building up. I wanted to know why Juliette et al were choosing to act as they did. Luckily, picking it back up led to a rush of answers (nothing ground shaking; you'll have seen it before in many such films/books in this genre) and the novel ends with a clear direction to move in the next book - \\"Shift\\".<br />Give it a go. It's pretty good.orld - before their suit falls apart and they die. It is the death of Holsten (which was the concept of the short story) that then leads the author to write the story of Juliette.

B005EWDA9M|5.0|It's strange and exciting. Well written and has an intrigueing plot. I would highly recommend it to everyone interested in Reading not just for fun.
B009GXHOW4|2.0|best thing ever it is really easy to use and if hour having troubles with survival you should use this
0061743526|5.0|Beautifully constructed book with a throw-back cover. This is must-read book for everyone. I highly recommend it for middle schoolers, high schoolers, college students, and adults of all ages.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|you have to get this game I love the blades my favorite one is the fire one I love it.
B00846REIS|4.0|I really liked this book and read it in a day, but some things bugged me. First, Eva is new to New York but acts like she was born there. Is a week enough time to know all the hot resturants and streets? Secondly, the sex scenes were hot but that's all they did together, yet they love each other? Sure they know a little about each others pasts, but they rarely talked or hung out without the sex. I also didn't like how Cary started off as an important character then got tossed to the side once Gideon came along or the fact that Eva never held her ground with Gideon. All he had to do was kiss her and she'd do anything for him. I'm hoping the second book is better because contrary to my complaints, I did enjoy the book.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Love, love, love this app. It does everything I want a mobile eBay app to do. Couldn't ask for more.
B001RHPJBU|4.0|Bought bec on sale and liked 3-4 songs; enjoyed most of the album except for the sappy ones. Nice music.
B005G5PPGS|3.0|I'm by no means a baseball fan, and I found this book very well written and made me appreciate the game by the end.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Look forward to next season with such a dynamic and wonderful cast; but, not happy with the cast abandoning ship for their own personal gain.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|this is an action packed movie with interesting twists start to finish.  exactly what you would expect from 007 movie.
B00122LXTM|2.0|Wow. so many songs...I thought. Well, more stunk than I thought would... oh well. LTR, even What a fool believes are good.
B001FB55I0|3.0|This is worth what I paid for it...I was happy with my purchase and I would recommend it to anyone
0385742886|5.0|I am so happy with the entire series of this book. It is such a page turner. It is hard to put the book down once you picked it up.
B0058YPGSY|3.0|is a movie what can you say graphic and vulger but thats what this show is about if you don't like bikes and babes don't buy
B002RKSZKI|5.0|What more is there to say. Love having my favorites of her book any time on the kindle app on my phone.
B0012FHGCW|5.0|A movie worth watching. I found the best part was living in the wild of Alaska.<br />Do not want to give too much detail to spoil watching this movie.
0385738781|5.0|I loved the 3rd installment of the Maze Runner Series. It help explain a lot and yet left a lot to your imagination.
B009KEN87O|4.0|This is definitely a high quality game worth playing! This is definitely going to be a favorite among the lovers of old arcade-type games. It is really retro in that aspect. This is a fantastic space shooter app. The controls are great, visuals and sounds are great, and the gameplay is fun even as you progress. I love the alternate gameplay views. Also, surprisingly there is no I.A.P. So there are lots of levels to unlock by actually playing and not paying! Really well done game.
0739352687|5.0|My son loves these books, but we'd only been able to find book 1 on cd. He loves being able to have all of his favorites when we travel anywhere in the car.<br /><br />Only problem was how long it took to get here. This was ordered 3 weeks before his birthday. I was charged about a week after the order, but the cd's didn't show up until his actual birthday. Unless they were shipping this by camel, this was completely ridiculous. Would definitely NOT use this seller again!
B00007LTIB|5.0|In a sense Relayer is the right bookend, the left bookend would be Close To The Edge, with Tales Of Topographic Oceans in the center, the ultimate Prog Sandwich.
B000002GYN|5.0|I enjoyed this CD, and am only sorry I waited so many years to purchase it. I had the LP in the 70's but stopped listening to it when the old turntable died. Thank goodness I decided to buy this
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very good solitaire game. I would highly recommend this for your basic time killing game while you wait for your car to be fixed or in the doctors office
B002RKSZWG|5.0|What more is there to say. Love having my favorites of her book any time on the kindle app on my phone.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This DVD was amazing.  It was extremely insightful.  A revealing look into the problems of our country. We learned a lot and have watched it several times.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|One of the best, with so many twists and turns you cannot see the end from the beginning. Also, romance is accomplished without sleeze, which is important to me.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I watched it four times in one week with my four year old niece and she loved it! She couldn't stop talking about it.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|A group of British seniors check out retirement in a foreign, exotic setting. Their adventures are hilarious, moving, with strong and diverse personalities reacting to their new environment and the new culture in a convincing and realistic way. There is understanding and sympathy, intransigence and narrow mindedness, the whole melded together by superb acting- how could there not be with such a strong cast?  One of the best movies I have seen in a long while, and one I would want to watch many times over.
B000W93CHC|5.0|This was a very well written  sequel , tears at one point which while reading doesn't  often happen to me
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I love this book I read it every night before.I go to bed.I'd recommended this ebook to every one. It so awesome.
0375869026|5.0|I recently had a baby born with a cranio-facial syndrome. I wasn't aware of many cranio-facial syndromes until my baby was born. I hope that this book creates awareness for others in similar situations. The book Wonder brought me to tears and made me smile. I was able to relate to Augusts' mother and it helped me to see and understand how August felt. I have purchased many copies of this book for friends and family as well as elementary and middle schools in my city. August is a hero and I hope he can inspire other children who look different. Always CHOOSE KINDNESS!!!
B00006FDCD|5.0|This gem scared the crap out of me when I was a young kid and a few years ago I just had the urge to buy this movie to watch it again just to see if I can get through the movie without being scared! I hope this movie never gets remade by hollywood because this stands out as one of the very best Stephen King novel based movies of all time. WARNING, do NOT let you're young children watch this movie if they are under ten or something otherwise you're kids will end up sleeping in you're bed due to being scared or sleeping on the floor next to the bed and you may step on you're child the next morning when you wake up lol
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It's a very entertaining game for the most part. But there's a glitch I think sometimes it doesn't save my progress and I'd have to redo some stuff.
1600242197|5.0|and great American. I had the audio cd first, but the book is better. When you read it, you can \\"hear\\" Marcus' voice. Go ahead and get his next book [[ASIN:0316185361 Service: A Navy SEAL at War]], because you'll read this in one or two sittings.<br /><br />Thank you, Marcus
B004UXUX7S|5.0|What can i say great movie and i have the dvd and blue ray disc so no matter where i go i can watch the movie
B002I0J5FG|5.0|TWO GREAT underrated games on 1 disc that truly pushed the playstation 2 to it's limits back in the day. To this day it still holds up INCREDIBLY well on the PS3, even without the HD stuff it still looks amazing. Both of these games should be played by every PS3 owner because it's one of those games that really makes the players feel very emotionally attached to the main characters, etc.<br /><br />BUY NOW before they eventually stop selling this collection because I have a feeling this collection will become a collector's item in the future and possibly rare on auction sites as well. I already beat both games and truly love both games. Every now and then I pop in Shadow or Ico every year just to replay both of these epic games.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|this is a good match three game.  not to difficult, and let's you retry any level you want if you do not rate enough stars to your liking.  the graphics are bright and clear.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|We've been enjoying this series.  It is fun for the whole family to watch.  I was a little disappointed in the ending but I won't talk specifics here.  Just that it seemed more of a ploy than a true ending.
B006HL9G10|4.0|I keep getting static in the audio.I un & reinstalled,same problem.Too bad, I would have liked it otherwise.My device is the Samsung Galaxy 5.0.Anybody else having this problem??I gave it 4 stars because I don't blame the app for a device problem & it is a good app, just not for SG 5.0 player!!
B001MEJY8W|5.0|If you are looking for a powerful horror film that will make you feel so connected to the characters in the movie, then you MUST buy this movie. Of course this movie is not for everyone because the average movie watcher cannot handle this movie and are probably too lazy to read subtitles but they can read text messages on their mobile devices, etc. DON'T let the subtitles bother you, this movie is absolutely crazy and amazing at the same time. It can also be somewhat a piece of art because this is the director debut movie and it is certainly an amazing first movie. I do not want to spoil anything about this movie but just BUY it, you will not regret it!
1616550414|5.0|A neat collection of concept art and notes that show how they developed the Zelda series and how it evolved to what it is today!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Perfect for those who want to have the books and read the series without paying for the hardcover prices since the show came out.
B009CPTG90|5.0|This was a favorite of my grandchildren (ages 30 and 27 now). It is my first choice for baby gifts!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wonderful. Ready for the next book. Would definitely recommend to anyone. It really draws you in and keeps you hooked.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|If you like this type of movie,of course you will like this one. Pretty good color and picture. Well worth the price. I would highly recommend anyone to add it to their collection.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|This was bought as s gift.  I watch the show when it airs.  It is one of my favorite shows.  I send the seasons to my busy daughter who watches them when she can.  She loves them, too.  We have read the books and like the shows better.
B00BEPVAV8|1.0|The screen is jacked up this is a piece of crap. I would not download this thing if i was you.
B001JIFYSA|3.0|I don't understand how you expect me to review a product I haven't even had physically in my possession yet. You have asked me to do this on more than one occasion, and I generally ignore it, which is why I almost never review products I purchase. I would not be writing this now, but you caught me in a very bad mood, and I feel like fussing at somebody for stupidity.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Loved it, read it in be day. Well written, intelligent and very entertaining :)  a very good choice of a book.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This is a really creative and exciting show.The characters are very addictive to watch and know about. You want to know about everything they are doing. You can easily get attached to them. The main characters, Olivia, Peter, and Walter are just a few and you want them to be safe and together. I really love this show. I have introduced this show to many of my family and friends and they are just as excited about the show as I am. It's simply great.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|wonderful game and the fact I'm not pressured to buy stuff....bingo blingo I love but its too hard to keep coins and tickets
B00A83075M|5.0|Great characters with solid motivations and an innovative concept.  To sum it up, it's the Toy Story of video games.
B009RH973I|5.0|My daughter loves it. excellent fit. Case protects the Kindle just like it should.  Much better price than other cases
B00BRR66SA|4.0|I still don't think it is as good as Future Sex/Love Sounds but it is definitely growing on me. There are about 4 that I absolutely love.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this series! They were great reads the books got better by the book. Sad that there will be no more..... I could see a few  more great possibilities where the adventures could go on.
B008XG1X18|3.0|A well-meaning relative signed me up for Pinterest, and within a short time I had people &#34;following me&#34; and I wasn't even able to respond and thank them. So, I asked others to show/tell me, but none have come forth, so to me--it is one of the world's best kept secrets. I am quite sure I will be overwhelmed with embarrassment when I find out how simple it is...but in the meantime, I wait...and wait...and wait.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|It has some bugs as you get in the game .it won't allow you to visit others villages where you have to collect hearts to complete tasks.you lose your hearts for performance.and it takes animals when new village opens up.but it is a fun and addictive game.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|The writing is excellent.  The story ok. The beginning of the book was hard to keep going back, but the end was very compelling
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really like this game and my friend showed it to me so I had to get. if you like challenges then this. is the app
B008KYOCA2|2.0|It was ok I thought until I tried to enter dates for reminders on the calender.  If the &#34;system&#34; did not recognize a word, i.e,  Koger Bv. it gave you Lover Bc.  No way to override it.  Will probably delete and just carry the planner with me again.
B004LUHQ1G|4.0|The Digipack kind of sucks, cause it scratches the CD. Anyways, arrived on time and good shape  . . .
B007IXWKUK|5.0|i could put this book down i love the christian grey and anna. it is a must read for all.
B000W07EKW|5.0|Owning this collection allows my husband and I to finally watch a series that never seems to grow old, from beginning to end! The boxed set is a perfect addition to our movie collection. For anyone who loves thriller movies this is a must have!
B007N5YIUS|4.0|While i like Angry Birds, I hate the advertisements.  I purchased one A.B. Game which was supposed to be ad free BUT it isn't.
B0014BQQYS|5.0|This movie is a classic. Paul Newman and Robert Redford are phenomenal and the story is very interesting. Everyone should see this movie at least once, it's worth it, you'll watch it again.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is so fun and simple to play. It will be appreciated by young and old alike for its retro looks and smooth game play. Definitely worth a buy
B008JFUN8C|3.0|As the title suggests, \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" is an origin story of L. Frank Baum's famous wizard with a very long name. James Franco plays \\"Oz,\\" a small-time womanizing stage magician whisked away into the wonderland, where he meets three witches Theodora (Mila Kunis), Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and Glinda (Michelle Williams).<br /><br />Just like Tim Burton-directed \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" Sam Raimi's new film is filled with dazzling visuals (shot with 3D viewing in mind), but doesn't have a story to tell, or a character to root for. The colorful production design by Robert Stromberg (also responsible for \\"Alice in Wonderland\\") is impressive, to the point of almost becoming the real star of this fantasy adventure film.<br /><br />I like James Franco, but I am not sure he is the right choice for the role of a self-centered con man we are supposed to like. There is almost no character development that is interesting. Because of the film's by-the-numbers script, his portrayal of Oz before he became a great \\"wizard\\" looks bland, and his spiritual transformation unconvincing.<br /><br />This is a decent family-oriented picture that is mildly amusing. Sam Raimi, director of \\"Evil Dead\\" and \\"Spider-man\\" series, plays it too safe here, but perhaps we should know he is supposed to do so.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|actor were brilliant, storyline very compelling to me as a disabled woman. easy to download, good price. thank you, connie
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a very fun game. It doesn't make loud sounds. The sound is very calm. This game also works very well with your brain and the way you see things. The colors are very vivid and bright with makes it interesting. I recommend this game for ages 6 and up. I hope my review helped you throughout wanting to get this game. REMEMBER. You can always remove this game from your device. This game is free so if you don't like it you can remove this from your device without feeling like you wasted any money. Again I hope this helped you.
B00004SAAX|5.0|This is an uncomparable collection of most of J. S. Bach's organ works.  The performances by Helmut Walcha are flawless, highly emotional, and of course recording quality is excellent.  The first three disks contain the \\"great\\" organ works, from Walcha's 1956-1962 recordings at St Laurenskerk, Alkmaar, Netherlands, most of which were in the Archiv 5-LP vinyl set, \\"The Art of Helmut Walcha.\\"  My records are a bit thin, they have been played a lot, through many of the major events of my life.  Mysteriously missing from the first three CD's, though, is his St Laurenskerk recording of BWV 552, Prelude and Fugue in Eb Major, which recording is especially notable on the record: to my taste one of the greatest recordings of any Bach composition, still thrilling and inspiring after many years of listening.  But in the 12-CD boxed set being reviewed, BWV 552 is hidden back on disks 8 and 9, 1970 recording(s) from the Saint-Pierre-le Jeune, Strasbourg -- still a very good performance but pallid in comparison to the St Laurenskerk performance. I was very much looking forward to this, a little disappointed.  Nonetheless, deserves 5 stars plus!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't express how much Downton Abbey Makes me smile.  Love it!  Can't wait for season Four!  Thanks to Amazon for having it so easy to access!
B00B23O96A|1.0|I want a Clapton record that showcases the genius of his guitar playing. This is not the record. Off hand I commented that this is the worst record that I have purchased in years. Sorry Eric, we've reached the end of the road. Its been down hill for years and now I'm done.
B0032CVAQQ|3.0|It would be much more help if  the author gave a way to figure out your spouse's love language too. Also I think that many men probably fall into the touch category and I would be curious what the author suggests as help for a husband who's wife doesn't have the same libido as he.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great book it's emotional and gets you mad and makes you cry I loved this book it is now one of my favorites 😊 it's worth it to read don't hesitate and read it first before you see the movie
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Very good,several times I was on the edge of my seat.Very happy Logan survived.I viewed  Keith as a sleaze from the beginning, glad it ended the way it did
B00BJ9VBLI|1.0|wont download. after trying 4 times I gave up. too bad; I love match 3 games. hope they fix it soon.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|In my opinion this is another good book in the good line of books. It continues the story from where the last book left off.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great game.. will recommend to others.<br />Angry Birds Angry Birds Angry Birds Angry Birds Angry Birds Angry Birds Angry Birds Angry Birds Angry Birds<br />Yesss!
0525952926|5.0|I didn't think Ken Follet could improve on the first in the Century Trilogy, &#34;Fall of Giants&#34; as it was excellent. If you can believe it, &#34;Winter of the World&#34; was even better. As you read the well researched pages you were brought back in history to a time that saw the world on the brink of secumbing to the worse bestial human behavior imaginable As you turned each page you felt as though you there were living it as history came alive and you cared for the characters, both real and imagined., The scenes were so vivid you became frightened and thought this could not have happened but you know that it did.. This series should be requred reading in our schools.Some world leaders were so immoral as to be unbelievable but these deeds did hapen with whole nations falling under the hipnotic power of evil, and who is to say it couldn't reoccur without proper vigilance.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|Dont get me wrong, this is a great series and there is a lot of character depth in this series, but IMO this book spends a mojority of its time with characters I didn't really care about. every time I hit a new chapter I found my self feeling let down when I saw who's point of view I was going to be reading for awhile. this book seems like its full of important info, and you just need to plow through it, so you can get back to the good stuff again.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|Good app... recommended to all... Downloaded app to personal cell phone as well.<br />angry birds angry birds angry birds angry birds angry birds angry birds angry birds angry birds angry birds<br />Will use again.
B0096Y6EUG|5.0|This live album is a must for any Simon fan. These contemporary interpretations of his classic songs will never replace the originals, but they stand alongside them beautifully.
1449410243|5.0|This is a great little compilation of cat comics from the Oatmeal. If you have a cat, or you know someone with a cat, you need to get this book so you can put it on your coffee table and make guests laugh when they browse through it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Very Good read. Just what I expected.<br />Will recommend to friends, family, coworkers, other readers and more. Storyline was good and very interesting.<br />Fast shipping and in good condition.  Will order again soon from this vendor.<br />Good page turner as well.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Rio was a hoot. Gets fairly challenging but nothing that some practice can't fix. Great colors add to the fun.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|I am writing this review based on 5-6 listens since I got it a few days ago. The CD starts out really strong with my two favorite tracks, \\"Earth Rocker\\" and \\"Crucial Velocity\\". It is evident from the start that they are focusing less on the blues and jams and more on the rock n roll aspect. Being a metal fan, I can appreciate that even though I have liked everything they have released. \\"Mr. Freedom\\" and \\"DC Sound Attack\\" are solid while \\"Unto the Breach\\" is great. \\"Gone Cold\\" is a nice little break in the action with a slow, soulful song to catch your breath. \\"Book, Saddle, and Go\\" and \\"Cyborg Bette\\" are cool, upbeat rockers as well.<br /><br />Overall, I am a satisfied Clutch fan with this hard rockin release. It's possible that I will have to add another star to this review after spending more time with it.<br /><br />***UPDATE*** After more listens, a fifth star has been added. Just a great CD and my favorite since Pure Rock Fury. \\"Gone Cold\\" is stuck in my brain!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Great game.. will recommend to others.<br />Angry Birds Angry Birds Angry Birds Angry Birds Angry Birds Angry Birds Angry Birds Angry Birds Angry Birds
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent cast, crew, costume, location...excellent everything. It's not like watching a TV show; It's like watching the lives of a real family. I enjoyed the insight into the lives of servanthood including their work, relations with the family they serve, and what they do for entertainment in their time off. Downton Abbey has changed my perception of these relationships in history.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is the best game ever made I love it. way better than minecraft who does.not love horses they are beautiful creatures
B004SOR4H6|1.0|Good app... recommended to all... Downloaded app to personal cell phone as well.<br />Twitter twitter twitter twitter Twitter twitter twitter twitter Twitter twitter twitter twitter<br />Will use again
B00APUYN0I|5.0|This movie is awesome!! The cast has great chemistry and talent! You get to see the diversity of students and how some of their relationships click and how some just don't. This movie is funny, fun to watch, and I found myself rooting for the underdog. Then again, who doesn't? There are a wide range of emotions experienced watching this movie from awe to frustration. I had no interest initially but I watched it out of curiousity because it got such great reviews. All I have to say is I am so thankful I did! It was worth every minute I spent watching it!!
B003V5CFV8|4.0|Classic... great music & acting.  I love that I can order this from home through Amazon on my ROKU box!
B001C4AFOY|4.0|I enjoyed the story very much, I know it is loosely based on fact, but enough of the facts were there to keep it interesting.
B004ZNACA6|4.0|i love to have all pink floyd discography in one box set but i was expecting sth more for the packaging is too simple
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have bad dreams if I DON'T watch... This show is awesome and I love that I can order from Amazon through my ROKU!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Love this app. Hooked on it after just a few minutes. It's a keeper. Try it, you will like it. Cheers!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great Autobiography by the author, Chris Kyle. It was a very interesting book, I didnt want to put it down.
B00BBQXUYK|4.0|Classic... great animation, very creative.  I love that I can order this from home through Amazon on my ROKU box!
B0036EH3XE|5.0|This is a series I could watch over and over from start to finish without ever getting sick of it. Lost was a great series and still is in my opinion. Yeah there was some &#34;what the?&#34; moments but was still the best show and they could not have had a better cast.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My family loved the plot. The humor was great for kids and adults. John C. Reilly and Sarah Silverman we're awesome.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was a great read that I would highly suggest to anyone of any age. The character and plot progression was simply beautiful and it seemed to hit every note spot on. It played with your heart because you can relate to what is being said. By far one of the best books I've read.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved the characters in this book, and working with the mentally ill, found it realistic in it's portrayal of  their plights.  NOW, I will see the movie!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|A page turner! Well written and fascinating. I love that it picks up from the first book.  I am on to the next AND know that will be just as wonderful!
B00425S1H8|4.0|Didn't work with WIndows 7, but that could just be that I didn't use it correctly.  I used it on an older laptop with Windows XP and it works great.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|There was so much hype surrounding this book that I expected much more from it. It was an ok distraction at best.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Very funny and nice video game twist.  My 11 year old girl really enjoyed it as well.  Fun for the whole family
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|Really disappointed in the quality of this app. They are harvesting your info but you get no perks of using your Facebook account.
B00005JMEW|4.0|This show is well done. Actually, I prefer volume two, but this one is good as well. I don't get why people think Uma is so hot, though. To me she has a number of masculine features LOL. But she does an excellent job of acting so who cares!
B0022W6L6G|5.0|Fleetwood Mac does some of the best harmonies.  With this, their 'Greatest Hits' - you can not go wrong!  Awesome!
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|very good game. it is very fun and addictive. can play for a very long time. only problem is that it sometimes glitches and will take awhile to get back to the game.
B0049P1VHS|2.0|i love the walking dead but both discs were glitchy and eventually would freeze. (i tried this on numerous dvd players). Seller was great on shipping in a timley manor as a plus side.
0061906220|5.0|My 2 year old nephew already has parts of this book memorized. Wonderful book to help teach colors, fruits, and a general feel-good attitude about life. I can't wait to introduce the song!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is the best ive played sk far in my life well not in life ive played better games bug y'all know wat I mean
B000JBWWBK|5.0|I was hesitant about buying any more of Crowe because in all that we have he appears to be stuck on himself.  It came with Reeves in &#34;A Walk in the Coulds&#34; which we really wanted and I thought &#34;two for one&#34; so I bought the set.  I'm glad I did because Year has become one of my favorites.  I also got a chance to see another side of Crowe - and I like this side.  I recommend this movie, and A Walk in the Clouds, to everyone.
B00A23MYCC|5.0|Just what you would expect from Seth McFarland. This is a truly hilarious flick with plenty of curse words and toilet humor. My husband is also an ultimate Flash Gordon fan, so you can't go wrong with this movie for him.
B009KEN87O|5.0|this game is a lot of fun and the ship controls a lot better than other shooters I have tried
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|These products work great. No problem with packaging and shipping was awesome. These were items that I have been looking for a while and I am glad that I had more options that I had found before, so kudos for that Amazon! Thank you very much!!
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|This should be mandatory reading for all US and EU High School age students!  The next time you see a celeb or some liberal media wonk trying to convince you that we should be embracing a relationship with this evil dictatorship...just say no and demand that the people of the world know the living hell that is N. Korea.
B005HSL626|5.0|I actually loved this game, but I burned out on it fast. It is fun to chop the heck out of all the fruit! :)
B000VI12ZS|3.0|Good movie, but it was missing something! The story line was good and the acting was ok. I'd watch it again!
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|I wanted to make sure my grandaughter would have a positive memory of Peter Pan, and the enjoyment of family that i had growing up, so many negative happenings in the world .
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Easy to play, lots of fun for kids of all ages. A great stress reliever, I play at less once a day sometimes more.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Great movie...especially on blu ray disk. My only issue is it would be nice if pre-orders arrived on release day.
034580404X|5.0|Bought for a friend, she is enjoying them, I might even read them when she is done.<br />Sound exciting. LOL
B009KEN87O|5.0|Looking for a fun way to take up time, then this is it. This is a must have app, This is old school but way better, really relaxing and fun if you ever enjoyed space invaders as a kid you will love this one. I feel its an updated and much better version. A must have, if you dont get it you will miss out.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|Another  great  album  from  Justin. Nice,  upbeat songs,  great  instrument  songs.  The  beats  and music  is  awesome paired with his voice.  Love the album.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|This movie was awesome I would recommend it to anybody. I would watch it again anytime anywhere. He played such a good lincolin
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Macht spass und ist ein super Zeitvertreib für Pausen. Suchtgefahr :-)selten eine so gute Grafik bei einem Spiel gesehen welches auch noch kostenlos angeboten wird.
B0086213XW|5.0|Although the beginning was slow, and seemed a bit forced, once past the initial meet of the main characters - i fell in love with this story.  It was an examination of what it means to be human - nothing seemed contrived or overly simplified.  Loved it - loved it.  Even cried at the end.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book had an excellent story to it. Three actually, Jason's, Piper's, and Leo's. It was amazing, especially to me... an eleven year old. You know how most stories have a really boring spot? This book never dropped me!<br />(I have signed in to edit this review to say that this was actually written by my 11 year old daughter who did not know she was signed into my account.)
B00A83075M|4.0|I am 21 year old female movie buff and gamer. Love this movie! Watched it 4 times the first week. Been quoting ever since. My only beef is that the dvd itself was skipping on the first play and had problems with the subtitles. (Appeared sometimes, not always, and became fuzzy and obstructive.) But this is a great movie. Recommend to anyone. :)
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This had some great information that the American people need to know. If you thought you knew what you were eating, watch this movie.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|This movie exceeds expectations on a monumental scale. I can not wait for more to come! Thank you for sticking to the book!
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I Love this movie I bought for my to be born daughter so she can enjoy what good movies are sicne they dont make them like they used to.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|AS ALWAYS BOND IS THE BEST, AND THIS ONE IS THE BEST YET.  KEEP THEM COMING...<br />DANIEL CRAIN IS AWESOME
B007REV4YI|5.0|Daniel Craig is once again, outstanding in his role of James Bond, Agent 007. He shows More emotion and a vulnerability that captures his authentic side. Less hitman, more human. This has all of the action, drama, energy and explosive storytelling that the great Bond films display but we get to see even more into 007 and M.<br />James Bond, women love him, men want to be him!.....and drive that ASTON MARTIN!
B00867GJYK|5.0|This movie is awsome for kids they would love it and adulats too, I seen it many times and even made me get a aquarium for my home, its a must have specially in Blu-Ray.
B0055PMJMW|4.0|After reading several reviews, I wasn't sure I wanted to waste any money on this or the other collection of three short Harry Bosch stories. Well, I'm glad I did because these stories, complete with everything people have complained about, were fantastic for me, a Harry Bosch fan. I finished &#34; The black box&#34; and was caught up with all that is/was Bosch. These stories (including the other three, I can't recall the name of the collection, though I'm sure it would be painfully easy to look it up, but I'm not! Ha! Plus, this has gone on enough.) These stories feed that craving you get when you get to the the end of the line and want more. And NOW I am all caught up on all that is Bosch. While all the complaints certainly have merit, you just have to ask yourself... am I a Harry Bosch fan?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|thiis book was on the New York Times best list it intriqued my interest. The underlined story made me want to know the facts on the main characters.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|It is fun but there are people that play on here that aren't taking the game seriously and simply draw what the answer is by typing out the word answer.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like this game but can't play it that much because if freezes.  :(  Can you please fix it.  Thank you.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Awesome book couldn't put it down. Can't wait to read other books by ELIZABETH  HAYNES.it would make a great movie.
B0087GF8ZG|3.0|Hi. I got one of these Hipe (good name, Hipe...ironic) motion/heat sensing lights for safety, to use in a dark hallway. When I got it out of the box, I thought the switch looked  very flimsy. And the Velcro mounting method is one I have never had good luck with.<br />The short story...a day after I installed it, it fell off the wall where it had been mounted above a door, onto the carpet.<br />When I found it, it was in pieces on the floor. Not only had the Velcro attachment gimmick failed, but the chintzy switch button had snapped off too! My fears had been realized. Other than that, it works good. But the light stays on longer than the 10 seconds stated. About 30 seconds, so it's no big deal.<br />I gave it three stars only because (so far) the electronic part is working fine. But I won't buy another one.<br />I'm not going to bother returning it, because I can use it with the broken switch, and it's easier than shipping it back (and no doubt having to pay postage).<br /><br />Thank you, and good night. Richard
B00BBI9WD6|4.0|The people in it.  It fun to read about strong women. I has black hats and white hats. Let us not<br />forget the cats
1451650728|5.0|Great read, a bit slow at the beginning. I would recommend this book and the series to my fellow Star Trek friends.
B00BFHZOCG|5.0|it was pretty good covers i like the remix verson of crawl and jailbreak was only a ep people are rating it like it was a album
B009KEN87O|4.0|Great choice for FAOTD. I'm hoping to see an update for longer &quot;invincible&quot; mode with better controls for moving ship in 3-D mode. Other than that, this game rules :)
B009KEN87O|4.0|Awesome time waster. Easy enough to figure out. Played the first ten or so levels and there are some fun interesting twists to this game. Recommended.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love to play this game when i have a few minutes of free time. Its not rocket science. but its super addictive
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this app! Had installed previously on my Samsung droid, so it was one of the first I loaded on my new Kindle. Cards are responsive, and one of the very rare apps that always works. If you're looking for a variety of solitaire games look elsewhere. But if you enjoy the original Klondike version, look no further!
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|We bought this pack for the kids as a gift. They had never seen it before and I had not seen it in awhile. They love it!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Awesome awesome awesomeness! Great game that brings back alot of memories! I love the little differences between this and the original that make it that much better!
B007REV4YI|5.0|I believe Judy Dencsch and Daniel Craig did an excellant preformance. This story line took a welcome change in direction from the norm of 007. I enjoyed all the 007 movies over the years. However, the Roger Moore movies generally are somewhat bad, Roger Moore just doesn't cut it. Try a remake with someone else and they would do a lot better. Seven remakes, not a bad thought.<br />Roger Moore - &#34;Sir&#34; - what a joke, he's no more a sir than I am a saint.<br />Watch Skyfall, you'll love it and it has a very good story line, I bought the blu-ray and I'm glad I spent the money.<br />Go for it!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book! This book is a nail biter towards the end. So many details that can't be visualized any other way.
B006QVRX9S|5.0|I got this set mainly for the t-shirt.<br />The cds themselves were previously released.<br /> If you like the Beach Boys,get it.<br />One problem most fans already have these songs on cd on another compilation!
B007ZXK08C|5.0|WOW...... what a great book. Unbelievable how things can turn out.<br />Just goes to show people are not what they seem........its a shame sometimes
B00B10DZQE|5.0|I ENJOYED IT.. I DON'T LIKE THAT I HAVE TO TYPE A STORY JUST TO LEAVE A RATING/ THAT SUCKS
086547897X|5.0|Well written, heavily illustrated, and incredibly helpful for anyone studying animation or even 3D.  Easy to read and understand. Highly recommended.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book!!! Can't wait to read the next one!!  This one was definitely way, way better than the first one!!!
B005BGBP3Y|5.0|I ENJOYED IT.. I DON'T LIKE THAT I HAVE TO TYPE A STORY JUST TO LEAVE A RATING/ THAT SUCKS
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Works very well when print  is really small and even slender fingers seem too big for the print.  The three sizes of tips make it very versatile.<br />I would definitely recommend this stylus to my friends.
B00A72989U|5.0|I Love it! She continues to make amazing albums; I would know I have all of them. She is one of my favorite artists.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Well worth the price paid for. Strong, durable, extremely well made. Perfect fit in the hand for any serious knife inthusiast.
B00B671VYU|4.0|This band is kind of a guilty pleasure of mine. I'm not really all that much into shock rock, but Lordi knows how to make a perfect combination of 80's style rock and giving that modern day horror rock spin to it.<br /><br />I've had a chance to listen to it all the way through about 5 or 6 times now so I feel like I've gotten a pretty good grasp of my opinion. It's a good solid album with a lot of catchy vocals and hooks galore. It's certainly better than their last two outings (Babez for Breakfast and Deadache) but not quite as good as Get Heavy or my personal favorite, The Arockalypse (amazing album, get it if you don't have it).<br /><br />I actually questioned buying this album at first due to Lordi seeming to go down hill recently. I don't ever see them topping The Arockalypse. Deadache was a solid album but just didn't have too many memorable songs (Missing Miss Charlene and Bite It Like a Bulldog were the big hits of the album). As for Babez for Breakfast... I personally didn't care for that album at all. Lordi is known for some cheesy lyrics but Babez went a little too far in that department and not a single song from the album was very memorable.<br /><br />Back to this album. It has some amazing guitar hooks and great lyrics in terms of both melody and content, good enough to have me humming it after only a few listens. However, Lordi's sound has changed quite drastically, which is to be expected with a new keyboardist (Hella) and new drummer (Mana). You'll just have to listen to see what I'm talking about, it's difficult to explain.<br /><br />1) We're Not Bad For The Kids (We're Worse) - Catchy chorus, fast paced, 80's metal sound (9/10)<br />2) I Luv Ugly - Absolutely insane intro riffs between the guitar and keyboard, very catchy (8/10)<br />3) The Riff - Typical radio friendly single, but great content (9/10)<br />4) Something Wicked This Way Comes - Solid song, not great but not bad (7/10)<br />5) I'm The Best - Cool intro BUT super cheesy lyrics, repetetive, borderline annoying (4/10)<br />6) Horrifiction - Freaky intro, softer ballad style song, good lyrics, catchy chorus (8/10)<br />7) Happy New Fear - Decent song but again, nothing special (7/10)<br />8) Schizo Doll - Another freaky intro, ultimately this is nothing more than a filler song (5/10)<br />9) Candy for the Cannibal - Cool guitar hook, catchy, amazing chorus (9/10)<br />10) Sincerely with Love - I was pretty shocked at the explicatives, almost made the album PA worthy (8/10)<br />11) SCG6: Otus' Butcher Clinic - this really isn't a song, it's a tribute to their fallen drummer (X/10)<br /><br />Summary:<br />I personally love the album, it's much better than I expected. Better than their last two, but doesn't quite stack up against Get Heavy or The Arockalypse. It has enough good tracks to earn 4/5 stars.
B007U8U1V8|5.0|Glad I bought this one... he is one of my favorites and you can't beat the price on Amazon!  Buy it!
B00A8307BG|5.0|if you love RT this is fantastick!!!!<br />really good! any blues lover has to have it!<br />love the bass it rocks
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A suspenseful story with an unexpected ending.  The heartbreak and dedication of the mother was so tangible that one could feel every inch of her pain.
B008B68J2G|5.0|The Scaris Café Cart set is a wonderful accompaniment to the Monster High Dolls.  The first thing my granddaughter does when she comes over is get out the doll and the café set and she can play with it for a long time without getting bored.  She can also use Barbie sized dolls with the café set.  She sets up 2 dolls at once and they have the best conversations (for a 5 yr old).<br /><br />I do recommend this play set.  While my granddaughter is only 5, she has cousins that are 8 and 11 and they also enjoy playing with the dolls and the café set.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|Mo Mother loves this movie to death or should I say to pieces. This is her all time movie to watch..
1572814136|1.0|Hate them. My previous deck needed to be replaced but this looks nothing like the original Rider tarot cards. Cards are way too light.
B008KE3960|5.0|Great game with many hours of fun. Great that they have added more maps. Would love additional maps to continue playing. Love it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Interesting plot, but drags just a little...it was definitely not an ending that I expected and as I read a lot, it is hard to surprise me.
B007BT0RKG|1.0|I deleted this app from my kindle fire as it is practically useless to me.  I just want to download maps of specific areas where I might be traveling. I want to be able to refer to them offline when I need for road names, routes, towns, etc. I downloaded a few maps of areas that I was familiar with to check the map's accuracy. There were large areas of missing information, not all roads or towns were shown, and even worse, many things were labeled with false names. If I didn't already know the area I would not realize the maps are incorrect.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|so cool and fun and so happy it was free. I always play it (: so cool (: (: (: (: l love it and the updates always new
B002GHIPYI|3.0|these headphones work fine, but the vinyl is uncomfortable and hot and it could be made better for more comfort.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Reflected in You is a great continuation of<br />Eva and Coss stormy relationship. The last few chapters had me on the edge of my seat.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|a good deal, lots of bonus features. Every thing is as advertised. The package shipped promptly. I give it five stars!
B00AQB2A3I|3.0|To begin with, so I'm not hit with alot hate. I do like it, it is enjoyable, BUT I have to be honest, to me it's nothing new. Sounds like disc 2 3 or 4 of yet another PT recording. Again, I did like its just nothing that I haven't heard before.
B0000CFW87|5.0|A very good example of this talented young man. Beautifully produced and sensitive. Really moves the heart. If only there were a few more artists like this. Well done Mr.Groban.
B001AQO46E|4.0|Whats taking so long James? Been waiting for this forever. One of my favorite action spy movies from James Cameron with hilarious dialog and great ending! Highly recommended!
B0000024YL|5.0|Superb mastery of commentary on life during the 60's, 70's. Are you going to Scarborough Fair, tripping down the alleyways, a vision of organdie and lamplight and juniper. Wonderful.
1603429999|4.0|Lovely book, full of great information. I'd previously purchased the &#34;Teach Visually&#34; circular knitting book and was disapointed.  Believe it or not, this one is way less confusing and complicated, and also fun to read.  I may sell the other one.<br /><br />Circular and double pointed techniques given for each pattern.  I wanted to move on to knit hats, I just couldn't achieve the right look with a hook :).  Loving it so far.  Book is reader-friendly, pictures are beautiful and helpful, lovely blend of pretty and practical.  If you are a an accessory crafter, or a sweater-maker, I'd pick this up.
B007885IJU|5.0|Amazing album!!!  I would absolutely recommend this album as a MUST HAVE for your collection!  Don't delay, order it today.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|This album is wonderful. Music needed JT back. He's a wonderful live performer, has a great voice and is a wonderful comedic force! This guy does it all. I LOVE the R&B Old Soul Flavor on most of these tracks and love those tracks that are extended. I can't get \\"Pusher Love Girl\\", \\"That Girl\\" and \\"Suit & Tie\\" off my brain. Welcome back to Timbaland as well; one of the ultimate MUSIC PRODUCERS of all time!
B009KEN87O|4.0|This game is similar to the old game galaxia, only it has power ups and different enemy types that keep things interesting. Not bad.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Every book Vince has written I Love.  at the  moment I am still in process of reading.  Scary. Wonderful expectant.
B008N1V11U|4.0|This game is cool, the graphics are pretty good, Cool gameplay. I love the way it works on my kindle fire.
B009KEN87O|3.0|This game can be fun but at the same time could be very harmful. I was only playing it for about 2 minutes and my eyes were already starting to hurt and I was starting to get a headache. With all the pixellation behind the words and everything in the game being a different color it kinda made my vision go blurry and have me a headache. Although I like the classics this just isn't the best one.<br /><br />If you're a person that is affected by neon colors flashing constantly then I suggest you skip it. If that's not a problem for you then be my guest and go ahead and download it cuz you will enjoy the classic.<br /><br />The reason for the 3 stars is cuz it have me headaches, and made my eyes hurt. Hope this helps.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|So glad I decided to try reading these books. Couldn't put them down! Will definitely be reading them again soon!
B000FA675C|5.0|Controversies aside, this book is amazing. The puzzles inside of puzzles gripped my mind with awe, while the dramatic action scenes thrilled me through and through. This was a good read.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Amazing,exciting,suspense,thrilling, I would go half way across the world to get this awesome book should get it to. I mean this thing is incredibly awesome
B004LP3AYI|3.0|I really enjoy the diversity and imagination pumped into Goodkind's books but at this point in his career I feel like he's really trying to learn how to narrate a good story.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I have yet to read it .became interested in this when I herd that Chris was kill trying to help a fellow solider in need.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I love this game for its take on Space Invaders.  That game is a classic and this stands on its own for honoring and yet greatly setting itself apart.  Fun game well worth the purchase.
1616550414|5.0|Bought this book for my grandson who is a gamer and Zelda fan. He loved this book! Made a great birthday gift for him.
1878424114|4.0|probably not for readers who cant apply basic concepts<br />came in good condition<br />and i will read and re-read many times
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This is amazing. The Blu-ray technology really makes these old films stand out. I have never been happier with a film selection.
B007REV4YI|4.0|i wasn't an a new bond fan. But I loved the way they rebooted the franchise. I am really looking forward to next movie. would definitely recommend to anyone that enjoys espionage/spy flicks. Allot of action and great storyline.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book was well  thought out and would appeal to a large audience. I could relate to many of the 80's references but knowledge of that time is not necessary to enjoy the book.  It was very easy to get caught up in the characters and feel their personalities. Bravo! Can't wait for a movie.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I was expecting crap ..I received great. What a cool unique spin on a simple retro game. Play is easy, addiction factor huge
B0041D843M|5.0|This book gives me the answers I've been searching for, why is cancer so rampant, why is obesity such a problem, why does our generation have so much heart disease and diabetes when our grandparents ate rich foods and didn't.  Highly recommend this book.
B005QUQP76|4.0|Pros: mouse is comfortable, well balanced, feature rich, and precise.<br /><br />Cons: software is difficult to use (no tool-tips, unintuitive), had to search online for drivers.<br /><br />All told, the mouse is fantastic and does exactly what I want it to. I had to fiddle around with it for around a half an hour to figure out how to bind something to the thumb button (sniper button). Eventually I had to make it a keybind to the \ key, and then turn on hardware playback to get anything to recognize it. This process would have been much less frustrating if there were some sort of tool-tip or useful software guide for the program.<br /><br />I would recommend this mouse to a friend with the caveat that I show them how to use the software properly.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Great app!  I thought it would be too similar to Bejeweled to be fresh or interesting.  I could not have been more wrong!  This game was a wonderful surprise. So glad I downloaded this game.
1616550414|5.0|One of The Best Art book i ever read, Binding was good, presentation is beautiful lot of sketches and background story in it, it's cheap too... highly recommended
B000ICRKLM|5.0|Season three delivers more great story lines, excellent character development, and a few unexpected events.  I thought season one got off to a slow start but finished strong.  Season two was great from start to finish.  Season three is the best so far!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this whole series.  I enjoyed how far the character came by the end.  I especially enjoyed to glimpse of them settled at the end.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is actually as good as everyone says it is.  The graphics are right on par to set you back to the 80's. Plus the game play is fun and refreshing
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this whole series.  I enjoyed the character's relationship developement thru the story. I may actually read the whole series again.
B00A83075M|5.0|My grand daughter just loves this movie.<br />It shipped fast and service was great.<br />Made a little girl very happy.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a great start to the series.  It is a good thing that all 3 books were avaiable when I started reading them.  I could not put it down.
B00B49L7JY|4.0|I really enjoyed &#34;Searching for sugar man&#34;. I expected a bit more based on the critiques and reviews. It could be because I was already familiar with the general story and with Rodriguez' music. Definitely worth watching though.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It was a light and easy read.  Cute story.  I liked the dynamic between the couple.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|An interesting read, especially if death, or a family death, is in the offing (and most of us know someone!) I am only partway through, again, because I need the &#34;escapism&#34; of the spy and more fast-paced-type reads right now.  However, I have read a lot of NDE-type literature, and I find this book a bit different from most.  Very intriguing!
B007MDB548|5.0|my daughter loved this, i have a blue ray 3D dvd and to hear them laugh and enjoy it and play it over and over again every time her girl friends came was a joy, now i have to find the time to c it :)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!  Hope our world never, ever gets to this point, but it was extremely gripping to read about the way Katniss manages to negotiate her way through the difficulties of life in that perilous State...Having the entire Trilogy at hand is great, because one does not want to put it down until the entire situation is resolved for her, for Peta, for her Family, the Town, the entire Area, etc.
B00280LYIC|3.0|It is an amazing book so much energy the love between these characters are so sweet I just loved reading it I couldn't stop
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I kept wanting to go get my atlas out---the book was so informative and at the same time so interesting! But I couldn't put it down long enough to do any research---I'll get around to it sometime later!  The story was gripping---I always love John Corey---he is so irreverent!
B009KEN87O|5.0|This is an awesome &quot;back in time&quot; game. I love the power ups, wish space invades had them back then. It is very entertaining....
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I was riveted to this story! Chris was truly what represents a &#34;real&#34; American hero. He fought and died for his fellow warriors and for his country.
0060734191|5.0|These books are family favorites, shared by myself, my 22 yr old and my 12 yr old. As soon as we get done, we just start the set over. Very well structure fantasy world.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I love this CD - weather to jam out or have on as background music - it's something everyone will enjoy.
1400069807|2.0|I agree with the reviewers who said the book needed some severe editing. I guess it could have been slimmed down by at least a third by eliminating most of the instances of \\"...containing more than [insert number] times the maximum daily [salt/sugar/fat] intake recommended in government guidelines...\\"<br /><br />My biggest problem with the book, however, is that the author never once questions the validity of those guidelines, particularly as they pertain to fat. It seems that he never mentions saturated fat without adding, \\"the kind of fat associated with heart disease,\\" or \\"the kind of fat that raises cholesterol,\\" and as another reviewer pointed out, this supposed association seems destined for the dust heap of bad science. It's a pretty unforgivable omission considering that it was four years ago, in March 2009 that the findings of a study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition were widely publicized, the conclusion being, \\"...there is no significant evidence for concluding that dietary saturated fat is associated with an increased risk of CHD or CVD.\\"<br /><br />It seems strange that Moss doesn't merely accept the outdated conventional wisdom, but seems completely unaware of any controversy around it. There's one short quote from a food researcher pooh-poohing the Atkins diet and that's it. It seems a glaring omission from a book that aims to identify the causes of obesity, and to pin the blame on Big Food. I certainly don't think Big Food is blameless, but it's the recommendations of the USDA that keep people buying the reformulated \\"lower-fat-reduced-sodium-healthy-wholegrain\\" products.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I loved the magical circus, just loved it, enjoyed the writing and the story. But about 65% in I found the conclusion became a worry and then it was a disappointment. I felt the author lost some of the creativity in ending the story the way it was done. However, all in all it was a magical trip!
0307472841|3.0|A good story but waaaaaaaaaay too long.  Over and over, the characters come up with an interesting topic and then beat it to death.  The book would have been much better if the author had trimmed the excess verbiage by 5o or 60 per cent.  I get the feeling that the author's success has made him arrogant--that he feels that people will be fascinated by anything that drips from his pen (or computer keys), no matter how repetitious or irrelevant.  I had the same feeling after reading the highly unsatisfactory (and unnecessarily grim) ending of \\"The Troubled Man\\".
B00BCZU8WM|1.0|I have always enjoyed JT but it really is time to face it: this album is just a burnt out wreck of his former glory, a cobbled together string of songs reflecting an all too common theme... That greatness is not forever. JT has sadly lost innovation and electricity.<br /><br />Sorry, a purchase not recommended...
B00005Q45W|5.0|I am not a huge fan of duets, though Leonard does it about as well as anyone. I'm glad I have the album but I've got better ones than this.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|This movie is full of exciting action but the story line is too predictable and ending leaves the movie-goer hanging.  The whole point of the movie was to recover a list of secret agents.  Yet nothing is said or done in the ending about this all important list.
B002WIDRM6|1.0|Love the one title song that lured me into purchasing the album. The other stuff just takes up space. Should have downloaded the single.
B00AYATBP6|5.0|its as if genesis members and king crimson members are 20 years old again and went into the studio together to recoed a new album
B0067LY4WG|5.0|That's all you need to know. It's Leonard Cohen and well worth the cost. I never met a Cohen album I didn't like.
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|I love this cd package from one of our premier guitarist,So sad he died.I have not heard all of the cd's but what I have heard is great.Duane is an amazing guitar player any guitar olayers out there should pick this one up.
B0086700CM|5.0|Me,10,my brother,17,and my sister,14,all love this app.We were addicted the first time.(I am a directioner,for all the directioners out there:)
B001FB4VZS|5.0|Show is very addictive Delivery was on time  nicely packaged  ... Very happy customer. And yes I would recommend this to anyone that is interested  in Superman story  Thanks
B00BAYLRNO|2.0|The cinematography for this film is incredibly ugly. De-saturated colors with no detail in the lighter parts of the picture frame (= washed out), with a very ugly color scheme. If I can't even enjoy looking at a film, it's hard to give the content a decent grade. The \\"art\\" of cinematography is lost on the blind fool who photographed this. He made it all look fake & unrealistic. Hard to sympathize with people who live in that ugly world.
B001NLL93W|5.0|great book, great series!  I can't wait to read the next one.  Definitely a great fiction world to get lost into!
B009KEN87O|5.0|its a new and approved version of the early 80's Space Invader arcade game.  try it ...you will like it.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Great Movie. This was a very different role for Denzel. You arn't really sure if you love him or hate him ntil the end of the movie.
B00BUVPIRS|1.0|The game looks to be great, but as folks have reported in the play store the game does not load after the tutorial. Fix the game and I'll give it a proper review.<br /><br /> EDIT:  Although someone left a review saying the game has been patched... That's only true for the  Google  Play  Store. I  emailed the devs after the 1.21  patch was released  on the  Play  Store (which was the next day)  and they said  Amazon takes some time to approve updates for their  App  Store.  It's been almost a week now and I  STILL  can't  get past the first battle.<br /><br />Double Edit:<br />The developers got  back  to me  after I sent another email  after almost a month, and sent me the actual .apk  via  dropbox. I  can finally  play the  game as intended,  so five  stars to  Crescent Moon.<br /><br /> The  review will remain  one  star until  the  patch  is  uploaded  to  Amazon. I  don't  have to be \\"fair\\"  to  Amazon or the devs, I have to be fair to other consumers. If you have a Galaxy device, buy this from  the  Play  Store.  Given  Amazon's app  update  record,  I'll  be  deleting  the  Amazon  store  and  just  use  the  Play  Store.
B005ELQVGW|5.0|Her uniqueness always amazes me! This CD is worth the price, the wait and the anticipation! One of her best CD's yet!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|fun. its fun to build and also fight alot.  lots of different buildings and tanks and planes.  cant figure out the bounty coins tho.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I have really enjoyed playing this game!  it was fun reminded me of space invaders love it. cant wait to play it again
2070360024|3.0|I know this is a famous novel, an &#34;existential&#34; novel, as they say, though why they call it that, I don't know. The term &#34;existential&#34; as it applies to this work doesn't clarify anything, as far as I can tell. I ordered the novel and read it in French because I am teaching myself French. Now that I've read I, I'm satisfied that reading about the novel never compelled me to read it in English as &#34;literature.&#34; This is a depressing tale about a guy who seemingly sleep-walked through his mother's funeral without showing any emotion. Later, he unnecessarily walks a long way along a beach with a gun in his pocket that he took away from a friend, so the friend would not do anything foolish about a Arab who was threatening him. The protagonist then proceeds to go to find that Arab and shoots him, killing him. He s then arrested and, in the French manner of conducting an investigation and prosecution, he is extensively interrogated to find out if he has any compunction about killing the Arab or any extenuating circumstances. He turns out to be totally inept in protecting himself, and eventually gets convicted and sentenced to death mainly because he didn't show enough emotion at his mother's funeral. A pointless novel.
B005EGXNLS|4.0|Includes some interesting material about the way people lived at the time.  Appears to have been well researched.  One difficulty occurs with the Kindle version.  At the end of the book the historical notes are found.  I read the first page, reached the rate and tweet page then could page no further to finish reading the historical notes. At that point, the paging function began to take me in a circle.  One page of the historical notes, the rating page and repeat.  Found that by using the menu to reach the end of the book, I could then page back to the beginning of the historical notes.  By that method the Kindle allowed me to read the entire historical notation.
2253150711|3.0|As a novel, this book chronicles (autobiographically?) the difficulties the protagonist had as a Belgian trying to adjust (unsuccessfully, as it turns out) into the Japanese corporate culture. It reads like a recitation of &#34;what happened&#34; over the space of a year, and her inadvertent missteps caused by the fact that she was not brought up to understand the kabuki character of how to get along in a Japanese environment. Why the protagonist made herself endure the psychological abuse for an entire year is not clear.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book. I don't usually do teenage genre however first chapter took away the choice. I thoroughly enjoyed every word
B009KEN87O|4.0|Good game with different speeds to play to get you used to playing the game. Anyone can play this game.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|I received these three days ago. I purchased the purple for my hubby & the orange one for me. I opened the box but did not take them out of the plastic covering.  They appear 2 b made very well. The orange color is even prettier in person. I also like the purple color. Whatever material is being used to make these marware cases, appear 2 b leather. However it is not leather but it is not cheap looking.  I ordered these bcuz they had gone on sale. I just ordered the matching stylus (they r now on sale). The high cost of the S&H, practically depletes the sale prices. Oh well that is how the ball bounces. Now this is the kicker people, I have not purchased the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 as of yet. I will be purchasing a kindle for me & one for my hubby. Bcuz the accessories r on sale, it would b silly for me 2 pass up the good sale prices. All of this will be a surprise gift for my hubby. Hopefully I will be able 2 give him the Kindle along with all the accessories on father's day. I decided to go with this case after reading the reviews. I had initially considered the otterbox but the added weight was a sure turn off for me. No one complained of added weight with these.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Love retro games such as Space Invaders, Galaxian, Gyruss, Defender, etc and this one does an excellent job of living up to the play-ability of the old classics and the controls are fantastic. Normally the FAOTD go into a virtual closet never to be opened again, but this one is so good that it got me to write a review which I normally don't do.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|this was one of the best tv series i have ever seen. i couldn't wait to own it when it became available. as always, amazon had the best prices and the delivery was very quick. this is a must see for all horror fanatics! the storyline was so unique and keeps you on the edge of your seat. i looked forward to seeing it every week and did not want it to end. it was also nominated for 17 awards and was well deserving. i promise you will not be disappointed if you purchase this series.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|I'm having lots of fun. If you have a passing interest with matching tile games, you will like this one. It's fun to have a story theme. And the colors are bright and pretty.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is an amazing show!  It has great acting, wonderful costumes, and a bit of a history lesson mixed in. Highly recommended!
0345529057|5.0|These books were totally worth every penny! Came in a nice sturdy box and everything so they don't take up so much space!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Yeah, it's Space Invaders, but it's quite enjoyable! The power-ups are fun without being &quot;game breakers&quot;, the sound effects are gratifying (especially the level complete chime), and the enemies are refreshingly varied. You can tell a lot of love was put into this game.<br /><br />My only real complaint is the background music. It sounds a little muddy, and it's a little busy. Repetitious music in these sorts of games thrive on simplicity and a catchy baseline tune or segment. That's a VERY minor complaint though. Glad I snagged it as a free app, but I'd gladly pay the very specific and somewhat odd price they ask!
B00BWJ6JO4|5.0|this movie was a fantastic movie to watch and i would recommned it to anyone. plus i love amazon and knew that the product that i ordered would be great. :)
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I belong to a book club and we all loved this - sad ending but realistic today in today's world.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read the first half of this book on Kindle and whispersynced with audible to listen to the second half. It was so great I finished in less than one day! It was a great finish to the series!
B003QS9WIE|5.0|I loved the movie! The actors, the plot, the cool science/magic mix. It was a great movie and I've seen it multiple times since the first rental.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the first-ever and very cool game in the entire Universe. I don't know how anyone can not be at all in love with this app.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Wow, what can you say or can't say about this movie.  It is one of the finest experiences I have ever had.  I pirated a copy, i do that to see movies to decide if they are worth purchase.  I just keep seeing new things every time about how the characters connect to eachother and what's happening in the story.  I am in awe of these directors and of course the writer of the original novel.  So many lovely flavors and there's something for everyone.  Not sure what else to say.  As many times as I have rewatched it, I could not be more excited to purchase it for the big screen (my tv).  This is a new movie for a new kind of audience, a sharper and more discerning crowd.  If you are a common snowflake ;P, you'll notice references to reincarnation and some wonderful imagery, but there is just so much going on beneath the surface, just on the movement of the story alone.  If you are sharp enough to see it, you are either long used to circles related to the subject of spirits, karmas etc., or you are just very sharp, and probably barely fit in with your peers.  I am going to watch it again right now, and couldn't be happier to support the filmmakers when it comes out.
B000002AH7|5.0|What you should expect from Miles Davis.  I bought this with Concierto de Aranjuez and enjoy listening to both.  This CD has a b-side for me.
B008D36INE|2.0|I thought this movie would be great to watch.  After all it did have Rachel Weisz.  Movie starts off slow and continues slowly.  Its hard to follow and understand what is going on.  The movie switches back and forth from the past to the present.  Finally when you know whats going the love story isn't there.  Weisz pathetic attempt to keep her lover fails.  No sense at all with what she does.  Pathetic ending.  I say good riddance.
B0042RUMG4|5.0|I loved this album because it was everything you would expect from a Kanye West album and more. This is my everyday album I listen to.
B009O07NDY|5.0|Howard Shore has done it again!  Super music brings the movie visuals rushing back!<br />I highly rate it, and enjoy listening to it.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|Having read all the other books in the Camel Club series I was looking forward to another. &#34;Hell's Corner&#34; did not disappoint! Twists and turns enough to keep me reading into the wee hours. Highly recommend!
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This book had everything it needed! I love it! Sara Shepard has done it again. PLL ROCKS!<br />Keep on writing!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is so fun! I love I  so much, every time I go on my kindle I play it. I have gotten far In the game but it still rocks!!!!!!!!!!!
B009KEN87O|4.0|This is great! A lot like old arcade games Galaga an Galaxian. I get the old school graphics; but on my tablet it's really pixelated. Think they could've done a little better in that regard without affecting the classic look of the game. All in all a fun waste of time!
B006RJTEIC|5.0|That's saying a lot.  The 70s in general had many crazy movies.  Logan's Run had the sci fi thing going on.  It could've leaned into the horror genre too.  In fact maybe it should have.  Regardless, it's a great trippy rendition of the future a la 1976.  Its take on the post apocalyptic nirvana gone wrong has been looked at and tried again and again.  But this is the king.  It streamed beautifully from Amazon to my xbox360.  Flawless!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the most coolest game in the freaking world although I can't get a bucket of water or make a nether and can't craft or put my things in a chest
B005SEYOXW|5.0|It's a crime that this show barley survived a season.  We have the movie to wrap thing up but I'm willing to bet many seasons could produce many unique and interesting stories.  If you are a sci fi fan and a western fan you and you have never seen Firefly, you must remedy that immediately.  On that note the streaming quality from Amazon to my xbox360 was perfect!
B00BF11STU|5.0|I usually just rent movies, but this will be one of the few that I will purchase.  The opening recording of the 911 calls during the attack Sept. 11th attacks sets the tone and prepares the viewer for the following torture scenes.  I've always remained steadfastly opposed to ANY torture of detainee, this movie changed my mind.<br />The acting is SUPERB!<br />I'm usually the type of viewer that can predict (sometimes saying lines at the same time as the actor) what will happen next, but I didn't have that capability during this movie.<br />It is BY FAR one of the BEST movies I've ever watched!!!
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|This set is a good set by itself,  with the piece of the wall, new horse, catapult and a good number of minifigures. But it also goes as an addition to the bigger set of Helm's deep battle.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like it, because it's very organized and it gives me the opportunity to read the word in other languages.
B004Y1QKKK|5.0|We all have heard of the various quotes that have made Wilde so famous, but it is not until you read his whole work that you realize that whilst Oscar recognized his own brilliance he came to realize that hubris has great limitations and how even a brilliant person such as himself can have serious and fundamental flaws.  In De Profundis the character of Bozie is revealed as one that a psychologist would probably define as borderline personality disorder or at least histrionic, yet at the end Oscar does not blame Bozie, but accepts his fate as of his own making which of course ultimately it was.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. Now I can play anytime I have a few extra minutes. I love this free version.
0307744434|1.0|I had high expectations for this book and was greatly disappointed. I honestly don't understand why so many people like it. It was utterly boring and way too much description with very little plot. I understand that it's suppose to make you feel as if you were truly visiting the circus, but I feel as if the author was using excessive descriptions to compensate for very little plot. The introduction of random characters got a bit too ridiculous for me. I found no love between Celia and Marco, it wasn't as well developed as I was hoping it'd be. Overall, I felt this book was a waste of time I'll never get back.
0688156819|5.0|It's exactly what I expected from Tim Burton!  I love it!  It's a great pick me up for a bad day!
B007IK44CK|5.0|Highly enjoyed this movie; the action set pieces are some of the best I've ever seen and the making of features provide a glimpse as to how they made the stunts look so believable. The making of was almost as entertaining and exciting as the film itself in many ways. I remember very little of the previous Mission Impossible films but luckily, like James Bond films, MI doesn't require a lot of knowledge of the previous films to follow the story and become invested. Great action flick.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book intrigues because I'm kind of a sucker for the psychological aspect of this novel. I'm very curious to how the author plays this whole whole story out. While reading this book I came to the realization that this kind of story is one of the prime reason why so many women date \\"the twisted, mysterious, bad boy\\" hoping that they would be \\"special\\" enough to make him do a 180 degree turn with his life decisions....but sadly, in reality, very few are that \\"special\\"
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game. Play it everyday. I haven't had any problems with the way it functions. Recommend it!<br />I also use this same app on my Samsung Stratosphere with equally good results.
B00AA0TZTW|3.0|No a bad album but certainly not an Electric Lady Land. But it's still better than 95% of rock music coming out today.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|One of the best books ever.  I couldn't wait for the sequel and it was one of the best books that I have read in awhile.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I'm not a regular reader of the suspense/psychological thriller genre so how much I enjoyed Into the Darkest Corner snuck up on me and surprised me. Told in two timelines - a before and after - that expertly coil together building a paranoid tension throughout the story even though you know what's unfolding. In one timeline, we meet Cathy dealing with crippling OCD/PTSD, gun shy of any relationships, until she meets her charming, new upstairs neighbor and begins inching her way out from the protective bubble she's wrapped herself in. In the other timeline, we meet a vivacious, girl about town, Catherine that meets the handsome and charming Lee...until he's not. And then, he's really, really not. Elizabeth Haynes does a fantastic job of showing how we can ignore and dismiss our instincts (particularly under the weight of our own and our friends expectations of 'how it should be'), and step-by-slow step find ourselves in dangerous and nearly fatal circumstances and be completely lost as to how you get there until you look back with clear eyes.<br /><br />The development of the character Cathy was interesting in both timelines. In the beginning of both, I found her to be quite alienating and wasn't sure if I would be able to hook into her character. As I turned each page and came to know her and her experience, I really came to love the character and exulted in her successes, dismayed in her setbacks, and horrified in her terrors.<br /><br />Definitely recommend!
B007I1TFK0|5.0|The picture is spectacular and the sound is even better! Well worth upgrading from the DVD to Blu-ray. It's a region free Blu-ray. Works fine on my Australian player. On the back cover it has all regions listed.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I watched season1,but didn't have the chance to watch season 2.When I saw I could get season 2 on dvd I ordered it.Love the shows.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I wanted to watch this movie the other night so I purchased it on amazon.  I really liked it. Even my husband and kids watched it with me.  It is very action packed and the storyline is fun.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|One of the best movies I've watched in the last 2 years.  I would highly recommend this (and have!) to anyone that thinks life needs to be ordinary - it doesn't - and this true story is the best illustration of that.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I've seen John Carter on cable several times and thought it might be fun in 3D.  It was.  Another major benefit were the extras that provided lots of scenes of the making of the movie and what it took to bring this amazing story to the big screen.  The 3D effects are very good, amazing since as I understand it, it was not originally shot in 3D.
1442419814|5.0|I will say that these set of books have lead me back to reading about the strange and not normal cop books.  I read a book a week because of the work commute and have found that I was getting bored with the same store line girl gets killed cops find the bad person end of book.  Now that I have started to read books like these fantasy, I have been reading a book every few days and constantly buy series and find that at least with a series of books I get more of the story and not just one book.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Very gripping - definite page turner.  Haynes was able to make you feel like this could be your friend or neighbor.  Well written and I would recommend it.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|One of my favorite movies I can not wait for the sequal to be relased and I can see how they write the next screen play.  I have actually read the book set twice now.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|This is a very interesting continuation of the Phantom of the Opera tale.<br />The music is an interesting update from the operatic style of the original to a unique blend of the original melodies and rock undertones.<br /><br />The plot is slightly disappointing and can drag at times, but the music alone makes it all worth it.
B00942Y94I|4.0|I was turned off by all the negative things I heard about these movies so I never watched them until this past month (February) and found that I liked the movies and read the books and feel in love with the characters all over again.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I borrowed the first book in this series (this one) a few weeks ago and wound up coming back the whole series.<br />Anyone who likes fantasy with a little romance will definitely enjoy this series.
B004NSULHM|3.0|I have listened to this album multiple times in the hope that it would grow on me more with additional exposure, but I have to be honest that of the Radiohead albums that I own, this one is probably my least favorite.  The album has a minimalist almost Krautrock feel featuring an extensive amount of looping and aural soundscapes.  I have nothing against using loops in modern music, but the technique is really taken to extremes here.  For me the best songs on the album are \\"Give Up The Ghost\\" and \\"Codex\\", but other than that I find the rest of the material to just not strike me artistically.  I have to give these guys props in that they do what they want, and are not afraid to experiment, but I find this album much less digestible than what has come before.  Even earlier experimental works such as \\"Kid A\\" or \\"Amnesiac\\" seemed to have more to keep my interest than this material.  Maybe I am being too harsh and I am not really saying that this is a bad album, but it is not grabbing me in a way that makes me want to keep it in heavy rotation.
B000E2AZ2C|1.0|This DVD was not narrated as the original theatrical version was.  I bought it to replace the tape I had that was dying.  I have never heard back from the company and since I was on the road at the time I could not follow up on the product replacement.  The product I received was the Director's Cut not what I ordered.<br /><br />Gary G. Moore<br />g4moore@sbcglobal.net

B001NLKT60|5.0|Fabulous book!!  Dragon ratio was better but now off to read the hornet nest!!!!!!!!!!  Sorry story had to die great storyteller
B0074VA2T2|3.0|I expected the book, animated, with mini games interspersed. My wife was real excited...and then there were simple counting games ... but no animation to make it interesting for the kids. No references to the book except for static drawings of a little caterpillar, and references to the caterpillar in the text.  When you<br />touch the fruit or whatever to eat it, a voice counts &quot;one lemon&quot;, &ldquo;two lemons&quot; but all that happens to indicate that the fruit is eaten is that a tiny circle is punched out..Level 5 is a Timed level, but I could not tell if I had achieved the goal result. We expected more. I will try it on my 3 year old grandbaby, and see if it holds her interest. I do not expect it to, but if it does, I will amend the review. I got it on free app day. If I had paid for it, I would have felt ripped off.
B002KT3XH6|5.0|Easy to read compare to other histories with personal insights defending any points she thought needed extra explanation. Very good read will read more of her works.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is hands down MUST read book. Once you get into the characters , it's like you're part of the story.
B009KEN87O|5.0|this is like an arcade game i played as a kid. great fun. fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen ninteen words.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|All the discs worked. That 's all I needed to know.  Now we can make some room on the DVR!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved it! Can't wait to hear Travis' side of the story when it comes out next month. very, very, good
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so much fun!  We love taking care of our horse & entering in the competitions. We  love scratching her nose :) Someday we hope to save up enough to get a unicorn. We are 10 years old & think if you like horses, you will love this game too.<br /><br />UPDATE July 2013: From the adult standpoint. This app frequently freezes on the Kindle Fire HD with little or no warning. The only way to get out of the app when it has frozen is to do a cold shut down of the device. Customer service is rather slow in responding to issues and sometimes takes over a week to get any response at all. I'll let the kids keep the stars but I would probably drop it by 1-2 stars
B001NLKXK2|4.0|Alice's story was a, well written, heart wrenching  insight into the mind of an Alzheimer's patient. I was able to feel the pain of Alice, her husband, and her children.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This is a nice game to play when you want to relax or clear your mind.  Very basic strategy: eat the smaller blobs, run from the bigger ones.  But running uses mass, if you chase a target too long you may suddenly find yourself on the dinner menu.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|I try to download something and it wont download because I have to much space. so I delete almost everything and it still doesn't work. its a terrible piece of crape that has no brain!!!!!!!!
B008IZYW3U|5.0|Freddy Mercury had a wonderful talent and recognized the talents of others in various genres.  If you appreciate eclectic music, this CD is for you.
1616550414|5.0|Honestly, I haven't read this whole book - I've just skimmed through it as I'm currently playing Skyward Sword right now. I am very much looking forward to delving deeper into this book once I've finished Skyward Sword. The art looks great and the whole book is very high quality. Definitely a great value from Amazon.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We love this series. I watch this with my 23 year old daughter. The acting is great and the costumes are beautiful. Location is just beautiful to look at. We love this series. Thanks
B00BF11STU|5.0|I thought it lived up to the hype - mostly excellent acting and writing. I believe the film doesn't take a stance politically - it's more of a personal story than a statement film.
B0001WDAX6|5.0|Thanks, good response time, the product was just exactly what I expected and I am truly satisfied with it, Thanks again
B0091THDOM|3.0|it is so tight so you cant puh the iPhone in or take it out in the first few weeks.<br />it is also doesnt provide fuul protection since the case needs another 2 milimiters for the iPhone to be completely in.<br />it is very hard to get the iPhon out.<br />sometimes the strings releases.
B005LAII8A|5.0|This movie may be creepy but nothing about the seller is. This was sent in a timely manner and arrived in perfect shape. I enjoyed the movie though it is not an upbeat film by any means (not that I expected it to be)!
B00AK0X5VQ|2.0|How to play would be good.  How to back up would help.<br />What the point of it is would be even better.<br />I think it would be a great game, if there was some information.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|not Much else to say. they kept the stuff that worked and changed the stuff that didn't.  the additional tweaks are fun.
0062014536|2.0|The Following Contains Spoilers so proceed with CAUTION...<br />I am DISAPPOINTED! And a little bit angry about the time invested.  Let's first go with the obvious problem here.  How can you spend all of Delirium making us fall in love with Alex and then all of Pandemonium making us fall in love with Julian, and then barley make them part of Requiem?  This was allegedly a story championing love above all else and there was almost no \\"love\\"  throughout the full story.  The entire plot revolves around emotional teenagers that have never seen positive examples of love and are in a high stress survival situations.  And SOMEHOW they seem to keep it together through most of the story with only a few small conflicts, all the while a love triangle is the white elephant in the camp (read with thick sarcasm).  Seriously?  I do not care if you were Team Alex or Team Julian, we all went into Requiem Team \\"Someone\\" and both of us are left deflated and wondering.  And I will tell you who's team on am not on, Lena's.  Yeah, yeah, yeah she is an important part of the resistance and can contribute to the group, but she just comes off selfish and noncommittal!  If \\"love\\" was the way she played it, I'd consider it a disease too.<br />And the ending!?  Was that the end or did the last chapter get left out?  We know nothing about no one and then you turn the page and are at least hoping for an epilogue but only get acknowledgments!  What?  Was this a \\"choose your own ending\\" story from the 80's?  Well, I will tell you what I choose!  That BOTH Alex and Julian, who are dreamy and strong and sensitive and lovable in their own unique ways, each find a new love and leave Lena in the dust and rubble of that torn down wall.  Think about it.  There has to be uncured girls running all over the place just waiting to love and be loved in return.<br />And why use the POV's from Lena and Hana?  Sure, the obvious reason was because this was not a story about love being brought back into a world of coldness and calculation, but is was a story of a cold and calculated war.  But picture it... A story where two opposing sides battle for what they think is good and right for the overall betterment of society as told from the POV's of two boys in love with one girl, each attempting to remain in control of their feelings all the while struggling to show those in power that love IS good even though it can make you so desperate at times.<br />All in all, this seemed to me like it was book 3 of a series other then Requiem from the Delirium Trilogy by Lauren Oliver.oldness and calculation, but is was a story of a cold and calculated war.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Catches you from the first page- interesting twists. Characters well developed. Good beach read for this summer. Will look for other books by Ms Hoover
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Who needs a reality show when you have Downton Abbey.  Each character is it's own person and adds to the total picture.  I just wish there were more episodes each season.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I think there is an update to this product available, but this works for me. I had trouble installing it, but I guess I wasn't reading the directions correctly. Nice for printing pictures I take my Kindle Fire.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this novel, since I was unfamiliar with the author and not expecting much.  It is well-written and definitely a thriller.  She keeps you hooked until the end!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I absolutely love the whole idea/concept of this series/story line. All the characters have become my favorite. I just don't have one. But i especially love The Huntsman, Emma, Bella, Henry and Mr. Gold/Rumplestilskin. I hope it continues for many many seasons/years. I would recommend this show to all people who love fairy tales and magic.
B00B6LS9HS|5.0|Listen it's pretty cut and dried, If you thought the first W.E.T. album was good or even great as I did this ones better! We finally get to hear Eric Martensons fantastic voice and a perfect match with JSS. I could not be more pleased with every aspect of this album, from the song writing to the excellent guitar work to the great hooks, you will love this album if youliked the first one, period.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|so easy to use... download and cloud program is nice! I love the preview feature however I wish the previews were a bit longer.

B001NPDCFQ|5.0|Excellent movie and also comes with extra features and documentaries and a beautiful booklet  excellent Blu-ray  a must for all fans
B00005NB0H|5.0|I had the LP back in the 70's, and I loved it then.  The extra tracks are great, the sound quality is great, and I haven't taken it out of the CD player since it arrived.  In my opinion, these guys were simply incredible at the time when this was recorded; it is raw and loud and amazing!  At times it sounds almost as if Pete, John and Keith are playing different songs, yet it all comes together with such power and feeling.  And Roger's voice is one of the best rock voices that I know of.  I wish this were a video so that I could see him throwing that microphone around...the guy is super-cool!  What an amazing band and an amazing album!!  There never was and never will be another band like the original Who...long live the WHO!!!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Ok it has language blood and Gore but in multiplayer no language blood or Gore. I suggest just play multiplayer
0670026603|5.0|I thought it was very well written, a disturbing story, but a subject that many have to deal with in their lifetime.  A very good story about a really wonderful friendship between two people who end up helping each other in the &#34;end&#34;.  I will definitely read more by Jojo Moyes.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Saw the movie first. Didn't understand a lot of it. Got book and the book is such a good read. Need to get 2nd book before movie comes out.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|The movie was okay. I am glad I did not go to the theater and pay full price. It was a little disturbing.  I understand the main character was a vampire and they drink blood but it was a little hard to cheer for someone (something?)  that killed about 15 innocent people.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun! It's hard not to play it! In my free time I like to play this game! It looks really real. I feel like I'm actually running from a \\"cop\\"'

B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This is a relevant subject and was well written and an easy read.  Quite emotionally absorbing and<br />have no hesitation recommending it
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|Great book loved it. I could not put it down, I read it in 3 days with 2 children and working full time.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I can not get the new virus and would like to know so i can play it please thank you
B00AAX68HG|3.0|I like this game but sometimes it is so hard.  If you like a fun and extra challenging game (but still fun) then this is the game for you.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Denzel is incredible... He cannot go wrong on screen and this movie demonstrates that. Fantastic movie with characters portrayed brilliantly.... Masterpiece
B004V9MU86|5.0|One of my favourite reads ever, even though the initial pages were confusing, as the book thief's watcher introduces himself.  Don't give up though, or you will miss a tragic yet compelling story, set during the horror years of the second world war.  One small girl, taken into a dreadfully poor family brings hope, friendship and humanity into a community bereft and living in constant fear.<br />Marcus Zusak's writing is superb.  Highly recommended.
0788859544|5.0|I have always loved The Little Mermaid! Since I was a little girl, I've watched it. My youngest son seen a comericial on tv for movie and begged me for it, ecspecially after I told him it was my favorite. Lol Anyways I searched all over my town for it, even looked in a couple close by towns. Couldn't find it anywhere. Then I remembered Amazon! They got it to me right before his birthday! Love it!!
B0063M22QO|4.0|This game is fun &amp; easy. I recommend it to those who like symbol matching. I have only played the Classic game but look forward to the other games.
B00B1E6FF8|2.0|If you want to get your USA rah-rah on, watch Argo.  Zero Dark Thirty emphasizes the zero.  First, it just plain hard to believe that with all the resources and billions available to the CIA, it took 10 years to find and kill Bin Laden. Then they \\"find\\" him in a great big obvious fortress in Pakistan with barb wire on the walls after spending years torturing miscellaneous persons to get intel.  (The torture scenes are the grittiest and most gripping parts of the movie and we Americans hate to think we employ those methods.  That is also the biggest controversy about the film.)<br />Why not just fly around Pakistan and stake out all the suspicious fortresses first.  The \\"fortress\\" has only 3 men in it, only one of whom is armed,Bin Laden's son and UBL himself..... and about two dozen women and kids.  No disrespect to the Navy Seals.  They are highly skilled and do as told with incalculable bravery.  I thought the movie made them look bumbling. Wouldn't there have been a big effort to catch UBL alive? Noooooo, they run in the room and blow half his face off.  I don't believe the \\"official\\" version of this story and the movie made the events look even more ridiculous.<br /><br />.<br />I find all  the \\"facts\\" about Bin Laden's death dubious, none more so than his burial at sea.  No photos. Rush rush and hush hush.  Who was that man in the body bag?<br /><br />  Normally, a movie fictionalizing an actual event has the leeway to add some excitement. This version just drags as did the 10 year hunt for Bin Laden.  Chastain mostly appears in multiple scenes staring at a computer and nibbling snacks....for 10 years!  Boring.  Occasionally she gets to have a little hissy fit and drop the f-bomb.  Her character is not rounded out at all in that 10 years and of course she never ages.  Basically the script and the directing is very second-rate.  I hope some day the truth comes out. Personally, I think Bin Laden died in a cave years ago and our leaders know it.
B0097UO87U|5.0|ELO, WILBURY's mix applied to musical standards. Mr Lynne is a brilliant producer as well as recording artist, sadly we don't get as much product from him nowadays. I don't blame him, he could retire from everything, but I feel we fans could have so much more from him.<br />I am pleased to see he is to release a couple of albums in April, and will be online looking for them.<br />Long Wave is a varied collection that covers differing styles, but Mr Lynne does an excellent job with them all. i would recommend this collection to everybody, to let them hear some great old standards again, and also to showcase Jeff Lynne's skills.<br />Hope he does more like this.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|It's Game of Thrones, in all it's high definition glory...<br /><br />good extras as well so as a fan of the show.... I am well pleased!
B0022W6L6G|4.0|A great collection of hits, if you aren't sure about the Band, this album will show you why they are Icons. 16 tracks with musical content that can make you smile, solid bass drum, whimsical guitar, and great vocals, Listen to the previews, purchase and enjoy.<br />I repurchased this album because when I bought a new computer and transferred my music, for some reason, it didn't transfer, then said I didn't hold a license, so it was a no brainer when it came to buying some new stuff, Fleetwood Mac was first choice.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Highly recommend it. Put it into my car system and it just took me away. Amazing CD ; his voice is so amazing.
B001GUXJQA|2.0|I like to look forward to getting into bed and reading a novel.  With this one, I did not look forward to getting into bed.  At least not for the purpose of reading.  Try some of the other Connolly books instead.
B009KEN87O|4.0|like the old arcade games but with a new twist and flare. cool retro graphics. keeps it simple for ole guys like me.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|It was fun reading, keeping up with the family at Downton Abbey. I really enjoyed the series..  I look forward to Series 4.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|Another great album from Clutch. Great guitar,great drums,and great vocals!. The boys really lay the heavy grooves down on this one. Great from start to finish.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|very affordable and works for filming rolling fisheye. If you need a much less expensive alternative to a easyhandle this is your best bet. camcaddies are the same exact thing for more money.
B000002NAK|5.0|such a great movie....music........the true story of the rise of evita. madonna's best acting performance!!!!  shows why she won the golden globe for BEST actress!!!!!!!!!
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I was sucked into this book, could not put it down. It was a great read, and never wanted to stop reading. I did not agree nor care for the ending. Left me wanting more, an explanation.
B000002J0N|5.0|If you are a fan of CSN this is a must have.  I had to search high and low for it having worn out my poor little cassette tape.  It sounds so much richer on CD.  This is a drawback to the times when you sat and listened to music and didn't multitask, it is simply a wonderful lyrical vacation.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Held my attention as long as taught me a lot about a generation before mine. The Adventure has been amazing.
B00BRR66SA|3.0|Not entirely thrilled with this album as it seems to have a focus on slow(er) love jams and not the upbeat dance tracks that he is better known for.  The album starts out fast and then seems to progressively apply the brakes.  Buy the first three tracks if you want what you know JT for.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I love this case! I'm usually a pink girl but for some reason, this nice bright orange color popped out at me and i love it!! The case is sturdy and protects my kindle. The stand works very well too. i have absolutely no complaints about this case, i'm so glad i got it! :)
B009KEN87O|5.0|great game only writing a review so it will stop asking game play is good graphics are also good seems to get harder

B0050DIWFC|5.0|An excellently written suspense novel that leaves you hanging to the end, &#34;Defending Jacob&#34; is much more.  The fictionalized account of a young Jewish boy, the son of a prosecuting attorney, from an upscale community who is accused of murdering a classmate, &#34;:Defending Jacob&#34; forces you to confront your own moral choices.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Downloaded to my Kindle.  Loved the book.  Will order more as able.  **** **** ** ** ** ** ** **
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I would technically give it a five stars because it was so funny!<br /> That was sure that Greg had so many embarrassing moments including the birthday party. DON'T GIVE up on getting revenge of your brother. That's how I feel about mine.Well, you've conquered it or as known as embarrassing moments
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I was a little worried that I wouldn't like this book given that there are such mixed reviews and it's pretty much impossible to follow Storm of Swords with something better. That book is the most epic book ever. However, I read through this book faster than any of the previous three. I really enjoyed it. Now it doesn't have huge battle scenes and plot twists, but it moves the story along and builds on characters that we didn't get to know that well in the past three, like Jaimie, Brienne, Sansa, and Cersei. Okay, so there's really no Danaerys, Jon, or Tyrion, and little of Arya, but George RR Martin created a world so vast with so many intricate and important characters that it's almost necessary to write a book like this. Like I said, it's a book that helps fill in pieces to the vast world and story. It only adds on to the awesomeness that is Song of Ice and Fire.
0307592731|5.0|I loved this book and could hardly put it down, made me wish I was on the trail with her.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|It is almost painful to experience the frustration, pain and endless disappointment the main characters face as the world moves into and out of WW II. The writing is concise and vivid which brings to life in few words the experiences of the the main characters who are a diverse set of ,German, British and American unique personalities. Can't wait for the next book in this trilogy.<br />.
B00ARIO7PO|5.0|The cd met all my expectations and it is a welcome addition to my collection.<br />An interesting selection of compositions to put on a single album.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This was an amazing story what an amazing story, and what an unexpected ending. The scenery and CF effects were also amazing. A+++ movie
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|The Walking Dead is a great series. The second season is so intense and the zombie limited edition is a perfect item for every WD lover. Also the package, shipping rates and delivery time to Italy was very reasonable.
B00006LLLN|5.0|These CD's are great!  The quality of the sound is crystal clear and Alison Krauss and Union Station in concert are awesome!
B008YBOGVG|5.0|Oh boy am I glad I bought this deluxe edition of this incredible album. Never before has it sounded so good as with this crisp and well balanced remastered version... and that's just half the surprise of this package. This classic album just sparkles and shines now, it's full of hard rocking gems where the guitars duel and tango with lashings of Stevie Winwood keyboards fattening up the driving and hypnotic grooves... and Marianne's voice is just spectacular.<br /><br />And to qualify the deluxe tag is the \\"lost\\" original mixes of Broken English without Stevie Winwood on keyboards.It's just the band and Marianne and boy do they sound good on this version. I've listened to both a few times now and I'm leaning more toward the original version. Without the added keyboards of Winwood the band sounds sharper and has more of a live feel to it and it's very very good.<br /><br />It's nice to see Sister Morphine included and the other versions of BE and WYDI have their merit I suppose for inclusion. There is a great video as well of three songs in this package of pure rock culture. The last track on the album is Why'd Ya Do It and was banned in many countries for being too in your face, based on a poem, it is graphic and real as you can get your rock'n'roll. This deluxe package classic is worth every cent you pay for it and more.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|i was so exited to read his after book one. It was so disappointing I coundn't even finish it. I kept reading hoping things would get interesting and it just became more and more mushy lovey stupid chick drivel. Shame on the author for tempting us with a hot first book and turning it into your milky whiteness ughhhhh never again and certainly no book three
B005H9B44A|4.0|Thor was OK. I happy I did not spend money to see it. For free it's good, nothing special or great about it.
B001BZRUR4|5.0|Very interesting ending. Very good plot twists and weird things that worked. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a good laugh.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I'll leave the review of the book up to reader. As for the digital copy for the kindle fire hd, the bookmarking didn't work. Also finding a page was miserable. Maybe I missed something about how to search for a page.  At the bottom of the page, they all say 694 of 694.  Minor detail I guess.  Just a personal preference, I would have appreciated it if the percentage complete was calculated by book and not across the entire fours books in this package.
B007SGM084|5.0|Ugh, I am so depressed I have finished the series. Hot, funny, suspenseful. I am definitely in love with Mr. Christian Grey.
0525478817|5.0|John Green's latest New York Times bestseller \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" doesn't disappoint those of us who have come to adore his fast-paced witticisms and charming insights into the minds of today's youth. The storyline follows a teenage Hazel Grace as she battles thyroid cancer, makes new friends and becomes ensnared with Augustus Waters. Augustus (who is remission) meets Hazel at a support group helps her achieve her dream of meeting her idol, an author by the name of Peter Von Houten. While reading you are hoping for a happy ending even though you can feel the storm cloud lurking above your head and the heartbreak approaching. I feel as though I can say with certainty that \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" is the most heart wrenching love story in modern young adult literature. Despite that Green manages to help the reader look past the heartbreak and realism though-out the journey and fall in love with the characters even when we know it's doomed. In today's current literary climate of sparkly vampires and love struck zombie's Green writes a Young Adult novel that reaches into the human consciousness as the characters' ponder their own mortality and the realistic chances of surviving cancer. He makes the reader deliberate on life's big questions, feel gripping emotions and laugh through the sadness. This is the kind of novel that can inspire young adult's and change the face of YA literature.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|This album is like a fresh breath of new air I can see why he waited so long to drop an album it's just so unique and different if you like neo soul and rnb and pop you'll love this cd
0800141849|5.0|This will be a classic some day - like those old black and white movies we watch over and over.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Needed an option for Internet access without using wifi. This made it easy to connect at a client location that does not allow wifi.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Very fun game the graphics awsome, enjoyed the story and worked well with the kindle<br />Would recommend to other hidden object lover.
B00B99KJR0|1.0|I installed it on my Kindle Fire and played it one time, then it wouldn't open the next time I wanted to play. so I tried taking it off my Kindle and reinstalling it but now it won't install at all. It just takes me to the product page. Very frustrating!
B005LAIIFS|5.0|This is a great movie and I received it within a few days of it being released at a great price that beat the stores price. This is now my new favorite way to purchase new movies.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I ordered this book... which I believe is Ms. Flynn's second... because I'd been so impressed with her first, Sharp Objects, and her much-talked-about Gone Girl.  Her ability to present so many different first person points of view... so credibly... male, female... old, young... while artfully interweaving &#34;then&#34; and &#34;now&#34; time-lines... it's quite impressive.  But I think mostly... I just liked the characters a little more in Dark Places.  It's a good story.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very useful app lets you know exactly what battery life you have left which is different for whatever you are doing ie playing music watching a video etc
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|This one is a grower. At first it's kind of messy, but the more you listen the more you enjoy the different sounds and concepts.<br />20/20 is not FS/LS, you can't love it instantly, but it's the kind of album you can enjoy and keep listening again and again.<br /><br />Try this: Listen to this album at least 5 times before judging, you will love it.
B00846REIS|3.0|I read this book because I had read the 50 Shades trilogy. It was a good read and I look forward to reading more of your works.
B009AMAGQM|2.0|The preview made this movie look like a cute love story - boy meets girl with a secret. While there were some great special effects (the spinning table stands out) and the plot was okay, the thinly veiled attacks on small towns and southern Christians left a bitter taste in my mouth.<br /><br />I have spent 95 percent of my life in various small towns in various southern states; I grew up in the Deep South, and I can tell you for a fact that Gatlin, the supposed South Carolina town in this movie, is completely foreign to me. \\"Beautiful Creatures\\" managed to pack so many stereotypes into the first five minutes, I wanted to gag. It didn't get any better as the film progressed.<br /><br />I have never met anyone who even vaguely resembles the \\"southern Christians\\" in the movie, who are portrayed as closed-minded, bigoted, nasty, and downright stupid. Every single one appears this way, with the exception of Amma, who is something of a \\"seer\\". The kindest people I know are from the Deep South; they are people who will stop in the pouring rain or 100 degree temperatures to help a stranger stuck at the side of the road push their car to the nearest gas station. I didn't appreciate seeing them mocked every other scene.<br /><br />The schools were just as laughable and unrealistic. We are told that To Kill a Mockingbird is banned, along with most classics, for undisclosed reasons. To demonstrate how embattled Lena is, we are treated to the endless stupidity of the school mean girls (all of them wearing cross necklaces, of course). Everything that came out of their mouths started with \\"my mama said\\", and it was always something ugly. At one particularly ridiculous point, they start calling on God in the middle of class to bring down judgement on Lena, leading to the shattered window incident.<br /><br />An even more cringe worthy scene features a \\"hearing\\" in which the town gathers in a church to discuss having Lena expelled from the school.<br /><br />To top it off, the maincharacters' accents were horrible. I've never understood why Hollywood is so inclined to butcher southern inflection. It seems that in most instances, they do not cast actors and actresses who are actually from the south, which is rather strange, considering there is no shortage of them in America. One glaring mistake was the speed at which the protagonists spoke. In Dixie, we speak slowly and clearly, whereas I could barely understand Ethan at some points.<br /><br />Overall, these stereotypes and insulting portrayals soured the movie for me.<br /><br />As a side note, I thought it was a little strange that Ethan was supposedly heading off to college (finally getting to leave that horrid little place that is South Carolina for the open-minded, progressive blue state of New York) six months later, considering he was supposed to be in eleventh grade at the beginning of the film. What happened to his senior year?
B004LWZW9C|4.0|This was fun to watch with the girls while enjoying a bottle of champagne!  I thought some of the cast was a little mis-matched, though.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|The movie brings together a gifted cast that allows the viewer to be part of an amazing life experience. The subject of sex is treated FRANKLY and yet without eroticism of any kind. A great movie!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|After reading this book I find it very interesting, fascinating and informative but I still ask myself why a man like Steve who has everything would make that one bad decision in life that caused his death. Yes it has to do with his arrogance but does he very think about his family, his friends and loved ones who will suffer because of his bad decision.
0345803485|5.0|I loved this book, have read all three books 4 times so far, I can't wait for the movie to come out
B000J3OTSM|5.0|Another in the series that's a must have for any interested dance watchers and breakers...I loved it as well as my wife and quite impressed in price paid for most of these volumes
B009KEN87O|4.0|a good shooter for folks who like old school style space romper like Defender or Galaga.  Pick ot up for some good brainless fun.
B0012QCZ54|5.0|Wife fell in Love with these series as soon as she heard and seen the first...had to have the whole set and well worth watching... Have never been let down by orders...A got to watch
B003BW0CB6|5.0|I have read all of the Harry Bosch series books and I love them all. I can really relate to Harry
B009KEN87O|5.0|When I got this app as the freebie of the day,  I thought it was going to be a space invaders knock off and it was going to sucks. That was not the case! The power-ups are decent and take the game literally in a different direction. Really fun and not complicated to play.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|I have read all of the Harry Bosch series books and I love the all. I can really relate to Harry
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Little House on the Prairie - English Style!!!<br />Love it! I highly recommend this and I am so thankful Amazon Prime has this available!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of the best shows ever, I think everyone should watch it. Even if you don't like zombies, you should give it a try.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|This is a great debut album.  This group has all the southern roots necessary to charm the young and the old.  It's good to know that their type of music is still around and getting alot of attention.  I'm an old man (62) whose son told him to listen to \\"Hold On.\\"  I did; then I bought this cd and heard \\"Hang Loose\\" and \\"Rise to the Sun.\\"  Truncated, Yoda like lyrics driven by a voice that cries for blues while coupled to deep south rhythm and blues, rock and roll, or some other life form--at once unique and familiar--that's what this group brought to me.  What a great purchase!
0446585025|5.0|This book was hilarious. Ellen writes like she speaks and it's almost as if you can hear her voice in your head while you read. I couldn't help but read some parts aloud to my husband after cracking up. Just a feel-good book that'll instantly put you in a good mood. Would be great as a gift as well.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Excellent especially for killing time at the airport or something like that.  There is a little stratagy to the game which actually makes me play it more rather than gettting bored so fast.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway serfers is #1when it comes to games like temple run and southern games like it.I give subway suffers a 5 and you'll know why when you get it.
B007MU85D0|5.0|One of my favorites right now....gets you up and moving. Wonderful sounds that put my head in a wonderful place !
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I very much enjoyed this book! The characters' personalities felt very real. The love story aspect was beautifully described, so as to make the reader really feel. Passionate scenes were heart-pounding, without being graphic. The dilemmas throughout the story were entirely believable, as well as the characters' reactions to them. Overall, a fantastic read. Highly recommended!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love FB and I love this ap for my Kindle Fire. It has easy access to all the places I usually go on FB and runs very smoothly. The only thing it can't do is allow me to play my favorite games.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This is a fun and easy game for kids. To buy more perks is a little expensive. Overall a good game
0765325950|5.0|Yes, most of the story lines were closed enough for satisfaction. Yes, a fourteen book monster has finaly been laid to rest. Yes, a few threads were left dangling to give us hope for sequels. But the biggest &#34;yes&#34; is that this was a well written and satisfying conlusion to Robert Jordan's greatest literary work. More action that any of the other books. The story flowed like it hasn't since book two or three. If there were not so many plot lines leading up to MoL, it could stand on its own as a great read.
B00AJLHUAS|3.0|This is a difficult one for me to review.  I am a big fan of Ferry and so I purchased without having heard any of it.  It's probably going to appeal more to Jazz Age music fans than Ferry fans, if that makes sense.  I have played it half a dozen times now and, with a couple of exceptions, I still have to refer to the sleeve to tell me which song is actually being played.  It's that different.  Actually, I can deal with that.<br /><br />What I am still struggling with is the way that the recording has been engineered.  They have gone for the Jazz Age sound as reproduced by a Jazz Age phonograph.  Great if you are going for that atmospheric sound from records of that era but I would have preferred something with more fidelity to the actual sound of the band.  Hard for me to explain but if you play this through a half decent audio set-up, it sounds pretty bad.  I would strongly recommend sampling a track to see wheher you like what they have done before commiting to buy.
B007FEZQF8|4.0|To be honest, I watched the show before I read this, but I liked the pace that the story moved at as a comic. Not as much time was wasted on pointless character drama as in the show. Seems like The Walking Dead was better designed as a comic.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|This movie really exceed my expectations.I would recommend this movie to anyone.It had me from start to finish. Loved it.
B001GM28HO|3.0|meh.. I like a few of the songs, but skip over most.  they start to sound the same over time.
B004R1Q2EG|4.0|\\"You know far less about yourself than you feel you do.\\" This is why you should read this book.<br /><br />I'm giving this book four stars because it delves into areas of thought that we take for granted in our busy, fast-paced lives. I was unfamiliar with some of the topics Kahneman explores which were complex in meaning and had to be read slowly to fully understand the concept. I can understand why some people didn't finish the book.<br /><br />The fundamental concept of the book is based on our emotional, comfortable, familiar thinking (fast thinking) and our cerebral, methodical, calculating thinking (slow thinking). The author introduces a number of concepts in this book including: the certainty effect, the outside view, disposition effect, sunk-cost fallacy, preference reversal, framing effect, focusing illusion, and my favorite, neuroeconomics, a term I've never heard before. The author explores the way these effects impact our decision making. This makes it an interesting book.<br /><br />I made 59 notes and highlights while reading this book. The book is filled with interesting explanations of how we make decisions and the factors that influence our decision making process. I could write a book on these notes but instead I'll provide a few highlights.<br /><br />Interesting Notes:<br /><br />People have a tendency to infer from the particular to general but not from the general to the particular. When presented with a story about an individual, we easily make assumptions about humanity as a whole. Characteristics, on the other hand, of society as a whole are not given to a particular individual.<br /><br />Humans weigh losses twice as much as gains, especially when the losses are the result of a decision they've made. The experiment cited in the book illustrates this type of loss but it also reflects a change in property rights (the property of health). In this hypothetical experiment, people are exposed to a decease (they lose the property of health) and are asked how much are they willing to spend for a vaccine. People will pay a lot to get their health back but they have a limit. In the alternative situation, subjects are asked how much they are willing to spend to expose themselves to the chance of decease (they have the property of health and are asked what they are willing to be compensated to give up their health). People will ask a lot more to give up their health than to try and get better. This is the same as asking how much you are willing to spend (to get better) vs how much are you willing to sell (possibility of giving up your health).  You will always pay less to buy than what you are willing to sell something for. This reflects the value of property rights, something I learned in cost/benefit economics.<br /><br />Another interesting discovery in this book is Neuroeconomics. This is the study of the human brain while making important decisions. For example, altruistic behavior that favors group well being at the expense of the individual, something that's irrational in the economist's world. In one experiment, psychologists measure the brain activity in the pleasure centres when punishment is given to subjects who have unfairly treated others.<br /><br />Troubling Notes:<br /><br />One criticism I have of the book deals with the topic of probability. The idea that the real world is like a controlled probability experiment where each trial in life is unrelated to a previous event appears to be simplistic to me. In some cases it isn't related and in some it is. The fact that this is omitted is troublesome for me.<br /><br />I also have a problem with some of the experiments that the author uses in the book. The experiments have little impact in the respondent's life and to infer these same behaviors exist during real life situations is suspect. One example is the way a Harvard student answers a casual question that has no consequence if they get it wrong vs their response if it contributed to their grade.<br /><br />There is much more I would like to add to this review but I will stop here. This is a fascinating topic that I plan to pursue in the near future. You can spend a life time exploring this subject as some have. I highly recommend this book..<br /><br />There is much more I would like to add to this review but I will stop here. This is a fascinating topic that I plan to pursue in the near future.

B009KEN87O|5.0|Very creative and well done.  I look forward too seeing more apps from this company. And I have seen no ads yet at all.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Thoroughly enjoy this game.  Wish you didn't need a connection to upgrade gear, but that is the only minor inconvenience.  Most real money purchased items can be gained through the first chest using the free keys gained every 20 mind....rare but still nice when it happens.  Your battery will take a hit during long play, but that's to be expected from a high demand game.
B009KEN87O|4.0|Good game play. Very much like Space Invaders. Not so good on graphics. 8 bit graphics in a 64 bit world. Good game though. Better graphics would rate a 5.
B009KEN87O|5.0|If you like Space Invaders or Galaga you will like this.  I really love being pleasantly surprised like this.  Good stuff.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Better than the weather channel App Good balance of information. Easy to navigate. Cheap price good graphics More information than other sites
B001200SQS|5.0|This is an album that I got my hands on this back in like, I wanna say 93. Anyway I noticed that it was available through amazon & picked it up again. Let me tell you it plays well with others. Other badass heavy metal bands of course, that is. I have it thrown into a playlist consisting of bands like Dethklok, Slipknot,  Machinehead, & Walking Corpse Syndrome. And let me tell you that the age difference is seamless & does not show at all. This album is one of the greatest ever put out buy the Cavalera brothers & even the actual band itself. (A note for those of you who weren't aware. While Sepultura still exist, many members, if not all from the original line-up have moved on.)
B009KEN87O|4.0|Although the graphics are the worst than any other app I've ever seen, the game is entertaining. I'm 43 and grew up with Atari and Space Invaders and the era of huge pixels. I like the game play but I still think the graphics could be a little better and still have the vintage look.<br />  Definitely download. This is a game everyone would enjoy. Maybe some people more than others.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|Great graphics for a animated film!  I was amazed with the life like characters in the movie and the story was great.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Glad to see this as a FAOTD but willing to pay for it. Not sure about the current price tho, call me a cheapskate lol. Very much enjoyed playing it with my teenagers while reminiscing about the video games of the good ol' 80's with them. Fun, very fun. Definitely going to play it again as soon as I can pry it from my kids' hands! Good job Noctua Software!
B005JABU82|4.0|i absolutely love freedom gundam. i literally have several different model types and grades so i know what im talking about. this one is effing awesome for being 1/144. its unbelievable. everything works fine and looks amazing except the wings... my big issue was the funnels kept slipping out. other then that... its awesome. one of my favorite 144s
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really better than temple run! You should give it a try. You should try this on Facebook to.<br /><br />Sparky
B0063IH60K|4.0|I can not stop playing this game ....it is becoming an obsession!!  :)<br />once you start u can not stop!!
B0049JPU8A|5.0|Awesome group..love this group..every song rocks. Buy it if you like the script. I listen to it every day constantly.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I enjoyed every line, page and chapter. I am eagerly looking forward to reading the next book in the series.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Grate fun and addicting it is one of the best games I ever played l love how you can have any animal you want
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Setting is beautiful, character development is amazing and the story line keeps you wanting more. Looking forward to season 3.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|Girlfriend loved it. She has almost completed the whole thing in 3 weeks. Happy with disks and their quality. Highly recommend for guys to get their significant others if you are in the doghouse.
B009NNG202|3.0|This premise of this film was interesting and kept me interested until it went left at the very end with a scene that appeared out of left field.  It was a &#34;huh&#34; moment.  The actor that played the murderer played his role quite nicely.  Nonetheless, I would not recommend.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|It's much better than the regular FB app that came with the Fire. The proportion between pix and typing is off. Sometimes the message icon is non reactive. Overall, good.
B002HSSAY6|3.0|The movie was fairly slow moving from start to finish.  The pace of the film made it difficult to watch.  I also found it to be rather disjointed.  I would not recommend.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great retro game.  I found it more fun then the arcade game I played as a kid. This is the best free app of the day I have gotten.
B001ILFUD2|5.0|My daughter wanted this movie! It came very quickly and the price was reasonable. I would recommend this movie to everyone.
B004SN7846|4.0|I've bought a number of Merrells over the years and have always been pleased with the fit, performance and durability.<br /><br />These Sonic Gloves were a good deal and are my first pair of barefoot shoes. They weigh next to nothing, but provide a good feeling of protection from whatever surface I'm on. I'm easing into them as suggested by Merrell and others and wearing them no more than 30 minutes a day to begin with.<br /><br />These were slightly longer than any other size 10.5 Merrells I've purchased. Usually I can pop right in a 10.5 and they fit perfect. These have a bit of extra length and more room for my toes than what I'm used to.<br /><br />Still, I really like these and am anxious to get fully in to the Barefoot experience. Grok on!
B005G5PPGS|5.0|Fantastic book.  It's always great to see pompous insiders who don't really know what they are doing get blown up by Upstream Thinkers.  Lots of lessons here even outside of baseball.
B00BN3DPQ4|3.0|What surprised in screening this was that a even well seasoned performer, with a limited but highly successful schtick, can get rusty over time.<br /><br />Arnold, already infamous for his market focused craft, was skilled enough to pull off the specific roles that fit his abilities. But one can really see the oxide that had built up over the 10 years between full-time gigs. It seemed that, while heading a state government, the past decade of clamping down his natural, and sometimes overbearingly positive, personality had a more profound and lingering effect.<br /><br />In this production, he plays a sheriff in a small Southern California town that is way off the beaten track. The former LA special services cop has found peace and serenity dealing with the mundanity of parking violations and the occasional drunk. Unbeknownst to him - his life and the lives of the residents are about to be upended by an escaped drug lord intent on driving through their land into Mexico and freedom from US law enforcement.<br /><br />Aided by a cadre of hardcore private contractors who have been hired to, quite literally, clear a path - can the sheriff stop the determined felon and his band of heavily armed mercenaries with just a handful of backwater officers? Utilizing one of Arnie's trademark menacing squinty-eyed quips, \\"I've got an idea.\\"<br /><br />The tiresome and trite opening of this flick is happily forgotten when the action elements pick up steam a little past a third of the way in. And despite the fanciful (read ludicrous) premise of the screenplay, was the only reason I stuck with it to the end.<br /><br />Overall, entertaining enough and worth the one-time screening. But anyone expecting an Arnie movie of old will be disappointed. In spite of the very enjoyable high speed chase sequences, there just wasn't enough invested in establishing the characters beyond their perfunctory sketchy outline. One has to put that onus on Korean director Jee-woon Kim. Like many non-western directors, they often struggle to successfully transplant, translate and transform their skills to and for the US palette. More so given that this was his very first production outside his country.<br /><br />Hopefully, Arnie works on a better vehicle with a more proven director.<br /><br />Movie Notes:<br /><br />- To the best of my knowledge, this is only the second time a large industrial magnet is used to hijack an armored transport in a film. One of my all-time favorite &uuml;ber classic comedies - the original 1979 version of [[ASIN:B002SFJ9XE The In-Laws]].<br /><br />- How about that cameo Conan sword and pose? Nice!  :-D<br /><br />- As 2013 marks his (non-cameo) featured return to the big show - and in keeping with their friendly feud - I would say that Sly Stallone's recent 'Bullet To The Head' is a tad better and a bit more enjoyable production. But that opinion might be jaded because I have a thing for Sarah Shahi. &lt;g><br /><br />Personal Note:<br /><br />- Interestingly, I'm actually a fan of Johnny Knoxville. Although generally dismissed as an actor, I find him to be a solid performer with hints that he has a much wider range than his film resume suggests. Most certainly better than any number of robotic six-pack pretty boys from a wide array of reality-tv programs wanting to move onto the silver screen.n directors, they often struggle to successfully transplant, translate and transform their skills to and for the US palette.

B009HUB40Y|4.0|I only have 3 issues with this game: 1. the link to the intake advert is broken, 2. playing the game multiple times a day about twice a week it goes to a black screen between the load screen and the main menu, 3. earning in game coins is PAINFULLY slow. Aside from that, I must say, a very well done game.
0375703764|5.0|At this point, I feel like simply listing adjectives might be the best way to describe the book: fascinating, challenging, frustrating, funny, scary, heart-wrenching, and at turns both pretentious and self-deprecating. This is not a quick nor easy read. The books contains a wraparound story, a literary criticism of a fictional found-footage film, footnotes, footnotes to footnotes, long digressions, transcripts, \\"missing\\" sections, numerous appendices, experimental page layouts, colored text, and more. (Beware the section regarding the labyrinth - it is easy to get lost there.) At times, one is waiting for the whole thing to make sense, to coalesce into something more than a gimmicky post-modern experimental work. And.... It does. It comes together beautifully. Again, this is an example of the format of the book helping us to sympathize/empathize with the characters. The more I reflect on the book, the more I enjoy it. In the end, it is a thought provoking story of love, loss, and healing. Good stuff. Well worth the effort to read/explore this house fully.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|What can I say? The book has no nutritional value... poorly developed characters, lazy use of language, little thought to detail, major plot gaps, and long, boring BDSM sex scenes. It was still a fun read, though. Every once in a while we need a bag of chips and a coke, right?
B0052GACNM|5.0|If you are from my generation, you know only a few artists really had it: Tony Bennett, Mel Torme, Nat King Cole. The phrasing, the warmth, the totality of artistry ... of these, Tony Bennett, alone, remains the quintessential vocal artist. It doesn't hurt that he is also an absolutely genuine, warm, caring human being. Hats of to Mr. Bennett.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|At the urging of friends, I viewed the first episode of the first season and much to my surprise, I was hooked.  I spent several cold Sunday afternoons, rainy Saturdays and late nights viewing all three seasons. The third season ending episode was very tragic, but knowing Lady Mary the Crawley family and the servants, I am sure they will recover and thrive with grace. I would recommend it to anyone.
0345495004|5.0|If you are not familiar with the life of Frank Lloyd Wright, stop reading reviews of this book, stop googling his life, and go get this book and read it. The writing is profound and the less you know about the real life subjects before you begin, the more shocking this true tale can be. I have recommended this book to so many people who are enthralled by the deep analysis of a woman tormented by a love she wishes and the fate that it provides. Mamah Borthwick is a character you will identify with, despise, and ultimately cry with.  More powerful than the love story is the underlying themes of societal guilt and judgement we all must face. Very good discussable book for a book club!
B00865P3AS|5.0|These guys are really outstanding. They do a great job interpreting the music they are playing. I like the mix of songs
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the series...  Can't wait for more.  A glimpse of the Royals lifestyle with all the grandeur and pomp of the period with a bit of history mixed in.  Especially love Maggie Smith's portrayal of the Dowager Countess.  The entire cast is superb...  Well done!!!
B004LWZW4M|4.0|Really good special effects...especially the facial expressions and interactions with the ape....however, the lead actor is just not good in anything I've seen him in: Spiderman, now OZ...this guy even looks dirty...check out his teeth in OZ, the new movie...toothpaste, this guys needs toothpaste if he's going to act...
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I cannot wait until season 4. this is an excellent continuing story. My family has watched this movie as well as my friends
B002ZG980U|1.0|Wow...this movie gave me a headache...I watched it twice, but each time I found myself struggling to keep up with the new directions behind the plot...in the end I thought, &#34;who cares&#34;....it's going to the rescue mission with Journey 2: the story of an obnoxious kid who should've been fed to the dinosaur...
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I have to say I do like this app.....when it works! it has taken many many chips away for buying your cards and then disconnects and kicks u out without returning your chips.... other apps aren't as buggy as this one but it is a good app when it works!
B004A8ZWW4|3.0|This movie is OK...I love special effects so that part was good, but the lead actor was in no way challenged by the part (see him in Les Miserables...he's extremely talented, even though I don't care for musicals...especially that one)...he was also Wolverine in the movie series about people with extreme capabilities...
B004PGAQMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie a lot its funny and its a very good movie I want to watch it again!!
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|A interesting, sad, funny touching and beautiful story with wonderful acting from all the actors. Knowing it was a true story made it even more profound.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|I found this book to be quite boring.  We read it for our book club.  It was touted as the &#34;Harry Potter for adults&#34;.  They are reading the sequel, but I might sit that month out.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Neat old style game. Addictive. Can see myself playing for a while killing time at work. Glad I got it today
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Excellent movie! You will absolutely LOVE this movie! The price was awesome as well. Get this one, you won't regret it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|It's a good game most of the time. Every once in a while there are issues. If the issues would stop it would be a great game.
B00BHU2A7I|2.0|The acting was decent but, for the most part, I found it boring. The only positive I could take from it was how hard it is to shoot a scene perfectly in its depiction of the shooting of the shower scene in Psycho.
B000I14UTS|2.0|Only one memorable song.<br /><br />A very difficult subject, good story telling, not enough music-- it is after all a musical. Joel Gray was terrific; the other performers were less than adequate.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This really is as good as the reviews state. Space Invaders was my favorite game ( back in the day - oops giving away my age) and this game is very similar if not just like it. I found the controls easy but took me a minute to figure out you can go anywhere on the screen. I really recommend this game and would pay money for it. Free app today is a bonus. I may not share this one with the kid. ha ha just joshing.<br />Enjoy!<br />FloridaMom
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I bought this movie for my husband for Christmas and he was so excited to watch it. We don't have a 3D TV, but the Blu-ray looks great! Very funny movie too. I had only seen the Iron Man movies and had no problem understanding the plot. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes action and humor.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is the best game ever it has cool powerups and graphics it is just amazing. i play it all day longed
B00AGOGOLE|2.0|Not user friendly and the picture is not clean. I wish to remove it from my computer until I find something better.
B005LAIGWS|2.0|Like the first one better number two. There lot stuff they sould put in it from the first one then just put in lot parts that doesn't need it.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Was great until the update. Since the update its hard to read with to much junk. If I can get the update off I will be happy with it again.
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|I loved this movie...the story, the acting, the masterful directing, the scenery...everything!<br />I didn't know it was based on real life, real people until I read the credits, Immediately I googled it and found out it was done true to the real story...an inspiring collection of real, honest, human beings, ordinary people who did extraordinary things!<br />If you have a family, invite them all to see it!
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|This movie was really good for my three girls.  They loved it.  Smart storyline and humorous for all ages.  Would recommend for anyone.
B000EHSN9Y|5.0|Bought one, worked for 2 weeks. the company replaced with no questions asked. The new one didn't work at all. Never called back for a replacement or for my money back. Just bought this one for a little bit more money from Apple which works perfectly fine.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Use to watch this with my children when they were younger years ago, and always loved it. Now that they are out of the house, I had to purchase this one for myself:)
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I am not a reader as my job involves so much of it. Wife recommended I read this and couldn't put it down!
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|Great condition. And great season. The shipping was fast. And the season set was authentic. The seller had lots of other titles. And the season again was a great season. Lots of actions dn drama.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|I think it's a really cute movie for kids and entertaining enough for adults too.<br />The movie came in good condition, no complaints there.<br />My kids watch it at least once a week.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|A very good movie, the dvd was great.  I could not access the Digital UV content on my Kindal Fire though.  I would of liked to view the film on it.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|These movies are all box office smashes! A must for anyone's movie library and favorites for years to come. Pure enjoyment!
B006BG7RI0|5.0|I purchased this gift for my husband and brother-in-law this past Christmas. They both loved them. It is a great collector's edition! Super happy with the purchase!
B0018PH3L0|5.0|After seeing this miniseries at it's inception, I have always wanted to own it.  Now I do and I never get tired of watching it.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I now join a growing band of people willing George to hurry up and finish the next book. Woe is me, what do I read while I wait?
B001HN694K|5.0|Great movie! Well priced and received in good time and was packaged well to protect the product. I would highly recommend this DVD to everyone!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I couldn't wait to start this book and it was every bit as good as I thought it would be.<br />I have bought all 5 books and am so glad that they are long, so I know I have months of quality reading ahead!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is a fabulous version of this movie. What a dashing captain Ciaran Hinds makes. The setting of the movie is also breath taking.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I found the 1st quarter of this book a bit of a slog but stick with it. The further you go the more engrossed you become.<br />great plot, great characters and good twists.
B006964E8S|4.0|After following Jack Reacher for years and becoming disappointed in the predictable, I now have a new hero. Baldacci wins in all areas and his hero is now mine.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|They just get better and better. The only down side to finishing this book is I know I am now one book close to the end!
B00A31UXLW|5.0|If you love Harry you'll love this Connelly.  Harry is maturing gracefully, doing things as only Harry does. Gusto and guts.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I recommend 8-12year olds will love I loved it and I'm thirteen train and care for your pet awesome awesome. awestruck &lt;3
B000002KGT|5.0|This was actually the eleventh or so fleetwood mac album, but only the second to include that lovable schizo lindsay buckingham, and his witchy woman....miss stevie nicks. Hipsters of the day used to talk crap and say how the bad plummeted in quality from this change....as this new incarnation of the band moved the band from a less blues/rockabilly direction and more into a focused pop vein. They also went from selling 100,000 or so records to over 20 million...so you can't blame them. during the making and touring of this record, the band had an infamous rock star life which including sleeping with each-other and ingesting everything short of embalming fluid...which would make anyone feel magical and over the moon! It's a wonder everyone is still alive, to be honest! While each member has certain moments of splendor on their own with their respective solo projects...they have such chemistry together and really seemed to anchor each other in. for example...lindsay has such a gift for melody but his solo work can be inaccessible to some....Stevie someones needs help with her lyrics and artistic vision but is so so on the money here and there is no way she could reach this level again...and her solo work never did. While this record may not be everyone's taste...its simply impossible to dislike it for what it is...wonderfully written pop music that was indisputably magical and of its time. however...the follow up record..\\"tusk\\" is a bit more risque and daring...and i would argue even more chances were taken with records like \\"tango in the night\\"....
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I think think this app I very useful I like it a lot its great and am I turtly enough for the turtle club
B006ZGDC26|4.0|With a few classic songs ommitted, this is a nice overview of the output of the legendary label. Good investment.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|Love this film and the book. Even though they split one small book in to 3 films, I will see them all.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks great and some good extras
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Couldn't put this down. Wanted to know what had happened in the past to these people and what their future looks like. Hoping for more!
B000JMKOI2|5.0|If you like Bukowski, this one should not be missed. If it is your introduction to his work, it will be an eye opener, a real chuckle, and a discription of life, that you know had to have been lived, to be presented so well.
0385344228|4.0|There are so many facets to this book, it's hard to sum up in one review.<br /><br />The book touches on the following:<br /><br />- is there such thing as a murder gene?<br />- is there ever a point when a parent questions their child?<br />- even if someone isn't proven guilty are they ever innocent?<br /><br />So a great part of this book is that it is a very thought provoking and conversational item. Hands down.<br /><br />The story itself, also very good, but i'm a true crime fan. And the format at which it was written is also very interesting: narrator tells the story, but it is also sprinkled with parts of the transcript from the court room.<br /><br />And the best part, the ending has about 3 or 4 quick twists which are real shockers.<br /><br />So why wouldn't this book get 5 stars?<br /><br />Because there was one jab (a twist) that shocks the reader and then the story gets slow and you want it to be over because you realize that there's not so much of the book left, so not much can happen. And it starts to drag...and then boom! there are two more twists in succession...which were great twists but they are sort of tacked on in the end just for the shock factor and sort of to explain other parts of the book. And then the book ends.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of abrupt endings, I like them more fleshed out...so that's the one star off. Other than the, it was a suspenseful, thought provoking novel that will definitely stand out among other books.<br /><br />Worth the read. The ending is great and the writer obviously has skill...<br /><br />I feel like this is one of those books that I'll continue to think about and might just come back and add that last star on...
B001F7MSG6|5.0|a must have if you have ether one of the movies, . Good special effects and good costumes<br />good stories
B000HT3PPG|5.0|There are so many versions of this movie, but this one is without a doubt my favorite. Wouldn't own another version.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This CD I have ordered for myself and friends many times. I keep one in each vehicle we own and one on the boat,
B0086700CM|5.0|this the greatest game ever if u don't like this game u r crazy. if u don't like this comment. u r a hater
B009U9S6FI|4.0|Very good book.  I will need to reread this again to see if things click from me personally.  It was a quick read and was very interesting.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|A great sounding CD.  Initially attracted by the song &#34;Home&#34;, it turns out there are several other really good tracks on here.  A CD the whole family can enjoy.
B00ARI9CDQ|1.0|I liked the app,but I recently had to uninstall because it keeps crashing on my Kindle. Bummer because the news content was good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Lots of fun and easy for all age groups. I wish I could customize my own horse. But I still am having fun with the game.
0451196716|5.0|I have read this book several times in my life and ordered it for my 13 year old. I think it is by far the best book ever written by King. Not too graphic, but really makes you think. My daughter and had deep, philosophical discussions about how the different walkers represent different people in society. She loved it.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Everything is amazing!!!!nothing bad to say graphics are amazing and the game it's self is amazing so again it's a very good game Doesn't have flaws and it feels like an old school game
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Another great Playrix game. Good graphics, smooth, challenging play. I would highly recommend. I have been playing pretty consistently since I downloaded it because it's addictive.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|It was a gift for my husband he was absolutely astonished with the Becker. Not a day goes by that he doesn't pick it up saying how much he loves it.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I have only had the opportunity to use the app once since I purchased it, but it worked beautifully for me.
B00280LYIM|5.0|This book was AMAZE!!!<br />Fun and ez read<br />I read it in three days I love this author cool book
0451196716|2.0|The plot for the story is like a vacant unmarked grave.  I found that my opinion of Mr. King's book is different than the appraisals of hundreds of other (fans) readers as most are 5 stars.  There are only two books written by Stephen King that I consider sub-basement.  The first is Gerald's Game, a disgusting piece of used toilet paper.  The second is The Long Walk.  He surely had to dig really deep in the septic system of muck and unused despoiled imagination to create this piece of work.<br /> His writings are similar to a PHD level English text book, always with impeccable grammar. His imagination is second to NONE.  My two favorite books of all time are IT and The Talisman.  His others emerge as second favorites all time. The Stand, Thinner, Christine, etc., etc., etc.<br />But The Long Walk.  The only reason I finished it was because it was a Christmas present.  I didn't find myself rooting for any of the boys to win the walk because that would result in the deaths of the other boys. I didn't even hope the Major would catch a stray bullet to the head. Sick is the most flattering thing I can say about this book. Sorry SK.
B00A85EMVK|2.0|Saw this in the movie theatre IMAX 3D and got the poster stating that I could order new version. Was thrilled one of my favorite movies from the 80s. Loaded iTunes and downloaded movie. Got error stating not a high definition display. Do not know technical details but how is an Apple 30&#34; Cinema Display running at 2560 x 1600 not high definition? First movie I ever got that gave me this error. So to be clear this is not about the movie but about the Digital Copy that comes with it.
B006HL9G10|2.0|The chiming of the bowl(s) was more monotonous and boring and annoying rather than relaxing.<br />I found my self wondering when it was going to end and a new chime begin. So rather than being focused on relaxing and meditating I was distracted by the timing of the chime.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I love the 8-bit graphics in this game. I was expecting a dud but it's really a ton of fun. I really love &quot;invincibility&quot; mode because of the camera shift. It's sort of like Asteroids, but with a few graphical enhancements. This is currently one of my favorite games on the FireHD.
B00AK0X5VQ|3.0|This app can be fun but it is a little quirky and sometimes you are not really sure if you are controlling the sphere or it's controlling you!
B008VO3PA4|5.0|Their are a variety of poem subjects.  Many are amusing. The book can be read all at once or spaced out through days.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I am 62 yrs old and my husband is 65.  We both absolutely love this album.  My 26 yr. old listened to it in the car and I ordered it for him too!!  This album covers all ages and genres of music.  Justin has definitely grown up and so has his music.  He is an all around entertainer and will be around for a long time.  I am anxiously awaiting the followup to this album.
B0000026NC|3.0|The only reason to get this disc, and I recommend getting it used, is for songs you consider &#34;must-have&#34;, that are not on &#34;pulse&#34;. It's not that the performance is bad, but the production/mastering are BAD. Pulse is sonically far superior.
B002OOG6YY|3.0|Overall I liked the show. It's an enjoyable blu ray. However, the audio sometimes doesn't match the video which throws your mind for a curveball and distracts the video. I highly recommend this for diehard Manson fans
B000002B35|5.0|This disc is much preferred to &#34;delicate sound of thunder&#34;, due to a far superior production/mastering job: as clear as a studio disc. However, there are a couple of classic songs on &#34;Delicate Sound&#34; that make it worth buying used, that are not on Pulse.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I enjoy the way these books are written and the flow of the plot--but this is entirely subjective. Beyond that, the kindle version is good; I didn't have any problems and it was easy to read.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Since I'm a fan of heroic fantasy, I don't know why I hadn't heard about A Song of Ice and Fire before the HBO mini series was announced. Once I'd heard about it, I picked up the first book and loved it, and eagerly awaited the debut of the mini series. Now I've formed a habit of reading one book just before the start of a new season on HBO. So this month I read &#34;A Storm of Swords.&#34; Wow, this is without a doubt the best book in the series yet, filled with startling plot twists that led me to shout out as I was reading. I can't wait to read book four!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I tend to stick with succinct reviews. The writing, characters, and plot are compelling and compel the reader to continue reading without feeling the need to skip parts. As well, the kindle version is well done. A good buy.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|Reading the description of this book really got me excited to give \\"The Night Circus\\" a try. I actually just joined a book club and this was the book that they were going to discuss next; well...I never made it to the book club meeting, because I couldn't finish the book! I think I would get thru a few pages and fall asleep, or I'd read a few pages and be so confused that I just had to put it down. When I picked it back up again I was even more confused. I felt like the timeline of this story was so odd, I had a hard time following it. I kept hoping it would pick up but it never really did. Despite not making it to my book club, I decided to finish the book...only to face a terrible ending. Disappointing; I really wanted to like this. I may go see the movie when it comes out
1603425381|5.0|This is A great book for finishing any project OR to add some<br />\\"jazz\\" to anything. If A purchased item needs a little something,<br />this book will give you lots of inspiration to make it \\"all your own\\"!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Like my headder says, Much more expensive than competitors but connects tight and heavy duty. I tried to use other less expensive one only to come back to the quality of this one. And I have bought a few. Good QUALITY cable! It just works the best.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Great game! Just started playing, love that I don't have a specific time that I have to get back on.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|My whole family loves this game. My wife got this first and I heard everyone talking about it, but then one day I tried it and could not stop. This is great for both adults and little children 6 and up. My kids all like to be challanged by it and I do too. I like it for them because it teaches them to think!
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|This made a great Christmas present for my child and he loves it. He plays this game everyday and couldn't be happier.
B00B935SUY|5.0|Love Mr. Grohl. He's got such an infectious love of music. This was just a fun watch for anyone who loves music.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Not enough description on how to use. Just shy of making it simple for kindle also feel same about Ipad
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is a book I could read over and over, again. It is a romance book with a twist. Love it

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone!  I went through this season in 2 days.  Thank you for making this possible.  I can't wait for Season 4.
B002UOMGVU|5.0|Great movie and the blu ray added to my viewing experience. The book was interesting and the extras are good.
B0018AM1YY|5.0|This is just some of Neil's greatest hits, he keeps putting them out. This cd has been in my car player since the day I bought it.
B005JZBPHS|5.0|Came pretty fast in the mail through amazon. the movies are set up like a big book easier to keep up with the DVDs and very neat.  If you are looking for this it is a must buy through amazon. 😊
B009KEN87O|4.0|This game is great fun, I will really enjoy playing it.  However, it could use a brief tutorial or some further information on how to play for those of us who haven't played in some time.  I discovered by accident that I could move up the screen, the last time I played a game like this the ship was locked at the bottom and would only move side to side.  Also, there is nothing to indicate what the little objects coming down will do for you.  (Granted, the ones that look like small ships are obviously extra lives but I found out I was dodging things that would help by running into them).
B009KEN87O|5.0|This reminds me of the time I spent at my dentist's waiting area, playing &quot;Galata!&quot;<br /><br />I love it. Great response to movement, and the graphics fit.
