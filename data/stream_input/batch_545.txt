0743243315|4.0|I think what distinguishes Ali's novel from similar ones is the realism. The main characters seem real - they are neither excessively perfect (yet Nazneen remains remarkably captivating) nor excessively evil. This applies, very interestingly, to Chanu and Kasim, the sympathy for the first which grew while the latter declined as novel reaches closure. It applies to the choices made by Nazneen, her sister and her mother. And it applies to the background of the Muslim community in which the story takes place. Until the very end, we are surprised by the decisions and fate of the main characters, some of which are \\"un-heroic\\" or \\"un-romantic\\" but all of which are very \\"human\\". I think that it is this realism and sensitive handling of ambiguity that made the novel worthy of Booker Prize consideration.
0743454537|3.0|My first foray into Picoult's prose and style, and i liked what i read; although the structure was pivotal around a shared narrative, (which resulted in jarring and slowing down movement of the novel), it was an effective tool in terms of controlling tension and producing strong characterization. <br />Loved the subject matter - thoughtful, intense, real, and lent great insight into the world of bioethics and human rights - but i honestly felt cheated by the ending, much as others have noted in these reviews. Was Picoult lacking confidence here, and simply rushed an ending? not sure, but for all the strength she produced throughout earlier pages, the ending was weak and seemed anticlimactic in comparison, detracting from her earlier, more brilliant work.  While i understand Picoult's motivations for choosing such an ending, i think she cheated the reader and diverted from the true meaning of the novel.  <br /> <br />good work, but not great.
0553208845|5.0|In my opinion, all good books should facilitate opening up of the mind into a new world and challenge the reader to see more clearly, if not differently. This book did that for me. I do not know whether Hesse practiced any religion, but as a reader of Protestant Christian upbringing, I found many traces of Christian teaching in its ideal form. Moreover, I found many worthy precepts which seem to be lacking in Christian world. One such theme, and perhaps a central theme to this book, is that all things in this world are intertwined. Both what is apparently good or outwardly evil are in the end spectrums of the same Life. One might say that everything is godly. In Siddartha's endless search for the Universal Truth, I found elements of myself and of many others I see around. I also came to see how short we often fall of this ideal. But, the book reminded me of what it means to seek value and Truth, and inspired me to be more reflective. From a different perspective, I'm sure that Hesse had in mind such a search within his own soul as he wrote this gem of a book.

She just wants to make money, other wise she would've NOT released the platinum edition. Still, that's made me hate this too. <br /> <br />don't buy it---BUY MADONNA'S ALBUM INSTEAD! <br /> <br />even Carrie  Underwood is better than this trite!
B00005JNX0|4.0|I enjoyed this movie just as much as my 10 year old son did.  We laughed so much through it.  The penguins dancing and singing was just a good time for the both of us.  I thought it was just going to be another run-of-the-mill kids movie and now I have to sit though it. But it was a good, funny movie that adults and children alike will have fun watching.  I remcommend that the dvd be bought and have a nice family night movie.

B000002JOH|4.0|So what if they used to play Hair Metal? So what if they changed their image and their music. This is a flat-out Kick A$$ metal album. It doesn't even matter if they are putting on airs, because they have some talent in writing music (unlike Limp Bizkit), and the music is what matters, not the image of the musicians. These are killer metal songs. This is a must-have for Pantera fans. You snotty little know-it-all Linkin-Park-and-Limp Bisquick-listening generation Y brainwashed bratty b@stards don't know from metal!

B000BO0LLS|5.0|The ULTRA PLATINUM EDITION is by far the best version of this release. I like the original that was released back in April. But with the 4 new songs, now the album is complete. Long-term, I think people might regret not getting the CD/DVD. No telling how many copies of this version they're going to make. The videos are excellent and are a nice memento to have from this era. \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" is an incredible song, as is \\"Makin' It Last All Night,\\" \\"So Lonely,\\" and \\"We Belong Together-Remix.\\" If you're buying this for the first time, the CD/DVD is worth the extra money. Or if you already have the original, this is still a good buy. I LOVE the Ultra Platinum Edition!!!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|\\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is a GREAT album. This is one of Madonna's best. If you're a Madonna fan, then you absolutely have to add this CD to your collection immediately. The first single from the album \\"Hung Up\\" is stunning, a Madonna classic. But even better is the track that follows \\"Get Together.\\" The later reminds me of some of her earlier work like \\"Holiday.\\" \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is an impressive piece of work. Madonna does not disappoint.     FAVORITES:  Hung Up  Get Together  Sorry  Let It Will Be  Forbidden Love  Jump  Isaac

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna, 47, yet another re-Invention, dance music & video...Images of an aged Cher, or an uncomfortable Mariah Carey, on stage with a PVC mini-skirt on springs to mind. Fortunatly, for everyone Madge achieves it yet again! <br /> <br />So its disco balls gallore, but whats on offer here is not simple 'pop-cheese' with a beat behind it (Geri Halliwell should take a few notes). Rather, it's still has Madonna's individual sound, enhanced by a DJ's (Stuart Price's) excellent production. If you like Pop/Dance then this is definitly the album of the year. Just a dance person? Try the single re-mixes that will undoubtedly come from this album. <br /> <br />There are 8 outstanding tracks on this album, the best of them being Get Together, Sorry, Let It Will Be, & How High. Suprisingly 'Hung Up' is probably the 'poppiest' song on the record. You might have an urge to buy a CD player that has a 'speed' button. I can't help think some tracks would be better slightly faster. <br /> <br />Apart from that however, well done Madge! An absolutly excellent album!  <br />
006441034X|5.0|A great book. Amusing, at times quite funny, quite a bit of  fun.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|This is one of those movies that seems to come out with little fanfare or success and, after a while, the volume of the buzz rises until it becomes a \\"cult\\" film.<br /><br />First of all, this really is an original film.  That's a plus in my book.  Nowadays originality is very scarce in Hollywood.<br /><br />Secondly, this movie is seriously (and consciously) weird.  That's not necessarily good or bad, but it definitely helps with the cult status.<br /><br />Without retelling the story, I'd just say that it was generally satisfying.  It's hard to catagorize, but, as the name implies, it's a sort of modern film noir - with a little science fiction & horror mixed in.  It was very unpredictable, but things came together at the end - sort of.<br /><br />There are a few flaws.  I was mystified that Drew Barrymore was so badly miscast for the part of an intellectual teacher until I saw that she was an \\"executive producer.\\"  Money talks.<br /><br />Another problem, common among ambitious, unusual films, is that the part of the movie that takes place in the \\"normal\\" world wasn't very believable.  The dialog, especially between family members, didn't seem realistic.  Nobody seems to mind or hardly notice that Donnie is tremendously strange - he has lots of pals and gets a girlfriend without hardly trying.  Donnie and his buddies go to what appears to be a privileged private school, but, then, it doesn't.  The school bullies seem waaay over-the-top, especially considering the well-to-do suburban environment.  I could go on...<br /><br />But, despite the flaws, this movie keeps you interested.  While the viewer is at first presented with the old question of how much of what happens in the film is real or just in the protagonist's mind, it goes well beyond that before it's done.  The ending, where the loose ends are tied up (or are they?) - accompanied by the perfect song - is particularly well done.
B0008ISM40|3.0|This is an album I find sounds somewhat like all their previous albums rolled into one. In a way that should make it the best disc, but in another way it just recalls something we've heard before. There are no mind-blowing songs to my ears, no metal ala \\"Broken\\", and \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" and \\"Only\\" are indeed the catchiest of what's here. However, I still like it, and \\"With Teeth\\" is the right direction after the bloated \\"The Fragile\\". The DVD is simply \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" video, a discography with some samples, and stereo and surround mixes of the album. Nothing I really need to see more than once. Overall, if this was NIN's only disc I'd call it excellent. But when compared to their other albums it's simply good.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|At 47, Madonna proves that she still has the groove. Confessions on the Dance Floor is non stop techno music, reminiscent of the old dopey disco days. The music is surprisingly refreshing and it is a welcome guilty pleasure for the saturation of Rap and Pop music available today. The Killer opening track \\"Hung Up\\" is giddy and mesmerizing and so is \\"Sorry\\" and \\"Jump\\". There is nothing else special here, but the record was done all in fun which made the music oh so good.
B00006JL1Z|4.0|I recently got \\"The Very Best Of\\", and it confirmed my feeling that the \\"Greatest Hits\\" album was just not enough. This 2-disc collection includes every track the \\"Hits\\" disc had, and almost every track it didn't have, plus numerous pictures and a nice history lesson. Besides the obvious choices, I'm really happy this has \\"Silver Springs\\", \\"Landslide\\", \\"Second Hand News\\", and \\"Seven Wonders\\". \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" and \\"Family Man\\" are also nice inclusions. Overall it's a wonderful collection for any level of fan, and shows how many great songs they really did release. It'll go great with Stevie's \\"Best Of\\".

B000089CJI|5.0|The Postal Service is not something that conjures up positive emotions of relentless enjoyment.  Usually all I receive from the service are angry letters demanding my hard earned money from McDonald's.  However, when it comes to music, the Postal Service offers much, much more with their debut album, Give Up. <br /> <br />Thanks to the collaborative efforts of Ben Gibbard (Death Cab For Cutie) and Jimmy Tamborello (Dntel) we are graced with the presence of a blissfully delightful combination of indie rock and techno.  No matter what genres are being crossed, this mating of sorts results in a very catchy assortment of sometimes melodramatic themes ranging anywhere from the delusional hopes of returning to an ex (as in Clark Gable), to the assassination of JFK (as in Sleeping In).  The melodies invade your brain in ways that make it incredibly hard to resist the temptation to obsessively play the album.   <br /> <br />Although I have listened to this album more that I can count, I have never gotten tired of it, and I can always listen through the entire album without hesitation.  Each song is as spectacular as the song before it.  With this being said, there are very few albums that this can be said about.  I believe that the Postal Service provided an album that everyone can enjoy.  The songs are so catchy, that it is almost impossible to resist liking them.   <br /> <br />There are a few times in which the lyrics are corny, but the overall impact has not been diminished.  Such Great Heights is one of those said songs.  \\"I am thinking it's a sign that the freckles in our eyes are mirror images and when we kiss they perfectly align.\\"  Oh, get real.  No one really thinks that way.  But, the background music is so good that you don't even notice how cheesy some of the lyrics actually are.   <br /> <br />Overall, the combined efforts of Gibbard and Tamborello display an artistic quality that is not found often.  Even though most of the songs are about the different facets of the one emotion we just cannot grasp, this album isn't redundant.  Each song says something different, and puts a different aspect of what this emotion should be in your head. <br /> <br />Outstanding tracks:  Clark Gable, Brand New Colony, The District Sleeps Alone Tonight, and Sleeping In. <br /> <br />If you like the Postal Service, you should try Death Cab For Cutie, Say Hi To Your Mom, Yo La Tengo, or the Flaming Lips.   <br />

B000A88F22|5.0|I'm actually from Britney's hometown, and I DO know her. We don't go out and do lunch everytime she's home, but we do chat when we see eachother around town, and I know for a fact that she is and always has been an extremely down-to-earth person. I love this DVD, because it shows the Britney that I know. The tabloids have made her look horrible, but she's really not like that at all. The DVD is amazing, and you really get to know the Britney behind the tabloid.  <br /> <br />If you want to know what Britney Spears is really like and not just what people decide to write about the poor woman, this DVD is perfect. Not only is it entertaining and hilarious, but it's quite interesting to see that Britney is just a country girl struttin' her stuff on stage. You ROCK, Brit!
0307276902|1.0|James Frey is an opportunist who was able to con Oprah and many million others to read this garbage that he calls a book. First of all, he can't even construct a sentence. And his lies are so far off, I din't evn bother to finish the book. Neglected Souls is a fiction book that depicts the struggle of a drug addict far better that James Frey.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|After the a-dismal \\"American Life,\\" I assumed that Madonna had given up pop music for bell-ringing for Labor and other political concerns, like the Gen. Clark US presidential candidacy in 2004. I have always known Madonna to have strong political viewpoints, but regretted her insistence on making them part of her tour and recent lyrical content. Protesting George Bush has been de riguer among celebs for years, but distracts from the enjoyment that an entertainment product is supposed to bring, and dates the material. To join the chorus of Bush haters only made Madonna a me-too protester, and ended up costing her album sales, if the faliure of \\"American Life\\" is of any evidence.<br /><br />My hopes of \\"Confessions\\" were piqued when learning of her renewed focus on dance music, and my faith was fully re-established after giving the CD a few spins. This album is what I have been anticipating ever since \\"Music,\\" and exceeds anything I was expecting. It is simply hypnotic and begs exploration, especially in the disco.  If this were the '90s (and Madonna still owned the charts), this album could easily spawn 6 strong singles. I love 10 of them, with \\"Push\\" as my favorite.<br /><br />Maybe the political messages are buried within, but they don't weigh it down. My hat's off to Madonna for bringing the fun and fantasy back on the dance floor, and keeping the protests to herself... she makes a much better entertainer than she does a political commentator.<br /><br />\\"Confessions...\\" rates a solid 5 stars, with extra credit for the wonderful seamless quality in the CD mix. I hear that if you downloaded from iTunes, you may be missing out on the best aspect of this album. My advice: Buy The Disc!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|At first I thought some of the lyrics were a bit cheezy, but now I'm embracing every part of this album.  What I thought was cheezy seems to be part of the \\"confessions.\\"  It's completely fantastic.

B000B5XOXY|1.0|Enough has been said about how bad schumachers batman films were, but i cant resist. i HATED Batman Forever! its stank to high heaven! tommy lee jones two-face was a MESS! so was jim carrey's riddler. my God, he was ace ventura throughout the whole movie, NOT the dangerous, deadly riddler that ive known from the comics or the 1992 batman show. and chris o donnel as robin........no. i havent bought this dvd, and dont plan to. i liked this film when i was 7, but NOT when i got older, then i realized \\"DANG, this really is just kiddie crap!\\". what a departure from thr burton movies! is this REALLY part of the same franchise?? i dont think so...... if it was, we would have gotten 3 burton movies instead of this kiddie, neon filled disasters from schumacher. i mean, wheres that timless-looking gothic, dark Gotham city?? wheres those 40's looking fedoras and tranchcoats?? instead,m we get thugs with glowing faces and glow-stick staffs.  <br /> <br />one thing i will NOT forgive is how utterly BAD val kilmer is in the role as batman! hell, his bruce wayne even sucked! ppl like to say he \\"looked\\" the part, but performance is everything in the long run, and he was as boring and bland as can be. wheres that quasi-phsycotic bruce wayne/Batman who is out for blood and wants revenge as batman every night? wheres that SERIOUS bruce wayne? sadly, it aint here, and i stand by this: Michael Keaton IS BATMAN. end of story. and without Tim Burtons fanstactic, artistic, gothic-dark style, this franchise was bound to go down hill. lets face it, Tim Burton created some of the best Batman film (not to mention films in general) that we are un-likely to get anymore. in those films, there were characters i actually FELT for, and cared about. schumachers messes were kiddie crap, and christopher nolans \\"realistic\\" aproach was interesting, but bales batman was just not good IMO (looked really funny in that horrible looking cowl). Keaton is still the best in my eyes, he wasnt just playing Batman,he WAS Batman. he embodied batmans crazy side, as well as his normal, staightfoward bruce wanyne. val kilmer was a joke in this movie. i concur with the below reviewer, THIS film is where the Batman films took a BIG nosedive.

There are lots of variants and nobody can foresee each of them. That is analogy. This book give you lots of useful information on strategy and tactics how to play the game of negotiation. You have to use this information, as much possible information of the subject and your imagination . After all of that good luck. Sometimes you loose, sometime you win. That is life. Celebrate wins, but if you loose just sit in your car, go home and don't forget to sing and laugh.
B000BGH22W|2.0|While Doyle is a fine composer in his own right, there simply is no comparison to John Williams.  Subsequently, the discerning Potter fan will no doubt agree that this soundtrack is subpar.  Music often helps make the film as Williams' scores did for Potter-  this score does not.  It's just there.  Here's hoping that from these ashes, Williams rises next time with the Phoenix.
1400079179|5.0|I heard the audio book, then I read about 5 of the supporting research books, then I read The Davinci Code and then I saw the movie several times. I thought the book was better than the audio and the movie was a great enhancement of the book, being action sound and acting, with real trips to many of the books locations.<br /><br />As I listen to movie goers before and after the movie, in the theatre halls and lobbies, I hear two things; a) reassurance and approval from those who've read the book, and b) shock and bewilderment at the themes being put forward in the movie, by those who have not yet read the book or any of the supporting books. No wonder. Can you imagine the barrage of new and powerful statements being made and having 2 hours to come to terms with them. I think it will take some people just a little longer. The movie and the book are a great introduction to the issues, but the convincing evidence and remaining discussions linger close-by and not exclusively within The Davinci Code. Not by a long shot.<br /><br />However, while the research still goes on, the fundamentals are in place; that Christian history, Christian leadership and Christian documents, and CERTAINLY, the life of a human called Jesus (another well educated, very tactful and focused politician), the life of Mary Magdalene and the reality of John The Baptist have been extremely distorted over and over again.<br /><br />Where original documentation is found to assist in understanding, then all the better. Where it is lacking, then we have the ability to fill in the gaps or reveal the other gaps, with some reasonable, rational, intuitive, wise ideas until we find more data.<br /><br />So the question remains......while the Davinci Code is the tip of the iceburg, for providing a great introduction to the wide variety of research going on into the REALITY of what went on over the last 3500 years, from the stone builders in northwest Europe, to the Egyptians, to the cultural evolution of the middle east, to the days of Mary Magdalene/Jesus and their Benjamin/David implications...........are the ideas in the Davinci Code so supported by evidence and careful, substantiated thoughts at this point that we should now believe these things?<br /><br />Personally, I don't think it takes all that much research to realize that any religion that says that IT defines GOD and that IT provides the only interpretation of GOD and You must pass through IT to meet the GOD.......is of course nothing but criminal activity. Then considering the details of the history of the Roman Catholic Church, then it's no wonder why so much ignorance, stupidity, anger, abuse, perversion, hatred, degenerate behaviour and patronization was distilled into their leadership from the day of the Neanderthal called Peter.<br /><br />I think that millions will find shock, revulsion and possibly final release. I think that millions will rediscover self-respect, compassion, redemption and autonomy.<br /><br />I see that the book is highly popular with females.<br /><br />Thankyou!ion of the middle east, to the days of Mary Magdalene/Jesus and their Benjamin/David implications...........are the ideas in the Davinci Code so supported by evidence and careful, substantiated thoughts at this point that we should now believe these things? <br /> <br />Personally, I don't think it takes all that much research to realize that any religion that says that IT defines GOD and that IT provides the only interpretation of GOD and You must pass through IT to meet the GOD.......is of course nothing but criminal activity.

1932907009|5.0|My introduction to the book and concept was when I had the pleasure of participating in the workshop 'Basic Story Structure' taught by Blake Synder at the International Film and Television Workshops in Maine (which I warmly recommend). Skeptical at first - can it really be this simple - then convinced and now a converted; this simple yet powerful structuring of screenplays provides you with the needed foundation when writing and keeps you on track and in-line when you do so. The book is a great and fun read. Realistic and simple - it lays down the ground rules for structuring your script into 15 simple beats. Grab the book, read it and sit down and watch your favorite movies and see for yourself; the man was right all along. That simple. It is full of wonderful and delightful insights to what makes a good screenplay (apart from all important structuring). I have read a couple of 'write-your-own-screenplay' books now, this one beats them all. Simple, direct approach to screen writing. In addition to being a successful screenwriter, Blake is also an enthusiastic and charismatic teacher; so if you ever get the chance to participate in one of his classes, I suggest you do so.
B00001OH7U|5.0|I think he's had some better individual songs but this thing is his only truely killer album.   Who cares if there's only six songs? One of them is over ten minutes long for chrisakes. And it really is his greatest song you know...
B00012QM8G|1.0|I cannot for the life of me think of what the point was behind the scene where a supposed gas chamber actually turns out to be a shower room.  Is Spielberg implying that the mass murder of Jews in Auschwitz never happened? Probably not, but this scene can definitely be interpreted that way. The only conclusion I can come up with is that Spielberg intended to convey some form of relief for his audience, but since the gassings of Jews and other \\"undesireables\\" was pretty much the cornerstone of the Holocaust, it seems to me that he just copped out.  Granted there were other scenes that were difficult to watch, but if he wanted to create an accurate historical document, by some accounts, he should've portrayed the unfathomable horror of a gassing.  However difficult that might've been I'm sure the audience would've gotten the message.  This movie fails because of this scene.
B00000JLWW|5.0|This movie has everything you could ever ask for. Great acting, comedy, tragedy, romance, action, adventure. It's one of those movies where you can guess the entire plot from the first thirty minutes of the movie, but still be surprised when it comes out exactly how you thought. It's not one of those old movies where you look at it and go 'ugh' this is going to be so stupid, it's all old-fashioned. Yes, it's placed in 1912, but it looks like you would imagine everything looking. Not only will you bawl, you'll laugh, and wonder. Jack and Rose's story is one that will stay with you long after the movie has ended. I'd give this movie 38 stars if I could, but 5 was the highest it went!!!
B000B8QF14|3.0|Well... it's hard to say what sucks more, the DVD or the CD. <br />When i first saw the song list i was happy to see we are the champions, maria and many other classics. They even had the list posted in many websites, when i bought the cd/DVD it comes only with 14 tracks. The cd is alright, i dont like the sound in some songs like Wake me up When September Ends, but it's alright. <br />I dont know if it's just me, but Billy Joe makes the public sing too much... for example in Long View, when he's supposed to sing \\"When masturbation's lost its fun and im f***ing lazy\\", you dont hear much because that's the part the audience is supposed to sing. ALso the dvd must have been filmed in America, not europe, that's the whole point of the American Idiot Story... <br />This package doesnt even have a bokklet or anything, not words from the band or anything, just interviews in between songs which last for like what seems ages. <br />Overall the performance is good, but Billy Joe please dont make the audience sing, YOU are supposed to Sing, and well... over all it's not worth the 20 bucks i paid for it. <br />If i could go back in time, I wouldnt have paid and lost 20 dollars... <br />WHAT a RIP OFF!!!! <br />If you really really really really are a hardcore green day fan buy this, but if you are not... dont worry buying this, you wont enjoy it much...
0679422714|3.0|This book stands to remain the tome of first resort for most casual readers seeking to learn more about Mao Zedong. It is impressively researched, and the authors have clearly gained access to many people whose intimate knowledge of Mao has thus far remained undocumented in the English language, and only to a small degree even in Chinese. <br /> <br />However, the ultimate flaw in this book is its failure to reconcile the differences between a personal biography and a political one: the approach that worked very well in the first half of the book, recounting his personal rise to prominence and leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, is inadequate in explaining the decisions made by 'Chairman Mao' once he had been installed at the head of the government of China. <br /> <br />The narrative of 'Mao the self-serving and ruthless power seeker' gives way in 1949 to the narrative of 'Mao the ruthless tyrant'. While neither of these portrayals is wholly inaccurate, 'Mao the ruthless tyrant' is an inadequate framework within which to analyse the policy choices of the head of the most populous nation on earth. The tyrant's over-riding policy objective is laid out in vague terms as being 'to dominate the world' through massive investment and expenditure on the military in general and nuclear weapons in particular. The main effects of these policy choices are given as the irrefutable suffering that befell the Chinese populace as a result. However, 'world domination' while being an objective, is not in itself a policy; nor is massive military expenditure an end of any worth if it is not to be used to implement a coherent foreign policy. This is where the weaknesses in this book come to the fore. If the argument is that the tyrant's pursuit of a foreign policy objective was his main motivation over a quarter-century, then his foreign policy choices cannot be examined in isolation from each other and only detailed in terms of their effects on the general populace.  <br /> <br/>To use one example, when Sino-Soviet tensions reached such a peak in mid-1969 that the Russians seriously contemplated a pre-emptive nuclear strike against China's nuclear facilities, the effect of this is not given in terms of China's opening to the USA and Nixon's subsequent visit, but rather in terms of the number of Chinese who were corveed into building underground bomb shelters. Likewise, Nixon's visit is later portrayed as simply a 'P.R. stunt' of Mao's, whereby Nixon was, like so many others, duped by the dictator; the geopolitical import of this major reorientation in China's Cold War policy is not even given the most scant of treatment. Furthermore, like the distortion of the motives behind Sino-American rapprochement, Chang and Halliday's dating of the origins of this process is inaccurate. <br /> <br />Overall, this book is a useful insight into the personality and character of Mao Zedong, and also his most dangerous of accomplices, Zhou Enlai. However, for anyone seeking to gain an understanding or explanation of the policy choices made during Mao's 27-year regime, this book tells no story at all.  <br /> <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|She truly is a Pop Goddess Phenom! By far her best and most exciting work since Ray of Light, Madonna pushes ahead to the future with her own brand of killer, and totally danceable, pop music. The entire album engulfs the listener in beautiful sound - it seems the entire cosmos was captured in making this record. It pulses through you and you can't help but move to the groove. Almost every track on this masterpiece is worthy of chart topping success. The lyrics are clever and the production is out of this world. My personal fav's are Isaac, Jump, Sorry, Future Lovers, and Hung Up. To those who were left weeping by the American Life spectacle there is no need to be cautious, with Confessions, for there is NO \\"folktronica\\" to be found on this album. This is the Madonna you have been waiting for - back to her \\"roots\\" but moving forward at the same time. Pure magic - pure Madonna.

B000301YY8|4.0|James Blunt's \\"Back to Bedlam\\" is a gorgeous CD.  This young former British soldier's melodic sense weaves unique tunes with intelligent lyrics while his vocals deliver them with an expressive and emotional tremble.  \\"You're Beautiful\\" spent five weeks at #1 on the British singles charts.  A romantic glance in a crowded subway makes a young man's heart flutter, thinking of the possibilities love might offer, \\"Yeah, she caught my eye as we walked on by.  She could see from my face that I was f**king high, and I don't think that I'll see her again, but we shared a moment that will last till the end.\\"  The 3rd track is my next favorite with its fluid melody and Jimmy Hogarth's delightful keyboard flares that jut in & out of the arrangement, \\"And they're really sorry now for what they've done, They were three Wise Men just trying to have some fun.\\"  The other tracks on the disc are also consistently strong.  \\"So Long, Jimmy\\" has Blunt's voice fluttering into falsetto before it plants itself firmly in a lower range, \\"Does everyone have a different take?  Are you just cool & I'm just baked?  Does everyone get mesmerized by your fire?\\"  \\"Back to Bedlam\\" is an excellent freshman set from this fine singer.  Enjoy!
B000957O82|4.0|The movie is one of the better comedys from the past year (along with Harold and Kumar go to White Castle).  This movie has its bright moments and some of the film reminded me of Eddie Murphy's Nutty Professor and Boomerang.  Will Smith is entertaining as the date doctor who secretly helps a lot of guys win girls that they would never have a chance with otherwise.  His big assignment is to help a basically nice though \\"bumbling\\" guy win the heart of a Paris Hilton type heiress.  Many of the training scenes were in the trailer but are still extremely entertaining seeing them again in the film. <br /> <br />My one big problem with the film and the reason it didn't rate 5 stars is that I saw a lack of real chemistry between Smith and Eva Mendez (the gossip columnist who is looking for the elusive date doctor and wants to expose him because her friend was hurt by one of his clients).  Granted the exchange between the two during their first meeting in a bar is excellent.  From there on it seems like there is nothing there especially during the times when Mendez acts really weird in front of Smith.
B00005JOGU|5.0|This film has got to be the best movie I've seen this year. The acting was flawless, the ambiance and the cinematography were just perfect, and I felt like I was there with the characters. Phillip Seymour Hoffman MUST win the Oscar for his brilliant performance in this film. As a fellow reviewer rightfully indicated, Hoffman did not portray Truman Capote, he *became* Truman Capote. I found myself feeling sympathy for the killers toward the end of the film and ended up crying over how sad and pathetic Capote's life really was, underneath all the glamour and pretentions. This is a must-see now and a must-buy when it comes out on DVD. I will definitely see it again. Highly  recommended!!!
B000ANVQ0K|1.0|According to all sources viewed so far, the new 3-disc DVD is supposed to be ANAMORPHIC. <br /> <br />IT IS NOT!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />I just purchased it at Best buy, and spot-checked it tonight. <br /> <br />I AM HORRIFIED!!!!! <br /> <br />This is a VHS style crappy ultra-letterboxed transfer to DVD.  Believe you me, I have an expensive 16x9 widescreen TV I bought just to watch anamorphic DVD's since I can't get High Def from my cable company. <br /> <br />When I watch an anamorphic DVD, it looks almost as good as high def.  I am a film editor and post production supervisor in Burbank Ca., and know what I'm talking about. <br /> <br />TITANIC has ultra-letterboxing and is presented FLAT.  On a wide-screen TV you have to press the zoom button twice to fill the screen, resulting in about a 30 % enlargement of the NTSC frame to get rid of the letterboxing. <br /> <br />THIS RELEASE OF TITANIC IS A TITANIC RIP-OFF TO THE PUBLIC, AND  I WILL NOT REST UNTIL I CAN GET A FULL AND REASONABLE EXPLAINATION FROM ALL PARTIES INVOLVED. <br /> <br />I've already posted to Mr.Cameron on IMDB this evening, and tomorrow, Nov 21, I'm calling my contacts at Ascent Media in Burbank where the transfer (and the encoding?) was done to get some answers.  I'll report back here and the IMDB. <br /> <br />In the meantime, if you have a real TV (a widescreen HD 16x9), don't waste your money on this CRAP!

B000AY74OG|3.0|Ben Stiller (Zoolander, Envy), Chris Rock (Dogma, Longest Yard), <br />David Schwimmer (Duane Hopwood, Friends), Jada Pinkett Smith (Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions), Sascha Baren Cohen (The Ali G Show), Andy Richter (Big Trouble, Dr. T and The Women) and Cedric The Entertainer (Be Cool, Man of the House) lend their voices to this funny comedy which kids will eat it up like hot cakes, which also has adult themes in it as well. A Zebra (Rock) wants to go out into the wild when he finds out the psychotic Penguins are gonna try to escape from the zoo to go to Antartica, so he busts loose and his animal friends, A Lion (Stiller), A Hippo (Smith) and A Giraffe (Schwimmer) go after him but they get caught, along with the Penguins and Monkeys and are shipped off back to their mainland. But then, the Penguins take over the ship making The Lion, The Zebra, The Hippo and The Giraffe go over board and wind up on the sandy beach of Madagascar where they meet Lemur friends. Some pretty funny dialouge from the actors....the greatest thing is watching the Penguins...and their even funny in the small little movie A Christmas Caper. Not the best animated movie but it sure was funny watching The Penguins.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|Directed by Len Wiseman, starring Kate Beckinsdale and Scott Speedman and largely filmed in Budapest, \\"Underworld\\" hit the big screen in 2003. It's a very stylish `monster' movie, though - a little unusually - humans are neither the heroes nor the victims. (The film doesn't stop for 'lunch').       Beckinsdale plays Selene, our 'heroine' and the 'good' vampire. She's a Death Dealer - a vampire soldier - in a war against werewolves that has lasted for around a thousand years. As time has passed, the weapons used by both races have been updated - there are no stakes or crossbows in sight, while the traditional silver bullet has been modified. The current battles are being waged with throwing stars, guns and grenades - all enhanced to target the specific weaknesses of the intended victim. However, tradition hasn't been entirely sacrificed - vampires are still stylish and pale, while the vampire clan still lives in an old-fashioned, classy mansion. (Like the weapons, however, it does incorporate some 'modern' aspects). Selene very much looks to Viktor for guidance - Viktor is one of the vampires' three elders and something of a father figure to Selene. However, as the film opens, he is in hibernation and the day-to-day running of the vampires' affairs are in Kraven's hands. Kraven, somewhat power-hungry, also has designs on Selene - however, she ins't even remotely interested - she regularly disobeys his instructions and doesn't believe a great deal of what he has to say.     Werewolves have officially been on the defensive for around 600 years, since Kraven killed their greatest leader, Lucien. However, they have never been fully defeated and, from early in the film, it seems the vampires have been lulled into a false sense of security. As well as the updated weapons, werewolves - or lycans, as they're known throughout the film - can now transform at will and no longer have to wait on the full moon. They appear to be in full control of their actions and can also heal more quickly while in wolf form. Where the vampires are pale and stylish, the werewolves are more animal-like and live underground. However, this hasn't stopped them performing 'medical research', with a particular interest in a family called Corvin. As the film opens, a couple of werewolves are stalking Speedman's character, a doctor called Michael Corvin. Selene, who's been on patrol and sees what's happening, is puzzled by this - it's clear the werewolves aren't just hunting for food. Her interest develops much further as the film progresses to the point of romance. This brings her a great deal of trouble when it becomes apparent the werewolves have 'turned' Michael. (It's also brought the comparisons with 'Romeo and Juliet' - a romance between two warring houses). As a result of the romance, she learns a great deal more about the origins of war and the night she was sired by Viktor.      This is a very enjoyable and stylish film, with some very impressive special effects. Although technically, I suppose, it's a 'supernatural' movie, there's a strong thriller element to it, with plenty of gunfights, political intruige, treachery, twists and turns...and if that's not enough, it's also got Kate Beckinsdale !! Absolutely recommended for those who love vampire movies. However, despite the comparisons with 'Romeo and Juliet', I can't really see it convincing your Shakespeare-loving aunt to start watching the Hammer films.
B00005JO1P|5.0|I have always been intrigued by Joaquin Phoenix but this performance blew me away. He just WAS John, a performer I liked but didn't know a lot about as he was a little before my time.

I have been telling everyone how great I think it is and I'll be seeing it again.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This cd is excellent! Mariah came back big time with the \\"Emancipation of Mimi\\", selling over 400,000 copies of this cd in its first week released, which more than any of her past cds in her career. I must admit that I was really surprised that it did so well because all of her lackluster reviews from previous work like \\"glitter\\" and her having fallen off. But this girl came back, and came back good! The best songs on here are, of course, \\"We Belong Together\\", the second single released, \\"Your girl\\", which is so tight to death. This song is such a nice, sweet, and lovely song that the only regret is that it is too short at only 2:48. \\"Say something\\" with Snoop Doggy Dog is hot and should have gotten more airplay, but never mind that because the album is doing more than well. \\"Stay the night\\" is also a nice song with catchy tunes and a soft melody, \\"circles\\" and \\"I wish you knew\\" are also songs that do it great for the cd. Please don't for any reason doubt this album. Mariah proved that falling off is not forever and that if she was great once then she will be great again-and she has. I am so happy that Mariah has triumphed over her hard times and has made it back twice as good. She has a beautiful voice that is so strong and amazing, and it's good that she is here to share it with the whole world. My little sister even blasts this cd and she is 12 and I am 23. Mariah keep on doing it! Grade: A+
B000BGH22W|5.0|I buy a soundtrack when I'm sitting enthralled by a movie but keep perking my ears for the music. That's why I bought this soundtrack. I know my John Williams, and I could tell without being told that he had not done the score. While Williams has created the most memorable themes in movie history (even my sixth graers who were born in the nineties know \\"Superman\\" and \\"Star Wars\\" when they hear them), I haven't heard this kind of passion from him since \\"Jurassic Park.\\" Patrick Doyle has done wonders during a time when, honestly, soundtracks fail to be fun anymore, with rare exceptions (\\"Lord of the Rings\\").<br /><br />If you search for the movies Doyle has composed music for, you'll find a common thread--\\"Henry V\\" (1989); \\"Great Expectations\\"; \\"Quest For Camelot\\"; \\"Hamlet\\" (1996); \\"Much Ado About Nothing.\\" His resume is, for me, what makes him perfect as the scorer of the latest Potter music. Witchcraft and wizardry will always be linked with the ancient, and the medievel, and you can hear that style in this soundtrack, and it lends a timelessness and greater sense of maturity to the movie.<br /><br />Because the movie itself has so many dark moments, much of the soundtrack is that way as well. The beginning track \\"The Story Continues\\" sets the stage for recurring themes that have their origins in Doyle, not Williams. He slips in more heaviness in tracks like \\"The Quidditch World Cup\\" for the arrival of the Bulgarians, but we can't overlook the whimsy of the start of the same track, which heralds the Irish. There is exquisite beauty in \\"Harry in Winter\\" and its theme finds its way into \\"Hogwarts' March.\\" \\"Neville's Waltz\\" and \\"Potter Waltz\\" provide more relief from the darkness; however, tracks like \\"Golden Egg\\" and \\"Voldemort\\" manage wonderful transitions from light to dark and vice versa.<br /><br />It seems that the majority of listeners enjoyed the soundtrack from the last movie; I can't comment on that, as I have not heard it, nor the two that came before it. I was never moved during the movie to purchase them, the way I was with GOF. Perhaps it is just that I am partial to the grandeur of music that is made to fit all the marvels of things of a time past. But isn't that what the Harry Potter books do, too? A mixture of ancient spells and wisdom with modern day inventions and slang. Doyle, it is evident, understands that synthesis.<br /><br />A last note: each track is separate, which is indeed nice when you like a beginning and end to your music. There was a small trend in soundtracks for a while, like that of \\"Gladiator,\\" in which all the tracks ran together, and it was annoying. Nothing to worry about here.was never moved during the movie to purchase them, the way I was with GOF.

You don't have to navigate a confusing wheel (I tried to read Sherilyn Fenn's credits but I couldn't.  Definitely get this one!

0307276902|5.0|As an author myself, and a Flight attendant with lots of time to read...on layovers...I'm always looking for the next good book.  One way I determine \\"the next good book\\" is to watch what my passengers bring on the airplane to read.  Then I ask them if they like the book and to give me a short review. If more than one passenger is reading the same book - I note that and if several are reading the same book - I note that and think, wow, there must be something to this book.  On my last flight most of the readers were reading the same book A MILLION LITTLE PIECES, by James Frey.<br /><br />And they were all deeply and profoundly touched by the book.<br /><br />And while they all RAVED about the book, their reviews all came with warnings.  \\"The book is edgy, and sobering (no pun intended)\\".<br /><br />So, I decided to check the book out, but because I believe in the old pharse 'it's not what you say, it's the way that you say it...'I wanted to read a taste of Frey's writing before I spent my money, so I went to Amazon.com and searched inside the book.  I was instantly hooked.  Ordered it and then the book arrived and I can't put it down.  But, like other amazon.com reviewers here - I HAD to occassionaly put the book down, and step back and breath and deal with the sad/hard/real/devistating things Frey has to say.<br /><br />I lOVED HIS FIRST PERSON TENSE WRITING!  LOVED IT.  And I praise the editor who left it in it's tense!<br /><br />I have never been in a Detox center, or known anyone who was addicted to anything stronger than food, or shopping - at least anyone who wanted to talk about their addiction.  And unlike Frey, (who disdains Christianity) I have a deep abiding faith.  But, I have to tell you that of all the books I've ever read about pain and overcoming a past which weighs us down - (which I am working to do)...of all the books I've ever read about difficult times and rising above those times, other than the Bible - Frey's book has helped me most!  It has helped me realize that blaming others for times I was a victim is futile.  It has helped me understand why my friend who weighs 300 lbs at 5'4\\" and has already had stomach reduction surgery and then overroad that surgery, really does mean it when she says she can't help it -- that she really believes she has no control over her weight.  Frey's book has helped me see inside the mind of someone who is addicted.  And I am grateful.  I am so grateful, I want to say, a prayer, \\"Dear God, thank you for this book.  And O God, let other's read it and be helped.  And God, please let James Frey stay sober.  And Jesus, even your own brother's didn't believe in you, so I know you understand when James Frey doesn't believe in you either.  Amen.

1932100385|5.0|This is the kind of information the American public has needed for a long, long time. This is the most comprehensive book on the relationship between nutrition and health I have ever read. I intend to provide my family members with a copy, especially my son in law who is a doctor. I just hope and pray that people will read this excellant work and follow the recommendations it provides. Americans do not have to die from heart disease and cancer and diabetes. Americans do not have to be obese and unfit. This book tells us what the problem is, and what we can do about it if we have the courage and good sense to change. And maybe the best part is that it is simple and inexpensive to do with no risks involved. I am grateful to all those who have had a part in making this available to the American public.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|Well I saw this extended edition when it first aired on Fox years ago as a Universal Theater Special Presentation. It has also been aired on the Sci-Fi channel several times as well. The opening dialogue was not delivered by Princess Irulan, and was longer, giving you more of the history of the universe including the Butlerian Jihad against the machines. The narrator was male, and some say delivered by David Lynch himself, I cannot confirm nor deny this rumor. Another reviewer wrote that the \\"cut\\" scenes were cutting room floor junk. That is not true. They are rougher than the theatrical footage but were intended to be part of a 6 hour version with a planned intermission. After several screenings, the 6 hour version was cut to 137 minutes (2 hours 17 minutes) loosing much of Lynch's planned vision of Dune. The 6 hour version was only test screened a few times and never fully re-mastered as it would have been if, sent to the theaters. This is why that added footage appears rougher, as only the film was given the proper processing, the dialogue would have been re-processed if the 6 hour movie had been approved to hit theaters. It was not, and only the 2 hour and 17 minutes of theatrical release footage was properly processed for theater sound. If we were able to see the 6 hour version, I'm sure it would be a great ride, but since the time on this edition is 177 minutes (2 hours 57 minutes) it is likely the same version aired on Fox years ago, where they advertised it as having 50 minutes of extra footage (actually only 40). The opening dialogue is delivered with still paintings of scenes from the past where the machines took over and enslaved the human race. There are some storyboard scenes also in the opening narrative, as the narrator comments on current events. I did like this version and I hope they were able to re-master the additional footage so it better matches the theatrical footage. Some of the sound on the Fox airing was muted and mono, so I hope they wereable to fix this as well. It is because of the roughness of the added footage that David Lynch pulled his name off the TV version. Alan Smithee is the Director, in Hollywood, when any director pulls their name off a project he is billed as Alan Smithee. Several other people pulled their names of the TV project also, including the writer and the editor I believe and perhaps a few others as well. They also have names in Hollywood for writers and editors who pull their names from movies, but I forget what they are. On my edition of the Theatrical Release DVD there are some places where the color has faded on the film, particularly when Paul addresses the 100 fremen he will teach the Weirding Way too. In the upper left hand part of my screen (near Paul's head) the film has faded, and was not on the first DVD I had, nor on the VHS tape edition. I hope universal was able to address this problem as I understand that the extended version will offer both the theatrical release and the extended versions. I hope they are on separate discs also as I hate those slight pauses on dual layered DVDs. There is also an alternative ending and other deleted scenes. Of the alternative ending I do hope they show where Thufir passes away as he forgot to milk his cat for the antidote, this is how the book ended. I can't wait to see the other deleted scenes, and I can only imagine what they may contain. All in all you won't be disappointed with this edition, the movie offers more insight into the Dune universe as first imagined by Frank Herbert. The only thing you'll find in the movie that is NOT in the book are the Weirding Modules. Now the Weirding Way IS in the book, and it is this method of fighting that Paul and Jessica pledge to teach the Fremen in order to gain their protection from the Harkonnen who are once again in control of Dune. The Weirding Modules that work through the Weirding Way using thought, sound and motion are an update, and I think they work well in the movie. Paul, after destroying an obsidian obelisk with the Weirding Module-- \\"This is part of the Weirding Way that we will teach you. Some thoughts have a certain sound, that being the equivalent to a form. Through sound and motion...you will be able to paralyze nerves, shatter bones, set fires, suffocate an enemy or burst his organs. We will kill until no Harkonnen breathes Arakeen air.\\" It is an afterthought yes, but when I read the book, I found it hard to believe that the fremen with simple maula pistols and crysknives could overthrow the Emperor and kill 10 legions of Sardaukar Terror Troops. The Weirding Modules along with the Weirding Way give the Fremen the available power to defeat the Sardaukar and the Emperor, and I find it to be a more believable ending than the book version. Otherwise David Lynch did very well to bring the book (almost word for word) to the big screen. Even the italicized thoughts in the book are realized in the film, giving you the reader/watcher insight into what that character is thinking. Someday hopefully Dino will release the actual 6 hour cut that was the intended vision for us to see. I am sure he's holding onto it, in Hollywood now a days, you don't throw anything away, otherwise you'll have no extras for your movie's DVD release. I hope this review helped you, and please feel free to leave your own comments on top.

B000BO0LLS|3.0|Forking out more cash for an extra 4 tracks is hardly worth it. The DVD isn't anything special either. However, for all the people who don't know or haven't been around long enough, the JD track \\"Makin' It Last All Night\\" samples Jodeci's Freek 'N You Remix featuring Ghostface Killer and Raekwon. Good to hear a classic re-used in this remix. The remix of So Lonely featuring Twista also worth listening too. Decision is yours! <br />
1591791707|5.0|I read the book and liked it so much I bought the tapes for my dad.  They are definalty just as good as the book.  It can show more understanding and ways of communicating with people than my psychology degree has taught me. <br />I would recommend this to anyone.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|If you are a fan of Madonna, you will find this album very interesting. However be careful, cause if you are missing somewhere Madonna's beat, you may not like it. I think it's great, but much different from Madonna's style. As we all probably know, she is unusual and unique and all her previous albums are different from one another. <br />Have fun
B00005JLPK|3.0|Hard to rate this movie on the Amazon \\"star\\" system.  I don't think Selma Hayek is a great actress -- beautiful woman; a beautiful presence, and there's lots of feeling in her performance here -- but, Alfred Molina as Diego Rivera acts rings around her.  He's the linchpin of the movie; he inhabits this role completely and he IS Diego Rivera.  Selma Hayek's performance as Frida can't compare to that type of acting.  She's \\"like\\" Frida Kahlo, but she's still Selma Hayek playing Frida Kahlo.<br /><br />Some scenes are brilliantly conceived (particularly, the bus accident and its aftermath).  The film tries hard to show the vibrant connection between Frida's art and Frida's life, but these moments give way in favor of a more standard, Hollywood-ized feel, especially toward the end of the film.  Also, Frida's politics are ignored, in favor of her love/hate story with Diego.  She was a much richer character, with a much more fascinating life, than this film can encompass.<br /><br />Julie Taymor does bring some of the flavor of Frida's life to the screen.  The film is enjoyable.  However, anyone with a serious interest in Frida Kahlo should read her biography or study her work.  Don't depend on this film for more than a glance at this artist's painful, yet wonderfully creative life.
038572179X|2.0|This book was extremely difficult to read, and I frankly couldn't force myself to read past part 1. I found it boring and tedious and uninteresting. The writing made me think of Nathaniel Hawthorne if he'd taken a boring pill. Obviously some people like it though, but I personally can't find anything in it.
0425152251|4.0|Sophie's World by Jostein Gaarder is a great read.  The book starts out with a 14-year old girl named Sophie receiving letters of philosophy study in the mail.  The instructor didn't want to reveal his identity at first, but he gradually opened himself to Sophie, and showed himself to Sophie first through videotape.  It is kind of weird how a 14-year old is meeting up with a 40-50 year old man alone.  I was surprised that her mom didn't stop her from meeting this guy in the first place.  The plot is an interesting read though.  Instead of just giving out information of philosophers, and making readers bored, there's a side plot with the lessons.  It also shows how a 14-year old reacts to these philosophical ideas.  Throughout the book it made me think of my own beliefs.  I learned a lot of changes through the centuries of how people's mind changed.  I was surprised that some philosophers were not included in the book.  It was hard getting through the first part of the book, since nothing kept me interesting.  Some parts like the lego theory was fun to read.  This book is easy to understand, and I recommend this book, if you want an informational but brief summary of a well-known philosopher.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|If you plan on buying \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" then I would encourage you to get the ULTRA PLATINUM EDITION. This is by far the best version of this album. I LOVE the extra songs \\"Don't Forget About Us,\\" \\"Makin' It Last All Night,\\" \\"So Lonely,\\" and \\"We Belong Together - Remix.\\" All of the videos look absolutely TERRIFIC. Don't let the 1-star reviews scare you away from buying this. <br /> <br />Mariah Carey has not released \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" 4 times. This album has only been re-released once. She's already sold 3.7M copies. So her label would have to print a 5th million anyways. So what difference does it make if the 5th million is a deluxe edition or expanded version? The people who haven't bought it are really getting the best deal. You get 18 songs plus a DVD with her videos.  <br /> <br />This re-release is not unusual. Many artists are releasing a regular version and a DualDisc (CD/DVD glued together) version on the same day. The difference with Mariah, she didn't have the 4 extra songs at the time or the 4 music videos. She never could have done \\"The Emancipation of Mimi -Ultra Platinum Edition\\" as a DualDisc in the same way that she has now. The CD + DVD is better. And there would be absolutely no logic in releasing this as an EP. <br /> <br />But I would support retailers like Target, Best Buy, Circuit City, Wal-Mart, and Tower Records. They have more integrity than this joke of an internet company. They spotlight one-star reviews of all the people that they don't like or are jealous of.
6304712499|5.0|Spawn Is the best Dark Superhero movie i ever saw. The Special effects are so Hellish awesome. The Clown was one of my favorite characters, because he was so funny. Who would thought that the villian would be the comic Releaf. This Movie Rocks.<br /><br />If You Liked this movie check out The Animated Spawn Movies & Check out the Novel & Listen To The Soundtrack
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album is a true return to form for Madonna, not that she has ever really left us unsatisfied.  Even those who did not like American Life can appreciate that is was not meant to be a pop-delight.  It was a sincere reflection on the chaos and confusion of the past few years.  With Confessions, Madonna returns to fans with a FUN version of Ray Of Light.  The production is spectacular, much props to Price for a job well done.  With probably 7 single-worthy tracks, the album is also Madonna's return to the general public.  Non-Madonna fans will no-doubt be grooving to Sorry and Get Together at a club-near-you in no time.  Other than a few relative clunkers (I Love New York, which only stumbles on it's lyrics; Let it Will Be, How High and maybe Like it or Not) this is all classic Madonna material.  And this is not to say that these are bad songs, they just don't stand to the level set by tracks such as Sorry, Get Together (which is being called her best recording in years), Jump and Future Lovers, which turns a Donna Summers 'I Feel Love' groove into an spacey chant of 'Give Me Evidence of Its Brilliance'.  The evidence is there, Confessions is a top notch pop album that shows why Madonna will always have her place among the top pop icons of our time, male or female.
B0007GAERG|4.0|The Emancipation of Mimi is a good comeback effort from one of the greatest female singers. Filled with delightful R&B ballads, catchy beats and good song writing, Mariah Carey's new album shows that the diva is back and better than ever.  <br />Favourties in this album include \\"we belong together\\", \\"Fly like a bird\\", \\"Joy Ride\\" and \\"Shake it off\\". The lyrics are fantastic and the unique style that is Mariah Carey is in every song on this album. Unfortunately her whispery falsetto and some strain in the vocal cords can be heard in particular songs, but generally, Mariah's powerhouse vocals and almighty range that we used to love are back in \\"The Emancipation of mimi\\".  <br />This album is highly recommended
0553801503|2.0|As I finally came to the last hundred or so pages, I just couldn't wait for this book to be over.  It is 684 pages of nothing but minor characters, and minor deaths, with no plot advancement.  Having a character run around doing nothing for hundreds of pages only to die at the end is pointless.  I'm just so frustrated.  To save you the long hours it will take to read this, I will quickly summarize each character's story.    Arya - She is hardly in the book at all and when she is she is selling oysters in Bravos     Brienne - She wanders around aimlessly accomplishing absolutely nothing.  The reader doesn't even learn anything important that he/she didn't already know.    Cersei - Each of her chapters follows a similar format of \\"Jamie is not my lover anymore\\", \\"I'm afraid of the prophecy\\", and concluded with her making an obviously stupid decision that she thought was rather cunning.    Jamie - Thinks about his sister and travels to Riverrun    Samwell - Took the entire book to do nothing but travel from The Wall to Oldtown    Sansa - Like Arya she is also hardly in the book and does a whole lot of nothing       Random minor characters - Add nothing but secondary stories that better prove to have some significance with the amount of pages they wasted.    What is even worse is that I can't imagine the next book will be any better.  If Dance of Dragons is supposed to occur at the exact same time as Feast of Crows what could it possibly accomplish?  We know Danny didn't cross the sea.  We know the Others haven't crossed The Wall yet.  We know Lord Stannis doesn't attack Kings Landing.  How can there be any real plot advancement?  The first three books were so great, yet this series apparently decided it wanted to emulate the recent Wheel of Time and Harry Potter books instead.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Slipknot review  <br />By: Mr. Hann (Roman) <br />Slipknot is a band from Iowa that defies metal, rock and rap in many ways. They always have their own opinion about things. They have amazing guitar riffs in the songs, \\"Before I Forget\\" and \\"Duality\\". On the other hand the songs, \\"The Nameless\\" and \\"Vermillion pt.2\\" have a different twist. \\"The Nameless\\" is a more rap/metal song. The song \\"Vermillion pt.2\\" is very quiet and has a very nice melody to it. But, as any Slipknot fan would say, screw that, Slipknot is a very good metal band. They rock! I don't know anyone who hasn't listened to one of Slipknot's songs and said, \\"I hate them\\". Everyone likes them because they are rap/metal. Some of the best songs by Slipknot are, \\"Vermillion pt.2\\", \\"Duality\\", \\"Before I Forget\\" and \\"Circle\\". The album \\"Slipknot Vol.3 (The Subliminal Verses)\\" is an amazing album. It consists of all Slipknots' strengths. It has rap/metal, metal, rock and soft rock. Yes, their riffs aren't very difficult, but give them credit, no one can play as difficult riffs as Metallica and Extreme can play. They are still hard and good. They can make you say, `hey rock and rap do go together'. They are a band in which some people can hate, but who cares, everyone has an opinion. It's like this review; you can choose to look at it, but you also don't have to. Those who do choose to read it rock and those who don't; screw you!
0802130208|1.0|This book is a masterpiece of blockheads describing other blockheads, and yet failing to give us any vision of triumph over the stupidity. While many consider it funny, I found the jokes quite stale and the characterizations so blindly obvious that they'd even be out of place on South Park. When does the anti-dunce show up? It's not the protagonist nor, seemingly, the author. I can find no shortage of people overflowing with praise for this tepid hulk of verbiage, but to this experienced reader, it's like bad TV made by hopeless people for an audience of depressed, not very smart people. I would not recommend this to anyone.
0307276902|2.0|I found the story very difficult to believe.  Particularly <br />when it came to oral surgery without anesthesia.  For those <br />who seek a much more revealing story of addiction and recovery, <br />I recommend Augusten Burroughs \\"Dry\\".
B000B8QEZG|5.0|It always takes me a little bit to adjust to a new Madonna CD since each one has its own unique sound.  But after a couple of spins I am ranking this album up with Ray of Light as own of her best.  The production is simply amazing.  At first I was afraid that the continuous mix would make it difficult to skip songs, but who needs to when the songs are all brilliant.  My favorite songs are Hung Up, Sorry, Future Lovers, Let It Will Be, Jump, How High, Isaac, Push, and Like It Or Not.  Notice I have only left three songs off the list.  Those ones are awesome as well.  I just felt like it would be stupid to list them all.  But it's that good.  None of my friends like to dance, though, so I just find myself dancing all alone Silence of the Lambs style. Ah Well. Buy the album and get into the creepy basement groove.
0345446798|2.0|The basic idea is good, that dogs and humans communicate differently and that we sometimes think we are expressing affection but our canine friend may not interpret it as such.<br /><br />It seems to me that the description was however somewhat oversimplified and there was little on how to put it to practical use.
B000056HE9|5.0|Somehow, over the years, this spectacularly well-acted and truly heartwarming and original Christmas-themed movie has been forgotten by the general public and today is largely the province of film buffs and true Christmas enthusiasts.  My wife and I are a little of both, and discovering this classic a few years back was the high point of our Christmas season.<br /><br />David Niven plays an unsure, slightly skeptical, newly-minted Episopal Bishop in one of those classic 1946-ish snowy Northeast USA metropoli.  Loretta Young is his loving wife, who he increasingly ignores under the pressure of his job and a near-obsession with building a new cathedral.<br /><br />Niven prays for help and suddenly there is Dudley, played by Cary Grant as a handsome and slightly-impish angel.  Dudley must help patch up a family filled with unrequited love, help the Bishop rediscover his true faith and mission, and fight his own Angelic temptations towards mortal love.<br /><br />On the way, Dudley has some wonderful interactions with Elsa Lanchester, as the maid, and Monty Wooley as the Professor.<br /><br />The film is heartwarming and touching, with wonderful touches of wit and some excellent cinematography.<br /><br />You'll want to get this and watch it every year.
B000BNI99K|5.0|I've never been much of a Rod Stewart fan, but I absolutely love these albums!  I heard my son playing them, and was immediately enticed and had to have the boxed set. They bring back memories of my father telling me about the big open-air dance theater that he used to go to back in the 40's and 50's.  He told me there was magic at these dances with the moon and stars, beautiful music, beautiful girls, and romance in the air.  They were the place to go and romance your sweetheart.  This boxed set of four CD's contains elegant and classy renditions of old American classic favorites from a romantic era when music was special and the lyrics and melodies meant something.  The boxed set also contains a short DVD and a photo and story insert about the creation of this series of great American classics. It is hard to pick any favorites in these CD's, because I love all the songs.  Some of my favorites are \\"It Had to Be You\\", \\"Moonglow\\", \\"I'll Be Seeing You\\", \\"Smile\\", \\"As Time Goes By\\" (featuring Queen Latifah), \\"Stardust\\", \\"Isn't It Romantic\\", \\"Long Ago and Far Away\\", and \\"Let's Fall In Love\\".  The orchestrations and contributing artists are top-notch.  The only song that I would have liked to see another artist perform with Rod on is \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\", which he sings with Dolly Parton.  Her squeaky, hillbilly voice just sent chills down my spine, like scratching your fingernails on a blackboard.  It just doesn't lend well to these classy songs.  It is evident in the span of the CD's how Stewart's voice and the arrangments of the music evolve to become better and smoother.  Some people might say that Stewart's voice doesn't lend well to this type of music, but not any more so than Louis Armstrong's voice did when he sang the classics.  Stewart sings with a passion that makes each song meaningful and special. This genre was a great transition for Stewart to change to after his Pop/Rock career. So light the fire, fix that special dinner, break out the wine and candles, and slow dance with your sweetheart to these magical melodies that will take you away to a very romantic place.  I have listened to these CD's over and over since purchasing them, and they have definitely become some of my favorites. Stewart comments that he has no plans to continue with the great American classics series he has started, but I sincerely hope that he will decide to make more of these CD's.  He has touched my heart and soul with these beautiful melodies, and you won't be disappointed with these treasures!
B000AGTPUA|4.0|Whether you're like my wife and I and accumulate another Christmas movie or two every year, or whether you are just putting one DVD in the stocking, the Polar Express is a good choice to add to or start your collection!<br /><br />Director Robert Zemeckis uses an all-digital technology that captures real-life motion, and all of the latest computer effects to create a visual feast.  The plot is about a doubting young boy who joins a trainful of skeptics for a Christmas Eve journey to the North Pole.  It is a benign, politcally-correct, and fun tale, suitable for children.<br /><br />The effects will enthrall kids and adults.  The North Pole has a wonderful Northest-USA city of the 1920's look and the train almost steals the show.  Locomotive 1225 (get it?) is a digitalization with real sound recordings from real-life Pere Marquette engine 1225 which escaped the scrapper's torch in part because of that number.<br /><br />But if there is a show-stealer, it is Tom Hanks, who lends his voice and visage to five characters, most notably the hobo and the conductor.<br /><br />This isn't the best Christmas film ever made (my vote goes to \\"the Bishop's Wife\\" or the George C. Scott version of A Christmas Carol) but Polar Express IS a worthy addition to the pantheon!
B0002S94OS|5.0|Lamb Of God has been around the music scene since 1998, and out of their four albums (the first of which was under the name Burn The Priest), they've never received the recognition they deserved. Their 2004 release, Ashes Of The Wake finally gave them  the wide spread exposure they needed. To assist in those matters, they opened for Slipknot on the Subliminal Verses Tour. Their performance in that tour was sure to open many eyes to the musical prowess they so effortlessly display.<br /><br />Lamb Of God came around at exactly the right time; many have dubbed them \\"the new wave of heavy metal\\", and due to this particular genre of metal's past decline, some have even deemed them saviors. Although the five members of Lamb Of God, Randy Blythe (vocals), Mark Morton (guitar), Willie Adler (guitar), Chris Adler (drums) and John Campbell (bass), claim they started the band for \\"the love of getting drunk,\\" they obviously love their line of work as well.<br /><br />Since Lamb of God's first album, they have steadily improved and refined their sound. Perhaps the biggest improvement in Ashes Of The Wake compared to their previous efforts is that the vocals are much more clear, making Blythe's voice sound more concise and powerful. The guitar work is nothing short of brilliant, and the drumming can only be described as amazing.<br /><br />Ashes Of The Wake starts off with their first single of this album, \\"Laid To Rest.\\" The guitar work bares an uncanny resemblance to Testament's \\"Into The Pit.\\" This is not a cheap knock off however, it is more of a homage to one of their influences. The next song, \\"Hourglass,\\" contains hard hitting riffs and a solo of sorts that makes you wonder how many fingers each guitarist has. No album would be complete without a crowd pleaser, making \\"Now You've Got Something To Die For\\" sure to be every concert goer's mantra for the evening. This sort of assault continues for a total of eleven tracks, only slowing briefly in the introduction to \\"Omerta,\\" for a recitation of the rule of honor. This song continues into a slower chugging, groove oriented song. The only real relief comes from the closing track, \\"Remorse For The Dead,\\" which starts slow and ominous using smooth guitars and light drumming. It soon turns into heavy ominous riffs and vocals to match.<br /><br />On a personal note, this album will probably always hold a special place in my heart as the first real introduction to this \\"new wave of heavy metal.\\" I cannot think of any other album to offer as good an introduction and because of it I am glad to be part of this chapter in music history.e rule of honor.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|I have listened to this album a lot since I bought it a few days ago, and I really really love it. Madonna definitely put out a stronger and more focused album this time, when compared to American Life. I think an all-dance album is just what Madonna needed, although I sort of miss her ballads, I believe she is just a stronger artist when she is making dance recordings. As far as people saying that her creativity level is at an all-time low because she sampled Abba's Man of the Midnight for her first single, this is what most artists do nowadays people! I mean, you can only keep making so many new songs before you have no choice but to at least borrow melodies from previous songs. I mean, what can you honestly play nowadays that doesn't at least sound similar to something that has already been recorded years ago?<br /><br />As far as the album's content, I am noticing a lot of lyrics that are similar to songs in American Life, especially when she is questioning whether or not her fame and what she went through to get it was \\"worth it\\". And, \\"nobody's perfect, I guess I deserve it\\", was taken directly from American Life. Madonna has definitely done songs before where she questions her own success, and whether she got to where she is today the right way or not. All I am saying is I have definitely heard some of these lyrics before, and I feel that maybe Madonna didn't really have a whole lot to say with the release of this album, instead I feel she is reinforcing ideas that she has sung about in the past.<br /><br />Regardless of its message, this is still one powerful dance album that is sure to get anyone with a pulse out on the dance floor. My favorite songs are Hung Up, Get Together, Sorry, Forbidden Love, How High, & Like It Or Not. However, they are all great songs. Nice job Madonna!<br /><br />P.S. I thought she changed her name to Esther.......her album is still under \\"Madonna\\"
0684824906|5.0|Note I did not say \\"feminist.\\"  Doris Kearns Goodwin has always seemed to be \\"one of the boys\\" among the small club of celebrity historians (McCullough, Caro, Ellis, Ambrose, etc.), but she is one of the few women to have penned a complete Lincoln biography, and her gentler, at times more emotional, perspective brings a new dimension to the genre.  We get insights into Lincoln's psyche and inner life that more traditional Lincoln biographers, like David Donald and Stephen Oates, spend little time on.  Here we see a Lincoln who wanted his name and memory to live on after his death (the true underlying theme of the book), and a man who literally would not have harmed a fly.  The author presents Lincoln as a \\"nice guy who finished first.\\" <br /> <br />Her admiring portrait of Seward is wonderful, as is her scolding treatment of Chase (Bates, among the \\"team of rivals,\\" is never quite fleshed out to the same degree). <br /> <br />The first 200-300 pages of the book are the strongest and most engrossing; once we get past the Emancipation Proclamation there's much less to mine that hasn't been dealt with before.  Still, it's a wonderful book and requird reading for any Lincoln buff.
B0000AUHPB|3.0|You said it, Mr McVarish! I was sitting here on Nov 19th thinking I'll watch TIJ, with Caine, again: it's a really silly, silly movie. I must be psychic. You stole my title. Anyway, this is a ludicrous, ridiculous film, made up of a lot of little disconnected sketches which don't really add up to a full-scale drawing. If there is a theme or a moral, it seems to be that whatever kind of car you drive, you'll be seeing it coming down the mountain, sooner or later. The camera just loved those spinning, crashing, blazing cars, and couldn't take its eye off them. Irene Handl was a natural genius; and I believe she was just like that in real life. Benny Hill was a bit wasted. Truly, nothing much made much sense in this story. Characters came and went, popped up improbably all over the place. Like Caine in the prison toilet, or Coward in Harley Street. And what about that Fred Emney? A genuine one-off character. Pythonesque, is what I say. But everything is redeemed by the magnificent, brilliant, unique and unrepeatable ending. I can't think of anything else to say, since I've run out of ideas.
0307276902|1.0|I read the whole book only because I kept waiting to get to the good part. There is no good part. I certainly never felt that I couldn't put it down. Day after day of descriptions of him vomiting chunks didn't do it for me as a reader.
B000AQJNOS|1.0|Purchase this dvd at your peril!   There was no indication that a Region 1 disc was to be issued, so i purchased this Pal Region 2 version in the UK.  What a disappointment!   I noted this was not issued by Fox who released the original movie.  The color transfer is absolutely awful, mainly pink, and shifting continuously - it looks like a product from some interim stage of the restoration process.   <br />I have just received a copy of the Region 1 Fox disc from Amazon, and it is superb, just as this fabulous movie should be.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|It has been ten years since I first knew Madonna. In fact, Something To Remember was the first record I have ever bought.I was 14 then and I saved my money for that. I fell in love with her ever since. I searched for all her previous albums after I had known their titles. During my school period, all my friends and classmates knew that I like Madonna. I was quite famous because of that. I sang You Must Love Me and knelt in front of them. I memorize the lyrics of her songs (130 songs excluding Freedom, OST Evita, and Confessions). I have 109 cds from Madonna (complete albums, most singles and some concert Dvds). I bought The Virgin Tour laser disc with only $10. There are 2 women I admire and respect most in this life, my mom and Madonna (they're both at the same age, it's strange). Some people say that Madonna is old already, they'd better look for other female artist. But to me, Madonna is Madonna. Ain't no one gonna replace her. I grow up listening everyday to her music and I don't even get a little bit bored. I've lost a sister, I've moved to different houses, I've changed my religion, I've overcome such bad times in my life. Still I listen to Madonna's music and she remains my choice. I must say that I should be glad that I'm still alive after all that I've gone through. And what I've got to say is: Madonna...I just can't stop loving you, I just can't stop loving you, and if I stop then tell me just what will I do. Cause my life ain't worth living if I can't be with you. I don't need to see presidents or politicians. I don't need to see so called wise men. I don't need to see succesfull or rich businessmen. What I want is to see Madonna.
B000AYNFWG|5.0|I won't get into the film itself. There are enough reviews of it here to have it agreed... La Dolce is a masterpiece of cinema that no collection of international films can live without.  <br /> <br />As for this boxed collection... it is simply superb. The production has been hailed as one of the best restorations of any classic film on DVD, and the bonus material is extremely extensive. The packaging is one-of-a-kind and will serve all show-and-tellers well, but what I love indeed is the inclusion of frame-able high-gloss photographs from the film, along with a re-issued poster and well crafted book (of some 40 pages). The photos are now framed in my study and friends comment on their beauty regularly. Interestingly, they are printed on a thick card stock as opposed to regular photo-paper. I commend the folks at Koch Lorber for thinking this through, allowing the pictures to be so very sturdy while maintaining their beauty.  <br /> <br />I received this box as a gift, and I plan on giving it as a gift this year to several people I know who will cherish it for years to come. Well worth the money.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|...but i love this album.  I only bought it because I was curious having heard Hung Up on the radio, and it's the best thing I've heard in ages.  I've got it on repeat on my iPod, and each time I hear it I find that a different track is standing out as my favourite.  For someone like me who has no strong preference for one type of music but loves dancing to anything that's groovy, it's just great.  It really is very very good fun and the more I hear it, the more impressed I am by it as a dance album - which I wasn't on first play, although maybe that's because I was concentrating on it too much...Fabulous.  It does just keep getting better...
B00005R24K|3.0|The lack of plot development kinda bored me but after a while I realised this movie is more about being a weird art project than telling a story. Like sometimes blood looks like blood, and then other times it looks like paint or water to create a different effect. It almost seemed like a lot of the make up could have just been made from stuff they found in the kitchen. In one scene someone's leg got clawed and their skin tore like it had the consistency of wet cardboard. I think weird experimental art-gore scenes like that were what the point of the movie was. The movie alternates between lulls where you're like \\"god this movie is so boring, why isn't there any plot, why do they expect me to even care about what's going to happen next\\", and the visual action sequences. I get that they needed something the break up the action sequences, but it felt like what they were using was most often just empty space, like they could have had an actual story develop between the art-horror scenes, but they just didn't bother. I think the movie's interesting, but not quite good. A bit of a mess, but still much better than Halloween or Friday The 13th.  <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Honestly, I wasn't expecting anything great from this album.  I've never been an avid madonna listener so the only songs i ever heard from her were the ones that were played beyond death on the radio.  This album is a nostalgic compilation of euro, funk, and techno and i enjoyed almost every song (which is usually rare on any album).   <br />Influences of awesome basslines resembling Nu are in songs such as Isaac and Let It Will Be <br />Trance/Euro feel is heard from Get Together and How High <br />Funk/Disco vibe is definitely in songs such as Hung up, Jump, and Future Lovers  <br /> <br />Yea..this CD has pretty much everything that can be played in a club and is a testament to why Madonna will never go down.  Make sure you have a subwoofer or you won't be doing this CD any justice.  It's the wheels to a car <br /> <br />Favorite songs:  <br />\\"Let It Will Be\\" - any techno song that can combine any classical instrument loop is usually golden. <br />\\"Isaac\\" - personal fan of middle-eastern influnces and although this song is probably sacreligious in some way or another, it's still beautiful and candy to the ears <br />\\"Jump\\" - Chorus is beyond uplifting and reminds me of old school euro songs (Alice Deejay, Origene, Becca) + has orchestra loop (heh heh)
0553801503|3.0|I am sure that many of you have read both Mr. Jordan's Wheel of Time series and Martin's Fire and Ice.  The three stars for Feast of Crows represent two things.  <br />1)  I gave the latest installment of the Wheel of Time, book 11, two stars.  Up one star from the crap that was book 10.  Feast of Crows gets three stars because George Martin has constantly written rings around Mr. Jordan, up to now.   <br />  <br />2)  Feast of Crows gets three stars because it is not anywhere near as good as the first three Fire and Ice books. <br /> <br />As a matter of fact, has anyone else noticed the unfortunate similarities that have developed? <br /> <br />Both series started off with three well written installments.  With the fourth or fifth installment of the Wheel of Time, the pace and action slowed to a crawl.  In Fire and Ice, we will be getting not one, but two books that cover the same time frame!!  Pacing can't much slower than that. <br /> <br />Wheel of Time started introducing 'mystery' characters about the same time as the pacing slowed down.  These were characters that left the reader scratching their head in confusion because there was no introduction to the character and no explanation to who or what these characters represent.  We now get the same in Fire and Ice. <br /> <br />Just like Wheel of Time, Feast of Crows suffers from an overload of characters.  Hundreds of named characters are in Fire and Ice.  Instead of making for a 'richer' fantasy world, this only makes the reader look up the character to remind themselves of who these people are.  It also takes pages away from the main characters while giving space to people and events we do not care about.   Why take the time to develop the great plot lines in the first three books, only to throw them away in book four?   <br /> <br />I hope I am wrong with this last comparison, but I don't think I am.  Wheel of Time became an obvious ploy to milk every last dollar from the fans of the series.  There is noother excuse or reason why a series will go on for 12 or 13 installment.  Now George Martin is already saying that he can't finish Fire and Ice in anything less than 7 books, up from the planned 5.  One gets the impression that Feast of Crows is just filler.  A book written with chapters cut out from the last book, a few new elements, and Poof... A new book designed from the outset to relieve the readers of 25 dollars, while the auther does as little work as possible.
B000A7Q2DM|1.0|I never write reviews on here, but I was angered into writing this one because I can not for the life of me understand how any past 30STM fan can even say this album holds a candle to their brilliant debut album. When I first listened to this album I was in utter disbelief and disgust that it was the same band. Jared's vocals have gone to hell. He screeches and screams just like an emo band lead vocalist. \\"A Modern Myth\\" ends with him continually whining by saying \\"goodbye\\" over and over again to where you just want to slap the girliness out of him and hope that he will sound amazing again one day. I have not been so disappointed in an album since Metallica's ST. ANGER album. Every song on their debut album was memorable, melodic, interesting and innovative. However any song on this album could have been released by My Chemical Romance or Hawthorne Heights. It was so bad that it immediately moved them out of my favorite bands list. If their next album is anything like this trash then I will be through with them. Such a disappointment. The only 2 songs I could even stomach are \\"Savior\\" and \\"From Yesterday\\". Everything else was just terrible high school screamo music. I listen mostly to mainstream bands (Flaw, Staind, Cold, Tool, Evanescence, Seether, Godsmack, Disturbed, Linkin Park, etc.) and even I couldn't handle this. Their first album was a flawless masterpiece compared to the junk on this release. Also the copy protected crap got on my nerves as well since I couldn't listen to it on my default cd player on my PC. I will never buy another album with that feature on it again.

0440178002|5.0|This epic tale of courage, war, betrayal, love, and beauty takes place in Japan during the beginning of its interaction with the European nations. Although it is historic fiction, the detail and thoroughness of the story make it seem as if it really happened. The basic story is of how a prejudiced English explorer sails to Japan. There, he finds a whole new world. He is taught Japanese life, language, and culture, and is used as a link to the outside world by the most powerful daimyo in Japan. He becomes a pawn in a war for the Shogunate, and is used, due to the fact that he is hated by all of the Jesuits that control the trade on the island, to turn the tide of the war. In this, he finds the love of his life, who happens to be married, and begins a passionate affair with her. Although it is a long read, it is worth every bit of the time spent on it.
B0002X314C|1.0|i am so sorry to say this, and i know a lot of u guys are gonna rate my review unhelpful, but i was REALLY dissapointed in this cd. i think i expected a lot more since kayne was constantly hyping him up. don't get me wrong, he does have a beautiful soothing voice, the i thought the content was a little weak. i think his lyrics is his biggest downfall. (sorry! just stating my opinion) i can tell by the reviews a lot of people don't agree with me. i bought this cd when it first came out for regular price, i originally bought it strictly for the track \\"ordinary people\\" then i took a listen to the rest of the cd, and i must say i was very disspointed. a few months later this same cd went on sale for $9.99 and i can't even say that i would pay that price.  for a good listen i think you should invest in anthony hamilton or dwele. thanks guys!!! don't hate me
B000BO0LLS|5.0|She became the most successful and best-selling artist of the decade in the 90's, according to Billboard magazine and the World Music Awards In 2000, the World Music Awards show named her the best-selling female recording artist of all time.  <br /> <br />Carey has sold \\"in excess of 105-times platinum in the U.S. alone, and 230 million worldwide, making her the top-selling female artist in history  <br /> <br />Carey's voice was voted as the greatest voice in music in MTV and Blender Magazine's countdown of \\"The 22 Greatest Voices In Music\\",  <br /> <br />The Emancipation of Mimi, which spawned her sixteenth number-one single, \\"We Belong Together\\".  <br /> <br />On the other hand the old Kabbalah hag who's first album was released in 1983. has only sold 200 million albums. In the past 22 years she has only had 12 no. ones  <br /> <br />Why has Mariah had more no 1's then Madonna, I tell you why because Mariah is far more talented then Madonna. Mariah current album proves this. <br /> <br />This information is from MTV AND VHONE, I have not made this information up you need to check your facts.  <br /> <br />Any way Mariah has only been around for 15 years, in comparison the Kabbalah hag who has  been around for 22 years. Even if you say that she has sold 250,000,000 units this is only 30,000,000 more then Mariah. If you work it out Madonna in those extra 7 years in the industry she has only managed to sell 30,000,000 units. Big deal also she about nearly twenty years older then Mariah. The Kabbalah hag reckons that her skin is all down to eating good and exercises, but we all know the truth its due to botox and plastic surgery. <br /> <br /> <br />Lets also talk about voice quality below is the list the Kabbalah hang is nowhere to be found.  <br /> <br />The coundown was not based simply on the artist's vocal prowess, claims Tom Calderone, music and talent vice president at MTV2 and MTV. \\"We considered how the voice complements the music and connects with listeners. It comes down to how compelling and influential that voice is to people's lives.\\"  <br />The 22 Greatest Voices in Music <br />1. Mariah Carey  <br />2. Freddie Mercury  <br />3. Whitney Houston  <br />4. Bono  <br />5. Christina Aguilera  <br />6. Alanis Morissette  <br />7. Kurt Cobain  <br />8. Bjrk  <br />9. Celine Dion  <br />10. Tupac Shakur  <br />11.

Blige  <br />20. Michael Stipe  <br />21. Sade  <br />22. Bruce Springsteen  <br />You also talk about how DJ overplay Mariah singles, but there is a reason for this its because the public demand it. Any way Mariah CD has been out since April its been in the top 50 albums since then. The album also the tied as the best selling album of 2005 going 4 times platinum. For the record Platinum is better the Gold. <br /> <br />Your poor reviews of her album are sad, they are not affecting peoples decision about whether or not to purchase her album. I have not given Kabbalahan hag a review for her album because I have not herd it, although her new single is catchy. So people buy the album and then review it. <br />
B00005JMEW|1.0|...Half way through is a long time to decide if a movie is too bad too watch, but it was so bad, I just didn't know if I was imagining things. This film is so violent, they had to put some of it in cartoon form! This was when I literally walked out of the cinema while people around me were p'ing themselves laughing of how ultra violent it all was! I don't know how anyone can enjoy a movie like this where it's just blood and guts everywhere! Tarrantino is one sick puppy!     If you like Tarrantino films, Pulp Fiction is much better which has all the well-known actors like John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Samuel L Jackson and so on. At least this movie is realistic which tells the lifes of several people who's stories of violence, gangs, rapes are all loosely connected up with each other... Whilist this movie is just about chopping people's heads off with swords which is violence for the sake of violence! I wish people would bring out films that realistically betrays gore as it may occur in real life. I don't see too many people decapitating people with swords! IT'S EXTREMELY RARE -- EVEN MORE RARE THAN A TERRORIST ATTACK! But that's not the point, Tarrantino has gone way too far making this film! You might need to see the psychiatrist after watching this film. Luckily I didn't watch it all the way through! Definetly not a film for conservative Christians!

6305268177|5.0|I am surprised of how good these guys are! They were around for 5 decades and brought out zillions of albums and toured so many times. And then this live concert came out!     I don't even know that much about them compared with other people but am just starting to get into them myself!    It has all their hits from the 1950's til their then-current album Still Waters. They do a duet with Celine Dion and it sounds heavenly to hear them sing together. I find it incredible the backing musicians can be with them for such a long time such as John Merchant and now even Andy Gibb (Barry's eldest son) plays with them at this concert.    There is a good vibe on this concert, the TV panel in the background is quite effective as it takes you down memory lane showing you their clips from various decades! The trio are all dressed in black, false setto or ordinary singing tone, they are hear in this vibrant concert still going strong after all these years! This 3 people deserve a gold medal for singing these songs so and keeping their fans and new generations of fans! Writings songs for such famous movies like Grease and Saturday Night Fever! They should be so proud of what they have acheived throughout their lifetime. Excellent song choice, great harmonies and good covers chosen!    Only one thing I didn't like is it's too hard to see Olivia Newton-John in the audience when they make a note about \\"Australian greats\\" -- they never focus the light on here properly enough, and when the little girl gives Barry the flower boquet, the poor little girl doesn't realize the song \\"Guilty\\" is about to start and Barry arrogantly tells her to \\"shoo!\\" while sweeping the flowers in front of her! Excuse me!    Oh well, I am not a picky reviewer and like to be as realistic as possible.    One other gripe I have is on the video edition, there was no song list! I find that rotten because I had to find the song list on Internet and then print it out and add a little sheet at the back of the videocase! We expect the companies that release music items to tell you what songs are on where and when -- just like a DVD telling you how many scences the movie has!    Apart from these unfortunate disappointments, it's worth watching them! The sound is absolutely perfect! I love the guitarist -- he has such good timing and delivery was brillant.     Brillant music! Talented musicians! Great show! Get it now! They are \\"veterans,\\" but far from dead!
B000B8QF14|1.0|Okay whatever, shut the hell up. <br />What a horrendous live album, more commercial crap from this so called \\"band\\". this is the death toll ringing for Green Days music and the beginning of more commercialised money making junk and scams. <br />Total sellouts.
B000002UUX|5.0|Literally never a dull moment on this album! It's all 100% thrash til the end. The best line up, the best selection of songs. Everything is perfect with this album. Only broken up by the very slow \\"Dawn Patrol,\\" near the end, which really suits it on the album. The video clips for these videos are great too. Hangar 18, Holy Wars... if you ever get a chance to see them, please do so! Unfortunately the Rusted Pieces video is out of print, fingers cross and try ebay!     You wonder why they didn't continue this album style and keep writing explosive Megadeth songs! If you want more of this sort of thing, check out other classic albums like So Far So Good So What! and Peace Sells! Which are classic albums in their own right, but this one tops them all!    Why did all the fun stop with this album?
0446577383|1.0|As with many writers today, Baldacci fails to finish as strongly as he develops and rolls out his story. It is a gripping tale up to the last 50, predictable pages. I am not sure what editors are doing these days, but Balducci is not served well by his.

B000AWYOGE|3.0|Hollywood version of 'Dark Water' tries to do something we all long for in great horror films, but seldom get in reality. That is, realistic character and realistic scare, and the film directed by Walter Salles almost succeeds in getting both of them.   <br /> <br />Probably you should not watch Salles' `Dark Water' as horror whatever your fefinition of horror might be. It does not show many deaths, and its mystery is almost non-existent. The story is not complicated. A mother and a daughter move into an apartment in Roosevelt Island, New York City, but in this small room a series of strange things start to happen, for example, a leak from the ceiling, or sound of someone walking, coming from the room above, where no one should be living.  <br /> <br />But the modernized ghost story has in its center the characters drawn by novelist/screenwriter Rafael Yglesias (`Fearless'), whose interest does not seem to lie in telling a traditional horror story. Instead, Jennifer Connelly plays the loving mother Dahlia, who is in the middle of custody battle over the daughter Cecillia. Not being able to afford an expensive place, she rents an old apartment room to live with her lovely daughter, but what she is really afraid of is not the dark corridor or dirty basement of the building, but that one day she might lose her daughter. In that case the smooth-talking landlord (John C. Reilly) or grim old super (Pete Postlethwaite) do not help. Or, perhaps, Tim Roth's lawyer who uses his car as office. <br /> <br />You see, `Dark Water' is a curious mixture of classic-type horror and classic-type drama. If Dahlia is driven to nervous breakdown, it might be because of the acrimonious fight against husband (Dougray Scott), or because of her own fear that her daughter might be going away from her, or maybe Dahlia's own past that is suggested in the opening. The emotion of some scenes is, some say, more suitable for much more `serious' dramas.  <br /> <br />Though they are fairly interesting, these aspects of the script about divorce court only weaken the supernatural part of the film, for which it was originally made. We surely see the dropping water from the ceiling, and the black stain that grows bigger and bigger everyday, but that only makes us think that they need a good plumber and less irresponsible super. Yes, the production designs of the building are superb, always creepy enough, but when we are greatly impressed with these spooky images, we forget anything about the not-so-rare story about the husband who left, or the custody fight.  <br /> <br />It was only three years ago that I watched the original 'Dark Water' (or 'Honogurai Mizuno Soko Kara') in Kyoto's old Toho-theatre, and as far as I can remember, the film didn't show much about the mother's past because it does not have to. Well-crafted as it is, this original film was not a big hit in Japan in spite of its director Hideo Nakata and the original writer Koji Suzuki, the same team who gave us the chilling 'Ringu.' I still don't know why it failed to attract many people, but whatever it is, Hollywood decided on adding materials to the Japanese version. It is laudable that they gave it an intelligent, psychological elements, but if you want a horror to be really scary, and supernatural story more fascinating, intelligence and psychology (and lawyer and custody) may not be necessarily the best choice to do so.
B0007GAEW6|2.0|I wasn't expecting TMV to top \\"De-Loused...\\" since, in my opinion, that album is pure genius. But even with my realistic expectations, I was definitely dissapointed with \\"Frances...\\". Whether or not anyone wants to admit it...\\"Deloused...\\" has \\"hooks\\" in their songs. Combining that fact with their incredible skills(especially the drummer, damn he's good!) and creativity, it made for a mind-blowing album. \\"Frances...\\" has no hooks. It's completely boring. Not to mention there is way too much filler such as bird sounds that seem to last forever. I can't help but think that this is a result of not having someone like Rick Rubin(producer of De-loused) there to tighten the reigns and give some valuable input into their song writing.  <br />Plain and simple...I just can't get into any of these songs no matter how many times I listen to it. \\"De-loused...\\" is a masterpiece and I can only hope that TMV get's back on track to writing quality material again.
B00003CXCT|4.0|If this trilogy were only to be judged on the original breakthroughs it made in science fiction film, especially space film, and its appeal to children, it would be a solid, yet only average trilogy.     What allows Star Wars to rise a bit ahead of the pack is the multidimensional and believable human story that underlies the grand saga. Luke's story is a touching coming of age tale, and despite the many differences between his world and ours we identify with his desire for adventure, his youthful awe of ancient wisdom, and his struggle to expand his spiritual self. Unlike many science fiction worlds this one struggles with a theme familiar to ourselves: the survival of religion and faith in a world of science. In a way it is also a period piece of contemporary America, if one sees the Soviet Union as the \\"evil empire\\". Finally, the relevations and unfolding of the plot are truly shocking and will keep this trilogy alive in the popular consciousness for decades to come. The only flaw comes in the final installment, Return of the Jedi, which foreshadows some of Hollywood's later reliance on overwhelming battle scenes as a replacement for storytelling magic.     Overall though, still a solid legacy and to this day it's a bit underrated.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|Although this film is not based on real events the spine-chilling actor's play makes you to believe. <br />This film gives a lot of questions about existence of GOOD end EVIL as material beings. <br />I think it will be very interesting if for agnostics to see this film.  <br />This film does not show that evil exists; it just shows you that there is a little probability of its existence. <br />
B0001HLVS2|2.0|At one moment, this movie seems to be about a ship of war attempting to complete a mission. At another moment, it seems to be an \\"expose\\" of life on an 18th century vessel. At yet another moment, it seems to be a pretentious moral investigation into the balance of military vs. scientific priorities. Unfortunately, from trying to be so many things it never succeeds in fulfilling any one of them. Nor do the characters give us particularly much to care about them. The end result is a definitely underwhelming impact leaving one wondering why this film was made in the first place.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|the queen of pop is back to reclaim her rightful place. this album is infinitely better than the disgrace called \\"american life\\" and gives \\"ray of light\\" and \\"music\\" a run for there money. every song hits the spot. the only bad thing that could be said is \\"WHAT TOOK HER SO LONG\\"!?
B00005JNBQ|2.0|This movie is about a guy with no personality who constantly speaks in this extremely annoying sarcastic accent whenever spoken to, and at the end of the movie is does a crazy dance which somehow is meant to accomplish something significant, but is actually depressingly pathetic...which pretty much sums up this movie. I won't give it away unless you actually want to see it. But frankly, it wouldn't make much difference. Oh, high school angst, oh rural life, oh, making fund of stupid losers on film. All of these themes have been 'done' and done far better than this. Worst of all this film is clearly self-conscious and pretentious. It thinks that just because it is an 'indie' film somehow everything it does is clever: WRONG. Unfortunately, like the Emperor with no clothes it has taken quite a few people along for the ride, silently mocking them even as they enjoy their feelings of superiority over the characters in the movie. If you want to see a self-congratulating film that thinks it had achieved some kind of aesthetic epiphany, but actually just rehashes all the old formulas and cliches from '80s teen flicks, go ahead and see this.

0060974176|2.0|This is a fairly poorly researched book, despite the authors' credentials; their history of American automobiles is grossly inaccurate and only serves to reinforce incorrect stereotypes.

The misreading of the Volvo story is also rather galling, though to be fair, Volvo's team-based approach was already being dismantled (for non- <br /> by the time this book was written.

B0006399FS|5.0|I bought this CD the day it came out.  I had loved \\"Vertigo\\" and expected the rest of the CD to be like it.  At first I was disappointed because of that, but after listening to it, I really loved it!!!  I have been the biggest U2 fan since 1982 and have all their CDs.  I believe this may now be my favorite. <br />It is U2 returning to their roots in a refreshing and mature manner. Most importantly they have continued to create beautiful and original music as only they can. <br />I can't really pick a favorite, but love \\"City of Blinding Lights\\", \\"Love and Peace or Else\\", \\"All Because of You\\", \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\" and \\"Original of the Species\\". <br />After just having floor seats to this concert, I can tell you HTDAAB is just as good live as it is on CD.  I can't wait till their next album.
B000002H6C|4.0|The first time i heard metallica, i heard frantic. I wasnt much of a metal fan back then so it didnt blow me away. Then i got into it, and i got master of puppets and ride the lighning. Now i am into metal, and this is probably the metallica album i listen to the most. It is just the album that appeals to me the most, and i find it oddly catchy. It has good solid guitar work, the drumming is good, there are good solos, and the vocals aren't drowned out or too dominating. I also find it good music when i'm working, and i can just play it in the background, and that's not an insult. But i find that i didnt enjoy anything after this album by this band. Maybe \\"fuel\\" ocasionally or \\"shoot me again\\" but i beleave this is a great effort, and a killer album, and the last of the band's kind. <br />So if you like metallica and you like metal, don't miss this.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|A mind blowing trip that kept my head spinning starting with \\"Hung Up\\" all the way to the last song \\"Like It Or Not\\"! Images kept flashing through my brain while I took a 90 minute trip from the mall where I bought this cd all the way home. The way the songs blend into one another was awesome. Each song impressed me more than the one before. The beat of the songs are easily digestible without sacrificing the intelligent lyrics. You can dance to these songs and meditate on what Madonna is singing about at the same time. The hell with the critics who don't like Madonna. I have over 300 cd's in my music collection and this release is one of the best recordings I've ever heard. To me it is a Dance Classic ,already! THANK YOU, Madonna!
B000002U82|5.0|DSOTM is a tricky album. It is absolutely necessary that you listen to it more than once to fully appreciate it, especially if you are younger.  When I first heard it, I thought it was a little boring and slow, because I was used to the fast pace of rock today. But when you take time to just listen and to really hear the lyrics, this is a fantastic album. <br /> <br />It never ceases to amaze me that Dark Side of the Moon can pack such a powerful punch that you are surprised how quickly the album goes by. <br /> <br />My favorite song on the CD is either Speak to Me/Breathe or Brain Damage.   <br /> <br />The CD wraps up perfectly in Eclipse with the line \\"And everything under the sun is in tune, but the sun is eclipsed by the moon.\\" <br /> <br />Perfection. <br />
0553801503|4.0|First and foremost - this is not one of those series that you can read out of order. Start with the first book. <br /> <br />That being said, many seem disappointed by this book - well, half-book. This is actually half of what Martin intended for the complete novel. While I might have made the divide differently - Sam's viewpoints seem out of place in my opinion - I was not disappointed. I also cannot agree that the plot is not advancing; the end of the book, especially, furthers the plot. Characters are on trial that I would never have expected. <br /> <br />There are some drawbacks to the novel - innumerable unanswered questions, for one. Still, if you were a fan of the first three novels, there is much to enjoy. <br /> <br />Overall, I was only completely disappointed with one thing: The fact that it was over too quickly. Ah well, here's to another year of waiting!

B00005JO1P|4.0|\\"Walk the Line\\" as James Mangold directs it is not the movie I would have made.  I would have begun at Folsom Prison, and would have carried the movie from there deep into the 1970s, through and beyond Cash's network TV show.  Much of what the rest of the movie covered -- the years between Cash's first record in 1955, and his marriage to June Carter in 1968 -- I would have condensed and inserted as flashbacks during the post-Folsom action. <br /> <br />Then again, that's why they didn't come to me to make the movie. <br /> <br />This film had to introduce Johnny Cash to a 2500-screen audience that hadn't heard all that many records, or read either of his autobiographies.  Thus, the long simmering love story between Carter and Cash takes center stage, with all of the usual beats of a celebrity biopic: the meet cute, the stormy courtship, the offbeat marriage proposal.  All of this material is competently handled and exactly what you would expect. <br /> <br />Joaquin Phoenix has been rightly praised for his performance.  He reportedly spent hundreds of hours learning the guitar and mastering That Voice, and every second of that preparation shows.  No celebrity biopic is going to stand if the actor is not up to par, and I cannot envision someone doing a better job than Phoenix of portraying Johnny Cash from ages 18 through 36. <br /> <br />The real relevation for me, though, was Reese Witherspoon.  The movie takes it first real breath of air when she collides into Phoenix backstage at an early Cash concert in Texas.  Her singing voice is also marvelous.  Witherspoon and Phoenix sing the Carter/Cash duet \\"Jackson\\" twice in the movie, and nail it both times. <br /> <br />At those moments when Phoneix and Witherspoon are onstage together, and demonstrating their remarkable craft, this movie transcends the typical off-the-rack movie biography, and becomes something truly magical.

B0000AK7AC|5.0|Brilliant film-making comes in many guises, and \\"Babe\\" clearly and abundantly falls within this rarified realm.  With a compelling, fanciful storyline, peerless acting and seamless animation/real-life imagery, and the quiet assurance of James Cromwell's Academy award nominated portrayal of the taciturn, yet soulful Farmer Hoggett, this movie consistent manages to appeal to the viewer's heart, mind, funny bone and soul.  From the uproarious (a wacky goose who faces possible slaughter for a Yuletide meal proclaiming \\"Christmas is carnage...Christmas is CARNAGE!\\") to gentle, real love between a man and his pig (not that kind of love, you perverts!), as Farmer Hoggett gently admonishes his porcine sheepdog, \\"That'll do, pig.  That'll do\\", as they take the grand prize at the Sheep Hearding contest at the film's heart-wrentching conclusion, this movie belongs in the pantheon of great and original films.<br /><br />[As to the reviewer here who decried the film as \\"cruel\\", I feel compelled to reply that the only cruelty was your failure to let your children see the movie through to its beautiful conclusion.  Death is a part of life -- heck, Walt Disney whacked Bambi's mom in what many consider the definitive children's movie -- and this film deals with death responsibly and gently.  Likewise, and to the best of my recollection, none of the central characters meets its demise, though I would concede that perhaps the implied death (very off screen) of Babe's mother may be upsetting to children under the age of 5 or 6.]

0525948023|5.0|Eckhart Tolle does an excellent job in this book of pointing the reader toward the path of achieving greater inner peace. In an extension of \\"The Power of Now\\", Tolle delves further into what it means to see beyond the cluttered, disjointed world of abstract thoughts and memories that we've come to identify as \\"ourselves\\" (my little story as he likes to call it).  In going beyond this mental scrapbook of memories we begin to see that we are more than our physical bodies and the story of what's happened to us. We are not our roles (mother, brother, doctor, runner, etc.) and we are not an illness or condition.  Without these identity props we begin to sense our deeper selves as the timeless nameless backdrop of awareness. We are able to relax more and let the present moment just be.    While this may sound simple, the ramifications are profound. According to Tolle, life takes on a deeper dimension. Gradually the day-to-day conflicts, human drama, and mental noise appears more superficial and self created. The present moment takes on a warmer, inviting sense -- one that's not at odds with life. The constant need to live in the past, or hope for the future, diminishes and a new appreciation for the present begins to appear.      My son had a wonderul teacher that helped turned his life around.  She was diagnosed with terminal cancer and one day my wife saw her standing in the school courtyard with her face skyward, feeling the rain drops as they fell. No one was around, she simply stood there feeling each precious drop of rain.  I think that's the kind of presence that Tolle describes.     \\"When you make the present moment, instead of the past and future, the focal point of your life, your ability to enjoy what you do -- and with it the quality of your life -- increases dramatically.\\" (pg. 297)    Enjoy!

1400032717|5.0|Seeing life through Christopher's eyes is mesmerizing.  This is a powerful book that I finished in one reading at 2:20 AM.  The mentally impaired, be it schizophrenia, autism, or whatever, deserve our empathy. <br /> <br />Christopher has trouble forming and maintaining relationships.  This does not bother him because he enjoys life immensely in other ways.  He has high-functioning autism, excels at math, and sees details in daily life that would put TV's \\"Monk\\" to shame.  His best relationship is with his counsellor.  Other intermittently good relationships are with his parents, but Christopher's role is, unfortunately, all take and no give -  it's all he can do given his inherited condition. <br /> <br />There are several plot lines, but this author only uses them as tools to expose Christopher's unusual and socially disastrous thought patterns.  He seamlessly brings these various themes together for a successful ending.  This book is a masterpiece that you will long remember.  It is well worth moving to the front of your \\"to be read\\" list.

0312330529|5.0|I've read several thousand books. My father was an English teacher and from a young age I've been in love with the lives and lessons etched with the sole on the pages of novels. I've never written a review for a book here on amazon or anywhere else. Until now I've never felt so moved by a novel. Gregory David Roberts delivers a griping story of life and love, loss and hope with the most beautiful writing I've ever read. This is a modern classic. This author offers sanctuary during the generation of death for great literature. This is a book that I will add to the very few that I read again every several years. This author will be added to an even shorter list of best friends I will never meet. Thank you, Mr. Roberts, for this gift of a book.

B000BEZQ18|5.0|Teddy Thompson virtually owns the Brokeback Mountain soundtrack with his 2 appearances! His \\"I Don't Want to Say Goodbye,\\" with a Bernie Taupin lyric, is wonderful. While the duet with Rufus Wainwright is musically clever, RW proves a weaker, dare I say queenier, partner nearly left in the proverbial dust. Even on his solo, \\"The Maker Makes,\\" which he wrote, RW doesn't come off as honest with lines like \\"get along, little doggies.\\" The legendary status of both Emmylou Harris [also singing a Taupin lyric] & Willie Nelson [on a Dylan song] are as you'd expect, which ain't at all slackin', still, the relative obscurity of Teddy makes his vocals the greater gift. If his next album has half the power of his performances on this soundtrack, he darn well better have a success.  <br /> <br />Steve Earle's new recording of \\"The Devil's Right Hand,\\" right along with The Gas Band's [the composer's initials?] \\"An Angel Went Up in Flames,\\" which sounds suspiciously like a classic Charlie Daniels tune, & \\"I Will Never Let You Go\\" by Jackie Greene pull the tempo up. Fish out of water Linda Ronstadt is just over 2 minutes, and we all know it well, but the soundtrack wouldn't have suffered from her absence. Here's hoping it plays a more pivotal role in the film.  <br /> <br />The incidental music is virtually as compelling, although it remains to be \\"seen\\" how it plays in the theatres. I trust the filmmaker wouldn't have allowed the film to be cheapened by less than evocative. The plaintive, pluck & slide guitar with just the right touch of orchestral strings is enough to cause one to swoon.  <br />
B0009HLDFU|3.0|I was completely furious that I couldn't play this cd on my computer when it first arrived.  I didn't want to copy it, I didn't want to load it into an iPod, I just wanted to PLAY the stupid thing in the computer in my exercise room.  It took me at least an hour to figure out how to uninstall and bypass the software just to get it to play properly.  I will never buy music from Sony again - not even from iTunes.  I love me some Foo, but I want to be able to listen to the music I paid for without becoming infuriated.  I'm starting to long for the old days of cassette tapes....
B000BJS4OY|5.0|This is more than I could have ever hoped for. This set is truly a gift for all springsteen fans.
B000AGTPUA|5.0|This movie is not your run-of-the-mill hammered out in record time X-mas movie for ABC Family that has absolutely no script and no emotion.  This movie is in line with the classic X-mas movies of old (Miracle on 34th Street, It's a Wonderful Life) and also in line with those great Rankin-Bass X-mas specials of the 1960s & 1970s (Rudolph, Frosty, and so on.)  I'm a stickler when it comes to X-mas movies, and this movie is amazing.  Not only am I a X-mas nut, I'm a train nut as well.  Both sides of me enjoyed this movie enormously.<br /><br />The look of this movie is spectacular, the digital anamation is the ONLY way this movie could have been done to capture the look and feel of the book.  Live action would not have been right, and regular cell animation would not be right either.  This was literally the movie jumping right out of the book.<br /><br />The songs are great.  The train is great.  Tom Hanks is great.<br /><br />You truly must be Scrooge (pre-ghost Scrooge that is) if you watch this movie and don't shed a tear of joy and end up with an incredible warm feeling afterwards.  It takes a lot for me to open up to a new X-mas movie, and this one fits the bill nicely.  It's already one of my favorite X-mas movies of all time now.<br /><br />HIGHLY recommended!
0670033693|5.0|I just read this book and loved it. I have never been to Absaroka County, but after reading this book I feel like my first visit there would seem like a return trip, and a welcome one.  Sheriff Longmire is a beautifully drawn character.  He is a strong yet flawed man, who, now widowed, is just trying to do his job, stay connected to his daughter, and have a few drinks and good conversation with his best friend, when a murder forces him to revisit an old case that has never quite left his mind.  His search to find the murderer is a compelling story that both unravels a mystery and reflects Longmire's inner struggles as he seeks to regain control of his life and maybe find a little justice along the way. The book has something for everyone: whether you love mysteries or generally steer clear of them; live in Wyoming or have never set foot west of the Mississippi; crave character development or merely want to be entertained.  I highly recommend it.  <br />
B000B8QEZG|4.0|This disc jumps right out at you with dizzying, spellbinding and trancelike tracks with infectious hooks. The music never stops  between songs, but segues seamlessly into the next song. This is serious pulsating dance music with flawless production that sounds retro and futuristic all at once. I Love New York is a standout track, featuring a heavy churning groove and ripping guitar as it takes you into the chorus. This rock music fan has found this disc to be a pleasant surprise.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I was excited about getting this album, but after seeing the complaints from people about how they can't rip the CD to a computer I want nothing to do with it. What happened to the spirit of Rock & Roll? How can a band sell out and cheat their listeners. <br /> <br />I don't pirate music. I buy CDs, rip them to my computer and listen to them when I work. I don't want the inconveinance of having to find the CD and putting it in the CD drive. Does that sound lazy? Well, my time is too important and there is other great music out there where I don't have to deal with that. <br /> <br />I could rant more but you get the idea.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|It seems strange to me that all these little posers can say that A7X sold out.  So M. Shadows blew a vocal cord and can't scream.  I think it is a breath of fresh air in a music scene so oversaturated with guys who scream and think that makes them heavy.  The beauty of this album lies in the fact that the band doesn't have to scream and appeal to the little 14 year old wannabes who will only listen to a band because they scream or because they fit into this little preconception of what is rebellious or heavy.  M. Shadows' voice on this album does indeed come across as a little too much.  It seems affected, but overall does not diminish the quality of the record as a whole.  One song that I believe shines above and beyond any of A7X's pre-City of Evil material is Sidewinder.  The vocal delivery fits the song, and in my humble opinion a scream would not do this song justice.  The end of the song sees a foreign element in A7X's music as the song acquires a latin feel.  This alone would cause many \\"metalheads\\" to discount the album, saying that A7X has gone soft.  However, I find that this acoustic piece stands as one of the heaviest moments on the entire album.  The vocal melody is absolutely captivating and the guitar draws the listener in yet further.  The Left acoustic Solo, it stands to note, is played by Brian Haner, Synyster Gates' father.   <br />Most of thee other tracks are also excellent, with Seize The Day being another standout slow tempo piece.  The solo is amazing, as is the rhythm behind it.  Too many times listeners skip over the importance of the rhythm guitar behind a piece, but in reality the rhythm can make or break the solo. <br />My Third favorite track on the album is Beast and the Harlot.  What an amazing piece of music.  As epic as it is heavy, and that says a lot.  Great rhythm, great lead lines, insane soloing, it has it all.  By far my favorite of the fast, conventionally \\"heavy\\" tracks on the album.   <br />Overall, the musicianship on thisalbum is amazing, with the solos far outmatching the previous albums.  Anyone who is a fan of aggressive, technical music should definitely lend an ear to Avenged Sevenfold.  Not every track is for everyone, but more than likely each listener will be able to find something they like about this stellar album.
B000026FOA|5.0|In my opinion, \\"Five Leaves Left\\" was Nick Drake's best effort as far as attaining a balance between the arrangements of his songs in the studio and his guitar playing. Whereas his songs on \\"Bryter Layter\\" were suffocated by overproduction and orchestration and \\"Pink Moon\\" was notoriously underproduced, \\"Five Leaves Left\\" has just the right balance between accompaniment and his great guitar work. Songs like \\"Three Hours\\" have percussion that doesn't interfere with or bury Nick's guitar in the mix, allowing the listener to check out his amazing fingerpicking technique. The songs are really strong too, songs like \\"Saturday Sun\\" (an example of Nick Drake's rarely heard piano playing) have such great melodies that they stick with you. This album also includes the eerily prophetic \\"Fruit Tree\\", which could serve as a fitting epitaph for Nick Drake himself. In it he sings about being out of step with the times he was in and eventually achieving fame and appreciation after death, which is exactly what happened to him. The haunting last line, \\"They'll stop and stare when you're gone...\\" is chilling. The title of the album refers to a saying on the box of the brand of cigarettes Nick smoked, but it has also been noted that Nick died five years after the release of this album in 1969. Like the song \\"Fruit Tree\\", this coincidence makes you wonder. It's amazing that Nick Drake was 21 years old when this album was recorded and he already displayed such talent on the guitar. It's also amazing that he wrote these songs at such a young age. I would recommend this album to anyone regardless of what their musical tastes are. There is something about Nick Drake's music that stays with you long after you hear it.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Godsmack have become household names in the rock world, thanks to two multi-million selling albums that put Godsmack on the map. After the double platinum AWAKE, where was Godsmack to turn? Nowhere, except up. FACELESS is a pummeling assault on the ears, the most metal album they have done, maybe even more so than their self-titled album (another version of ALL WOUND UP). Here, with new drummer Shannon Larkin, Godsmack turn up the volume and the crunch is even more prominent, with Tony Rambola's vicious, teething guitar a back drop for Sully's anguished, punishing vocals...even Robbie on bass provides a nice thick bottom to compliment Shannon's nifty drumwork. <br /> <br />\\"Straight Out Of Line\\" was meant for radio, but more so it's a blistering assault on the ears. Likewise, \\"Re-Align\\" and the fierce and nasty \\"I F***ing Hate You\\" are both venomous yet catchy and downright crunchy. The title track is also a rollicking affair, and the inclusion of the classic \\"I Stand Alone\\" keeps the album's intensity genuine. But most surprising is the similarity of ending the album with the swirling, brooding \\"Serenity\\" which certainly lives up to its name with its dreamy acoustic guitars and congas. It seems like a cousin to \\"Voodoo\\", but \\"Serenity\\" has its own voice...a very soothing one at that. Make no mistake, though...most of FACELESS is meant to please the headbangers and metal fans who like the harder side of Godsmack. It certainly does possess the best assets of Godsmack...fierce, crunchy alterna-metal that will seep into your brain upon hearing it first listen. <br /> <br />FACELESS represents the brutal beauty of Godsmack, their scars beared for all to see. Containing some of the most heavy songs written, and even two atmospheric tracks that compliment the end of the album nicely, FACELESS is another solid affair from the Boston area boys.
B000024D4R|5.0|To me, Pink Floyd's 10th album, \\"ANIMALS\\", however UNJUSTLY under-rated, is the SECOND MOST ULTIMATE Pink Floyd journey you will ever experience, second ONLY to \\"Dark Side\\", and is therefore my second MOST FAVORITE Pink Floyd album. In my opinion, this album is even a little better than \\"Wish You Were Here\\" if you can imagine such a thing. Keep in mind all the songs on here are long masterpieces that didn't get any radio play due to their length, thus making it one of the most \\"unheard\\" album (radio-wise). But make no mistake- in this case, no radio-hits equals PURE MASTERPIECE!!! This is also one of Pink Floyd's most unusual album, because not much else that they've done really sounds quite like this. EXTREMELY UNIQUE sound, while being quite possibly the Floyd's ANGRIEST album. You can really hear Roger Waters's frustration with his society at the time, and though you may think it might be a distraction, it proves to be the backbone and underlying POWER of \\"ANIMALS\\". Dominated mainly by Roger Waters, the three main songs, DOGS, PIGS, and SHEEP, are basically his take on the human race and stand as categories that we all fall into, in his opinion. EXCELLENT CONCEPT backed by SOME of master guitarist David Gilmour's MOST IMPRESSIVE PLAYING to date! As usual, Mason and Wright contribute beautifully to the album. \\"ANIMALS\\" is actually considered by many die-hard PF loyalists as the most \\"CLASSIC\\" sounding Pink Floyd and I totally agree. It's truly a \\"hidden\\" gem that packs a punch like NO OTHER once you discover it's UNBELIEVABLE POWER AND ALL IN ALL IMPACT. The three masterful pieces are sandwiched between the beginning and end, PIGS ON THE WING 1 and 2. They are short little \\"book-ends\\" that perfectly start and end the PERFECT MASTERPIECE within. I even LOVE the album cover- an inflatable pig floating between two smoke stacks of an old power station in London. So simple, yet so beautiful it looks like a painting. Believe it or not, it's an actual photograph. \\"ANIMALS\\" just MAY prove to be your MOST TREASURED PINK FLOYD MASTERPIECES OF ALL, besides ofcourse, \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\". Prepare for a journey you'll NEVER, EVER forget! HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
B00006690G|5.0|I have always kind of liked Eminem, but now that I really pay attention to his songs, I realize that he isn't just singing for the heck of it, he is getting his message out to us.  This and Curtain Call are two that I definately need to own.
B000006TRV|5.0|Pink Floyd's \\"THE WALL\\", the legendary groups 11th album, stands as the groups most ambitious and interesting album, and ranks as probably my third most favorite PF album. However, many fans are torn with this incredible piece of work- you either hate it or love it. Few fall between. That's probably because as Floyd standards go, it's got a lot of \\"short\\" songs and a couple too many filler tracks, all of which were mainly created from a burned out Roger Waters who was fed up with himself, the music world, and being a rock star. But here's the interesting thing- the album grows on you with each listen and the stand-out tracks (which stand as some of Pink Floyd's BEST music EVER) help smooth out the filler, and the album as a whole becomes a VERY exciting and rewarding listening experience. Though dominated by Waters, you still get the whole band playing some of the most amazing music you'll ever hear. And as usual, you get David Gilmour's legendary guitar playing that you come to respect and love. This was probably the first of Pink Floyd's MANY masterpieces that I've heard, and right after I heard it I was astonished- it was my new favorite album at the time, and I couldn't imagine them putting out anything better. Then I tried their other albums and couldn't believe my ears! They are ALL good!! Even so, the AMAZING \\"THE WALL\\" still holds as one of my personal favorites. Epic masterpieces like ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL PT. 2, MOTHER, YOUNG LUST, HEY YOU, COMFORTABLY NUMB, and RUN LIKE HELL are the stand-outs, but after a few listens it seems like the ENTIRE album is a stand-out! VERY addictive and one of Pink Floyd's most impressive albums, and one Roger considers his \\"baby\\", having made a movie based on the entire album's concept, and following up with it's \\"LIVE\\" performance, one of the MOST extensive concert shows in his career. Whether hated or loved, \\"The WALL\\" stands as one of Pink Floyd's most recognized albums, along with \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\". So you owe it to yourself to atleast give it a shot- because IF you're one of the fortunate listeners who actually \\"gets it\\", it will easily become one of your favorites and will prove to be ONE of the most INCREDIBLE Pink Floyd listening experiences of all. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
1400032717|3.0|<br />For the most part, I enjoyed this clever book by first-time author Mark Haddon.  However, the jarring and unnecessary use of some extremely foul language- not to mention sexual situations inappropriate for the young main character- spoiled the book to some degree for me.  Perhaps it was thought that obscene words and deeds would automatically make the book a true adult title.  This is a practice that seems common (unfortunately,) even though it's a cheap, lazy way to acheive \\"realism\\".  Haddon's book would have been much better off without the spoiling language and descriptions, but the book is well-written otherwise so it gets a middle-of-the-road rating.
B0009HLDFU|2.0|I'd give In Your Honor 4 stars just for the 1st disc alone if it wasn't for Sony's damaging rootkit installation on my home and work PC's. I ran the CD and it's hidden software installation long before the story broke. Maybe I can prevent others from making the same mistake. <br />Note: This in no way reflects upon the Foo Fighters' excellent music. <br /> <br />Here's the detailed information that previous reviews left out: <br />Sony BMG Music Entertainment distributed a copy-protection scheme with music CDs, INLUDING THIS ONE, that secretly installs a \\"rootkit\\" on computers. This software tool is run without your knowledge or consent if it's loaded on your computer with a CD, a hacker can gain and maintain access to your system and you wouldn't know it. No current spyware detection applications will find nor remove it. <br /> <br />What is a \\"rootkit\\"? <br />A rootkit is a set of software tools frequently used by a third party (usually an intruder) after gaining access to a computer system. These tools are intended to conceal running processes, files or system data, which helps an intruder maintain access to a system without the user's knowledge. Rootkits are known to exist for a variety of operating systems such as Linux, Solaris and versions of Microsoft Windows. <br /> <br />The Sony code modifies Windows so you can't tell it's there, a process called \\"cloaking\\" in the hacker world. It acts as spyware, surreptitiously sending information about you to Sony, and it can't be removed. Trying to get rid of it damages Windows. What makes Sony's CD digital media software particularly nasty is that using expert tools for removing the parasite risks leaving you with a Windows PC that's useless, and that requires a full reformat and reinstall. Thanks, Sony! <br />
B00005JNQA|1.0|My goodness what a thoroughly disgusting surprise ... I should have know better based on the Amazon price of this DVD used .... <br /> <br /> <br />Ok so lets see first what's good about this movie ..... it was cheap .. <br /> <br /> <br />OK now whats bad ... The most aggravating thing was that when Penn wasn't mumbling and we had to turn the volume up to try to follow the movie, Kidman raced through her dialogue giving the impression she really didn't believe it either and just wanted to get back to her trailer. She appeared a little bigger in this film than in the Eyes Wide Shut film .... implants ... HMMM  <br /> <br /> <br />The writing in this movie is disjointed ... confusing ... seemed like it's out of sequence ... We never really do understand the Kidman character .. is she a sweet innocent, NO is she a freedom fighter, NO is she a loyal UN employee No ... what in the world was she supposed to be .... she turns out to be just a prickly porcupine type character ....  <br /> <br /> <br />I actually didn't want this DVD after seeing Sean Penn play patty cake with Saddam Hussein so I DID TRY to separate the actor from the person here... now I have decided I don't like him as a person or an actor now ..  <br /> <br /> <br />What a disappointment for a movie that I was truly looking foreward to seeing ..... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0743518144|4.0|I like this book because the authors based it on a scientific study of gallup poll questionaires of great managers. They spotted patterns in them. All of these managers honed their strengths and worked around their weaknesses. This book is a no BS analysis of what you need to do to excel. And it doesn't include focusing on your negatives. Instead, make your talents into strengths!
B000A6T1HC|5.0|Santa Cecilia is the patron saint of music, and Cecilia Bartoli is on her way to become the patron saint of forgotten Baroque music. I tried to be impartial about this album, as there were few vocal Cecialinisms on display that rubbed me the wrong way, but the religious zeal displayed by cara Cecila in preaching the Apocryphal Gospel of the Holy Baroque is just too much to handel.<br />Who else on the current vocal scene, male or female, has the technique to sing Farinelli's Son Qual Nave in concert, and then face the challenge of other extreme arias written for the castrato superstars in the days when opera was so hot, it was banned by the Pope, and composers turned to opera's younger cousin, the oratorio?<br />Cecilia also chooses to eschew the balmy evenings in Rome, sitting under canopy and sipping wine, and instead she's spending time in dark and possibly very musty libraries, rummaging through manuscripts. Caldara and other obscurities- can't she just go over to some music store and pick up a copy of \\"Handel's Pleasing and Pretty Arias for Everybody\\"?<br />Yes, there are mannerisms and crazy technique, and when all this is coupled with Cecilia's hyperkinetic energy, the result is often an aural equivalent of mad, cackling hen coming at you at 200 mph. Having just seen her live, I also have a hard time listening to Che dolce simpatia without seeing Cecilia bouncing up and down, like some pastoral bird that had little too much honey. Ciofi or Genaux could do these arias, possibly with a lot more polish and subtlety. But then it's Cecilia that makes it all is so damn exciting.<br />Minkovsky and his period-instrument Louvre orchestra are providing admirable backdrop, and I loved the cascading waves of their sound in Un Pensiero Nemico Di Pace and Sparga Il Senso Lascivo Veleno, plus spectacular trumpet playing, but this is really one woman show, and in showstoppers like All'arme si accesi guerrieri or Sparga il senso, Cecilia is on fire.<br />And then there are these gentle breezes arias, and one of them, No 2, Mentre io godo, is among the most beautiful pieces of music I have heard this year. The famously recycled Lascia la spina and everybody's favourite Vanne Pentita are also perfect. Cecilia means what she sings, and her attention to text is a notch above many of her contemporaries; only madrigal singers usually get so engaged with the words, but in the HIP circles, and especially at these breakneck Baroque speeds, not many singers can hold the fort. Certainly she can ham it up in her interpretations, but on this album it works, especially in slow, plaintive arias, and her ornamentations are a little crazy but very exciting.<br />Even if you still have doubts about some of Cecilia's vocal and stylistic choices, this album is too good to pass, and for anyone even vaguely interested in exquisite performance of unusual Baroque repertoire, this is a great splash, La Dolce Vita style, in the fountain of Santa Cecilia.ezes arias, and one of them, No 2, Mentre io godo, is among the most beautiful pieces of music I have heard this year.

B00005JO1P|4.0|\\"Walk the Line\\" is a good film with very good performances.<br /><br />Virtually every great artist has one thing in common. At some point in their life, they abused alcohol, drugs, the opposite sex, their lover(s), their children, themselves, friendships or a combination of any of the above. In many cases, they overcame these problems to go on and create even more outstanding work, cementing their reputations in history. For a few of these people, the problems proved too much, bringing a premature end to a promising life. Hollywood executives recognize that either scenario is pretty much guaranteed to help create an interesting film because each is inherently filled with drama. Therefore, it stands to reason that any biopic of a musician will feature the same element, the lead character overcoming an obstacle. Without this, the story wouldn't be as interesting.<br /><br />Because we know that a biopic of a musician is going to feature a struggle, of some type, some of the inherent drama dissipates. It would, after all, be boring to watch a film about an artist who has a great life, no problems, everything is rosy. Fortunately, the last few musician biopics have married their familiar stories with great performances and good to great directing, enhancing our appreciation of their life. Last year's \\"Ray\\" features an outstanding performance by Jamie Foxx, who brings the character to life, with the aid of director Taylor Hackford.<br /><br />If \\"Walk the Line\\", the new biopic about Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash, were made a few years from now, there would be fewer comparisons to the Ray Charles film. But as it comes on the heels, comparisons are inevitable and will be plentiful.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix does a good job of bringing singer Johnny Cash to life. He doesn't really attempt to imitate the icon as much as interpret his life. At times, especially when singing, Phoenix's voice attains the deep, resonant timber of Cash's, but he doesn't walk around mimicking throughout. This seems entirely natural. When he is performing, singing, his stage persona is different, selling himself as a character to his adoring fans.<br /><br />At times, I found myself thinking \\"Wow, Joaquin Phoenix is doing a good job.\\" More often than not, Phoenix was doing a good job acting. Phoenix acts, he doesn't become. Because we are pulled out of the performance like this, recognizing his work as an actor, he doesn't completely transform himself into the singer. Jamie Foxx managed this on a much more consistent basis, transforming himself into Ray Charles. He became the singer, losing himself in the mannerisms, speech and actions of the singer. In a way, Foxx was mimicking Charles, but he was doing this so completely and successfully he got lost in the character.<br /><br />Remarkably, Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon did all of their own singing and this is where Phoenix really shines. As mentioned, his voice reaches a deeper timber, reminiscent of the singer's and it is difficult to tell that it isn't Cash singing. I am not overly familiar with the Johnny Cash songbook, but when Phoenix sings, the signature tunes sure sound authentic.<br /><br />Reese Witherspoon plays June Carter, the love of Johnny Cash's life. I think people are generally much less familiar with her life and her work, so Witherspoon has a great deal more latitude in her performance, building a three dimensional character. Because she is able to more fully become \\"June Carter\\", her character is more successful. Witherspoon brings all of the facets of June's life to the screen; she conveys her conflicts with her religion when she gets divorced (for the first time), she conveys her friendship for Johnny, her ability to help him through his addiction, her onstage persona and more.<br /><br />Reese Witherspoon also does her own vocals throughout. In Witherspoon's case, it is easier to tell that it is the actress singing. Her voice doesn't change and you recognize her accent throughout. I can honestly say I wouldn't recognize a song sung by the real June Carter Cash, so I have nothing to compare her vocal abilities to, but she also sounds good.<br /><br />The two performances are very good, but it is strange that the actor portraying the less recognizable person should be more successful. Both actors are probably doing comparable work, but because we know more about Johnny Cash, recognize him as an icon, Phoenix has to work harder to make his performance seem interesting, believable and real. Ultimately, Phoenix does a better job with the singing and Witherspoon does a better job with her acting.<br /><br />The film opens with inmates at Folsom Prison chanting and stomping their feet, trying to get Cash to come back from a break and continue the concert. As Cash pauses, trying to relax, he remembers back to his childhood. This is a fairly conventional setup for a biopic. Many recent film biographies wisely chose to depict only a portion of the subject's life, concentrating on this period, going into more depth. In \\"Walk the Line\\", the majority of the film tells the story of Cash's life from twelve year old cotton picker to his performance at Folsom Prison. The performance at Folsom provides a natural climax for the film and his story. And it is a great sequence, with Phoenix channeling the spirit of Johnny Cash, but the real point of this story is the romance between Johnny and June, so the film continues on for a bit until June finally agrees to marry Johnny. This is an interesting moment, and the two clearly loved one another, but the film really should've ended with the performance at Folsom. Continuing on, it seems anticlimactic.<br /><br />Director James Mangold does a good, if unspectacular job with the material. Yes, everything looks good, but the film doesn't match the quality of the performances from the two leads. Mangold's work is a bit disappointing because the film is a really straightforward biopic. The director's previous work includes \\"Identity\\", a really underrated thriller with a twist, and \\"Heavy\\", his first film, also an underrated independent film. With the exception of the turkey \\"Kate and Leopold\\", Mangold's earlier work contains elements that help it rise above the pack. He has shown that he isn't content simply making a big budget studio picture. In \\"Walk the Line\\"; he pretty much leaves the visual elements alone, photographing everything in a very straight forward and simple way. Everything looks good, but it doesn't contain any artistic flair.<br /><br />Also, there are more than a few scenes involving Johnny, June and a number of other rising musicians touring on the same circuit. These rising musicians included Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley, Merle Haggard, Carl Perkins and Roy Orbison. Jerry Lee Lewis is given the most screen time of the group and the actor playing him, Waylon Payne, seems to have a lot of fun bringing the outrageous musician to life. The remainder of the group sticks mainly to the sidelines, offering brief glimpses of them before and after they perform. Because we see so little of them, except for a few of the familiar iconic trademarks of Presley and Orbison, they seem to be almost cartoon characters, they serve as distractions, pulling us out of the story every time they appear. Cash says something to Elvis as they pass during a concert, then Cash stops to watch Elvis perform for a few moments. Then our attention is drawn to the audience is looking at Elvis on stage and the actor playing him. \\"Oh, so he knew Elvis...\\" At this point, it takes a few moments to get lost in the film again. It would have been better to actually never see these characters, maybe only catching glimpses of them, from the wings, or from behind, the bright stage lights obscuring their features.<br /><br />A biopic should teach you something significant about the subject's life, something you didn't already know. Because \\"Walk the Line\\" is about two people, we should learn something about both of the characters. Ultimately, we learn more about June Carter, through Witherspoon's performance, partly because of the actor's work and partly because we know less about Johnny Cash's true love than we do about the iconic singer.r's previous work includes \\"Identity\\", a really underrated thriller with a twist, and \\"Heavy\\", his first film, also an underrated independent film.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|I have to say that this has to be Madonna's best album since RAY OF LIGHT...and actually perhaps her best period.  This album goes a long way of solidifying the spiritual place that Madonna is right now along with the great beats that she is known for.  I am really glad that she moved away from Mirwais as her only co-producer.  Madge was in need of a new musical direction, and DJ Stuart Price seems like a perfect match.  These songs are in between Mirwais' \\"hard\\" house sound and William Orbit's ambient tranceness of the RAY OF LIGHT songs.  Excellent! <br /> <br />The best songs on this album have to be \\"Sorry\\", \\"Let It Will Be\\", \\"Jump\\", \\"Forbidden Love\\", and my personal favorite because of the great percussion, \\"Push\\".  All of the tracks are great, and you'll find yourself listening to the whole album as you drive, work, or whatever.  \\"I Love NY\\" has to be the most fun of the tracks....and could even be a great single. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a great Madonna album.  I am really looking forward to the remixes that will come from it, as well as the other singles.  Madonna is back and in fine form.  Way to go, girl!
B000002MUW|3.0|The theme of this album is R&B. And once again, Madonna shines through and proves to us that she's capable of anything. But there's one exception. The entire album is of an R&B feel with the exception of the title track. Co-written by Bjork, the song itself is great. But Bjork is not R&B. The song \\"Bedtime Story\\" is not R&B at all. It's electronica, Bjork style. This song belongs on the \\"Ray of Light\\" album. \\"Bedtime Story\\" was a single. I heard it on the radio ONE time. And then it disappeared never to be heard again. Why? Because it's too weird for the general public. Bjork is not \\"radio\\" material. I can't stand the radio myself, but my question is why did Madonna put such an eccentric song which is clearly electronica, on an R&B album?
B000A0GP0Y|2.0|The only reason I gave this poop 2 stars is for the role oc Chris Rock .... unfortunately he doesn't make it through the wole movie ..... I mean what they should have done is gotten rid of the guards, the warden and Sandler himself .....  <br /> <br /> <br />Even Burt Reynolds performace was below standard .... I saw ther original and the charaters no matter how mean and nasty had some redeeming values and that is what made this light hearted movie great..... In the remake the mean charactrers actually came across as mean trust me no comedic value of any kind type of mean ....  <br /> <br /> <br />If you hear anyone lagh during this film it's probably cause they are reading messages an their Blackberry !!!
B0009XNUK0|4.0|some people really can't distinguish between the man and the music. whether you like him or not as a person, or think he is in fact a pedophile or not, has nothing to do with this product. i must have missed where they were selling michael jackson himself rather than cds of his music, if you're not actually going to review the product please don't bother; you're wasting the time of people that genuinely want to know about this cd compilation. <br />     anyway, michael's music is amazing. it appeals to people of all generations and musical tastes. this collection offers a pretty good sampling that spans his career from his time with the jackson 5 to his solo hits, you get a little bit of everything, both fans and non-fans will appreciate having it in their cd collections.

B00004BZ0N|5.0|When I first heard this album, I admit I didn't like it. For all the talk about the Clash being one of the first punk bands, this album didn't really sound that punk. It wasn't until later that I realised therein lies it's genius. For a bunch of punks, The Clash were amazing songwriters and could actually play their instruments fairly well (cue Simonon's wicked bass runs in the title track).
B000BO0LLS|3.0|It is good to see Mariah back on top.  However, what's up with releasing 4 VERSIONS of the SAME album????!  I bought the limited edition back in April when the album was originally released.  I was excited that Mariah was back, and perhaps, this would be a better album than CHARMBRACELET.  While it was better, it still had the sameness of the previous few records, so I was a bit disappointed.  So, here we are, November 15 and now there are two more versions to choose from!  What's a fan to do?  I almost passed on this, but I did like her video for \\"IT'S LIKE THAT\\", so I went ahead and got the CD/DVD combo.  Why would you get anything else?  Why would Def Jam even bother with a CD-only version?  This is a disappointing trend that is happening in music where albums are coming out on one date, and then being reissued with extras later.  I think it is not really the artist's fault, but really the record company's because they want to test the waters before they invest a lot of money into an artist's real potential.  In April, they weren't sure how Mariah's album would do, but with the huge success of \\"WE BELONG TOGETHER\\", Def Jam decided to go ahead with this Ultra Platinum re-release.  I have to say that of the four new tracks, three are outstanding.  The duet remix with Twista of \\"One And Only\\" is great and showcases the Mariah we all knew and loved before the Glitter fiasco.  However, the greatest line on the album has to be when Jermaine Dupri exclaims that he's \\"stacked like the International House of Pancakes\\"!  What a laugher!  Every time I hear it, I can't help but laugh!  It's one of the most cheesy rap lines ever, but clever at the same.  What a plug for IHOP! <br /> <br />Like other reviewers, if you haven't bought this album already, just go ahead and get this one with the CD and DVD.  At least the videos and extra tracks are worth it, even if the main album is disappointing.  I subtracted one star for the disappointment of the main album and one for multi-version mayhem.  Ultimately, you'll have to judge for yourself on this one.
0553801503|2.0|I loved the first three books.  This book reminds me of Robert Jordan's \\"Wheel of Time\\", if you read it.  It started out great and then just took a detour.  Book focuses on too many characters and much plotting by them.  I think this book lost focus all together compared to the previous three books.  I have a feeling that if I skip this book altogether and read the next one I wouldn't miss much.  Granted the next book is in line with the first three.   <br /> <br />Author gives very good description of places and characters travel but nothing happens.  Some minor character got killed here and there, another character took its place and that is about it. <br /> <br />Very disappointing, but still gave it two starts because the first three books were GREAT and hoping the next book will be like the first three. <br />
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Hi: It's so nice to hear our lady singing back over real danceable tunes, not over futuristic spiritual syncs. Best cuts in my opinion are \\"Get Together\\" and \\"Jump\\" ( can't hardly wait for mixes of those songs). Price's work is awesome. I was a young Madonna fan in the late 80's and I like the way she has evolved, though I'd love to see her teaming up again with Patrick Leonard ( her best work ever), Stephen Bray and perhaps Shep Pettibone. Things has change since those days, so we have, so she has. Great work...Wonderful artwork and cover ( I hated the Erotica and the American Life covers ).
B000B8QF14|5.0|This CD/DVD combo is a great time capsule of one of the best concerts of 2005. The intermingling of interview segments on the DVD is nice, but I wish they would have been made their own chapters for easier skipping around.  <br /> <br />Sam Bayer, who directed all the American Idiot videos, is back to helm this undertaking; and the visual style remains consistent with the recent videos. <br /> <br />The DVD sound is great in the Dolby Digital mix. The picture is good quality from the different mix of film and video. <br /> <br />Having seen the show live myself, its a nice keepsake to look back on. American Idiot is one of, if not the best album of the past ten years, and the live performances rock just as well as the studio CD.
B000BO0LKY|1.0|The fact that Mariah has somehow managed to crawl out of the ashes of Glitter and back into heavy radio rotation with such terribly predictable and uninteresting music as this has made me lose complete faith in music in the this country. She wasn't bad ten years ago but her new material is trash. Lots of mediocre R&B guest stars shouldn't be a selling point for a record. Hopefully next time around all the young kids who thought this kind of music was great will grow up and realize how regurgitated it is and decide not to purchase another amateurish CD from Mimi. I suggest picking up something from Janet Jackson in the 80's since that's clearly who she's trying to emulate.
0784011680|5.0|It must be enormously difficult to produce a worthy biographical movie, the subject matter can be less clourful than the \\"Famous\\" persona suggests. Critical scrutiny of the work is always going to be harsh and purist, particularly from family and the fan base. Chaplin is a more rounded and colourful subject than most but that notion in itself would not make the project easy.<br /><br />Attenborough does a sterling job given that the story has to span several decades of enormous change, incorporate a massive cast and demonstrate Chaplin's artistic importance as well as the complexities of his personal life.<br /><br />Downey Jr is an outstanding star and gives Chaplin a a fuller and more human character and face which is at once tragic, loving, driven,even sexy. His British accent is impeccable, I actually for got he is American very early on which is praise indeed from a native Brit, his Englishness was far better than Rees's Americanisation (the actor who plays Sydney Chaplin and is actually British, he is great in the role nonetheless).<br /><br />Downey Jr also manages to portray a sense of iron hard strength and lost and lonely vulnerability that were the essential components of Chaplin's personality. Downey Jr also works hard to get a sense of Chaplin's balletic, choreographed comedy. Essential viewing, Downey Jr was most definitely robbed of the Oscar for this role, he did however win the BAFTA for it (British Academy Film and Television Award).

B00000I8UF|5.0|This is truly one of the handful of cd's that is impossible to overrate;it's one of a handful of albums I'd use as  an intro to jazz. I can listen to this and 'Song For My Father' by Horace Silver,indefinately,without deciding which hard-bop cd wins.Everybody on this cd- pianist Bobby Timmons,who composed the unforgettable title track, Benny Golson on tenor sax and composer of 4 cuts,including the jazz standard 'Along Came Betty',Art Blakey,who tears it up on drums and maybe,especially,for anyone who's a fan of trumpeter Lee Morgan-'Moanin' is a can't miss.
1558908374|4.0|In 1996, Disney remade the animated classic \\"One Hundred and One Dalmatians\\" into a live-action movie.  The plot was kept very similar to the original, with enough variation from the original to keep the plot fresh.  I found this version to be enjoyable and sufficiently family friendly that I have enjoyed watching it more than once.<br /><br />Cruella De Vil (Glenn Close) is a fashion maven who loves fur.  Cruella is also more than a little wacko.  Anita (Joely Richardson) is a mousy designer who designs new fashions for Cruella.  Off in another orbit, Roger (Jeff Daniels) is an unsuccessful geek video game designer.  All is well with the world until Roger and Anita's paths cross, courtesy of Pongo and Perdita, their pet Dalmatians.  One splash in the pond leads to another, and the next thing you know everyone is married.<br /><br />Somewhere along the line we learn that Cruella's latest love is spotted fur, and Cruella has her eye on Dalmatians to provide her with a new fur coat.  Initially Anita and Roger are blissfully unaware of Cruella's new obsession, until Cruella attempts to buy the puppies.  After Anita and Roger refuse, Cruella calls on two bumbling henchmen Jasper (Hugh Laurie) and Horace (Mark Williams) to steal the puppies.  Fortunately for all the dogs are smarter than the bad guys and the good guys alike, because they end up needing to save themselves.<br /><br />The beginning of this movie is a bit cumbersome and barely held my interest.  However, once the dogs take center stage the movie picks up and gets quite funny in places.  When the dogs take over in the search for the puppies and then plot the escape of the puppies I got several good laughs and a lot of smiles.  Even better, Cruella De Vil is sufficiently cartoonish that she is unlikely to scare nearly anyone, which is why this movie is rated G.<br /><br />There is always danger in remakes.  However, I think this remake works.  This remake does not replace the original, but is an addition to the original that can stand side-by-side with it.  Each version has its charms, and I will resist the temptation to compare the two very much, instead leaving it to the discerning viewer to determine whether they have a favorite.ion to the original that can stand side-by-side with it.

B00000DRXW|5.0|The first time I heard this recording I thought it had been sped up in the mastering process. I simply couldn't imagine three musicians playing at such breakneck tempo's, plucking strings at such amazing divisions, and all of it with seeming effortlessness. In many respects this was the end of the fusion era. Dimeola has never again played with such intensity, Mclaughlin has never been so competitive, and Paco may have outshone them all. The fact that there is no professional recording on film of this concert is an extraordinary tragedy. This is the most mind blowing acoustic guitar playing ever...until....<br /><br />Strunz and Farah's \\"Frontera\\", the absolute pinnacle of guitar brilliance and speed, followed by the even more astonishing \\"Guitarras\\". The Dimeola, Mclaughlin, DeLucia trio set the bar. It was broken in 1984 by Jorge Strunz and Ardeshir Farah and THAT bar has yet to be broken.
B00005JNQS|3.0|It started off promising, but after the first 15 minutes it started to drag.  I really enjoyed the last five minutes too.  The animation was incredible, as it usually is with these films.  But as far as the story goes, not quite as amazing.  It's still worth seeing, but I think kids will enjoy it the most.  There is some adult humor in it too.

B000000OAN|5.0|It is very difficult for me to decide on which is my favorite Queen album, but this is one of the best. It is as close to perfect as even Queen could get. From the venemous opening tune \\"Death On Two Legs\\" you are entranced by the amazing variety of music on one album. \\"39\\" is a folk style wonder, and \\"Seaside Rendevous\\" is one of Freddie's campiest and most fun tunes. \\"The Prophet's Song\\" is an illustrious multi-tempo rock classic that should not be missed. The one and only \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" and \\"You're My Best Friend\\" are included, but only a part of an album that is classic from beginning to end. I wanted to add that this was just voted best album of the 70s on votenumber1.com. Freddie voted best male vocalist, and Queen best group of all time. Bohemian Rhapsody was best single ever. More reason to add this classic to your collection.

B000068CNX|5.0|Season two is basically where the R&R story began. TOW Ross' New Girlfriend showed how Ross' once jealousy has now taken position inside Rachel, because when ever she sees Ross and Julie together she feels like what Ross felt when she was with Paolo. In TOW Ross Finds Out, our favorite couple finally realize how good they are together, which took a downtoll in TOW The List where Ross makes lists about all the bad things about Rachel and Julie, and Rachel accidentally reads it. For a few episodes there we thought we'd never see Ross and Rachel together, but BAM! There they are, as a happy couple! (If you want to savior these moments, don't move on to Season 3 any sooner!)  <br /> <br />This season also shows us some of Chandler's side. TOW Heckles Dies is technically Chandler's episode where his problems and habits are revealed. He was SO stressed he called Janice! (\\"Janice? You called JANICE?!\\" Phoebe questions to Chandler when he's at the coffeehouse) Well, Janice turns up, but with a little surprise. Later, Chandler can't stop thinking about his date's huge head.  <br /> <br />Joey and Chandler's friendship enters some problematics when Joey decides to move into an apartment where he can live by himself, leaving Chandler on his own and missing a friend, which makes him get another roommate who turns out to be a fruit-drying-psycopath! But, all things turn out well, Chandler tricks Eddie (his replacement roommate) into thinking he doesn't live in the apartment anymore, and Joey moves back in.  <br /> <br />Ross' discomforts toward Carol and Susan's relationship takes a absolutely unexpected turn as the two women decide to get married. Ross says he won't go, but when Carol's parents aren't willing to be a part of the wedding, Ross agrees to coming there and give Carol away. <br /> <br />Monica finds love in a old family friend who is 50, leaving Ross to deal with a lot. While on their dad's birthday party, Monica decides to tell her parents. Ross, terrified as he is, makes sure when the moment hits, neither of his parents have anything to throw at Richard or Monica or possibly anything they could be hit with.  <br /> <br />The situations all wrap up and this season ends in TOW Barry and Mindy's Wedding. Rachel goes there wearing something that looks like something 'you drink where you're nauseous' and ends up giving some stupid impression. But something Barry says while she's attempting to leave while not insulting her but giving her the power to be strong and sing Copacabanna infront of the guests which was celebrated and sang along with a lot. Then finally the episode ends with Chandler waiting for his internet-mystery girlfriend who turns out to be....you watch for yourself!  <br /> <br />This season is very good and I'd recommend you buy this dvd.
B000002B1M|5.0|Nas comes back again, with \\"It Was Written\\".  It is truly one of the most creative LP's to hit stores.  I can't even fatham the type of influences that Nas had when he wrote, \\"I gave you power\\" but the concept that he is constantly being used like gun, and described his life metaphoricly related to a gun is incredible!!!  That is mad deep.  Also, on a side note, he is one of the best lyricist ever to bless a mic.  Another stand out track:<br /><br />  \\"Black Girl Lost\\".  This is why:<br /><br />This is a dedication song to the black woman.  Most sistas are off point with Afrocentricity, and disrespect their fellow black man.  They don't know their place.  They want man power, man respect, and man props, but they are still women, and this song expresses just that; as Nas states, \\".....Wanting more from a college degree.\\"  .........Again, classic hotness.<br /><br />Live N!gga Rap:  Classic Nas & Mobb Depp hotness.  Once again Nas outshines his features and Havoc makes the hot track.  Dope through and through.<br /><br />Take it in Blood:  Again classic.  He starts off with classic hotness saying, \\"I never brag how real I keep it/ cause its the best secret\\".  Later he says in the song he states, \\"Why shoot the breeze about it?/When you can be about it?\\"  It's a simple line, but its a quote to live by FO, REAL!!!!!!!<br /><br />That is what I like about Nas, he can rhyme with intelligence, and educate the youth, and bless a tight track.<br /><br />The production on this album was tight also.  He even had guest production from Dr. Dre, and Nas wrote a superior verse on \\"Affirmitave Action\\" for ol' fine @$$ & slutty @$$ Foxy Brown.  She made it sound tight, although it was still Nas'verse.<br /><br />To sum it all up, there isn't any skip material on here neither.  It is a tight album, and still worth being bought.<br /><br />Peace!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />P.S.  Watch dem N!iggas that's close to you.........never personal nowadays that's the ways!!!!!

B000B8QEZG|4.0|This album actually sounds like a remixed sequel to Ray of Light. This album was wisely sequenced like a dj set which gives it a begining a middle and an end. All the tracks compliment each other making this not just another cd full of singles which was Music and American Life biggest crime. This cd is purely for fun and fun Madonna is much better than pissed off Madonna at least on cd's.
B000050XEI|5.0|An incredible CD incorporating Enya's beautiful voice with enchanting music throughout. Wild Child, Only Time and One By One are my favorite tracks although every other demonstrates a variety of tones and overall arrangement that compromises little. Enya remains a truly gifted, spontaneous talent that gives most any listener the chance to relax and settle one's thoughts. Am curious as to what her up and coming release Amarantine has to offer although to surpass the elegance of A Day Without Rain indeed could impose an interesting challenge.
B000002MU3|5.0|So maybe you've read lots of reviews here and you're still not sure what to make of the Monster. Well, theoretically speaking, if REM released a challenging, dynamic, rewarding, kick-butt rock & roll album that demanded to be listened to loud under various mindsets, it would get the same reaction that Monster has been getting.  <br /> <br />This album still makes me giddy. God bless REM and their vision and talent for creating this masterpiece.
B00008G68W|1.0|By many accounts, this movie was poorly made; certainly not one of Ridley Scott's finest moments.<br /><br />The second reason this movie is not good is its take on historical fiction. Columbus is portrayed as a tolerant and patient man, kind to the natives. He also portrayed as a man of science. Nothing could be further from the truth. The first thing Columbus did was write about enslaving the natives and showed little to no concern for their welfare. While Columbus utilized the most advanced technology of the time, he put most of his faith in religion and mysticism - hardly the characteristics of a man of reason and science.<br /><br />Historical fiction can be forgiven if it is entertaining (like Scott's Gladiator). But going too far by including many historical inaccuracies (like The Patriot) distracts from an otherwise good movie (like The Patriot). Unfortunately, this movie combines the worst of both: not entertaining or historically accurate.

B00082IJ08|5.0|Right now, I'm working on an essay. This is the first time I've listened to the albulm; generally I second-guess myself after I listen to a CD because money is so tight, but this CD is excellent. I thought that their first CD was great and actually didn't want to get this one out of the fear that it would'nt be as good as the one I own... but I actually like this one better. It sounds more mature and every song is easy to dance and listen to.
B00005MP58|1.0|I cannot agree more with previous reviews- this is the best adaptation of Pride & Prejudice yet, but the DVD is beyond sucking. The 2015 version is no better. I have the VHS tape set as well, which is perfect. The DVD in contrast is poorly formatted, comes across as a cheap copy with washed out bluish colors and muted sound. I have been through 2 DVDs thinking the first one was a fluke. DEFINATELY don't buy this until A&E re-releases it. The VHS tapes are wonderful, IF you still own a VHS recorder...
B000062XGF|5.0|This is a terrific latter day thriller that brings to mind the work of Hitchcock.  The plot twists are clever yet plausible.  The motives of the main characters and true identities are shadowy which adds to the intrigue of the film.  The film looks terrific and the action and stuntwork are excellent.  The film is anchored by two dynamic performances by Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones.  At the time much was made of the age difference between the two(Connery was 67 and Zeta-Jones was 29) but the chemistry between the two makes it a non-factor.  Connery, in probably his last film that required grueling physical exertion, shows that in the twilight of a storied career that he won't go quietly into the night.  This was Zeta-Jones' second American film. In her first, \\"The Mask of Zorro\\", she was good but her role there did not have the heft of \\"Entrapment\\".  Aside from her natural beauty that just explodes on screen she more than holds her own with Connery.  There is a mystique to her character, an insurance investigator who is out to ensnare Connery's thief.  Good supporting turns are also given by Will Patten as Zeta-Jones' co-worker and Ving Rhames as an associate of Connery's.  If I recall the reviews at the time of the film's release it was generally dismissed as a slick thriller.  I think those reviewers should revisit this film and discover it's merits.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Well, to start with, this is no Toxicity. It just doesn't quite have the masterpiece feel that Toxicity had. That said, this CD isn't that bad. The major downfall (in my opinion) was the singing...not by Serj, of course, because everything he does is insane, but I just wasn't that fond of Daron's voice in the lead, with a few exceptions. <br /> <br />1) Soldier Side/Intro - slightyly erie, quite intro to the CD 4/5 <br />2) BYOB - Incredible politically heavy song 5/5 <br />3) Revenga - very fast lyrics and then an odd chorus 4/5 <br />4) Cigaro - The worst song on the CD. Daron leads and I just never got into his voice 1/5 <br />5) Radio/Video - The music in this took a bit of getting used to, but pretty good 4/5 <br />6) This Cocaine Makes me Feel Like I'm on This Song - OK 3/5 <br />7) Violent Pornography - This song always makes me laugh 5/5 <br />8) Question - The best guitar work, an interesting blend of heavy and melodic. Best song on the CD 5/5 <br />9) Sad Statue - Another political stab, this time at war and the statue of liberty. 3/5 <br />10) Old School Hollywood - Not crazy about Daron's singing here, but the chorus is pretty cool 3.5/5 <br />11) Lost in Hollywood - The only song that features Daron that I really liked. This one is similar in sound to the first track...erie and slower 5/5 <br /> <br />Overall a four out of five. <br /> <br />Now then, even though it isn't out yet, I've gotten to listen to their next CD, Hypnotize, and I have some news for you: bad news if you don't like Daron singing and good news if you do. Hypnotize is flooded with Daron as singer. <br /> <br />1) Attack - Furiously fast intro to sudden quite, then furious again. 4/5 <br />2) Dreaming - Incredibly fast verses with calmer chorus. Great blend of voices on this song 5/5 <br />3) Kill Rock 'N Roll - Starts off sounding great, then Daron starts singing. Chorus isn't bad, but I just can't get around Daron's voice. 2/5 <br />4) Hypnotize - Quite political song with cool guitar sounds at one point 4/5 <br />5) Stealing Society - OK 3/5 <br />6) Tentative - Chorus is cool, verses take a little getting used to 4/5 <br />7) U-Fig - Just doesn't stand out 3/5 <br />8) Holy Mountains - Quite song for the most part. Very good lyrics. 4.5/5 <br />9) Vicinity of Obscenity - Easily the oddest song on the CD. Think Toxicity's oddness times about 3 million. Very fast lyrics 5/5 <br />10) She's Like Herion - Daron leads again. 2/5 <br />11) Lonely Day - Quite song. Not bad, but doesn't really catch your attention 3.5/5 <br />12) Soldier Slide - Great song. Probably the best on the CD. 5/5 <br /> <br />Some parts of this CD are pretty good, but on the whole I'd much rather listen to Toxicity or Mezmerize. 3.5/5
B0002XVQNU|3.0|Like most comic-based movies, this has a fairly predictable recipe:   <br /> <br />*1 big-name actor (regardless of whether or not he actually fits the role) <br /> <br />*1 hottie for a female sidekick/femme fatale/love-interest-who-becomes-a-weakness-for-our-hero <br /> <br />*1-3 bad guys with over-the-top powers, at least one of which must be able to construct an evil empire without anyone in law enforcement noticing <br /> <br />*a mild-mannered sidekick with little actual ability, yet who manages to provide a pivotal role in saving the day <br /> <br />Combine all ingredients in a city with less daylight than Anchorage in January, add a few well-placed spotlights to allow our hero to scare muggers with giant threatening shadowpuppets, and toss in a pinch of dark, industrial music.  Done.  Easier than making Nachos (which go great with any film, by the way).   <br /> <br />OK, that being said, once you accept that the above recipe will be followed to the letter, you can sit back and enjoy this movie for what it is.  It's an action flick with a troubled, but ultimately noble, hero who triumphs to fight evil another day.   <br /> <br />I would have been a little annoyed to sit through this in the theatre.  For the cost of a DVD, though, not too bad, though.  And the directors' cut extras are worth it.
B0009YKWAK|4.0|Two of Hollywood's biggest names, Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman, and a highly respected director, Sidney Pollack, come together for the exciting and intelligent thriller, `The Interpreter'.  <br /> <br />Nicole Kidman stars as Silvia Broome, a UN interpreter who, upon returning late one night to collect some belongings, overhears a threat to the life of the controversial leader of her African country. The catch is, it was in a dialect that only she and a handful of others speak. Then comes Tobin Keller, the Federal agent sent both to protect her and investigate her claims. With her political background and the uncommon dialect of the threats, however, Keller is sceptical of whether she is really telling the truth. The story unfolds, with threats to Silvia's life and the arrival of the political head in question, and finishes with a twist you won't see coming. <br /> <br />Kidman and Penn are solid in their leading roles, and Catherine Keener gives a great performance as Keller's sarcastic (and undershown) assistant. Whilst Silvia is a complex and at times uncertain character, Tobin Keller comes across as the stereotypical overworking Agent with family problems. Fortunately, however, Sean Penn manages to still make this role interesting. The plot, though at times a little hard to follow, is clever and will keep you guessing and surprised at the turns the film takes. The other remarkable aspect of the film is that it is the first (and as yet only) time that filming has been permitted in the majestic UN headquarters. This not only adds to the realism of the movie, but is a magnificent setting to watch the events unfold in. <br /> <br />The DVD also features several notable bonus features. There is an alternative ending to the film as well as trailers and deleted scenes. Then there are a number of segments featuring interviews with some members of the cast and the director, Sidney Pollack. Firstly there is a feature on the making of films by Pollack, showing behind the scenes of the director at work. A segment on the United Nations building shows the rooms of the great building both through shots from the film and other footage, and also provides information on the UN and the filming of the movie in the headquarters. This makes for interesting viewing and is one of the best of the bonus features. The other standout feature is one on the vocation of actual interpreters. This features interviews with some UN interpreters and also the Pollack and Nicole Kidman. As well as these, there is an audio commentary for the film done by Pollack and the director talks in a segment about the choice of film format for his movies.  <br /> <br />`The Interpreter', though at times difficult to follow, is an excellent film, featuring some of Hollywood's most popular and skilled actors and director. Though not perfect, this is a thoroughly enjoyable thriller that I recommend seeing.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|After watching the series for the first time a couple weeks ago I was astounded that it was cancelled after 11 episodes. It captured the essence of adventure so well and the chemistry between the cast was just perfect. This movie takes everything from the series and expands upon its awesomeness even more. If you have any interest in sci-fi, adventure, space operas, the old west, or anything remotely like that then buy this dvd asap.
B00008976Y|3.0|Kieslowki has a way with the camera, beautiful cinematography of ordinary, banal life, objects, and lighting effects.  These effects are concentrated in the blue spectrum, one color of the French Flag, which has a meaning - Liberty.  <br /> <br />I'm all for symbolism or metaphor in art.  Most fail at these artistic endeavors, but Blue is a good try.  Juliette Binoche has lost her composer husband and daughter in an auto crash.  She sells all her earthly belongings, keeping enough to live in a Paris flat and join a swim club.  She meets the prostitute downstairs and there's a bit of existential comparisons about lifestyle.  Hey, this film is French.   <br /> <br />The weakness -- the plot barely keeps the film alive.  The colors are beautiful, but not enough to keep me interested in these \\"suffering\\" Frenchies.  More Grande Pompon, please! <br />

B000002I8D|5.0|(this is less of a review than it is something to keep in mind or notice) <br /> <br />At the end of Tomorrow Never Knows, Phil sings a portion of Somewhere Over the Rainbow.  It is faint, but with close listening can be heard. <br />I think that this album is great, but unfortunately after this Phil went down hill for me.  I think that he tried to be too commercial on subsequent recordings.
B00004SC3M|2.0|SHE:  Oh, my god!<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />HE:  You sound surprised.<br /><br />SHE:  No, it's just not what I expected.<br /><br />The dialogue doesn't get much better in \\"Entrapment\\".  She also says \\"Wow!\\" a lot, generally expressing herself with a teenager's vocabulary (and impetuosity), which seems to indicate a more intuitive, spontaneous thinking process than one might expect from a highly intelligent and methodical art thief.  He, on the other hand, mutters and grunts his observations in as thick a Scottish brogue as he can muster.  He's the organization man to her acrobat, explaining the basic ground rules of thievery, such as \\"Never trust a naked woman\\".  This will, needless to say, lead to some awkwardness in their partnership, culminating in a tussle which ends with him backing out on the grounds that \\"My situation is just too complicated.\\"  (War injury?  Forgot his Viagra?  We can't be sure.)  If you're looking for romantic tension, try \\"Roman Holiday\\".  If you're looking for a convincing heist scene, \\"Revenge of the Pink Panther\\" does as good a job, with humor as a bonus. If you're looking for scenes of the Zeta-Jones butt gyrating in tight black leather pants, you can buy the DVD and just turn on the disc menu which shows it from every angle for as long as you want.  Or try \\"Chicago\\", where she does some mean dancing, and proves she can even act.
0679731725|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. The hardest thing about the book is understanding what England was like during this time period. I would advise doing a little bit of research just to get some background information, the story will make a whole lot more sense. Also, this isn't one of those books you can read a little bit then put down and start again a few weeks later you will miss something. You may even have to read the book two times to really see the subtle passion within the main character, Mr. Stevens and the highly questionable romance between him and another servant in the Darlington house Miss. Kenton. This book has everything rolled into one-love, war, death, economy etc.
0805028846|5.0|I own several books on pop-up techniques and this is one of my favorites. This is a large format, beautifully illustrated book filled with sound, easy to learn techniques, well-photographed and explained. It also includes lovely examples of more professional work using the techniques which serve as a gallery of inspiration. Jackson is a natural instructor whose passion for paper engineering is infectious.     In answer to the reviewers who were disappointed that this doesn't spoon feed you exact projects to slavishly copy down to the last fraction of an inch, there are examples to copy in here, but I don't believe that was the point of this book.  The step by step examples are actually quite good, but this isn't meant to be a pattern book to cut out or copy and then glue together.  The point is to allow the reader/user to master the basics of paper engineering techniques and materials so that the reader can then make his/her own projects.   The step by step examples are meant as teaching tools. The point of the book is to learn skills, be inspired by photographed examples, and to use this as a starting point for creating your own work.      The author did do another which I believe is called \\"Paper Pop ups\\" that does have page after page of pop ups that you can cut out or copy and glue together, and there are some other wonderful pop ups in there that are not in this one.  However, one of the things I love about this book is that it clearly explains the basics for someone who is unfamiliar with the techniques, yet it isn't dumbed down. He teaches you skills and provides pictures of examples that provide a foundation for using your imagination so you can create, rather than copy templates.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Great album.  I just wished there were more infrctuous melodies like \\"Hung Up\\".  Still....quite an accomplishment production-wise and musically. Madonna continues to be a creative force that knows where to look to make great music!  Thanks Madonna for choosing to sample the best pop band in the world and thanks Benny, Bjorn, Frida, and Agnetha (ABBA!) for allowing Madonna to make a masterpiece from a previous masterpiece in the most creative and fun way!
B00004Z400|5.0|A lot of ink (actual and electronic) has been dedicated to nu-metal over the past five or so years.  To be honest, it pretty much died circa 2003 when the last act to come from it with any sort of mainstream appeal released an overwhelmingly average album (Linkin Park).  Since then we've still had to endure the likes of Crossfade and god knows who else, so it's hard to remember why nu-metal actually held any appeal. <br /> <br />Yeah, it played mostly to angry, white, suburban males who could get off on the dumbass parading of Limp Bizkit or the shallow, petty anger of Disturbed, but there was an undercurrent to the \\"genre\\" that actually produced amazing artists.   <br /> <br />Some would argue that Korn has ceased to be relevant and they'd be right.  But at one point Korn was extremely relevant and extremely talented.  While not having lost their relevance quite yet, the Deftones are another example of nu-metal producing something brilliant.  White Pony is the prime example of this.  In fact, it could probaby be labeled the definitive album of the nu-metal era. <br /> <br />The thing to understand about nu-metal is that it wasn't metal in the way people understand metal.  Nu-metal married elements from multiple genres, most notably taking the sullen, brooding aspects from grunge, the heavy guitars from metal, and (occassionally) the vocal delivery from rap/hip-hop.  So when get down to it nu-metal wasn't really metal.  And then when you look at the White Pony, you realize it's even further from metal.  The White Pony owes as much to '80s alternative acts like the Smiths, the Cure, and My Bloody Valentine as it does to any of the band's metal influences. <br /> <br />So how does an album that forsakes many of it genres' conventions become its definitive recording?  In part for that very reason, and in part for simply amazing songwriting.  The fact that more experimental songs like \\"Knife Party\\" and \\"Digital Bath\\" can sit alongside more traditional excercises in nu-metal anger like \\"Elite\\", and not feel out of place is a testament to that.   <br /> <br />It's rare that venturing too far from a band's safe-zone will pay off but that's exactly what happens here.  The swooning chorus for \\"Change (In the House of Flies)\\" doesn't feel too far removed from \\"Be Quite And Drive (Far Away)\\", but when you consider that, that song almost felt out of place in the album it was on, you can see that the band had already started to take risks.  The White Pony ended up being their ultimate risk and to date their biggest success (if not commercially, then artistically). <br /> <br />The other thing to consider about the album is the lyrics.  While I've never been one to subscribe to the notion that song lyrics are life-altering pieces of literature, there's something to be said for intelligent writing.  And that's exactly what can be found on White Pony. <br /> <br />One of the more unique aspects of the lyrics is that lead singer Chino Moreno once again has no qualms with venturing outside the mold.  Some are still from the typical depressing, woe-is-me school of thought, but others bring a unique outlook to hard rock.  \\"Passenger\\" for example has dueling lead vocals between Moreno and Tool lead singer Maynard James Keenan, and the lyrics take on a strange, hostage-and-master dichotomy.  By the end of the song it almost sounds as if both minds have become one.  Another interesting track to look at is \\"Elite\\", which uses pregnancy as a metaphor for a failed, one-side realtionship. <br /> <br />I think the only unfortunate aspect of White Pony was its lack of success.  It received moderate airplay on MTV (both \\"Change\\" and \\"Back to School\\" being featured prominently) and moderate airplay on the radio but failed to perform.  I honestly couldn't tell you why it didn't do well.  I just find it troubling that White Pony found only moderate success while much less talented artists like Staind and Drowning Pool went on to sell millions of albums.
B000BGH22W|5.0|For the first three \\"Harry Potter\\" movies, John Williams (\\"Star Wars\\" and numerous other films) composed the music and it awesome. Poignant, touching, entertaining, everything that you could want. John Williams didn't do the music for this movie. Patrick Doyle was called to the task and personally, I think that he performed admirably.<br /><br />\\"Goblet of Fire\\" is a far different film from the first three \\"Potter\\" movies. There are some big things happening, which you almost certainly know about if you're reading this. These demand strong themes and music and Patrick Doyle delivered.<br /><br />I'm not going to give a blow-by-blow track review, but I will touch on some of my favorite tracks. These are \\"The Quidditch World Cup,\\" \\"Golden Egg,\\" \\"Neville's Waltz,\\" \\"Underwater Secrets\\" \\"Hogwarts' March\\" and \\"Magic Works.\\"<br /><br />Some thoughts on a few of these pieces --- \\"The Quidditch World Cup\\" evokes the passion of this great sport and has wonderful Irish music in it as well. There's also the chanting --- \\"Krum... Krum... Krum,\\" it really works. \\"Golden Egg\\" is a partly vocal piece encompassing the song about the mermaids' task and they got a nice female singer to perform it. \\"Neville's Waltz\\" evokes a classical feeling and is also just funny. And then there's \\"Magic Works,\\" a sort of ballad that was played during the closing credits. After listening to it a few times (\\"Believe, that magic works / Don't be afraid / Of being there / Don't let this magic die...\\") you too might just believe that magic works --- if you didn't already! :)<br /><br />I couldn't end this review without mentioning the soundtracks two other vocal pieces --- \\"Do the Hippogriff\\" and \\"This is the Night.\\" \\"Do the Hippogriff\\" is a wild punk rock theme with crazy lyrics like \\"I spin around like a crazy elf, dancin' by himself / I put me down like a unicorn...\\" As long as you don't mind this sort of song, it's good fun. \\"This is the Night\\" is another sort of rock/metal theme and it's decent too. I read that Daniel Radcliffe is a fan of this style of music, so I'm sure he was pleased by those tracks (although, unfortunately for him, I also read that they filmed his scenes separately from all that.)e and it's decent too.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie surprised everyone when it came out. You could either love it or hate it, but it is a classic no matter what cause people keep talking about it. John Hedder is amazing as Napoleon Dynamite, whose life is in focus as he helps his friends Pedro and Ded. His uncle is a scam artist of types, and his brother wants to find his true love. Though a little weird there are some funny moments including the incredible dance sequence at the end. Highly Recommended.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Simply put, this is awlful. How Madonna could stage a production as imaginative & fantastic as the Drowned World Tour and then sink to such dreck as this is incomprehensible. It sounds like she phoned in the lyrics and then the studio went to work with electronic over-production. Billed as a \\"dance\\" record, this is a snooze record. And with ridiculous lyrics like, \\"I don't like cities but I love New York because it doesn't make me feel like a dork\\" it shows she is perhaps so bored & out of touch with reality. Her fans expect & deserve better than this. Check the auctions as my copy is for sale, cheap. Madonna should provide apologies and refunds for this one.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|Yes, there are 4 versions of this CD...no surprise. Most hit \\"urban\\" releases are going this way. We decided to wait on this one and it paid off. The remix of \\"We Belong Together\\" is awesome. Since she hints at the Deele hit \\"Two Occasions\\" in the first version, it's nice she actually includes part of the lyric in this remix! <br /> <br />This platinum edition continues to show how strong the Mimi/J.D. combo really is! <br />Keep on Mimi and THANKS for this reward! <br />
B000002KIE|5.0|England was going through a massive economic depression. There were no jobs to be had and garbage would sit out on corners for weeks. Music was boring and trite just like the people who listened to it. The government didn't care about the working class and acted like nothing was wrong. This was the setting for when the Sex Pistols appeared on the music scene. <br /> <br />Unlike the pop inspired dreck that is marketed as 'punk' these days, the Sex Pistols sang about social problems that were actually happening around them. They themselves grew up in the lower working class and knew what it was like to be poor in a society that wanted to sweep people like them under the rug.  <br /> <br />From what I understand many teens today think the Pistols were 'posuers'. No,kids,they were the real thing,unlike your punk-pop heros who are told by the major labels what to sing about.Punk was originally about being yourself....it wasn't about following the herd. <br /> <br />They inspired The Clash,The Damned and a countless number of bands. This album is essential, and maybe if you listen to it you will be just as inspired.
B00005YW4H|5.0|When she won \\"Album of The Year\\" over Bruce S. and Eminem, I believe, I thought the grammy people have lost their minds. Then, it stayed on the charts for forever. It baffled me how this album is doing so well considering Norah is relatively unknown and it's jazzy, I mean, how good can it be, really? Then, I heard \\"Come Away With Me\\" from some chick movie. Then, not long after I heard \\"The Nearness of You\\" from another movie. I couldn't get those songs out of my head so I finally got the album. Not surprisingly, I never stopped listening to this album for like 2 months. If you don't have this one, I gotta tell you, \\"you're a big fool!\\" I'm not a big fan of jazzy-type vibe songs, but I'm surely a big Norah Jones fan now! She's so refreshing to listen to, rather than these unfortunate pop-py-cheesy-rock-chick-wannabees that claim to be music. Buy this one!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album is fantastic, it really stands out as one the best albums of 2005. A brilliant beat, excellent baseline and rhythm that makes you just want to get up and dance. She is a woman with attitude, an ' I don't give a damn ' attitude to those who who protest to her style with such _in your face_ tunes like ' I love New York ' and ' Like it or Not .' Her style combines a great mix of contemporary retro with strong urban overtones which are reminiscent of 80s inner city NY Life and street culture together with house, Drum N Bass and Dance influences. <br />The more you listen to it, the more it grows on you. Madonna has always been the queeen of pop and this album simply reinstates her position as an icon of the twentieth/twenty-first century.  <br /> <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It is quite unbelievable that Fox network, after viewing the show many times has messed up the timing of the series (Second eps. first, first eps. last), and consequently killed the show because most of the viewers did not have a clue as which is which since the start of the series around year 2002. After a friend has recommanded to me the entire DVD set, I was still being skeptic about the name firefly, it sounded like a low budget sci/fi that did not make it to the big screen, boy was I ever wrong! I not only became a loyal fan and a active messenger for many of mine friends, but I also felt like part of the crew on a lonely cold space journey. Never before was I ever so attatched a TV series. <br />I've been anticipating the movie for quite a while and it is worth every minute; however, certain outcomes from the movie in my opinion will definitely impact the future of the show if there is one. Unless they come up with something very creative like a prequel, or more things they did on their journey before the movie. Although there are a lot of unanswered questions still out there as to what is the true background of the preacher and the outcome of the captain and the companion's relationship etc. Many of the questions surrending the \\"gifted child\\" has been answered which is a big selling point of the show. If Josh Whedon wanted the show to contiune, he wouldn't have answered many of the questions in the movie.  <br />In my opinion, the series premier is a two hour episode which is pretty much like a movie and let's just view the movie as a two hour and half Grand Finale. If there will be future epsodes, I will be very much interested, so will every single person I told about this show.  <br />Peace
B000002G7E|5.0|Originally released in early 1968, the album still blows minds on a regular basis.  Right from the beginning with the wild title track White Light/White Heat to the even wilder 17 minute epic jam that is Sister Ray.  The sound of the recording can be distorted and mucky, but I find that just adds on to the experience.  My two favorite tracks are Sister Ray (as I just mentioned before) and I Heard Her Call My Name.  I Heard Her Call My Name is a blood pumping song with probably the nastiest sounding guitar I've ever heard (so far at least).  The Gift is also a great track, with a hypnotic groove on one speaker and John Cale telling an intriguing and thrilling story on the other speaker.  Here She Comes Now, while being a great song on its own, is probably the weakest song on the album (compared to the power and style of the other songs).  But as in terms of personal and general opinion, I personally love noisy rough music.  If you want to get into Velvet Underground without blowing your ears right off, I suggest taking a listen to Loaded or Velvet Underground & Nico first (though VU & Nico has its moment of chaos as well).  But if you like the rough sound of VU & Nico, get White Light/White Heat immediately.  Most likely, you won't regret it.

B00005JO1S|4.0|Zathura bears a striking similarity to Jumanji.  This is not shocking, considering that both were originally novels written by the same author, Chris Van Allsburg.  The principal difference here is that Zathura is a board game about outer space, and as the two brothers who are at the center of the film begin to play the game, their house ends up in space.   <br /> <br />The strength of this movie is that it depends almost entirely on two young but very talented actors to carry it through its one hour and fifty minute ride.  The two young men are quite engaging, and give convincing depth to the big brother/little brother relationship.  They are joined along the way by an astronaut and their older teenage sister, who has little to do but does just fine doing it.   <br /> <br />The effects work here is nice.  In the CG age, it's hard to note anything as being a standout, but outer space here is vast and beautiful, and the 'destructive' effects are a little scary. <br /> <br />As Zathura reaches its third act, the story bogs down.  There is some sentimentality and predictability, but on the whole there is great fun to be had here.  This movie is ok for kids who are not overly sensitive to frightening images.  Final grade: B
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I really can't find one bad song on this album. It seems like Sufjan borrows from other sources for his music but he keeps it suddle. \\"Concerning the UFO Sighting Near Highland, II\\" reminds me of the K-Pax soundtrack. And in \\"Come On! Feel the Illinoise!\\" starts out sounding like the Peanuts theme song, then goes into sounding like it should be a song in a Broadway Musical, but then if you listen carefully around 2:22 you'll notice that The Cure - \\"Close to Me\\" comes out. And the lyrics are pretty good especially for including Illinois references. I would pick this album up if you found this page through similar artists because you'll most likely be pleased with it. To sum things up I can only say: Its wierd, it works, I like it.
B000002KDX|5.0|One of the top selling debut albums of all time this is my favorite album of all time and has been so for more than 30 years. Sure, I love CSN, CSNY and Neil, but this album really isn't an imitation of those groups, just in the same genre; in my opinion there aren't enough albums in this genre! It's like saying no one else should play music using the electric guitar because Hendrix played it. Wouldn't that just make the selections in music just that much poorer? Face it, CSN and Neil did not invent the acoustic guitar, and though it was their trade mark, they rarely got down in their instrumental parts like this album does (I also rate Homecoming, and at times Hat Trick, as in this genre). To compare early America to them (and vice versa) is a compliment in my book. (I wonder what Neil thought of the first album?) I have owned 8 track, cassettes, 15 or more vinyl LPs (currently have two, including the original British LP without Horse!), 45s (Everyone I Meet Is From California was the flip side of the Horse 45 when it first hit the charts, so I will include it as another favorite tied to, but not on, this album), as well as CDs of this album... and I have never tired of it. For those who own the vinyl and have an adjustable speed turntable try slowing the RPMs down... the album will take on a more haunting sound. Other reviewers have done a good job of reviewing individual songs... my personal favorites from this album are Horse, 3 Roses, Here, and Donkey Jaw. It would definetly be at the top of my list of albums that would go with me to the proverbial deserted island.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I'm not a big madonna fan, and I find myself going back to this album over and over again.

1577311523|2.0|Does Eckhart Tolle really think he is enlightened, and can lead people to that place?  Very, very doubtful.  Good for him, he received some grace when he was in a depressed state, and had a mystical experience - but it's quite a leap to believe this is enlightenment.  His words certainly don't have that ring to it - they are often confused, vague, overly verbose, and smacking of the kind of arrogance which typifies much of modern-day 'spirituality' coming out of the West (e.g., Wilber and Cohen).  I wouldn't be surprised if things changed for Mr Tolle once the stage he is currently in has passed, if he's lucky.  Still, I do think this book contains some good advice, and would probably be an excellent gateway into spiritual realms for 'beginners'.  Just take it with a pinch of salt...

B000002MFN|3.0|Madonna's Erotica has to be her most naughty album to date as she shows her more explicit side. I'd have to say that most of this album had to be inspired by the breathy Justify My Love, as its sexual themes are so spread out all throughout this album.  Erotica, Fever, and Deeper and Deeper are very aggressive dance numbers. I like the reflective ballad Rain on here. But Madonna's at her most outrageous on songs like Thief of Hearts, Bye Bye Baby and Secret Garden, where she's a dominatrix of all sorts.  Most of the writing isn't all that great here as she comes off as cocky and arrogant on most of the steamier songs. When compared to her better albums like Madonna, True Blue, Like A Prayer, Ray of Light, Music, and the just released Confessions of a Dance Floor, this album just doesn't cut it for me. But she does what she wants and most of this album is just not typical of her as an artist.
B00000K3CM|2.0|This was pretty good for elementary school kids, but didn't have much for the adults.  It was a bit dumbed-down with a formula too easy to read.  Did they use some of the same props for this this movie from the first movie?  I thought I detected that.  I found this review had some good points....\\"They tried the same formula but it did not have the charm, warmth, or laughs of the first film. This time they even threw in a homeless woman to try and capitalize on America's fascination and empathy for homeless people. It didn't work. The homeless woman character seemed to be full of all sorts of wisdom and brilliance. She was also some kind of \\"bird lady\\" who fed pigeons in the park and was almost entirely covered by bird feces. Too bad she didn't use her profound sense of wisdom to understand that being covered in bird poop is unhealthy and disgusting.\\" <br /> <br />Caulkin is beguiling and quite a pest...but he is not as good the second time.
B000AGTPUA|5.0|During the holiday season every year Hollywood unleashes a deluge of Christmas movies to capitalize on the season. As a result, a lot of garbage infests the movie screens each November and December. However, once in a while a good Christmas movie comes along. An even more rare occurance is a great Christmas movie finding its way to the screens. That's exactly what we have with Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. This is a film which is destined to become a classic. It will be a holiday favorite loved by generations to come. The story tells of a young boy who has lost his faith in the holiday season, who soon finds himself on a  journey to the North Pole supposedly to see Santa Claus in the flesh.  <br /> <br />Robert Zemeckis, the visionary director and effects wizard behind Back to the Future and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, brings to vivid life the storybook by Chris Van Allsburg. The movie uses cutting-edge computer animation technology to bring the book's images to life with stunning realism. The amazing visuals alone are reason enough to see The Polar Express. It is an astonishing ride that you won't soon forget. However, there's more to it than just stunning visuals. There is heart, emotion and genuine Christmas warmth and spirit. The movie brings to life a magical feeling that no other recent Christmas movie has even come close to. <br /> <br />The cutting-edge \\"motion capture\\" technology used to bring the characters to life results in very realistic human characters the likes of which we aren't used to seeing in an animated film. Some people find it \\"creepy\\", but I could not relate. Perhaps being a lover of horror films and David Lynch and David Cronenberg has desensitized me to said \\"creepiness\\", but I felt only genuine warmth and magic in this film. It's a little bit dark at times, it's not always bright and cheery. It's a little mysterious at first, but I don't see any reason to be creeped out. <br /> <br />The Polar Express is an absolutely wonderful movie.A perfect holiday movie for young or old, it brilliantly captures the excitement and feeling of Christmas like few other movies. With stunning visuals and groundbreaking animation as well as a whole lot of heart and soul, The Polar Express is a ride that no one should miss.

The ONLY problem with this disc is the fact that the pieces are not in the same order as they are in the film, meaning that I'm thinking of one scene one moment, and then all of a sudden, the music from a scene from an hour later comes on.  I really wish they'd arranged the tracks to coincide with those in the film.  Other than that, this is a must-have for anyone who loved the movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I only got to see this show in 2005, because when it originally aired I thought, \\"I don't want to see any Westerns.\\"  But this show is more science-fiction, action, drama, comedy, and actually everything you would want in good TV, then true Western.  I can't believe they aren't making more episodes- they should BRING IT BACK!!!!  I saw the whole series in 2 evenings because it was so good, I didn't want to stop watching.  It does end in a strange place- so many questions unanswered and relationships just begining to develop.  But now there's a movie, so we can find out more about River and hopefully some more characters hook-up(the movie hasn't come out here yet, so I don't know).  They really should make more of this show!  It is truly great story telling and imagination.
B000ANVQ0K|4.0|I was thrilled when I heard that this Special Collector's Edition was being released and that fans would finally have a chance to see all the scenes that had gotten cut from the movie, as well as the alternate ending.  I had heard and/or read about many of the scenes as well as the alternate ending, and had often wondered how they played out on the screen.    While I can see why some of the scenes were cut for time (the scene with Jack & Rose being chased by Cal's gun-toting valet was a bit too long!), some of the scenes definitely should have stayed in the movie, as it fills in the blanks of some questionable scenes (now we know why Rose's hair was up at dinner, yet down when she threatened to jump or who the girl was hanging on the back of the ship next to Rose when Titanic sank - it's Fabrezo's girlfriend Helga!).    I was a bit disappointed that you are unable to view the entire movie with all of the deleted scenes.  Instead of having the movie split onto two discs (this gives the best possible sound/picture, although I honestly didn't see that much of a difference), I would rather have seen the original theatrical release on one disc, with an extended version on the second disc, which included all of the deleted scenes.  Maybe this will be a possible release further down the road.       I also like how you are given the option of viewing the behind-the-scene features \\"branched\\" out from the movie, although it does make viewing the entire movie from beginning to end rather long!    Many people have commented here that they were disappointed that the US was only being given a 3-disc collection, while 4-disc sets were made available overseas.  I too was disappointed about this, until I learned that many of the features from the 4th overseas disc could be found within hidden \\"easter eggs\\" on the US version!    That's right!  The US collection includes the \\"30 Second Recreation with Bunnies\\" (which is hilarious!), the SNL skit with Bill Paxton, James Cameron, CheriOteri, etc., and the MTV skit with Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller & James Cameron.  These features can be found on the 3rd disc (the one with all the deleted scenes). Here's where to look:    30 SECONDS WITH BUNNIES - go to the SPECIAL FEATURES section, then to the STILL GALLERIES, click on the PRODUCTION ARTWORK and highlight SELECT ALL, press the UP arrow and an arrow in the background will light up, press ENTER.    SNL SKIT - Go to the DELETED SCENES selection, go to CHAPTER 29, Highlight the picture of the scene that is shown, then quickly press the RIGHT arrow AND down ARROW (on your remote) and you will see the picture of the couple on the screen get highlighted - press ENTER.    MTV skit w/Ben Stiller & Vince Vaughn - go to the MARKETING section, highlight and click on the newpapers in the lower right-hand corner of the screen (you can also hit \\"5\\" on your remote & ENTER)    This collection is a must-have purchase for any serious fan of the movie. It's also definitely worth the $20 cost just to have a copy in your DVD collection. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is that I would have liked to have had the option of viewing the full movie with all of the deleted scenes included, as well as the HBO special, TV spots & some of the other \\"extras\\" that are included on the oversea versions (perhaps there are additional Easter Eggs that I just haven't found yet that include some of these features!)
B00062J00S|5.0|I've loved to watch \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" for as long as I can remember - and, no matter how many times I've seen it, it always leaves me pondering my own life - wondering what I've contributed to this world & to my loved ones just by the simple fact that I am \\"here\\"...<br /><br />This is one of those movies that tugs at your soul and, as such, it's one to be watched any time of the year - you don't have to wait for the holiday season to watch this one!  In fact, I think it's an awesome movie to watch anytime you're feeling down & depressed - as it reminds us that no matter how bad it gets, our lives do have meaning - that other people DO benefit from our being alive...<br /><br />\\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" is about the life of George Bailey (played by James Stewart) - a man who grew up in a small town where everyone knows everyone.  It takes place on Christmas Eve when, due to his thwarted dreams & a looming scandal, he decides that the only \\"way out\\" is to commit suicide...<br /><br />However, his suicide attempt fails due to some help from an angel (played by Henry Travers) - a very \\"human\\" angel who's trying to \\"earn his wings\\".  This \\"angel\\" decides that the best way to show George that his life DOES have meaning is to show him what life in Bedford Falls (his small town) would have been like if he was never born.  He's taken to the homes of all the people whose lives he touched, and shown where they'd be now if there had never been a \\"George Bailey\\".<br /><br />Through this experience, George finally realizes the amazing, positive impact he really had on these people, and on this town.  At this point, he decides to \\"choose life\\" - it's a beautiful moment!!!<br /><br />Overall, this is a wonderful, touching, important movie.  As I said before, it leads one to ponder the difference they've made in the lives of their loved ones - and even the lives of \\"strangers\\".  Because of this, I would highly recommend this movie to everyone - especially those who may need a reminder now & again that their life truly does have meaning - that they really do make a difference...y need a reminder now & again that their life truly does have meaning - that they really do make a difference...
0684833395|5.0|Is there anything new to say about this American classic?  All of the cliches and superlatives apply.  This is one of the most brilliant and darkly entertaining novels I could imagine, a true masterpiece.  It has been my favorite novel since I was in high school, and it stands up to re-reading very well.  I read it recently and was amazed at how different the experience was from the first time almost 20 years ago.  As a teenager, I was struck most by the comedy.  But now, as a 30-something military veteran and attorney, I focused more on the cynicism.  It wasn't as much fun this time around, but every bit as provocative and interesting.  Overall, a brilliant book that belongs on the universal \\"must read\\" list.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Some of the reviewers on this site are either unintelligent or willfully ignorant. I read through some of the reviews and a common reason for a one star rating was because they did not know the meaning for why the film was created, or what it was about. To these people I would say open your eyes...this film is about addiction. This film shows the lengths to which people will go to satisfy an addiction. It shows how any addiction, no matter how insignificant it may seem, can tear apart a family, a friendship, or even a marriage.  <br /> <br />This film is not a happy go lucky tale with a happy ending, and that is why I think it has made some of you angry. This isn't a movie that you can cuddle up and eat popcorn to, this is a movie that makes you think, makes you bleed with the characters, and makes you examine your own life.  <br /> <br />The primary purpose that I can see for this film is to be a prevention method for anyone considering taking any drug or illegal substance. Watch the movie and see the reality of what can happen...that is what I liked about this movie, it was gritty, dirty, and real. So real, in fact, that I think it might have scared you, made you feel dirty yourselves, and forced you to take a microscope to your own heart.  <br /> <br />The characters spiral out of control, they stumble, and they fail, but in the end you don't see the characters anymore, you see yourself in all your faded glory, exposed to the world, and if that idea scares you then I am sorry.
B00005JM0B|4.0|It's the same old story we have been dying to see again for ten years. The out-dated Terminator-from-the-Future (Aronold Schwarzenegger) has to once again save stubborn, \\"Aw shucks, why me?\\" John Connor (Nick Stahl). Yes, he remembers his mother's admonitions and the dark, dank future awaiting Mankind. Yes, he remembers \\"Hasta la vista, baby.\\" He's hiding in plain sight, roaming the country, staying anonymous. However, a gorgeous new Terminator, T-X (Kristanna Loken), has arrived in L.A. Her mission? Kill John Connor and all his future lieutenants.<br /><br />First thing of note, Arnold looks fabulous. He's pumped back up and whether it's a mannequin impersonating him, a realistic stunt double, or face and body putty, he's somehow erased ten years without looking like a feminized Michael Douglas. This time, the Terminator talks a lot. He's downright chatty. He has to explain what happened in THE TERMINATOR and TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY. Someone also has to explain the dull, convoluted network, Skynet, that will cause the rise of the machines and the takeover of the planet to the audience and update the technical advances of the T-X over the previous T-1000 (Robert Patrick).<br /><br />No star wants to be responsible for \\"exposition,\\" yet screenwriters have not been able to find a good way of bringing back the maligned, but essential, Greek Chorus. This has a way of slowing down the story, especially when you are being hunted by a raging, extreme killing machine with only one purpose. Thankfully, The Terminator only talks while firing a grenade-launcher or carrying a casket.<br /><br />Are we still waiting for Judgment Day?<br /><br />Screenwriters John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris (writers of David Fincher's complex, smart movie The Game, starring the aforementioned Michael Douglas) do not bother refining, or, for that matter, deepening the Terminator bible. That would be like updating The Koran. Instead, we have all the set pieces that are retread, but, who cares? The Terminator arrives naked, gets his leather outfit, and gets the sunglasses. His mission, again, is to save Connor. He's a new Terminator made to resemble the old Terminator, but still an older model. There's no \\"I'm your father\\" twist.<br /><br />It's really not easy to come up with a fresh, compelling stories, and sequels, with already terrific characters created, never seem to outdo the original. Why not start with the Terminator being called to his mission?<br /><br />Connor's reluctant aide is Kate (Claire Danes) who remembers kissing him in junior high school. Their fates were sealed. Danes has an anguished, intelligent face that works well here. What she lacks, and might indeed aspire to, is Sarah Connor's (Linda Hamilton) ferocious determinism and iron will. Perhaps Kate will come into her own in TERMINATOR 4? Stahl's \\"I'm running away from my Savior of Mankind destiny\\" attitude leaves him wallowing around without much sex appeal. Perhaps he will mature and show some Spartan grit in the next one.<br /><br />It's all about the casting and Loken is a fabulous find. She's got one expression and, like Robert Patrick, its \\"pure resolve.\\" Loken is so definitively exact that the beating she takes from Arnold is not gender offensive.<br /><br />Director Jonathan Mostow has a lot of technical dazzle to get up on the screen, so character work and nuisances are secondary here. The action scenes are extreme and spectacular, as T-X, in a mammoth crane, destroys everything in a fifty-mile radius. This is the kind of havoc we, the \\"Shock and Awe Nation,\\" expect.<br /><br />I'm thrilled The Terminator has left behind obeying a boy and taken charge of the future.

0767805712|5.0|I am not going to be write a review like some of the other reviewers have written about this DVD; I try my best to stray away from lengthy reviews that expose too much of the plot. First and foremost, Gattaca is one of the only movies that I can watch again and again without tiring of it. It has characters that will touch your heart, a storyline that will inspire your soul, and the movie itself is beautifully written, and directed. Ethan Hawke plays a wonderful role, as does Jude Law. Jude is rather witty in this movie and will provide a respite, no matter how brief, from the serious plot. The ending is rather sad but is essential for the overall movie to make any sort of sense. My only complaint would be that Uma Thurman's character was not given more diologue and screentime. This truly is a wonderful film.
B00004TRD8|5.0|In reviewer Ronald Thomson's DVDTown critique of the previous release of \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day,\\" he called it \\"a landmark film in special effects development.\\" True, and Artisan's \\"Ultimate Edition DVD\\" establishes yet another benchmark, the first DVD to utilize the medium's full potential--over six hours of material on a single dual-layered, dual-sided disc. It's what director James Cameron was said to have wanted with \\"Titanic.\\" Now, he gets his way. The disc contains two versions of the movie, the primary theatrical release and a special, extended version, plus over forty special features. I'm not entirely sure I agree with Ronald's assessment of the film's having an entertainment value of 10, but I'm willing to concede the point in its \\"Ultimate Edition\\" trappings. I certainly concur with everything else Ronald said, especially that \\"Terminator 2\\" belongs in any sci-fi collection. Now, before I comment on the special bonus items, here's more of what Ronald said about the movie itself...the first DVD to utilize the medium's full potential--over six hours of material on a single dual-layered, dual-sided disc.<br /><br />\\"The first terminator failed to change history. It's up to a second terminator to terminate John Conner in his youth years after the attempt to kill his mother. Granted, just another cyborg won't do. The terminator sent back to change history has the ability to emulate any non-mechanical object it comes in contact with, but Arnold Schwarzenegger is up to the task of saving the world, even against an indestructible, morphing adversary in this terminator-on-terminator battle.<br /><br />Thanks to the marvels of time travel, John Conner was raised believing that the world would be devastated and he would lead the rebellion against the machines. His mother, however, was committed for being delusional. After all, how could machines take over the world? Now, two terminators show up, and he realizes that his mother was right.\\"<br /><br />Video & Audio:<br />The audio and video for the movie are fine. Definitely high quality. The sound and anamorphic picture are THX certified, but more important, the detail in sound staging is excellent. For instance, in one of the opening scenes, a motorcycle drives by on the road, and the audio definitely tracks with the location of the bike, even though it's a simple background noise. Amazing battles, fights, explosions, gun shots, and chase scenes leave the viewer enjoying the movie, not just admiring its technical perfection. The picture is slightly light, overall, and perhaps a tad soft. I would have liked a greater color depth.<br /><br />More from Thomson: \\"'T2' is not perfect, the acting leaving much to be desired. But then, so is the acting in \\"Star Wars\\" imperfect. In both cases, however, the acting does not detract from the movies' overall effectiveness, presentation, or entertainment value.\\"<br /><br />Extras:<br />Thanks, Ronald, now let's hit those new bonus features, starting with side one, which is labeled \\"Side A\\" in print so small you have to hold it to the light and squint to read it. This is the main side, and the first thing you'll notice when it starts up is the snazzy new interface. The animated menu design looks like the inside of a robotics factory for terminator cyborgs. However, while it's beautiful to look at, it presents some problems getting around. A warning comes with the package (which is housed, by the way, in a handsome brushed-aluminum casing) stating that \\"due to the advanced features utilized in the creation of this DVD, some players may experience minor navigational difficulties.\\" My Sony 7700 player had no technical difficulty navigating the menus, but I had trouble finding everything I needed to. Some of the directional arrows are so dark and so tiny, they can be hard to spot, and they are often not located with the rest of the items on a screen. It also took me a moment to locate the THX tests advertised on the box. They're in the audio section and indicated by a little \\"THX\\" sign on the skeletal metal head to the left of the main audio choices. Once you find these tests, though, which are about the same as those found on the \\"Fight Club\\" DVD and basically duplicate the tests on most standard DVD setup discs like \\"Video Essentials,\\" you'll find them handy to use. They include checks for color calibration, brightness, convergence, channel balance, channel-phase polarity, subwoofer integration, and other such criteria for optimizing a home theater.<br /><br />Now, you're almost ready to choose which version of the movie you want to watch. The first is the regular theatrical release at 136 minutes; the other is the special edition with sixteen minutes of additional material. Some of this extra stuff is in bits and pieces scattered about; and some of it is contained in completely new scenes, raising the chapter index to an astounding eighty selections, maybe a record of its kind, an index point for about every two minutes of screen time! If you have already seen the film, and who hasn't, I advise watching the special edition; it's one of the few instances where the added material makes sense and isn't just included as a gimmick. But the chapter selections menu is no longer animated as it was in the previous disc. I suppose some things had to go, and it's a miracle the engineers were able to cram as much as they did on both sides of one disc. Anyway, the side also contains four different audio tracks: one in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround EX, another in DTS 5.1 ES, a third in Dolby Surround 2.0, and a final one featuring commentary by members of the cast and crew. English is the only spoken language option, but subtitles are provided in English for the hearing impaired. There are also extensive cast and crew biographies and filmographies, plus some DVD-ROM items. The keep case claims that the film was newly remastered in THX, but as far as I could tell in comparing it to its prior DVD incarnation, the picture and sound quality appear the same, with the anamorphic screen ratio an identical 2.17:1. Perhaps Artisan meant that the film was newly remastered for DVD previously. In any case, the picture and sound are still as good as could be hoped for and deserving of the highest rating that could be assigned them.<br /><br />Side two (B) is where you'll find most of the bonus materials. Again, navigation may be an initial problem, but once you think you get the hang of it, it becomes no easier. Here, in various categories, you will discover more than you could ever want to know about the film, its history, and its production. One of the subdivisions is called \\"Information Programs,\\" and it includes the disc's three main documentaries. The first is a thirty-minute promo titled \\"The Making of T2,\\" produced at the time of the film's shooting in 1991. You'll see interviews with the stars and crew and various behind-the-scenes looks at the techniques used in the filmmaking. The second, twenty-two-minute, featurette, made in 1993 for the Showtime cable channel and titled \\"T2: More Than Meets the Eye,\\" is even more interesting. It deals with the longer version of the movie and explains why certain scenes had to be cut for the original theatrical release and why they were filmed in the first place. The third documentary, the twenty-three-minute \\"Making of Terminator 2 3D: Breaking the Screen Barrier,\\" is all about the creation of the MCA/Universal Studios theme park attraction and hints that the attraction may be a stepping stone to a possible third theatrical feature. We'll see.<br /><br />Another subdivision on side two is called \\"Visual Campaigns.\\" It includes four trailers, three in partial widescreen and one in pan-and-scan, and five Japanese teasers. Then there's a third subdivision, called \\"Data Hub,\\" which has even more information. To begin with, it contains the complete shooting script of the film in 574 text frames. Placing the written text over a flaming red-and-orange backdrop, though, was a questionable decision. I didn't read the entire script, only the first few pages, but had I tried, I probably would have needed new glasses by now. (The DVD-ROM portion of the disc allows one to read the script while looking at many of the storyboards.) Next, there are what appear to be hundreds of regular storyboard sequences and archives. Tons and tons of archival stuff. In fact, there are sixty separate video selections, each individually indexed, probing the filmmaking process with cast and crew. Of these, I was particularly taken with the segments using multi-angle shots, the Terminator saying \\"I'll be back\\" in a variety of languages, and the sequence demonstrating the video transfer of \\"T2\\" for separate letterbox and pan-and-scan versions taken from the same Super-35 negative. And in yet another section, \\"Data Core,\\" you'll find fifty more chapters worth of supplemental items. Somewhere buried in all of these hours of bonus goods, there is supposed to be an article titled \\"Battle Across Three Dimensions\\" by Estelle Shay, but try as I might, I honestly couldn't find it. Next, if you have the patience, wait twenty seconds or so for a static menu screen to come to life and then click on it; you will be rewarded by a link to a not-so-hidden Web site. Finally, a thirty-two-page informational booklet insert may also set a record of sorts. You'll be exploring for weeks.<br /><br />Parting Thoughts:<br />Without question, \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day,\\" the Ultimate Edition DVD, is well named. It is a milestone in the evolution of the DVD medium for its ability to carry huge quantities of information into the home.

0739308742|2.0|A Feast for Crows is the fourth installment in George R.R. Martin's sweeping fantasy epic A Song of Ice and Fire. It picks up where the last installment (A Storm of Swords) left off, without skipping a beat. Like the previous tomes, it features what we have come to expect: interweaving subplots, political intrigue aplenty and some new point of view surprises.  <br /> <br />All of us following the series have waited 5 years for this release. In those five years I discovered audio books and mp3 players. I bought the first 3 books and rediscovered the series.  <br /> <br />The first 3 audio books are read by British stage actor Roy Dotrice. Dotrice's strong, deep voice is wonderfully suited to this material His reading is entertaining, with an air of authority, throughout the imposing 150 hours of the 3 unabridged books.  <br /> <br />Sadly, he is not the reader for A Feast for Crows. The new reader, John Lee does not have the air of gravitas that the work deserves. His narrative is thin and overly dramatic, as if he believes he is reading a children's book. His characters, male and female, young or old are indistinguishable.  <br /> <br />Due to a conflict of schedules, Random House Audio decided not to wait for Dotrice so that the audio book could be available at the same time as the hardcover book's release. Unfortunately for us, commerce once again takes a toll on art.  <br /> <br />The change of lead is not unlike going from Sean Connery to George Lazenby. Random House Audio should take a page from MGM and go back to Roy Dotrice for the next audio book A Dance with Dragons.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|The worldwide success of Christopher Nolan's \\"Batman Begins\\" has prompted Warner Bros. to finally release Tim Burton's 1989 \\"Batman\\" with an extra disc of special features...and this is an event worth cheering about!<br /><br />A groundbreaking cinematic achievement (and one of the most expensive films ever produced, to that time), \\"Batman\\" was a tremendous gamble, and the story behind the ten-year struggle to bring it to the screen is fascinating! It is a tale of visionaries, beginning with Michael Uslan, a young student/Batman fan, who not only convinced his university to include comics in their curriculum, but, fired up by Richard Donner's \\"Superman\\", knew a Batman film could be just as powerful, and took the idea, with Batman creator Bob Kane's blessing, to Hollywood; of Peter Gruber and Jon Peters, who listened to Uslan, after every studio had passed on it, saw the potential, and decided to gamble; of Sam Hamm, who had a \\"Batman\\" script in his head, praying to get the chance to write it; and, most importantly, of Tim Burton, whose dark, quirky sensibilities made him THE director to film it, despite only two feature films to his credit.<br /><br />This remarkable story, with archival footage and new interviews, is the highlight of disc two, but there is much, much more! Did you know that Robin was scripted to make an appearance in the first film? That Sean Young, not Kim Basinger, had been cast as Vicki Vale? That the Batmobile, designed by Oscar-winner Anton Furst, could actually do 95 mph (and that Tim Burton drove it, once?) That the room where disfigured Jack Nicholson received his unsuccessful plastic surgery was actually a studio prop room? Each chapter is a revelation!<br /><br />Not that there aren't a few disappointments in the presentation; there is no chapter with deleted scenes (although a few moments are shown that never made it into the finished film...a little girl, seeing Batman, asks, in all seriousness, \\"Is it Halloween?\\", which causes him to pause, and grin); the 'History' of Batman, despite a wealth of photos and clips from the comics, serials, and graphic novels, does not offer a single visual from the campy 60s TV series (whether this was a refusal by 20th Century Fox, who produced the series, to permit their use, or an attempt to distance the movie from the \\"ZAP!

Also, the brief appearance of screen legend Jack Palance, as 'Boss Grissom', is largely ignored, other than in Tim Burton's audio commentary, which is surprising.

B000AL730O|4.0|This has to be one of the best albums of 2005 for an \\"old rocker.\\" Chaos and Creation in the Backyard really grows on you after a few listens. The booklet is rather cheap, but at least the sound quality and musicianship is solid. Little stronger than the new Stones or Clapton discs. But, also out is Deep Purple's \\"Rapture of the Deep,\\" which is not only vintage Purple, it's modern day classic rock. The press and long time fans are calling this one a Purple masterpiece. I agree!<br /><br />Bravo Sir Paul and Deep Purple!
B0007GAERG|1.0|This is one of the worst cd releases I have ever seen. There is only one good song on this thing and that is \\"We Belong Together.\\" Buy the single if you must, but the album STINKS!    Her voice sounds weak and scratchy. She still resorts to the lame guest rappers. She spends too much time breathing and gasping for air and not enough time singing.    One good song doesn't make a good album.    I recommend Madonna's new cd \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" instead. That album is good all the way through. It also has NO guest rappers!
B0007ZEO4G|5.0|It was recorded in late 1973, with Ritchie Blackmore (guitar), Jon Lord (keyboards) and Ian Paice (drums) plus new members, David Coverdale (vocals) and Glenn Hughes (bass guitar and vocals). The band were really on their best behavior here and resulted in a great album that is more blues and soul than their previous albums. Blackmore is pretty much the star on BURN, leading the band with some killer riffs and playing some terrific solos.<br /><br />Jon Lord is more colorful than usual, using more than just the organ and piano. The bass and especially the drums do a great job that can impress anyone. Ian Paice never gets his due for being a top-notch drummer, and he shines on this disc. The vocals are not Ian Gillan, but are still very good. Actually, I see this album as the ultimate tribute to Gillan, by replacing him with not one, but two singers, trading off vocals on all the songs but Mistreated (Coverdale solo) and A200 (the closing instrumental). What is nice about this disc is that it's not a bunch of cheesy songs going for a hit single, but it plays from start to finish with a sense of intellectual capacity. It's heavy, it rocks, it's bluesy. What a GREAT rock album!<br /><br />Burn - The title track is a classic masterpiece.<br />Might Just Take Your Life - Unadulterated Deep Purple excellence.<br />Lay Down, Stay Down - Another good song with great Blackmore solos.<br />Sail Away - A tour de force among masterpieces. This should be an FM staple.<br />You Fool No One - Lots of percussion. One of my DP favorites.<br />What's Going on Here - Some silly lyrics but another excellent rocker.<br />Mistreated - Besides the title track, this is the other classic from Burn.<br />A 200 - A cool way to end the album, a quirky instrumental.<br />The rest of this CD features remixes, starting with a rare B-side (a better mix than the original) and four songs from the main album (Burn, Mistreated, You Fool No One and Sail Away.) These remixes work very well (more bottom/less cymbal brightness). With a few surprises for the long time fan, such as the extended ending to You Fool No One. The booklet is also up to the high standards of the previous anniversary collections.<br /><br />RATING: 4 3/4 starsrprises for the long time fan, such as the extended ending to You Fool No One. The booklet is also up to the high standards of the previous anniversary collections.     RATING: 4 3/4 stars
B000BO0LKY|1.0|Mariah used to be a great singer. Now her voice is grainy and hoarse. She sounds like she's gasping for air. The only good song on here is \\"We Belong Together.\\" Just buy the single and buy something else! <br /> <br />Also...How many times is she going to re-release this crappy album? Her sales are suspicious because her dumb fans have bought it every time she's re-done the tracklisting! Can it even be considered the same album if the tracklisting is different? It's almost as bad as her 49 cent single scandal from a few years back. Her singles only went to number one because she practically gave them away. Other artists sold their singles for 3 dollars! <br /> <br />I would recommend buying Madonna's \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" instead of this. Every song on the Madonna album is good. It's a great dance album. This one is just one good single with the rest all filler. Her voice used to be better than Madonna's, but now I'd have to say Madonna even has the better voice of the two. I guess smoking and singing don't mix!
B000005RRP|5.0|If you like Deep Purple but don't own Fireball, you are in for a real treat. This album is a hard rock masterpiece and Ian Gillan would totally agree with me. It's a shame that Fireball has been kind of forgotten about, it clearly holds up against In Rock. If you're just starting to collect their albums, maybe you already have Machine Head, this one won't disappoint you. It is one of the great rock albums of the seventies.<br /><br />The highlights: Fireball, Strange Kind of Woman, Anyone's Daughter, Fools, No One Came, Demon's Eye, I'm Alone and Freedom.<br /><br />PS: Check out their 2005 album, Rapture of the Deep. It holds up well. I would say it is right up there with their classic material.
B000BGR0OM|2.0|What a wasted opportunity to update their Greatest Hits CD. They missed (again) the single Beethoven (I Love To Listen To) and missed (this time, not in the first Greatest Hits CD) the song \\"Don't ask my why\\" which certainly it's a crime. Nobody can get a complete picture of Eurythmics style and hits without those 2 songs, specially \\"Don't ask my why\\". This CD is advisable as a complement to their first greatest hits CD, but if you are looking for your first Eurythmics CD and don't want to buy any of their albums, you will be better off buying their first Greatest Hits CD, not this one.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Freedom, beauty, truth and love.  Freedom from obeying the limitations of \\"usual\\" execution of film.  The beautiful experience of the movie lies in its telling of a story championing love as the final truth of life.  This is an unaffected and charming performance that everyone must experience. A good portion of viewers will probably prefer the usual script as their source of distraction from their own scripted life.  For those who do not want to walk the designated route of life, this is your movie.  Freedom, beauty, truth and love are only cliched for those who are assimilated by the visual language of consumerism.  If you watch this movie and do not enjoy it, then evaluate your standards and see how deeply affected you probably are by the mass media crammed into your psyche.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|To those of you who love R'n'B \\"The Emancipation Of Mimi\\" is a must buy this year. The Platinum Edition does not only include the no. 1 single \\"We belong together\\" as well as the smash-hits \\"It's like that\\" and \\"Shake it off\\" but also 4 previously unreleased tracks including Mariah's new U.S. single \\"Don't forget about us\\", \\"Makin' it last all night (What it look like)\\", \\"So lonely\\" a collaboration with Twista and the DJ Clue Remix of \\"We belong together\\" (formerly only available as digital download) which perfectionize an already great album! This album is a perfect symbiosis of heart-rending ballads and hot dancing tracks sung by a woman with an outstanding voice which cannot be ignored!!!    As if this wasn't enough this version of \\"The Emancipation Of Mimi\\" goes with a dvd containing the music videos to \\"It's like that\\", \\"We belong together\\", \\"Shake it off\\" and \\"Get your number\\". Last the buyer is offered access to Mariah's newest video to \\"Don't forget about us\\" and a never before seen interview \\"Mariah Carey: In her own words\\" which make this version definitely even worth another buy!
B000CC4GEW|5.0|I was delighted to find this movie in DVD format.It is without a doubt one of the greatest War Films ever made! This import was a great buy and its sound and image quality are excellent. <br />This film depicts one of the greatest military victories in British history and, for the French, one of the most disastrous. The Battle of Waterloo puts an end to Napoleon Bonaparte's impressive career of invasions and occupations in Europe. A Great DVD to Own.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|My wife is a big Firefly fan. Not being a tv watcher or any kind of \\"evangelist\\" personality, I just never took the time to watch it.  As a present, I took her to see the special exclusive pre-release screening.<br /><br />The movie blew me away..seriously. It wasn't perfect..what movie is? But sitting here now, I couldn't list those imperfections.  What sticks with you is the epic story line, the powerful character archetypes, the feeling of continuity between the characters.  I didn't know anything about the series before I saw it, and I didn't need to in order to get caught up in the story line.<br /><br />Within a week after seeing it, I saw the entire TV series I'd missed on DVD. Then I went and saw the movie again. Some things were more clear, and some things were more poignant, but I think the movie was great the first time around, too.  I've already pre-ordered the DVD.  I guess you could call me a convert.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|<br />Well for all dance music lovers, and im a musician and produce electronic music,, this album is indeed an all time HIT.. <br />The analog sounds and arranging of the album is great. <br />Each song has meaningfull lyrics,, one of my favorite tracks are <br />Sorry, Forbbiden love a great synth line in this song, and ISAAC <br />Isaac track takes to another world,  <br /> <br />This album brings you back to the electro dance sound like the pet shop boys etc.. Great Album and a bow to MADONNA and to Stuart Price.. <br /> <br />Cheers <br />Adele
B0007O38F8|4.0|I am 52 years old and I like several of the cuts on this CD.  Candy Shop is my favorite, even though if you really listen to the lyrics you should be red-faced!  But it is the tune that I like.  I bought the new release which has the DVD in it, which I think helps to make it worth the price you pay.  My boyfriend who is 47 was watching it and made note to the fact that some women would do ANYTHING to be in a music video and he is right.  I tried to be objective but I couldn' <br />t watch all of it...it was just too much, but I am sure it would appeal to a more open-minded younger crowd.  I don't regret spending my $$ on it and I guess that' the best thing I can say
B000BGH22W|1.0|This soundtrack was by far the worst of the Harry potter movies.   First off I realize that you can't keep all of the original music, but at least keep the theme of the movies. \\"Death of Cedric\\" would have been much better if they had used the original theme. Overall I am ashamed of this soundtrack, as it is an insult to the Harry potter franchise
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I just wanted to share my enthusiasm for this wonderful BBC adaptation.  I'm a fan of classic literature, particularly 19th century English literature.  I read and absolutely loved \\"North and South\\" by Elizabeth Gaskell, and was excited when I saw the DVD would be made available in the US.  I just got my pre-ordered copy a couple days ago, and all I can say is that it was AMAZING.  I've watched and loved many other BBC adaptations, including the beloved \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and Gaskell's own \\"Wives and Daughters.\\"  \\"North and South,\\" however, is my absolute favorite. <br /> <br />What's so great about it is that it accurately depicts middle and working class life in the Victorian era.  So many other adaptations made the time period seem to consist entirely of morning calls, dinner parties, and balls.  \\"North and South,\\" however, shows the daily struggles and class differences.  You keenly feel the pain and pleasure of every character, however minor. <br /> <br />And of course, what's truly wonderful is watching the progression of the love story between Margaret Hale and John Thronton.  The Margaret from my reading of the novel was different in my head, so Daniella Denby-Ashe took a little getting used to.  But by then end I thought she was wonderful.  Richard Armitrage, however, was wonderful as Thornton.  His acting was so nuanced that you could read his feelings from his facial expressions.  I loved how he got a lot of screen time compared to the male characters in other adaptations/novels.  Each scene showing the interaction between Thornton and Margaret was perfectly played out.  So many favorite scenes!  Though in particular I thought the part where he sees Margaret and her brother at the station, then the whole resulting police investigation and  Thornton and Margaret's first interaction after that was really good.  Behind his hurt pride and outward cold demeanor, you could see the pain and hidden love in his eyes.  Also noteworthy is the scene where Margaretis leaving Milton, and Thornton is watching the departing carriage saying \\"look back at me.\\"  I could go on and on... <br /> <br />Initially I was disappointed that a few of my favorite scenes from the novel were not included (such as Thornton laying Margaret on the sofa after the riot scene, here's quoting from the novel: <br /> <br />\\"He bore her into the dining-room, and laid her on the sofa  <br />there; laid her down softly, and looking on her pure white face,  <br />the sense of what she was to him came upon him so keenly that he  <br />spoke it out in his pain: <br /> <br />'Oh, my Margaret--my Margaret! no one can tell what you are to <br />me! Dead--cold as you lie there, you are the only woman I ever <br />loved! Oh, Margaret--Margaret!' Inarticulately as he spoke, <br />kneeling by her, and rather moaning than saying the words, he <br />started up, ashamed of himself, as his mother came in. She saw <br />nothing, but her son a little paler, a little sterner than usual.\\" <br /> <br />though obviously she was not dead only unconscious.  A lot of things were also changed (such as Henry Lennox's character, the whole situation under which Thorton and Margaret first met, the addition of the character Anne Latimer, etc), but the spirit of the book remained and the changes make sense for the purposes of the screen adaptation.  In fact, much of the added dialogue is true to what Gaskell herself might have written, such as Margaret writing to Edith about the cotton mills \\"I believe I've seen hell, and it is white, snow white.\\" <br /> <br />Basically, I strongly recommend you get both the DVD and the book.  Don't get discouraged by the slow start to the novel, it's worth sticking to.  BTW, the theme music on the DVD was perfect as well.  Enjoy!

B000001Y79|4.0|Some of you kids out there are not familiar with NO DOUBT. Its hard to believe, even you kids who are fans of the most recent GWEN STEFANI record, have no clue. At least not this album, which, is easy for me to say, the best record of her career.<br /><br />Ten years now, its been since this one got released, and man, did they stir up some pop radio waves. JUST A GIRL hit radios hard in late '95 early '96, when pop culture was undergoing serious changes. Rock and marijuana hip hop were on top still, but sugar pop and boy bands were coming up the ranks (we had no idea.) This song was very crazy sounding, a mix of ska, punk and pop. It was completley unique, and this is when most of us were introduced to that blonde firecracker, GWEN STEFANI. Sure she's still bangin', for sure, but back then this chick was part of the rock world, and was surely putting a young Wally Gator into a frenzy of hormonal insanity. I purchased this disc in 1996, and really enjoyed it. SPIDERWEBS is another song that rocks the pop envelope to the hilt. The rest of this album is well written and much more stripped than anything else that would follow. If you have never heard this gem and are a fan of GWEN you outta check it out, it will blow you away. The sound and feel of this album has never been matched by anyone, even that sweet chick who wrote it.
B000BGH22W|1.0|I am sorry to disagree with you all, but I HATED IT!!! The music didn't flow with the movie at all. In fact the movie itself didn't flow. I have nothing against Patrick Doyle, but I think I would have liked the movie alot more if John Williams had done the music. I know composers sometimes need a break when doing films like these, but in my opinion, If you do the first 3 movies, you must be commited and do all the movies.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|This film does not follow Homer's Iliad closely but the cinematography of this movie is excellent. Although most of the storyline in this movie is a myth, this film is an epic. The special effects are great and the acting is satisfactory. Brad Pitt's casting as Achilles is the right move by the director of this film. Pitt fills in the role superbly and this brings out the 'X' factor of this movie. A MUST see for all fans of ancient Greece.

B00008EY9G|3.0|I truly enjoyed director James Mangold's \\"Cop Land\\" and was looking forward to spinning this one on DVD - \\"Identity\\" has one of the best ensemble casts assembled in recent years and gets off to a great start.<br /><br />But then it all comes apart, and the script just gets way too smart, toying with the audience as if the scriptwriter was thumbing his nose at the viewers and saying: \\"Hey I AM smarter than you.\\"<br /><br />And I hate it when people do something like that. I am all for twists in films - some the greatest films of all time are built around such a premise, including \\"The Third Man\\", \\"Sixth Sense\\" and \\"Rashomon\\". But \\"Identity\\" ends up being too smart for its own good and the twist really leads to a unfulfilling conclusion.<br /><br />But \\"Identity\\" also has lots to recommend it - the great cast, Mangold's terrific pacing and the nice chills that come along at a clip in the first two-thirds of the movie.<br /><br />The story? Well, one dark rainy night, a bunch of characters get stuck in a motel in Nevada that could give the Bates Motel from \\"Psycho\\" a run for its money. There's the limo driver (John Cusack) transporting a movie star (Rebecca DeMornay), a young couple that just got married in Las Vegas, a prostitute (Amanda Peet) who's heading back home to make a fresh start, and a cop (Ray Liotta) escorting a nasty convicted murderer (Jake Busey).<br /><br />But when the cast starts getting killed off one by one, tensions flare up and a desperate hunt begins for the killer.<br /><br />At the same time, all of this is somehow tied in to a psychiatrist (Alfredo Molina) in a faraway city trying to prove that a serial killer (Pruitt Taylor Vince) is insane so that his execution - slated for the next morning - can be stayed.<br /><br />Just how are these two situations connected? Well, you'll have to watch \\"Identity\\" to find that out!!<br /><br />This one's a nice ride, but when you do reach the destination, you only end up feeling like you've been taken for a ride.'ve been taken for a ride.
B000002JSN|5.0|the other day i would of given this album two stars and said it was pretentious but after another listen i found myself enjoying this album so much i played it three times that night it's a damn  hard rock classic yeah some of there songs are a tad too long but they rock man they really rock  <br />features my favorites \\"custurd pie, houses of the holy, trampled under foot, and boogie with stu,  <br />robert plant is on top form with his wail and lyrics yeah they may sound naive but they're singable  <br />and page is the monster riff where his hands can go up and down the fretboard like a ferret with a rocket up it's ass  <br />and paul jones the entwistle of led zeppelin plays with great power and of course not forgetting the late great drummer the one and only john bonham who drives the band just like keith moon did for the who,  <br />john bonham was a mad man and a fantastic drummer  <br />great album from a great band LED ZEPPELIN
B0002OERI0|3.0|Green Day <br />American Idiot <br />3.5 Stars <br /> <br />Green Day, oh how you confuse me. <br /> <br />There's really no way I can describe these guys. They make above average music (meaning better music than the other stuff you will hear on the radio), get more attention than they deserve, and dress like rejects from Good Charlotte. I'm not a guy to obsess over image, but come on, in the pop-punk world I would distance myself as far away from those guys as possible. <br /> <br />As for the music, well, it's good, not great, but good. It's overplayed. I mean really overplayed. The biggest problem being that they can play it on nearly every type of radio station, the pop stations, the alternative stations, I've even heard Boulevard played on the Classic Rock station before. Had this CD not been a radio sensation I think a lot of the nay-sayers would be proclaiming it as the salvation of rock music, instead it goes under my \\"Good, but if I hear that song one more time I'm going to shoot someone.\\" catagory. The last time I heard a song as overplayed as Boulevard was when my little sister got ahold of Adam's Song by Blink 182. Seriously, take it off repeat kids. <br /> <br />But I'm not bashing the music. I'd rather have the kids listening to music that has a message other than the big booty hoes crap I hear out at the clubs. Sure the message is a little too angsty, and (in my opinion) a step backwards from the sarcastic, \\"We don't care,\\" attitude of the Green Day of old. But hey, it's still pretty good. <br /> <br />What I'm getting at is, while this CD appeals to about everything a rebellious young teen could look for in music, in every catagory it fits under there's a better band. You want rebellious rock, go get Evil Empire by Rage Against The Machine. You want sappy rock ballads, go get a Tesla or Boston CD (or a million other bands). You want punk music, buy a Bad Religion CD (they might also fit your need for a political messege). Even if you just want to hear Green Day, I'd suggest one of their older Cd's. But if you want all of that rolled into one, in a CD that nearly everyone will enjoy, look to American Idiot. It won't renew your hope in rock and roll, it's not going to start some political revolution, but it is a good listen. <br /> <br />As for me, my copy is going to go up in my closet and when I go a full month without hearing one of the songs on the radio, only then will I take it out, and give it the listen it deserves.
B000B0WODA|5.0|Sounding like a cross between The Beatles and Jet, this is one rockin album! Not on the high pedestal of The Beatles (similarities though), and on a higher one than Jet, I think this Scottish foursome (how Beatles'eque) is the best thing that's happened to rock in quite a while.  Go Europe.
0060523794|4.0|Its an amazing corporate turnaround story written in a most simplified and honest manner. I read this book after reading Fortune cover story on IBM's current CEO Palmisano.

B000002OR4|5.0|Schindler's List is one of the best scores ever composed. It is dark, violent, innocent, sweet, emotional, and epic. It is a soundtrack that is better described as an emotional journey through your own heart and soul. <br /> <br />Quite simply put, this is a must have.
0609610570|4.0|We all know the importance of getting things done. But there is a thin (and sometimes not clear) line between micro management and executing critical things. The book addresses many such issues and has given a clear road map of \\"execution\\".  <br /> <br />The case-study of EDS is also very interesting and relevant to lot of organizations.  <br /> <br />After reading the book, you can figure out the difference between a good company and a great company....and no guess it is leader's ability to execute.
0060930187|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this book. I liked the precision of Plath's writing, and parts of the book were excellent. But it is so detatched, and there is so little character development or background story, so I found myself just not caring much for Esther Greenwood (the protagonist), nor really understanding the reasons for her inner torment.<br /><br />There are a few scenes where we get a glimpse of her childhood and some of the issues she had to deal with. But these glimpses are brief and fleeting, and left me wanting much more. For the most part, I found Esther to be remote, self-obsessed, and not very likeable, which left me indifferent to her plight.<br /><br />Mostly, I was frustrated at Esther's unwillingness to cooperate with those who are trying to help or, or her unwillingless to  help herself. She wants to wallow in her misery. So wallow she does. And because she feels that everyone else is the cause of her problems, she makes no effort to look inward.<br /><br />If Esther is a thinly disguised Plath, it is no surprise Plath's life ended with suicide. It seems inevitable. Esther is hell-bent on failure, in spite of the best efforts of those around her.<br /><br />I'm glad I read The Bell Jar for the simple reason that it feels like an authentic and honest depiction of a young person's descent into mental illness. Depression affects millions of people. It's an important issue that needs to be explored and understood. And Plath does a fair (but incomplete) job of it. I only wish I liked the Esther more. I found myself not caring very much about her fate. Neither, apparently, did she.
B0000648WZ|5.0|+++++<br /><br />This movie is based on Robert Heinlein's 1959 classic science fiction novel of the same name.<br /><br />The movie begins with an advertisement from the \\"Federal [Military] Network\\" where young people are encouraged to join the military \\"to become a citizen.\\" (A citizen as opposed to a civilian is a military person.)  We are also shown how the Earth can defend itself against \\"the arachnoid [or bug] threat.\\"  (Yes, the aliens threatening to destroy Earth in this futuristic sci-fi movie are giant bugs and they live on a bug planet.)<br /><br />Then the story switches to the four young people who have made the decision to join the military during peacetime:  (1) Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien), (2) Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards, the ex-Mrs. Charlie Sheen), (3)  Dizzy  \\"Diz\\" Flores (Dina Meyer), and (4) Carl Jenkins (Neil Patrick Harris).  Johnny's decision is heavily based on what Jean Rasczak (Michael Ironside) tells him.<br /><br />Eventually full-scale war with the bugs ensues.  During this part of the movie (which mainly follows the exploits of Johnny) there are intense, graphic action sequences (thus this movie is definitely not for children).  The special effects are spectacular as well.<br /><br />If this movie was only about what I said above, I certainly would not give it the rating I did.  But the movie is more.  It is actually a not-so-obvious, comical satire of fascist propaganda with an emphasis against military conformity and a warning of the sickening realities of war.  (Fascism is a system of government characterized by one-party dictatorship, private economic enterprise under central government control, racism, militarism, etc.)  However, like I said, this is not obvious and I suspect that many people will only see this movie as humans fighting giant bugs.  (In fact, this would explain the one- and two-star ratings below this one as these people saw the movie on its most obvious level.)  You have to watch this movie carefully and not let the dazzling effects distract you.<br /><br />All the actors, contrary to what other reviewers say below, do a good job in their roles especially with respect to the comical aspects of this movie.  (I suspect that there were many retakes as some of the actors probably cracked up laughing.)  I have to give special kudos to Michael Ironside as the determined Lieutenant Rasczak for an exceptional fine acting job.

0740748475|5.0|Jameson Thottam  Sideseat review of Calvin and Hobbes <br /> <br />Jameson L Thottam - Intro Overview <br />Anyone who read comics strips in the 80's and 90's has one strip that always brings a smile to their face - Calvin and Hobbes. Now, the entire too short run of this classic is collected in one classy set.  <br /> <br />Jameson James Thottam: For those unfamiliar <br />For those not familiar, Calvin is a six year old boy growing up in a house with his parents. His best friend is his stuffed tiger, Hobbes, who happens to be real, but only to Calvin. Together, the two get into all kinds of scraps, mainly because Calvin is the poster child for obnoxious kids. The fact that his parents haven't strangled him is a major miracle.  <br /> <br />Jameson Thottam: A Treat for the eyes & mind <br />For the reader, this is a wonderful treat, because it means we get to watch Calvin in one adventure after another refusing to learn anything. And his imagination makes those adventures far out. He might be Spaceman Spiff, battling the evil Zorg who want to torture him by sending him to school. He might create a duplicator and create duplicates of himself to ease his homework load. He might don his Stupendous Man costume to fight his nemesis Babysitter Fiend. Or he might use his time machine to travel forward in time to get his completed homework from his future self. And don't forget a nice round of Calvinball. Or a meeting of the top secret club GROSS (Get Rid Of Slimy girlS).  <br /> <br />Jameson Luke Thottam: Creativity at its best <br />This strip was full of creativity and fun. Part of its charm was its ability to give a nostalgic look back at childhood through realist's glasses.  <br /> <br />Jameson L Thottam ..Waterman's social commentary <br />As the series progressed, its creator began to include some social satire in his strips. This became seriously hysterical. I just loved Calvin's gum magazine \\"Chewing.\\"  <br /> <br />This set is designed for collectors. It includes everything done for the strip over the years in three hardbound books collected in a slip case. This includes an all new introduction as well as covers and extra illustrations done for the collections over the years. The biggest draw back is the size. These are heavy books, and it's really hard to curl up with them and read for a few hours.  <br /> <br />Jameson Thottam ***only for the true fan*** <br />This set is for the serious Calvin and Hobbes fan. If you aren't already in love with these characters, find a collection today so you can meet them. Either way, you'll want the paperback collections for your everyday Calvin and Hobbes reading.  <br /> <br />Jameson Thottam - Someday history will repeat itself with Bill <br />And maybe, someday, we can convince Bill Watterson to come out of retirement and give us further adventures of this wonderful duo. <br /> <br /> <br />Jameson Thottam
B00079FUI6|5.0|I have to admit that this is one of the best shows that I've ever seen in my life. I really felt in love with the girls of \\"SEX AND THE CITY\\" and although lots of people compare \\"DH\\" with \\"SATC\\". I believe that they're very different. \\"SATC\\" was fun, crazy and with some touching moments but this one has mistery mixed with drama and comedy. <br />The story from this show, starts with the suicide of Mary Alice a woman who lives in a nice and quiet place called Wisteria Lane. This woman was married and had a teenage boy, from this point on starts the mistery of why she killed herself. Her four best friends; Susan (Teri Hatcher), Lynette (Felicity Huffman), Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) and Bree (Marcia Cross) start to put things togetehr about her suicide but nothing matches. While they start getting information you have the change to know them very well... <br />Susan (Teri Hatcher) is divorced, has a teenage daughter and is the kind of woman that everything happends to her and is always between embarrassing moments. She lives kinda depressed until one day she meets a new neighbor who she happends to like very much. Then there's Lynette (Felicity Huffman), who has 3 little boys and a baby girl. She used to be a successful executive but after her marriage she became a housewive. Her kids drive her crazy and her husband is always travelling. <br />Bree (Marcia Cross) is an obsessed woman who likes to have everything perfect in her life and happeneds to be so cold with her husband sometimes that that got her to the edge of a divorce. Her two teenagers also have a bit acid reltionship with her. Finally there's Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) who seems to have the prefect life. She's married and her husband instead of giving her his full attention, he simply buys her whatever she wants. Diamonds, cars, etc. She feels empty and she has an affair with her gardener. <br />The husbands also happend to have desperated lifes also. <br />Many things happend during this first season. The production is very good, the cast is flawless and the episodes get better and better. <br />This package is loaded with lots of bonus features including deleted scenes, secrets of Wisteria Lane, Oprah Winfrey as a neighbor, behind the scenes and much more. <br />Touchstone is really breaking all the records with this successful series and \\"LOST\\" another series that I really recommend, it's different but very good also.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Jameson Thottam and a Wickedly good CD <br /> <br />Jameson Luke Thottam: Overview <br />Who doesn't know the story of the Wizard of Oz? Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion. But what about the Wicked Witch of the West? Was she really as wicked as everyone made her out to be? If she were, how did she get that way?  <br /> <br /> <br />Jameson Thottam: Story Line <br />Loosely based on the novel by Gregory Maguire, Wicked is the story of Elphaba; a young woman who was born with a green tint to her skin, and a sour attitude about life. That is, until she goes away to Shiz University, and begins to experience life more fully than she ever had before. Due to a mixup in rooming assignments, she gets paired with a spoiled, rich, popular girl named Galinda. It seems at first they wouldn't get along, but in time they grew to become the best of friends. Galinda eventually became the Good Witch of the North and changed her name to Glinda.  <br /> <br /> <br />Jameson L Thottam: Elphaba's Dream <br />Elphaba's dream is to become an apprentice of sorts to the Wizard of Oz--until she discovers that the \\"all-knowing\\" wizard isn't who he seems. When events at Shiz come to a head, Elphaba rebels to become the Wicked Witch of the West. The things that transpire during school and afterwards make up the history of Elphaba's life.  <br /> <br /> <br />Jameson Thottam and Beef with the Tony Award <br />I admit to being pretty upset that Wicked didn't take home the Tony Award for Best Musical, but I think they made up for that by becoming one of the more popular shows on Broadway today, and also becoming one of the best selling cast albums by recently reaching 500,000 (Gold) in sales.  <br /> <br />Jameson Luke Thottam: Wicked's CD <br />The CD starts out with \\"No One Mourns The Wicked\\"; the citizens of Oz are celebrating the death of the Wicked Witch and asking Glinda (Kristin Chenoweth) if she knew the Witch. As Glinda says what she thinks the crowd wants to hear, sheflashes back to the first day at Shiz University and the first time she met Elphaba (Idina Menzel).  <br /> <br />Jameson Thottam: Songs <br />Highlight songs on the CD include \\"The Wizard and I\\", \\"Dancing Through Life\\", \\"Popular\\" (showing off Chenoweth's comedic talents), \\"I'm Not That Girl\\", \\"Defying Gravity\\" (Menzel's epic song), and \\"No Good Deed\\". Chenoweth and Menzel sparkle on this recording, showing why they were both nominated for Tony Awards for their respective roles. Norbert Leo Butz played Fiyero, Galinda's boyfriend and friend to Elphaba.  <br /> <br />Jameson L. Thottam: Quality <br />I thought the quality of the CD was also great. No jarring cuts between songs, spoken parts weren't too soft, music wasn't too fuzzy or garbled.  <br /> <br />Jameson Thottam: Final Comments <br />Wicked is a wonderful recording and definitely worth adding to a person's musical theatre collection. Stephen Schwartz's lyrics and music are worth getting to know. <br /> <br />Jameson Luke Thottam
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I just got this movie the other day (RIGHT after it was released in the US, actually).  I don't normally buy movies on DVD without first seeing them, but I decided to go ahead and do it with this one because I had heard such good reviews about it from people whose opinions I trust very highly, since they have similar tastes. <br /> <br />I'm glad I did buy it because this movie was made SO well.  The story is a fairly common one- actually, it is very similar to Pride and Prejudice, with one character very proud for much of the movie, and another being prejudiced against the first, all based on a misunderstanding.  Some scenes even harken back to the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice, but this film also stands very firmly on its own two feet.  It is set in the North of England, and everything from the background scenery (with cotton flying through the air surrounding the mills) to the accents of the characters (very easy to make class distinctions) is done wonderfully. <br /> <br />The characters also come across very well.  I had never heard of either Richard Armitage or Daniela Denby-Ashe before this production- now I'll be sure to watch for them.  Armitage's portrayal in particular was spectacular.  He gave Mr. Thornton's character so much depth that it really was possible to feel, like Miss Hale, that the man had major flaws, but fall in love with him all the same. <br /> <br />I didn't think Daniela did as well a job at portraying Margaret Hale as Richard Armitage did with portraying Mr. Thornton, but she did act pretty well.  And the movie, overall, is superb.  Between the authentic settings, the beautiful music, and the wonderful plot, I fell in love with North & South.  And if you, like me, enjoyed BBC's Pride and Prejudice, Wives and Daughters, and all its other period productions, I have no doubt you will ejoy this one as well.

B0000035E7|4.0|Nirvana's debut album \\"Bleach\\" met with little fanfare upon its release in 1989. At the height of hair-metal, few outside the Seattle underground scene had heard of the band, much less the word \\"grunge.\\"<br /><br />\\"Bleach\\" was recorded within a few weeks with producer Jack Endino on a six thousand dollar budget. It was released on the legendary indie label Sub Pop.<br /><br />\\"Bleach\\" features core members Kurt Cobain (guitar, vocals) and Krist Novoselic (bass). Recorded before Dave Grohl joined the band, drummer Chad Channing sits behind the kit. While Channing is competent, he is no Grohl. Therefore, \\"Bleach\\" doesn't quite have the intensity of their later work, although it's still an exciting power trio. Guitarist Jason Everman is credited as a second guitarist, although he did not play on the album.<br /><br />Compared to \\"Nevermind,\\" (1991) and \\"In Utero,\\" (1993) \\"Bleach\\" is grittier, rawer, and far less polished. \\"Bleach\\" is more akin to fellow Sub Pop Seattle label mates Green River, Mudhoney and Soundgarden than later-day Geffen-era Nirvana. \\"Bleach\\" has a primal, earthy, organic sound. \\"Bleach\\" is grunge in its truest sense-distorted guitars, fuzz, feedback etc.<br /><br />\\"Bleach\\" shows a young Cobain at his formative years. While \\"Bleach\\" doesn't match the brilliance of later day Nirvana, hints of genius are found in such songs as the down-and-gritty \\"Blew,\\" the tuneful-but-melancholy \\"About a Girl,\\" and the full-throttle assault of \\"Negative Creep.\\"<br /><br />While the songs aren't as tightly written as those on \\"Nevermind\\" and \\"In Utero,\\" it's still a fine collection of well-crafted songs. \\"Bleach\\" would lay the base for the foundation of one of rocks great bands.
B000002LND|5.0|You can have the haggard, British soccer mom Madonna, but for me and millions of others, this album is how I'll want to remember her. I'm not even a particularly big fan of her but it's amazing that when I first played this CD, EVERY DARN TRACK WAS RECOGNIZABLE. And they're all just about good, from the goofy Like A Virgin, Material Girl and Papa Don't Preach, to more outstanding contemporary tracks like Live To Tell, Like A Prayer and Vogue, this album is just a lot of fun without too much pretension. The additional tracks even have high standard quality to them that they feel like they're apart of the hits themselves then some thrown on tracks to get the long time fans to buy this compilation. All in all, eighties pop music was a lot of fun, and this CD showcases the music as well as the artist at its peak.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Excellent, Excellent Excellent...still exciting to see that an artist can still make new and refreshing music to shake our arses off on the dancefloor...no stupid pop music from these teen-something wannabes.
0743454537|2.0|My Sister's Keeper was a let down for me. I am typically a fan of Piccoult's work which has the tendency to push the bar on plausibility and does often lean to the over dramatic side but usually the plot and her writing strengths such as settings and characterization keep a balance in her work, this novel just got ridiculous. The ending was silly. This book attempted to take on too many issues at once had this merely involved the two sisters it would have been enough but throwing in the issues of the lawyers, the mother, the father and practically the son's problems gave this book the feeling of everything but the kitchen sink, if you want a good Piccoult book choose Salem Falls or Vanishing Acts both of which are well done and are real page turners.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I awaited Madonna's new album release with bated breath. After \\"American Life\\" received such a poor reception in 2003, I was actually worried about Madonna's position in the modern music world. I personally loved that album, it's very underrated and contains a lot of her best material, but it only sold 5 million copies worldwide which is pretty poor when compared to her usual album sales. The only way Madonna could really go was up, and she has done - bigger than I ever expected. The release of \\"Confessions On A Dance Floor\\" was preceded by a £5 million marketing campaign to get Madonna's name back out there into the public conscious, and it seems to be working a treat.<br /><br />This album went on sale last Monday in the UK and has sold around 220,000 copies this week alone, and is almost destined to be No.1 for weeks on end. That's a smashing figure for someone who's last album sold a mere 60,000 in its first week to get to No.1. America tends to be, how can I put this, more inclined towards R'n'B radio fodder, so this album may not do as well over there, but who cares when Madonna's topping the charts in practically every foreign territory outside the US?! Madonna's new sound aims to create 'future dance music' by mixing old with new into a funky hybrid of glorious, unashamed pop perfection. She achieves her goal with this album, and then some; not one ballad interrupts the continuous dance flow over almost an hour.<br /><br />The album opens with the first single \\"Hung Up.\\" This track is pretty much a classic already. It's been talked about for months because it samples ABBA's \\"Gimme Gimme Gimme (A Man After Midnight),\\" and incredibly successfully I might add! The way the sample segues into the dance beat is flawless in every way, resulting in a song that has stormed to No.1 in almost 20 countries worldwide. This version of the song runs for almost six minutes and is the video version, where the song breaks down to its simplest form towards the end. This song will become a gay anthem! \\"Get Together\\" is rumoured to be a single and I hope it is because this song is just perfection. It opens with alarm clocks going off, before a synth beat builds up until Madonna sings her parts. The beat breaks down into this wonderful concoction of taps before reversing on itself and exploding into a crazy synth section. The lyrics are fun and carefree, and I can imagine this song being a bit hit on Madonna's world tour next year. \\"Sorry\\" is rumoured to be the next single and would be a massive hit all over the world. It opens with Madonna speaking in a foreign language, before the beat builds and crashes us into the chorus, \\"I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know, please don't say you're sorry. I've heard it all before, and I can take care of myself.\\" The music is generally upbeat but the subject matter suggests something completely different.<br /><br />\\"Future Lovers\\" is a stunning song that I think deserves more respect and attention. People have said that it samples Donna Summer's \\"I Feel Love,\\" but it doesn't, otherwise it would say in the booklet that comes with the album. Madonna speaks a lot on this song and there's some wonderful breaks where she sings, \\"In the evidence of its brilliance!\\" I love the chorus and the build up to it, it's very funky. I'd love this song to be a single, because a video would be amazing - imagine a desert much like the one in the \\"Frozen\\" video being lit up by disco lights shining down out of the sky! \\"I Love New York\\" is introduced by majestic drum rolls and a joyous beat that will shake your body to the core. The lyrics in this song are so bad, but I can forgive them for the sheer pop perfection that Madonna displays once more! \\"Let It Will Be\\" is another great song that has a catchy string arrangement in the intro. The beat is rather complex and echoes around. The lyrics are quite serious as Madonna sings about life and her experiences throughout the past 25 years. \\"Forbidden Love\\" is one of the album's best songs, because it's probably the most ballad-like song on the album even though it has a funky beat! It opens beautifully with muffled synths crying out into the night sky as Madonna sings about a forbidden love. The chorus is lush and almost pastoral, the voice distortion adding a sort of sadness to the song's subject matter. This blends perfectly into the next song as Madonna counts down \\"5...4...3...2...1!\\"<br /><br />A peppy dance beat that bounces along like no tomorrow arrives in the form of \\"Jump.\\" This song is incredible and just has to be a single! It would be No.1 everywhere! The verses of this song remind me of Madonna's \\"Erotica\\" era in that her voice is very low and sexy. The chorus is pure perfection as she sings about getting ready to jump into the great unknown! The lyrics are also pretty great too, the best being, \\"And life's gonna drop you down like the limbs of a tree. It sways and it swings and it bends until it makes you see!\\" Pure pop perfection, only Madge can do it this good. \\"How High\\" is another brilliant song with a catchy chorus break as Madonna sings, \\"How high are the stakes? How much fortune can you make?\\" In this song Madonna sings about her life and how she managed to achieve so much. She doesn't know the answers, and perhaps that's the way. \\"Isaac\\" has been dubbed the worst song on the album, but it's anything but! This is six minutes of spiritual dance music. The male vocals come courtesy of Yitzhak Sinwani and work a treat when contrasted with Madonna's feminine sighs. The chorus is a ride of pure joy and the rollercoaster of beats, clicks and beeps that this song takes you on is breathtaking. \\"Push\\" is a song Madonna wrote about her husband Guy Ritchie and how he pushes her to keep going on. It's catchy, but somehow this song just doesn't work for me. The album closes with \\"Like It Or Not\\" where Madonna sings about her determination to keep going despite what her critics may say. Remember, you can hate her but it's only gonna make her strong. The woman is a machine when it comes to her job, and she ain't going anywhere.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />I'd just like to say that the Mariah Carey fans - members of \\"Team Lamb\\" - are absolutely pathetic for submitting an onslaught of negative reviews of this album to try and bring it down in sales and ratings. The only feud between these two superstars is the one the 'fans' create to entertain themselves. I do like Mariah, but Madonna is in a completely different league. She transcends popular culture and has stamped her mark on every aspect of entertainment. She crosses over, because she is a cultural chameleon and she will *always* be on top no matter what. Confessions On A Dance Floor will sell millions worldwide and has already reconfirmed Madonna's status as the most famous and culturally significant woman in the world. This album is essential for Madonna's biggest fans, and for anyone interested in hearing a conceptually brilliant dance record. They're hard to come by, but Madonna clearly delivers the goods as always.<br /><br />EDIT: Wow, what can I say? Album has hit No.1 in a total of 39 countries to date, the most EVER by any artist/band in the history of popular music. Shipped 3 million copies worldwide in its first week on sale alone. Hung Up has hit No.1 in almost 30 countries worldwide and topped the world chart for more than a month now. Madonna is experiencing the best chart success of her entire career.

0688170528|2.0|I am typically a fan of Picoult but this book was missing something. I had trouble caring about the characters and I just felt creeped out the entire book, the closeness of the two families and the dating of the kids felt almost incestuous. I did not like this book and was really disappointed; I would recommend Vanishing Acts or Salem Falls instead.
6305882592|5.0|I had heard about this movie through friends but was never impressed by the story. A reclusive anti social kid who befriends and falls in love with an elderly (though young at heart) eccentric. I wrote it off completely til I saw a bit of it on television and thought it was hilarious and as it turns out I rented the movie and was extremely hooked. Harold is a rich kid with a high strung, selfish mother who tries anything to find a suitor for him, in turn Harold escapes from his home to overshadow funeral processions and memorials. At a number of these events, Maude is in attendence and she lights up the scene with her off the wall,and positively upbeat personality that horrifies and amuses Harold. After a while they become unlikely friends. Maude helps Harold live a little and in turn he develops true affection to Maude. With Ruth Gordon's charm and incredible acting abilites, and Cat Steven's classy soundtrack, its not hard to find yourself feeling happy and free after the movie is over. It really teaches you a message about being your own person and enjoying life.
B000002UAU|5.0|This is directed to the reviewer \\"MTV Supporter\\" Anyone who gives a 5-Star review to 50 Cent, and does not recognize the Beatles as one of the greatest bands in modern history is just ignorant. And are you sure you are over the age of 13, couldn't tell by your spelling.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|This movie was a real mind trip to me!  I love these kinds of movies.  I, for one really cared about the characters which made it even better.  I wanted both of them to get out alive.  With all the CG **** out there now, this movie is a real treat!  It kept me interested, and I like the way it all unfolded.
B00005LC3Y|4.0|As with Apocalypse Now, whose journey upriver is far superior to the meandering scenes in Kurtz's compound, and the first half of Silence of the Lambs whose brisk investigation is so much better than the long scenes in the basement with Bill, Full Metal Jacket opens brilliantly then levels off.  Like these other films, though, the decline is not precipitous enough to ruin the movie.  Rather, the great first half carries the rest.  An imperfect, but really fine film.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I LOVE this CD!! <br /> <br />I had low expectations for Confessions on a Dance Floor.  After her last two CD's (Music and American Life), I wasn't sure what to expect.  I only purchased Music for \\"Don't Tell Me\\", and I didn't bother purchasing American Life.  You have to know that I have every single CD that Madonna has released, so to NOT purchase a CD, that was a big thing.   <br /> <br />Then I heard the single, Hung Up, and I thought that just maybe Confessions would be good.   Well, I was wrong -- Confessions on a Dance Floor is Madonna's BEST CD!!  I really, really love Like a Prayer & Ray of Light, but they just don't compare to Confessions. <br /> <br />I literally love every single song.  If I had to choose some favorites, I'd say Hung Up, Get Together, Let It Will Be, Jump, How High and Like It or Not.  But again -- I love all of the songs!! <br /> <br />Madonna -- Thank you for this wonderful CD!
B000B8QEZG|3.0|This CD is good. No mistake about it. Still it is far from great or even in the top 20 of the year, perhaps the top 100. The production is great which is perhaps the albums most redeaming quality but the lyrics aren't memorable and not very thoughtful/meaningful as those from the Ray of Light album for example. I'd say I enjoyed perhaps half of the 12 songs, the other 6 you can skip, especially her, \\"I love NY\\" which is perhaps lamest song of the CD.
0064471837|5.0|I first entered the world of Sabriel my freshman year in High School... It profoundly affected me, and I passed the book to my best friend, who also delved directly into the book... By far, this is the most inspiring, original, and creative sci-fi novel I have ever read - and I am definitely not a novice to sci-fi! Just this past summer, my first semester in college, I re-read the trilogy out loud to a fellow dorm-mate: she absolutely adored the story and soaked up the novels like a sponge... Honestly, you will not find a better sci-fi novel than Sabriel - this novel has depth, it is penetrating, realistic - all the various devices and tricks that make a fantastic book... Let your imagination run wild with this one - the descriptions are wonderful... Let the bells sound, for freedom.... ~*~Suzy~*~
B00005JN0T|1.0|Just another overblown, overspecial effected, hollywood mess with very little thought to good plot or dialogue. And that actress is not attractive enough for a movie with this budget.  And Will Smith needs to spend less time in the weight room and more time in an acting class.  And all this old fashioned Sci-Fi just doesn't make good movies today. (see war of worlds)
B000BB1MI2|3.0|I loved the original Willy Wonka. He lived in a colorful, and exciting place. Not so much for the one because Tim Burton tries to make Willy Wonka seem too dark. I don't like the factory as much and the kids are MAJOR brats. Probably too much to make their characters seem real. The factory didn't need to have the squirrels in it and I didn't like that they had to same person be every Oompa Luumpa. It didn't feel right. There are too many songs in this movie and none of them are even really good except the first one. I applaude Tim Burton for trying not to stick too close to the old formula but he changed too much for a fan of the older movie to get me to enjoy the new one.
B000002U82|5.0|If you push play at the third roar of the lion, youll be truly amazed how this album is the soundtrack for the first half of the movie.  even the cover art alludes to it: black and white changing to color. It will heighten your enjoyment of the album as well.

B000BI0WOA|5.0|Knopfler has always, from the very first DS record, turned out albums that sounded incredibly brilliant. The hallmarks of that band were its pristine definition as well as its seamless sophistication. Those admirable qualities enhanced great songs. <br />In this new edition, in time for the holidays, Knop has culled a best od DS and his own work, and while I would have loved to see \\"Money for Nothing\\" omitted and \\"Lady Writer\\" included, at least Money is buried far enough down the track list on Disc one as to be easily forgettable. That's a song that outlived its shelf life on the first go 'round and should hereafter be retired. The rest is hard to argue with, and the inclusion of the themes from \\"Local Hero\\" and \\"Cal\\" two of the best soundtracks anyone has ever written, are the perfect transition from DS to the solo career. Pity he couldn't squeeze a Notting Hill tune in or the odd collaboration with Atkins, but maybe on Volumes 3 & 4, he'll correct all that. <br />For the moment, this is an extremely listenable and highly enjoyable collection that sounds better than you have any right to expect. The presence and the definition, the subtle things going on in the background of the songs have more clarity than they ever did, and that's saying something! As an added treat, the whole collection finishes with a song from the forthcoming Knop/Emmy Lou Harris disc! Inspired! I can hardly wait! Among a collection of amazing songs, this one jumps out and tackles you where you stand. Great stuff!
B000AP04OM|1.0|I was able to find a copy of this \\"new remastered\\" version of SOUND OF MUSIC yesterday, along with OKLAHOMA. The latter is a downright disaster, while SOUND OF MUSIC, remarketed and milked for the umpteenth time is not a disaster, but a definite disappointment. <br /> <br />High quality extras from the previous DVD were not carried over. <br />The new extras are \\"nice\\", but ultimately boring <br /> <br />The transfer itself seems somehow fuzzier and less sharp than my old disc. I returned the new disc to the store where I bought it as \\"defective\\". It certainly is. <br /> <br />AVOID THIS DISC and WAIT FOR A TRUE RESTORATION and REMASTERING!
0553801503|5.0|Ok so this is no Storm of Swords. But to say that this book had no important events and that \\"nothing happened\\" is the biggest load of crap ever. The book does feel like only a half, but some of the characters' stories are tied up nicely. George RR Martin's writing style is as flawless as ever the and intrigue as twisted as ever. Reading about the fall of Cersei is a good time. You know she's not going to suceed but it is still entertaining to watch her try. The finalies of all the characters set the story up for an explosion of violence that will most likely occur in A Dance with Dragons. An awesome read, and worth the wait. A feast for Crows is still better than 99% of the fantasy on the market. Highly recommended.
B0000019HU|5.0|I was in this thrift store called Trash about 45 minutes away from my home and I was browsing through the vinyl they had there, me being kind of a newfound record collector. I had heard about Slint for a long time, and how Spiderland was a great experimental/alternative rock album, and how it was essential. The guy who worked there told me that Spiderland was one of the greatest albums ever, and told me to buy it. So I did. I might've listened to Slint half-heartedly in the past, as well as other bands like June of 44, but then I learned that David Pajo (ex-Tortoise, ex-Zwan - both bands I like) was in it and that made me curious about this album, since I liked Tortoise's \\"Millions Now Living...\\" LP so much.  <br /> <br />When I put on this album, it immediately sucked me in. An aspiring composer, I felt that Slint's style of odd time signatures, heavy cruching guitars, and cryptic vocals/lyrics were the sound I was always kind of looking for. They amalgamated punk rock's energy without being purist or too simplistic, and prog's knack for odd tiem signatures and extended song lengths without being at all pretentious. The record itself has an enigma to it, from the black & white cover of four men in the water, from its interesting song titles (\\"Nosferatu Man,\\" \\"Good Morning Captain,\\" \\"Don Aman,\\" \\"Breadcrumb trail,\\" \\"For Dinner,\\" \\"Washer\\" - I know they're not in order!), from how it sounded. I remember the opening to \\"Don Aman\\" and how it made me feel. Just a soft yet unsettling voice saying \\"Don stepped outside...\\" and the eeriest guitar chords coming out shortly after. Very rarely can a song just reach out and grab you like that one did for me. The lyrics have a certain enigma of them, exploring human emotions and romance in bizarre and ambiguous ways that only a few can do, despite the fact that a lot of the lyrics aren't that audible. Spiderland is one of those albums you have to spin a numerous amount of times before all of its subtleties and elements can be revealed. Sadly, Spiderland doesn't get as much credit as it deserves, but it stands as a magum opus for those who have discovered it and given it their undivided attention.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|First, if you are already familiar with the book or previous film, don't go in planning to compare.  This is a Tim Burton work full of his own unique way of approaching a subject.  The storyline is ultimately a morality tale of the author Dahl.  Each child personifying a particular vice (or in Charlie's case, virtue).  Like the denizens of Dante's inferno -- each child's bad habit or malicious behavior leads to an exactly appropriate retribution.  This is not lighthearted children's fun, by any means.  The factory as presented by Burton is a weird yet beautiful place -- but very ominous at all times.  Johnny Depp is his usual genius.  How can anyone not admire his excellent work.  Especially good, too, are the children actors.  But my biggest praise has to go the the design and presentation of the oompa loompas.  One actor, Deep Roy, plays them all -- and what a marvelous job he does!  You really have to see this to believe it.  Finally, though some people don't care for the back story Burton presents, how fun to have Christopher Lee as a candy loathing dentist father for Wonka!.  I recommend this film highly!

B00008BXJ6|5.0|what a GREAT album.if you love ROCK as much as i do than i can't see why you wouldn't like this album just as i much as i do.couldn't help but think,as listening to this,that this era of ac/dc is so much better than the brian johnson era because it rocks so much harder.it's almost as if it's punk.songs about sex and violence are really all of what Bon sang about.but who cares? so they aren't interested in saving the world.instead they are dwelling in all of what it has to offer.plus Bon could be throating the phone book and i would still love it because of Angus and one of the best rhythm sections in rock history.but why weren't they as big as they should have been during this time? who knows? i'm just glad that i got to see 'em and grateful that we still have the music to rock out to afterall these years.and they still rock! great band!!!!
0553801503|4.0|Granted, this is not the swashbuckler we might expect from GRRM but it'll do, pig, it'll do.  I liked (oh, the horror, the horror!) the chapters on Brienne; while she doesn't have the unforgettable turn that Arya did in the last offering (\\"Is there any gold in the village?\\") she does come across as a tortured soul consistent with GRRM's intent in charging her with the almost hopeless task of finding Sansa.  I agree that Cersei starts to seem one-dimensional which is too bad.  I enjoyed seeing all her little plots fall apart (or suspecting that they have/will) in one way or another.      In reading through the reviews I'm surprised that some are vowing never to read Dance of Dragons.  Ha-ha.  I'll bet you a blade of Valyrian steel that you don't stick to that vow.
0060958324|2.0|I found this book barely worthwhile.  I started reading it largely due to its fame and impressive selling history.  I'm sorry to say it was an unsatisfying exercise, one that towards the end I was doing just to see if there was some climactic ending (which there was not).  The entire book takes place on a cross-country motorcycle ride that Pirsig takes with his son Chris, accompanied early on by two friends.   <br /> <br />The first half of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is fairly engaging.  The last half is exceedingly boring and inscrutable.  Pirsig goes on ad nauseum into the abstraction  of \\"quality\\"; he's obsessed with it.  He does not however (as far as I can tell) clearly define the term as he uses it.  It's ostensibly not the conventional \\"quality\\" we're accustomed to.  Regardless, I found myself reading only the first sentence of many paragraphs as he went on and on about the subject.  He spent at least 100 pages of the last half of the book delving into his thought process many years ago. I found these sections of void of cogent points on anything other than his emerging insanity.   <br /> <br />It seems Pirsig used the title as marketing more than an indicator of the content, as there are few sections on Zen or the accompanying values.  It's safe to assume Pirsig took his personal journal of his motorcycle riding and published it, giving little thought to wrapping the ideas he had together into a unified theme.  <br /> <br />His relationship with his accompanying son, Chris, was a source of frustration. The kid is apparently psychologically unstable, which is perfectly expectable given his father.   <br /> <br />I find myself wondering why this book is as successful as it is; perhaps I missed whatever value millions of readers have found in this book.  While the first half was mildly worthwhile, the remainder left a sour taste in this reader's mouth.   <br />
0307276902|5.0|This book hit home.  His depiction held me captive until the very end and I still wanted to know more.  I have known people who have overcome addiction both with an AA type program and those who chose to be free of their addiction without that help.  It reminded me of the courage it took for those individuals to face their demons.

Then Kylie's career took off really big, madonna <br />used to tell media that she does not know who Kylie was. i know she is media player and she played well. while madonna fell to the downside of musicground for really hard, Kylie's career and music went just huge success (like used to, America does not answer this question, well who cares, everyworld went crazy for Kylie) when i'm looking at Madonna's new album promo pictures i just wanna ask, how many times she saw Kylie's Chocolate Music Video ? and How Many times she listned to Kylie's EMI albums ? <br /> <br />well, it's fair that including Kylie, a lot of late 80's or early 90's stars trying to copy Madonna. but Madonna should be original , not copy Kylie's Music & Style,Image. <br /> <br />Just Shame on you, Madonna
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Please dont believe people writing bad reviews about this album, it is truly great and most importantly, consistent. You can easily listen to it from beginning to end without wanting to skip a song and each song has its own melody/chorus and unique attraction. I will admit that the album is more Euro-pop then American pop, but if you like dance music with very catchy melodies, this is a great album and you will not be dissapointed.
0385512058|4.0|Despite having to sift through the book for nuggets, I thought Ferrazzi's book was good for the following reasons: <br /> <br />1) The chapters are short and can be easily absorbed. <br />2) The language he uses is relatively jargon-free. <br />3) Even though he comes across as dropping names, I think his objective is to 'impress upon us' and not 'impress us'. <br />4) It is quite candid. <br />5) It had practical advice stemming from experience. <br /> <br /> <br />The one thing that I liked the most is his \\"Networking Action Plan\\" (NAP). The NAP has 3 parts. <br /> <br />a) Goals that help you fulfil your mission. The objective is to create a 3-yr goal and work backwards to create yearly and quarterly goals. Each timeframe will have an \\"A\\" and a \\"B\\" goal that will contribute in accomplishing the overall goal.   <br /> <br />b) The second aspect is the connection of these goals to people, places and things that will help accomplish the goals. This can be achieved by connecting the \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" goals to people and/or organizations that can help in that goal. <br /> <br />c) The best way to reach out to the people who can help accomplish the goals. These strategies of reaching people could be cold-calling, being audacious, not being a networking jerk, being a conference commando, having genuine interest in people, finding a mentor, being a mentor and so forth. The book is full of these kind of strategies to connect with people. <br /> <br />The key to perfection as always is practice and practice can only happen when action is taken. Ferrazzi does urge us to take action and make it happen. A good book overall. <br /> <br />More book summaries at [...]
B00005JO1P|4.0|This movie holds up entirely because of the performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon.  The best of part of those performances is the singing.  Most of us always knew Mr. Phoenix was a fine young actor and he doesn't disappoint in the least.  When I heard Reese Witherspoon was cast as June Carter, though,  I thought it was as silly as pairing Britney Spears with Russell Crowe.  Boy was I wrong! She is a complete surprise, especially her singing, and she contributes as much as Phoenix to the film. <br /> <br />I was a bit disappointed in the story, because it stuck pretty much to the musical bio style that Hollywood's been using for half a century.  It could have been about almost any music megastar. We learn a lot about Cash's domestic problems and his addictions, but we gain little insight into the shaping of the talent that allowed him to write and perform as powerfully as he did.  But, again, the performances are so wonderful, they more than compensate for the underwhelming script. <br /> <br />As I was watching this movie, I couldn't help thinking what a wonderful Phantom of the Opera Joaquin Phoenix would have been. <br /> <br />Walk the Line won't fail to entertain you. <br /> <br />
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira's 2001 release, Laundry Service is the perfect transition from Latin music Icon, to American music idol. As a person of Spanish ancestry I can easily understand her Spanish lyrics. Included are the American radio hits, and some more beautiful Spanish ballads. On \\"Eyes like yours\\" Shakira collaborates with Gloria Estefan and creates an upbeat techno type song. There are many Spanish (Spain) influenced songs on this album which creates a wonderful feeling. Shakira writes all of her own songs, and produces them as well. We need more musicians such as herself in the United States.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I missed Firefly when it was on TV. A sad fact that I didn't understand until I saw it on DVD about a year too late. It took NO time for Firefly to become my absolute- unquestionable- favorite TV show of all time. This movie was an answered prayer. And honestly- anyone who has NO attachment to this series or this director - this was the BEST MOVIE I saw all year long. It was the best movie experience I've had since Fifth Element.  The characters are the best ever witnessed. Seriously. You will believe that somewhere in the 'verse- these people are on a spaceship, fending off whatever evil tails 'em. The dialogue is so gripping and so quick-n-clever that you will love each and every line. The chemistry between the crew members and the script is perfection. Forget anything you think Sci-Fi is about, then watch Serenity. It will change your views on what you expect from movies, from Sci-Fi and from entertainment in general. Absolutely Brilliant. A MUST own for any movie fan, of any genre.    Bottom line- if you call yourself a fan of Sci-Fi and you don't own this on Blu Ray- stop calling yourself a fan of Sci-Fi. Blu Ray was made for Serenity.
B00005JMAH|4.0|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) <br />Movie Review - **** (out of *****) <br /> <br />Here, we finally get to see everybody's favorite young wizard-in-training get the screen treatment that he deserves.  No, there has not been a truly great Harry Potter movie yet-but this is a step in the right direction. <br /> <br />Alfonso Cauron brilliantly brings several sensations to Potter that weren't there the first few go-rounds:  genuine, subtle emotion, a brisk pace, and a sense of unease and danger.  One thing he also brings to the series is what it really needed:  a sense of freedom.  The biggest problem with the first two movies was that they feared that if they strayed from the books in the slightest they'd never live to be classics.  This movie understands that a movie must break free from its source material and become an entity of its own while never entirely straying from its roots.  Kloves and Cauron know what to take out, what to keep in, and what to add to keep the pace and flow of the movie.  The only section that needed a bit of work was the ending, in which a lot of information must be absorbed in a short amount of time-but that is a small complaint. <br /> <br />The plot revolves around Sirius Black, a convicted murderer who is the first person ever to have escaped Azkaban Prison-and he's after Harry.  As the movie progresses, Harry learns that Sirius Black is related to the events surrounding his parents' murder.   <br /> <br />The greatest power of the book was its unique themes-truth and irony.  Unlike Columbus, whom I doubt could tell you the main theme of Chamber of Secrets, Cauron brilliantly focuses Prisoner of Azkaban on those two aspects, and on Harry's growing sense of longing and the difficulties of his adolescence. <br /> <br />Possibly the aspect of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban that will give it its unique identity apart from the other films is its artsy style of directing.  Anyone who has seen Cauron's previous films knows his range of imagination and innovation, and he brings that to this film, making it feel at the same time like a big-budget production and a smaller film meant for the art theaters.  He deftly mixes metaphor and insight into nearly every frame of the picture, creating a type of Potter which we haven't seen before, and I doubt we'll see again.   <br /> <br />As previously mentioned, however, the film is held back from being great by some slight blunders in the storytelling.  Certain events will lose some viewers; however, those who can understand will find a rich and vivid story that is told by a master storyteller.  The bar has been greatly raised, and the stage is set for everything to change.
B00003CXI1|3.0|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001)  Movie Review - *** (out of *****)    One of the greatest fantasy achievements of recent years came to screen in 2001... with less than spectacular results.  The problem isn't the story.  No, J. K. Rowling's stories (both individually and as a whole) definitely pull their weight.  The problem lies in the poor directing, editing, and screenwriting.  It is very obvious that those involved in this project were determined to create a classic.  The problem is, they don't seem to know what makes a good film.  They simply went through the book page-by-page and put it to screen and trying not to make it too long.     Ironically, that is just what it is.  No, it isn't three hours long, but two and a half hours is pretty darn close, especially considering that Lord of the Rings, a book more than twice the size of Potter #1, only needed an extra half hour-and people complained about them being too long!  The pace of this movie is plan obnoxious at times.  Its unbelievable that Columus and crew actually filmed the original cut at four hours and trimmed it to this length-that's poor screenwriting right there.     Let me bring your attention to one section of the movie that must have taken at least 20 minutes of screen time (or at least felt like it).  Harry and Co. go to Hagrid's hut to talk about the Sorcerer's Stone.  OK, that might be acceptable.  Here's where things go haywire.  Hagrid's hatching a dragon.  During the hatching, Hagrid notices Draco Malfoy looking in on the hatching.  This leads to a scene where Hagrid leads Harry, Ron, and Hermione through detention with Malfoy in the Forbidden Forest.  There, Harry sees a cloaked man drinking unicorn's blood-But wait!  A centaur named Firenze chases the man away and tells Harry that it is Lord Voldemort, who wants the Stone from Hogwarts.  Later, Harry discusses this with Ron and Hermione, and they come to the conclusion that Snape is not after the stone for himself, but for Voldemort.     See why this goes wrong?  Let me give you a hint:  none of it is necessary! OK, so that is a little more than a hint, but the point remains.  The revelation that the Stone was being stolen for Voldemort could have been saved for the end of the movie, and it would have been effective and smart screenwriting!  As for Firenze-what does he amount to?  Nothing!  Oh, sure, argue that he's in \\"Order of the Phoenix.\\"  The problem?  He doesn't amount to anything important in \\"Order,\\" either!  His character could very well have been cut out with no consequence to the story!  The movie could have been effectively trimmed from 150 minutes to 130 minutes!  Viola!       Another problem is the sentimentality.  There simply is no sincere, genuine emotion in this film.  The Mirror of Erised scene, the climactic chess scene where Ron makes his sacrifice, and the ending hospital scene where Harry first learns of the power of love-all of those emotions which were subtle and touching in the novels are reduced to melodrama and mere sentimentality.  It is an opportunity missed... but ah, oh well.     But as you can see from the rating, this still is not a bad movie.  I still enjoyed it enough to give it a positive rating, but only a little.  This could have all gone under if it weren't for the obvious rising talents of the kids, the wonderful performances by the adult actors (especially Alan Rickman as Severus Snape), and the splendid visuals.  With a little more understanding of the differences between movies and books on the part of the production team, it could have been truly great.
B0000AKY7O|5.0|Continuing the path that Caravanserai started on, Welcome is what jazz fusion really is all about.  Released in  1973 between two world tours, Welcome showcased Santana's ability to play excellent music, even after Gregg Rolie and Neal Schon left the band.  This album shows a high level of maturation in the band's music.  Santana went from Afro-Cuban/rock jams, to highly sophisticated compositions. <br />The \\"latin\\" feel is virtually gone in this album. \\"Only Samba de Sausalito\\" and \\"Yours Is the Light\\" show a hint of latin music in them. Nevertheless, all the songs on the album are very good. The highlight of the album, however, is \\"Flame Sky\\". <br />This 11 minute song showcases Carlos Santana and John McLaughlin's breathtaking guitar work. <br />This album is highly recommended for Santana fans and Jazz fans as well. However, if you are new to Santana and you are expecting to hear songs such as \\"Oye Como Va\\" and \\"Evil Ways\\", you might want to get this album a little later, after you have familiarized yourself with Santana's music. You also might want to get Caravanserai first too.

0743265289|5.0|I have been been really busy with work and neither did I have too much time to study for GMATs, nor an extra grand to spend on a prep course.  I needed above a 700 and I know from SAT practice that the prep courses are geared for students aiming for the mid 600s as the goal. <br /> <br />At least for me, I used the Princeton Review Cracking the GMAT (2006 edition) as a starter to familiarize myself with the test. <br /> <br />I think the 10th edition official guide by GMAC is a a great transition.  Honestly, though, the CD was much more useful since it familiarized me with the actual computer format of the exam (although the CAT part of it is questionable - and be careful about doing too many practice questions from the book or the CD sice you might see some recylce on your 2 practice exams).   <br /> <br />However, the best preparation is the GMAT 800 from Kaplan - it's not too great on the strategies, but if you learn by example like me, it's perfect since the examples are challenging and written for somebody aiming for above 93 percentile.  I can't speak too much on the quant section, but the verbal section is awesome. <br /> <br />It has a great section on sentence correction which I found to be incredibly useful in improving my score.  I really feel that by going through all the verbal questions, I learned the fundamental grammer that GMAT requires for a good score. <br /> <br />I was scoring on the practice in the mid 600s, and taking two days off work to completely go through the verbal section of this book was the key to getting me a 750 on the exam <br /> <br />Good luck with your exam and MBA application
B000028U0Y|5.0|Johnny Cash's At Folsom Prison is a seminal record in music history.  Mr. Cash plays to his inmate audience singing songs about jail, crime, loss, regret and isolation.  Mr. Cash's sings the songs with the conviction of a man who suffered these trials & tribulations and connects with his prison crowd.  Songs like \\"Dirty Old Egg Sucking Dog\\", \\"Flushed From The Bathroom Of Your Heart\\", \\"Cocaine Blues\\", Dark As The Dungeon\\" and \\"The Wall\\" speak of the darkness of prison as well as mines the underlying fire and rage in Mr. Cash's music.  \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\" is the most well known song from the album and a true classic.  It perfectly captures the loneliness that the shackles of prison inflict on a man.  At Folsom Prison helped bring Mr. Cash to a rock audience and is one of the late 60's best albums.

B000AYQLX6|4.0|1974's Walls & Bridges was recorded during one of the most personally painful periods in John Lennon's life.  Estranged from wife Yoko Ono and spending his self-described \\"lost weekend\\" in Los Angeles getting drunk with Harry Nilsson, one would think that the music he produced would be in the vein of the Plastic Ono Band album.  Instead, Mr. Lennon recorded some of the most upbeat songs of his career.  Songs like \\"Old Dirt Road\\", \\"Beef Jerky\\" and a cover of \\"Ya Ya\\" show off a goofy side of Mr. Lennon.  \\"Steel & Glass\\" is the most introspective song on the album and \\"#9 Dream\\" is the best track on the album and one of the best of his career.  \\"Whatever Gets You Thru The Night\\" is an incredibly catchy number that features backing vocals by Elton John.  Mr. Lennon thought very little of the song, but Mr. John thought it was a sure fire hit and bet him that if it went to number one, Mr. Lennon would have to appear on stage with him at a concert.  Sure enough it became Mr. Lennon's first solo number one song and Mr. Lennon paid his debt to Mr. John by appearing with him at Madison Square Garden in what would become his last appearance on stage.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|This album is melodic, it is very well produced, the songs flow from one moment/mood to the next but not in a manner that feels disconnected.  It is connected.  I think Madonna still has it.  This is a disc that will inevitably be liked or not (like most of Madonna (and I'll leave it at that)).  I like it.  I think she delivered what we expect.  A few reviews talk about her rehashing, grifting, copying- DUH!@  It's Madonna, she'd copied from everyone, everywhere since the start of her career, the catch though is how she encoporporates what she absorbs into her own mantra.  She has always been a master of this method and remains so.  She will always be an icon but probably never an actress.  I think if Madonna were to take two years of intensive acting lessons in the Meisner method (and really give in to the method)we would see a profound actress and we would then find Madonna the novelist, Madonna the spiritual beacon, Madonna the gifted musician, Madonna the deep poet.  In essence, she shouldn't need to absorb in the way she does now but take in and react more spontaneously, impulsively, genuinely.  We would see the real Madonna, guards down, control gone (because you are't allowed to control and manipulate in Meisner) and we would see REAL connection between Madonna, the world around her and herself.<br /><br />So, who's got the better boots now.
0553381407|2.0|Having come from a dysfunctional family with a controlling mother and escapist father (I will spare the details)this book really hit home for me.  Like many people, I didn't even realize our family had serious problems until I was in my late twenties.  It has been and still is very painful. I confronted my parents by letter many years ago and got just the disappointing results this book warns of.  I was considering doing it again and hoped this book would have helpful advice, but it proposed exactly what I had already tried.  She says not to expect your parents to change, but that the process of confrontation will be liberating.  Then goes through the pros and cons of confrontation and admits that it may not be worthwhile to actually confront your parents and that role playing with others may be more helpful. Okay...  My thinking is that people that don't know they have problems aren't likely to be reading this.  People that know, shouldn't expect to find their answers here...
B000AMJG4Y|3.0|I recently watched this movie and have mixed feelings about it. <br /> <br />First, the good: <br />1. beautiful graphics, very artsy and well drawn with breath taking light renderings <br />2. great camera work - sometimes i thought i was watching a live action film <br />3. nice soundtrack - if music is important to you :-P <br />4. good action - everyone loves a hot chick who can kick butt, and no chick's hotter than a CG chick <br /> <br />Second, the bad: <br />1. facial expressions? anyone? are we all drones here? even nemo had more showing on his face and he's just a fish <br />2. story? i know this is for FF7 fans mainly but lets at least try to target a larger audience, bad guy comes and spoils our children, good guy comes and saves the day. can we get a bit more creative here. the addition of \\"redemption\\" and \\"forgiveness\\" is good but it gets overdramatic. <br />3. character development - yah yah they've been developed already in the game, but this is a new movie, a new chapter in their lives, let's give cloud some more growing. <br /> <br />given that, i would say it's worth watching, but not watching again.
0743454537|5.0|The instant I saw this book in the store I was enthralled. I kept going back to look at it until I had to pick it up and buy it. <br /> <br />The book raises many issues that you hope never to have to face. And it really makes you think about how you would react in that situation and I think it gives you a whole new respect for people who have to go through some of this every day. <br /> <br />I think that the characters are very real and they have feelings that are very typical. I find I can relate to many of them and I have sympathy for all of them. Even if they are fictional they feel so real that I just want to go up to them and give them a hug. <br /> <br />I still have mixed feelings about the end. It was so unexpected and shocking. I remember sitting there shell-shocked with tears running down my face. It was so filled with emotion. And well I think I would rather read a book with an unexpected ending than to know what is going to happen from the start. <br /> <br />This is now my favorite book of all time. My friends could testify because I talk about it all the time. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good read. I daresay this book was more than worth my time.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|Although we've certainly heard these songs before, Krall's voice gives them fresh life and this CD is a nice addition for your holiday collection.
B00005QIPH|5.0|This is one of my favourite cds!!!! I love it so much. When I first bought it and listened, it was so hard to turn it off! I went to school (6 and a half hours), and couldn't listen to it while I was there. I actually missed it and couldn't wait to get home!!! That sounds really sad doesn't it? Well, that's what happens when you listen to this cd!!! It makes me so happy and I don't know what I would have done without it! The second cd is definitely still 4 stars, not quite as good, but I love it!!! <br /> <br />LOVE,LOVE,LOVE!!!! <br />
B000BJS4OY|5.0|I just got this yesterday, haven't even had time to watch the bonus DVDs because I want to carve out a couple of hours of uninterrupted time.  But the BTR remaster--holy crap!  Like all Bruce fans, I have tolerated the horrible CD releases of the earlier stuff, because, not having a reference quality turntable and sound system, those CDs were, frankly, as good as you were going to get.  But now this.  It is, to my ears, a revelation.  I would compare it to the difference between seeing a photograph of Michelangelo's \\"David\\" and then seeing the real thing in Florence--it is difficult to describe how much better this sounds than the version you've been listening to all these years.  I have enjoyed other remasters (such as the Stones' remasters of Let It Bleed, Beggars Banquet, etc.), but have not found them to be as revelatory as this one.  I cannot wait to hear whatever Bruce remaster comes out next.
0553801503|1.0|Like everyone else, I couldn't wait for this book to come out.  And like a lot of other people, I was disappointed.    1.  I can't really blame GRRM for this since the first three books also contained a lot of violence and \\"ugly\\" stuff, but it really got to me in this book.  I found myself thinking, \\"Doesn't anything good ever happen to ANYONE?  Isn't there any happiness in this place?\\"  This is just subjective opinion, but I found myself with fewer and fewer characters to root for.  It seemed like everyone was nasty in this book or fast becoming that way.    2.  GRRM's tendency to kill off favorite characters and replace them with new ones makes it hard for me to remain emotionally connected to the story.  I miss the Starks, who were the good guys.  (I miss their direwolves.)  They made the bad guys more fun because of the contrast.  But when I'm rooting for someone and something vastly unpleasant happens to them, I pull back from the story.  Just replacing them with some random new character doesn't cut it for me.  (Unlike a lot of people, I like Brienne as a character.  Jaime is also a favorite of mine.)  I want more focus on the main characters and less on minor ones.  It's the main characters I've come to care about.    3.  I thought my memory must be going as I read this.  I couldn't remember half the people or situations.  I kept thinking \\"WHO was that again?\\"  I don't remember having this problem with the first three books.    4.  Not enough happens, as everyone has mentioned.    5.  Description and internal dialogue to the point of screaming boredom.    6.  Does this series have a point?  I have the feeling that GRRM is making it up as he goes, and therefore, there's no overall plot.  He throws in characters and situations, then pulls them out when he feels like it.  I'm guessing this series will never end.    For me, all the things mentioned above made me disconnect from the story.  I found myself caring less and less (unlike the first three books, where Iwas very emotionally invested) and skimming more and more.    I'd like to see more editing, more action, less killing/maiming of major characters, and more fun in the story.  I'd like something and someone to cheer for once again.
B00005JO1P|3.0|There is a moment in the new Johnny Cash Biopic WALK THE LINE that is so true and honest it stuck with me throughout the whole film. It's a moment that most people will forget, others will scoff and probably say \\"look at that close-minded Bible-Thumper.\\" But I'll carry that moment with me for a long time. Judith Carter (Reese Witherspoon) is walking around a small five and dime. A former Southern Gospel Child star she has just gone through a horrible divorce. An old sweet women walks up to her and compliments her parents as being great Christians. After Carter thanks her for the sentiment. The old women spews the line \\"Divorce is an abomination\\" thus killing Judith with her down-home Christian Charm and in the process putting good ole James 3:9 into practical application \\"With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in God's likeness.(James 3:9 NIV)<br /><br />Working in Christian Radio I have come into contact with people like this. Hey I was once even accosted by a man in a collar because he didn't like the direction the station was going (and I didn't even make the decisions about that anyway.) But I also remember how easy it is to judge someone for their mistakes. It also allows me to have great admiration for June Carter and her family cause frankly this film allows them to show so much Christian love I'm embarrassed.<br /><br />.....But before this review turns into a sermon allow me to tell you just what I think I of James Mangold's WALK THE LINE.<br /><br />There are some people that are so complex, so multi-dimensional, that to try to sum their lives up in a few hours would be impossible. Johnny Cash is that kind of person. He was a man of faith, a man of sorrow, a man fighting his demons, and a man who had a gentle simplicity. When you saw him you thought he was easily figured out. WALK THE LINE tries and sometimes succeeds. Joaquin Phoenix stars as the Man In Black, and does a good job of becoming Cash. I didn't find myself looking at him and saying here's a guy trying to be someone he's not (earlier this week I sat through CAPOTE, and thought \\"wow that's a great Phillip Seymour Hoffman playing Truman Capote, {in all honesty I was so bored by Capote I fell asleep in the middle of it so that's why there is no review}). It's a good performance because Pheonix tries his hardest to keep Cash grounded. Reese Witherspoon also controls June Carter-Cash with a live vivaciousness. She fills those shoes so well she almost steals the movie away from Pheonix and that's quite okay with me.<br /><br />What doesn't work is a screenplay by Gill Dennis and Director James Mangold that is so difficult to nail down. It jumps from scene to scene because that's what it feels it needs to do. So while the performances are great, the film is too busy trying to play out events, instead of getting to the heart of the matter: WHO WAS JOHNNY CASH?. It gives us scenes with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, and The Man in Black's troubles with drugs, but sometimes forgets that this is a film about a man. It's too pre-occupied with being a bio-pic and not about getting to the heart of the matter: WHO IS JOHNNY CASH? Why must bio-pics be so conservative? Why must we sit through another film about another celebrity that is too busy telling a story to care about the lead characters? (This was the problem with RAY last year. Again a film with great performances, but too preoccupied with getting the viewer from one momentous career moment to the other and not nailing done who RAY CHARLES, really was.) Johnny and June Cater Cash are people with lives far more interesting than this movie.<br /><br />But then there is the music. T Bone Burnett has done it again. He captured the sound of the times. He nails down Cash's music quite nicely. If there is man out there batting a thousand producing soundtracks it's Burnett. From his work on the groundbreaking \\"O Brother Where Art Thou\\" to \\"Cold Mountian\\" he makes the music acharacter in the film. Trying to nail down Cash's music is a monumental challenge because of its rich diversity, but Burnett seems up to the task. I just wonder why he chose to use Phoenix and Witherspoon's voice and not the CASH recordings themselves.<br /><br />I also liked director Mangold's attention to detail. He has captured a changing America not with the turbulent events but with background details. This is a film about Cash, and I'm glad that he captured it that way. Many films take try to hard to pull us into the time period by saying \\"alright here's the sixties cut to a group of hippies protesting Vietnam.\\" WALK THE LINE grounds itself by not making statements about society but by showing us Cash.<br /><br />Then the film eventually ends with a pointless happily ever after moment that steals something from the films final analysis. It feels forced, and leaves us at a place that is too nice and peaceful. It felt like I was watching the end of Leave it to Beaver. Sheer badly paced schmaltz. I wished with film could have ended somewhere else. WALK THE LINE is a fine bio-pic, it has some brilliant acting. But it could have been so much better, CASH was larger than life and WALK THE LINE is too busy immortalizing Cash to let us know him. It's funny that, the small moment with June Cater and the old women struck me so much. It was the moment that felt honest? Who was Johnny Cash? WALK THE LINE doesn't really tell us.the music a character in the film. Trying to nail down Cash's music is a monumental challenge because of its rich diversity, but Burnett seems up to the task.

0027164403|3.0|This book is okay.  Others raved about it but my three year old son found it boring.  The reason I think is that he *wasn't* introduced to this book as a baby or toddler.  First books generally tend to remain favorites, so my advice would be not to buy this for a Preschooler.  A baby or young toddler would probably like it fine.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />-- Pretty sturdy flaps that open from different sides.  This feature helps young children exercise both their memory and fine motor skills (little fingers)<br /><br />-- 17 pages including the title page.  I know the description says 24, but they must be counting blank pages and the covers pages.<br /><br />-- Interesting subject for babies and toddlers.<br /><br />-- Text is repetitive and helps with baby and toddler memory and prediction.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />-- For Preschoolers content is boring.  The eight animals chosen are 'old hat' by the time most children hit the 2 to 3 range.  Animals are:  Elephant, giraffe, lion, camel, snake, monkey, frog, dog.<br /><br />-- There is no rhyme in the text.  Rhyme is one way to teach young children about how words work in similar ways.<br /><br />--Text generally (after the first page) runs along the lines of \\"So they sent me a ...\\" to which the answer is something like \\"He was too ___ ! I sent him back.\\"  [The animal that was kept was a puppy.]<br /><br />Three Stars.  Average book in a large field of similar products.  \\"Dear Zoo\\" seems sturdy (we borrowed ours from the library and one would assume it has seen lots of use) and the drawings are so simple that babies won't have a problem focusing on the subject animal.<br /><br />Take a look at Amazon's \\"Search inside this book\\" feature for an example of text and artwork (\\"Surprise Me\\").
B000B8QEZG|5.0|There are so many good ratings here for this album, I thought mine wouldn't make a difference, but since I acknowledged some desperate Mariah Carey's fans have united with the mission to bombard radio stations, internet sites and everything else with messages denigrating Madonna and her latest work, I thought \\"What the heck ... let me give the gal a positive counterweight!\\" <br /> <br />I'll give you my personal yet true opinion about the songs in this album: <br /> <br />HUNG UP: Sticky as glue. Easy lyrics and powerful beats, and it's all about having fun. But you know that, already. It's everywhere. <br /> <br />GET TOGETHER: Powerful beat too. There's a trance feeling to it and it makes you wanna close your eyes and dance smoothly to the sound of it. Great! <br /> <br />SORRY: Destined to be one of Madonna's new millennium successes. Beautiful lyrics and extremely catchy. Impossible not to sing along with it. If I didn't know already, I'd say this would have to be her next single. I dare you to identify each of the different languages she uses for saying \\"Forgive me\\" in this song.  <br /> <br />FUTURE LOVERS: This is a weird song. It looks somewhat similar to \\"Impressive Instant\\" from her \\"Music\\" album. I guess it's one of those \\"love it\\" or \\"hate it\\" songs. The beat remains unstoppable, tough. <br /> <br />I LOVE NEW YORK: Well, all you new-yorkers out there, you'll just have to forgive me but I think this is the weakest song of them all. The beat is great but the lyrics ... aaaaargh!!! New York and dork, f* off and golf ... blargh!!! I hope this gets to be a sort of an anthem for New York's nightclubs, but I also hope this particular song doesn't see the light of day as an independent single. <br /> <br />LET IT WILL BE: Madonna tries to make a sort of a reflection about her life, here. She talks about the highs and the lows she has come to face, but, has she says, \\"Just watch me burn ... let it will be\\". Great song. <br /> <br />FORBIDDEN LOVE: Imagine a ballad which has been accelerated and remixed with a disco beat. This is best way to describe this song. I can't call it a ballad because there's a good beat in the background, but I guess it's the one song closer to that category throughout the album. Very nice. <br /> <br />JUMP: One of the most enthusiastic and optimistic songs I've heard in ages. I guess this is going to be her third single. It's impossible not to move to this song. Super! <br /> <br />HOW HIGH: Here Madonna recaptures her repressed will to talk about the values she has been continuously learning throughout her life. But don't worry ... this is no \\"American Life\\" remake. This time we have a great song that will make the delights of dancers everywhere. Beautiful! <br /> <br />ISAAC: \\"Frozen\\" with a beat. If you like spirituality inspired pop songs, this one is for you. Not very appropriate for dancing, but it's an ear's delight. The male voice singing in Hebrew in the background gives a sense of antiquity and of spirituality. Personally, I think it was very well achieved.  <br /> <br />PUSH: The second weakest song in the album. The \\"You push me\\" sentence being repeated over and over again gets on my nerves. The message is nice, but the song is as catchy as water. I say I LOVE NEW YORK is worse only due to its poor lyrics, but this one follows suit. A nice message to her Guy, which should have stayed in their intimacy. <br /> <br />LIKE IT OR NOT: Madonna's usual slower and more reflexive song with which she uses to bring an end to her albums' repertoire. The beat here is slower and jazzier and she delievers a message to all you people out there ... \\"This is who I am, like it or not, you can love me, you can hate me, but I'm never ever gonna stop!\\" Very nice to listen to. <br /> <br />Overall, a fantastic album worth discovering. You will not be disappointed, I assure you.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|Wow!  This movie was so funny, colorful, and alive.  I believe this movie followed the book better than \\"Willy Wonka\\".  Though I wouldn't begin to make a comparison as to who was the better Willy Wonka.  Both Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp added a great deal to the character we all love. <br /> <br />I loved Deep Roy as all the Umpa Lumpas.   <br />The music was great. The dance routines were great.   <br />All the actors were supurb.   <br /> <br />Johnny Depp made a fantastic Willy Wonka.  The ontime sarcasm and facial expressions had me rolling in isle. <br /> <br />I play this movie over and over but, I still find myself laughing just as if I was seeing it for the first time.

B000BM6AVA|5.0|Hypnotize is the second half of the mezmerize/Hypnotize and i would have to say this is the better half of the two. There are no radio friendly songs on this albums and thats what makes this album unique. I have to say that this is tied for their best album, Steal this Album. The songs are great and have memorable choruses. This is my review of each song. <br /> <br />Track Listings <br />1. Attack-5/5 Heavy opener. This has to be one of their best openers on the album. Great song.  <br /> <br />2. Dreaming- 5/5 confusing song, but thats what makes this song so funny. I guarantee this song will stick to your head after you hear it. I find myself singing the chorus out of no were. Great Chorus and melody between Serj and Daron. <br />         <br />3. Kill Rock 'N Roll 5/5  \\"I felt like the biggest ass hole when i killed your rock and Roll.\\" This is another Cigaro Bounce song. Funny but its the weaker of the two funny songs of the album. <br />        <br />4. Hypnotize   5/5 Everyone has heard this song. Its their first single of this album and trust me it wont be the last. The chorus is catchy and it has a sort of indian feeling to it. <br /> <br />5. Stealing Society  3/5 this song doesnt really do anything for me. This is usually the track i skip and go straigh to Tentative. <br /> <br />6. Tentative   5/5 Probably the most emotional song they have ever done. This song will leave you in tears with the ending. \\"Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall.\\" Great, GREAT song <br /> <br />7. U-Fig       5/5 The riff is so cool and serj does this cool thing with his lips that it makes the chorus real catchy, but i have to say the main story with this song is the Riff <br /> <br />8. Holy Mountains    5/5 The best song on the album. This song has like an arials chop suey feel. Epic. One of their best songs of all time. Real heavy song with a strong melody at the side. Every time i listen to the song i always find some thing new to this song. What Questions did for mezmerize this will do for Hypnotize. Great song. One of their top 5 of all time. <br /> <br />9. Vicinity of Obscenity  5/5 OMG i cant emphasize how wierd fast and Freaking funny this song is. This has to be the best wierd song the system has ever done. I got one word for you Bannanna <br />       <br />10. She's Like Heroin    3/5 Another weak track. This song doesnt do well for me but alot of people who have heard the album say its one of their best, but i dont feel that way. I guess its based on taste. <br /> <br /> <br />11. Lonely Day        5/5 I love this song. Daron shows how great he is with the guitar with this sad solo. I love this song. The lyrics are stong and the guitar is beautiful. Nothing to complain here. <br /> <br />12. Soldier Side  5/5 Finally the track ive been wanting to tell you all about. This song will have you from intro. This is truely one systems finest anti war songs of all time, if not the best. The lyrics are so deep that you wont catch them the first time. I truely believe that this song will go of to be remembered 10 years from now. I love this song and im pretty sure you will <br /> <br />The bottom Line: Get this album. It is worth it. Like every System Album it takes a while to listen to something new. My view listen to the album twice and give your final thoughts. If the mezmerize/Hypnotize album dont win best album for the Grammies that will be one of the biggest let down in music history. Its that good. <br />
B000BKDOCA|4.0|To get to the point, this is actually a nice collection of remixes. These are 11 of her songs, and not all of them are or have necessarily been big hits. Over half of these mixex are songs off of her last studio album, \\"In the Zone.\\" There's one new song, \\"And Then We Kiss,\\" and there's a remix of her song \\"Someday\\" (I Will Understand) from her reality show, \\"Chaotic.\\"<br /><br />First, the bad. For many of these remixes, the only thing really new or remixed about them is simply a new beat being put behind the regular vocals. A lot of these songs are given a 90s/pop club beat to them. Sort of techno, a bit trance. The other bad part of this release is that while choosing some lesser hits, some missed opportunities to feature other non-singles wasn't taken up. It would have been nice to have had some remixes from the \\"Britney\\" album besides \\"I'm a Slave\\" which happens to be one of the weakest remixes on the album. \\"In the Zone\\" was a great album, but some great remixes could have come from her other three studio albums as well.<br /><br />Besides those minor complaints, the remixes collected are pretty good. Some of the best ones are \\"Everytime,\\" \\"Someday,\\" and \\"Don't Let me be the Last to Know.\\" The new song, \\"And then we Kiss,\\" is a sort of sensual, laid back, \\"come on, let's dance\\" type of song that actually sets the tone for the other songs. It would have been nice if all the remixes didn't have the same casual pop sound to them, and if there had been a bit more variety, but, this is a nice release still.<br /><br />It's a good CD, even when lacking in variety and a good selection of songs from her entire career. For any fan of Spears, it's definately a must have. For the casual pop fan, it still should be on your list of consideration.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Lord, I can hear the cynics & naysayers now...they are gonna LOVE this one. But we'll get to that (briefly) later.<br /><br />For those of us who knew what quality music was way back in 1986, we suspected upon hearing THE CELTS that a new & vital talent had been sprung upon the world, and with each successive CD, Enya has proven one thing repeatedly: When you find a formula that works, sticking with it is usually a wise thing to cement a devoted fan base. For me, several elements fell together that held me spellbound from the moment I heard my first Enya track (Boadicea) on a radio program called Music from the Hearts of Space: Beautiful use of electronic keyboards. Beautiful songs varying in nature from upbeat ditties to the most heartbreakingly haunting ballads. And, of course, that beautiful, angelic voice, used as a solo instrument unto itself and multi-tracked into the most heavenly of choirs...I'd never heard an artist use her voice in that manner since the days of Jon Anderson, both as a vocalist with Yes and a collaborator with Vangelis. That formula, probably to no one's surprise, thrives and survives on Amarantine. To be honest and fair, the previously alluded-to cynics & naysayers will sigh and say, \\"...just another Enya disc.\\" Let them say what they will. Dedicated Enya fans such as myself will, I am certain, LOVE this new recording and sing its praises for years to come.<br /><br />The opening track, Less Than A Pearl, is a classic opening Enya track, with a majestic chorus of \\"Ahhh's\\" that will have you singing along with her immediately. The title piece: there's the hit single formula again, with the pizzicato electronic strings and the typical light melody--sure to be another in her string of hits & instantly likeable. It's In The Rain: a wistful waltz-tempo piece that does, indeed, sound as if it could have come from her previous disc. If I Could Be Where You Are: the first of the meditative ballads we've come to love (a la \\"On Your Shore\\") wherein she sings of missing her loved one terribly. This, speaking for myself, is the main thing I've come to love Enya's music for...her unique gift of balladry. The River Sings is an uptempo track with percussion that lifts us from the pangs of the previous track into realms of joy & spiritual bliss. Long Long Journey: A midtempo song reminding us of the pain of being away from all we know and love coupled with the certain optimism of knowing we'll be home soon...somewhere we've all been. Sumiregusa (Wild Violet): Enya's first excursion into Japanese poetry and a truly beautiful meditation in every way possible. Someone Said Goodbye: This is turning into one of my favorite tracks so far, and I'm guessing it could be her second single. It has a relaxing, almost swing tempo to it in a lighthearted-approach that belies yet another exploration of the sadness & complications involved in loving another human being. A Moment Lost: Another ballad telling of the regrets involved in the ending of a relationship, taking the not-very-often approached path of showing admiration for the now former object of our affection (\\"How strong, how brave, how true of you to bear the hurt I gave. I know it tears your heart in two; all I've said, all I say to you.\\") Wow. Drifting: One of Enya's classic instrumentals, sad & wistful with the addition of some nice cello sounds to round out the piano & synths...could have served as the opening track to the CD as well. Amid The Falling Snow: A reminiscence of childhood, gazing out the window and watching the beauty of a silent snowfall, this track could pass as a nice addition to a Christmas collection as well. Very nice. And finally, Water Shows The Hidden Heart: A fitting closing piece, in slow waltz-tempo, & one of 3 tracks in which Enya sings in Roma Ryan's \\"Loxian\\" language from her book of the same title. Very pleasant sounding language it is, too. It's nice to hear Enya cascading her voices one over the other toward the final section of the song, too, giving it a madrigal, chamber choir-type of atmosphere & bringing the CD to a soft, understated & yet confident-feeling conclusion.<br /><br />Yes, the musical purists will berate this as just another Enya recording...but it bears repeating: For those of us who love her music, WHO CARES? Speaking for myself, I like this a little better than A DAY WITHOUT RAIN, and it's nice to see it clocking in at longer than that previous recording as well (45:34). I'm not insensitive to others' criticisms of Enya's formula--I, too, would like to see her try other things, since it's obvious she has talent coming out of her fingertips. Maybe a duet album with her sister Maire of Clannad. Maybe a recording wherein she employs a traditional band of guitar, bass & drums. Maybe a recording of her strictly unplugged...perhaps with piano, flute, acoustic guitar, harp (are you reading this, Andreas?), and her single voice. A live in concert CD and DVD, which I'm certain most of us have been clamoring for for years (Enya has spoken of touring in the past, but so far this hasn't materialized). Maybe a collaboration with other new age luminaries like Vangelis or Andreas Vollenweider. The possibilities are endless. But wherever Enya chooses to take her life and career, as long as she holds onto her indomitable spirit (especially in light of recent traumas she's been through involving deranged fans) and her obvious love for the music she creates, she will always have a place in the pantheon of musicians who make what we all know to be quality new age music. Her songs continue to have the healing Balm of Gilead effect on most who hear her music, and in an age of increasing tension and violence in a world with a tenuous future, we can be thankful for that. There will never be such a thing as The Perfect Musician, but I feel safe in saying that Enya strives for that perfection in every way possible and to the best of her ability. The bottom line: All Enya fans will love this stunning new CD. Those new to Enya's music may feel comfortable using this CD as a springboard and then explore her other releases eventually. She has yet to put out a \\"bad\\" album, and I don't see that ever happening at any point in her future. Carry on, Enya...you're doing fine, and we're glad to be along for the ride.it a madrigal, chamber choir-type of atmosphere & bringing the CD to a soft, understated & yet confident-feeling conclusion.

B000660UN0|1.0|Will someone just tell him no in the studio and force him to put on a Gibson, plug it into a Marshall for him, and make him do something worth buying.  Eric, you're not Robert Johnson and you won't ever be.  You were cool many years ago at being you.  This guy needs to work with a producer that will make him do something that resembles a rock n' roll album and quit letting him make these pointless records.   <br /> <br />If this gets a young person to check out Robert Johnson then that's great because we all need to get there at some point, but he's been milking this stuff for way too long.  I was introduced to so many cool things by reading interviews of what infuenced him and what he liked playing, but c'mon.   <br /> <br />You can have Clapton covered by buying Cream, Blind Faith, and the Timepieces album which is a greatest hits collection of his 70's stuff.  Ignore these stupid attempts to get grammys and milk old blues tunes.

B0002O06N0|5.0|I don't care what anyone says about these guys or who they try to compare them to.  They just always deliver and write great songs.  They know how to put together a record and get interesting tones, but keep it raw and energetic.  I listen to this album on every road trip and every mixed cd I make has one of the songs off this album.  Check them out live!
B000AL730O|3.0|I'll admit, I was fully prepared to hate this album. Paul McCartney is a musical god, a personal hero, a Beatle. But, as has been stated over and over, his solo output has been mixed at best. On first listen, it was nice to hear he'd gotten back to melody and hooks and given up the 12 bar rockers (uugh), but with all the prejudice I brought to the album I hated it right off the bat. Trite lyrics and it sounded like he was being influenced by bands who themselves were influenced by the Beatles. And so I left it at that.    Recently however, I pulled the album back out for reconsideration still wanting to like it despite myself, and after a few days of really listening... I do.     I still say the lyrics are a little too heart-on-my-sleeve sincere for my tastes but i can't expect \\"She Came in Through the Bathroom Window\\" and that's the important thing to take away from all this.     Taken on it's own merit, sans any preconceived hopes and wishes for long lost Beatles songs, this is a really good album.     And I'm so so pleased he made the decision to play all the instruments himself this time. It reveals as honest a musical effort as i have heard from McCartney. And it's definitely his most consistent album in at least decade, probably longer.    But take this album for what it is. \\"Jenny Wren\\" is NOT Blackbird no matter how many reviews state that. But that's okay because nothing ever will be. This album is, however, a real musical offering from the man who invented it all.
0739308742|3.0|While John Lee does an adequate job, and in other ciscumstances I'd say a pretty good job, he suffers in comparison to Roy Dotrice, who read the first three unabridged audio books in this series. Roy Dotrice was a master who was perfecectly suited to the material. I read the first book and listened to the aduio as well and Roy Dotrices interpretation brought depth to the characters that I never imagined myself, in addition his unique performance of each character helped me keep them all separate, which is very important in this series. Unfortunately for John Lee he is forced to stick with the conventions Roy used for some of the major characters but his take seems flat compared to Roy. If the decision to replace Roy Dotrice with John Lee was a financial one, it was no bargain.

B000BKDOCA|5.0|I have loved Britney Spears since she's made her debut in 1999. I have followed her and supported her ever since.  I have TONS of CD's with nothing but remixes and un-released songs.  This one is probably by far the BEST I own.  I was hoping there'd be a remix of some sort of the HOT dance song \\"Guilty\\" that was never released.  For anyone who is a hardcore britney fanatic as myself this album is a MUST HAVE for your collection.  For the others who just like what she puts out this album really wouldn't be a need to have.  However, I RECOMEND IT!!!
B0007Y08IS|3.0|I am a big fan of South Park, so when I heard about this movie coming out I was going to order it but never got around to it, I finally watched it and it was  really funny up until a few parts, If they wouldve taken out 3 parts this movie wouldve kicked a**. but they just took it to far, some parts were really nasty and they werent even nessecary, and swearing every sentence can be funny in a T.V show sometimes but in movies it just gets old, my advice would be to buy an edited version if it came out for this movie
B0007OASII|5.0|The so called melodic power metal is a 'genre' that I didn't stand much because usually the bands sound formulaic and cheesy. <br /> <br />Well, I just discovered Kamelot recently and by accident. I had heard of them before but didn't pay much attention because I thought they were just another of these melodic metal bands. How wrong I was! <br /> <br />Let me just say that I am a big fan of Iron Maiden and Queensryche and had lost interest in metal music since the 90s but now I can't stop listening to Kamelot's The Black Halo, Epica and Karma CDs. Some of their speedier music reminds me a bit of Iron Maiden, but most of the time they remind me of a progressive Queenryche. They're some kind of 'progressive melodic power metal band'. <br /> <br />Their sound is melodic but not cheesy (incredible but true), they're terrific musicians and excellent songwriters. And they sound like a real band and not some kind of vehicle for a overwhelming vocalist, guitar or keyboard player (you know what I mean). <br /> <br />Just listen to Karma, Epica and The Black Halo and become a fan. (I hear the older CDs are good but they're hard to find here in Brazil). <br /> <br />You can also go to the band's website and watch the amazing 'March of Mephisto' and 'The Haunting' videos!
B000BYY0RY|5.0|From the moment Kylie begins her concert with what is widely considered to be Kylie's biggest song ever (well everywhere but America) Better The Devil You Know to the last encore song of Love At First Sight Kylie shows us why she is the ultimate Showgirl. <br /> <br />Her concerts are what concerts should be all about.  Fun, fun, fun!  <br /> <br />I had seen Kylie before for here Fever tour, which was incredible and on my top five concerts of all time. <br /> <br />Kylie Showgirl was worth the 12 hour flight to London from Houston, 2 hours of sleep, 4 hour train ride to Manchester, where as soon as she came out I was no longer tired! <br /> <br />My favorite part of the concert is the Smiley Kylie part.  Great 17 minute medley that begins with Shocked and ends with Spinning Around. <br /> <br />And the projections!  So fun!  Smiley Kylie's are the best, they are made to look like covers of UK magazine ID.  And the lyrics are projected to appear to be part of the magazine cover.  The ID logo is replaced by KM2, just incredible. <br /> <br />And then there is the male dancer \\"shower\\" scene, where they start off in the shower and then put on jeans only and dance to Red Blooded Woman. <br /> <br />Other stand outs: I Believe In You, Hand On Your Heart, Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi, Come Into My World, On A Night Like This. <br /> <br />Highly recommended, Kylie has made the transition from pop princess to Pop Queen on this concert. <br /> <br />Also noted, Kylie had to cancel her tour shortly after this concert was filmed, so clearly she was not feeling well when the concert was filmed, but you cannot tell at all, it seems like Kylie' opening night even though the show that was filme was the last of her 7 London concerts. <br /> <br />Get well soon Kylie!   <br />
B000BM6AVA|5.0|I have to admit; on first listen I didn't like this album as much as Mezmerize. Whereas Mezmerize as a whole is more upbeat and angry, with its blatant political messages, Hypnotize strikes me more as an introspective, more melancholy cd.     <br /> <br />On subsequent listens, however, I'm starting to enjoy Hypnotize more. It's more melodic and less aggressive, so it's more of a Spiders-side of SOAD than a Jet Pilot side, in fact one of my friends said that they song Hypnotize sounds like it could be on a Disney soundtrack if it didn't have the vocals and the drums (not sure I agree, but the instrumentation is....interesting...)  <br /> <br />Overall, I think it's a different emphasis for System than the last cd with its furious speed in songs like BYOB and happy pep in Radio/Video, but they've always shown this frenetic/brooding duality, and it makes their music stronger. Serj and Daron continue to share the mike, but I think Serj dominates a little more on this effort than on the last one, which I personally prefer (though Daron's the man too, don't get me wrong...).  My personal favorites are Dreaming, Attack, and U-Fig...and of course, the song I'm referencing in the title: Vicinity of Obscenity. WARNING, however! This song WILL get stuck in your head, guaranteed! You may in fact find yourself receiving strange looks from people as you look at them and mutter the infectious chorus...for the next two weeks! Careful not to get maced!
B000000W5L|5.0|Simply the best Rock n Roll Album ever made. Why? It combines every important style of great music that came before and after it.  Despite rather poor work by the producer, it stands miles above everything else released before and up to this time in my option. The more you listen to it the better it gets. This Album should be in every serious rock music collection. 100 Stars
B000B8QEZG|1.0|I came to amazon.com to read the reviews of Madonna's new album fully expecting scathing put-downs.  I was so surprised to find a majority of 5-star glorifications here.  I was barely able to play through the cd so unchanging was the beat, so mundane were the lyrics, so devoid of melody was the music and so unimaginative were the chord changes.  I'm amazed so many people could tell enough difference between the songs to review them separately.  I'm even gay and I hated it. I was not inspired to dance and that takes a lot.  A pounding disco beat with nothing else to offer has never been inspiration enough for me to dance and I love to dance and have done so for many years in gay clubs.  (Ray of Light has been one of my favorite dance songs.)  One needs a little funk and complexity of rhythm, a soaring, catchy melody, a creative bass line, none of which exist in this album.  Just boring and nothing that stimulates.  [...]

B000001F76|5.0|Believe it or not I purchased my copy of \\"Hank Williams: 40 Greatest Hits\\" when it was first released as a 2 LP set way back in 1978.  I was not a big fan of country music in those days but I had heard and read enough about the man to know that he had played an important role in the history of American popular music. Even then I was sure that this was a collection worth owning.<br /><br />Hank Williams meteoric rise to stardom began in Montgomery, Alabama as a high school student in the late 1930's.  Known as \\"The Singing Kid\\" Hank hosted his very own radio show on radio station WSFA.  Before long he would put together a backup band known as the Drifting Cowboys and the group began showing up in roadhouses, auditoriums and juke joints all over the region. From a very early age it was quite apparent that this young man had an awful lot of talent.  However, Hank Williams' personal life was a mess.  His father Lon virtually abandoned the family when Hank was very young.  Hank's mom was extremely overbearing and by the age of 11 or 12 Hank had developed a taste for liquor.  The scourge of alcoholism would plague him for the rest of his days. He would marry Audrey in 1944 and in many ways the marriage would become yet another source of unhappiness in young Hank's life.  But in spite of it all this extremely gifted singer-songwriter was bound and determined to make his mark in country music.<br /><br />The man who would come to be known as \\"the father of country music\\" signed on with the fledgling M-G-M label in 1947.  After a couple of near misses \\"Lovesick Blues\\" was the surprise hit of 1949.  Despite objections from all of his handlers Hank insisted on releasing it as a single.  He obviously knew what he was doing because the song spent an amazing 16 weeks at the top of the country charts.  The monumental success of \\"Lovesick Blues\\" would earn Hank a spot on the brand new radio program \\"Louisiana Hayride\\".  Could the Grand Ole Opry be far behind?  Later on in 1949 Hank would have two more huge hits with \\"Wedding Bells\\" and \\"Mind Your Own Business\\".  Now there was just no question about it.  Hank Williams was invited to join the Grand Old Opry. Hank Williams was now more popular than ever.  He seemed to strike a chord with the record buying public. And the hits just kept on coming.  In spite of the overwhelming personal problems that would eventually cost him his health, his marriage and his spot on the Opry,  Hank would remain a fixture on the country charts with fabulous tunes like \\"Cold Cold Heart\\", \\"Long Gone Lonesome Blues\\" and of course \\"Your Cheatin' Heart\\".  You could hear all of that pain in his voice. During his relatively brief recording career Hank Williams would record just 66 sides. He wrote 50 of them.  Unfortunately the life of Hank Williams was all too brief.  He passed away in the back seat of a car on New Years Day 1953 at the age of 29.<br /><br />\\"Hank Williams: 40 Greatest Hits\\" is a celebration of the music of this true American original. His lyrics will move you and his vocals will haunt you.  Listen carefully to these tunes and you will come to appreciate what a truly remarkable talent this man was.  These are all the original M-G-M studio recordings. Beware of some collections that include some inferior \\"live\\" recordings.  For my money, \\"40 Greatest Hits\\" remains to this day the finest Hank Williams collection ever issued.  Highly recommended!!!would have two more huge hits with \\"Wedding Bells\\" and \\"Mind Your Own Business\\".  Now there was just no question about it.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna never ceases to amaze me every album is a shocker ! And what amazes me the most is how much effort and creativity goes into her lp's! Even at the age she is now she is still fluent ! I have been amazed with this woman every since 1994's \\"Bedtime Stories\\" and she hasn't disappointed since! This album has some amazing dance songs on it ! \\"Get together\\" is just simply beautiful ! Reminds me of \\"Music sounds better with you\\" but abit more elegant! \\"Sorry\\" is just a tight cruzing night time track with another amazing beat. \\"I love New York\\" the guitar in it puts you in the mind of some electronic funk ! \\"Forbidden Love\\" is a futuristic love song . \\"Like it or not' puts me in the mind of something off or \\"American Life\\". I have really  no complaints on this album, it is a very complex work like all of her other efforts. But i will say that I liked American Life better only because I felt it was more diverse. This is diverse for the genre it is in ! Because it is extremley hard to make a unusual or diverse dance lp, that keeps interest. Most dance lps are often redundant or have one or two decent songs. She managed to do a dance lp that all the songs have there own unique sound. The beginning of each song has a extremley creative introduction that holds your attention. It is almost like you know the boom is about to hit. This is a 5 star album and I think \\"American Life\\" was ahead of its time that is why she chose to do a dance lp this time. \\"American life\\" was simply Amazing the beats were just futurictic and extremley different and the lyrics were real! Also the beats were harder and they were looped with accoustic electric guitars. Definitley check that album if you like this. Songs like \\"Hollywood\\" are missed on this lp greatly. <br /> <br />A+

B000AA4M9U|5.0|You would never believe that B.B. King was 80 if all you had to go on was this CD.  There are some really great pairings.  He does a great version of \\"The Thrill Is Gone\\" with Eric Clapton.  Billy Gibbons blends well with King on \\"Tired Of Your Jive\\".  Sheryl Crow, Gloria Estefan, and Van Morrison also do a good job with King.  However, the tracks with Roger Daltry and Glenn Frey keep this from being a five star CD.  The tracks with these guys show a complete lack of chemistry.  At the end of the day, though, this is a very enjoyable CD.  I recommend it to anyone who likes B.B. King.

B000BKDOCA|5.0|This is a great remixes album. I think all of Britney's fan had been waiting for this CD for a really long time. It's kind of disappointing that it has very few tracks... It should have been a 2-cd album  but oh well... it's still good. \\"And then we kiss\\" is the brand new song and it's AWESOME! it has a good beat and it's very sexy but innocent at the same time. The remixes for \\"Toxic\\", \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\", \\"Touch of my hand\\" and \\"Early Morning\\" are the best I've heard. I wish they would have remixed \\"Everytime\\" \\"Baby one more time\\" & \\"Someday\\" again because the versions in this album were released before on the singles. \\"Me against the music\\" has a new beat and it's very catchy. Of course we can't forget about \\"Don't let me be the last to know\\" with this new beat and I just think that \\"Breathe on me\\" could have been a hot remix if it were different. I like the original version better. I think they should have include \\"Over to you now\\" cuz it has a very good beat and they also forgot about \\"Do Somethin'\\" \\"My Prerogative\\" and so many other great songs. Overall it's a GREAT ALBUM and every Britney fan must have it!
B000BJS4SU|4.0|John Mayer exploded on the scene a couple years ago with acoustic driven pop songs like No Such Thing, which catapulted him to James Taylor of the 21st Century status and landing him in every co-ed's music collection.  Each song on Room for Squares was well crafted pop song but if you caught him in concerts or at the very least head his live album Any Given Thursday, he yearned for a little more than your garden variety TRL acts with more bluesy versions of songs and Dave Matthew Band type jams.  That transition continued with the more experimental Heavier Things that had a few straight up blues songs on it.  Mayer recently completed his transformation into a blues artist when he dumped his touring band and repackaged himself as the John Mayer Trio with Steve Jordan on drums and Pino Palladino on bass with the group channeled the power trios of the past such as Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience. <br /> <br />The live album starts off with How Did You Think I Was with a riff so raw all the car companies are probably clambering as you read this to put it in their commercials even if it sound like a Lenny Kravitz riff, to be specific, Always on the Run.  The lyrics sound as if they were a retort to anyone who questioned Mayer's credibility, \\"Am I the one who plays the quiet songs?  Is he the one who turns the ladies on?\\"  But even with the power trio, Mayer can't seem to get away from his lovelorn lyrics that populate his previous albums like on Good Love Is on the Way.  And Mayer goes a little too far when he intros Out of Mind by joking the home of the blues is in Connecticut.  You can even hear his band roll their eyes when he says this. <br /> <br />No concert is complete without a cover song or two.  On Try the trio runs through the Hendrix gem Wait Till Tomorrow.  But the musicians truly gel for a funky version Ray Charles' I Got a Woman.  If you listen closely you can even hear Mayer emulate Kanye West's Gold Digger, which samples the Charles classic, with his guitar.  But when Mayer starts to sing, he ends up like sounding like he's imitating Jamie Foxx imitating Ray Charles.  The song was supposed to close out the show, but anyone who has ever been to a concert, there's going to be an encore where people cheer for one or no.  So after the prerequisite wait, Mayer and crew comes out and go through bluesier versions of song off of his last album, Daughters and Something's Missing, the later slips back to his teen idol self with the call and response with the \\"checks\\" at the end of the song.
B000AL730O|2.0|To be fair, I never compare solo work by Lennon or McCartney to their work together; it's apples and oranges. <br /> <br />So this one sounds a lot like other ones Sir Paul has turned out over the years.  Tug of War remains my fave. <br /> <br />Can't say I'd buy this one if I were you.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|That's what it boils down to, really: it's about damned time she decided to burn the world's discos out again. American Life wasn't just a commercial failure, it out-and-out sucked, was Madonna's worst full-length in-well, ever. She'd gotten too self-important, was doing what we thought she'd never do, seemingly believing her own press. The fun was missing, replaced by what-wack rapping, rhyming \\"lattes\\" and \\"pilates\\"? There was a slight stench of inevitability to it, like we knew it couldn't last forever but we couldn't help hoping against hope anyway.  <br /> <br />Just like that, though, she's back, and not just back, but reminding us that we can still dance, for inspiration. Thank God, by whom (in this case) I mean Stuart Price, a/k/a the Thin White Duke, a/k/a Les Rhythmes Digitales, a/k/a our savior of our lady Madonna in the year 2005. Apparently, Mrs. Ritchie's recently been reminded of how much she loves dance music, reportedly thanks to the remixes she commissions with each single release. Word is that she thus wanted her new album to be one giant throb, no let up, no ballads, just pure uncut dance music. As it was before, so shall it be again.  <br /> <br />Confessions on a Dance Floor is Madonna's most purely beat-driven album since her self-titled 1983 debut. (Erotica may have been a down-and-dirty club record, but it still included the likes of \\"Rain.\\") Price fills the Reggie Lucas role here, and like Lucas did so long ago, he helps Madonna make pop that pops like yeast bubbles in fresh bread dough, spiced with peppermint extract. \\"Physical Attraction\\" and \\"Burning Up\\" were perfectly of their moment and transcended it too, sleazy pop records designed for sweaty up-all-night dancing. \\"Sorry\\" and \\"Hung Up\\" may not be as sleazy (or sleazy at all) but have the same basic modus operandi, and do it just as well as her now-over-20-years-old singles did.  <br /> <br />There hasn't been another Madonna album that references so much music by other people. The bassline of \\"Future Lovers\\" (the album's weakest track, due largely I think to the hand of old-and-in-the-way co-producer Mirwais-and did I mention that Madonna co-produced the entire album?) is clearly cribbed from \\"I Feel Love,\\" while in an odd juxtaposition, the next track, \\"I Love New York\\" (good music, facile lyrics) takes its bassline from the Joy Division catalog. Of course, there's the brilliant ABBA sample leading the brilliant-or-something-close-to-it \\"Hung Up\\" (from \\"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!\\") as well, and nearly the whole of \\"Jump\\" sounds to these ears like a Pet Shop Boys homage. It's always been clear that Madonna's a music lover, but it's nice to see evidence that she's a fan, too, hearing her quote and crib and steal-like great art does.  <br /> <br />Apart from the aforementioned Mirwais contribution, the only other tracks not produced with Price are a pair done with Swedish popmasters Bloodshy & Avant (they did Britney's \\"Toxic,\\" need I go on?). Plucky closer \\"Like It Or Not\\" is good (its garden of Eden references are delightful), but it's \\"How High\\" that's the knockout, an electropop throb like an intense migraine-only, y'know, a good one-sweetened with symphonic stabs. It's followed by the Hasidic throwdown \\"Isaac,\\" akin to \\"Don't Tell Me\\" if that hit hadn't been so wimpy-wimpy-wimpy, and had taken Jewish mysticism (um, I think) as its subject.  <br /> <br />Lyrics have never really been Madonna's strong point, and her Confessions are [sic] no different. But with this album like no album of hers in quite some time, the point here is the groove; this album finds one, locks in, and works it relentlessly, like Madonna herself did Willem Dafoe in Body of Evidence. Easily her finest effort since Ray of Light, I guess this means that English country living's doing her a world of good. This is one Dance Floor whose pull is irresistible.  <br /> <br />STYLUSMAGAZINE.COM'S ALBUM OF THE WEEK: NOVEMBER 21 - NOVEMBER 27, 2005  <br />Reviewed by: Thomas Inskeep <br/>Reviewed on: 2005-11-21  <br /> <br />
B0009YCP1Y|4.0|As always, anything that MK does is great.  The only new track, however,  on this cd is from the upcoming release with Emmylou Harris, and it brings out the best in both of them.  The other 21 tracks can all be found on other releases by DS and MK.  Nevertheless, it is nice to have these outstanding recordings gathered onto one collection.   The short critical essay by Timothy Ferris is also a joy to read, not only for the information on MK (which most die-hard MK fans know already) but for the superb writing of TF himself.  The little book is a lovely glitzy production of TF's essay, photos spanning MK's career, and song lyrics. <br />HOWEVER, at $78 plus dollars the whole package is vastly overpriced.   Yes, I bought it, both for the TF essay and the packaging, but I would not recommend it at this price to anyone but the most devoted fans who want another collectible piece. Every MK fan has these tracks on other cds--or can buy the double cd without the glitz.  Patient fans can wait for the duet cd to be released.   Again,though,  not one negative criticism of MK, himself,  or TF would ever  escape my lips--or my keyboard.

0440238609|5.0|If I were to list my ten favorite books, \\"The Golden Compass\\" would be towards the top of that list. With each reading (an annual event) I am reminded of the beauty and mystery that is the fabric of this work. I think of it as a transcendent work in that it far exceeds the usual limits of this genre. Adolescent tales of magical worlds are understandably popular-the target audience is on the brink of enormous change and is feeling quite confined by the circumstances of their lives. Those other books are, however, generally limited to fairly superficial characterization and plots which, while often exciting, are really just aimed providing the reader with an emotionally cathartic experience. There is nothing wrong with that; but, as this trilogy shows, so much more is possible.     The \\"Dark Materials\\" Trilogy is a more solid work because it is dealing with essential truths of our life and the nature of existence. While it is a fantasy, it is quite realistic in its portrayal of what it means to be human. At the most accessible level this means that the characters are fully developed. They are consistently portrayed and feel real. They are fully human (even if they happen to be bears or witches!). More profoundly, though, is the feel of the world created in this book. We live in a world of beauty and mystery. For countless reasons, however, we are generally cut off from this aspect of our nature. In this work, however, you can get a feel for this part of the fabric of our being. From the opening scenes at the school or on the streets of Oxford, we feel our grasp on the ordinary world slipping. This is our world-almost. These real people in this slightly altered time and place create a world of wonder. It is as though you looking at the unfolding of events through a shimmering silky black fog. It is not only mysterious in the sense of plot development, but also in the more profound way as we, through Lyra's eyes, let go of our firm holding of our ideas of how things should be.     Some reviewers and readers are concerned about an anti-religious tone they see in these books. While there is some questioning of the worst of organized religion, the work is, in a deeper sense, a support to a spiritual life. These books help us connect with a sense of awe and wonder about the world. By bringing us into contact with that sense of mystery, they bring us closer the divine that is within everything.
B00005JNQS|4.0|David vs Goliath-type films are always fun. Multiple Oscar contenders are on hand to give great voice to some very good characters. The totally CGI film is wonderful to watch and experience, and is a great family film. Robin Williams is kept in control, as necessary, and Ewan McGregor and Halle Berry carry the lead roles well, and Jim Broadnent should be given credit for the nastiest of nasty persons, with fine support from Greg Kinnear. Expect the non-human jokes, which are all clever. Mel Brooks, Jennifer Coolidge, Amanda Bynes and Drew Carey add to the fun.  I won't blab away the plot, but this is fun and worth a look.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|I've been listening to SOAD since I first heard \\"Chop Suey!\\" on the radio four years ago. They became my absolute favorite band, and nothing's changed since, especially with the release of their double album. Mezmerize/Hypnotize is my favorite album of theirs. Describing SOAD is a very hard thing to do, as well as how I feel when I listen to them. I have never experienced chills while listening to an entire album like I have with SOAD albums.  <br /> <br />Everyone of their albums are excellent from beginning to end. So many emotions are conveyed in thier music, at times it can be very moving. At one moment they could be screaming at the top of their lungs, and then beautifully harmonizing the next. You never know what to expect when listening to the songs for the first time. With Mezmerize/Hyponotize, you can hear just how much they have matured artistically since thier self titled album, which was still equally great.  <br /> <br />The case itself is very cool. You can connect the two albums together, forming one case, with the art in the case connecting as well. I'm so glad that they did split the album in two, we get more songs than they've ever released in one album, which is what Mezmerize/Hypnotize really is. I truly love this album, and I've only had it in my hands for less than four hours. <br /> <br />I love how Hynopotize ends with Soldier Side, where Mezmerize began with Soldier Side(Intro). It all comes together beautifully. The highlights of this album I would say are...oh who am I kidding? The whole album is a highlight. The only one I'm not sure about is She's Like Heroin, but like with all their album's, some songs take time to really get. As far as I'm concerned, Mezmerize/Hypnotize is a classic.
B000002897|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS EVER CREATED. ALONG WITH DUST THEIR SECOND ALBUM; THIS IS TRUELY ONE OF THE BEST BANDS OF ALL TIME. MUICALLY? GENIUS. MARK IS A FENOMINAL VOCALIST WITH HAUNTING VOCAL MELODIES AND A BAND THAT CREATES OUTSTANDING GROOVES TO BACK IT UP. SIMPLY AMAZING!
0553801503|3.0|Let me begin by saying I loved the first three books of the series and I think George R.R. Martin is the best fantasy writer out right now.  However, I'm gonna have to give it to you 'Ser Davos Seaworth' style Mr. Martin--nothing less than the blunt honest truth.  <br /> <br />'Feast'is a dissapointment for the following reasons: <br /> <br />1.  Some of the most popular and interesting characters are missing.  Sure, you told us they would be missing, but we thought they would be replaced with equally interesting characters.  Brienne, the Oakheart guy, and Aaron Greyjoy?!?!  The new characters are boring, uninspiring, and just plain deadweight that should \\"Take-The-Black\\" or something. <br /> <br />2.  Nothing happens in the book.  There is not one significant event that happens in 'Feast' that you could reference in a later book, i.e., 'The Red Wedding', 'The Battle At Whispering Wood', 'The Death Of Karl Drogo', or 'The Trial Of Tyrianne Lannister 1&2'.  In 'Feast', I can't reference ANYTHING that happened.  It's just a bunch of scheming and re-scheming, and walking around looking for stuff and self-pity!  Don't give me every detail and angle of a scheme that is never gonna happen! <br /> <br />3.  Scope.  I know this sounds weird, but why do I get the feeling that this series will not end until Martin gives every house, clan, dragon, free-folk, wildling, snark, and grumpkin their own Point-Of-View character?  In the first three books, Martin lays out the major characters and sets up the major locales of action.  'Feast' pretty much abandons that and  takes us to new places with new characters.  It's the equivalent of taking Frodo and Sam out of \\"The Return Of The King\\" and instead telling the story of Bilbo Baggins!  I feel like the series may be losing focus and we're gonna end up with a \\"Wheel of Time\\" on our hands. <br /> <br />4.  Did I say that nothing happens in the book? <br /> <br />5.  Is he using this book as a setup for the rest of the series?  Maybe.But each book in the series so far has been able to stand on it's own as far as quality; not just as a good addition to the series, but as a good cover-to-cover story.  'Feast' cannot do that.  If there were a literary contest where an author had to submit his best book, 'Feast' would unanimously not be chosen by anyone.  It's below GRRM standards. <br /> <br />So there you go Mr. Martin.  An honest opinion.
B000002HFU|4.0|After being led into the 36 Chambers by Wu-Tang Clan, Ol' Dirty Bastard releases his debut solo Return To The 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version that doesn't veer too far away from the group's agenda.  The RZA held down eleven of the seventeen tracks and O.D.B. even contributed with three tracks of his own.  \\"Shimmy Shimmy Ya\\" is the first song to lead this LP off with a one key chord melody to fit the orthodox flow of Ol' Dirty.  What make's \\"Baby C'mon\\" is the two tone track changed right at the perfect time.  He represents and challenges competitors on \\"Brooklyn Zoo\\".  For a more classic hip-hop feel on \\"Hippa To Da Hoppa\\" with a piano touch.  For those who want a classic Wu-Tang tune, \\"Raw Hide\\" featuring Method Man & Raekwon over a sinister loop with memorable lyrics \\"...so I gotta get paid fully / weather it's truthfully / or untruthfully...\\"  \\"Damage\\" featuring Genius/GZA they awkwardly tag team for a good combination.  Some of his comedic efforts show on \\"Don't U Know\\" as he flows about being in school trying to get with a girl.  The plain and simple \\"The Stomp\\" is another song which displays the overall characteristics as there's different faces of rhyme styles as does \\"Goin' Down\\".  \\"Snakes\\" featuring Killer Priest, The RZA, Master Killer & Buddah Monk is a good song for the different styles and stories as done on the up-tempo \\"Proteck Ya Neck II The Zoo\\" featuring Buddah Monk, Prodigal Sun, Zoo Keeper, Murdoc, Killer Priest, 12 O'clock, Shorty Sh*t Stain & 60 Second Assassin.  \\"Dirty Dancin'\\" featuring Method Man throws the album to another level over a looped bass.  To close off on a high note with another off-beat song, \\"Harlem World\\" adds to the intensity of this effort as a whole.  R.I.P.
B000BKJ78K|1.0|Well my question to everyone is: What about the COMPLETE triology?  Christmas is coming up and all the movies have been released so instead of making a copy of the triology that was released last year, why not make the complete triology of all the movies?  Sure it'd be expensive, but that's what i've been waiting for!  Does anyone have any news on whether Lucas is thinking of doing this anytime soon?  Or is he just going to try to make more money on releasing things that have already been done?
B00005QVHA|5.0|Originally unleashed in 1973, as this was the Stooge's third effort. Who hasn't at least owned a cassette copy of this title at one time or another? I mean, it SEEMS that if you lived in the city, you were practically issued a copy. Tracks that stood out in my mind were the power-house \\"Search & Destroy\\" (I do not care for when almost ANY other performer covers this tune-no one does it like Iggy), the blistering \\"Your Pretty Face Is Going To Hell\\", the title cut \\"Raw Power\\" and the rocking \\"I Need Somebody\\" (like THIS tune when others play it). Outstanding proto-punk, Detroit style. A must-have.
B000BKDOCA|5.0|Good remix album!! The new track \\"And Then We Kiss\\" is worth the price of the album alone. Hopefully she continues in this vein of music. Overall a good collection of some of her best remixes. Highlights include mixes of \\"Toxic\\", \\"Baby One More time\\", \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\", and more. Remix fans and Britney fans alike will enjoy this set of remixes.
B000065TQR|5.0|Originally released in early 1971, this was the stunning debut record by the Pink Fairies. Nice job on the reissue, comes with a 16-page full color informative CD booklet - packed with rarely seen artwork and memorabilia (like many Hawkwind CD reissues have). Includes two of the Fairie's best known cuts, the single \\"Do It\\" and the somewhat infamous ten-minute \\"Uncle Harry's Last Freakout\\". But it certainly doesn't stop there, other worthy tracks include \\"Teenage Rebel\\", the R&B-like \\"War Girl\\" and the title track \\"Never Never Land\\". Noticed the sound of this CD reissue appears to be quite polished, more so than one might expect. Makes for a great listening piece on a late weekend night. Plus, Polydor tags on four (4) bonus tunes that are alternate edits to some of the tunes I just mentioned. Basically, just great guitar-driven psych / garage rock & roll, that to me is a life long keeper. Recommended.
B000BM6AVA|3.0|Perhaps the worst thing for this release was that it was peranently fated to be compared to it's stellar predecessor, \\"Mezmerize\\". Although \\"Hypnotize\\" has it's strong points, dammit, it's just not as fun.     Some of the afforementioned strong points include \\"Dreaming\\", \\"Tentative\\", \\"Holy Mountains\\" (This song has been around for ages), the title track, and lead single \\"Hypnotize\\". \\"Vicinity of Obscenity\\" however, is the only song on the record that really demonstrates that great ADHD psychosis unique to System Of A Down. A song that effortlesly fuses a porn-style funk verse with a delightfully insane hook (Banana Banana Banana terracotta pie!), and is complimented with the sort of Nutty delivery that Serj, and only Serj can bring us.    And then there's Soldier Side. The sad, melodic intro that opens Mezmerize is presented in it's entirety to close Hypnotize, bringing the musical content of the two records full-circle, only this time around Serj and Daron drop the hook full force over the grandiose accompaniement of distorted guitars and... Mandolins? This is a spectaular track, and by far the best on the album, as it wound to a close, It made me want to take Hypnotize out and put Mezmerize back in...    Which brings me onto the record's not so strong points. Musically, it's pretty much exactly what we've come to expect from SOAD. They Juxtapose soft harmonies and hard, catchy choruses with ease, and recruit unusual instruments into their arrangenents making for compelling musical synergy, particularly for this genre. My problem however, is that much of the psychotic flair and rabid energy so prominent on Mezmerize is largely absent here. What we have instead is an album that favours sombre melodies and thrashing that occaisionally seems uncreative and, well, boring... In addition to this a few of the songs are kinda samey, and \\"Lonely Day\\" comes off a bit sappy...    As a free-standing work, I'd give this album 3.5 stars (If Amazon was half star compatible). Coupled with the 5 star Mezmerize I'd give the set a 4.5, as Hypnotize makes more sense this way. It's a Good release that has great moments, but overall just is not as exciting as some of their other works...
B000BEZPQE|5.0|Usually im scared of buying live cds because sometimes the sound quality sucks or the band just flat out sucks live. Well that isnt the case with Slipknot 9.0 Live this CD is amazing. You can literally feel the energy surging through your speakers. The CD covers basicly a whole Slipknot concert even Joey's famous Drum solo and the infamous 'jump the f*** up'. The CD even has the rare song Purity on it. If you dont have this you MUST get it. Its a must have for any maggot!
B000BKDOCA|5.0|This album has some of the best remixes of her best songs. The remixes bring new life to her songs and makes you like the ones you once hated. Here is how i rate each track <br /> <br />1. Toxic - 4/5 - it's good but quite long <br />2. Me against the music - 5/5 - i really like this remix, it isn't as heavy as the original and its really good <br />3. Touch of my hand - 5/5 - theres a lot of music before the singing but when it starts its really good <br />4. Breathe on me - 4/5 - its got a really funky beat, i like it <br />5. I'm a Slave 4 U - 4/5 - really fast and heavy its good though <br />6. And then we kiss - 5/5 - the only new track on the album, it's one of my favourites ever it has a nice beat and overall a great song. It would of been a hit if she realesed it <br />7. Everytime - 5/5 - this is a great remix it makes the song more upbeat <br />8. Early Mornin' - 5/5 - i like it better than the original, its not as dark and its fresher <br />9. Someday - 4/5 - its a great song and i love this remix <br />10. ...Baby one more time - 4/5 - another great one, similar to the slave remix but i havn't really listened to this one yet <br />11. Don't let me be... - 5/5 - this is really good, i never liked the original but this remix is great!
B00005JA2B|5.0|Carry On is definately the song that will get most people to buy this album.<br /><br />But there are several other songs that are amazing as well. To me, Miracles Out of Nowhere is right up there with Carry On for their best track on this album. It's complex, yet has just the right amount of straighforward rock to pull it all together. The rest of the songs are alright, but nothing special.<br /><br />So go buy it if you really want to, or just get \\"Device, Voice, Drum.\\" A greatest hits live album.
B0000009RT|5.0|Freak Out! is about a trillion, yes a trillion!, times better and original than anything produced by the biggest frauds in music history aka The Beatles. If we lived in a just world this would be on top of Rolling Stones Greatest Ever Album list.
0316776963|4.0|David Sedaris writes satirically about his life, all stories are true and unexaggerated.  He uses many different aspects of sarcasm in order to get the reader to laugh.  Also he will use techniques that get the reader to think the same way he is thinking.  Sedaris is very good at making his view or take on situations is the right one, and makes an extremely great argument for himself, whether or not he is actually right.  Irony is also used to make the story funnier.  He says he was offered the position as a teacher, when the preceding professor found a better job delivering pizza.  A pizza delivery boy is certainly not what would be considered a high-paying job, and therefore it is ironically funny that Sedaris is getting paid less than he would be for delivering pizzas. <br /> Sedaris will also describe many times the way he planned, or saw himself completing a task: always in a very distinguished manner.  But, then when he describes the way he actually accomplished the task, he is able to make fun of his awkward and uneasy ways of doing things.  People are able to easily relate themselves to the same types of awkward situations Sedaris describes.  As you read the book you might say, \\"I have totally felt that way before,\\" or \\"I never thought anyone would actually ever admit that.\\"  By stating the obvious, untold truth, David Sedaris is able to have a very unique humorous effect on his audience.   <br />        Many of the things Sedaris has done are almost entirely unbelievable to people, which adds to the comedic style.  Another aspect of Sedaris' writing that makes it so funny is that at the time he did all of these strange things, he was being totally serious, and now, as he looks back to write, it is entirely funny and he can make fun of himself.  Many people are able to relate this same type of thing to them.  Most times, people do something stupid, and in the long run can look back and see the laughter in it.  That is exactly what Sedaris does.
037571457X|4.0|Satrapi's Persepolis elevates the art of old comic books to a new literary height, capturing the author's childhood in a graphically gripping, and appropriately austere, documentary. While she opens the story feeling baffled by the symbolism of the scarf, she depicts herself as a precocious child reading Marx at the age of ten; wanting to become a prophet, a guerilla leader like Castro, Trotsky, and Che Guevarra; and a martyr in one breath. Given her privileged background--she describes her family as avant-garde, driving a Cadillac, employing a maid branded by her father as belonging to another class, and sending the teenage Satrapi to Vienna, after her education at the French academy in her native Teheran--one questions the poignancy of her childhood and her presumed childish insight into the Islamic Revolution. Yet, the memoir opens a new path to readers adverse to dry accounts of political events, its greatest gift.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|A recent article in The Washington Post so accurately assessed that System of a Down luckily, and yet, unintentionally, rode the coattails of the nu-metal era, though it cannot accurately be limited to the definition of nu-metal.  Indeed, with the near death of that obviously baseless sound, System of a Down, unlike Korn, Limp Bizkit, Mudvayne, etc., remains a Billboard behemoth because this Armenian foursome possesses a truly unique formula.<br /><br />The second half of its 2005 output, Hypnotize, to me, is much more of a logical step from Toxicity than the very good, yet still regressive, Mezmerize.  Where that album toyed with a more tempered and simplistic formula, Hypnotize is a lethal dose of aggression and mayhem filtered through a refreshing maturity in the songwriting department.<br /><br />Possibly throwing a middle finger to the critics who question the musicianship of the group, Hypnotize contains System of a Down's most impressive technical performance since its self-titled debut, hands down.  I mean, in no way has this become a technical band, but the songs are far more dynamic, the time signature changes more frequent and complex, and the riffs noticeably more intricate.  In fact, \\"Lonely Day\\" (not one of my favorites) contains a solo from Daron, which should put to rest the critique that he has limited ability while simultaneously highlighting the fact that he obviously does not believe in shameless self-glorification over song quality.<br /><br />And speaking of Daron, the primary songwriter for the band is featured more prominently on the vocals here, and though this has already tragically and predictably led to tabloid-maniacal fervor over the possible dissent in the ranks (see aforementioned The Washington Post 11/20/05 article), Malakian's added vocal role takes nothing away from Serj's ability to command attention.  Instead, the two attain a level of harmonization not present on any previous releases, and the result is SOAD's most impressive vocal performance yet.<br /><br />This obvious cognizance and intent is what leads me to praise this release as a more fitting heir to the genius of Toxicity.  I mean, I do enjoy Mezmerize, but that effort demonstrated standard SOAD originality, but no growth.  With Hypnotize, you have the eerily composed and epic nature of \\"Holy Mountains\\", the vocal oddities of \\"U-Fig\\", the never attained before heaviness of \\"Attack\\" and \\"Dreaming\\", and the ever-present intensity that was such a strength for Toxicity all coming together as evidence that this band has accurately identified its strong points, and is now ready to expand and exploit them.<br /><br />Whether it's the to be expected quirkiness of tracks like \\"Vicinity of Obscenity\\", or the cohesion of the title track, System of a Down has reaffirmed the widespread accolades it received for its monumental Toxicity.  Retaining every bit of unrestrained fury and unmatched personality of that landmark release, Hypnotize also does what Mezmerize could not; provides evidence that this is a band we have yet to hear the best of.This obvious cognizance and intent is what leads me to praise this release as a more fitting heir to the genius of Toxicity.

B0006SSOHC|3.0|...but there was a healthy dose of suspense and enough twists to keep the viewer interested. <br /> <br />What loses me is the title and cover, which I thought conveyed a more demented body chopping scenario. I expected to see some serial killer sawing up his victims, but that's not what this film is about. The saw doesn't come into play until the end, after being introduced in the beginning, at which time we assume what it's final use will be anyway. Another title and presentation should have been used to correctly convey the films personality. <br /> <br />The saw is not the main focus, and certainly not the main tool of carnage in this clever film. Yes, I said clever. I cannot knock the originality, and freshness of this plot, but I think the title and cover do not do it justice. This is a great story with some good and bad acting, but overall a good thrill. It is deceiving. I'm actually surprised they made part two. <br /> <br />People may come away unhappy because they expected one thing based on the name and packaging, yet got something completely different.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|\\"You'll be loved you'll be loved<br />Like you never have known<br />The memories of me<br />Will seem more like bad dreams<br />Just a series of blurs<br />Like I never occurred<br />Someday you will be loved\\"<br /><br />Funeral-style musical beginnings soon change into romantic notions about Manhattan as Benjamin Gibbard explores his inner world in metaphors and poetic explorations into sorrow. I like the way the first song awakens and then suddenly just stops without completion. It provides a ledge for Soul Meets Body to jump from as it freefalls into a mingling of soul-uplifting melodies that seem to then take off on their own journeys of mysterious lyrics that paint an image of a mind that views the world like an artist views a scene while painting. You can see each story as it progresses to the point that you feel nostalgic as if you have been to the places being described.<br /><br />\\"Different Names for the Same Thing\\" changes moods midstream and goes from the sounds of a piano being played in an empty room with wood floors to feeling as if you are sitting in the middle of a stage right next to the drum. It is unique in its echoes and structure to the point of almost muffling out the lyrics in favor of the instruments, which might be what sitting in the middle of a stage feels like during a concert. They seem to enjoy leaving a signature sound at the end of some songs and this one is no exception.<br /><br />\\"I Will Follow You Into The Dark\\" is very Romeo and Juliet. \\"Your Heart Is An Empty Room\\" is calming and upbeat all at once as Benjamin Gibbard's lyrics remain consistent in his unique style that almost seems to smooth out the ride of a musical train in motion pressing forward to an ever disappearing location.<br /><br />Most of the songs seem to be telling a story of the desire for consistency in an inconsistent world with the addition of fate and the wearing down of reality as you wished it could remain without the erosion of emotions. Benjamin Gibbard's lyrics capture moments and propel you into truthful experiences you might remember from your own past or wonder about in the future.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewexperiences you might remember from your own past or wonder about in the future.     ~The Rebecca Review
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Not for the children! Prepare yourself for a few foul remarks, but also prepare yourself for some great laughs. It took a little bit for this movie to get going, but once it did I was hooked! After the first twenty minutes of character building - during which time we learn of Shaun's girl trouble, lousy job, are introduced to Ed, Shaun's flatulent, crude roommate and assorted other necesary story details - I was pleasantly surprised by the originality of this film in light of it being a \\"zomie flick.\\"  <br /> <br />The zombie action begins with Shaun totally unaware as he goes about his morning routine. After short walk to the market he casually selects his beverage from a case covered with bloody handprints, slips on blood (I assume) as he heads toward the counter, tells the living-dead storeowner that he owes him 5 pence and returns home, passing gory and comical undead scenes along the way. With absolutely no clue of what's going on. Until he and his roommate Ed find the \\"drunk\\" girl in their garden.  <br /> <br />Cricket bat and shovel in hand, Shaun and Ed venture into a city overrun with walking dead, on their way to save the day. It is certainly not just another living dead movie. Shaun of the Dead is an original treat, loaded with character, huge doses of fun, charm and wit. Oh, and it also serves up a healthy dose of gore and blood. This film is a must for fans of a true horror comedy.
0553801503|5.0|I really enjoyed A Feast for Crows. I thought it added significantly to the world George RR Martin created in the first three books in the series in both depth and story movement. It was faced paced, action packed and I could hardly bear to put it down. The wrinting was classic Martin: he captures an enormous amount of details with very few words. Strangely, many reviewers here have basically stated that this book stinks. So I have written this review in an attempt to counter those arguments.<br /><br />Other reviewers have charged that no significant plot development has occurred in Feast. Huh? Did you read the book? Highly significant and important things happened in The Iron Isles, King's Landing, Dorne, The Eyrie, Oldtown and even Braavos. All of which deal with the further deepening of the chaos in Westeros, new/possible alliances or the inevitable invasion of Daenerys (I loath to give details because I don't want this to be a spoiler review). Yes Brieanne's story has few of these, but few have mentioned that it's actually the Arya sections with the fewest of all. Even Samwell's sections have significant happenings.<br /><br />Other reviewers have stated that this book is less action packed than the last three. This is true, but only in comparison. It is still fast paced and image rich. And there are still plenty of battles (if that's what counts as action). I see this book as the calm after the storm that was the war of the five kings, and the calm before what promises to be the much larger storm of the clash between ice and fire. This book is about the pivotal moments where the last few actions can be performed before the new storm hits.<br /><br />Other reviewers have stated that the book could have used some editing, citing that nothing of significance happened (not at all true, see above), that some characters were unneccessary to the story, or that there was a lot of fluff. First, ALL the characters were in fact quite neccessary to all the significant plot twists. The possible exceptions being Brieanne and Arya, but there was good reason to put both of these characters into this book that didn't have to do with plot (plot is not everything). For Arya it's easy, she's a main character who, we assume, will play a role of major significance in the end of the series. Thus, we need to know her history. For Brieanne we don't know what her significance will be, but her story is, I feel, a major positive addition to the book. Why? Her adventures allow us to see parts of Westeros in its full brutal beauty. Through Brieanne we see the plight of the common folk, and get a feel for the real hardship that the war of the five kings has caused. We get snapped out of that oh so cozy and romantic world of castles and knights, we see the horrors of war. This is something that almost no other fantasy series EVER attempts and I think that Martin should be commended for it. Further, Brieanne is perhaps the most human of characters. Stories are about characters, about their ordeals and how they are effected by those challenges. Characters are what make the world real for us, if we don't see the world through their eyes then the book is just movement from one plot point to the next with no substance. A book filled with only plot pivots is BORING.<br /><br />So what then should be edited out? Nothing. Martin writing is still excellent, and he wastes no words in every story that he's telling. All the details add to something that furthers the story so there is no chaff here.<br /><br />Some have said that Martin's world is balooning out of control much like Jordan's did. I don't see that at all. One well deserved gripe about Jordan is that he keeps expanding the story and never finishes anything. This is not so for Martin. First, Martin HAS in fact moved the story closer to completion. The major accomplishment of this book is in moving the inevitable invasion by Daenerys from something that is far away to something much more immediate (andDaenerys wasn't even IN the book). I expect much of the work this book did in preparing Westeros will be echoed on the other side of the sea in Dance. Through Brieanne especially (yes Brieanne), the story arcs of many minor characters come to an end. Yes, a few new arcs have arisen, but we have known that those were going to be neccessary for a long time (specifically Dorne and the Iron Islands). So these additions are not unexpected nor distracting. Given that Feast is really only half a book (Dance with Dragons is the forthcoming companion), there is some cause to believe that some balooning is occuring and it is possible that the series will be seven or more books. But the question to ask is: is the balooning neccessary? Given that most of the extra bulk of Feast comes from the addition of Dorne and the Iron Isles I would say yes in fact it is. Some would say that Brieanne's story is unneccessary, but I have already defended that choice. In all large tales the story must expand before it can contract, and in my view all signs point toward this book and the next (because it's really the other half of this book) being the end of the expansion. Martin has shown no qualms about ending story arcs (and this book is no exception). So, I believe that we will have a 2-3 (probably 3) book deminuedo after Dance, making the series 7-8 books long (the series was originally slated to be 6 books long). Another major problem that people have with Jordan (again well deserved) is that he uses too much extra verbage (for example, describing the clothing of everyone in the room every time). But this extra verbage has NEVER been a problem of Martin's, and this is still true in Feast.<br /><br />There IS one major flaw in this book. And that is: it is only half a book! Martin hides this fact fairly well by writing the full story for half the characters. But, alas, I still felt the lack. I realize that this decision was made for publishing reasons, but part of what made the other three books so great was the immense scope of the story. Because this book has tightened its focus we lose that feeling of immensity. I think this will be rectified when A Dance with Dragons comes out, but I sincerely hope that no more books will be produced in this way. I also believe that all the criticisms in the reviews boil down to this point: people felt a bit cheated by that lack of immensity and, feeling frustrated from the five year wait for this new book, tore into the author with their anger. When all is said and done, and the series is finally complete, I think people will have a very different take on what a Feast for Crows means to the series.mediate (and Daenerys wasn't even IN the book).

B00005JN2Z|4.0|Excellent! While the true origin of Cruise's character remains somewhat a mystery, it's balanced by the fact that we don't need much to convince us of his personality, or his goals. Meanwhile we learn plenty about Foxx's character and we sympathize with his plight, becoming truly concerned for his well being, and witness to what his character eventually becomes capable of.  <br /> <br />Plenty of suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat and Collateral delivers hearty punches in the action department as well, with great shootouts and hand to hand dirty work. Or should I say hand to neck.  <br /> <br />Well written, well acted and well directed. Collateral gets my vote for one of the top action movies of 2004.
B000024D4R|5.0|I think \\"floydians\\" will agree with me that if they had to pinpoint one Floyd album as being pure genius, ANIMALS would be on top of the list. DSOTM and WYWH are examples of flawless music, great production, brilliant songwriting and near-perfect lyrics but I think Animals just about beats the other two in the \\"genius\\" category.DSOTM and WYWH were groundbreaking albums and I absolutely love those albums (Hey, I love anything by PF ! ), but there is something about Animals for which I keep going back to it again and again.<br /><br />I think the reason for it is David Gilmour. Yes, I know Roger Waters wrote the lyrics and the concept was entirely his (BTW the concept of Animals did not come about until the end of the studio recordings), but it is Dave who steals the show with his angry guitar playing, consistent with the mood of the problem.The band (sans waters) was obviously not pleased with Waters increasing hegemony over the band, especially when it came to songwriting.  Nick Mason has said during an interview that by this time Roger thought that he could be PINK FLOYD and do everything by himself (The final Cut !!). I think Dave stood up to the \\"injustice ?\\" with the only way he knows best, by belting rocking solos in \\"Dogs\\" and \\"Sheep\\". That was Daves way of saying that PF were not a finished group regardless of the power struggle in the band. Anything from Rick Wright was vetoed and Dave himself got just one credit for his stellar show. But I think this is one of the reasons why Animals rocks as you can feel the animosity in their music. Was \\"Sheep\\" indirectly aimed at the other members of the group ? The \\"Sheeps\\" obvioulsy being the rest of the group while the Roger is both a \\"Pig\\" as well as the \\"Dog\\". Whatever the reason, the resulting chemistry or rather the lack of it gives Animals that much more of a personal touch to it. One has to commend PF for atleast putting aside their differences  and coming up with this absolute rocker of a album.
B000683VI4|4.0|I read some reviews that paint The Notebook in a bad light, but I liked it. It was a touching film, well written, well acted and directed, and in my opinion the actors were perfectly cast for their parts.  <br /> <br />The Notebook tells the tale of a summer love that stands the test of time. In a retirement home nestled along a picturesque southern river bank, an old gentleman, \\"Duke\\" (Garner), reads regularly to a charming elderly woman (Rowlands), who suffers memory loss and confusion due to dimentia. He reads to her from a book that tells the story of a young couple (Gosling, McAdams) who were drawn together during a summer of love in a small southern town. This love proves to hold strong even through separation and the impending marriage of the young lady to another man.  <br /> <br />My wife and I actually cried at the end. Call me shallow, but The Notebook puts things into perspective for those in a relationship. It reminds us how important love is, how special life is, and how we need to make the most of things and focus on life and really living it
B000ASATWQ|5.0|I love Damian Marley and his music. I have a three disc cd player with Welcome to Jamrock, Mr. Marley, and Halfway Tree in it. All day and all night thats the music I am listening to. I cannot get enough of Damian. You hear Bob Marley in him but in a more Dancehall way. I know that brother Bob looking down from heaven feeling rather proud of his kids right now. They all do a wonderful job on their cd's but I am a Damian-a-holic. If you are thinking about buying this cd do just that you will not regret it and while you at it if you havent gotten Halfway Tree and Mr. Marley now is the time to do so.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|This album is just another marketing scheme to get as much profit from the Emancipation of Mimi. I was never a Mariah fan, but thought that her comeback was well worth the buy. I listened to the album and liked maybe two or three tracks, but I found myself listening to tired R&B grooves over a tired voice. Mariah can hit high notes, thats great. The album was marketed as the \\"return of the voice\\", and thats exactly all it is -- a voice. This album has no emotions or lyrical credit, and will quickly be forgotten like all of Mariah's other \\"hits\\". This platinum edition is a pathetic attempt to hold on to her number one status, having topped Madonna by just one hit. The new single \\"dont forget about us\\" sounds exactly like all of Mariah's other songs. The song is just getting air play because her touched up body is naked in a bath. Let's face it, Mariah is just a voice with no personality - which is why she is so marketable. This girl was a joke a year ago, but she quickly forgot it and went back to becoming a diva. Mariah needs to be taken down a peg or two. This album is boring, and this comeback has reached it's expiration date.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|After looking at the other reviews, telling you once again that the Film is fantastic is waste of time! <br /> <br />But wad does OLDBOY have to offer that other films in the genre haven't already done? <br /> <br />Well, this is a revenge drama/ thriller, laced with violence and an ending that would make the morality bone is your body twitch... <br /> <br />If you are searching for a movie that would awaken your senses, and if you are looking for your plasma to be a canvas of moving poetry. If you want to have a talking point after watching a film, OLDBOY is X, and X marks the spot!  <br /> <br />But beware, this is not a gore type of violent film, but rather suggestive violence. But it's question on morality, might leave you feeling sick, but trust me, you will see yourself coming back.... <br /> <br />TALKING POINT, VISUAL ESTASCY, EXCELLENT PLOT, FANTASTIC DVD- PICTURE AND SOUND. it's a no brainer!!!
B0000028M7|5.0|I've been a fan of Alice In Chains for about 5 years now. I'm only sorry I discovered them so late (well, I only got into Grunge, Metal and Alternative when I turned 13). I got this album after hearing their \\"Greatest Hits\\" and seeing \\"Them Bones\\" on T.V. And all I can say about this album is - brutal, sorrowful, incredible, satisfying genius! I'm going to review each song for you so you can get a complete view of the album as it is - and if you'd rather not read the review, at least read the end: I'll give you guys a few Alice In Chains Rareties Titles that you can download if you don't have them. As far as I know they're not on any recorded albums - so I'll be happy to share the tracks with you. Anyway, here's the low down on Alice In Chains' \\"Dirt.\\"<br /><br />\\"Them Bones\\" kicks the album off and is an extremely angry, bitter song that reeks of self-loathing and confusion. The song basically comments on how we will all die one day and how it is an inescapable inevitability. It also plays on the folk-song titled \\"Them Bones.\\" It's a great, succinct, direct and hard-hitting song. It's not my absolute favourite, but it's definitely way up there with my best. It gets 10/10, no doubt.<br /><br />\\"Dam That River\\" is another heavy and rather short song. But in my opinion it's even better than \\"Them Bones.\\" It's just got some killer guitar work and nicely interspersed lead bits. It's slightly more complex than \\"Them Bones\\" and also uses metaphors of a River flooding to explain an incident that occured between Jerry Cantrell and Shaun Kinney. According to Mike Starr's Biography \\"Unchained\\" (which I'm currently reading - it's pretty funny and is actually a biography of the whole band in essence) Jerry was pi$$ing off Sean and so Sean proceeded to break a coffee table over the arrogant guitarist's head. This caused Jerry to move out of the band's communal house and in with Eddie Vedder. He focused his anger for Sean into this very song. The reason this song is so great is because it has a really interesting if somewhat strange backstory, and is just well structured and written. \\"Dam That River\\" gets 11/10 in my book!<br /><br />\\"Rain When I Die\\" is a rather macabre song that starts off with an almost sluggish bassline and Cantrell's signature Wah-Wah stylings. The vocals then kick in with a kind of climactic wailing and then moves into a Wah-Wah driven riff. The song is rather slow and seems to be talking about the end of a long relationship (hey, these songs are everywhere!). I must admit that it isn't my best, but I consider it to be a great song. Track 3 gets 9/10 I think.<br /><br />\\"Down In A Hole\\" is a really sad and sorrowful song. The verse riff is driven by a Chorus/Phaser effect and Layne's vocals are soulful and penetrating. The song seems to be talking about being alone and depressed. Perhaps it even speaks about how those bred for success often \\"fail\\" in a sense. This song grew on me after a few listens and is pretty saddening. The lyrics are intelligent and meaningful and it's a really wonderful song. \\"Down In A Hole\\" gets 9.5/10.<br /><br />\\"Sickman\\" starts off with drums and then the guitar starts up soon thereafter. This song talks about confusion and about being sick, delerious and depressed. The song is pretty strange and is oddly structured. It certainly makes you feel pretty weird and almost like you're in your own world I guess. I like this song but I consider it to be just good. I give \\"Sickman\\" 8/10. It's just not that memorable, but it's a good listen nonetheless.<br /><br />\\"Rooster\\" is a classic A.I.C song. The song is about Jerry Cantrell's father who served in the Vietnam War. He was known as \\"The Rooster\\" and so this is a very personal song for Jerry. It's sad, haunting, deep and simply classic. If you're by yourself at night and lying on the bed, you may just cry when you hear this song. It's just that incredible, and for many A.I.C fans, they already know that. 10.5/10 for \\"Rooster.\\"<br /><br />\\"Junkhead\\" is a pretty heavy song with a great chorus. It talks about Drug use and how the band members would often do anything to get pills, needles and weed. The song is pretty angry and has an element of regret in it - clearly the band members all feel ashamed of their actions, but at the same time they also seem to explain why they did the things they did. You'll almost always sing along to \\"What's my drug of choice?...Well what have you got?\\" It's a damn good track and earns 9.5/10 from my side. Also be sure to listen to the solo, it's really cool!<br /><br />\\"Dirt\\" starts off with a lead bit supported by Kinney on cymbals. The song is medium paced and talks about the after effects of taking drugs and being alone, angry and regretful. As you can see, this album has a sense of time (an example of this is the previous songs \\"Sickman\\" and \\"Junkhead) as we see the illness, the feelings and desire for drugs, and then the after effects of drug use. The song has a great solo and is also filled with self-loathing and sadness. The riff is just fantastic, and the lyrics really reflect the feelings of Staley and the band with great effect. This song gets 10/10 in my opinion.<br /><br />\\"God Smack\\" has a great riff and some really freaky vocal work. Another idiot reviewer said that A.I.C were ripping off \\"Godsmack.\\" What this empty-headed fool doesn't realise is that \\"Godsmack\\" came years after A.I.C and took their name from this song! If I could, I would find that person and kick the $#!t out of him. Or her. Anyway, this song is angry and once again continues with the drug use theme and how things got progressively worse in the band. Layne sounds great on this track and really delivers and extremely unique vocal performance and all the other band members carry off their parts excellently. \\"God Smack\\" gets 9/10.<br /><br />\\"Intro (Dream Sequence),\\" also known as \\"Iron Gland\\" is just an interlude and is just pretty freaky. Not a song really, so there's no need to rate this little piece.<br /><br />\\"Hate To Feel\\" begins with Cantrell's guitar and then Kinney and Staley coming in soon thereafter. The song is pretty slow and talks about the recovery from drug use and how it is a slow and painful process. The song is angry and apocalyptic and speaks volumes of how ex-drug users withdraw into themselves and feel awful from withdrawal symptons. The song's great but is by no means a classic. It scores 8.5/10 over here.<br /><br />\\"Angry Chair\\" is a really umm...angry and tense song. This track seems to be talking about what it's like to be grounded as a child or taking time out, but seems to look at the psychological effects on a kid. There again it could be talking about what it's like to be alone and confused and not really understanding why. The drums are awesome in this song, as is the guitar riff. Layne penetrates deeply and really dishes out an emotional whirlwind for the listener. It's just a fantastic song and the video always creeps me out! 10.5/10 for \\"Angry Chair.\\"<br /><br />And now, the closer, \\"Would?\\" Man do I love this song. It's probably my favourite song by the band. Every time I listen to the opening bassline I can just feel the shivers down my spine. The song is ghostly and is unintrusive in some respects. The lyrics are phenomenal and always remind me of a fallout I had with some of my friends 2 and a half years ago. The lyrics talk about making a mistake and how your friends won't forgive you. I almost cry when it gets to the end of the song, it's simply haunting. And when Layne says \\"left you here alone!\\" I just feel so incredibly regretful. It's a song that helped me through many days of loneliness and confusion, and I know that it'll be meaningful to you too. \\"Would?\\" gets an undeniable 11/10! Don't even argue with me on that one!<br /><br />Overall, I'd give this CD 93%. It's just an amazing experience and I've got to give all the band members huge credit. Every one made it personal, unique and just totally incredible. If you love A.I.C, you had better own this CD! It's simply brilliant! Just buy it today, you won't regret it at all!<br /><br />Now for those songs I promised. Search for the following song titles by Alice In Chains:<br /><br />1) \\"Blue\\" - this is an acoustic song by the band but is really beautiful. I totally love this song! Find it quickly!<br /><br />2) \\"Foolish\\" - Another beautiful song but is way more electric. Find it, it's fantastic! And the chorus - WOAH! Amazing!<br /><br />3) \\"Another Brick In The Wall\\" - A Pink Floyd Cover that's pretty funky and really slick. Check it out!<br /><br />4) \\"Heroin\\" - A faster version of \\"Real Thing\\" from the album \\"Facelift.\\" I prefer this version because it's just got more of a bite! Really fantastic!<br /><br />5) \\"Alone\\" - A song with Pearl Jam. It's an acoustic song but is worthy of great acclaim! It's a really great rare song, trust me!<br /><br />And those are the rareties that I've found so far. I'm not aware of their existence on other CD's or whatever, but if they do, I want those CDs! Anyway, I hope this has all been useful. Keep listening to Alice In Chains and may Layne Staley Rest In Peace always...to rate this little piece. <br /> <br />\\"Hate To Feel\\" begins with Cantrell's guitar and then Kinney and Staley coming in soon thereafter. The song is pretty slow and talks about the recovery from drug use and how it is a slow and painful process. The song is angry and apocalyptic and speaks volumes of how ex-drug users withdraw into themselves and feel awful from withdrawal symptons. The song's great but is by no means a classic. It scores 8.5/10 over here. <br /> <br />\\"Angry Chair\\" is a really umm...angry and tense song. This track seems to be talking about what it's like to be grounded as a child or taking time out, but seems to look at the psychological effects on a kid. There again it could be talking about what it's like to be alone and confused and not really understanding why. The drums are awesome in this song, as is the guitar riff. Layne penetrates deeply and really dishes out an emotional whirlwind for the listener. It's just a fantastic song and the video always creeps me out! 10.5/10 for \\"Angry Chair.\\" <br /> <br />And now, the closer, \\"Would?\\" Man do I love this song. It's probably my favourite song by the band. Every time I listen to the opening bassline I can just feel the shivers down my spine. The song is ghostly and is unintrusive in some respects. The lyrics are phenomenal and always remind me of a fallout I had with some of my friends 2 and a half years ago. The lyrics talk about making a mistake and how your friends won't forgive you. I almost cry when it gets to the end of the song, it's simply haunting. And when Layne says \\"left you here alone!\\" I just feel so incredibly regretful. It's a song that helped me through many days of loneliness and confusion, and I know that it'll be meaningful to you too. \\"Would?\\" gets an undeniable 11/10! Don't even argue with me on that one! <br /> <br />Overall, I'd give this CD 93%. It's just an amazing experience and I've got to give all the band members huge credit. Every one made it personal, unique andjust totally incredible. If you love A.I.C, you had better own this CD! It's simply brilliant! Just buy it today, you won't regret it at all! <br /> <br />Now for those songs I promised. Search for the following song titles by Alice In Chains: <br /> <br />1) \\"Blue\\" - this is an acoustic song by the band but is really beautiful. I totally love this song! Find it quickly! <br /> <br />2) \\"Foolish\\" - Another beautiful song but is way more electric. Find it, it's fantastic! And the chorus - WOAH! Amazing! <br /> <br />3) \\"Another Brick In The Wall\\" - A Pink Floyd Cover that's pretty funky and really slick. Check it out! <br /> <br />4) \\"Heroin\\" - A faster version of \\"Real Thing\\" from the album \\"Facelift.\\" I prefer this version because it's just got more of a bite!

It's a really great rare song, trust me! <br /> <br />And those are the rareties that I've found so far. I'm not aware of their existence on other CD's or whatever, but if they do, I want those CDs! Anyway, I hope this has all been useful. Keep listening to Alice In Chains and may Layne Staley Rest In Peace always...
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Let's be honest. 2005 was a rather bland year in music. Sure,we had bands like Franz Ferdinand, The Killers, Coldplay, and Foo Fighters churning out hits left and right. Aside from the up and coming machine beats of M.I.A., the so-so Black Eyed Peas and Gwen Stefani's smorgasboard of glossy styles, we really didn't have much else in the way of funky.Well I guess we had to wait until November. Now who would have thought that our Madonna, who had been getting more attention for her political views and religion (which some say is just another gold tooth or nose ring)than her actual music, would release one of the year's most notable records? When we last heard her in our players, it was on 2003's American Life, which felt a bit undercooked. Where on that record, she seemed to have traded her signature genre-crossing sound with the \\"electro-folk\\" that powered her Ray Of Light and Music albums. But in the case of American Life, that secret recipe had already expired. What's a girl to do? Why, hit the dance floor of course. And this being Madge, it comes so naturally. Anyone who was worried prior to the release about a full on dance record need not worry. On 'Confessions', Madonna parties like it's 1985. Or 1975. Or whatever. It's that attitude that gives the record it's spark. Madonna promises it will be okay, just shake your booty and the rest will follow. It's almost eerie to stand back and listen to Madonna doing all this, not that we doubted she could. But ITS JUST THAT GOOD. The songs all blend nicely together like a non stop DJ mix, and it's a good bet that this is the best party you'll attend in your living room all year. Kicking off with the ABBA-coated first single \\"Hung Up\\", it's infectious pop at its finest through the exquisite \\"Get Together\\" and the supposed second single \\"Sorry\\", which centers around a fed up Madonna saying \\"I've heard it all before\\". That's what makes 'Confessions' so brilliant in it's simplicity. Even at it's most chilled out, Madonna seems warm and vibrant again for the first time since 1998's Ray Of Light. And while there is not much in the way of \\"confessions\\" here and the emotional meat of Ray of Light and some of Music is absent, some of the album's declarations about independence (\\"Jump\\", \\"Sorry\\")and survival (\\"Let it Will Be\\", \\"Like it or Not\\") hold their own, as such themes did on albums such as Erotica and Bedtime Stories. But where those 90's albums (except for Ray of Light) often lacked sonically, 'Confessions' straightens Madonna's crown as the queen of dance music. The album never claimed to be end all for songwriting; I say this because I know critics will pan some of the lyrics. The best example is the dippy \\"I Love New York\\", which rhymes 'York' with dork, chooses to say \\"F-off\\" rather than just come out and say it, and then rhymes that with 'golf'. Yikes. Shouldn't New York deserve better than that? Still despite these and other minor flaws, we could be faced with another rap about soy lattes. The focal point here is dance, dance, dance. With a variety of samples, her own wizardry with producer Stuart Price, and the nostalgia for the nightlife Madonna has successfully reclaimed her throne. Standouts: Get Together, Sorry, Let it Will Be, Jump, and Isaac.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|I have to say that I have been a fan of System since their first release and with every album they just keep getting better and better!  Hypnotize is incredible and every track is exhilerating and emotional...something that System does so well.  System of a Down have never been afraid to push the envelope and with this double album Mesmerize/Hypnotize, they have proved once again that they are one of the most talented and brilliant bands of our time.  Hypnotize will not disappoint, I recommend it to every SOAD fan and anyone who appreciates great music!
B00005NNMK|4.0|Even though my favorite songs by Europe are on their first two albums, I think The Final Countdown is their most solid. The band's sound became more commercial with more keyboards and predictable drumming , but they still had guitar great John Norum in the band! The three singles/videos were for the title track, Carrie (ballad), and Rock The Night (good solo). But I also like Cherokee (good riff & great solo!), Ninja (good pre-chorus), Time Has Come (good verse), Heart Of Stone (another good verse & solo), and Love Chaser (more great guitar from Norum). Unfortunately (or fortunately?) Norum soon left the band and started a fairly successful solo career, later rejoining the band for last year's heavy Start From The Dark. I highly recommend their first album as well which was released in 1983!
0553801503|1.0|A disappointment as vast as the world GRRM is writing in.  Like so very many others, I loved the first three.  I waited with baited breath for this one.  I followed the website updates.  I ripped open the amazon package that contained my pre-ordered copy. <br /> <br />And waited for something to happen.  Anything. <br /> <br />Because I dutifully followed the updates, I knew not to expect to see many characters.  And I was still disappointed.  There's no plot advancement.  Fine.  I could handle that.  But there's no deepening of character as there once once with Jaime, no changes of heart or mind, no GROWTH. <br /> <br />After the meat of the first three, this is unsalted broth.  And just about as satisfying.
B000BKDOCA|5.0|I love remix CD's.  It adds a different and exciting touch to song we know and love.  It's great at party's to hear your favorite hits remixed, especially by my favorite recording artist Britney Spears!  I'm currently at work enjoying this compilation of my favorite Britney hits remixed and the new track too \\"And Then We Kiss.\\"  This CD will get a lot of play.  My friends who really aren't Britney fans better get used to it!!!  For the true Britney fans this will keep us satisfied for a short while.  Although we had \\"Greatest Hits: My Prerogative\\" in November '04 and now \\"B in the Mix\\" in November '05 the fans are very much ready for a new studio release with new material from Britney Spears!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Bravo to BBC.   I never dreamed that I could love a period piece more than Pride and Prejudice (Colin Firth version) but I was wrong.  This has to be the best mini-series I have ever seen.  All of the performances were top-notch, but Richard Armitage--oh my goodness--he embodied the character of John Thornton.  Where has the incredible actor been hiding?
B000B8QEZG|4.0|While not a milestone collection such as \\"Like a Prayer\\" or \\"Ray of Light\\", this fun-filled CD brings dance back to the mainstream. After 23 years, Madonna proves that she still has her finger on the pulse of music despite her ever-changing style. <br /> <br />Each & every track makes the listener want to bump, grind or flow to the beat of their disco-esque production. It took several listens of this collection for me to fully appreciate its musical value. <br /> <br />I hold Madonna as a lyricist in high esteem. Unfortunately, a handful of these songs lack quality lyrics (\\"I Love New York\\" is painful to listen to). Because of this, I can't give \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" 5 stars. However, the music on this CD speaks for itself.
B000B5UL7G|4.0|No longer collaborating with the esteemed & very able Guy Chambers, Robbie's new collaborator, Stephen Duffy either fails to engage, or he just isn't really trying. Right up front, it should be made clear, that I really want Robbie to make it at least half as well in America as he has in the UK. Not so sure that this is the album that will do it, but hope floats, doesn't it?  <br /> <br />While Life Thru a Lens was as powerful as a racehorse sprinting to the virtual finish, leaving I've Been Expecting You a satisfying, if only slightly pedestrian sophomore effort. All bets were paid off with the stellar, perfect Sing When You're Winning, leaving Escapology a very close second. Swing When You're Winning & Live at Knebworth remain his pinnacle releases, but seeing as the former was [almost entirely] an excellent \\"covers with friends\\" effort & the latter, while a riveting live effort, not since Frampton has a live album really taken the prize, especially if never official released stateside. In order to crack the U.S. market, he needs to really show in the studio.  <br /> <br />Intensive Care is at first so seemingly mellow, almost too \\"pop/bubblegum\\" radio-friendly, as to be off-putting. \\"Ghosts\\" is an excellent opener, partnered effectively with the faux-reggae \\"Tripping\\" for a respectable one-two punch. The next two, \\"Make Me Pure\\" & \\"Spread Your Wings\\" immediately squander all that the opening pair promised. \\"Advertising Space\\" brings things back into near-focus, but the name-dropping [Brando, Watergate, Vietnam] leave a lot to be desired. \\"Please Don't Die\\" nearly feels like another \\"Angels,\\" but not quite. At this point, there is clearly need for another punch. \\"Your Gay Friend\\" delivers, blasting along with full-on rock intensity; back, too, is the marvelous Robbie sense of humor, wordplay and those oh-so-titillating possibilities that he might just swing. Sameness prevails on the boorish Sin Sin Sin & The Trouble With Me, which both sound phoned in. Random Actsof Kindness takes on an almost Sgt Pepper/Magical Mystery Tour feel; especially love the gut-bucket harmonica. With its prevailing peace on earth, good will lyric & feel, this could easily replace what \\"Angels\\" has been for some. \\"A Place to Crash\\" invites back the kick-butt rocker. Leaving \\"King of Bloke & Bird\\" to close on an elegant, if somewhat awkward tone, especially the final, haunting, ethereal chord at the closing, which seems almost to tease that maybe, just maybe, there might be something more. \\"Summer me on to another day...\\" indeed.  <br /> <br />Still, Robbie far transcends any male pop star that the U.S. has tried to market to the masses. Even if we would have liked a little more earnestness & originality, in the long run, Robbie is worth having even if the transition with Duffy is, at least at this point, a tad wanting.  <br />
B000BM6AVA|4.0|I am a big system of a down fan and i like all of their songs. this cd it a pretty good cd but its not one of their best.but its still good i recomend buying it.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I saw this movie, unfortunitly with english sub. 'cause it was in Japanese, but it rules! To be honest, the battles are a little bit over the top, you can't blink at all during a battle, but it's freakin sweet!
B0001CCXY8|5.0|\\"The Wretched Spawn,\\" Cannibal Corpse's sixth album without original frontman Chris Barnes, is one of the better death metal albums of 2004, and probably CC's best release since Barnes left the group. George Fisher, the new vocalist, is very deep and gruff, but his vocals aren't monstrous. Plus, George does change speed (as in tracks one and two), but he doesn't change pitch; there are almost no shrieks or high pitched yells, on here. Other than that, though, this record has everything you need for great death metal: huge riffs, rapid fire drums, propulsive tempos, speaker vibrating rhythms, disgusting lyrics, etc. Even an occasional solo flares up from time to time. \\"Psychotic Precision\\" has surging, grinding riffs, jackhammer drums, and two solos. The title track slows down and becomes an almost bobbing beat, but then a scorching solo kicks in and speeds the pace back up. \\"Cyanide Assassin\\" begins with a fast, steam rolling beat, but it slows down and some super heavy, churning riffs take over. \\"Festering in the Crypt\\" is a mid-paced rocker which gains momentum with cascading riffs and a high pitched yell. \\"Nothing Left to Mutilate\\" features a pounding rhythm, with dizzying, circular riffs and fast double bass drumming. \\"Rotted Body Landslide\\" sounds like the drummer, Paul, is cracking his snare drum, and \\"Slain\\" has more fast, buzzsaw riffs. If you're new to Cannibal Corpse, or if you like growls more than monstrous vocals, \\"The Wretched Spawn\\" is a good place to start. And if you like death metal, nothing should prevent you from picking up this album.
B000000OU6|3.0|I could listen to Slash play all day long and I can't knock \\"five o'clock somewhere\\"  but.. <br />I got the \\"ain't life grand\\" CD first and it sounds like two different bands. <br />I'm sure a lot of people will like \\"five o'clock somewhere\\" but  <br />except for the guitar playing I didn't care much for \\"five o'clock somewhere\\". <br />If you don't have either of these CD's I'd recommend getting \\"ain't life grand\\" first.
0780622553|5.0|The preview for this movie always caught my attention but for some reason for many years I didn't have the chance to rent it since I never seen it at my local movie rental place nor did I see it on TV ever.  <br /> <br />But last year,  I purchased it from Amazon since the price was excellent and I wanted to quench the thirst I had for several years regarding this movie. I had the pleasure of seeing one of the director's previous films \\"The Crow\\" which is another great movie. <br /> <br />Now back to \\"Dark City\\" the movie has a very nice gloomy feel to the film and instantly it begins with mystery. The plot was well written and the film has a nice surprise towards the end. You get this feeling of being lost and afraid with John, the main character, who searches to find the truth about himself and finds himself caught in the middle of being accused of several murders he can't remember committing or did he do them??? and who are the men after him??? what is the riddle to your memories?? do they belong to you and indeed happened or just pretend?? and why does the city never see light but is only covered in a blanket of darkness???....these are the many questions you will find out when you watch the movie <br /> <br />If you like mystery and sci-fi type of movies, then I recommend this movie to you. And if you are a fan of the director of \\"The Crow\\", then check this masterpiece out!!
0385507755|2.0|I just can't figure out what the appeal is with this book. I've talked to and read reviews from so many people who \\"just couldn't put it down.\\" It literally fell out of my hands every night as I fell asleep reading it. I guess something about it reaches many - as indicated by the majority rave reviews. I was just expecting something more compelling. <br /> <br />
B0000028M7|4.0|As rock's cautionary tales about heroin abuse go, this one holds a little extra resonance.  It never sat all that comfortably with the grunge label, but rocked like early Sabbath wished it could.<br /><br />I never enjoyed the more popular songs all that much (i.e. \\"Rooster\\" and \\"Angry Chair\\"), but love the remaining tracks -- which veered further away from the rock norm.  The album flows despite it's crackling, strained psychological underpinnings and themes of anguish and disgust.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|I really think that this is their best album yet. I enjoy listing to System of a Down's ever evolving music.
B00006M183|3.0|Underrated. Made after much tragedy in the bands personal lives and the US (9/11). Disillusion and confusion murk much of the lyrics and, as on every Pearl Jam album, hope for better things to come (Love Boat Captain). To fully appreciate this album you have to be able to relate to they band as they were in this time of their lives. I might be biased, as personal and big picture disillusion both occurred to me in roughly the same era, but this is one of their most influential albums on my life. For those who haven't met this same phase, it might resonate more, as Vedder says, \\"When the big lie hits your eyes.\\"

I ONLY like 3 songs on hypnotize which is lonely day, hypnotize and soldier side. all the other song i could live without. mezmerize was an awesome album i listend to it for a month straight nothing else now im a bit tired of it but i still love it... hypnotize just falls so short of its predecessor

B00005JO1G|5.0|this movie is based on the memoirs of Anthony Swafford, a soldier in the first gulf war, so to say that it is unoriginal just doesn't make sense. it tells of the marines going insane while waiting for the war to start, and then going insane waiting to fight. when the war did start, the air support took out most of the republican guard, saddam's army. the fact that they did not die in remote places should not take away from their honor. and the soldiers who fought in vietnam did have problems when they came back. if you're ignorant enough that you need violence to enjoy a movie, maybe try something else. the acting is great, with many oscar winners. as for the language, if you dont like the f word, maybe dont see this movie. however, realize that it is war, and that you hear the same language everyday.  <br />this movie is very entertaining. the performances are awesomely powerful. highly recommended
B000B8QEYC|5.0|I think *Amid the Falling Snow* and *It's in the Rain* and *Long, Long Journey* and *Amarentine* are songs with secrets to share. <br /> <br />Just beautiful...
B000BJS4OY|5.0|What a sensational gift from Bruce.<br /><br />5 stars just ain't enough.<br /><br />Maybe 10 stars with a few planets thrown in...<br /><br />The remastered cd of Born to Run is one thing, the concert from Hammersmith Odeon in another.<br /><br />This could be the greatest concert I have ever seen.<br /><br />The talent and passion of Springsteen is other worldly.<br /><br />At times he seems lost in prayer, like during Thunder Road (the definitive version is on this dvd).<br /><br />Other times he is absolutely manic (Rosie, Quarter to Three).<br /><br />Every song is a highlight.<br /><br />Be prepared for a very emotional journey as 30 years flashes before your eyes.<br /><br />Nobody makes me feel as old or as young as Bruce.<br /><br />I have seen Bruce several times in every decade , this dvd captures the spirit and the passion like no other.<br /><br />For the Bruce fan, no further explanation is needed.<br /><br />For those who always wondered what all the hype was about, you'll get the idea with this show.<br /><br />A wonderful gift from Bruce.
0671027387|3.0|This novel has a good characters and a great plot, but the author goes too far and tries to be another Tom Clancy and spoils the book by not doing his homework.<br /><br />For whatever reason, Dan Brown tries to describe technology that he has ABSOLUTELY NO CLUE about.<br /><br />Case in point: a Los Angeles class submarine does not have two reactors, nor does it have a super secret sound isolated conference room. It wasn't even necessary to the plot to add that kind of detail. There are many other instances of the same techno-silliness that distract the reader.<br /><br />While many of the things he talks about are factual, he destroys his credibility with sheer nonsense that wasn't even necessary.<br /><br />The book is still worth reading, but he should do a bit more research on subjects he's weak in.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|An album by Madonna (one of the most conceited person on Earth) that is not political (except for hints in \\"I Love New York\\"). This album is not like her last several over the last 10 years. Madonna \\"was\\" talented in the 1980s. I think she hit an all time low with American Life (except Hollywood). I have grown with madonna (the name really doesn't fit her does it?) since her 1983 first album and through the 90s I was disappointed over and over again while Madonna became more and more into herself (Esther?). Not bad from a has been artist who thinks she knows it all.
B00005JLR2|5.0|I'd like to get this out of the way in the beginning: I have not read the book or seen any other adaptation of Treasure Island. That's fine for me because I can't compare it to an earlier impression and then be disapointed by that comparison. That being said, I shall get on with my review. <br /> <br />I was expecting absolutely nothing great when I first watched this movie, but then the movie took off in the direction of greatness. The visuals were second to none, the voice-acting was great, and the plot and characters all hit their marks properly.  <br /> <br />This movie bombards you with great designs. From the incredible designs of the captain, to the various space ships, you are constantly in awe at the creativity of the creators.  <br /> <br />The characters all carried an emotional weight to them (the exception of course being the incredibly irritating CGI character B.E.N.) and delivered their lines in the most optimal way possible. <br /> <br />If you appreciate good visual design, you absolutely have to see this movie.  <br /> <br />If you're just looking for something to watch, you could be doing a helluva lot worse than this.
B00005N5S5|5.0|the Terminator series is now full circle. originally, O.J. Simpson was supposed to be the Terminator, however, Arnold Schwarzeneggar grabbed that role. since Arnold is now governor, I know the perfect candidate for the Terminator in case no. 4 comes out: Jean-Claude Van Damme. the plot line for all three Terminator movies is simple: assassinate John Connor so that the human resistance will lose. as always, a protector is sent to keep him from harm. In this case, Kyle Reese is sent to protect Sarah from the T-101. Kyle becomes the father of John. the T-101 gets terminated in the end, right under a hydraulic press. please produce Terminator 4!
B000BGH22W|4.0|I was disappointed when John Williams was not going to write the score for this movie, since he is one of my favorite movie score composers. It's sad that Patrick Doyle only uses the original harry potter tune a couple times in the whole movie, but his score is also much different from the past 3 Harry Potter movies. I think it should also be noted that the UK version of this soundtrack includes 3 bonus songs, including the song sung during the Yule Ball scene by the Weird Sisters.
0316666343|5.0|I thuroughly enjoyed this book hands down my favortie. The imagery and storyline is so believeable it make you cry. The reader hangs on bated breath watching as susie does. I strongly recommend.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|With a vengeance! Great DM record, compares well with all of their others. But it's especially nice after the lacking \\"Exciter\\". I saw them live for the first time a couple of nights ago; maybe the best concert I've ever been to! <br />Still stong after all these years.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|In 1984, when I was 16 years-old, I didn't know any of Pink Floyd's music.  Then one day I rented PINK FLOYD THE WALL, having only heard that it was supposed to be a real cool movie.  Ninety minutes later, I was stunned, dumbfounded, and knocked senseless.  I couldn't believe what I'd just seen and I hadn't understood ANY of it.  Nightmare images combined with intense animation.  But, goddamn, what incredible rock music!  Like a persistent 90 minute rock video!  I rewound it to the beginning and watched it again.  Before the tape had to be returned, I'd watched it three or four times. <br /> <br />Thus began my love for the band Pink Floyd; with a movie.  I raced out to buy THE WALL album, which was almost immediately followed by THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON, WISH YOU WERE HERE, ANIMALS, THE FINAL CUT and MEDDLE.  My obssession was born and Pink Floyd has been my favorite band ever since. <br /> <br />Director Alan Parker will probably be remembered least for this one; not with movies like MIDNIGHT EXPRESS, FAME and EVITA under his belt.  Makes no nevermind.  Pink Floyd fans count for plenty in this world and PINK FLOYD THE WALL will remain a rock and roll movie classic!
B00092ZMDY|4.0|**** - FOUR STARS <br />=================== <br /> <br />Excellent musicianship as always. The Eagles are without question one of the greatest bands to see in a live setting, and this captures them playing most, if not all of their greatest hits from the past. The set list is quite impressive to say the least, and although these guys aren't in their prime anymore, they still kick ass live.... <br /> <br />I was very impressed. Although I enjoyed \\"Hell Freezes Over\\" more due to all of the original members playing, this is equally as enjoyable. Buy it with confidence, a great addition to your Eagles collection.... <br /> <br />
1563523302|3.0|I remember reading about this book when it came out.  I read that the book said that people who have a million or more dollars don't spend money like people who have a much lower net worth:  they drive good used cars for many years; they don't spend lots of money on status symbols; they live in simple homes... <br /> <br />That's really the whole gist of the book!  If you don't spend money, you'll be able to save more money.  Of course. <br /> <br />Also, if you don't spoil your kids, they'll learn to save more.  Also, you'd better keep the same spouse all your life.  Helps if you run your own business.  Keep your same house until you pay it off.  The wife is usually stay-at-home.  Well, you get the picture anyway. <br /> <br />This book was mildly interesting near the beginning, but then just became repetitious and, at times, insulting. <br /> <br />Get it from the library if you're interested, but don't buy it.  (You'll become a millionaire that much faster!)
B000B8QEYC|2.0|Now, before you other Enya fans go into defense mode, I want to say I really like her stuff and have been a fan of hers for many years.  <br /> <br />That being said... <br /> <br />This album is a bit of a letdown after such a long wait. (Okay, a lot of a letdown.) It's...well...boring. It lacks the intricate construction, memorable melodies and harmonies that earlier albums and tracks have. Take \\"To Go Beyond II\\": It has almost a fairytale, magical sound to it; \\"China Roses\\": It has beautiful harmonies and \\"softness\\" in it that delight the ears; \\"Long Boats\\" has a feeling of power and strength in it.  <br /> <br />Sadly, \\"Amarantine\\" has none of that.  <br /> <br />We all know Enya can do much better. Hopefully, in the not too distant future, she'll cut a new CD where her magic will return.
B000AM4PBS|5.0|WHERE IS THE 45 MINUTE SPECIAL THAT AIRED ON NBC CALLED \\"THE ONE WITH ALL THE OTHER ONES\\" (RIGHT BEFORE THE FINAL EPISODE). IT ORIGINALLY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE 2 HOURS LONG, BUT WAS CUT DOWN DUE TO TIME CONSTRAINTS FROM THE NETWORK. I RECENTLY BOUGHT THE TEN SEASON BOX SET AND WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND OUT THAT IT WASN'T INCLUDED.
B000BKDOCA|5.0|This compilation is an instant classic that boasts some of the strongest remixes heard in recent years, of some of Britney's most memorable tracks. The David Ospina mix of \\"...Baby One More Time\\" is probably one of the finest thumping beat-filled mix of a song that has been mixed countless times before. Next on the list of best songs on this mix-album is Dave Aud's mix of \\"Slave.\\" This mix accomplishes what seldom happens, the mix of the song is actually better than the original! Rauhofer's mix of \\"Toxic\\" is dark yet catchy, and the Valentin mix of \\"Everytime\\" turns this memorable ballad into an infectious dance-floor hit.  <br />Another masterpiece burried in this rich compilation of great dance music, is the Bill Hamel remix of \\"Touch of My Hand.\\" Perhaps the most underrated song on Britney's last album, this down-tempo song is turned into one of the most shiver-inciting dance tracks on this CD, with a grinding dance beat that compliments Britney's breathy vocals. <br />Remixes of two new songs are a welcome addition to this mix CD, with the Hi-Bias mix of \\"Someday\\" the finer of the two. Someday is one of Britney's strongest tracks to date, with a catchy hook, introspective lyrics and decent vocals. It's unfortunate that this song never made it as a radio hit. Junkie XL's mix of \\"And Then We Kiss\\" turns this new track in to a William Orbit-esque dance number, yet another showcase of Britney Spears' deserving status as dance pop royalty.   <br />
B00003CXAW|5.0|Let us all just forget, for a moment, all that we've come to know about mechanical sharks, blue screens and CGI, and go back in time to the year 1932, when KING KONG was being made. <br /> <br />Talking pictures were only five years-old.  KING KONG was about to introduce hardcore action combined with snappy dialogue and a spectacular musical soundtrack by Max Steiner.  In 1925, the silent film, THE LOST WORLD, had given audiences one of its first glimpses into the world of stop-and-go motion in the world of dinosaurs.  In April of 1933, the world was blown away by a giant ape and his all-out assault on humanity and the great city of New York.  Try to imagine audiences sitting in Radio City Music Hall in complete awe, asking themselves, \\"How on earth did they do that???\\" <br /> <br />Movie-making techniques shall continue to advance as long as the motion picture industry exists.  And lo, let us never forget it's most momentous and significant origin...with the eighth wonder of the world! <br /> <br />Peter Jackson has said that after he saw KING KONG as a child, he knew he wanted to make movies.  Who can blame him?
B0000AQS0F|5.0|in this short lived tv series.  At first I was wary of a sci-fi/ western show but soon got hooked.  The anti-hero theme seems to be a favorite of Joss Whedon's but no complaints here.  Once again he makes women a force to be reckoned with and I found that the \\"Companion\\" character (a whore) who was the most respectable person as far as society was concerned in this ensemble cast was pure genius.  All of the universal themes of honor, love, betrayal, friendship and man's role in society are here and comedy threads them all together in riveting tv format.  The character of Jayne (resident macho tough guy) was especially laugh out loud funny.  I watched the series and mourned the loss when Fox cancelled this show along with everyone else, so I was very happy to be able to get all of the episodes in this complete series dvd.  It was great to be able to watch every episode, even the three unaired ones.  However, I was a little disappointed in extras included in this set.  I missed the lack of commentaries the most.  Overall, a bargain since this set will be sure to inspire repreated viewings!
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Please ignore the other reviewers who call this \\"treacle.\\"  Obviously, people like Enya's sound or not.  Stylistically the music of Enya will always sound....well, \\"Enya.\\"  I really believe, however, that this album is one of Enya's most original since Watermark.  LESS THAN A PEARL is totally unique and captivating in the way it moves along at a rapid pace and is akin to celtic mouth-music.  LONG LONG JOURNEY is totally anthemic and hymn-like.  This song absolutely gave me the chills and is incredibly moving.  WATER SHOWS THE HIDDEN HEART may be one of Enya's best of all time...her vocals are explosive and shimmering and the melody is gorgeous. I do not mind that Enya has used \\"loxian\\" on three of the tracks...Adiemus and Lisa Gerrard have used sounds instead of real language for some time, and to me, it is appropriate for the music.  There is no \\"pretention\\" in inventing an imaginary language for one's art--look at Tolkien.  I think it is refreshing.   <br />The production is excellent, and Enya's voice sounds better than ever.  I WOULD, however, agree that some of the instrumentation is a bit old school.  Other than that, though, this album is phenomenal.
B000065BPB|4.0|Most of my friends had never heard of Sennheiser.  A few even told me, that I should've bought a Bose, since I spent USD One hundred on these Sennheisers.  Bose's triport headphones were my first choice too (since I didn't know any better then).  After seeing the flimsy band, which looked eager to snap in half, I returned them, and got the Sennheisers. <br /> <br />They're heavier than the Bose Triport, but after a few minutes of wearing them, you get so used to them, that they feel quite natural.  The ear cups are soft and supple, that it really pads the skin from any rough feeling.  It feels awesome to wear for several hours at a stretch.  I use it for hours while programming away at work.  It cancels outside noise by a lot, even with the passive cancellation - its that well insulated.  Turn the music on, and even at low volumes, you're well isolated from your environment - its all crystal clear music. <br /> <br />The crystal-clear highs and mids, make me listen to all my old CD's and iTunes MP3s over and over.  The only complaint I have, is that bass is not this pair of headphones' strong points.  Bass is controlled and for songs such as Hotel California (Eagles) and Fast Car (Tracy Chapman), the sound is amazing, very tight bass and crystal clear bass.  But, for any kind of hip-hop or other bass-heavy music, this is not the headphones for you.  Since I only very rarely listen to hip-hop, I don't find this bothering at all.   <br /> <br />In short, this is one heck of a good deal - great style, awesome build, comfort, clarity and substance.  I took off 1 star for the lacklustre bass performance.

0316666343|5.0|A great book that deserves all the praise it gets. If someone tells you this book isn't good, then he or she hasn't read it yet. <br /> <br />Susie Salmon is a believable and sympathetic character and I found myself feeling for her throughout the novel. Alice Sebold takes great care in what she is saying about her characters and how that reflects on real life. One thing that's really great about the book is the poem that's read whenever the father is in the hospital. It comes at the perfect time. The only bad thing was that things seem to wrap up too neatly in the end--which took away from the believability of Susie being able to do all the things she did from heaven. <br /> <br />I'm looking forward to what Alice has in store for us in the future. I think it's amazing how she turned a crime that happened to her in her past into so much great writing. The Lovely Bones could be a classic.
B0002OERI0|5.0|For those looking to consider themselves and their world, this album is a musical take on that process, and its authors along with us on that journey, sharing their own take/perspective. <br /> <br />For those just wanting to hear something loud, or something that reflects/enhances their mindlessness, this album is a \\"sellout,\\" pretentious offering; how dare a band ask us to go along with them on a journey of consideration of our state and age? <br /> <br />That kind of talk/effort should only come from...from, WHO exactly? <br /> <br />Get me? <br /> <br />When you see this album, you see the best and worst of your own self; in that way, it's subversive and transformative, which is what the best art always is. <br /> <br />5 stars.

0684824906|5.0|Lincoln is arguably amongest the most heavily written American presidents and rightfully so.  He brought a silent and profound manner of dealing with national political calamaities that perhaps only Franklyn Delano Roosevelt was able to replicate admirably some 100 years later.  Mrs Goodwins approach and writing style are a composite mix between Chernow (Alexander Hamilton) and McCullough's (1776 and John Adams).  Her insight adds an admirable dimension to President Lincoln that I was not prevy to prior to reading this biography.  For example, Lincoln had a foundness during his presidency for Euclidean geometry having read and performed exercises on books 1-6.  Lincoln's demeanor often conflicted with his  personal outside appearance (appearing sad, depressed but then a moment later would tell spellbindinng joke often with a lesson to be learned.  Lincoln was also very patient always with a constructive motive.  Example, his Secretary of the Treasury-Chase  entertained the strong desires of becoming President and inflicted upon Lincoln often severe open criticisms to the public.  These criticisms were vicious and many times exaggerated  only to grace a better appearance for Chase.  This was consummated with Chase resignation delivered on four seperate occassions with all four times Chase assuming he was too important to be allowed to leave Lincoln's cabinet.  But finally his welcome was outgrown its usefulness and Licoln unexpectantly allowed him to leave the administration. However, Lincoln respected his judicial prudence and several months later made him Chief Justice of the  Supreme Court.  Such a fortunate reversal of opportunity would not occur in America in 2005.  But all the nuances of his decision making are properly captured and presented in enlightening detail and prose.  Additionally, at the time of Lincoln assasination I was unaware of the almost successful attempt on the same day with the life of Seward (Secretary of State) and Sewards son, Fred.  Additionally,  three months prior to the end of the Civil War, Lincoln met with Stephen Davis(President of the Confederate States)  to potentiallly end the conflict with what has been called the Hampton  Road's Conference.  This was unsuccessful because Davis was unwilling to allow the conflict to resolve with the South rejoining the union become one United States.  Less than two months later Grant received the unconditional surrender of the South and Davis had then no input.  A great read and perhaps Chernow and Goodwin may either forsee the Pulitzer Prize for their 2005 effortsionally,  three months prior to the end of the Civil War, Lincoln met with Stephen Davis(President of the Confederate States)  to potentiallly end the conflict with what has been called the Hampton  Road's Conference.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is the most amazing album Madonna has ever done, I think now Ray of Light has some competition musically.<br /><br />The songs I like the most are \\"Jump\\", \\"Sorry\\", \\"Let it will be\\", \\"Forbidden love\\", \\"Get Together\\", \\"How High\\" and \\"Hung Up\\" of course...<br /><br />I recommend it to everyone, even for those who have never bought a madonna album...
B00005CDUE|3.0|Roxy had two careers:<br /><br />From 1972-75, Roxy Music were weird and very different from most rock bands of the period. They also had one of the best live acts in the UK, although this version of Roxy was not succesful in the States. Tracks 9-17 cover the great years, but strangely the Thrill Of It All one of their best songs has beeen omitted. The 1977 Greatest Hits album, which is no longer available, was a good summary of this period. In my view the live album, Viva! which was recorded 1973-75 captures them at their magnificent best.<br /><br />For some reason Brian Ferry decided to become a lounge singer and from 1979 released three dull, slow, over-produced MOR albums and used the Roxy name. Tracks 1-8 represnt this period. In my view this stuff is awful, but that is a matter of personal taste.
0679422714|3.0|In the review by John Robinson, he mentioned Dr Tsang of Oxford as \\"one of the authorities cited (a Dr. Tsang at Oxford) actually has a website which CONFIRMS the bulk of the most damning data in this book\\".  Here is the original transcript of the interview.  Dr Tsang did NOT confirm the bulk of the data, instead he thought the authors are \\"appallingly dishonest\\" in the use of sources they claimed to have accessed. <br /> <br />============================================================= <br /> <br />Oxford University's Steve Tsang says the Chiang Kai-shek archives show the KMT chief did in fact order the senior warlord in the area to hold the crossing on pain of court martial, while his 100,000-strong Central Army tried to catch up with the Reds from the south. <br /> <br />Some of the Sichuan warlord's forces arrived before the Reds at Luding, but their commander panicked as the Reds' main force arrived. He fled, leaving behind only a few of his notoriously opium-dazed soldiers to defend the bridge. The attempt to burn the bridge could not have amounted to much, as the timbers were soaked by rain. <br /> <br />\\"The Maoist story of the battle was a lie, and a huge exaggeration but there was a battle,\\" Tsang said. Above all, Tsang insists, Chiang Kai-shek did not on this occasion or, as far as the Chiang Kai-shek papers reveal, on any other occasion let the Red Army escape during the Long March. <br /> <br />Tsang said that in this case, as generally in the book, the authors had been \\"appallingly dishonest\\" in the use of sources they claimed to have accessed. \\"Mao was a monster,\\" Tsang said. \\"(But) their distortion of history to make their case will in the end make it more difficult to reveal how horrible Mao and the Chinese Communist Party system were, and how much damage they really did to the Chinese people.\\" <br />
B000AYQLX6|2.0|First off: The music sounds great. Upgrade over the original Walls on CD. <br /> <br />Secondly: A perfect example of record company greed.  <br /> <br />No CD front cover insert, cost $20.99 in local store (which I admit was a mistake - if you NEED it - get it here). There is no way considering the manner this CD is packaged that the cost should be this high. The recording costs were incurred in 74 or thereabouts and have long since been recouped. I can get a disc and a blank jewel case for under $.50 cents.  <br /> <br />This CD (remastered and all) should be priced at a minimum of half the existing cost. Every record company that does this just isn't getting the picture.
0689853637|5.0|Yet another enchantment from Mister Sabuda.  This is the fourth of his books that I've bought and each one seems more amazing.  My first buy was [[ASIN:B001PTG34W The 12 Days of Christmas Anniversary Edition: A Pop-up Celebration]] and though brilliant it seems rather simple when compared to the Winter's Tale yet the format is the same, each spread has a dramatic pop-up and then the treat (on five of the six spreads in the book) of another pop-up hidden on the right-hand page.    The paper used is basically white but this throws up the selection of other surfaces, a white stock with a snow like glitter, two different silvers, acetate (used for a waterfall effect) and several flat graphic colors.  As with the other four books I have Sabuda leaves the big surprise to the last spread, here it is a charming woodland setting with a house in the center complete with snowman and all the animals featured in the story.  This pop-up is just stunning in itself but wait there's more, pull an arrowed tab and a series of six colored lights flash in sequence on each side of the house's roof. Just magical!    The flashing lights are the icing on the cake for me and possibly tough luck for Robert Sabuda because in his next book he has to top this extravaganza.  (How about adding sounds Robert?)  Incidentally take care with the pull tab for the lights, don't pull it too hard because to get it to work you'll have to remove a little plastic strip on the back cover to activate the batteries, then the tab will turn them off and on.  Oh yes, you can replace the batteries, too.
B000BHHVPO|4.0|This DVD could be better if it incorporates some missing artists/performances (a-ha, Deep Purple, more Bryan Adams, and so on}. It will be OK to add another 1 or 2 discs. Also annoying is video quality from Philadelpia concert, which is inferior compared to the other concerts, especially London (see it in big screen, and you'll see the difference).
B00005JNX0|4.0|\\"Madagascar\\", like most of the Dreamworks animated movies, is a kitchen-sink hodgepodge. The good news is that this hodgepodge is better than anything I've seen from this outfit, and that includes both \\"Shreks\\". Kids will love these truly funny animals, while their moms and dads will get a boot out of bits that spoof everything from \\"Seinfeld\\" (a major influence on this movie) to \\"The Twilight Zone\\". <br />        The first section of \\"Madagascar\\" is set in New York City, where the four \\"zoosters\\"- Alex the lion (voice of Ben Stiller), Marty the zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett-Smith), and my favorite, Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer)- are the stars of the Central Park zoo and pampered beyond belief after the kids go home. One day, Marty decides to escape the zoo and take the train to the wilds of Connecticut. Ever see a zebra in Times Square? A giraffe on the subway? A lion emerging onto the concourse at Grand Central? Some clever animation brings old-time \\"Looney Tunes\\" tricks to the computer era as our heroes, cornered by a hundred of New York's finest, wind up in crates on a freighter, Kenya-bound. Soon, the Four Penguins- the unsung stars of this movie- start one of their wiseguy capers and hijack the ship. The four crates fall off the boat and, \\"Survivor\\"-style, wash up on the beaches of what they assume to be the San Diego Zoo- but it's really the huge island of Madagascar, where they interact with a merry band of lemurs led by goofy dancing King Julian (Sacha Baron Cohen, aka \\"Ali G\\") <br />and his skunk-like sidekick Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer).  <br />       That's the story, such as it is. The movie, however, doesn't have the well-defined characters and themes that, in my mind, Pixar will always do best. What it does have is a dizzying array of slapstick gags, a \\"Friends\\"/\\"Seinfeld\\" dialogue rhythm (at least in the NYC portion), quickie skits that touch on old TV shows (Marty surfs onto the beach to the strains of the \\"Hawaii Five-0\\" theme) and other movies (Alex talks to a soccer ball, \\"Cast Away\\"-style), and similar touches that will definitely tickle your funny bone. More than almost any computer- <br />animated movie I've seen, \\"Madagascar\\" tries- and largely succeeds- to create what its crew calls \\"more cartoon-y gags and characters\\". <br />         A good array of extra features include not only interviews with the voice cast and director/writers, but a look at the \\"stretch\\" effects that, in the words of one animator, are <br />\\"very difficult with computers\\". They're especially good on anything involving Melman, the lovably-neurotic, pill-popping giraffe. The best extra, however, is \\"The Penguins' Christmas Caper\\", which brings the four birds front and center in a very funny holiday tale. Tom McGrath, the \\"Madagascar\\" co-director and writer, also voices the penguins' leader with a very amusing New York cop-style sneer. Musical selections could be a little better- veteran Hans Zimmer's best contribution is a pulsing lion-show theme for Alex- but the use of pop/theme cues does get a little heavy-handed. I loved the penguin short's music, though: <br />two nifty \\"Jingle Bells\\" takeoffs by Brian Setzer (swing-a-billy) <br />and the Brave Combo (klezmer-ized!). As for the voices, Stiller can be overbearing and smug, while Rock seems to be a little tentative. But Schwimmer, having played a sub-Woody Allen role on \\"Friends\\" for ten years, has his lovable-mope bit down pat. Baron Cohen's peculiar Euro-Indian accent can grate, but I loved his greeting to the American visitors: \\"Hail the New York Giants!\\" Finally, there's a look at the real Madagascar and how the filmmakers replicated some of this distant island nation's one-of-a-kind fauna and flora. (Incidentally, you couldn't see \\"Madagascar\\" on Madagascar- its capital city has a million people and only one movie house!) <br />         \\"Madagascar\\" may be a Dreamworks pastiche, but it's a pretty good one. Animation buffs, New Yorkcomedy fans, and kids who love funny animal characters will all find something to laugh at.  <br />
0714843377|4.0|This is like a snapshot of the ad industry that is enlightening to outsiders and humorous (and relevant) to insiders. Paul Arden is an industry legend and this mini-book reads like a memoir the author's been writing on napkins and scrap paper for the last 30 years. There's a little bit of everything in here: jokes, observations, actual guidance, tips, lessons learned. As with the ad industry itself - which typically functions as a sarcastic, slightly macabre mirror of reality - take in this work with a sense of humor and an eye out for the real message. There's some good stuff in here.

0920668372|2.0|This book describes the unconditional love a parent has for his or her child in a way that I feel is less than ideal. It alludes to the mother's death (which isn't something I am interested in explaining to my child at this stage) and, although it is the mother in this case, makes children aware of the fact that someone could sneak into their room at night. From an adult's perspective the ideas in this book could be construed as sweet and sentimental, but this is a CHILDREN'S book and for that reason I would definitely recommend that parents keep looking (personally, I am a fan of Guess How Much I Love You).

I find Doyle to be very versatile and his music amazingly adapts to whatever is happening on the screen. I love John Williams, but a new twist is always refreshing. I think many who were disappointed were just emotionally involved with the old Harry Potter themes, and found change a bit difficult, but if you give it a chance as a musical piece, i am sure many will learn to appreciate the genius that is Patrick Doyle.

B000BPCCZA|5.0|This may be System Of A Down's best offering to the human ear. For fans and critics, your LOVE THEM/HATE THEM attitude, this album is for you.   As with every album of theirs you are taken on a journey........into sound through arrangements, to places in your mind that seem to last for hours yet the albums on average are about 39 minutes long.  Though 'Mezmerize'(it's counterpart) with its mature yet lazy attitude seemed a little hollow as a whole now seems to make sense. With 'Hypnotize' there is a sense of urgency with a big bold sound behind it. One that fully surpasses 'Mezmerize's greatest moments.  The Dualdisc adds a bit more with two videos and a somewhat lackluster look at the making of both albums.  Separate they are great albums but together they become a unique package that interlocks with wonderful artwork.  With 'Mezmerize/Hypnotize' you're traveling on a quest for knowledge. If you haven't gotten on the ride yet.....you might have missed it.......
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I loved this movie.  I didn't know anything about the T.V. Series this was based on.  I went with my kids to this movie and it was great.  The Western flavor and quick witted dialog were a huge treat I wasn't expecting.  I love the Science Fiction genre and have come to expect very low brow efforts.  This one was quite different. 5 stars from me. <br /> <br />A note for you to consider.  For some bizzare reason, some goofy Star Wars fans feel threatened by this movie and feel the need to come to forums like this and put 1 star ratings on the moive.  Here is my Amazon tip for you.  If somebody gives a 1 star rating and then runs off at the keyboard about how terrible something is and then begins to compare it to some other movie... they are usually trolls.  Click the \\"see all my reviews\\" and see what else they review.  Most of these one star wonders are morons that make up accounts just to slam a movie.  They generally only have this one review.   <br /> <br />People are odd.  I am a fan of Star Wars since the beginning when I stood in line to see it in 1977.  This movie Serenity didn't remind me of Star Wars at all really.  Are there similarities?  Sure.  You could say that about any movie in any genre.   <br /> <br />Buy the DVD and see for yourself.  20 bucks certainly isn't worth my time to come to a forum like this and cheat a rating into the system. <br /> <br />People are odd indeed. <br /> <br />5 stars for me and my wife and my 2 kids.  Maybe I should make up accounts for them so I can add stars.  bleh. <br /> <br />

I'm aware of the critics and some fans questioning about her writing skill, especially in I love New York song.  Well, don't they have the slogan I LOVE NY in new york city??  This is a hommage that madonna has made for her love towards the city..and the lyric in that song, actually i can relate myself to that because i've lived in NY before and can't get rid of the feeling and impression that i got from the big apple!! and obviously madonna is confessiong her love to the city..  the outstanding songs,though i like them all, are GET TOGETHER, SORRY, FUTURE LOVERS, LET IT WILL BE, JUMP, HOW HIGH, ISSAC, AND OF COURSE HUNG UP...    if you like pop music and want something fresher and more fun other than the ones already out there in the markets, (Oh god, there's too much R&B sh** out in the States) this one will do good for ya!!)    If this CD doesn't make you dance or groovy, then you just can't dance and are a sad and depressed person or a heavy elephant!!!    GET IT, this is a MUST BUY!!!  I hope madonna PICKS UP  GRAMMYS next year to resurrect like RAY OF LIGHT!!!!  this is totally SENSATIONAL since her TRUE BLUE album in the 80's!!!!!
B0007GAERG|1.0|Mariah Carey fans are the most immature and ignorant people on earth.  If I was Mariah I would be ashamed to have them as fans because they are reflecting poorly on her.  No wonder she refers to you idiots as her flock of lambs.   Your negative comments and attempts at starting a website dedicated to \\"ruining\\" Madonna's success (which it won't) have only started a flood gate of tons of negativity and bad reviews posted about your idol Mariah and if anything it just makes her look bad.  Your negative attempts at putting down other females artists from Jennifer Lopez to Gwen Stefani and Janet Jackson all make you look pathetic as well.   <br />Now you are posting your little comments about how Mariah is the biggest selling female artist.  Well, you need a buy a calculator because if you could add you would realize that she isn't.  It was posted that Mariah is listed as the biggest selling female artist according to the World Music Awards in the year 2000.  This information is coming from [...]  If you check this website and compare Mariah's sales to Madonna's you will see that this information is dated. For starters that was FIVE years ago.  This was stated PRIOR to Madonna releasing her album Music which went on to sell 14 million copies worldwide. Since then she has also sold another 10 million albums with her Greatest Hits Volume 2 and American Life releases.  You then stated that Mariah Carey has sold 230 million albums worldwide.  The 230 million you speak of is her total for both album AND single sales worldwide.  Under the album and single discographies for Mariah (on [...]) you will note that her total album sales are listed as 180 million and her single sales as 50 million. This is where your total of 230 million is coming from.  Now, check out the information listed for Madonna under her album and singles discography.  According to Warner Bros. Records as of earlier in 2005 Madonna has sold 200 million albums worldwide and has single sales of 75 million.  That puts Madonna's total at 275 million.  This information is all prior to Confessions On a Dance Floor and her single Hung Up which will only push her sales total even higher.  These are the facts.  Madonna's albums have not even been re-certified to reflect her higher sales in many cases.  Music (2000) for instance was last certified as 2 X platinum in America two months after it release.  It has now gone on to sell over 3 million copies in America.  So if you want to post facts then ACTUALLY post the REAL facts.
B000BB1MIC|5.0|I don't think we are watching the same series.  Emily never left Richard in order to get Loreli back, she left him because they fought about everything recently, and she was feeling usless. She was ticked at him and that was that.  Emily was her own worst enemy where Loreli was concerned.  She had her moments, which always touched me, but her moments were never at the right time, nor long enough to help her.  It was not Digger's lawsuit, it was his father's lawsuit. And everyone knew it was never going to totally ruin Richard.  He is too smart for that. <br /> <br />This series is full of real life, and totally believable people. I feel sometimes like trying to find Stars Hollow on a map!  I wish it really existed, because that is where I would move to if it did. I love this show, and I hope that it does not stop with season 6.  I also hope that when it does stop, as I suppose all series must someday, that it will end with a resolution to everyone's lives, where everything is perfect.  Sounds drippy?  Well, that is what we all need.  Hope. <br />
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|The rare film that is impervious to criticism.  If you are not drawn into the infectuous fun of this film then nothing will grab you.  This film is reminiscent of the stylings of John Wayne's work with John Ford except Ford didn't direct this picture.  The film was directed by Andrew V. McLaglen, son of Victor, who apprenticed at the feet of Ford so that may explain the similarities.  This is a handsome, sprawling, boisterous package.  The cast seem to be having a great time here and they are not remiss in letting the audience in on the fun.  Not known as a comedian John Wayne displays a deft comic touch here and not just light comedy.  At times he seems to be improvising and going for broke with some hilarious broad comedy.  It may be the presence of Maureen O'Hara in the cast who always brought out the best work from the Duke.  O'Hara is no slouch either as displayed in the film's final scenes where she is required to act in her girdle.  Good supporting cast adds to the fun.  Recommended for not only fans of the Duke but fans of great comedy.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|I can't believe what MISS MIMI is doing now!!! <br />she is asking for her fans to spend more money for her on this sh**!!! <br /> <br />All of a sudden she is putting another tra** called MIMI untra platinum edition with new songs and dvd?? <br />wasn't the first MIMI garba** enough?? <br />Come on, MISS MIMI, in the regular version, you repeated your subjects in your songs already.. <br />does she have anything new to say? <br />in every single album, she is talking about the same things over and over and over again. <br />I can't believe that her fans still call her an artist!!! <br />well, she is good at changing her partners (rappers and boy hunk bands) in every album..ha! <br />I'm sure she was so glad to throw away her husband, tommy motorla after using him for her success for the last decade!! <br />POOR TOMMY!!! <br /> <br />all her songs don't even have any depth... <br />just repeating the same topics a million times in her albums.. <br />this is no different.. <br />you have the evidence, folks!!! <br />she is putting out the same album with different versions with the same topics and s*** for more money! <br />SO SAD AND SORRY FOR HER!!! <br /> <br />even her songs are not even good anymore.. <br />people buzz about we belong together??? <br />ha, that song was no different from her songs in her previous albums, but DJs just overplayed it!! <br />and spent what?? 14 weeks on top?? <br />hell, that was due to all the stupid hiphop and R&B DJs' playing. actually GWEN sold a lot more HOLLABACK GIRL Singles than mariah's we belong but didn't spend on top like mariah did.. <br />actually that's such a shame because DJs hunks love you by marketing money that you spent!!! haha <br /> <br />anyway i give this garba** no more than 1 star for her low creativity and awful songs.. <br />songs in that are just a yawn even if she yells and screams with overrated singing range! <br />that's all i can say... <br /> <br />DON'T EVEN BOTHER BUYING THIS!!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000BM6AVA|2.0|It is very difficult to review this CD. First off, it is new, but believe me I've heard it enough to review it. First off, yes the music has changed, it has been changing for a LONG time, but that's not necessarily bad. As much as I liked the first CD, I still like songs like Roulette (and Holy Mountains on this CD). Not everything has to be grinding, up and down metal. So everyone that says they \\"sold out\\" on this CD needs to open their eyes and listen to every CD after the first one, you'll see this was coming.    My biggest problem, and it's the same problem I had with Mesmorize, is that Daron CAN NOT SING. I don't know why they felt the need to change things up like this. Serj isn't Pavarotti, but he brings so much emotion to the songs, while Daron's \\"singing\\" consists of him screaming incoherently. I was really frustrated with Mesmorize for this exact reason, and now I see they carried on this idea, much to the detriment of this CD.    Here's an analogy that might make more sense: imagine if suddenly someone started singing with Ozzy Osbourne on Black Sabbath songs. I'm not talking about Ronnie James, or David Coverdale, or Ian, or anyone like that. I mean imagine if Tony Iommi or Geezer Butler started singing half the songs with Ozzy. Would you look at things the same way? You'd probably be frustrated that Children of the Grave was now a duet, or that Iron Man now had harmonies. Of course most of you reviewing this CD are probably too young to have any idea what I'm talking about, but some people will understand this.    Don't take my word for it (or anybody's word for that matter), give the CD a listen, but I guess I just don't understand the need to bring in a far less-talented singer to supplement Serj.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|I just got Hypnotize and I've got to say that it's one of the best albums I've purchased this year. There isn't one single song that isn't not worthy of listening. The first single \\"Hypnotize\\" is a very good song and really persuaded me into buying this album. Mesmerize is also a very good album and they both are very high in my all-time favorite album list. Get this album now and you won't regret it. You'll be listening until it's over and when it's over you'll listen to it again a few more times. This album is worth noting because everything is cool and refreshing.     1. \\"Attack\\" - 8/10  2. \\"Dreaming\\" - 10/10  3. \\"Kill Rock n' Roll\\" - 9/10  4. \\"Hypnotize\\" - 10/10  5. \\"Stealing Society\\" - 9/10  6. \\"Tentative\\" - 8/10  7. \\"U-Fig\\" - 9/10  8. \\"Holy Mountains\\" - 8/10  9. \\"Vicinity Of Obscenity\\" - 10/10  10. \\"She's Like Heroin\\" - 8/10  11. \\"Lonely Days\\" - 10/10  12. \\"Soldier Side\\" - 10/10    \\"Soldier Side\\" is one of the greatest songs I've ever heard. One of the greatest reasons to get this album. It started with \\"Soldier Side - Intro\\" on Mesmerize and it ended as a masterpiece on Hypnotize. One of the greatest. Listen to this song and you'll want this album!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Look, I bought the complete series after seeing two episodes for about $30 - it was some of the best money I ever spent.  My wife and I are hooked. Knowing what I know now I would have paid six times that.  Ounce for ounce this is some of the best writing I have seen in years.  The stories are deep and immersive.  The characters bring so many levels to the series there just no place to start.  Hearing of the shows cancelation was a very sad moment indeed. Lately, it seems that studios just slap a new paint job on the same old sci-fi or worse it's some stupid reality show. I hope the studios will at least read all the feedback here and take notice - people want quality with their Sci-Fi. <br /> <br />p.s. saw the movie  - also pure gold.  Beat the hell out of that last Star Wars movie.
0684843749|5.0|I bought this book, the revised version, in October of 1998, and the original back in 1992.  I recently purchased it again for two friends who wanted to get in shape with me.  I have to say, it's still the #1 book to have, the bible of bodybuilding.  It will teach you the CORRECT way to do each exercise in the gym, and most importantly, especially for beginners, it teaches you the fundamental exercises for each body part (bench press, barbell curl, wide-grip behind the neck chin-ups, squats, etc...) which are KEY to getting in shape as compound exercises are important, and the Arnold book teaches you how to do them correctly and safely... He really emphasizes what NOT to do (i.e. - talks about bad form, and mistakes he commonly saw in the gym)... It's amazing how many people I see in the gym every day making the exact mistakes arnold talks about... I really feel as if this book can help save you from injury and give you faster results by doing the exercises properly.
B000AL730O|5.0|I almost didn't buy this CD when I read someone had difficulty loading it onto her ipod, but I held my breath, and did it anyway, and am I ever glad I did - I almost missed this gem! I had no difficulty loading it onto my computer and transferring to my ipod whatsoever. I think this is a really terrific album, I like most every song, which is rare nowdays. One of Paul's best, more introspective than anything I've ever heard from him. I have to say I am a big fan, but I think most anybody would enjoy this album.
B000002MP2|5.0|This was the first cd the my parents ever baught me when i was 8 (yes i was 8 and my parents baught me an album with monkeys flinging crap at jesus) I was just starting to get into music, mostly pop, this album started my social decline to become what i am today. This was Green Day's third album, by this point in time after a slight member change (Tre Cool isn't the origional drummer) they had started becoming the pop punk phenomenon they are today.  <br />The album starts out with \\"burnout\\" probobally one of the best openers on an album ever. With the singles that are still played on modern rock stations all over the place, they set in stone what they were going to be \\"The most influencial punk band of the past 20 years\\" I love this album i still listen to it at least once a week it's pure genius in the idiot savant type of way. Any pop-punk band out there will list green day as an influence, and dookie as the album that allowed them to do what they do. (unfourtionatley there's alot of bands that think they can do it as perfectly) This is the must have album for any fan of the pop-punk genre that will never go away, and to thoes who say that green day isn't punk or punk rock, go back and listen to early demo's and their first two albums.
B00005JLEJ|5.0|This is my favorite among Kurosawa's movies and is certainly one of the best movies of all times. Story, photography, actors, all exceed!
B000053V7O|5.0|This review is for the 2001 Warner Brothers DVD.    It's 1959 in Paris with jazz saxophonist Dale Turner (Dexter Gordon) playing in the Blue Note Club.  His stage presence seems sedated as he sits rather than stands and holds the sax rigidly through most of set, but his music is mesmerizing.  His biggest fan, Francis Borler (Franois Cluzet) isn't inside the club, but outside in the rain, listening to every note as though his life depended on it.  As a struggling graphic artist, Francis doesn't have enough money to be inside the club, but one night after Turner leaves the Blue Note, he bumps into Francis and asks the Frenchman if he'll buy him a beer and Francis gladly accommodates Turner even though it will probably cost him all the money he has to his name.      Later it becomes clear that Turner has a drinking problem and all his close friends including his landlady try to isolate him from alcohol.  The film moves on with more great sessions inside the club, but one night Dale is picked up for public intoxication and from that point on Francis takes on the role as Dale's personal caretaker and even cajoles Turner into moving in with him and his young daughter into their small apartment.  The close-knit friendship continues with Turner being clean and sober.  Near the end of the film, Turner goes to back to America with Francis tagging along but Francis' visit is short lived as he decides to return to France.    The movie is the best jazz film I've seen, and it works magic because the main character is a real professional jazz musician and not an actor and the music is live and not piped in.  Having the movie take place in this small lounge in Paris, adds international appeal, warmth and a very personal connection to this brilliant art form.  As wonderful as the movie is, too much time was devoted to Borler's obsessive relationship with Turner.  This could have been the quintessential jazz film if it had focused more on Turner's relationship with other musicians with more discussions about the mechanics of the music.  By far, the best off-stage scene in the movie is when Turner has dinner with an attractive female singer whose been a longtime friend and she reminds Dale in a voice of gratitude, \\"You were the one that taught me to listen to the bass and not the drums\\" and Turner quickly replies back, \\"You would have figured it out in 10 or 15 years anyway\\".   The other thing that makes this film so special is the intimacy of the nightclub in a time when jazz musicians seemed far more accessible.  The final scene of the movie is many years later on a large stage of an amphitheater which is commonplace for today's jazz concerts and gives older jazz fans a longing for that golden age of bebop in those small clubs with special musicians who played like Dale Turner.  This is a must-have DVD for any serious jazz fan.    The DVD presentation is does the film justice.  The color widescreen presentation is immaculate and most importantly the stereo soundtrack sounds fantastic.        Movie: A-    DVD Quality: A
B00062J00S|5.0|If there was a film that represents American ideals, it would be this film.  George Baily is the epitomy of what is best in America.  A man that tries to live with values and morals without caving into big money/corporation.  He looks out for the little guy, and when he faulters and things look dire for ol' George, the town rallies behind him and his brother, the war hero, in the end, makes a toast to him:  \\"To George Baily.  The richest man in town.\\" How could you not love a movie like that?
B000BO0LLS|5.0|This is truly Mariah's comeback album and the return of the voice!  Having been certified 4x platinum and hitting #1 for 2 weeks (with her biggest one-week opener ever) in only a matter of 7 months, this album is on its way to being the biggest album of the year!  Pair this with the fact that Mariah's been doing this for around 15 years, sold around 230 million records and has had more #1 singles and spent more days on the top of the Billboard charts than any other female artist (second only to legends like the Beatles and Elvis), and it's easy to see that this woman has got a longevity and success that no one can match. This album would be a triumph, even without the success (in sales and critically) that it has received. It marks the return of a new Mariah - one that is happy again, no longer the laughingstock she was just years ago.  Mariah also returned to the award-winning streak she was on in the `90's, winning World Music, Soul Train, Teen Choice, Vibe, and numerous other awards.  She is up for five American Music Awards and is definitely a front-runner for a Grammy award - something she has not won since her debut!      Now, there are those that have complained that there have been four versions of the album.  In reality, there are only two.  At its initial release on April 12, the regular CD and a limited edition version (digipak with a poster) were released.  Note, the limited edition is NOT a re-release as they were released TOGETHER and people clearly had a choice to buy one or the other.  As well, the CD was exactly the same - no difference between the two.  There was only need to buy ONE of these two versions.  On November 15, the album was re-released with four extra tracks (all of which are amazing, by the way) as the Ultra Platinum Edition.  Again, there were two editions of this released -  the regular CD and a limited edition version (with a DVD).  The two versions, like the original, were both released on the SAME DAY and people are again, clearly given a choice as to which to buy!  So, why would anyone buy ALL editions of the album (unless a huge fan)?  Furthermore, the limited edition of the initial release was only widely available for a little while and was released in smaller quantities than the original album.  The limited edition of the re-release is MUCH better than the regular re-release version, so why are people complaining about 4 versions of the album?  So there is no reason to complain about this issue!  The only valid complaint would be that the company is milking the album by re-releasing it ONCE (the two new versions).  There is NO validity to the argument of the album being re-released 4 times, especially since you're getting so much more each time (unlike Usher's re-release, for example)!      Also, you don't HAVE to buy the album!  If you don't feel like paying for 4 new songs, then don't!  No one is controlling you and telling you to buy the album!  In addition, Mariah said that it was going to be a while before we hear a new album and since the new tracks are so good, who would want to wait that long to get new tracks?  EP's aren't exactly cheaper either and if you don't want to pay more for \\"what you already have\\", then just download the tracks from iTunes or other legal services (when they're available).  And to those who complain she does not care about her fans - umm...she did special signing sessions for her fans and has done many appearances / interviews / performances where she sincerely thanked her fans for everything!      And WHY are people comparing Mariah and Madonna's sales?  Or comparing them at all?  Both have their fans and have achievements, yet comparing them doesn't make either less or more than the other!  Both women are completely different and generally cater to different genres - both to pop, while Mariah is more aimed towards r&b/hip-hop audiences and Madonna more to dance audiences.  And it has been stated by many (basically everywhere) that Mariah is the best-selling female of all time!  True worldwide sales cannot be determined with accuracy, so there is no way one can debate that \\"fact\\".     1) It's Like That - The opening club-banging track and first single gets your ass shaking! The heavy bass and the feel-good lyrics will make you feel \\"lifted\\" and \\"you'll like it!\\" JD's part is extremely catchy and Fatman Scoop's rap, though brief, is very effective. Mariah showcases her voice brilliantly along with his hot rap at the end. Definitely one of the hottest dance tracks of the year and a great single to kick off this mint album!  The album's kick-off single entered the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100, a huge return to the charts for Mariah (who hadn't charted in quite a while)!    2) We Belong Together - What more can I say about Mariah's 16th #1 Billboard Hot 100 single (spending an unbelievable 14 weeks at the top...second only to her '96 hit One Sweet Day at 16 weeks) and the song that set a record for MOST played song on American radio in a week?  Breaking countless other records and hitting #1 on 13 different Billboard charts (a record), this song shows you the power of Mariah and solidifies her place as the #1 female artist in the world!    3) Shake It Off - The 3rd single of the album, this track will make you \\"bounce\\"! A very light and catchy feel-good track, and hitting #2 on the Billboard Hot 100, this song will get stuck in your head in no time!     4) Mine Again - One of Mariah's best vocal performances in a long time, showcasing her near-perfect voice! Her effortless glide over the octaves is probably not as amazing as it once was, but this is the closest it's been in a long time! A true \\"song for the ages\\" as many call it.     5) Say Somethin' (feat. Snoop Dogg) - A hip-hop lover's dream: Mariah, Snoop Dogg, and the Neptunes! Hot, funky, and danceable track and extremely sexy, Mariah and Snoop have awesome chemistry in this one! `Nuff said!     6) Stay The Night - Mariah really belts in this one! One of Kanye's best, it has a 70's soul feel to it. Definitely one of the highlights on the album, again doing wonders at displaying Mariah's huge voice.     7) Get Your Number (feat. JD) - Released only overseas as a single, this is one of my favorite track of the album. Many have complained that JD is annoying and sounds like Nelly, but I think he does a great job. This is probably the best dance track on the album and the one you can see everyone clubbing to. An extremely fun song to sing along to and dance to!    8) One And Only (feat. Twista) - \\"Twista and Mariah, together like a grip on a tire!\\" These two really do fit well together and Mariah proves she can keep up with Twista's rapping in this hot and smooth track.  I thought this amazing pairing couldn't get better...that is until I heard One And Only Pt. 2 (see below for review)!    9) Circles - Another excellent mid-tempo R&B ballad with superb vocals, Mariah again samples old school music. This is definitely a song that only Mariah could pull off!  Simply amazing!    10) Your Girl - An upbeat, sexy song with more old-school vibes. Another feel-good track that'll make you sing along!     11) I Wish You Knew - A very nice ballad that many can relate to. Mariah pulls a Alicia Keys on this one and talks, while the audience applauds. Has a \\"show-y\\" feeling to it and makes you feel like you're watching this in a theatre. Again, showcasing Mariah's enormous range and control.     12) To The Floor (feat. Nelly) - The REAL Nelly is on this track and it's a very slick hip-hop track. Mariah uses a very subtle, sexy voice on this one, while Nelly goes easy on the song, not overdoing it. Hot beats and Mariah is again able to complement the rapping with her vocals.     13) Joyride - The most beautiful love song on the album and also the \\"poppiest\\" song of the album, though it also has an R&B feel to it. I think any pop artist could sing this song and I would love it, but Mariah makes it that much more special. For most of thesong, Mariah uses a very beautiful soft voice, but then belts at the end and hits some ridiculously high notes! Again, it is just lovely!     14) Fly Like A Bird - What a way to close the album (well the original version anyways)! Mariah's voice gets progressively stronger as the song goes on and it closes with a full choir. Mariah's voice simply soars on this song, filling you with joy and hope! This is Mariah at her best - her singing is almost ecstatic, a true throwback to some of her earlier stuff! Perfect!     15) Don't Forget About Us - The 4th US single from the album has been called an amalgamation of We Belong Together and Shake It Off.  Reproducing the feel and beat of We Belong Together, but also adding some \\"bounce\\" from Shake It Off (not to mention the chart and radio success of both!), this song does something even more important - it connects with people in so many ways and as Mariah says, it means something different to everyone.  It's just a beautiful song and Mariah sings with such emotion!  I definitely have a feeling that this is going to hit #1 and tie her with Elvis for number of #1 singles (17, second behind the Beatles).      16) Makin' It Last All Night (What It Do) (feat. JD) - This is a funky, sexy and fun track!  It has an urban feel to it and JD does a great job in the rapping department!  Definitely has the potential to be a single!    17) So Lonely (One And Only Pt. 2) (feat. Twista) - HOT TAMALE!  IMO, one of the best urban/hip-hop tracks Mariah has done - a song with a feel like 50 Cent's club-bangers but so much more!  Mariah lowers her voice to a sexy purr throughout the song, while Twista does what he does best!  This could definitely be another #1 hit for Mariah if released!      18) We Belong Together (Remix) (feat. Styles P. & Jadakiss) - Nothing can really top the original, but this DJ Clue mix comes close!  Starting with a soft \\"when you left I lost a part of me\\", the song speeds up and includes solid raps from Kiss and Styles, including this memorable line:  Show your respect   Whenever you hear me or see me   This is the emancipation of Mimi  Hot like a real fever, the real diva   So successful, yet still so eager...        The DVD features music videos for Mariah's four original singles from the album: It's Like That, We Belong Together, Shake It Off, and the previously unreleased (in the U.S.) Get Your Number!  The four vids represent some of Mariah's best and sexiest videos and are really works of art.  The first two were directed by Brett Ratner, while the latter two videos were done by Jake Nava.  The videos can be shown in order or separately.  The quality is excellent and the menus are simple, yet beautiful!  The DVD also has a link to Mariah's latest video (one of her best yet!) Don't Forget About Us and an interview done \\"in her own words\\"!  Both are great features, though it would have been much better if included on the DVD.  The quality of the bonus features are not that great and is quite a hassle (you need a computer and have to download some software), but still a great addition to the album!    Phew! This simply amazing album got even better! A perfect blend of hot, dance/hip-hop tracks and smooth, lovely r&b/pop ballads, with some old-school soul and gospel thrown in! I think the album is going to continue selling extremely well and I have no doubt that Mariah is going to keep on hitting the top of the charts with these excellent tracks, perhaps even reaching the Beatles and Elvis in terms of success on the Billboard charts before the end of the year! I think the verdict from critics and fans is pretty much clear: MIMI IS BACK!!!!!!
0553801503|1.0|I did not buy the book. <br /> <br />I finished reading the book at the store.  No point buying books not worth reading twice.  For anyone disappointed in the dearth of quality fantasies lately, I suggest you do the same and force publishers to take appropriate actions. <br /> <br />I enjoyed half of book 1 & most of book 3.  I prefer the practical creative mind that dared to kill off Eddard in book 1, and Tywin in book 3.  There's something akin to Gordian knots by axing such power characters - it makes the storyline suddenly more compelling knowing that the fate of the world can indeed be changed by the actions of an arrogant boy or a spited son. <br /> <br />I did not appreciate the gesture of raising Catelyn from the dead.  I did not care about Jon or Sam or Brienne, and after reading book 4, I stopped caring about Sansa and Arya also.  Cersei and company's deaths were overdue.  Sure they are not dead; they just die a different death in this reader's mind. <br /> <br />By trend extrapolation, Tyrion would be degraded to an idjit in book 5. <br /> <br />In case GRRM forgets, this is not the West Wing.  Political thrillers are for those who can't kill their enemies.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|Two words:  \\"Simply Amazing\\" <br /> <br />System of a Down has finished what they started with \\"Mezmerize\\" with the same S.O.A.D sound mixed with their new twist in their style and their growing skills.  This album is simply (pardon the cliche) a \\"must-have\\" for System of a Down fans everywhere.  Some people didn't like Mezmerize because they thought Daron sang too much.  It is the same in Hypnotize, but personally I think Daron brings a good contribution to the lyrical and vocal genius of Serj.   <br /> <br />I look around at all the other bands of today and I am beginning to realize:  these 4 men are part of the last generation of philosophers.  Enjoy them while they are still here.  Buy the CD and you won't regret it.
B00008RH1H|5.0|When it comes to film adaptations, most films fail in some way.  To think that a Japanese film director could transform one of the greatest plays written in the English language and mke it his own, is quite tremendous. To think that he could use Japanese Noh theater images to enhance the adpatation is a stroke of genius.  Mifune is one of the greatest actors to play Macbeth, and dare say maybe the best.  Akira Kurosawa directed a masterpiece and proves why he is at the top of the pantheon of great world directors.   <br />And, of course, The Criterion Collection folk out do themselves, again.  Thank goodness for them, because of it wasn't for them, we all would be missing out on great films.
B000BM6AVA|1.0|I have been a fan of SOAD from there self tittled album. And I can some up this album with the fraze WTF. I mean I wasent a very big fan of Mezmerize but the album did have it's moment's. This album I am not quite sure how to put it, is just plan bad. The album dosen't really even have a single, the single they put out \\"Hypnotize\\" is almost more of a warning than a single that the album is sub-par at best. The only song's on the whole ablum that actually have any replay value is \\"Soldier Side\\" and \\"Lonely day\\". But the rest of the album is just disapointing. It has it's moment's but they arn't entire song's they are part's of song's taking place in \\"Stealing society\\" \\"Holy Mountain's\\", \\"Vicinity of Obscenity\\", and \\"She's like herion\\". But it's as if they showing \\"what could have been but never was\\". The album itself also suffer's from short play time, as did mezmerize clocking out at just under 40 min's. The song's themselve's still carry a message, but the music in generall is lagging when saying it's SOAD. I was expecting a lot more, not a bland change over of music style to a almost Pop-Metal. The packaging is the highpoint of this album, \\"Mezmerize\\", and \\"Hypnotize\\" interlock to create a creative 2 disc box. Overall I really can't recomend this album to anyone. If you just started getting into system when Mezmerize came out , or like the single that's out. You might enjoy the album, just to the long time SOAD fan's don't expect System as you knew them.

0553801503|2.0|I don't want to go into great detail because most people reading this will have already read the book like I have.<br /><br />Pros-<br /><br />His writing is good as always and the character interaction is done well<br /><br />Cons-<br /><br />Nothing of significance happens.  I take that back, nothing of significance to progressing the story.  Sure some of this may be significant to someone......but if you step on an ant its significant to the ant only.  My point is this.  Very few things ever happen in this story.  Any battles that may have taken place in this book are skipped over in description and brought to the summary.  \\"Send loras to take dragonstone\\" Cersei's chapter ends. Next cersei chapter \\"So Aurane waters dragonstone has fallen, give me the details.\\"  The battle is never described or anything of interest.  I'm not saying that's what kills this book, but the tedium that it was to read this could have been lightened temporarily with some brief and mindless action.  Alas, he doesn't even grant me this. The only thing this books is basically all the characters finding out the events THAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST BOOK.  The new Ironborn who sits the seastone chair seems like another way to convolute the plot, to drag it on = more money.<br /><br />To george rr martin- You can keep westeros and milk it forever but could you please do it like Robin Hobb, Complete one story if you will before you drag this story on forever.  I love the world don't get me wrong.<br /><br />My favorite series thus far, dissapointed me immensely.  The years spent writing this couldn't have been put into the plot. No because there was none.  Ahh his fame brought him money and with that he took a nice vacation.<br /><br />I will stay hopeful and faithful to the next book, but if its a dissapointment, I'm done.  You're not going to sucker me, with a pathetic piece of literature, into making you rich.<br /><br />Joe
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna is truly amazing.  This new album has got some awesome tracks.  I hear a little bit of Ray of Light in it as well as the early Madonna material.  I have not stopped listening to this album since i purchased it the first day!
B000AARKOO|4.0|It had a great storyline overall. The battle scenes were superb and orlando bloom did a perfect job as a portraying a leader of the kingdom towards the end of the movie. I really didn't understand why eva green cut her hair in the movie. That was one thing i didnt understand. The soundtrack for the movie however didnt keep my attention at its best. But overall it was a great movie.
0679720200|3.0|This novel is set in Algeria and focuses on Mersault, the dispassionate Frenchmen we are forced to read about. Mersault's mother dies at the opening of the novel, although it doesn't matter since Mersault doesn't care anyway. This man is the epitome of an existensialist character, caring for nothing, about nothing, even self preservation. Mersault has a girfriend who says \\"do you love me?\\" to which he responds \\"It doesn't matter but if i had to answer i'd say no.\\" He doesn't care for her, just for the physical pleasure she provides. Just the same when he is faced with the choice of whether or not to kill a man, it followed approximetly this train of thought, \\"I could walk away, but the sun is so bright, and he's sitting in the shade, maybe i should walk towards him and try to get out of the sun; oh no he pulled a knife and the sun is so bright!\\" Without further thought he shoot the man several times in cold blood, caring for nothing except that it is hot out.  <br /> <br />When Mersault is arrested, he makes no attempt to cover up his action, or to defend it in any way, even by hiring a lawyer. Mersault's lack of emotion and his brutal honesty is what finally leads to his demise. In summation, Mersault is simply an unmotivated sociopath, who if he found he enjoyed killing could have gone on a murder rampage without a thought.  <br /> <br />I despised this novel completely because of it's lack of holding power. It's obvious that the authur didn't write the novel so that the reader could \\"like\\" the protagonist, but instead to do a study of society, and how society reacts to someone so different. Even so, how can the author expect the reader to care for a character who doesn't care for himself or anyone else, even enough to get to the end of the novel?

B000BIQKXM|5.0|After their pretty neat Ratpack collection of songs on their sixth album Allow Us To Be Frank, Westlife return to their usual routes. Trust me, if you liked albums one to six, you should have absolutely no problem what so ever with this. My favourite songs are Amazing, Colour My World, Hit You With The Real Thing and Change Your Mind. Amazing - the best out of the bunch - is exactly what it says it is. It sounds alot like a Backstreet Boys (BSB) song to me. Speaking of which, Colour My World, was originally recorded by BSB, though their version is spelt color. It's a brilliant song, and they get their voices fairly high. Hit You With The Real Thing was a immediate suprise for me. This is Westlife like you've never heard them before. It's an uptempo number, though it's not like songs like Uptown Girl or World Of Our Own at all. Change Your Mind has a feel of 70s retro pop, and the other tracks are absolutely overwhelming aswell. Get this!!
6304873441|5.0|Anastasia is one my all-time favorite movies. When it first came out I refused to see it (I was little miss Counter-Culture in the day), and that was my mistake. When I finally did come round, I fell in love! Granted, historical accuracy is sketchy at best, but that doesn't prevent it from being a wonderful show. The characters are so amiable, from adorable Bartok and dashing Dmitri to fiery Anya and coquettish Sophia. The songs are beautiful and catchy, and will stick in your head for days as you run around humming them with a smile on your lips - not surprising, as they were done by the renowned team of Flaherty & Ahrens, who wrote other such greats as Ragtime, Once On This Island, and Seussical. I highly recommend this movie for everyone, from child to adult, as there is something in it for all. And if you like this, try Bartok the Magnificent as well! \\"Das vidana, Anya my dear...\\"
B000A59PMO|5.0|I bought this DVD never seeing an episode of the show in it's first season run. I only bought it because I heard a few good things here and there, and I had some extra cash. I actually just finished it yesterday, and I must say, I loved it. This show just grabs you, and doesn't let you go. The writing is superb in this show about a young girl who is outcasted by her peers, and does detective work. The season alone is worth watching just to catch the finale episode. I'm very pleased with this purchased, and glad i decided to check it out. This show is really one of those few good shows on TV anymore. I just hope UPN doesn't decide to pull the plug on this show.
0553801503|2.0|Let me start by pointing out what some might not know.  This book is half of the book that GRRM intended to write.  He took certain chapters from that book out to make this book and the rest will make up the next book.  Unfortunately, what he really needed to do was get someone to edit the original book down instead.    A Song of Ice and Fire is a series that is often layered in complexities, but so far the interesting stuff has come in such large doses that the complexity hasn't outweighed the interest factor.      I'm sorry to say that this book is more complex than interesting.  The amount of throwaway characters in the book is unwieldy.  There are over fifty pages of lists of the various factions and their associated personages in the back of the book and I really did need those at times.      There is a more narrow focus on the Westeros factions in this book with the Lannisters and Martells getting a lot of chapters.  Many of these characters and their followers share similar names or even sometimes the same names and then GRRM mixes names with titles and it starts to get even more headache inducing. All this would probably have been forgiven if the majority of the book held my interest, but often I found myself skimming over the listings of bannermen, nobles or followers trying to keep moving along.    Then there are the individuals we follow in this book.  Jaime and Cersei Lannister get a large share of this book and they are just damned annoying.  Jaime is screwed up over his hand being chopped off and his father dying and Cersei is just completely amoral and nuts as she takes over as Queen.  Their inner dialogue often gets repetitive and predictable, especially Cersei.    Brienne of Tarth also gets a large share of the book as she tries to search out Sansa Stark.  The problem is that we know she isn't going to find Sansa where she is looking, so often it seems like her plotline is going nowhere.    Sansa is still in the Eyrie with Littlefinger and not muchhappens there for most of the book.  Arya is in Braavos and her chapters are some of the more interesting ones, but she doesn't make up for the various Greyjoy family members we have to follow around in the book.  They just don't fill out as characters very well.  They're too one-dimensional.    Overall, there is a lot of plotting and maneuvering in this book and not much action.  There were several plotlines that just felt like filler in this one, plotlines that could have been summed up in a few lines of dialogue somewhere else. I'm afraid the book just doesn't hold together as well as the past books.  Except for Cersei and Jaime most of the characters never interact with each other, in turn the storylines feel very disconnected from each other.  Here's hoping the second half of this novel works better.
B0002OERI0|4.0|Don't get me wrong. Green Day are great entertainers, and their American Idiot album is by far - most likely - their finest effort since Dookie back in 1994, along with their new album, Bullet In A Bible. My favourite songs are Boulevard Of Broken Dreams, St. Jimmy and Wake Me Up When September Ends. Broken Dreams and September Ends are absolutely Green Day at their best! If every song on the album was like this, we'd have an even better corker than we already do, as well as a five star rating instead of four. St. Jimmy is extremely fast-paced, as are the vocals, though it's an incredibly catchy song. The album also includes the hits American Idiot and Holiday. I prefer Holiday out of the two, though they are both good songs. The other tracks, especially the rock opears, are fantastic and satisfying. The lowlights, though they are still good songs - just not as good as others, are Whatsername and Give Me Novacaine. If you were to buy a Green Day album, buy Bullet In A Bible, as the live tracks are amazing, plus you get the DVD with most of the concert, so it's worthwhile. American Idiot, meanwhile, shows a promising future for Green Day, and this nine million-selling worldwide album will go onto be a classic in atleast ten years time.
0385336810|4.0|Aside from it being slightly predictable, and a little tough (only for the first chapter or so) to get into, I adore this book and it's always the book I go to read when I need reassurance on love. Sappy, but all true!
B000BM6AVA|5.0|Don't listen to anyone who says hypnotize is disappointing. I couldn't disagree more, because hypnotize is far superior in many ways to any soad album ever released.  track 6 \\"Tentative\\",  is so emotional, it has to be the most passionate, and moving song I have ever heard.  And songs like \\"attack\\", \\"Vicinity of Obscenity\\" are very energetic and hard, but also contain deep choruses.  The second version of Soldier side is probably the 2nd best song on the album, it has a unique verse, and in the chorus the bass and guitair play together beautifully.  Hypnotize is the darkest , most complex, emotional, and ambitious album system of a down has ever completed.  If you like good bands like tool, deftones, radiohead, alice in chains, and pink floyd, than I promise you, hypnotize will not disappoint you.  Its a lot better than mezmorize.  I guess this album is just too good for some simpleminded people to understand.

B0007GAERG|1.0|Seriously, folks. This album is nothing special at all. Mariah used to be good. In the 1990s, she was the best selling female at the time. Celine Dion and Whitney Houston had to stand aside - even Madonna had to stand and watch Carey sell more records. (That's now changed. Madonna has outsold Mariah - ask the Guiness Hit Singles And Albums book.) If you're looking for a better artist than Mariah, go to Celine. She is one of the many Canadian superstars (others include Shania Twain, my personal favourite Daniel Powter and many others). She is Mariah without the annoying hip-hop and the guest rappers standing beside her. The highlights here are the singles, and Say Somethin'. The other tracks don't get my attention much. This is a somewhat average effort, though I've given it one star due to my dissapointment in comparison to other Mariah albums. Mariah has a brilliant voice - she's just not using it in the best way she can
B00005JN0T|4.0|I must first say that for the most part I am not a Will Smith fan in terms of movies.  I did like the Men in Black motif.  In terms of I Robot I was surprised with this one because initially I did not think it was going to be that good of a movie.  I must say that I stand corrected and I really liked this movie.  I don't want to give away the plot, but the concepts that this movie presented in terms of artificial intellegence and the potential affects of AI evolution, of course leads to revolution as nice.  I also like the conflict between characters, although I do feel that Del Spooner's (Will Smith) prejudice of robots did not have a deep enough motive.  The idea that a robot in his mind would steal a purse, simply because a robot saved him instead of a child in the past, did not seem to be a logical jump.  Yet, the movie has nice blend of action and suspense.  I enjoy watching and re-watching this movie.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Despite being only 13 years of age, I remember being a Madonna fan since I was 6. As soon as I saw her Frozen music video, I was immediately attracted. I went out and bought Ray Of Light straight away, then ended up with Like A Prayer a few months later, and before I knew it, I had all of her albums. On Confessions On A Dance Floor, Madonna teams up with the fantastic, one and only Stuart Price, to form fantastic beats over excellent vocals. There's an Abba sampling (Hung Up), a Donna Summer sampling (Future Lovers), and whoever liked Madonna's early 80s disco music (Physical Attraction, Everybody, Burning Up, etc...), believe me, you're in for a treat. Of course, everyone has their favourites. The highlights for me are Sorry - the rumoured second single, the Kallabah-ish song Isaac, and the I don't care, in your face effort which is Like It Or Not. Seriously though, they are all great songs, which will surely get Madonna back on her reigning throne. There's no quibbles in this one, I suppose because the album is just too strong.
B0002KVUKW|3.0|I bought Van Helsing on DVD and really enjoyed it when I first bought it.  I watched it a number of times and still continued to like it, but I also recognize a number of flaws in the movie.  Most of the flaws I feel the movie has are in character development and to much information that is presented and never solved, and because it is a movie and not a TV series this can become problematic.  Some aspects of the special effects were nice.  The main problem area with the speical effects is in the final fight scene where it just looks to fake.<br /><br />Yet, all in all I enjoyed this movie and am glad that is a part of my DVD library.  I would say that it is a worth while buy, especially if you can get it used.  Because it is a sci-fi roller coaster ride type of movie, don't expect oscar performances, but non the less a good flic.
B00005Y228|5.0|Fever is Kylie's best album, HANDS DOWN! As well as being her most popular, Fever is already a classic album and it's an incredibly catchy dance album. It would have to be up there with the likes of dance classics such as Madonna's Confessions On A Dance Floor and Cher's Living Proof. From the beginner More, More, More, down to the hit that bought Kylie back into motion, Can't Get You Out Of My Head, down to the fantastic closure, Burning Up, the album is an amazing one. My favourites are Love At First Sight, Dance Floor and Your Love. Of course, the rest of the tracks are fantastic by all means. Love At First Sight is definately the best single release from Fever - just slightly better than Can't Get You Out Of My Head. Following, In Your Eyes and Come Into My World are also fantastic. I really enjoy the title track, too. This is Kylie's biggest selling album to date for her yet, and deservedly so. If you are to buy one, and one only, Kylie album, this is it. That being said, do I recommend it? YES!!!
B000BM6AVA|5.0|This album sounds like a heavier version of Mezmorize. And thats a good thing. Attack is awesome,along with Hypnotize and a few others and I really like the 2nd version of Soldier Side, my only gripe is that Serj only wrote the lyrics to one song by himself(Vicinity of Obscenity) Did Daron just take over the band now and/or is Serj just lazier with age? Overall, still great album.
B0009RJPC8|4.0|James Blunt is definately a winner. His music is fantastic, he is definately something new, since all the hip-hop in the business today, and certainly a breath of fresh air. From the amazing opener High, to the massive hit You're Beautiful (possibly the biggest song of the year in the U.K), and most of the other songs, you'll definately like the melodies. Speaking of melodies, Out Of My Mind is so catchy and definately one of my favourites. I also love Tears And Rain, Goodbye My Lover, and of course, You're Beautiful. Like I said, High is brilliant, and So Long Jimmy, Billy, and Over My Shoulder are fantastic, too. The other song, No Bravery - the closure, is somewhat an average effort, and not up to the standards of the other songs from the album. However, this is a minor quibble, especially when the rest of the album is incredibly strong. Give it up for James!
0099478935|5.0|There are few books which combine the complete worthlessness of the UN and how the West's liberals will never understand the death and destruction they cause in the name of \\"peace\\" than this book does.  <br />While Pedro Sanjuan's recent book \\"The UN Gang\\" does a good job of showing what a totally corrupt and ineffective organization the UN is. Dallaire's book shows that the UN is actually a much more dangerous organization because it allows people to view it as an answer instead of part of the problem in dealing with global terrorism.  <br />But the reason that this book will never become a movie like \\"Hotel Rwanda\\" did, was it shows that the West viewed the slaughter of 800,000 men women and children in a three month period to not be worth the life of a single Western soldier to prevent an easily preventable holocaust. This book is staggering in its indictment of the \\"first black President\\" to be more than just a petty adulterer. He was a someone willing to let hundreds of thousands die just because they were black, and the polls showed that his \\"legacy\\" might be damaged if he had yet another foreign failure as he had in Mogadishu. But the other lesson of this book is that you can get away with allowing genocide to occur instead of taking a stand as long as you have the press on your side, and you build a museum or memorial as we did in the US to lament man's inhumanity to mankind. Just look at what has happened to George Bush's principled view of not allowing evil to continue in Afghanistan or Iraq where hundreds of thousands were murdered at whim by the new generation of Nazis such as the Taliban or the Baathists compared to the glowing reviews of Clinton who turned his eyes away from one of the greatest slaughters of mankind in order to delude the world into thinking that it was a problem that could be ignored without any guilt. Peace in our time, indeed. <br />A stunning book. <br />
B000BO0LLS|1.0|Besides thinking the original version of The Emancipation Of Mimi was a average effort and somewhat dissapointing compared to other Mariah albums (Music Box, Daydream, and despite being hip-hop, Rainbow are my favourites), the fourth, yes, fourth, version of the album is another pleed from Mariah for more money. I like Mariah's new song, Don't Forget About Us, and I like So Lonely - it's definately an improvement on the original One And Only. More over, Makin' It Last Night (What It Do) is a better effort than most of the songs from the original album. The remix of We Belong Together, sadly, doesn't live up to the fantastic original. The videos are nice. It's Like That is glam, We Belong Together tells a story - a good one, Shake It Off, admit it, people, is quite hot, as is Get Your Number. The interview is nice. The bonus tracks on the album are worth 4 stars (one deducted for the awful mix of We Belong Together), and the original tracks are mediocre, and worth 3 stars. Due to my dissapointment compared to other Mariah albums - and the shock - I narrowed the rating down to 2 stars. Furthermore, the rip-off idea and cash-in to get more money, made me push down to 1. Like I said, Mariah has a great voice - she's just not using it in the right way. Pity, because this album COULD have been good...
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Confessions On A Dance Floor is perhaps the first album since her debut to be so consistently great, track-by-track. Unlike other albums people often put forward as her best--Like A Prayer and Ray of Light, for instance--there isn't a weak song on the album. Let me go through each one... <br /> <br />Hung Up: Surely, you've heard this by now. The ABBA sample is some of the most effective sampling I've heard in dance music; it's simple, instrumental, and blends perfectly with the chorus. One thing that's often missing in mainstream attempts at electronica is moments of really slowing it down, having sections of the song that break down the song and give it a chance to breath and meditate before building to a hard, killer beat. This is something DJ's do constantly in actual clubs and raves but is usually absent in mainstream dance CD's, but this song does it and does it well, with a lot of tick-tocking. <br /> <br />Get Together: This is the first of a series of more ambient, vocador-heavy songs. She repeatedly goes for a style of electronica that is most well-known in hits like Stardust's The Music Sounds Better With You but was actually pretty widespread in 90's electronica. It is a vaguely emotional but also somewhat detached style of ambient electronica, and she (largely thanks to Stuart Price) surpasses the vast majority of the stuff in that style that was going around in the 90's. <br /> <br />Sorry: This is probably the best song on the album. It's one of the all-time best tell-off/break-up club anthems. Anyone who listens to a lot of house music knows how many diva vocal driven dance songs have come out over the years with the same message: I'm so over you, I'm such a strong woman, so get out of my life (I'm paraphrasing, of course, but there are countless songs like this). This is one of the best ones anyone's ever done. <br /> <br />Future Lovers: This is another one of the ambient electronica songs. These generally aren't meant to be as single-oriented, since they're influenced by a style that never broke into the mainstream. This is a better example than Get Together, in my opinion, because it uses Madonna's always-great spoken word sexy muttering and also has a very original, quirky central melody. <br /> <br />I Love New York: Unlike most New York tribute songs that are naively optimistic and upbeat, this song conveys the edgy feeling of the actual city with its hard, aggressive beat. The production is similar to that of Basement Jaxx's album Rooty, and she expresses her love for the city by capturing its grit (despite her apparent unwillingness to use the actual f-word). Much more effective, in a way, than other New York tributes. <br /> <br />Let It Will Be: Great production, excellent example of bringing together a simple, strings melody with a dance beat. Some people say the strings are from Papa Don't Preach, but that's not true. <br /> <br />Forbidden Love: Another one of the ambient songs. This has a beautiful melody and is more emotional than the previous ones. People say this album has no meaning, but here we see that, at times, it's just as emotional as her other albums, just in a more subtle style. <br /> <br />Jump: I believe this may be a single... It's not quite on the level of Sorry, but it's easy to imagine this being a huge anthem that you hear at every club you go to. <br /> <br />How High: Originally written for a musical Madonna planned to star in, this is a lot better than most of the \\"the trouble with being famous\\"-type songs. Unlike Substitute For Love, for instance, it's not about wallowing in self-pity, and it just has a very strong melody. <br /> <br />Isaac: This one was controversial for some reason. I don't understand why. Basically, she got a guy to do some religious chanting/singing and built a dance song around his little chant. Similar to Shanti/Aghanti from Ray of Light but probably stronger overall and more danceable. It is actually pretty effective in making you feel very spiritual without sounding at all preachy or self-righteous. Yet again, some great use of strings and spoken word. <br /> <br />Push: This has harder, hip hop oriented verses and a slower, more emotional chorus. Actually the verses sound like choruses, so it's one of these songs that feels like it's alternating between two equally catchy hooks. <br /> <br />Like It Or Not: This is probably the best closer of any of her albums. As many have pointed out, it's downtempo, but when this album ends and you hear the central lyrics of this song, you feel like she's really made her case for being the best pop star in the world. She sings \\"This is who I am / You can like it or not / You can love me or leave me / But I'm never gonna stop.\\" And after over 20 years of great pop music and at the end of one of her most consistent albums, those lines really sum it up perfectly. She's not trying to win everyone over, she's just being the pure pop star that she was when she started. And the reality is that she does it better than anyone in the world, and I can't think of anyone else who could put out such a consistent piece of pop music in the third decade of their career.
B00003CX8U|4.0|All That Jazz is a semi-autobiographical film about director, choreographer, and dancer Bob Fosse. Fosse was a Chicago native who used tour with vaudeville groups until he made it to Broadway. As a choreographer, he was well known for his sexualized movements and penchant for fishnets and bowler hats. The movie stars Roy Schneider as Joe Gideon cum Bob Fosse-- a chain-smoking tyrant of a choreographer with an ego as huge a his sexual appetite for women. Roy Schneider does a great job of assuming the sinewy characteristics of a life-long dancer.<br /><br />Bob Fosse co-wrote and directed All That Jazz. ATJ gives us a peek inside the genius of Fosse. It is a fantastical story told as part musical, docudrama, and camp. (When Joe Gideon's alter-ego leans in beside the real Gideon, in bed after heart surgery, and whispers \\"cue hospital hallucination, you know, finally, that this is no ordinary flick.) Fosse skewers not only the financiers of Broadway musicals and the women he bedded, he also sticks it to himself the hardest. Gideon is such a jerk that when he is faced with a heart attack from years of drinking, screwing and pill-popping, you can't decide if you want him to live or die.<br /><br />All that Jazz is a movie that requires concentration with the quick cuts from Joe's present to his past and into his imagination. There are also several viewings of Joe's daily routine (The routine consists of Joe popping a pill, using eye drops, taking a shower, shaking the pain out of his wrist, and then facing himself in the mirror to utter \\"Show time.\\"). At first, the repetitions come off as annoying but eventually you realize it is a comparison of learning a dance. You repeat and repeat and repeat until you get it right. (And once it hits the stage, you repeat and repeat and repeat for 8 shows a week.) The theme of repetition and perfection come up in the film often.<br /><br />Joe is working on a film project that is overdue to the movie company ( in real life it is a version of Bob Fosse's biographical film Lenny based on the life of comedian Lenny Bruce). He relentlessly watches the draft over and over again finding every flaw but never finding what good is in it. From every dance that is rehearsed ad nauseum to the parade of women that come in and out of Joe's life, his mere existence is about repetition until perfection but he never finds it. This movie, however, is as close to perfect as a bio-pic can get (witty, sexy, good music, great dancing, excellent acting).<br /><br />All that Jazz also takes me back to the late 70s and early 80s when Broadway musicals seemed to having a revival in NYC. I fondly remember seeing commercials on television for Evita, Dreamgirls, A Chorus Line, Annie, La Cage Aux Folles and other favorites. I also remember hearing songs from those musicals played on the radio--re-edited and discofied for everyone. All that Jazz and Cabaret melded into one for me as kid. Life, theater, and the movies were just one big song and dance routine.is a version of Bob Fosse's biographical film Lenny based on the life of comedian Lenny Bruce).

B000002J6H|3.0|If you leave out the Up-With-People choruses and the sophomoric politics of America's Children, then this album is pretty damn good. There's no Bluebird or Suite Judy Blue Eyes here, but there is some incredible picking, great songs, and an overall vibrance found lacking in Crosby and Nash's albums.    There just aren't too many artists who could have a Latin-flavored hit single, a gorgeous folk ballad, a guitar-choking acoustic blues workout, a jazzy organ number with Hendrix on-board, AND an Albert King-inspired strut that featured one of Eric Clapton's best recorded solos, and all on a debut solo album. It was a sign of the times that a work so diverse could end up in the #2 spot for the year.     Mr. Stills did go a little too far, though, by over-polishing this effort, and by having everybody who was on the block that day sing in an overblown gospel chorus style.    Stephen Barncard, engineer for C,S& N, has said that Jimi Hendrix played an incredible solo on Love The One You're With, but Stills erased it, and put steel drums on instead. It was the last thing Jimi ever recorded. It's this sort of thing that gets Stills in trouble with the critics.
0525948023|5.0|This book was a fresh reminder on the basics and added new depth to them. Much of the material is extracted from his various talks over the years, now focused in a dynamic stream of thought...a satsang on paper and ink. Inspirational reading that acted like a Zen whack on the head. Now...living it!
B00005JO1P|4.0|I have never been a big fan of country music, but Johnny Cash has always skated over music borders; maybe this is why I've always liked him and his music. I never knew anything substantial about his life or marriages or personal demons, but for most of my life, it's been his music that's saved his appeal for me!<br /><br />I wasn't looking forward to the story/biography in this movie so much as I was the music. And even though I knew at first note, it wasn't the real Johnny doing the singing, it was close enough for me to enjoy those same songs over again. I can't verify the authenticity of the movie content, but I sure know those songs! I never knew Reese Witherspoon had such a singing voice, either.<br /><br />Can you imagine sitting at the same show that featured Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Elvis Presley? I just wish I was able to see it at the time. Now that Johnny's gone, I cherish his music all that much more.
B000B8QEZG|3.0|Ok, so when I think of a \\"Dance\\" album, I think of songs I can dance to.  Many of the songs from Madonna's early days qualify: Vogue, Holiday, Borderline, etc.  Sorry, but I just can't see too many people dancing to the songs on this album.  This album claims to be \\"ballad-free\\" but really I think there are still some songs with ballad-type lyrics except they have a slightly faster beat to them.  That doesn't make them \\"dance\\" music automatically, in my opinion.<br /><br />I don't know what she was thinking with track 5 \\"I love New York\\".  Many people have posted similar opinions of the lame lyrics rhyming \\"New York\\" with \\"Dork\\".  I suppose there aren't too many better choices...pork? cork? fork? torque?  But then she pulls out all the stops when she goes for the triple rhyme: \\"sad\\" \\"glad\\" and \\"mad\\".  Wow, pure genius.  Seriously I think a 5 year old could come up with something more creative.  Hmm, maybe her kids wrote the song?  And since she lives in England, I was surprised to hear her sing \\"Paris and London baby you can keep\\".  She swears a couple times in this song too, beware parents.<br /><br />I kind of wish they hadn't blended the songs together this way to make a \\"nonstop\\" cd because I think I want to make a mix mp3 cd with all my favorite Madonna songs and listen to them in random order.  Good thing iTunes lets me specify the start and end times for each song so I can cut out some of the odd sounding overlap.<br /><br />That being said, this is still a pretty good cd.  Tracks 1 \\"Hung up\\", 2 \\"Get Together\\", and 8 \\"Jump\\" are the best.

B00006JU7T|1.0|Hi.. <br />Let me start by saying to those who haven't seen this movie yet: Just avoid it, and don't be fooled by all those positive reviews. <br />I was fooled by the posiitve reviews in here, and i thought a movie with Pacino must be as good as these reviews, well, its not. <br />I can understand that people who saw it back then (70s) must've found it a great movie, and im sure it was. But we have entered a new mellinnium, and this movie cannot compete with today's modern movies. <br />Don't get me wrong, cause i like alot of 70s movie, but this just is'nt one of the good ones. <br />This movie has aged, it had a poor plot, a poor editing, it had multiple characters with no goal, and a boring plot line. <br />The only good thing is Pacino's acting, he was good as usual, but even his acting could'nt save this movie from sinking. <br /> <br />I gave one star only for Pacino's acting, but for the rest, well a fat Zero. Take my advice and avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br />
B00005YU1O|5.0|Waking Life is not for everyone.  Its originality will put many people on the defensive from the very beginning.  In other words, the average moviegoer will find the jumpy-animation, the philosophical meanderings, and the deeply camouflaged plot, to be negative rather than positive aspects of this film.  I have enjoyed other works by Richard Linklater, but this film is among my top twenty-five all-time favorites.  It is a movie that I recommended to a good friend with the caveat: \\"Enjoy this or not, but you must watch it twice; then I'll buy you a dinner to discuss it over.\\"

B000B8QEYC|4.0|After hearing this album, I'm beginning to think you can <br />impose any Enya lyrics over any Enya music and no one will  <br />know the difference. I like the album still, for it's  <br />mood qualities, typical of Enya's work. Something new <br />I can relax to anyways. <br />Enya needs to discover some new instruments though. <br />Or perhaps title her albums part 1., part 2.....etc.. <br />
068987474X|1.0|Aside from the half hearted attempts by the author to make the reader feel mediocre about their physical appearance, this book is a great way to ruin a woman's self confidence. The authors produce a few valid points, but overall I felt they were saying, \\"Give up on men because none of them like you.\\" I feel bad for the young, impressionable minds who read this book and have their self-esteem and confidence detroyed.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|I'm totally in love with this album!  Madonna's new album is very high energy, body moving, and strong.  My favorite tracks were \\"Hung Up\\", \\"Sorry\\", \\"Get Together\\", \\"Jump\\", \\"Forbidden Love\\", \\"How High\\", and \\"Issac\\".  This album was well put together and it's a must have whoever doesn't have this album.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|I would like to say that this first album by the John Mayer Trio is way beyond just being a live album...its actually a completely brand new album by a brand new group with brand new songs that just happens to be live. This was done on purpose so we could all capture the real escence of the group which is their live performance. There are some people who like to say that John Mayer has no right to play the blues or soul music since he wasnt troubled during his growing up years. All i can say is that those who say that should probably ask B.B. king, Buddy Guy, Clapton, Herbie Hancock, John Scofield, etc... because if they think that he is good enough! then that is good enough!  <br /> <br />The album starts off with a rocking hendrix style tune called \\"who did you think i was\\" which inmediately shows us the amazing combination of guitar, bass and drums that the band members can make. There are other songs like gravity and vultures that are just simply very soulful, we can find a couple of old john mayer songs that have been reworked into the new trio format (Daughters and Somethings Missing), and finally 2 cover songs That are both from excelent artists and i believe that the tribute is well payed. But my favorite songs are Good Love is on the Way and TRY.  These songs capture really combine all the elements Soul, Rhythm, kicking guitar, great melody and lyrics.  <br /> <br />I recommend picking up this album because you will enjoy it from beginning to end.
B00005JM1F|4.0|Andy, if I'm not mistaken the song your thinking about is an acoustic version of 'Here I go again' by Whitesnake.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|These are just a few of the words I can use to sum up this album. <br /> <br />Enya shines yet again, please don't make us wait to long for the next album. <br /> <br />Since the first time I listened to orinoco flow I have been hooked.
B00005MP58|5.0|I'm a historian and author of history (\\"CALIFORNIA PIONEERS\\"), so what do I do to give myself a \\"holiday\\" without leaving the house? I reach for this superb version of Jane Austen's best-loved tale of history, romance and intrigue.<br /><br />This version's backdrop is a countryside rich with the splendor of a time forgotten... a time when one's station in life was all one had to get by on...a time lost in the hustle and bustle of modern lifestyles. The scenery is eye candy and the acting is the best to come out of the U.K. in decades. This is a masterpiece adaptation that truly does justice to Jane Austen's original novel. That said...get this movie for yourself and share it only with others whom you are absolutley postive will return it!
0553801503|2.0|The Phantom Editor <br /> <br />When \\"The Phantom Menace\\" was released a few years ago, everyone expected it to be on of the greatest films they'd ever seen.  However, this was unfotunately not the case.  It was simply not a very good movie.  I really *wanted* to like the movie.  I really did.  But when I found myself needing to search for positives in order to combat the overwhelming list of negatives, I realized it was time to concede defeat.  There were/are still some holdouts that say things like \\"This was a transition movie\\" or \\"Even the greatest filmmakers can't make every movie their greatest\\" or \\"Expectations were set so high, it was doomed no matter how good it was\\".  These are theoretically valid arguments, with the only problem that they are false.  The movie just isn't that good - period. <br /> <br />Also unfortunate is that this is exactly how I feel about Feast for Crows, the latest in Martin's juggernaut series.  I really want to like this book.  In fact, I really really really want to like this book.  I've been able to do nothing but sing the series' praise from the mountaintop since I first started reading it several years ago.  But once again, I find myself searching for positives, which is a clear indicator that the book has issues - huge issues.  Just think - did the thought ever, ever cross your mind after finishing Storm of Swords - \\"What are some positive things about this book?\\"  No - it would be a completely unneccesary exercise, to the point of absurdity.  Not so here.  I now find myself remembering \\"moments\\", and that's a crying shame. <br /> <br />\\"This is a transition book\\".  Several reviewers have made this statement.  It reminds me of the phrase \\"street smarts\\".  Just what are \\"street smarts\\"?  They are what all people who don't have \\"book smarts\\" automatically assume they have.  Just because a book is lacking in plot development or interest, that doesn't automatically make it a \\"transition book\\".  In a transition book, you can stillpoint to character development, and situations that have transpired that will allow something big and exciting to happen in a future book.  There was very little of that in this book.  Reading a good transition book is like watching a couple of Grandmasters play a positional middle game in chess.  A lot of pieces are moved, but there are very few piece captures.  Instead, each Grandmaster is quietly setting up for the Big Moment - instead of excitement, there is tension.  In Martin's case, it's like he was trying to emulate the Grandmasters, but didn't execute correctly.  Instead, he superglued the pieces to the board, and then shook it up and down real fast.  None of them went ANYWHERE, even though they was a lot of commotion about them. <br /> <br />\\"But what about Cercei - there was a lot of development there!\\" you may say.  Well, I'm not sure how to characterize what happened to her, other than as a character she was ruined.  She had INCREDIBLE potential to be a fascinating character, but somewhere between book 3 and 4 she overdosed on stupid-pills.  I mean, this was the primary enemy of TYRION.  She fought an incredible mental/political battle with one of the finest minds in the Seven Kingdoms for 3 books.  She was a mega-player!!!  But as soon as we get into her head, she becomes one of the more phenominally inept characters in modern fantasy. <br /> <br />Many reviewers have brought up other points that I fully agree with and will not duplicate here, save one.  There was a character in the Phantom Menace called \\"Jar Jar Binks\\".  Pretty much everyone in the world (except for the very young and the very old) hated him with a passion.  Not only was he extremely annoying, he was extremely unnecessary.  Some creative folks took the brilliant initiative to edit out all of the scenes with Jar-Jar Binks from the Phantom Menace, which was subsequently passed around the internet (I'm in no way condoning that part of it).  The movie became MUCH more enjoyable this way -it was much shorter, you didn't have to suffer through Jar-Jar, and you DIDN'T MISS ANY OF THE PLOT.  The title of this version was \\"The Phantom Edit\\".   <br /> <br />Well, this character also exists in Feast For Crows.  Although Brienne isn't quite as annoying as Jar-Jar, she's even *more* unneccesary, and takes up *way* more real estate.  The book could use a good Phantom Editor.  Please, someone re-release this book with the Brienne chapters removed.  I know I can simply skip them, but it's just not the same. <br /> <br /> There is something much scarier than extraneous and/or annoying characters in this book; something that not as many people have mentioned that I find a little surprising.  The quality of the writing itself has plummeted; specifically, the writing has gotten way too descriptive, almost like Martin needed space filler (although I strongly believe this is not the case).  There are 3 main areas I break these fillers into.  1) The  \\"List\\".  If someone meets a singer, you don't need to spend  of a page on a list of 34 song titles the singer knows.  Or if there is a discussion of rumors from a far-off land (especially if we know the truth already), don't spend a whole page listing variations on the truth, and end with \\"the one thing they all had in common was --insert truth here--\\".  2) \\"The Clothes\\".  This one was WAY too Jordan-ish for me.  Every time a character meets someone else, or goes somewhere else, there is a love-fest of clothing and hair descriptions, heraldry/family trees, building descriptions, etc, etc, etc.  Some description is clearly needed to set the environment, but there is such a thing as going to far, and Martin crossed that boundary more often than not. 3) Speaking of love-fest, what's up with George \\"Skinemax\\" Martin?  I'm certainly not a prude, nor did I find the sexual references in the first few books difficult to read.  After all, there was usually some purpose/relevance.  But in this book, most of the time there is no purpose for the sex.  And it happens in almost every chapter (except the Brienne chapters of course, although there are refereces aplenty!)  <br /> <br />In any case, there was some serious editing needing to be done.  I sincerely hope this was a blip on the radar, and that Dance with Dragons will bring us right back up to speed. <br />
0671027387|2.0|This book didn't have me \\"so hooked I couldn't put it down\\" was more of - a couple of chapters before lights out.<br /><br />Main Characters reminded me of Sunset Beach (the soap opera).<br /><br />Gabriel Ashe & Rachel Sexton should have had a fight over a man or two, shame the only contender was Michael Tolland who seemed like a bit of a wimp (or wet fish)He could have done with a sinister side to make him more interesting.<br /><br />I liked the escape from the bad guys across the ice & the way emergency code was picked up by the sub. The megaplume & description of all the rock minerals got a bit boring.<br /><br />One star for the snowy location/Nasa theme.<br /><br />And One for making me smile/interested enough to buy another book - as it was light hearted action/adventure that didn't keep me awake.
B00008VGL6|4.0|This beautiful little covers album is not, of course, a Depeche Mode album. It doesn't have the production investment behind it or a point to prove. But it is a wonderful discovery of torch songs, beautifully sung with minimal instrumentation and basic but very satisfying production. Many of the songs are far from immediate but the album has grown steadily on me for the past two years and is now becoming a favourite. The choice of songs is unusual and brave- not many would take on an Alvin Stardust cover- but Martin Gore brings a uniquely beautiful darkness to each song. He understands perfectly the crossover between glam rock and the darker side of Bowie albums such as Low. What we get is a dark modern electronic take on that.  <br /> <br />The strongest track is probably his cover of Julie Cruise's In My Other World which is very atmospheric and has a haunting guitar riff. But his versions of Nick Cave's Loverman and Iggy Pop's Tiny Girls are joys to behold. The album ends with a narcotic rendition of The Velvet Underground's Candy Says which envelopes the listener. I would recommend the album to anyone who likes Martin Gore's songs on the Depeche Mode albums and is used to appreciating independent music. This is free from the shackles of major label input and you'll never hear a collection of songs like it- unless, of course, Martin Gore releases another one. Given the 14 year interlude between Counterfeit and Counterfeit2 it's unlikely but I, for one, hope he will. <br /> <br /> <br />

B000BB1MI2|2.0|I have enjoyed most, if not all, of Johnny Depp's work in the past. Not this time. His interpretation of Willy Wonka is horrible. Depp's Wonka is annoying, whiney and just plain unlikable - Depp seemed to be going for that tired Jim Carrey goofball routine here - if I wanted to watch Jim Carrey do Willy Wonka I... wouldn't.  <br /> <br />Beyond Depp's lousy Wonka the movie does have some redeeming qualities - Charlie is a very likable character and sticks pretty close to the original. Violet and Augustus are also pretty good - although the latter's gluttony was pushed just a tad too much. The other children were quite forgettable. Some of the factory/oompa loompa scenes were quite good (the boat scene), while others were poor (finding the oompa loompas... why?).  <br /> <br />Overall, a movie I was very interested to see is one I will never watch again. 2 stars is probably generous.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I love this album! It has great sounds and is beautifully written.  Most people may not like I Love New York, but it is Madonna paying homage to the place that made her a star. Jump  right now is my favorite, but the more I listen the more I love all of them. You won't be wasting your money here.  Buy it and dance :)
0793563836|5.0|I bought this book with the CDs because it came highly recommended.   I didn't know how to read regular music notation but knew I needed to learn - TAB can only get you so far.  <br /> <br />This book breaks down the notation a little at a time while providing great little tunes from the CD to play with. Each tune is a full band track - very cool! <br /> <br />I tend to be a little impatient and skipped ahead to some more tunes on the CD. I couldn't figure out why I sounded off. I then went back to read all of the notes in the book to that point. I soon found what the natural sign does - it cancels the sharps and flats in a measure. It's the little details like this that make the book VERY useful - Ed Friedland doesn't assume you know everything(which is good). <br /> <br />The main reason I bought this book was because I couldn't keep going to a bass teacher at the moment, for financial reasons. This book is great when you are on your own. But, when I can resume lessons, I will surely ask about using this book in our lessons.
B000AARKOO|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time at a friend's house on DVD.  I was amazed - even if you have a hard time with names and politics (as I often do) you'll still enjoy this movie.  It's not dripping in false faith, or being drowned by more holiness than a fanatic could stand.  It's a very surprisingly well-done movie. <br />And a strong cast keeps it going even better.  You come to enjoy characters quickly, and unfortunately in many cases watch them fall.  The battles are very Gladiator-esque (for obvious reasons) but they take nothing away, merely enhancing the choas of all out war.   <br />All in all I've not seen a better swords and war movie in a long time, but if your skeptical you can always rent it first.

B000BKDOCA|5.0|I personally think this album is great. When I first heard about Britney releasing a Remix album instead of a new studio album, I was affraid she was going to make her new 3 album contract full and I was very dissapointed.<br /><br />And then the new song leaked. 'And Then We Kiss' caught my heart. I fell in love with this song already on the first listen. I mean I wasn't expecting the new song to be this good. At the time Madonnas 'Hung Up' was my favourite but as soon as 'And Then We Kiss' leaked, I couldn't stop listening to it and 'Hung Up' fell from my top 1.<br /><br />And then the CD was released. I went out and got my copy and I gotta tell ya: I was in shock. I didn't expect anything good like this. I've always disliked remixes, even from my princess Britney but this album totally blew my mind. It's such a great album. I get completely new vibes off the songs.<br /><br />'Early Mornin', the 2 year old track that was included on her 4th studio album 'In The Zone' was boring to me at first and it was my least favourite track on the CD. But as soon as I heard the remix, I totally love it. It's so much better than the original. This remix is awsome.<br /><br />Then there came 'I'm A Slave 4 U' remix, another one that I love from B In The Mix. This remix really gets me up dancing. The sounds totally fits the vocal and the song and it feels like a totally new song. If you're having a party or something, you're making a big mistake not playing this mix.<br /><br />The remix of the 2005 track 'Someday (I Will Understand)' is absolutely amazing. The sound fits the vocal really well and the dancy beat really gets you in the good mood. I've always loved Hi-Bias mixes and this one is a great remix from them.<br /><br />'B In The Mix: The Remixes' is absolutely awsome album and every fan of Britney Spears and dance music should definately get it. The cold, dark winter brings you down but this album makes it hot!

Here is a young man who's love for entertaining gives him an added dimension unheard of in today's music world. <br /> <br />Chris Botti's duet with Mr. Buble is showstopping and his duet with the beautiful and talented Italian songstress Pausini a high light.  <br /> <br />For once a live cd/dvd's production actually allows us to feel like he's entertaining us in our living rooms. <br /> <br />Fantabulous and I would recommend it to all.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|System of a Down has finally released part 2 of the 2 album set, so how does it stack up against their previous work? In short it was much more than I expected. After listening to the entire album, I believe Hypnotize retains the heaviness from SOAD's earlier albums but goes to places they have never been before. Mezmerize, I thought, was an excellent album that was unique because the band was expanding its musical boundaries. Hypnotize continues this expansion but in my opinion it is a lot better than Mezmerize. I believe this album will be the favorite of the 2 sets among the true System fans, but that is my opinion. So what is so awesome about this album? <br />1.Attack- starts the album off with a bang, thanks to frantic vocals from Serj and alternating vocals from Daron. <br />2.Dreaming- a bit less frantic than Attack, but it sounds like something from Steal This Album. very nice. <br />3.Kill Rock n Roll- this song amazed me when I heard it at the concert in Atlanta. The studio version is even better. One of my favorite tracks right now. <br />4.Hypnotize- we all have heard this by now. It is definitely a surprise because it is a different direction for SOAD. I love it though because it has a punk feel to it towards the end. <br />5.Stealing Society- Daron and Serj alternate vocals on this one and it is crazy! Might be my favorite overall at the moment. <br />6.Tentative- slower than the previous tracks, but still a powerful song. <br />7.U-Fig- excellent guitar work on this track. <br />8.Holy Mountains- this track was floating around the net and sounded awesome. the studio version does it justice as it sounds excellent. slower type of song but very strong, I am impressed. <br />9.Vicinity of Obsenity- this is the craziest song on the album. chorus repeats \\"banana banana banana, terra cotta pie\\". It is hard to find the meaning of this track but Serj is all over the place in this one ripping it to shreds.  <br />10.She's Like Heroin- Daron stars in this track. this is a terrific song, one of their best I think.  <br />11.Lonely Day- my least favorite of the 12 tracks. Dont get me wrong, it is a good song but it is so plain that a lot of people may not like it. Probably the slowest song from any System album. <br />12.Soldier Side- WOW! this track is unbelievable. It picks up where Soldier Side Intro left off on Mezmerize, and I think these are the most personal and emotionally strong lyrics System has written. It ends the album on a very high note, leaving you Mezmerized and Hypnotized over what you just heard. <br /> <br />I hope this persuades some new listeners to check this band out. The true fans don't need any persuasion. I have been a huge fan since the self-titled album and I am completely amazed by Hypnotize. If you thought Mezmerize brought them to new heights, you haven't heard anything yet.
B000002H97|5.0|The best hard rock CD of all time
0553801503|4.0|I agree with both sides of reviewers on this issue.  Yes-we have been spoiled by the writing of George's first three books. <br />Yes-in large part there are too many character perspectives and Yes-for a while it does not move the pace along. However the last two hundred pages left us with cliffhangers involving all the main characters, Arya, Sansa, Cersei, Jaime and Brienne. While I admit I am disappointed that I will not get the answers to these characters' problems until Book Six, I knew this was going to be the case, because I have been paying attention and was aware he had split the character perspectives into two books.   <br />Please do not discount what a talented author he is.  The comments out of Jaime's mouth outside the walls of Riverrun was worth the price of the book alone. <br />When is Feast of Dragons coming out?
B00007GZR5|1.0|My British Literature teacher assigned this movie because it deals with theology and we read poets who express their theology in their poetry. I can honestly say I will never watch this movie again, unless forced to. (And yes, I even told that to my professor!) This movie was such a disappointment after about the first 45 minutes or so, especially when it got to the hell part. I even had to quit watching at that particular part because of boredom. I was also disappointed because of Robin Williams' character giving up HEAVEN to be with his SUICIDAL wife. Now how lame is that??? Yes, the scenery was nice to watch, but the plot was, and I am being nice, HORRIBLE. If you want to watch a movie, I recommend NOT watching this, unless you want to watch a horrible movie. Sorry Robin Williams, you had better luck with Mrs. Doubtfire.
B0002TX4QQ|5.0|First of, let me say that I have absolutely no connection to the author.  I stumbled upon this book by a review in THE ECONOMIST and thought it sounded interesting.   <br /> <br />I was stunned within the first few pages. <br />WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN opens brilliantly and just keeps going, like an arrow hitting its target dead center.  I had to read this in spurts because it was incredibly painful but when I read, I spent hours reading.  And I found myself re-reading passages to make sure I caught everything. I found myself marvelling as I read -- the language was beautiful, each word precise and perfectly chosen, every sentence loaded with meaning. <br /> <br />Shriver has delivered what I think is a novel as perfect as any in classic literature.  This, for me, is on the level of HUCKLEBERRY FINN, JANE EYRE, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and the best comparison: FRANKENSTEIN.  Those are well-structured, beautifully written and narrated in a PITCH PERFECT voice.   <br /> <br />I have sold at least three copies of the book already...I hope this review sells more.  This is something you want to own and re-read, if only to learn how to write.
0671027344|4.0|This is a great book about kid named Charlie. He is going into high school. Being scared, he decides he needs to talk to someone, other than a psychiatrist. The book is composed of all of Charlie's letters to someone who he heard \\"listens and understands and doesn't try to sleep with you at a party\\". In this nameless person, Charlie confides all of his hopes, dreams, memories, and worries. His brother has left for college, his best friend Michael died, and all he really wants is some friends. Thankfully, he ends up with the best friends in the whole school: Sam, Patrick, Alice, and Mary Elizabeth. Charlie chronicles his life as a freshman by dates, football games, parties, and the special books given to him by his English teacher. He goes through a lot of tough times, trying to \\"participate\\" and not just listen in the corner of the room. When these struggles seem to become too much, he turns to drugs.  <br /> I really liked that the main character was about my age. I could relate to the book a lot. All Charlie's friends were really into having debates, reading poetry, and listening to punk music. These things, I think, sound like fun. Charlie is not an \\"average\\" teenager, which made me appreciate this book a lot. What he wanted were friends, not a girlfriend or boyfriend. He is totally different than most students, but some people were able to look past that to be his friend. The only thing I didn't like about this book was all the curse words. It would have been just as good without them I think. One other thing I didn't like was that in the story, a girl got an abortion. Charlie helped the girl. That was the one part in the book that I thought Charlie was doing the wrong thing. <br /> I think just about any high school kid would like this book because they can relate to what Charlie is going through. The Perks of Being A Wallflower   is slightly similar to the book I Am The Wallpaper . Both these books are like diaries. The main character in each book is in high school, and they're quiet people. I recommend both books to any teen.  <br />
B000BM6AVA|2.0|I got this album last week, and was sorely dissapointed. I'm a System of a Down fan, and had been looking forward to this after the briliance of Mezmerize. But, I find it impossible to get in to. The only stand out tracks are Hypnotize and Soldier side which continues from the Soldier side intro on Mezmerize.

He only six years old when he goes to outer space and does the best he can to get through the training and becomes a commander but you have to read the book to see if he does or if he does not.They play the games that they are given to see who is the best of them all. <br /> <br />I liked most of the book just the parts where it got boring and did not have enough action in it or I just did not like it some parts of the book because they could have done better.But over all I thought that the book was pretty good, but the bigest thing there was is the bad word they put in this book. <br /> <br />If you like books that are action,mistery,and if you like outer space this is a book for you and if you like books that are romantic do not read this book.If you like books when the use  really bad words. <br />
B000BM6AVA|5.0|ok, im not the biggest SOAD fan in the world, i own Toxicity, which is a great album but i never got or even heard Steal This Album and the self titled album is good. So when i started hearing that they were making a double cd i just thought that maybe id check it out, then i started hearing songs off Mezmerize and thought it might be a good album, so i got it. It was an amazing album, every song kicks ass and i listen to it all the time. So i was really excited when the second part of this great album was coming out.  <br /> <br />Anyway, i got it today and haven't stopped listening to it. I'm not gonna sit here and go into every friggin' song but i will say that they are really well written, performed and produced. So far i think Mezmerize is alittle better but i say that because i have been listening to that album so much since getting it six months ago. <br /> <br />People complain that Darons singing pisses them off and complain that he should stick to the guitar playing and leave the singing to Serj but i disagree, i personally like when Daron sings, he doesn't have the greatest voice in the world but its a strong voice and i really like when they switch off. <br /> <br />so go get this album and listen to it, you wont regret it.
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|I happed across 30 Seconds to Mars after hearing \\"Echelon\\" during the rolling credits of the cinematic travesty called \\"The Core\\" (the best part of the movie, IMHO).  I was so intrigued with the sound and the band, I immediately ordered both the self-titled c.d. and \\"A Beautiful Lie.\\"  What can I say?  I'm honestly impressed.  The sound is clean, the vocals painfully beautiful, the songwriting flawless, and the lyrics meaningful.  What is most intriguing about 30 Seconds is that it is headed by Jared Leto, the same actor who portrayed wanna-be rock star and garage band front man Jordan Catalano in the series \\"My So-Called Life.\\"  Who'd have thunk it?  Now, it is admittedly difficult for someone who associates Leto with this series alone to listen to ABL and not think, \\"Wow, it's Jordan Catalano! He finally made it big!\\"  Muddling past this associative effort is the only reason I gave this c.d. four stars instead of five.  Certainly nothing about Leto's singing/songwriting is disengenuous; but I can't help but to think that 30 Seconds to Mars has not achieved the recognition it deserves as a Serious Band because of Leto's Hollyweird connection.  There's just something offputting about reading about the lead singer \\"canoodling\\" with the likes of Lindsay Lohan or Mary Kate Olson or whatever flavor-of-the-month ex-Mouseketeer happens to be in circulation in People magazine.  A band is more than the sum of its talent.  Public image is also a critical factor, and Leto's vast multi-media exposure doesn't lend the band much credibility.  A shame, because 30 Seconds to Mars deserves much more than that.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|Yes, \\"Born To Run\\" is great music, and the CD remastering job is pretty good. But the Hammersmith Odeon concert DVD is the gem in this package. The video is marginal, but don't worry about it. The sound quality of the concert is outstanding for a 1975 recording. It's got a few rough spots of feedback and Max's cymbals sound a little smeared, although overall, it sounds better than the murky mix of the 2000 recording for the \\"Live In New York City\\" CD set. And the Hammersmith performance is to die for. The jazzy, jam band version of \\"Kitty's Back\\" alone is worth the price of admission, and the totally reworked \\"E Street Shuffle\\" is an unexpected treat. If you're a Springsteen fan, you cannot go wrong with this set.<br /><br />By the way, the Born To Run CD is not copy protected with Sony's notoriously awful Digital Rights Management junk, and I had no problem ripping it to MP3 files.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Watching this DVD set, it makes me regret missing the original series and supporting it while it was on.  The movie  is fantastic, but we are missing so much character developement that would've been developed more if this great show was still on the air.  This DVD set is a must buy.
0783225849|4.0|Some consider Hitch a genius--I don't, never have. If you want to see genius at work take a look at anything by Akira Kurosawa. <br />Anyway, even though I feel the first third of this flick is fairly lame: the scene in the hotel room with Gavin and Leigh way too weak and poorly acted, the blabbermouth with the forty grand in cash in the realty office not only in your face obnoxious, but the setup is clumsy--although once the Janet Leigh character checks into the Bates Motel everything clicks along like a Swiss time piece: there is adequate character develoment, not to mention great cinematography ( the clunky camera pan away from the shower to the dresser not withstanding, that draws way too much attention to itself and makes you aware that you're watching a movie, not a good thing--but, as I said, last two thirds are terrific: Martin Balsam, Perkins, Vera Miles, even Gavin comes to life a bit. Simon Oakland terrific as the shrink to wrap things up. <br /> <br />Still, that spooky old house and the run-down motel could be the best thing about this entire enterprise. <br /> <br />Four stars is my rating for the video version. The DVD could rate five (due to all the behind the scenes extras.)
B000BGH22W|5.0|At first, yes, I was a bit upset that Williams wasn't going to do this movie's score, though I never really cared for his work on these movie's in the first place. The only memorable thing he did was obviously the theme, and one song from the Prisoner of Azkaban, everything else is ambience and random mystery noises. Doyle did a WONDERFUL job, forget what all these hate-mongers are saying. 'Death of Cedric' is a sorrow-full piece of work that portrays the emotion that is the scene. And the new \\"love\\" theme, if you will, for Harry is absolutely beautiful. It is played both when Harry and Cho talk, and when Harry's parents talk to him. Another huge part that struck me as amazing is the mermaid chant that is in 'Underwater Secrets' track. Exactly how I imagined it to sound. I thought it was an awesome soundtrack, and I really really hope Doyle comes back for Order of the Phoenix and Half-blood Prince. And hopefully the 7th.
0767830555|4.0|Great motion picture. No point going into the plot; you know what it's about.  <br /> <br />My only beef is with the \\"tacked-on\\" unrealistic ending. Bickle as hero? Give me a break. <br /> <br />One of the reviewers claims that this is only happening inside Bickle's mind (right after the shoot-out) ...I can't say more from fear of spoiling it for those who have yet to see this powerful flick... I will only say that I doubt Scorsese and Shrader are that clever to have thought of it. Say, for the sake of argument, that that's what they meant and intended...well, then, I'd say it's pure genius on their part. However, I doubt it. <br /> <br />I still maintain, unless Bickle is spinning this resolution inside his noggin...it does not work. But, if he is fantasizing...it is absolutely appropriate.
0060392886|4.0|Wow! I am worn out after reading this book of the Crue and their orgy, drunken, drugged out ways. What a book! As good or better than Aerosmith's Walk This Way.<br /><br />We are spared no quarter as the Crue described their fight up the musical ladder. How they drank and drugged their way to the top and lived to tell about it! You will read about most everything in this book - Nikki's anger with his mom and dad; the brother and sister he never knew he had; Vince's womanizing and drinking and fights with the band; Tommy's battle with alcohol and Heather and Pam; and lastly, Mick - as one other reviewer said - he doesn't say much and I find myself drawn to him more than the others. Quite interesting with respect to what he has to say and how he is treated by the world. Really amazing.<br /><br />After reading this book, you will wonder how in the world that they ain't dead from drugs or alcohol or why they ain't in jail for murder! Could it get any worse for these guys?<br /><br />Definitely worth the read.
B000005B0U|5.0|The Blues Brothers Show Band was assembled for comedic purposes, but they were also one of the greatest groups of blues musicians ever assembled.  Throw in legends like BB King, Wilson Pickett, Lou Rawls, Koko Taylor, Dr. John and some new kids like Johnny Lang and Erykah Badu, and you can still make a mediocre movie - I enjoyed it but I'm just being honest - but you can't make anything less than a GREAT record.  Some of the highlights include Blues Traveler's otherwise unavailable \\"Maybe I'm Wrong\\", the hilarious \\"Cheaper to Keep Her\\", and - my favorite - the huge ensemble rendition of \\"New Orleans\\".  I've discovered that this record makes for some of the best road music around and is just a great listen for anyone interested in blues soul and R & B.
B00006JU7T|4.0|I simply cannot understand why only 45 people have reviewed this movie.  SERPICO is a classic of 1970s cinema and of Lumet's film catalog.  Watching SERPICO is like taking a big breath of fresh air.  I love returning to the realism of the 1970s.  Lumet's camera always seems to cut right through all of the muck, casting a bright light on his character's lives, situations, and surroundings.  SERPICO is the true story of a virtuous cop in a corrupt system.  A veteran of the plain clothes unit, Frank Serpico (Al Pacino) lives and breathes the streets of New York.  We follow him from his graduation from the academy and observe his entire progression as a cop in the force.<br /><br />Pacino is at the top of his art form: he lives and breathes this cop.  Things start going badly for Serpico because he is the only plain clothes cop in the city who is not accepting bribes from the local gangsters and underworld.  While Serpico lives in an idealistic world in which the cops are cleaning up the streets and making New York a safer place to live, the other cops are merely using the force to make a very good living.  They give no thought or care for crime.<br /><br />As Serpico begins to seek advice and counsel on how to improve his situation, he begins to realize just how far the corruption goes.  SERPICO works because it traps our character.  He is a cop.  He has always wanted to be a cop.  He cannot just quit.  But he can't turn to anyone for help either because the whole force is corrupt.  What is ironic is that in a world of drugs, murder, and money, Serpico's greatest enemies are his fellow police officers.<br /><br />SERPICO is not a terribly uplifting film.  It is inspiring to watch a man whose character is so unquestionable that you feel bad for your own inadequacies and failings.  But it is also hard to see a good man suffer at the hands of a corrupt system.  Please: see this movie and give it the reviews that it deserves.  Love it or hate it, SERPICO is a classic of modern cinema that will hopefully receive a rich DVD transfer someday.assic of modern cinema that will hopefully receive a rich DVD transfer someday.
B000BHN7D4|5.0|this would be a good time for america to wake up and embrace this tremendously talented singer. how this woman is not as successful in the usa as she is in europe is beyond me. so many great songs here. from the dance/pop/r+b of her first two albums, to the rock influenced hits from her third album. this is a great way to catch up if you've missed out on anastacia. <br />also includes \\"everything burns\\" with ben moody from evanesence and her gorgeous duet with italian superstar eros romazotti, \\"i belong to you\\"
B00005JNZP|5.0|The frame of the moon, half shrouded in clouds,  resonates with us. As the human-canine quartet amble through the Ukraine, they travel not only through space, but through time. The tour guide Grandfather gets \\"lost,\\" but somehow manages to pop up outside of Jonathan's destination.  He softens as he guides Jonathan, and we sense the trip also has meaning for him as well.<br /><br />The film is rich in imagery from the symbolism of sight, glasses,  and the seemingly farcical loss of vision. Then there are endless roads and change of scenery as we near the climax . . . especially at night where the spirits live on. Even, Jonathan's collecting takes on added symbolic significance as the movie progresses.<br /><br />Giving away as little as possible, the film is the grandfather's journey. A Journey he is bound to complete, even as he hesitates at the `call to adventure.' His character grows, becomes more complex and withdrawn as he nears the climax. In retrospect, one could argue that he purposely delayed the journey to ready himself . . . to steady himself from the ghosts of the past, burning in his memory.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this is a transcendent film. Like Star Wars or The Shawshank Redemption, its images linger on the palate like your mother's homemade ice cream on a summer day long gone.
B00009UW0N|5.0|As tempting as it is to write the umpteenth dissertation on the importance and brilliance of John Carpenter's Halloween, it's almost enough to say that there is very possibly no other seminal seventies film--not The Godfather, not Star Wars, perhaps not even Jaws--that has had a greater influence on popular culture. It is a movie about a fishbowl that exists now only in a fishbowl, a picture so examined that its sadistic ability to maintain an atmosphere of horrified anticipation is consumed by the intellectualization of its hedonism=death equation. A screening with fresh eyes reveals a picture and a filmmaker owing incalculable debts to Alfred Hitchcock and Howard Hawks.<br /><br />Having already aped Hawks' Rio Bravo with the in-ascendance Assault on Precinct 13, Carpenter makes reference to the great director in Halloween's spacious tableaux and canny utilization of depth of field, as well as directly in an oft-glimpsed late show revival of The Thing from Another World, a film he would, of course, remake four years later. Hitchock-ily speaking, the picture's prologue murder, borrowing the killer child's POV shots from Bob Clark's under-credited Black Christmas, owes to Psycho the fast-edited shower attack, while the character of vein-popping psychiatrist Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) owes that film's beefcake lover his name. Scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis is, of course, Janet Leigh's daughter, and her character, naïve babysitter Laurie Strode, answers a phone in her employer's house the same way as a housekeeper in Rear Window. Film buffery aside (and Carpenter is unofficially among the first wave of film brat filmmakers in the United States), Halloween works because it understands Hitchcock's idea of suspense: the first two-thirds of the picture essentially character development and set-up, and the last third a continuous pay-off.<br /><br />Laurie isn't so much the prototypical virgin of psychosexual slasher operas to follow as she is just generally ignorant about the harshness of life. In a way, Halloween can be read with most profit as a coming-of-age fantasy--a Little Red Riding Hood fable, a story of course with decidedly overt sexual elements, where the Big Bad Wolf is an indestructible archetype of entropy rather than just a statement of the bestial nature of sexuality. Notice that in Halloween, the victims of the boogeyman are the ones who stray, literally, from the safety of the \\"path\\" as Laurie strides, again literally, the straight and narrow. The moment that Laurie crosses the street, in effect bisecting the safe passage, is also the moment she becomes viable prey.<br /><br />The power of Halloween, aside from Carpenter's brilliant use of Panaglide tracks and push-ins and gift for packing the fore- and backgrounds with information, lies in the clarity with which these occasionally wayward teens care for children and one another. With the element of empathy the very thing that distinguishes the best of Carpenter (The Fog, The Thing) from the worst (Vampires, Ghosts of Mars), Halloween is at some level about sacrifice and love. Even histrionic-prone shrink Loomis is something of a disillusioned father figure, the delight he exhibits in scaring a few kids away from the killer's home a complicated gesture that speaks at once of paternal concern and prurient delight. At its heart, the same warring instincts define the film proper, which, for all of the babysitting lives claimed by the mad-dog killer, dedicatedly spares the lives of its youngest charges, often as a direct result of the selfless actions of the teen protagonists. Halloween cares about the cult of childhood, and that, above possibly anything else, is reason enough that the picture is an enduring modern masterpiece.<br /><br />Anchor Bay, an outfit I praise effusively and without reservation for their dedication to the preservation and restoration of important genre films, has dropped the ball with their 25th Anniversary Divimax edition of Halloween. Cinematographer Dean Cundey's colour filters have been messed with, rendering the picture ridiculously bright at the expense of any real believability that it takes place near the time of the titular season. The frustration of the video presentation is that it's married to the long-coveted Criterion LaserDisc commentary track featuring producer Debra Hill, Carpenter, and Curtis; in a perfect world, this yakker would come with the format's previous, Cundey-approved transfer of Halloween. The world is, alas, a flyblown mistress and the best extras for this seminal offering come with a video transfer that's far from the worst, and also sadly far from faithful. All things being equal, though, it's far better to see this picture in its 2.35:1 glory with 16x9 enhancement (see also: MGM's Special Edition of The Fog, Cundey's amazing work rendered with more faithfulness therein). There's more information at the peripherals and foreground in Carpenter/Cundey's worst than in the best of most--thank Hawks' influence for that, despite Hawks' own aversion to widescreen. Here's a movie not conducive to panning-and-scanning.<br /><br />The Dolby Digital 5.1 remix doesn't sound any different from the last couple of iterations to these weary ears. Dialogue is crisp and Carpenter's excellent score is rendered with fidelity from every channel. Most impressive is the use of surround and rear channel effects--dare you not to jump at least once to a cunning atmospheric creeping up from behind. The abovementioned feature-length yakker is informative and good natured, with Hill providing the bulk of the \\"meat\\" and Carpenter the fluffier potatoes--which is not to say that he doesn't impart neat information (\\"This is where PJ Soles trips on the dolly track...right...there\\"), just that he seems more convivial than Hill. Hill also irritates with her early assertion, never corrected, that Michael Myers' soon-to-be dead sister is the only girl topless in the flick--I'm no expert, having only seen the film a few dozen times, but I could swear that Soles displays her wares, and conspicuously, to boot.<br /><br />A second platter reveals an 87-minute documentary, Halloween: A Cut Above the Rest, that will be mostly second nature for a fanboy, but is arranged and presented in such a way as to make it indispensable for the neophyte while still serving as a nice reference for the scholar. It's probably unavoidable, for the breadth of both, that a lot of the information is duplicated in the commentary. (The treasure of the piece for me, as you might imagine by now, are the bits with Cundey.) A 10-minute \\"On Location, 25 Years Later\\" is a factory-fresh featurette featuring \\"then and now\\" shots of the picture's locations with commentary by Hill and Soles (all of it superfluous if you ask me); a shoddy-looking 1.85:1 theatrical trailer; two 1.33:1 television spots; two brief radio spots; a DVD-ROM interface through which you can access the script and screen savers; and an exhaustive promotional art/stills gallery make up the requisite portion of the extras.en.

A 10-minute \\"On Location, 25 Years Later\\" is a factory-fresh featurette featuring \\"then and now\\" shots of the picture's locations with commentary by Hill and Soles (all of it superfluous if you ask me); a shoddy-looking 1.85:1 theatrical trailer; two 1.33:1 television spots; two brief radio spots; a DVD-ROM interface through which you can access the script and screen savers; and an exhaustive promotional art/stills gallery make up the requisite portion of the extras. <br /> <br />
0895260131|3.0|There's an apocryphal tale about a meeting between George Bush Sr. and Mikhail Gorbachev shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall signalled the collapse of European Communism. \\"I'm very sorry for the great wrong I have done to you,\\" said the architect of glasnost. Bush asked what he meant. \\"I've deprived you of an enemy,\\" explained Gorby. <br /> <br />It wasn't until Bush's least favoured son stumbled, blinking and stammering into the White House (with a corridor pass from Condi so that he could go to the bathroom all by himself) that the US finally got a new real enemy (Saddam and Slobo were really just stopgaps). Fundamentalist Islamic jihad hits all the boogieman buttons that Communism found, with the delicious extra that its practitioners aren't atheists, and thus can be tempted into self-immolation with the promise of celestial paradise. <br /> <br />Robert Spencer offers a meticulously researched account (well, the guy seems to have read the Qu'ran, which is more than most swivel-eyed neocons have done) of the seamier side of Islam, with particular concentration on the Crusades. He believes the medieval campaigns against the infidels have been sullied by lefty revisionists, and the chainmailed hordes were in fact the good guys. <br /> <br />However, the book operates under false pretences. It's all working towards a conclusion that implores \\"The West\\" (whatever that is) to reclaim its sense of pride and self-worth. Effectively, this is not a book about Islam - it's yet another screed of preaching to the scared, insular denizens of Jesusland, in the fine tradition of the John Birch Society and all those wackos who gave us such a laugh in the good old days of the Cold War. None Dare Call It Jihad, or something like that. <br /> <br />\\"Listen up, America,\\" says Mr Spencer, \\"Islam is bad,mmmkay. Now let's talk about us...\\"
0780624890|5.0|People that thought \\"The Matrix\\" as a new milestone in action film making have clearly missed out on \\"Blade\\". The opening of the film in a nightclub is a bravura moment of horror meeting action like never before. What elevates the film into a class of its own, is that it goes on to top that opener with successively greater displays of action choreography melding with special effects.<br /><br />\\"Blade\\" could have been yet another overblown blockbuster, but it differs in that its relentless nature builds excitement rather than smacking of desperate CGI-laced attempts to keep the audience interested.<br /><br />Wesley Snipes is Blade, a superhero whose fight against vampires has been born out of a dark and sad past. He's up against Frost, a brash young vampire with ambitions that go against the wishes of more senior bloodsuckers, who have secretly prolonged the existence of their sharp-toothed kind for many years.<br /><br />Snipes plays his superhero character with such aching coolness that you can't wait for the next dumb-ass vampire to get in his way. Such challenges are met with flurries of lethal kung fu and deadpan quips that are actually funny. These retorts reflect an underlying healthy sarcasm in the script, which is in turn beautifully exploited by Blade's mentor, Kris Kristofferson as Whistler.<br /><br />The sardonic nature of the movie is further enhanced by the ability of the characters to poke fun at the ludicrous nature of the hyper-intense fights that propel Blade in his quest to rid the world of vampires. It's a journey that's enjoyably involving, despite the frenetic pace, and that's a rarity with any action blockbuster.
B000B8QEYC|2.0|I like one song on this cd. \\"It's in the Rain\\" is a beautiful song. The rest sound like they were rushed to be completed in order to meet the release date. <br /> <br />I have all of her other cds and I usually enjoy them, but this is the first one that I only like one song. Creatively, this one is missing something. She also looks silly on the cover. <br /> <br />So far in 2005, the only artist to release a completely amazing cd is Madonna with \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor.\\" Maybe Enya could call Madonna's producer. She needs a new sound. It's time to reinvent yourself, Enya!
2070364232|5.0|A collection of stories told from the perspective of a young French boy, Le Petit Nicolas is charming and extremely hilarious!  I have not read this book in many years, but I never forgot the stories and cartoon drawings that cracked me up so much.  The chapter where he smokes cigars, entitled \\"Je Fume,\\" comes to mind as one of my favorites. Also, for me it was not just the stories themselves, but the way he tells them that make it so funny.  I'd had a couple of years of French in high school and in college before I read this, and while that was more than enough background to enjoy it immensely, there were parts that were difficult to understand.  Many phrases, like \\"un coup de poing sur le nez,\\" are easy enough to figure out, and usually the context is enough to clarify things if one gets stumped.  In many ways Nicolas reminds me of Calvin, from Calvin and Hobbes.  There are not as many pictures (although the ones included are excellent), and while Nicolas has a cleaner haircut, he is no less the rebel for it.  This is highly recommended reading for anyone with any ability whatsoever in the French language.
B0007Y4USW|1.0|I tried to give my cat a bath one time. The screeching sound it made is what this cd sounds like. It's like that sound you get when you scratch a chalkboard! It's really that BAD! There is one song on this cd that is good and that is the single \\"We Belong Together.\\" Other than that one, this cd is horrible! Even that one isn't good now because they played it too much on the radio and now I change the station as soon as I hear her howling. Also what's with all the lame guest rappers? I can remember when Mariah sang \\"Vision of Love\\" and her voice was so great. I used to be a big fan, but this sounds like she's been smoking and ruined her voice. Those rappers ruin any song for me. I hate this! <br /> <br />I would suggest Madonna's cd \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" instead. That album is good all the way through. It also contains not one single guest rapper!

B000BB1MHS|5.0|Tim Burton's \\"Charlie & the Chocolate Factory\\" is a remake as well as an adaptation of both the Roald Dahl novel and screenplay as well as a visual wonder of a film. Comparing it to \\"Willy Wonka & the Charlie Factory\\" it is a lot more faithful to the book and is a lot better visually. All the actors play their parts well; the visual effects, makeup, and set direction are worthy of Oscar nods. Johnny Depp's portrayal of the androgynous candy maker is spectacular. People compare his performance to Michael Jackson, and there's obviously some Jacko in there, but he also reminded me of an equally controversial singer (Marilyn Manson). The look Depp has in the film brought to mind both Manson and Jackson, the voice Jackson. Whatever it is, Depp is great. The script, adapted by John August, has a lot more depth; Even diving into Wonka's childhood. Burton is still himself, the film has the Burton mood and music (composed by Danny Elfman). Anyway, the film is about Charlie (Freddie Highmore, Finding Neverland) who lives with his father (Noah Taylor), his mother (Helena Bonham Carter) and his bedridden grandparents in their lopsided house. Everyday, Charlie passes Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. A factory which has been open for a while, but seems to never have anybody going in or out. But then suddenly it is announced that Willy Wonka has hidden five golden tickets in candy bars that are to be shipped around the world. Anyway, same ol' story; Charlie finds the golden ticket and along with four other children go into Wonka's famous factory. Now for the children and their parents. Well, there are some changes. The parents of the children are quite different. The kids are pretty much the same; Augustus Gloop is a fat disgusting child. Veruca Salt is a spoiled brat. Violet Beauregard is a competitive gum chewing over-achieving little girl. And then Mike Teevee is still the kid who sits in front of the TV all day, except this time he plays video games. The Oompa-Loompa's have changed quite a bit as well. Instead of the green haired, orange faced midgets we're used too. We have a single actor (Deep Roy) playing the Oompa-Loompa's who now merely wear orange jumpsuits. Very well done. A-.
B000AY3KN0|5.0|I remember the first time I saw \\"King Kong\\" on television as a child.  Although I was quite young, the cinematography still made a huge impression on me.  While I had no idea who Fay Wray was at the age of 5, I knew I loved the movie, and the fantastic story of a giant ape found on Skull Island and captured as the \\"8th Wonder of the World!\\"    Now, as Peter Jackson creates yet another version of the Kong story, I can't help but come back to the original.  As some reviewers have mentioned, the spider scene is indeed back in the new DVD set.  Amazingly, the actual film holds up well 70 years later.  The Willis O'Brien special effects were revolutionary at the time, and stop-motion animation allowed Merian Cooper to bring a 50-foot gorilla to life on the silver screen. The legendary Harryhausen was inspired by this film, as was the current remake's director, Peter Jackson.      Although I'm sure Jackson's version will be phenomenal (hopefully better than the Jessica Lange 1976 production), I still love the original.  The movie not only inspired remakes, but also \\"Son of Kong,\\" the Godzilla films, and science fiction cinema as a whole.      Like \\"Citizen Kane,\\" \\"The Godfather,\\" or any number of other classic films, get this one.  \\"King Kong\\" is the type of movie that needs to be preserved for generations to come.      Why settle for a modern interpretation when there's no need to improve on the original?  ~LBS
B0000AMRJC|4.0|*I recently saw Scarface when it was released into theatres to coincide with it's debut on Blu-Ray. If I am correct and this theatrical release is indicative of the Blu-Ray release, I can tell you that the film has never looked more stunning. The picture is crisp, clean, and really shows how beautifully shot the film is, as well as the unique use of color throughout.    Scarface needs no introduction. Loosely inspired by a 1932 gangster-picture based on Al Capone, Scarface is a bonafide gangster-movie classic that has overshadowed its 1932 counterpart to the point of obscurity. A teacher I had in high school was once (poorly and inaccurately) discussing movies and asked the class \\"Scarface is based on a true story, right? Who is it based on?\\" A kid in the back of the class called out \\"Al Capone.\\" The teacher laughed and in a mocking tone replied \\"It's not based on Al Capone!\\" There you have it; for many people, this is not only the definitive version of Scarface, but the only one that exists. The film developed a cult following after its 1983 theatrical release, but has outgrown that cult following and developed something much more substantial. As of 2011, the film has been widely embraced by mainstream audiences, film critics, filmmakers, and Hip-Hop musicians. It's been endlessly satirized, parodied, and referenced in popular culture and is considered a classic \\"gangster\\" picture, frequently mentioned alongside [[ASIN:B0019L770A The Godfather]] and [[ASIN:0790729725 GoodFellas]]. It also has one of the most legendary screen performances of all time with Al Pacino's performance as Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee, who arrives in Miami, Florida with nothing but his balls and his word...and an insatiable thirst for power.     Directed by Brian De Palma at the peak of his creativity and written by Oliver Stone, Scarface appeals to a wide range of demographics due to the collaborative creative genius of these two. De Palma had made a name for himself directing thrillers with strong artistic sensibilities, while Stone had yet to establish himself as he would later and his recent writing projects had been the acclaimed Midnight Express and, oddly enough, Conan the Barbarian. De Palma had a style that appealed greatly to film aficionados, but he also possessed a capacity for making films that were accessible and straight-forward enough for the mainstream, while Stone had dabbled in action films but possessed the intelligence, capability, and talent to do something more than his résumé suggested. Scarface is a film that has been subjected to long-winded analysis by esteemed film critics and has simply been labeled \\"badass\\" by the typical moviegoer. On the surface, it's just a gangster movie with plenty of cocaine, violence, and language but Stone managed to incorporate more complicated themes of lust, power, and determination into his straight-forward narrative. This film and the Tony Montana character represent something to people. His principles and extravagant lifestyle have made him an idol for those maintaining a \\"gangster\\" persona, but there's something deeper too. Perhaps it's because Tony essentially lives the drug-addled American Dream that people latch onto him so fiercely.     Most people seem to agree that Scarface is a masterpiece, but I've always found it a tad overrated. In recent years, the term `overrated' has grown to mean \\"something that's supposed to be great, but is actually terrible.\\" When I say Scarface is overrated, I mean that it's supposed to be great, but I've found that it just lingers on that line between `great' and `very good.' There are many scenes that rank as some of the best in cinematic history and so few bad scenes, but I have never latched onto the film in the way so many others have. The more I see it though, the more apparent things become. Most recently, I started to take notice of the score by Giorgio Moroder. It's synthesizer-driven, yet doesn't age the film as many musical scores from the 80s have. Would the opening credits of the film be so effectively ominous with any other music? Much of the music is as iconic as the film and suits the tone and setting perfectly.    Many aspects of Scarface lend to the case that it's one of the greatest films ever made. This is one of the most quotable movies ever made certainly and the iconic dialogue (coupled with the delivery) still holds up after becoming so imbedded into the cultural vernacular. Most films are lucky if they have half as many great/memorable scenes as this one; the opening scene, the chainsaw scene, the helicopter scene, the bathtub scene, and, of course, the incredibly executed climax. De Palma's direction is straight-forward enough for mainstream viewers, but has enough of his artistic sensibility to give film enthusiasts something to admire. Then, there's the one-of-a-kind performance by Al Pacino which, make no mistake about it, is one of the great screen performances. As Tony Montana, Pacino is frightening, hilarious, psychotic, yet human, going completely over-the-top but never losing control. Few actors could make Tony such a layered character. It's a calculated performance that is utterly flamboyant and endlessly fascinating. The iconic status of Scarface is indebted to Pacino, who took a great risk playing this character this way and miraculously, flawlessly pulled it off. He's overacting certainly, but how else could this character exist? Even going over-the-top, Tony never seems disconnected from the world around him. Stone's dialogue is great on its own, but Pacino's declaration \\"All I have in this world is my balls and my word and I don't break them for no one\\" is the landmark dialogue it is because of the way it's delivered rather than written. \\"I kill a communist for fun, but for a green card, I gonna carve him up real nice.\\" Calculated; even with the flamboyant accent, Pacino emphasizes every word just right for maximum effect. When Pacino is onscreen, the movie is his. It's impossible to take your eyes off of him and without him, Tony Montana would not exist in the capacity he does today. It's a performance that will still be talked about hundreds of years from now. His performance makes such a massive impression that the other acting contributions are frequently overlooked. While this is unquestionably Pacino's movie in every sense, as he overshadows everyone around him, the actors that inhabit this world do incredible work themselves, evident in how each and every character, big and small, are so memorable. There is not a weak performance to be found and if people could avert their eyes from Pacino for a moment, they'd rave about the ensemble. The cast sink into their characters so well that it's impossible to separate the character from the actor. How many times do you think people have seen Steven Bauer in later films and thought `its Manny!'    Scarface is an imperfect film, but this critique may be based on viewer subjectivity rather than cinematic imperfection. Regardless, the perfections largely outnumber the imperfections, which are few but prominent. It's a little too `80s for its own good at times, especially in the obligatory, cheesy 80s montage that singlehandedly ages the movie more than anything else. Even with a running time of 170 minutes, Oliver Stone's script is very tightly structured. Stone even suggests Shakespearean themes amongst the chaos, but some scenes seem stretched too long. Perhaps Stone felt every scene in his script was necessary to illustrate the man Tony Montana is, but it seems that it could have been trimmed and had the same impact. De Palma's direction is near-perfect until it comes to handling Tony's incestuous inclinations towards his sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio). This is an essential part of illustrating Tony Montana's psyche, but I have issues with the way De Palma handles it. It just seems so over the top and overemphasized. With the final scene between Tony and Gina, it may have beenimpossible, but I think De Palma could have made it more subtle rather than emphasizing Tony's feelings with ominous music and extreme close-ups.    No matter what the subject matter, you need to be in a certain mood and frame of mind to embark on a 3-hour movie. My level of enjoyment watching Scarface has varied with each viewing due to extraneous circumstances. I'm in the minority in that I consider it a mild masterpiece, but wouldn't rank it as one of my favorite films. On this more recent viewing, I grew bored with it at times but this could be attributed more to a lack-of-sleep and a long day than an objective view of the quality of the film. While I enjoyed it less than before, my appreciation for it deepened dramatically and I may retract my steadfast affirmation that it's not a masterpiece when I watch it again someday. I greatly admire it, but I don't greatly enjoy it. In the meantime, I acknowledge that Scarface has lost none of its power with the curse of over-familiarity. Everyone has seen this film referenced or parodied at some point, yet this has not reflected on the finished product at all. Whether people's undying love for the film stems from what it is or what it represents is irrelevant; Scarface, in many ways, is a great film that has made an impact on both cinema and culture that can't be ignored.     GRADE: B+
B000BGH22W|5.0|When I first found out that Patrick Doyle was going to compose the music for GOF, I must admit that I was kind of worried. J. Williams did an amazing job composing the music for the first 3 Harry Potter films and I didn't think that Doyle could succeed him in this incredibly demanding task. After all, he only had around 10 million HP fans to please! I saw Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire the first night it opened at midnight. The first thing I noticed was how amazing the music was! Doyle kept \\"Hedwig's Theme\\" (William's main theme for the Philosopher's Stone) and built a whole new music theme on that. Doyle's music has a more dramatic/dark flavor, which blends great with the movie. Some pieces, like Cedric's Death, are so powerful, you feel like you are about to cry! The whole album is wicked, but my personal favorites are: <br />1. The Story Continues (this is the opening theme, based on William's main theme) - 1 <br />2. the Quidditch World Cup - 3  <br />3. Foreign Visitors Arrive - 5 <br />4. Harry in Winter (this is such a lyrical piece! It's from when Harry asks Cho to the Yule Ball) - 12 <br />5. Potter Waltz (The champions dance at the Yule Ball) - 13 <br />6. Hogwarts March (3rd task) - 16 <br />7. Death of Cedric (no comment...) - 19 <br />8. Hogwarts Hymn (closing credits) - 21 <br />9. Do the Hippogriff (wizards can rock!) - 22 <br />If you are a Harry Potter fan, or you just like good music, then this album is for you! Actually, I'm listening to it right now!!!! <br />
B000AP04L0|5.0|Mike Judge, creator of the Milton comic strips and the TV series <br />King of the Hill (and Beavis & Butthead) has never been a favorite of mine. But I've heard many good things about Office Space and I see why. This was a terrific, funny, and entertaining movie. The film is very funny (a lot of it is subtle humor and it's charming). Ron Livingston plays Peter, a typical working man who works at Initech but hates his job which he views as merely sitting in a cubicle. He works along with two very funny co-workers; <br />Michael Bolton (David Herman), no relation to the pop star and Samir (Ajay Naidu). After a strange experience with a hypnotist Peter decides he's just not going to go to work and stay at home. Then he gets a sexy girlfriend Joanna (Jennifer Aniston) and gets promoted. The film also includes the character that inspired the movie Milton (Stephen Root, Dodgeball) who is a mumbling idiot who was laid off from Initech months ago but continues to recieve a paycheck due to a glitch in the system...As I said it's subtle humor. One part that I found hilarious was when Michael is sitting in his car rapping along to this hardcore gangster rap, really getting into it and when a black man walks past his car he locks the door.

0688107826|5.0|This well-bound hardcover book is a medium brown color without the dust jacket, and has gold lettering on the spine.  There's also a lightly embossed picture of the front cover on the hardcover.<br /><br />The inside pages are made of high quality paper, and there are about 11 illustrations throughout the book, including the front cover.<br /><br />The illustrations are printed in color on glossy paper, and are not the original illustrations.  They look like oil paintings, mostly of the characters in the book, and the faces have an intentionally \\"blotchy\\" but artistic look to them, in higher contrast than portraits meant to capture real life.<br /><br />The print looks to be about medium height (say, 10-12 point) printed without columns on each page.

B0006L16N8|5.0|Excellent CD.  Coldplay's music is hypnotic, sexy and beautiful.  I love all the songs, but I gotta give extra points to \\"Square One\\", \\"Speed of Sound\\", \\"A Message\\", \\"Hardest Part\\" and \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\". My favorite song: \\"Talk\\". <br />Needless to say, I've become a big fan of Coldplay, and this new recording makes me like them a lot more.  If you like Coldplay's music and style, you won't be dissapointed with X&Y.  It has a little bit of Parachutes and A rush of blood to the head.  You know it's Coldplay when you listen to it, and at the same time you realize they've grown and evolved.  I totally love this CD and really recommend it!
B00092ZL80|4.0|When these two bands get together, we really get our money's worth seeing these two legends, who has sold out concerts respectively, on the same stage. I gave it 4 stars because Chicago left out two of my favorite ballads- I was hoping to hear \\"Look away\\" (THE number one song of 1989, how can they exclude it, cmon!), and \\"You're the inspiration.\\" I understand Chicago is back to their jazz fusion roots, but I did grow up during the Peter Cetera/David Foster 80's era, so I can't deny I miss those cheesy power ballads. No complains from EWF...they rock! I hope to see Chicago and Journey do a double concert next! <br />
0553801503|5.0|For all of those who think that most of the chapters are pointless, then you obviously have no idea how a series like this works. Of course it seems like it will have no bearing on the story. Then again, who thought that Eddard sending Beric Dondarrion to kill Gregor in GOT would be significant? It turned out to be very important. We don't know what will happen, but you can bet that Martin wouldn't have written it if it didn't need to be there. I say give him a chance and let him tell the story the way he wants, because he hasn't let us down yet.

Yes, there aren't the principal characters (Jon, Daenerys, Tyrion and also Bran) but the book is well written and the POV, though secondary have all complex personalities. I liked a lot jaime chapters, and those about the Ironborn and their kingsmoot. By now, I can't wait a year for \\"A Dance with Dragons\\"!!

0345423496|2.0|After the disappointment of 2061, which amounted to a space rescue, Clarke's Odyssey series seemed doomed. But 3001 is an excellent addition to the series and attempts to do the impossible: to EXPLAIN 2001's enigmatic ending. Fans of 2001 will be happy to know that Frank Poole's body (sent out to the depths of space compliments of HAL's paranoia) is recovered and, thanks to a thousand years worth of medical advances, revived. He's the man a 1000 years behind the times. Clarke's description and explanation of architecture, space travel, and society are all clear and rooted in modern science. Poole's search for the Bowman-entity actually moves the plot forward and provides an ending every bit as strong as 2010.  <br /> <br />NOTE: Clarke does use some chapters from previous books, but more often than not they are his best passages from previous novels (especially the descriptions of life existing in Jupiter's upper atmospheres from 2010). This is an excellent book. Go find a used paperback and enjoy.  <br />

B000BM6AVA|5.0|System of a Down does not disappoint with this release.  There is no filler and the album is one great song after another.  I found this album to be a little heavier than Mezmerize and the songs seem to flow together a lot better.  I really have enjoyed all of their releases so far, but this is one of my favorites.  I think the best thing about System's music is their ability to have very different sounding music within the same album and yet it all fits together.  They are very dynamic and very diverse with their overall sound.  I find they are never boring and always have something new to offer.  I can't wait until the next tour.  These songs will surely sound good live.  If you like anything this band has ever done you will definitely love this one.
6304936303|4.0|Okay, so, this movie has lots of explosions, lots of swearing (including a 13-year old girl, oh so shocking), and maybe not the greatest plot ever written, but you know, so what?  This is a funny movie that's enjoyable on its levels and doesn't try to be anymore important than that.  If you have a problem with swearing, go to an airfield and listen to jets take off until you're deaf, otherwise you're bound to hear more.  And I happen to find swearing children endearing (South Park, anyone?) and kids swear more than adults anyway.<br /><br />When I was around 12 or 13, this was my favorite movie.  It's got lots of great lines, Damon (the funniest Wayans brother) and Willis have great comedic timing and chemistry and this movie is just filled with hysterical lines.  Damon's performance is full of surprises, displaying he has a range greater than that of a mere clown.<br /><br />This movie is no masterpiece and it shouldn't be on any grown-up's top ten list.  I'm 26 now and have since gotten much better, more mature movies as favorites, but this movie I look back fondly upon as a great comedy with action elements.<br /><br />If you still think this movie is sexist just because it has strippers, a murdered woman (who was a stripper), and a cheating wife, think about all the rotten men in this movie (a lot of which end up dead).  As for the misogynistic characters here and there, the movie clearly portrays them in a negative light.  If you're still committed to calling this movie sexist, listen to what Joe Hollenbeck says, even after his wife cheated on him with his best friend.  \\"I wish water wasn't wet.  I wish the sky wasn't blue.  And I wish I still didn't love my wife.\\"
006097625X|5.0|If you are interested in finding out why graphic novels and comic books are so popular with young people, there is no better introduction to the genre than \\"Understanding Comics\\" by Scott McCloud. Exploring the origins of sequential art beginning with Egyptian hieroglyphics, McCloud contemplates the nature of visual symbolism and the juxtaposition of imagery and language with wit and style. This is a brilliant 224-page comic book, loaded with insight and entertainment. It is also an impressive display of Scott's remarkable versatility as an artist. An excellent tool for anyone interested in young adult literature, and a pleasure to read for it's own sake.

Kate has leukemia and Anna is always giving her blood cells, bone marrow, and lymphocytes.  Now Kate needs a kidney because her kidneys are failing.  Anna decides that she no longer wants to be a donor for Kate.  She understands that if she stops now Kate will die but she really doesn't want to give Kate her kidney because after this she may need something else.  She sues her parents for the right of her own body and they really freak out.  They think that it is just for attention but through the story we figure out the real reason why Anna is going through with this.  At the end of the book something that you would never expect happens and this will affect Kate for that rest of her life. <br />The thing that I like this book is that it switches from character to character and lets you know what each character is thinking.  I also really like the end because it surprises you and really creates a closer relationship with your siblings because you begin to notice how lucky you are to have them.  This book was just good all the way though and never got boring. <br />I think that girls would mainly like this book.  Also, if you like Lorene McDaniel's books that are sort of sad, I think that you would really like this book.  If you like the books that make you cry, you would definitely like this book. <br />
B000062YB1|5.0|Even if your not the biggest Slayer fan, these two albums are amust have for any Metal fan. They are both in the top ten Metal albums ever, along with Overkill's \\"Horrorscope\\" and Exodus' \\"Impact is Imminent\\". If you are a metal fan and don't have these - go get them now. And throw in Testaments \\"Practice What You Preach\\". You will quickly go out and fill your collection with every album available from these bands. As far as these two albums of Slayer go, they really show Slayers talent as musicians. Every track on these albums are fantastic and they vary from each other. And if you have ever seen these tracks done live, you know how great Slayer are as musicians. <br />All Hail Metal! <br /> <br />
B000BM6AVA|5.0|Obviously, System of a Down gained a reputation through hard-hitting music and strong political messages.  Therefore, it's easy to bash Mezmerize/Hypnotize because they seem to have lost much of their political implications and their sonic ferocity.  That dosen't change the fact that these two albums have delivered some of the most influencial music thus far in the 21st century.  The band is doing what pop music is scared of doing, and they're achieving pop icon status doing so, without the music industry dragging them down. <br /> <br />My message is simple: Both these albums are astounding, with Hypnotize delivering the most powerful songs of the two.  This is, personally, the best music of 2005.  Every metal fan unaware of System of a Down should definitely check both Mezmerize and Hypnotize out.
B000BW7QWW|2.0|Serenity starts and ends & has some memorable moments along the way, but to quote fro the original show Firefly \\"My days of not taking you seriously are definitely coming to a middle.\\"  Firefly had made a family out of a cast of characters that reached out & included viewers from just about the very first minute.  Family & loyalty were stressed throughout the too brief run of the series.  Now, in the movie there's a stilted, stiff feel to the crew's interaction & River & Simon are completely out in the cold; Mal specifically states at the beginning that River & Simon aren't part of the crew, directly contradicting his statement from the series that they are part of the crew.  The movie is a lot like my old Buick starting on a cold morning; balky, fitful & reluctant but it gets moving & keeps going, however grudgingly.  Along about the time things are humming right along (with a few scenes that are worthy of the telly programme, humour & wit & action mixing & gliding along in a disbelief suspending trance) Josh Whedon alienates fans with a startling event (no spoilers here!) which I have come to terms with but I know is a love it/hate it polarizing moment.  Curiously, I normally applaud a director & writer willing to take on this kind of challenge, but I guess this once the emotional investment I had was too strong to feel the usual bittersweet satisfaction of a job well done.  Unfortunately, while the story is good, the end stumbles as badly as the beginning.  The scene following the denouement has all the apparent forethought of a natural disaster.  It seems as though the end of the film came as suddenly upon the writer as it does the audience, and has a hastily-slapped-together feel.  In the final analysis, this was a project that had a lot to live up to & has the taint of 'milk-the-cash-while-we-can'.  One is uncertain whether there was a tragic attempt to reach that ideal result from the springboard of excellence, or whether it was a halfhearted jab at the money available from a rabidly loyal fan base (I'm a browncoat).  It's a middling entry into the action sci-fi category, no more or less memorable than most any other entry into the summer scamble.  This is worthy of purchase for fans, but if you're looking for a thrilling sci-fi adventure, check out Farscape, if you haven't already.available from a rabidly loyal fan base (I'm a browncoat).

0805076476|5.0|Fight Club is a very suspensful story that follows a man who is going through a hard time in life. As he trys to solve his problems he meets someone who changes his life forever. This book will keep you on your seat. It is a very exciting book for teens, and I recommend it to everyone.
B000BKDOCA|4.0|I just got my copy of B in the Mix and I'll say that I actually like it more than I thought.  It could definately have more tracks, that's disappointing, but the tracks that are there are very, very good and that's worth something.<br /><br />The \\"Toxic\\" remix is amazing, it's soo clubby and dark! Great song to dance to.  \\"Me Against the Music\\"'s remix might take a second listen to appreciate, but it's also made for a dance floor.  The New track \\"And Then We Kiss\\" is incredible, and worth the price of the CD alone.<br /><br />Other hot highlights are the \\"Slave\\" mix, which really gets going after a minute.  The 2005 mix of Baby One More Time is pretty much the same Davidson Ospinda mix that was popular back in the day, only slightly shorter and with some extra beats.  \\"Early Mornin\\" gets an interesting, yet not very dancey remix.<br /><br />Overall, if you're a huge fan of Britney or remixes than you will love this CD in your collection.  For the casual Britney fan, this may not be the best place start.<br /><br />B+
0440234743|5.0|John Grisham uses his literary prowess to tell a captivating story. Loyalty, greed, corruption, litigation, and sheer innocence hurls the reader into a cornicopia of emotions the doesn't stop swirling together until the very last page. I couldn't put it down!
B0007O38F8|4.0|When I got this album I was scared it was going to be garbage because of the song \\"Candy Shop\\". Turns out I was wrong.  50 still keeps it going with tight ass songs like \\"Piggy Bank\\" and \\"Toy Soldier\\".  This album is pretty damn good.  The only downfall for this album that makes me dislike it is \\"Candy Shop\\" what a horrible song.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|You know, doesn't matter how old I get...it still amazes me why certain people in the entertainment business are famous, and how they manage to maintain fame.  When I read bad reviews for albums like this, it becomes so clear.  The answer?  Most people in the general public have absolutely no sense of what is good music, and what is absolute crap that takes no creativity to make.  This album?  This is probably one of the only bands out there still truly creating, not just hammering out cookie-cutter albums in the shape of everything else in its genre.  This is good s@#t.  A creative metal album which completely separates itself from others in its genre by being creative, displaying some interesting song writing, remaining heavy, and just not being boring!  Great album, great band.
0380002930|5.0|This is clearly the finest book ever written. Period. The stories within the story, i.e., the El-Ehrairah tales, as related by Dandelion, the master storyteller, are as good as, or better than, anything I've read. And yet, in this book, they are a mere aside -- a bonus. That's how great this novel is. What a joy it was to re-read it at age 40, savoring elements I undoubtedly missed at age 14. These rabbits are more endearing and more engaging than any human characters I've read about. No one could come away from this book without a reverence and friendship for Hazel, Fiver, Blackberry, Holly, Silver, Pipkin, Kehaar and of course, \\"Meester PigVig.\\" Even the annoying Bluebell is likable by book's-end. Finally, the way Adams has the storytelling doe interwine El-Ehrairah and Rabscuttle tales with the \\"real\\" stories of Hazel-Rah, Bigwig and Fiver is nothing short of genius. If you read Watership Down before, read it again. If you have never read it, please run to your nearest library and get it now. It is pure \\"flayrah\\" from page 1 to page 481. Long live Hazel-Rah! <br />Also, read a more recent Adams tale, The Outlandish Knight. Another gem from the master. <br />
B000001E3V|4.0|Derek and the Dominoes was a very short lived group. <br />Derek and the boys lasted less than a year. They released one album and did one tour and it was over. <br />During that time Clapton released what many think is the best album of his career (Layla). <br />This is a record of that tour. <br />Got To Get Better In a Little While is the only complete vesion of the song we have. The version on the Crossroads Box Set is not complete. <br />Key To The Highway is another Gem that appears on this CD. <br />This in my mind along with Crossroads are the two best songs on the collection. <br />Have You Ever Loved A Woman is very strong, and remains one of his songs he does in Concert to this day. <br />Bottle Of Red Wine is another outstanding effort. <br />Little Wing is included along with Let It Rain which is one of his finest songs ever. <br />What we have here is a recording of Clapton at that time. <br />This CD is pretty much for people like me who are collectors.
0224071262|5.0|This is a very good book. Anyone interested in recent Chinese history will learn a lot from it. Indeed the authors are not dispassionate observers. But that does not necessarily detract from the enormous value of the book. I grew up in Beijing, China through the period of Mao's cultural revolution, and lived through many of the events in the book. And I'd say to those who wonder if things could really be so bad - yes, Mao was that evil. This despite the fact that I was among the relatively previleged ones as my parents were party cadres who got through unscathed. Read the book if you can. Folks in China won't be so lucky; the book is totally banned there.
B000002G8N|3.0|Another Ticket is Claptons last recording with Robert Stigwood before he signs with Reprise Records. <br />There are some good blues efforts on here including, Black Rose, Blow Wind Blow,, And Hold Me Lord. <br />Another Ticket the title cut is the best song on the album. <br />I relate to the lyrics from time to time. <br />\\"Everytime you think you've paid the price, you turn around and find another ticket\\" I Cant Stand it spent some time on the charts. <br />This CD is for Hard Core collectors like myself
B0009VRHLK|5.0|Warning: This review may contain some spoilers for the uninitiated.<br /><br />For those readers remotely familiar with Vincent Gallo's Buffalo 66, I need not really say much to pat the man on his back. Buffalo '66 film had layers of dark humor, lots of heart, & quirkiness to make us fall in love with his craft.<br /><br />Gallo returns with a another love story of sorts but there is really no dark humor or quirkiness here whatsoever. This time around he introduces us to a lonely, lost soul by the name of Bud Clay traveling solo on the highway after just finishing a bike race. Along the way back to California, he meets three different women who all appear to be lacking what it seems he longs for. Love.<br /><br />In between the meetings of these three unique women, we see many long shots of driving while hearing rather somber music while often iinclude shots of rain which prolong this deep feeling of sadness that our protagonist can't seem to shake.Thus, Brown Bunny is essentially a lugubrious ballad placed on film about the journeys we sometimes make only to find that we can never go back to what we once had. Gallo shows us how much we really want to have hope even though our heart has all but convinced us that there is literally no hope to be found.<br /><br />Contrary to what reviewers have written, Brown Bunny is a very soft if not slow moving film with very tender scenes much like some of the moments in Buffalo '66. Although the ending will burn you for a long time, the film does have a tremendously huge heart & the ideas Gallo presents here will stay with you long after the final frame.<br /><br />Brown Bunny itself has two basic meanings although I'm sure each viewer will pick up something totally different. Bud Clay's girlfriend left a pet bunny with her mother when she moved to California & never came back for it. My interpretation: Bud felt like he'd abandoned his love interest when she needed him the in the most crucial moments. Also, Clay had given his girlfriend a chocolate bunny for Easter which she had eaten completely (or so we learn through dialog) & thrown up shortly afterwards. In the most heartfelt dialogue between the two main characters , we learn that he kissed her anyway because he truly loved her even after she vomited.<br /><br />And now the part you've been waiting for. There is a very graphic oral sex scene at the end of the film (the last ten minutes to be exact) but I personally didn't feel this took anything away from the film. The ending was intended to be very dramatic, emotional, & raw. Highly recommended!ster which she had eaten completely (or so we learn through dialog) & thrown up shortly afterwards.

B000002LN9|5.0|24 Nights is a concert that was recorded over the period of 9 evenings at the Royal Albert Hall in London. <br />During the couse of the 24 evenings he uses essentially 2 bands and a band with an orchestra. <br />The fist installment is his current band at the time. <br />They do songs from his latest CD. The songs include, Pretending, Bad Love, Old Love, and Wonderful Tonight. <br />The second phase is a blues phase with Robert Cray and Buddy Guy playing guitar with Chuck Berrys piano player Johnny Johnson. <br />The Blues tracks in my mind are the best on the CD. <br />Clapton does Watch Yourself, Worried Life Blues and Voodoo Man, as well as Have You Ever Loved A Woman. <br />The third phase is with an orchestra that includes Bell Bottom Blues, Hard Times and Edge of Darkness. <br />The version of Wonderful Tonight is haunting. He slows the song down and with Katie Kasssons vocals the song is outstanding. <br />If you like Blues or if you like EC you need to get this one.
B00079018K|5.0|This CD is amazing and if all you dense people cant get past sony's stupid screw up then you are just ignorant and foolish.
B00006NSGX|4.0|I was able to see Eric Clapton in Oakland a couple of nights before the performance in LA at the Staples Center. <br />Having seen Clapton several times before and not seeing him do many songs by Derek and the Dominoes, I was able to enjoy the concert. <br />The Cd starts out with some very strong acoustic songs, especially his version of Key To The Highway, which was the best song of the evening. <br />He also did Bell Bottom Blues, Tears in Heaven and If I Could Change the World. <br />He also performs My Fathers Eyes and River of Tears on the electric guitar. <br />Thse renditions though good were not as good as his Pilgrim concert performances. <br />He does do songs off Reptile, however they are not his best songs from that album. <br />He does a very tire version of Badge and his classic song Cocaine. Cocaine seems almost out of place, and it didnt do much for me. <br />He goes into Hoochie Coochie Man and then Have You Ever Loved a Woman which satisfy my sweet tooth for blues. <br />Next is the standard Wonderful Tonigh with David Sanscious doing a very unique keyboard solo. <br />He then does Layla and Sunshine of your Love. <br />Eric has the audience buzzing and slows the tempo down with the classic from the Wizard of Oz, Somewhere over the Rainbow. <br />He uses a jazz chord progression and turns the song into his own, much the way Ray Charles did on the movie soundtrack Sleepless in Seattle. Eric showed us a side of him we rarely see. <br />All night long his guitar solos are flawless as his stratocaster cries into the night. <br />This is a very solid live effort...........enjoy
B00005JNTX|3.0|After a long delay, I finally have seen Sin City.  The film is undeniably a visual masterpiece.  The movie looks unlike anything I have ever seen.  I will preface the rest of the review this, I am not familiar with Frank Miller's stories.  I cannot imagine that the movie watcher has to have any familiarity with the content, but I have not.  I usually love movies like this, like Pulp Fiction.  However, I just could not get into this movie at all.<br /><br />I was not put off by the non-ending violence, but what is the point?  The characters are stale and there is not one person in the movie worthy of emotional investment.  The movie plays like a visually stunning gore filled yawn.  After the two hours were over I did not care one way or the other about the characters.  I am sure there will be more tales from Sin City, but unless there is more character development, I think I will pass.
B00005AREQ|4.0|Jeff Beck has always been one of Rocks premiere guitarists. <br />This is Becks' first solo instrumental album. <br />It was produced by George Martin. <br />On this CD you will find a very stong version of the Beatles classic, She's A Woman. <br />Cause We Ended As Lovers is another very strong effort and it has almost a blues feel to it. <br />Freeway Jam also appears on this album and is one of his finest instrumental songs ever. <br />Diamond Dust ends the CD on a very strong note. <br />This is Jeff Beck at his best. I would recomend this album to anyone.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|From the beginning to the end a true confession of non stop dance beats intertwining and giving you a sense of wanting more.
B0000026KQ|5.0|If you have never heard of Jeff Beck or you simply want to get acquainted this is the Cd you want to hear.  There is not a bad cut on this entire CD.   It is hard driving Rock the way it is meant to be played and only the way Jeff Beck can play it.  Jeff Beck along with Jimi Hendrix are the most revolutionary players in Rock history.  Both are not just master guitarists but master technicians as well.  They both are able to find sounds on the guitar that no one else has found.  Guitar shop opens the CD on a very strong note and sets the tone.  Savoy which is next is a personal favorite and features the keyboards of Jan Hammer.  Big Block slows the pace a little but is nothing short of a masterpiece.  Where Were You is another outstanding effort, and many think is the best song on this CD. Two Rivers is another song that will get your attention.  Sling Shot is the finale to a very fine CD. Jeff Beck is probably the best kept secret in Rock.   If this CD does not get your attention not much will.  You get to listen to one of the masters at his finest moment.  This is a must for any Rock collector whether you like Beck or not. After this CD, I dont know how you wouldnt like Jeff Beck
B000BM6AVA|3.0|I was a fan until Toxicity was released then they got predictable and boring. This on the other hand is much better than their three previous releases. <br /> <br />The album itself has varied material but overall it sort of blends. <br />Highlights include Holy Mountains, Vicinity Of Obscenity (completely insane but cool), Hypnotize, and Lonely Day. <br /> <br />Daron does as much singing as Serj on this one which is a plus. <br />Serj even sings better which I did not believe possible. <br /> <br />I really give it a 3.5/5 and thats a lot coming from me. I hated them from Toxicity until this release. Overall it's a worthwhile purchase and proves a band can redeem themselves after a while.
B000002G8L|5.0|Eric Clapton was on tour in 1979 and played at Budokan. <br />This performance is a recording of that night. <br />At the time Clapton was in a country mood and many of his songs were country. <br />The songs of note are: Tulsa Time with some very strong slide guitar played the way it was on Backless. <br />Lay Down Sally from Slowhand also appears on this CD. Wonderful Tonight is another strong effort. <br />The version of After Midnight on here is a good version and the only live version I know of by Clapton. <br />The entire second Disc is blues at Clapton does a medley of songs including Double Trouble, Ramblin on my mind,, Cocaine and Further on up the Road. <br />Setting me up is a Mark Knopfler song that is also very strong. <br />As I said possibly his best live album ever.
B00005NTJM|5.0|Some J.T.fans may not like this debut album, with a line up and material different to that which later became characteristic of  the 'Tull' sound. However, be it known, when they cut this - their first album, J.T. had just won first prize at Sunbury Jazz Festival. In a J.T.@members re-union toward the end-of-the-millennium, Mick Abrahams and Glenn Cornick made very self-effacing comments about their role in J.T.    <br /> <br /> Whatever one thinks about later changes of material, line-up etc, the Jazz/Blues/Rock format of the material on this album/CD captures the atmosphere of British Jazz/Blues clubs in the late 60's - a very exciting time. The recording has a rawness to it, and sounds pretty much like J.T.'s live performances at the time.   <br /> <br /> Ian Anderson's stage presence was electrifying, hearing him humming and jazz-talking with the flute, one leg held up like a stork. His blues vocals and harmonica work were also excellent. Mick Abrahams must surely be the most under-rated guitarist of the era. Abrahams' version of 'Cat's-Squirrel' surpasses Clapton's by far and stands out - in my mind, as one of the most articulate pieces of electric guitar work, of its era. Abrahams' used an electric guitar to the full, bringing out its complete range of tonal colours.@He makes the 'bassy' strings hum with sustain - as beautifully as the treble, a lovely, rich sound, paralleled by Hendrix's use of bassy sustain in 'The Wind Cries Mary. One gets sick of hearing lead guitarists 'screaming' on the E-string, as if the instrument had only one string - and voice.  <br /> <br /> I saw J.T. again - after Mick Abrahams' departure, with Martin Barre on lead, playing the material found on 'Stand-Up.' Ian Anderson is a versatile musician. It was good stuff, and h@can see the appeal of the later 'Tull' material. In fact, J.T. has been through several re-incarnations with Ian and various friends. hcan see why people want to move on to fresh pasturesAbut to my way of thinking, the old Blues/Jazz line up and material took a lot of beating.  <br />
B000BJS4OY|5.0|In 1981 I saw Bruce in L.A. simply because of his live reputation. I was not a fan, but I am open minded. 5 songs into the show it was clearly the best show I had seen. It still is. I bought last row seat behind the stage for his last show, took a friend, named ironically Bruce, who hated Springsteen.He was blown away as much I had had been at the earlier show.<br /><br />Sadly the next few times I saw him, twice in '85 once in '99, were missing the spark of the earlier shows I saw. His band got too big,no need for his wife or two extra guitarists. So when I saw a complete concert was on DVD from 6 years before I saw him it was something that could not wait until Christmas.<br /><br />I have always favored his first 2 albums, and there is plenty of it on this DVD. This is one of the single most important concerts on film. The only thing I would look more foreward to is a filmed version of The Who Live at Leeds.<br /><br />As for the BTR disc, it sounds great, but how many times after 30 years will I listen to it? About as much as Abbey Road, Sticky Fingers, or Dark Side of the Moon.
B00000AFGM|5.0|And this album makes me feel 'mechanical' too. Marilyn has proven to everybody that he is the master of his domain when it comes to modern steel rock. He is one of the best rocker and the only most controversial artist of the 90's. I admire his work musically and performance wise. I could care less about the lyrics when his musical work is so hardcore. I don't really agree with his lyrics but on the flip side of it, his lyrics show extreme maturity in terms of his writing abilities and I respect that. Those who gave Marilyn bad reviews need to stay in church instead of coming over here to pass their 2 cents. Nobody cares about your opinion so why don't you go rate something gospel. And what is up with this 'A Kid's Review'. You need to quit living in the 80's talking about Alice Cooper and everything. More importantly I have read your other reviews and you truly sound like a KID, so please go back to your mama cuz it;s B-feeding time!! Mechanical Animals RULES!!! Just the overall rating speaks for itself and that's what counts!!

0553582445|5.0|I've decided in this review, to do all 3 books in the Tawny Man trilogy, (that being Fool's Errand, Golden Fool  and Fool's Fate), as  they are intricately connected (as you might expect)  in the main characters, story line and writing quality.<br /><br />I enjoyed this series but with some minor reservations... let me explain<br /><br />The pros:<br /><br />The prose and story telling is of the highest quality with detailed description of persons, places and things. There is great character development throughout the entire trilogy; people you really like (or dislike) with a passion, and as with most fantasy novels, there is some magic and characters or creatures with special talents. The plot, although slow to develop, is interesting and intriguing; it grips you, making you eager to get back to these novels whenever you can. The writing itself has a nice, easy to read flow to  it and  follows in a logical sequence.<br /><br />The cons: Two niggling concerns: (and loss of ½ star)<br /><br />1.)The main character; ( Fitz) is best described as a reluctant hero with an overwhelming sense of guilt and continual self depreciation. In  Fitz's opinion, everything  that has ever gone wrong in this story can be traced back to the way he handled a situation in the past; and he is FOREVER agonizing about these thoughts (what he might have done different... etc.) Needless to say, three  novels of this, and this character trait starts to wear a little thin.<br /><br />2.)Lack of action; I realize a great novel does not have to have \\"action\\", however having said that, I've always liked my fantasy novels to have a fair amount of \\"action\\" with some battles or combat (large scale or small).  That is not to say this series has no action, because it does, but somehow I wanted more. The few skirmishes seemed so far apart, and I must admit this was somewhat disappointing.<br /><br />Although it may appear that my \\"concerns\\" mentioned above appear huge, such is not the case. This is  a deep, rich fantasy series of epic proportions; well written and detailed, but just misses the mark of true greatness because of the shortcomings mentioned above. 4 ½ stars.written and detailed, but just misses the mark of true greatness because of the shortcomings mentioned above. 4  stars.
B000AMJG4Y|1.0|First off let me say that I'm a *huge* fan of the PlayStation game in which this is based on and I'm an even bigger fan of all things CGI. Naturally, when I had the opportunity to see this a couple of weeks ago (Japanese release borrowed from a friend) I was thrilled. Alas, I was *hugely* disappointed. Final Fantasy: Advent Children is nothing more than a long and boring series of ridiculously complicated action sequences designed merely to show off what the animators could do with a computer, and woven together by *very short* bits of stupid, incomprehensible dialogue. To say the plot is weak and makes no sense would be the understatement of the year: THERE IS NO PLOT. <br /> <br />HERE BE SPOILERS: <br /> <br />At one point in the \\"movie\\" a bunch of kids are abducted and hypnotized into some sort of trance with no one bothering to even try to explain the purpose of such action. Later, a big monster shows up in the middle of Midgar and starts obliterating people and buildings left and right (yeah, think Godzilla) for no other apparent reason than to have an excuse for the heroes of the game to pop out of nowhere and save the day in the most absurd action sequence EVER -without even saying 'Hello' to each other first. Oh, and remember the kids in trance? Well, they miraculously snap out of it, again with no explanation <br /> <br />Anyhow...my final advise is stay off this title. If you're nostalgic about the game and definitely need to see it, borrow it from a friend like I did or get a bootleg copy. This is NOT worth your money. <br /> <br />R.V.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|The nay-sayers just don't get it.  Many of them are simply anti-retro.  But SKY CAPTAIN isn't so much retro as it is timeless!  Like RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, THE ROCKETEER, and the approaching Peter Jackson's KING KONG, the things that make SKY CAPTAIN so enjoyable have been handed down through the decades in all great adventure films.  Yes, I said \\"adventure\\" films.  And there-in lies the key to the love-it or hate-it attitude toward SKY CAPTAIN.  Many of us, like movie-lovers of times past AND present, love to willingly suspend our disbelief and surrender ourselves to the filmakers manipulations.  Sometimes we win and enjoy the experience of seeing a well-made motion picture.  Alas, sometimes we lose and suffer the disappointment of an unimaginative movie whose makers lacked any creative impulse.  But we know it's worth the risk!  Because when it pays off, it's oh so sweet.  Then there's a second type of movie viewer.  One who steels himself in advance against the \\"fakeness\\" of it all.  One whose warped pride would never allow himself to be \\"manipulated\\" by a mere flick, even when that emotional surrender could end up spelling FUN!  SKY CAPTAIN knows what fun is all about.  SKY CAPTAIN's middle name is grand high adventure, played out in a retro, and yet timeless, fashion.  CGI?  Did RKO skimp on special effects when they made the masterpiece that is KING KONG in 1933?  No, they pulled out all, and I do mean ALL, the stops and gave the world a special effects bonanza such as had never been dreamt of by movie audiences.  Cardboard characters?  Well, so, I'm kind of a cardboard personality myself.  Wanna make something of it?  If you ever liked RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK or THE ROCKETEER, then you owe it to yourself to see the coolness that is SKY CAPTAIN.  If you're looking forward to the new KING KONG, or liked the original '33 version for that matter, then you'll enjoy SKY CAPTAIN.  If you never missed the WILD, WILD WEST TV show, then get ready for the WILD, WILD 1930'S because your new adventure is waiting...930'S because your new adventure is waiting...
B00097DXZS|1.0|Strongly recommend not buying.  A couple of reviewers below stated that this CD does not contain the XCP rootkit.  While they are technically correct this CD DOES CONTAIN the Sony/SunnComm MediaMax software that has been proven to be a big security risk also.  The software installs even if one rejects the EULA; the software goes on to install regardless.  For details see Professor Alex Halderman's website at Princeton University, \\"Not Again!

B000B0WODA|4.0|Franz Ferdinand's sophomore album, \\"You Could Have It So Much Better\\", is more proof that they are by far one of the best British rock groups. Yet, I still must admit that I really did like their first album, \\"Franz Ferdinand\\", a bit better. Nonetheless, Franz Ferdinand, led by lyric genius Alex Kapranos, still keeps their British charm and retro coolness to this must-have album. <br />I should probably start out with the things I questioned about this album. First of all, the song \\"You're the Reason I'm Leaving\\" is recorded right after \\"Evil and a Heathen\\" , and while both are great songs, their chorus melodies are extremely similar. Also, the song \\"Eleanor Put Your Boots On\\" sounds so much like a Beatles song I questioned its originality - but it's still a nice song. <br />But there is much more to love about this album. \\"The Fallen\\" is a powerful political number, with a twangy guitar and rugged vocals. \\"Do You Want To\\" is an upbeat and fun pop-rock track that you wouldn't mind listening to over and over. But the track that stood out the most to me was \\"This Boy\\". With its muffled chorus and sour guitar, this is a good example of what these UK boys can concoct. <br />Overall, I can honestly say that Franz Ferdinand certainly didn't fall toward a sophomore slump, although it doesn't quite compare to the punch I got from the first album. But hey - it's good music. (:
6302719631|2.0|I first tried watching this movie before reading the book.  I didn't like it at all and turned it off after half an hour.  Several years later, when I read the book and enjoyed it immensely, I thought perhaps I hadn't understood the story well enough when I first watched the movie.  So I tried watching it again, and this time I got almost all the way through.  But it was ultimately a waste of time.   <br /> <br />  I really like the book, but the movie is poorly made.  The acting is bad (acting lessons are needed, plus the actors had no idea who or what their characters were supposed to be like), the picture is often out of focus or grainy (not just due to being VHS, but also due to poor cinematography), and the story has just been screwed up.   <br /> <br />  The book was a satirical, albeit dark, comedy, and this movie had the flawed notion to try (unsuccessfully) to be a drama--it bordered more on the melodramatic.  Skip the movie, read the book.
B000AP04FG|5.0|Hopefully this will be first of many in a series of \\"Mr and Mrs Smith\\" movies.  I guess that will depend on whether Angie and Brad can keep it together, but that is beside the point.  The movie should be judged and rated on its own merit and not on the fact that Jen couldn't keep Brad in line.  The movie is lots of fun to watch and the chemistry between the actors is obvious.  My wife liked it and she absolutely despises Angelina.  Forget about what happened offstage and enjoy the movie!
0141439793|5.0|Austen shows her mastery of subtle humor in this fun-spirited Gothic satire.  Other reviewers have commented that they found the first chapter boring because it just talks about what an ordinary, mediocre person the heroine is.  But I was cracking up and laughing throughout the whole book, and especially through the first chapter.  Some authors try to make a big deal about how special their main character is, or about how extraordinary things can happen to their normal character.  But Austen makes it clear that, most of the time, ordinary stuff happens to ordinary people, no matter how much they wish for excitement and adventure.  Though the plot and other characters are not as well-developed as in other Austen novels, this is no reason to give it fewer stars as Austen is far better than most authors even when she herself is \\"mediocre\\".  I found this book to be smart, sassy, and lighthearted.  But the humor is very, very subtle.  You need to be either very quick on the uptake or have a cynical mind to catch some of it.
B000002L7J|5.0|This is the album that got me hooked on the Smiths back in 1986.  A friend had copied the album recorded to tape.  I avoided listening to it for several months, until one afternoon listening to Rusholme Ruffians.  At the time (at the age of 16), I could not make out what Morrissey was singing, nor would have I understood the lyrics if they had been printed.  However, I indentified with the music.  Although Morrissey seemed to sing off-key at times, there was a sense of urgency that was very honest and passionate.  My favorite songs from the album include:  <br />I want the one I can't have (\\"He killed a policeman when he was 13, and somehow this really impressed me\\").  There is something very gritty and authentic about this song.  Morrissey sings it with such passion.  Great lyrics, too. <br />That joke isn't funny anymore- My favorite part of the song is when Morrissey sings, \\"When they fall down\\".  Johnny Marr's guitar playing sounds spiraling and dreamlike.  <br />Well I wonder- Convincingly morose. <br />Barbarism begins at home- At first I did not think much of this song, but it has grown on me over the years.  I enjoy the ending of the song with Morrissey moaning over Johnny Marr's instrumental.   <br />Other highlights include the Headmaster's Ritual, What she said and Nowhere Fast (one of my favorite lyrics: \\"And when I'm lying in my bed I think about life And I think about death And neither one particularly appeals to me\\").  I am an odd Smiths fan as I find \\"How soon is now?\\" to be unlistenable.  The song \\"Meat is Murder\\" is amusing, but probably my second least favorite track from the album. <br />
0553801503|4.0|I don't think the book focussed on just minor characters. I don't consider Cersei and Jaime Lannister; Arya and Sansa Stark minor. This installment advances the story fairly well. Actually, I am concerned for the opposite reason: I want to see what else happens to THESE characters (the ending makes you wonder)- if Mr. Martin is going to focus on the rest of the characters in the next book I feel I will be missing out. Either way I have no complaints with the direction this story is going. Also, I love the fact that these books are far from cliche- I haven't seen one \\"happy ending\\" yet.
B0002NRRAG|2.0|Like the title reads ... if you think you will enjoy a dose of  Billy Holliday infused with the New Orleans sound, then you might enjoy this CD.  I did not.
B000001FTA|5.0|The first thing that comes to mind is: Hell, they could sound \\"pop\\" and still be hard rockers. So why they never played on radio, with few exceptions like \\"boys are back in town\\".<br /><br />Bad Reputation is an great effort to make Thin Lizzy a successful band without losing their style. It is clear that they mixed here on this record the rawness from Jailbreak, and the experimentations from Johnny the Fox\\". So, it's an album like \\"midway\\", but never half succeeded. No way, this is really a good piece of 70's hard rock, even better than most of the trash done during 80's and 90's when it comes to hard rock.<br /><br />A sad mark to this album is the fact that it is the last time Robbo and Gorham put their guitar to fight together in a studio. But what a great way to say farewell to arms! I prefer Robbo a little bit, but Gorham is terrific, there ain't no such thing as a bad riff from the beginning to the end.<br /><br />Some people may consider this album kinda laid-back stuff, but try to sse from another side, it's hard rock, with melodic phrases, without being glossy or fancy.<br /><br />Really heavy tunes: Bad Reputation - opium trail - Killer without a cause<br /><br />Other great tracks: That woman is gonna break your heart (the most beautiful Lizzy's ballad, along with Sarah)<br /><br />Southbound- highway style song<br /><br />Soldier of fortune - great opening track, beautiful guitar solo<br /><br />Anyway the whole album is great, except maybe for Dear Lord, but, any song put after That Woman... is simply unfair.<br /><br />In a four years space, those guys sent to the world such gems as Fighting, Jailbreak, Johnny the Fox, Bad Reputation, Live and Dangerous and Black Rose. Man, I mean, they were at least AWESOME!
B00006DEFA|3.0|When I heard that the Amadeus Director's Cut with deleted scenes reinserted back into the movie was coming out, I couldn't have been more excited.  This is a great movie, and one of my favorite movies of all time.<br /><br />Let's start with the extras.  There was a \\"making-of\\" documentary that is interesting, and not a whole lot else really.  Pretty standard Director's Cut stuff - not bad, but could have really been souped up even more than this.  The packaging is okay, but again, nothing fantastic.  Just the usual slim case with 2 discs inside with the easily-damaged thin cardboard slip sleeve for the dvd case.<br /><br />But the worst part was, when I watched this edition with the extra scenes back in the movie, I quickly realized why they were cut in the first place.  The extra scenes are not that great, and they make certain parts of the movie much less effective and less dramatic.  The extra scene with Salieri and Constanze Mozart with regards to \\"the price\\" was okay, but honestly this scene did not change the relationship between the two characters, and really didn't do anything besides add run time to the movie and increase the rating to 'R'.  The deleted scenes in movies are removed for a reason, usually to make the movie flow better, and the Amadeus Director's Cut is no exception to that rule.  Trust me my friends, stick with the plain Jane theatrical version of Amadeus - the version of the movie that won all of the awards.  Although there are barely any extras, and you have to flip the disc mid-way through the movie, this version of the movie is far superior.<br /><br />After watching the Director's Cut, I promptly sold it on ebay and hung on to my bare bones version of Amadeus.  To quote the emperor: \\"There are simply too many notes.  Just cut a few, and it will be perfect.\\"  Apply this to the extra scenes in the Director's Cut - cut a few, and it will be perfect.  Extra scenes or no, still a great movie, but the theatrical version is definitely superior.<br /><br />What we really need is a definitive version of Amadeus in a collector's tin, with documentaries, trailers, booklets, etc. etc. etc., with the extra scenes available if you want to watch them, but SEPARATE from the movie.perior. <br /> <br />What we really need is a definitive version of Amadeus in a collector's tin, with documentaries, trailers, booklets, etc. etc. etc., with the extra scenes available if you want to watch them, but SEPARATE from the movie.
B00005K3O4|5.0|Basic Plot: Aliens from outer space come to invade the Earth with diabolical plans. But these aren't normal extraterrestrials. These are space-clowns with one deadly sense of humor! They go around a small town, terrorizing the residents and turning their bodies into cotton candy cocoons. A small group of teens are the only ones willing to accept this crazy situation, and take it upon themselves to rid their town of these murderous bozos. But, of course, that will be easier said than done!<br /><br />In my opinion, Killer Klowns From Outer Space cannot be mistaken. Whether it's the DVD cover, the tagline (\\"In Space No One Can Eat Ice Cream\\"), or the absurd plot, you pretty much know what you're getting into. And I for one enjoyed it. It was everything I'd hoped it would be -- a mix of sci-fi, comedy, and horror that's entertaining from beginning to end. I've seen my share of bad B-movies, and I was prepared for the worst, but instead got a pleasant surprise. Sure, the acting isn't too spiffy, but who cares about the humans? The other-worldly clowns are evilly cool combinations of live actors and mechanical suits. The masks are able to blink, shift their eyebrows, and stretch big nasty smiles across their faces for a delightfully sinister effect. I'll admit it's not completely believable, but it's certainly more than the obvious rubber mask too many movies like this settle with. And with plenty of kooky gadgets and tricks, there are some interesting kills as well. This is rated PG-13, so there's not a lot of gore, but we're still treated to absurdly humorous slaughter throughout the movie. There are too many memorable scenes to mention here, but trust me: Killer Klowns From Outer Space will have any fan of horror-comedies in B-movie heaven. The makers of this flick obviously know how to have a good time, and don't waste any effort on trying to sneak seriousness or morals into the story. Just good 'ol stupid fun! And, with a nice load of special features (including 5 featurettes, audio commentary by the Chiodo Brothers, bloopers, 2 deleted scenes, and more), there's plenty of reasons to purchase this DVD. So what are you waiting for? Step right up and enjoy a funhouse ride that is truly out of this world!es, audio commentary by the Chiodo Brothers, bloopers, 2 deleted scenes, and more), there's plenty of reasons to purchase this DVD.

B000084T18|1.0|Man I listened to this album and I gotta tell ya, there are some gullible folks out there. It is one of the best examples of the worst that rap music has to offer these days. Give me P.E. or classic Dr. Dre anyday over this drivel. It is easier to sell crass to the masses when the biggest rap personalities are a**es. That's better than any thing on this album. Boo Ya! <br /> <br />
B000BGH22W|2.0|At first, I was really....really disappointed that John Williams was not doing the 'Goblet of Fire' and so I actually completely ignored the soundtrack. But then I went and saw the movie. Boy, what a suprise! <br />  From the beginning all the way to the end...amazing! I was blown by Patrick's music! His style is definitely different from Mr. Williams' but Doyle's style certainly did fit. I loved the music so much that right after I left the theatre I ran to Wal-Mart and bought a copy. His 'pretty' music was moving and his tense music was awesome! I was kind of glad to hear something different from Mr. Williams' somewhat repetitive style.(No offense, Mr. Williams.)  <br /> The music is triumphant,tense,dark,funny,and purely magical. It beats the other Harry Potter soundtracks. Ehh...well...at least the first two... Mr. Williams did a very good job on the 'Prisoner of Azkaban'. But yeah,..I was very impressed and I encourage you to definitely get this soundtrack. Oh, the movie was awesome also. <br />   P.S. The last three tracks aren't my favorites but they're kind of fun to listen to....
076113719X|5.0|I started buying this calendar about 4 years ago.  Every year around this time, I begin to get nervous... Will they reprint the Mom's Family Calendar?  I am never disappointed.  Would be totally lost without it.  Traditional calendars usually do not have space for everyone's \\"happenings\\".  This is the best because I (Mom-in-Charge) am able to see everything that is going on and for whom at a glance.  My kiddos are to the point of checking in on it too.  I usually name a space for each member, me and 2 kids, then make a special \\"family\\" one.  That way everyone knows that this is an event that affects the entire family and all are to attend.  Won't buy any other calendar or planner for this need.

B000B8QEYC|1.0|Di Liberto's quip sums this up. I defy anyone to tell one Enya CD from another, and this is no exception. That said, regurgitating the same set of reverb certainly buys you a nice castle south of Dublin. Living next door to Bono hasn't done anything for her sense of adventure musically, but she knows what her public will swallow gladly. <br />The pretentiousness of \\"inventing\\" a \\"language\\" speaks for itself. In fact, spills out volumes. Perhaps she'll have a tryst with Jon Anderson and the world will implode with the arrival of their demon child. In the meantime, I'd like to think the world has moved beyond this treacle. Not so....

B000BO0LLS|5.0|I dont really know why some compare Madonna to Mariah Carey?? They are two different Singers. First of all, Mariah is a much better singer. She is famous for her voice and writes and performs so much harder songs to sing than Madonna. Anyone can sing Madonna songs. She sings discodance with so much mixing and fixing in the studio, sometimes I dont even hear its her. And all the changes of style. Mariah dont need that, beacuse she has her voice. Which she uses to the max on this album. I think the album is great RnB, soul,pop. 5 Stars to her. And she sounds wonderful as ever. 4 millon copies sold in the states alone and more to be sold. She will go back to number 3 or 4 on the billboard 200 this week. after all this months. It proves that she is back and stronger than ever. Madonnas album is good also, 3 stars, to much mixing and fixing in the studio for me. But why dont like them both. is that so hard? They are both two talented women who have made it very far. But please dont compare Madonna With Mariah. Compare Mariah to other great vocalists like Celine, Whitney or Barbara. No change of stiles but still got it. Compare Madonna with Britney and Kylie, and maybe J.Lo even. mixing and fixing. Change of stiles from one record to another, haircolor and you name it. Thats not bad all the time but gets boring after a while. all Ms dont sound the same. And thats what counts.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000B8QEYC|4.0|This album does not offer anything new, that is a good thing for those who like the Enya sound. It is a more relaxing album, that is good. Great for after-work music, soothing as Enya's voice can be, and soothing is ok. Relaxing, soothing, calming, bedtime story is ...Enya. For other moments i'll play Sinead O'Connor's new fab reggae album 'Throw Down your Arms'. Two new recordings you don't want to miss this season.
B00082IJ08|5.0|I just need to take a minute to reflect on the Gorillaz.  <br />The Gorillaz are GENIUS. Simply GENIUS. Other than that, I am speechless.  <br /> <br />I got this album a while ago and I listen to it all the time.  <br />Nevertheless, about two minutes ago I had the uncontrollable urge to join the Amazon review-an-album-bandwagon. <br /> <br />Gorillaz are hip-hop but not really hip-hop.  <br />Gorillaz are easy on the ears but pure quirk. <br />Gorillaz are banal but poetic.  <br />Gorillaz are happy beats with sad lyrics. <br />Gorillaz are extreme. <br />...Honestly, I have never heard anything like it (and I am a self-diagnosed music addict).  <br /> <br />Can anyone name me another band that is so fearless and so extremely different from anything you have ever heard before?  <br /> <br />Ok. Not so speechless after all. Funk. <br />
B000063Y8F|5.0|I've been a fan of R&ouml;sle kitchen tools for over 10 years, but I only recently tired of mincing garlic and bought R&ouml;sle's garlic press. My oldest R&ouml;sle tools were made in Germany; this press is made in China, but I don't notice any difference in quality. It's quite a hefty 18/10 stainless steel tool, shiny and beautifully finished on all edges, with a loop to hang it by on the end of the handle. The press will hold one large clove of garlic or maybe 2 small cloves. No need to peel the garlic if you don't want to. This press will crush garlic peeled or unpeeled with about the same amount of effort. It takes some force to crush the garlic, and you may want to use 2 hands to grip the handles if you have small hands. But nothing Herculean is required. A small adult or older child can do it pretty easily.<br /><br />The sieve that the garlic is pressed through pops up for easy cleaning, so you don't have to get your sponge or dishcloth inside the press to clean out what's left of the garlic. When not in use, the press is locked in the closed position by catching on little nodules on each side of the garlic basket. Just pull to open. I wonder if the nodules will wear down with time, so that the press can no longer be locked shut. But I guess that R&ouml;sle put locks on both sides of the tool in order to reduce that possibility. This method of crushing garlic does leave some waste in the press, but it's much faster and easier than mincing with a knife. The garlic press is exactly 7 inches (18 cm) long excluding the hanging loop, 7 ¾ inches (20 cm) with the loop.
B000BNTM96|5.0|As a QOTSA fan, you can't get any better than this. <br /> <br />What I really appreciate is that Josh really seems to care for his fans.  For the price of one CD, you get the live CD and then a 2-hour show shot in HD (widescreen 16:9) and mixed in surround (The liner notes don't say if there is a DTS 5:1 mix).  <br /> <br />But more importantly, the DVD shows the band at their best.  You can really see the joy of five musicians making music.  What I'm most happy about is the song selection of the DVD. <br /> <br />As much as I love PTL, Queens put a lot more emphasis on their older material and some B-Sides.  If your a Queens fan, you have to buy this!
B00008G9JM|5.0|While so many of the rock bands of the seventies were \\"just a little touch of make up, just a little touch of bull, just a three chord trick embedded in your platform soul\\" (as Ian Anderson put it on \\"Crazed Institution\\") Tull were doing things that were in another space and time. And while not everything worked, they were never dull. A Passion Play has stood the test of time. Like a great piece of art, you can return to it endless times and discover something new. It is all at once pathetically shallow and profoundly deep, toe tappingly musical and irritatingly dischordant, it threatens to soar into brilliance, only to dwindle into nothingness, it is beautiful and clumsy, elegant and gawkish. It is music with a sense of humour. Like the comedy masters of the time who would never advertise a punch line, Tull keep you guessing. You never get what you expect. After all, familiarity breeds contempt.  <br />A classic. Five stars. <br />

As with all her previous releases, this scores and I thank GOD there is talent like this out there in the universe. Having been (dancing, clubbing) on the music scene in Europe and knowing that the American perspective isn't exactly everything, the fact that this ICON manages to surprise and drive the world beat again and again, speaks volumes. Enough said.

Landon's promise to himself is broken, but do the two really fall in love?  He takes her places, walks her home, goes to the orphanage with her, and even invites her over for dinner.  Does Landon really care for Jamie, or is he just being nice to her because he feels sorry for her?  When Landon finds out, later, that Jamie is terminally ill, he asks her the biggest question ever that will change the rest of their lives, and shows whether or not Landon really loves Jamie.   <br /> <br /> I really loved the whole book.  It was just great, and it showed you how much Landon really did care for Jamie in the end.  The only thing that I didn't like about the book was the ending.  The end was sad, and I don't think that Jamie or Landon should have had to go through that.  Even though the ending was sad, it made the book a whole lot better. <br /> <br /> I know that I loved this book, and I think that many other girls would enjoy it too.  Not only girls, but also adults would like it.  It's an awesome story, and I'll probably read it again myself. <br />
0451147960|2.0|I have not read much of Follett's work but I hope the rest is better than this. It must be, as Follett has sold more than 50 million books. On his website he admits that this early work, written under a pseudonyme and then re-released after he had developed a following, is not very good. In the introduction, he indicates that he had not really developed his successful style at this point, and that his aim (something to do with an evaluation of pre-destiny) exceeded his reach here.  <br /> <br />Actually the story line has a nugget of a well-developed caper to it, but the characters are hopeless. They suddenly appear, get a minor character development, do something inane or out of character and then disappear. At least in a Seinfeld episode, everyone's story line gets tied out as the credits role.  <br /> <br />The gist of this thing is there are several competing groups seeking a lost masterpiece by the Italian 20th century painter Modigliani. This painter caroused and drank to excess, died poor and unappreciated, then became a star posthumously mostly due to the interest and purchases of the eccentric Albert Barnes of Philadelphia. Our story line here is that Modigliani painted while drunk or under the influence of drugs, and one of those paintings was not destroyed by the artist but has disappeared from the art world.  <br /> <br />Consider our loopy collection of characters next. Problem number one is that none of them is the protaganist or even the central character. They just appear and disappear as if in an Ionesco play.  <br /> <br />Follett gives us a young British girl living in Paris. She takes off after the lost painting, spending the first several days looking in Catholic churches, before remembering that Modigliani was Jewish. You would think someone with a degree in art history who had studied Modigliani extensively would know that, as it was an essential fact in his relationship with the Paris art world.   <br /> <br />Next we have a movie star, who frets over her inability to change the world, especially to wipe out poverty. She then meets a rogue at a cocktail party, instantly moves in with him, discovers he has quite a past, becomes addicted to speed, and decides to steal an art collection valued at $1 MM.  <br /> <br />How about the art gallery owner who is impotent until he sees his wife cheating on him with multiple simultaneous partners? I dont know how that advances the story. It is almost like Follett had a few characters left over from another book that he wanted to use up before they reached their sell by date.   <br /> <br />Then there is the painter, who gets run out of the cliquish London art world because he caused a scene at a cocktail party and his paintings sell for more than they are worth. So he turns to forgery, to make the point that the system is rigged against the living painter who needs to pay the mortgage.    <br /> <br />Finally, we have a group of 10 top London art dealers who buy 10 forgeries in one day. Incompetence seems to know no boundaries here. <br /> <br />
B000BM6AVA|2.0|This album along with mezmerize was the biggest dissapointment!  Serj needs to sing and daron needs to stick to guitar and back up vocals.  I hate to say this but I think there best has come and gone.  Daron's voice sounds awful and if he sang as much back in self titled and toxicity they would not be as big as they are now.  Horrible and they got two stars just because I love there old stuff so much.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Any reviews written that do nothing but shred Madonna have been put in place by \\"TeamLamb\\"- a bunch of Mariah Carey fans who are out to down Madonna at any cost. Here's the proof- taken directly off an MC fansite:----    Lets Help Madonna's Album Flop!!    Welcome to TeamLamb, an organized team of Maria Carey fans. Our purpose is to keep Mariah, the biggest female musical icon of all time, on top.    Unfortunately, the no-talent slut, Madonna, is still being referred to as the \\"Queen of Pop,\\" even though her most recent album, American Life, and her Reinvention Tour have really made her the \\"Queen of Flops.\\" Madonna used to be successful, but that's because she slept her way to the top. Mariah, on the other hand, has sold millions of records based solely on her amazing talents and being a great role model.    Mariah has had sixteen number one singles. Her last two number one singles, \\"We Belong Together\\" and \\"Heartbreaker\\" have broken worldwide records everywhere. Mariah's most recent Charmbracelet tour was a critically acclaimed smash that played to millions all over the world. Roger Friedman, a well respected music journalist, called the concert one of the greatest he's seen in the past ten years. Mariah is, indeed, the biggest musical sensation since the Beatles.    Within the next couple months, Madonna will try to take away Mariah's crown by releasing \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" along with the single, \\"Hung Up.\\" There seems to be a lot of buzz , but most of it seems generated by Madonna's desperate, pathetic fans. TeamLamb will do everything we can to make this project a flop for Madonna. We will organize by calling radio stations and telling them how much we don't like her new songs, write letters to several magazines and confirm that she is, indeed, over, and spread negative messages about Madonna on several Internet blogs.    [...]  So please- all fans and interested parties in this CD- make your own decision. I own the CD and think it's fabulous, but that's for your to decide on your own. :)    Have a good day!
B000BC8TBE|5.0|I am very happy at the thought that Mariah has revamped two entire albums now. First was her Current album with the extra tracks that she included. Now her Christmas album also got a fact lift from it's usual release. She has worked so hard to get her fans (us that is) and everyone else to hear her music. <br />Her Christmas album sounds very soulful and is indeed an accomplishment in it's own sense. Very nice and festive to listen to. With the extra track added in now, it give more length to the album as well. It's music to anyone out there complaining. So whether you like it or not it's music still. But compared to most young artists today. Very few can match her. Her creativity too is reflected in this album as well. Along with some Christmas classics performed and new ones. Give this Holiday CD a spin and you'll see what I am talking about... Happy Listening guys!!!!
B000BO0LLS|5.0|Yup! I am happy about this album and in fact it's what she needed for a long time since her disaster on Glitter. I am just wondering because this album would've sound great if the company would have also included the two songs that were not included on her original album and only on the singles format. Like the Japanese version which has 16 tracks out of which had \\"Sprung\\" & \\"Secret Love\\" both very admirable tracks and are very enjoyable to listen to. If the company did that then this album would be a good buy to anyone! Don't get me wrong this album is good and is raved about nowdays. But it could've been better if she had those unreleased songs on as well, right? I've listened to both tracks that's how I know.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|I must admit I am \\"hung up\\" on Madonna's new single, but from what I heard of the rest of the album, it's a bit too reminiscent of another once-popular dance act, Erasure. I thought \\"Music\\" was her return-to-dance-music album, and I think she did that one with more originality. This new one just seems to borrow a little too much from what has already been done. Still, catchy stuff. Nothing less for Madonna.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Well, what is there left to say about this CD?<br /><br />I'll start at the beginning.<br /><br />I went directly to the store to purchase this CD when it came out.  I was so excited to listen when I got in my car, (as always when I purchase a CD).  I put it in and immedietly was greated by \\"Hung Up\\".  This song really made me want the whole album.  I was hooked from the beginning!<br /><br />Another great thing about the CD, (besides the music), is that the songs don't have endings or really beginnings...they all mesh together.  It creates the perfect dance CD!  I love to have something to listen to while I'm working out, and this is perfect!  The songs are really up-beat and fun to listen to.  I love driving with the radio blasting this music.  The beat is thumping in my ears and the wind is blowing through my hair.  This is what good music is all about...being able to enjoy it.<br /><br />Madonna knows how to turn up the heat with this album, and I praise her for it.  \\"How High\\" is one of my faves, and I can't wait to listen to it on my way home from work today.<br /><br />Madonna mixes sultry beats with funky rhythms that create a dance mood inside of you.  When you hear this music, the least you can do is bob your head.  It makes me want to jump up and do some dancing!<br /><br />I love Madonna and always have, and if you haven't heard the CD, then please don't leave a review.  You can't base your opinion of a certain CD on how you feel about the artist.  Your views are already tainted.<br /><br />Go out and buy it if you are looking for a fun CD that will get you moving, or if you are wanting some funky background music for a get-together.
0553212478|5.0|This book is truly worthy of the term \\"classic\\".  Mary Shelley began writing this novel at the young age of 18, yet managed to create a landmark work of fiction.

0345403959|5.0|I have the belgariad and mallorean series as well as the companion volumes and the rivan codex.  I just finished this book for the third time and it's still funny.  This book is the past 7000 years as seen through belgarath's eyes it offers a great deal of fleshing out characters such as Aldur, Cherek, Torak, Beldin, The twins, Polgara, Poledra, Belar, the salmirrissas, and a whole host of characters.  If you liked this book you should trying reading Polgara the sorceress.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|Wow... I'm impressed.  I really could care less for most anything heard on the radio or MTV these days, but these guys are a rare exception.  Between this and Mezmerize I think this double album ranks with some of the classics, even up there with Pink Floyd's The Wall and Genesis' Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, and as far as metal goes, Queensryche's Operation Mindcrime.  Everything is there: a sincere and creative musical vision, catchy, memorable tunes that are also hard hitting and unique, not afraid to experiment and take chances, yet without a lot of the contrivances that the more \\"progressive\\" bands can sometimes fall into.  I may not be able to connect with the heavy-handed lyrical approach at times but I can't deny the sincerity of their approach. They have the range to go from punch-in-the-face aggression to moments of striking subtlety and beauty, as well as elements of crazy humor. Fantastic performances, just a lot of fun to listen to.
0385507755|3.0|One reviewer writes that Mr. Frey is a \\"spoiled rich kid\\" who lets Mommy and Daddy foot the bill for his rehab, and that is more true than most of what's in the book.  I never felt sorry for Mr. Frey (except when he was ripping off his toenails, and that made me a little squeamish), and in fact was a little angry at his self-serving attitude.  I felt like he portrayed himself as this hero figure who made such a positive impression on the poor down-trodden souls who happened to stumble into his \\"light.\\"  The only thing about Mr. Frey that impressed me was his unwillingness to assign blame to anyone but himself for his addiction, and for that I applaud him.  I hope other people will read this \\"dramatization\\" and realize that the only real message lies in the fact that HE made himself an addict, that HE chose that lifestyle, and that only HE could make himself better.  It's true for addicts of all kinds, including smokers, shoppers, and overeaters - the only one who can change one's life is self.
0553801503|1.0|My fundamental critique: Unlike the 1st three novels, all the characters now sound alike--they're all cunning, plotting, scheming. In his effort to advance the bifurcated but converging story line, and with the overabundance of new characters to assimilate/introduce, Martin lost hold of character development. The result? Reading quickly became a chore. Like another reviewer, I couldn't even attempt the teaser chapter for the next installment.
0446577383|1.0|It's too bad this very clever writer had to spoil the story by saturating it with his anti-America viewpoint, especially on pgs.308 thru 311.  Having read every one of his books, I expected to enjoy The Camel Club as much as the others but instead it made me angry and very disappointed.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Finally, a CD that will rejuvenate the dance floor. Instead of re-mixes of pop hits or beat-driven remakes of '80s ballads, we finally have a ready-made dance floor sensation.   <br /> <br />Madonna pulls out ALL the stops on \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor.\\"  I was addicted to \\"Hung Up\\" since the very first time I heard it - but I also thought, a singer would have to really make a concerted effort to mess up sampling an ABBA song (who were so far ahead of their time I think they were aliens sent to earth to help us forget our '70s miseries, if there were any - I wasn't really around then). I was skeptical about the rest of the album - how could it possibly live up to the first single? I was awesomely surprised when I finally heard the whole CD. Usually there are at least a couple of \\"skip-overs\\" on any CD, but not this one - each song blends effortlessly into the other. Favorites? They're all my favorites.     <br /> <br />The CD has high-pitched energy, intensity, depth of emotion, & sense of fun that has been lacking in clubs (and on radio) since at least the early '90s (think \\"Too Funky\\" by G. Michael, Black Box, C&C Music Factory).  Well, Madonna has delivered the first truly great dance CD of the millennium.  Into the third decade of her career, Madonna is still breaking new ground, exploring new territory, & getting there first. <br />
B000B8QEYC|4.0|People whine about \\"more of the same\\" from Enya. What do you want, for her to breakout into a rap? Come on. For nearly two decades, this is what she's been doing: putting out beautiful new age songs. Her soothing voice takes you away to be lost in the deep layers of her creations. If you like her past music, you'll love \\"Amarantine.\\" Its pretty simple. With all the crap out there, its nice to hear something so beautiful.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This album is just beautiful. Each song tells a story and takes me to away to a fairy tale land. The grandiose music and layered instruments blend together to create a magical delightful atmostphere that takes my breath away just listening to it.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Ok, I admit I've been a huge Madonna fan from the beginning (and yes, I loved AMERICAN LIFE).  However, CONFESSIONS wowed even me.  This is among her best discs, up there with MUSIC, RAY OF LIGHT and EROTICA.  An hour of pure dance bliss.  Buy it--you'll be glad you did.  A solid \\"10\\"!
B000BNTM96|5.0|Last week I had the great pleasure of seeing Queens as the opening act for Nine Inch Nails. Their combination of mindblowing energy and musicianship made this truly one of the best gigs I have ever been to (I enjoyed Nine Inch Nails as well) <br /> <br />Simply put, if you're a serious Queens fan this CD/ DVD is essential.  <br /> <br />Excellent sound quality on the audio CD- I especially loved the extended versions of You Can't Quit Me Baby (one of my all time favourite Queens songs), No One Knows, Song for the Dead and Long Slow Goodbye. Josh Homme is in great voice and the band is super tight throughout.  <br /> <br />The DVD is also very enjoyable just to see a band totally engrossed in their own world and music. Excellent and very varied setlist- you get to hear a lot of older Queens material as well as rare tracks such as the mellow I Wanna Make It Wit Chu from the Desert Sessions and Fun Machine, a lost track from the wonderful Lullabies to Paralyze. Cool bonus features with guests and former band members such as Dave Grohl, Nick Oliveri and Mark Lanegan, but the picture and sound quality varies quite a lot. Heads up on another cool feature: you get a commentary if you change the audio setup to French. If you're expecting theatrics and pyrotechnics you've come to the wrong place, for Queens it's really all about the music.  <br /> <br />And one last warning for all the **** smokers out there, better pick a different show to heckle at next time ;).
B000BUYP4Q|4.0|Batman Begins (Christopher Nolan, 2005)<br /><br />Nolan finally shows us that Memento wasn't a fluke with Batman Begins. Completely ignoring the film-series mythos, he starts from scratch again, giving us the story of Bruce Wayne (The Machinist's Christian Bale, giving his second fantastic performance in two years) in the years leading up to his becoming Batman, as well as the first months of his superhero status.<br /><br />While Bale's performance is quite good, there's no way he could have pulled this off by himself. Nolan and co. surrounded him with an excellent supporting cast, including Liam Neeson, Michael Caine (who takes over the Alfred role more than capably), Gary Oldman, Katie Holmes (whose career, save the amusing Pieces of April, had taken a decidedly ugly turn before this), Rutger Hauer, Morgan Freeman, and more (it would, in fact, be possible to spend an entire thousand-word review just naming, much less extolling the virtues of, the cast).<br /><br />Nolan seems to have (thankfully) thrown away everything he learned in his completely unnecessary remake of Insomnia and decided to direct another Memento. Good thing, too; the dark, claustrophobic atmosphere of Memento is tailor-made for a Batman story. He's got a bigger budget this time, though; Nolan's Gotham is perhaps the best-realized alternate city since Ridley Scott made Bladerunner more than two decades ago now. Nolan, like Scott before him, shows that it's possible to have a whole city as your landscape and still make a movie that's almost painfully intimate.<br /><br />About the only real flaw in it is that Bruce Wayne's character isn't nearly as fatally flawed as either his comic-book incarnation (at least, the comic-book incarnation we've had for the past twenty years or so) or as he was in the earlier films. However, if Nolan continues the series, and the movie's final scene certainly sets the stage for that, then he'll certainly have ample opportunity to more fully explore Wayne's character.<br /><br />The best Batman film to date by a wide margin. It's good to see Nolan's found his chops again. ****character. <br /> <br />The best Batman film to date by a wide margin. It's good to see Nolan's found his chops again. ****
078401213X|5.0|Pi,shot on a tiny budget on 16mm is a great indie movie. <br /> <br />Very believable, paranoid delusional trip of a character going crazy to solve the riddle of 3.124 (pi) - great central performance! <br /> <br />The director has gone on to make the more polished and better cast movie, Requiem for a Dream but I think this one is way way better because its more grittier, raw and honest.  <br /> <br />The ants crawling out of a computer, creeps me out all the time! <br /> <br />This is what indie film is about, check it out. <br /> <br />Recommended.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I didn't see the TV series (Fox, space western? No way), and don't like Buffy/Angel (also by Whedon), so I saw this thing without any preconceptions.  It was funny in parts, obviously made for less than Revenge of the Sith, had great characters, and left you wanting more.  Better than Star Wars or Star Trek movies.  After seeing the movie, I bought the Firefly series; it is a real pity this series didn't stay on TV and things like Stargate and Star Trek did.  Down side: a little too gruesome for my kid to see, a Buffy-like 90-pound girl vs. monsters situation, a space hooker, and planets in the future that look like the desert near LA.  But the movie works.
B00005YU1O|4.0|This movie is vitamins for the mind. there is so much discussion on the animation, but to be honest for me the animation was secondary, the content and the Linklaters writing and direction of all the philosophical conversations I found to be riveting. <br /> <br />Mind you, not everyone likes this stuff...many of my friends think its too heavy, pretentious, or what not but everyone for themselves - this is one of my favourite movies and DVD is just great. <br /> <br />Unique and stylish for people who want to think about their movies afterwards! <br /> <br />Recommended!
B000AADYRQ|3.0|okay, i'll be completely honest. i've loved death cab for years and years, and to my dismay, plans was a complete let down. yes, it has pretty songs, and nice lyrics, but to many \\"long-time\\" death cab fans, the cd just doesn't hit as hard. which isn't because they \\"sold out.\\" songs such as \\"marching bands of manhattan\\" bring back the nostaligic feeling that death cab has always given me, but the repetitive slow songs and depressing lyrics on this album just become monotanous. good, but upsetting.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Robert Rodriguez hits form again! <br /> <br />Pleasantly suprised and what a great DVD. <br /> <br />Love the style, down and dirty characters, this brings neo-noir <br />right up to date. <br /> <br />Sin city is a cool place to visit, but be prepared it's dark, violent and very nasty - but hey thats why we all love it! <br /> <br />recommended DVD!
0307276902|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. I could not put it down, and i am the type of person who usually doesn't like reading. It is very inspiring how strong he is and how he overcame all this adversity. I'm suprised he's still alive, and I'm glad he is to tell his story. By far the best book out there. He is a very talented writer. I read his second book all in one day and I can't wait for him to come out with more books.
0553801503|2.0|In anticipation of Feast, I reread the first three books.  I've done this for each new book and have come to realize just how wonderful a writer GRRM is.  His narratives are rich and detailed, his character development is insightful, his story lines are compelling.  He is able to write a humorous exchange and a decent sex scene.  Each of the first three books would keep me up late or take me away from work.  I can't overstate how much I enjoy reading them. <br /> <br />This book represents the worst writing that GRRM has ever done.  The rich narrative of the first three books is almost completely gone.  Many descriptions are limited to a single sentence and most chapters lack anything resembling narrative. What lenghty narrative we do get is pale and thin.   <br /> <br />There is too much dialog and not enough characterization.  In the first three books, GRRM would tell us what the characters felt, thought, dreamed, feared.  The banter in Feast is okay, but not on the same level as in previous books.  GRRM would often surprise us with dialog - in Feast the dialog is always predictable. <br /> <br />The story line in Feast has suffered badly from the way one book was broken into two.  The plot just isn't compelling.  This is a book I could put down and often did.  Reading it was a chore, not a joy.  Or at least not the joy I have come to expect from GRRM.  The inital book should have just been cleaved in half with all the characters in both. <br /> <br />However, under no circumstances am I giving up on A Song of Ice and Fire.  I have no doubt GRRM will return to form.  He is an outstanding writer and this is an outstanding series.  When is A Dance with Dragons coming out??
B0007GAERG|1.0|Come on, Madge fans. All say it with me: M-A-D-O-N-N-A! Mariah is just a cash-in. Oh, and to my point about Madonna being the most successful selling female artist of all-time - JUST CHECK IN THE GUINESS HIT SINGLES AND ALBUMS!
B000BM6AVA|4.0|This album doesn't compare with Mesmerize. On Mesmerize it was track after track of fresh sound and lyric. This one....eh, not so much.  <br /> <br />Serj still has that melancholy voice, which draws you to what he has to say. Unfortunately, he doesn't have much to say. As the lyrics are not clear at all and the songs seem incoherent. <br /> <br />But, a few good songs for sure <br />Stealing Society 8/10 <br />Attack  7/10 <br />Hypnotize  7/10 <br />Soldier's Side 8/10 <br />Holly Mountains 7/10 <br /> <br />They could have easily put these songs on the first album and had a classic (they still do imo) but no, they got greedy as most bands do when they produce a whole bunch of tracks. <br /> <br />I'm a Soad fan, but I wouldn't buy this album it's more of BFFAB (borrow from friend and burn) nothing to brag about.

B0006B2A42|5.0|A team of American marines and naval personnel aboard a nuclear submarine are ordered to a tiny observation camp on the ice near the North Pole. The Americans have been receiving distress signals from the camp but cannot reach anyone by radio. What at first appears to be a simple rescue mission changes dramatically when the sub picks up a British secret agent and a Russian double-agent as passengers. The nuclear submarine races to the camp when the true mission is disclosed and word reaches them that the Soviets are also heading to the pole by jet to recover a spy satellite.<br /><br />The cast is awesome and their acting really stands the test of time. Rock Hudson is superb as the mission's leader Submarine Commander Ferraday; Patrick McGoohan is excellent as the evasive and secretive British secret agent; Jim Brown is outstanding as the tough American Marine Captain; and even Ernest Borgnine is believable as oddball Russian expatriate Boris Vaslov (although I kept thinking of him driving a cab for Snake Plisken). Director John Sturges had the technical language of the crew aboard the sub carefully screened for accuracy to increase the sense of reality in the film. Although the special effects were cutting edge for 1968, they may seem a bit fake to current audiences. And for trivia buffs -- Ice Station Zebra was the favorite movie of billionaire Howard Hughes, who would watched it fanatically in his Desert Inn hotel room.<br /><br />I recommend this movie for a couple of reasons. First, it is a well done film with top shelf acting and character development. The plot is great and you won't be disappointed by the ending. Second, this is an excellent example of the workings of espionage during the Cold War years. It's a good movie to show the younger generation when they ask questions about the Cold War. But honestly, it's a great suspense movie with spies, traitors, jets,  paratroopers and a nuke sub.

B00000IFWE|5.0|You know how you put a variety of stuff on your iPOD, or you make a mix CD or tape (yes, some of us still make tapes) so that you can pop it in while you're driving and have the perfect radio station? The \\"starter\\" is the big thing; you have to start the mix with just the right song. All the songs are important, obviously, but \\"starters\\" set the mood. Whether it's a jam-out mix or a chill-out, 'mood' mix, it has to be just the right song by just the right artist. <br /> <br />Some of my favorite artists don't have any \\"starters.\\" They have a lot of songs I like, but none I'd kick off a driving mix with. Tom Petty has whole albums of \\"starters.\\" When his new stuff comes out I don't think, I just buy. And then I know it's time to make a new driving mix, cuz I've got a whole bunch of new \\"starters.\\" Whatever your mood is, if rock `n' roll can set that mood, then this guy's got the perfect song. Apply this review to any one of his albums; I attach it to \\"Echo\\" just because I think it's underrated, but it really doesn't matter. If you like any one of `em, just buy `em all.

0553801503|3.0|I like many others waited for 5 years to read this book.  I am sad to say that I checked GRRM's website nearly every day to see when it would be published.  The book is competently written but just not outstanding in the way that his earlier books were.  I managed to limit myself to a chapter or 2 a day, which I could never had done with the earlier books, with those I was reading almost constantly with brief naps when I couldn't keep my eyes open any longer. <br /> <br />I read with interest another review which stated that Cersei received 22.5% of the pages, and Jaime nearly that much.  When there are characters like Arya and Sansa (although Littlefinger's machinations are probably the best bits of her chapters) it seemed a terrible waste to focus on Cersei and Jaime who really didn't seem to develop at all in this book.  One or two chapters to show how crazy and incompetent Cersei really is would have been plenty. <br /> <br />Given the terrible reviews this book has received (comparative to the glowing reviews received by the earlier books) I would be interested to see whether GRRM responds in any way with some type of explanation.  The most obvious would seem to be lack of focus and motivation with this instalment, but perhaps I am simply missing the bigger picture. <br /> <br />I look forward to reading a Dance with Dragons and hope that it will be a substantial improvement on Feast.  Otherwise, I think this will be yet another series I have to give up on. <br /> <br />
1400031087|5.0|This book is intense and holds no bars.  It allowed a different perspective on drug addiction and made me see things in a more forgiving manner.  I especially enjoyed watching his relationships change over time with his family, therapists, and even himself.  An incredible process that the reader experiences along with the author.
0060174900|5.0|I was inspired to write this review by the number of people who had negative things to say about this book. Maybe it's more of a girl thing or maybe you have to have experienced a little bit of depression on your life. This is one of my favorite books and I think that the imagery is beautiful and fully worthy of a poet. Considering this book is written in the first person it would be unrealistic for Esther to comment on herself. Readers are supposed to understand her character based on the way she sees the world. This is a certain style of writing that not everyone will enjoy, but it was very much in fashion in this time period. Showing, not telling, as many english teachers put it. <br /> <br />As far as Esther not accepting help, well what help was offered? Her mother's urging to become a secretary? It doesn't seem unrealistic that an educated young woman would want something more and yet not know to get it, particuarly in this time period. For example my own mother grew up in the same era and has told me that the only obvious career paths for an educated woman were a teacher or a nurse. My mother obtained a masters degree in english, but was not encouraged to pursue a PHd or any career other than a teacher. This book is about a woman who wants something more, but isn't sure what that is, in a society that does not offer many options. That is the key to understanding this book and the reason that it might be difficult to understand through the lens of modern times. <br /> <br />The thing that I find the most saddening about this book is that after Ms. Plath made a recovery from an earlier episode of depression, presumably like the one in this book, she went on to experience another episode that resulted in her suicide. Esther makes such an inspiring recovery that it is very sad to realize what happens to Ms. Plath.
0743454537|3.0|I found this book fascinating until the ending.  The ending did not explore how a family would go forward after experiencing the events that they did.  I thought the author sold the story short by not going there.
B000BO0LKY|5.0|Love Mariah Carey! Oh yeah, for all you idiots Madonna's music is entirely different from Mariah's, so to compare the two is just stupid and it makes no sense. If you hate Mariah, get off this page.  <br /> <br />P.S. Hating ain't healty, but it makes people like Mariah more successful in everything that they do because haters are motivators!

B000AND8CY|5.0|After an exceptional debut with the album \\"Enter\\", many fans felt a little bit dissapointed with \\"Mother Earth\\", a very operistic piece compared with brutal songs like Deep Within (from Enter). Overall, Mother Earth is not a bad album, but too different from the first one. Silent Force is, in some way, a coming back to their roots, with nice vocals but also with the taste of real metal. In this release (imported from the UK) are included a couple of bonus tracks (Destroyed & Jane Doe) and a DVD with four songs from a Germany concert. The production of the DVD was remarkable: high quality video and superb audio. A videoclip (Stand my Ground) is also included, and seems there was enough budget because is really well done. Before ordering it, make sure your DVD player can handle the PAL format, otherwise you won't be able to watch it.
B000BM6AVA|3.0|This album in my opinion is probably their weakest.  Toxicity is their best album followed by Mesmerize and then their first... <br />This album sounds like they wrote a bunch of songs, put out their best songs on Mesmerize and then put the next 12 best that were left over on Hypnotize.  The best song on this one would be a weak song on Mesmerize.  My friends who are SOAD fans agree with this review.
0767834739|5.0|I loved this movie more than the first one..the casting was very good especially Sieena Guillory (very very hot) Adding the new charectors valentine and olivera was a good choice however i would of liked to see  chris redfield since hes in the first game. plus the nemesis was an awesome boss but i think he was portrayed as a pansy in the end though. but with that aside a good film leaving an opening for the next chapter in the series.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|It is no coincidence that this CD was released on November 22nd., which is associated with St. Cecilia's Day.  In John Dryden's Ode to St. Cecilia, he portays St. Cecilia as having a voice so pure that when an angel heard it, he appeared before her, mistaking earth for heaven.  This is the best way to describe this Enya CD.  I recommend this CD to anyone who wants to be uplifted to the sounds of heaven in these troublesome times!

B00003CXI1|5.0|I remeber going to see this movie not too long after it came out in theaters in 2001. I was never one who really got into Harry Potter, I've only read the first two books, but this movie is fantastic. I couldn't believe how well director Chris Columbus (Home Alone) did on making this exactly like the book. <br /> <br />Harry Potter is an 11 year old boy. His parents dies young, suppossedly in a car crash, when Harry was only a baby. His only living relatives were his stuck up Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, who had been fueding with Harry's parents for years. Naturally, Harry is treated like crap for his entire time there, always playing second banana to his fat, spoiled cousin Dudley. But one day, Harry gets a letter, the first ever in his life. As he is about to open it, his Uncle snatches it away from him, and his face goes white. He immediately tears it to bits. But, over the next week, Harry would get hundreds more of those letters. So many, that Uncle Vernon flips his lid and moves the family out to an island in a hut in the middle of a deserted lake area. But that night, a giant man shows up and breaks into the house. Everyone terrified, his first words were a friendly \\"Happy birthday Harry!\\" It was Hagrid, caretaker at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He tells Harry then, what his Aunt and Uncle had kept from him for so long. He is a wizard. What follows is a fantastic adventure at a British school of magic that the whole family will enjoy. <br /> <br />4.5/5 stars.
0141301074|5.0|Mr. Twit and Mrs. Twits are a couple who fight with each other. Like when Mr. twit put mrs. twit in the balloon. and then there comes the animals, they use superglue and catch birds and cook them for Birdpies. Then the animals fight back. Their revenge is surprisingly funny. I can't spoil you the ending!
B000BM6AVA|5.0|When I first listened to Hypnotize, I wasn't really paying much attention, and it ended sooner than expected. But, as I kept listening to it over and over again, I grew into the songs. The songs have a variation of melodies, ranging from fast tempos to soothing softness, even if some lyrics did get a little repetitive. The ending song, \\"Soldier Side\\" is a nice continuation of Mesmerize's first song. Also, I noticed that the end of \\"Lonely Day\\" (which has an amazing guitar solo) is the same as \\"Soldier Side - Intro\\". My favorite tracks were \\"Lonely Day\\", \\"U-Fig\\", and \\"Soldier Side\\".  <br /> <br />People are saying to me that Mesmerize was better. Well, thats an unfair comparison, since Mesmerize and Hypnotize are complementary parts for each other and together they are one (symbolized by the artwork trick), so you really can't judge a half of something. Overall, this is a great album and I would definately get it. <br /> <br />Attack - 8/10 (Very nice fast paced song, with interesting pauses for verses.) <br /> <br />Dreaming - 8/10 (A good song, kind of hard to get into at first.) <br /> <br />Kill Rock 'N Roll - 9/10 (Very good song, with some nice vocals from Serj and Daron during the chorus.) <br /> <br />Hypnotize - 9/10 (The first single from this album. Switches from a soft quiet tone to a loud energetic mix of pure energy.) <br /> <br />Stealing Society - 8.5/10 (Very intriguing song, mixing fast pace music and scattering lyrics. The part where Daron sings about drugs sounds a lot like the Dead Kennedys.) <br /> <br />Tentative - 8/10 (An intermediately paced anti-war song, with lyrics such as \\"Where do you Expect us to go when the bombs fall?\\", has some switching rhythms which add positively to the song.) <br /> <br />U-Fig - 9.5/10 (One of my favorites, Serj does an awesome job with the verse, and the pounding voices of Serj and Daron singing the lines of the chorus really drills this song home.) <br /> <br />Holy Mountains - 9/10 (Any SOAD fan knows the band is Armenian, this has references to the Armenian Genocide in this, very similar to P.L.U.C.K.) <br /> <br />Vicinity of Obscenity - 9.5/10 (On the album Mesmerize, the song \\"This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song\\" talks about not eating the fish. Well here's one about Banana Terracotta pie. Vocals are extraordinary in this one.) <br /> <br />She's Like Heroin - 8.5/10 (\\"Selling ass for heroin\\", an interesting song, hard for me to get into but it still sounds pretty good.) <br /> <br />Lonely Day - 10/10 (One of the best System songs up to date. Daron sings the verses with such a sincerity it'll make your heart sink. And Serj joins in during the chorus making the song a rollercoaster ride of sound. Daron has an exceptionally great guitar solo here. Notice the very last 7 seconds of the song, sound familiar?) <br /> <br />Soldier Side - 10/10 (The continuation of \\"Soldier Side - Intro\\" on Mesmerize. This is a very slow paced song, describing a soldier realizing he's never going home. Great vocals, great instrumentals, great everything.) <br /> <br />
B000002LQR|5.0|Great album, brings back great memories of the summer of 1992.Last Peppers album with their kick a** attitude.
B0000AZJXQ|2.0|Mer De Noms is probably one of my favourite albums, so I definitely wasn't keen on the next album being a let-down.  Unfortunately, that's exactly what it was.  As other reviewers have said: don't get me wrong, I wanted to like it and I'm not intent on bashing it or those who enjoy it. <br /> <br />It's just in context of the album that came before it...something has changed.  The whole vibe of this band has gone a bit out of whack, the style has shifted, and in my view not in a positive 'oh what a nice suprise' way.  It is painfully obvious that Maynard really started exerting his ego and force in the band on Thirteenth step, and as such the layered, lush and melodic pop beauty of Mer De Noms seems to have disappeared to a large degree with the exception of a few tracks. <br /> <br />Now, to backtrack slightly, the first thing that made Mer De Noms so great was that it wasn't trying to be as deep as Tool, it wasn't as progressive, weird or drawn out, and that a traditional sense of melody was used that highlighted Maynard's brilliant abilities at belting out truly touching and emotional vocals.   <br /> <br />Well, that's all changed.  The songs are now too long for their own good (hey long songs are good but they aren't working for such boring, repetitive compositions), the melodies are bland, muted...maybe even held in check, for somewhat faded and droll singing.   <br /> <br />'The Package' starts things off in a very...well, faceless way.  Some praise it as a masterpiece, I'm usually waiting for it to go somewhere, but it hobbles along with very understated yet uninteresting melodies.  The distorted section is just annoying on account of the weakness of the riff.  You can just see the smug smirk on Maynard's face when he says 'Clever got me this far, tricky got me in'.  Sorry man but Kurt Cobain did it way better with 'Teenage angst has served us well, now I'm bald and old'. <br /> <br />'Weak And Powerless' - the 'single'.  My oh my, if the rest of the album had been more like this I would have totally gone nuts over this album.  This sounds like APC again, with compelling lyrics, and fantastic singing to an endearing vocal melody.  It was fitting this was the single because upon first hearing it I was desperate to get the album, only to find it a let-down as a whole. <br /> <br />'The Noose' lets things slide back down again.  It is slow and slightly ambient, but Maynard seems afraid to sound out or something, kind of phoning in a performance, and the track never goes much of anywhere, despite getting louder towards the end. <br /> <br />'Blue' actually has some guitar, which is welcome, and an interesting little riff.  It actually feels like it makes some progression as it goes along and is a better track.  'Vanishing' appears to be 'ambient rock' and is the worse for it, not making much of an impression on the listener.  I guess it is nice in a relaxed way.  'A Stranger' is a nice acoustic number with potential but suffers from having a forgettable vocal line.  Maynard seems stretched for new vocal ideas. <br /> <br />'The Outsider' has poor metal ideas that a rock-based band like this simply can't pull off (unless the song-writing is exceptional).  The chugging just isn't working for me, I've heard it so much better and so much more appropriately in so many other places.  This track is totally unassuming.  It's either got something I can't see in it or is just bad, I'm not sure.   <br /> <br />'Crimes'.  Skip this track. <br /> <br />'The Nurse Who Loved Me'.  This sounds like it could have been good...digging the mellotron sounds.  Unfortunately it's boring, but ok I guess. <br /> <br />'Pet'.  Finalllyyy...a track that is memorable!  Although the metal elements are once again weak and forced, Maynard finally adds in some memorable lyrics and memorable vocals.  The whole rhythm of the war drum thing is great, and when he says 'stayyy with me' it feels like he's thinking about vocal melody for once (on this album).I really quite like this track, it's my favourite after 'Weak And Powerless'.   <br /> <br />'Lullaby'...UGH!  Skip! <br /> <br />'Gravity'.  Simply more of the same.  No more no less. <br /> <br />I've seen the phrase 'Tool-lite' be thrown around in regards to this album. I know APC fans will bristle at the thought, but I am forced to agree.  Maynard let his Tool excesses spill over into A Perfect Circle, and quite frankly it put a damper on their personality.  Seems like he's pulled down the others into his progressive excesses while forgetting the lush pop-beauty of the previous album.  That's sad, because I'd love to hear Maynard sing something on the level of 'Orestes' or '3 Libras' again and not waste all this time attempting to be obscure.  Leave that for Tool, an awesome band that was once challenged in quality by a band called APC with a little release called 'Mer De Noms'.  That band appears to have faded.  Also, avoid 'Emotive'.  It's an abomination.
B000AGTPUA|5.0|My son has been waiting patiently for this dvd to be released, so last night we held a \\"Polar Express\\" party with everyone in their P.J.'s and plenty of hot chocolate...The children and the adults loved it.  We had the surround sound on and the train felt like it was coming straight through the living room. My husband said it was the best sounding movie he had ever heard..WE love it-the book, the movie, the Josh Groban song, Tom Hanks everything! It will make you really get into the spirit! I know it is a new classic! Merry Christmas!
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna's much criticized and maligned \\"American Life\\" is truly one of those albums where its bad press swallowed up a fantastic album.  The \\"Shocking\\" video for the album track and first single wasnt the best launching ground. Madonna throwing bombs, mocking the president and being anti-war in the video (which she elected to not show at last minute) helped fuel a negative media campaign and bury the project which is a shame. PAssed all the hype is  a really beautiful electro folk styled album complete with personal lyrics and strong songwriting. \\"American Life\\" isnt MAdonna's most axccessible album but it is arguably her best one.<br /><br />Standout Tracks: X-static Process, Nothing Fails, Love Profusion<br /><br />Weaker Moments: American Life, I'm so stupid

B000BKDOCA|4.0|Though Jive Records kind of kept this album under covers, fans have been anticipating it's release since the article billboard.com posted. Me, not being a huge fan of remixes was slightly hesitant to get this, considering I usually think remixes butcher a good song. Well that's not 100% true in this case.<br /><br />The album starts off with a remix of \\"Toxic\\", the biggest hit from her last album 'In the Zone'. It's not one that I really think is spectacular by any means, but it's not horrendous like some I've heard before. The best remixes on this album are \\"Me Against the Music\\" JUSTICE Remix, \\"Touch of My Hand\\" Bill Hamel Remix, \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" Dave Aude Slave Driver Mix, and the extremely slick \\"Early Mornin'\\" Jason Nevins Remix. (That was one of my least favorite songs from 'In the Zone', but I like this version). The key track on 'B in the Mix' is of course the brand new song \\"And Then We Kiss\\" Junkie XL Remix. It has a dance-y vibe while it still has the potential to be a radio hit, should Jive and Britney pursue that.<br /><br />Now, the duds on the album. Jacques Lu Cont's Thin White Duke Mix of \\"Breathe on Me\\" is absolutely horrible. And the last two tracks on the album aren't exactly bad. They just sound all too familiar to other remixes. Davidson Ospina 2005 Remix of \\"...Baby One More Time\\" sounds almost just like his remix that was a bonus track on the import version of her '...Baby One More Time' album. It sounds like he changed the beginning a TAD bit, and then it sounds like his original version. And \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\\" Hex Hector Club Mix (Edit) is just lacking something. Like words. It mostly just repeats the same lines and sighs here and there. Quite frankly, I don't like 95% instrumental remixes 5% vocal. I like them to actually remix the song instead of a line of the song.<br /><br />Overall, it's a nice little add to any Britney fans' collection. :)
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I love this show, and its music. The singers are phenominal!! Its wonderful to hear the two female lead voices so different in a show together. The Chenowith's soprano agaist Menzel's crazy great high belt is awesome. Their voices are great the music is exciting and the story is engaging. Can't wait to see it!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|She definitely knows how to reinvent herself. \\"Confessions\\" is a collection of fresh and new songs that just fit very well on a dancefloor. My favorite ones are \\"Jump\\" (her vocal in this song is amazing), \\"Get together\\" and \\"I love New York\\", although \\"Hung up\\", \\"Let it will be\\" and \\"Isaac\\" makes you feel like dancing. <br />Madonna proves once again that she is the most influent and impressive singer of pop and dance music. <br />
B0009I7NNA|4.0|M. Shadows...no screaming..what the hell?!?! I didn't know what to expect but was very eager to hear this new album. I have been a listener to Avenged since their second album and own sounding the 7th. My appeal to the band has always been their talent as musicians and M Shadows ability to belt out a wicked scream. When I found out A) they were signing with WB and B) the vocals were changing I was expecting to be dissapointed. On the contrary I was quite pleased with the album. Despite the lack of screaming the band really pulls it together. If you can appreciate good guitar and an amazing drummer then you should give this album a shot. A mix with the old AV7 and a G and R sound this album is a must for anyone with appreciation for a hardcore sound. Whoever wrote a kids review please stick your foot in your mouth because thrice is no match for AV7's talent. Either way go out and buy the album for yourself!
B000BM6AVA|4.0|Anyone who wants to buy this CD must remember that it is an extension of Mezmerize, they recorded these songs at the same time they did Mezmerize. In that sense it is quite a good album. It isn't as good as Mezmerize, but it does have some great songs on it. Kill Rock N' Roll, which is akin to Cigaro in its style, Hypnotize, which is new and softer, Tentative, which has an awesome message and a sweet chorous, Vicinity of Obscenity, which is like Chicken Stu of Steal This Album!, and Lonely Day and Soldier Side, which include some nice guitar solos(finally!).  <br />       System Of A Down is an incredible band whose work is perhaps best known in the hard rock/metal genre. Despite the negative reviews this is an awesome CD of theirs. Not their best, but definantly worth acquiring.  <br />       And, as regards to the way Daron sings, he's a good singer, I think, a welcome change to the S.O.A.D. sound. He is in this album a lot more than in Mezmerize. But, I still think Serj is a better singer, one of the best. Don't become to hateful of his singing if you are a S.O.A.D fan. He mightg be a lot more prevalent in the upcoming albums.

B0007GAERG|3.0|I'm one of those people who loves Mariah's voice but has very little patience with the type of music she does. She's a powerhouse vocalist but when I think about the mostly puerile lyrics/topics she sings about, I'm reminded of the jumbo jet pulling a flea. Noting the word \\"emancipation\\" in the title, I somehow expected that this album would represent a departure for her. Ater giving it few listens, I feel I was mistaken. I know this stuff is selling, but as with much of Mariah's past material, most of the songs have an airheaded, overly-marketed, and quickly forgettable quality to them. Another instance of loved the voice, hated the songs... or rather annoyed by the songs since \\"hated\\" is too strong a word for my reaction to this stuff. Mariah has the potential to be a great recording artist, but it ain't gonna happen until she starts doing better material.  <br /> <br />Note to the 1-star posters who feel compelled to make nasty comments about this or other singers:if you've taken the time to listen to someone's work and honestly don't like it, by all means, give it a negative review. But please, don't post just to slag the singer.

0743454537|4.0|Picoult's novel examines the current debate concerning designer children who have been bred to match critically ill siblings with an eye toward donation.  Initially, Anna is asked to donate tissue that can be regenerated.  Though she must experience painful proceedures to save her sister's life, none will have a detrimentally lasting effect on her future.  However, when she is asked to donate a kidney which means she will be precluded from engaging in her favorite sport and which will have future life consequences on childbearing and other major life events, she resists.  She hires an attorney to seek her medical emancipation. At what point is it too much to ask one child to sacrifice quality of life for the actual life of a sibling?  This is the question presented to the reader.  It is a question of the moment that can be all too real.  Unfortunately, the ending is a cop out so niether the reader nor the author must answer it on these facts.  I really loved this book and would have given it 5 stars had it not been for the ending. It was too neatly tied up with a little bow. Once I started it I could not put it down.  It is a fast and easy read.
0743454537|5.0|Jodi Picoult did an amazing job at how she used such hidden details to symbolize the main theme of her story. You probably wont have a clue about it while your reading, but after you finish the book everything comes together and you will be shocked to realize all of the cryptic metaphors. I also loved how she was able to use a twist of reality and what might possibly become real later in the future. This book has it all. Family issues, characters' personal ethics, choices, and even a few love scenes here and there. Picoult also emphasized some important characters of a typical mother, father, teenager girl, etc. This made me more sensitive to the situation and I felt as if I knew the characters personally. Although there were some pages I skimmed through because of the occasional boring parts that seemed to be nothing but a \\"busy read\\", I absolutely loved this book in overall. The characters, the theme, the conclusion were all put together in order to keep me alive while reading it. Speaking of the ending, if you read this book you will know what Im talking about but the ending wasn't what I had in mind for this book at all. It was one of the best ironic ending I've read! Ok, by now you can all probably tell how much I loved this book! so I definetly recommend everyone to read it!

B000B8QEZG|5.0|It's probably the best dance album, or possibly the best album released this year.  There's not one single dud in the bunch and it'll be sure to have everyone on the dancefloor.  Mixed like a DJ set, all the songs blend seamlessly into the next, but never loose their individual appeal.  Those who hate it at first will eventually succumb to it's infectious beats, catchy lyrics, and pulsating aura.  Madonna brings us her best work since \\"Ray of Light\\".  After the so-so \\"Music\\" and the politically polarizing \\"American Life\\", Madonna returns back to doing what she does best: making infectious pop music.  This is the fun Madonna we missed.

B0001ADAVK|3.0|We watched the movie \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" for our English lessons at school. We watched it, because we had the topic \\" gender roles\\" and so in our opinion the movie was very interesting and supported the topic. The movie shows on the one hand how a emancipated woman carry through the society of the 50's and on the other hand how the society don't understand and accept her behaviour.  <br />When the view of the people were very conservatively, it was tradition that young women get married and became housewives and mothers, even when they were talented and put down excellent school exams. No exception make there the graduates of the famous Wellesley College in Massachusetts. Katherine Watson(Julia Roberts) a young free-mental lecturer for history of art wants to teach not only history of art to her pupils, but to encourage rather a striving for self-sufficiency and independence and also to break out of the long-existing traditions. Only once it pushes thereby on refusal, from arrogant young ladies, who have above all their future role as wife, mother and perfect hostess in the view. She is also criticized from her colleagues, because of her unusual teaching methods. The author not only shows the life of Katherine, but also of some students at the college like the sexually curious Giselle(Maggie Gyllenhaal)and the bright Joan (Julia Stiles). <br />In our opinion the acting achievement of the female main characters are very good and sympathetic.
B000BM6AVA|2.0|I've been a SOAD fan for years, ever since I saw the sugar video in 7th grade....I'm now 2 years into college and I have noticed that System has kind of lost it.  Mesmerize was a pretty good release, there are a lot of sing along choruses, but there are enough harder songs to keep me listening.  Now for Hypnotize....this cd is not top notch SOAD.  I realize that over the years they have gotten more and more mainstream.  Every song on here sounds like it could be a single, except for, my fav, \\"vicinity of Obscenity.\\"  This song is so weird, its the only reasong I'm going to keep this cd.  So if you've been living in a hole for the past, almost, 10 years and you haven't heard SOAD, stick with their 1st and Toxicity, you won't be disappointed.
B000BBOUU4|4.0|My daughter requested to watch this film because Annasophia Robb was in it. My son wanted to see it because Johnny Depp was in it, and to be truthful, I had no intentions of seeing it as I am not into remakes because they rarely do the original film justice. But I have to tell you that Charlie And The Chocolate Factory cannot be compared to its counterpart, Willy and the Wonka Factory, because they are two entirely different versions and each film can not only stand on its own merits, but reach two different audiences.
B00005JOHI|4.0|\\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" directed by Joe Wright, is a beautifully mounted version of the beloved Jane Austen classic.  Gorgeously filmed on location in England, the movie stars Keira Knightley as the spirited Elizabeth Bennet.  Knightley has luminous eyes, a wickedly mischievous smile, and a saucy manner.  The director wisely zooms in on her captivating face in a number of tight close-ups.  Matthew MacFadyen plays Mr. Darcy as an aloof and sullen gentleman, who hides his smoldering sexuality beneath a stolid facade.  Brenda Blethyn is appropriately dithery as the nervous and silly Mrs. Bennet, a mother of five daughters who is desperate to marry her children off to men of means.  Mr. Bennet, played solidly by Donald Sutherland, frequently hides in his study in order to get a respite from his noisy and high-spirited brood.  Also noteworthy are Tom Hollander as the stuffy and pompous Mr. Collins; his pursuit of Elizabeth is met with undisguised disdain.  Dame Judi Dench is formidable in her cameo as the imperious and overbearing Lady Catherine de Bourg. Less successful are the miscast Simon Woods, who turns in a nerdy performance as the carrot-topped Mr. Bingley, and Rosamund Pike, as Jane Bennet, is lovely to look at but a bit too vapid.<br /><br />Roman Osin, the cinematographer, captures the lush beauty of the English countryside and the glamor of Darcy's and Bingley's estates.  The camera is always in motion, panning over the dancers in a ballroom, a breathtaking sunset, a rainy field, and the expressions on the characters' faces.  There is rarely a dull moment in this film. Unfortunately, the dialogue is sometimes difficult to follow because the Wright frequently directs his actors to speak over one another.  In addition, unlike Dench, whose diction is impeccable, some of the performers speak too quickly and fail to enunciate.<br /><br />Another quibble is that the screenwriter, Deborah Moggach, gives short shrift to  Austen's underlying themes of snobbery, social stratification, and the constraints of women in eighteenth century England.  These issues are certainly implied, but they are peripheral to Elizabeth and Darcy's romance, which takes center stage. Still, this movie is a treat for the mind and heart. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is an enchanting, wildly romantic, and entertaining love story that will please all but the most finicky Austen purists.social stratification, and the constraints of women in eighteenth century England.

B000AGTPUA|3.0|Throughout the film children are taken into the magical world of make-believe where they are entertained by dancing, singing waiters; ride the roller coaster of their lives; experience the great ice adventure; and finally get to see Santa's hometown-the North Pole. <br /> <br />In The Polar Express, many children enter the train but only two step outside themselves to see what's truly important, friendship. While the other children party on the train and eagerly wait for their chance to receive the first Christmas gift of the year, two children reach out to a lonely, poor boy. Throughout the film, you'll watch the compassion for another human evolve into a friendship that helps three children find their inner-strength.
B00007AJGH|5.0|You heard me, this was one of his best performances. Second only to \\"Sir Arthur Connan Doyle's The Lost World\\" in which I think was the best. All in all, this is a classic movie that is worth your time. Buy it now.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|\\"Amarantine\\" is exactly why I continue to purchase Enya CDs. The CD contains haunting ballads about love, longing, and loss, a deep instrumental, and nicely tucked in the middle, a fun, rousing Celtic tune as one could only expect from Enya. The imagery her music evokes is charming. My only complaint is that the CD is relatively short at just over 45 minutes but that's why I have all her other works. A great addition to my collection. If you love Enya's music, you'll love \\"Amarantine.\\" Beautiful music, beautifully done. Bravo!
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|I loved this movie. It is an instant classic with up to date special effects. I also noticed book elements from \\"The Count Of Monte Cristo\\" by Alexandre Dumas in it. Overall, a classic, buy yours today.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna does it again, I have played this to alot of people, even the ones who usually do not like Pop or dance music and they all loved it. I have yet to have 1 single person say I really don't like that. EVERY song is single quality. When is the last time you bought a CD that had more than just a couple of good songs??? Well guys and dolls THIS is a must have. Need cheering up? This is it. A masterpiece!!!  I'd give it 6-stars.
B000002C2E|5.0|I really don't understand why so many see this brilliant work of Bob Dylan as \\"bleak,\\" let alone terrifyingly bleak. Even when I was a kid...a little kid...and my sister died in 3 days of some mysterious ailment, I knew life somehow might not have a \\"happy\\" ending. The point is this: who really cares whether a great artist - no, actually the greatest artist in poetry-music-and-composition with a dash of magic and mysticism [who gifts us with his take of \\"time\\" (illusive at best) or \\"mind\\" (virtually impossible to navigate)] is being \\"positive\\" or \\"negative?\\" I destest those words, and I am not evolved enough to label genuis. I can't frame Bob Dylan in this album or any other. I can't even define myself! It changes, moves, flows, grows, or it's dead. All I can say as a woman who came of age in the 1960's that - I want the truth - unvarnished, stripped of any sugar-coating but with style, panache, class, and grace - oh yes, genius too. If I'm honest, there's many a time for feeling sad, (maybe even sadder than sad)...and one reaches for a companion along the way. It doesn't have to be a voice at the end of a phone; or a typed reply at the end of some email. It need only be sublime poetry and music from a man (a real man...) who knows just how tough this world is, and simply refuses to dissemble. That, in and of itself, gets me up off the floor and standing once again. For when we really are afraid of truth, we are running away from ourselves...and thank God there are many who refuse to do so - like the one, and the only, Bob Dylan.
B00005JO0J|5.0|It boggles the mind that the self medicating masses fell over each other to see \\"Doom\\", while ignoring this gem. One of the best science fiction films in recent memory, based on the failed TV show \\"Firefly\\". I guess if it actually 'failed' there wouldn't  have been a film, now would it? Great characters and dialogue that is never seen in SF films for \\"today's sophisticated audience\\". Am I the only one tired of that subversive phrase? As if to say anything that came before today's CGI SF garbage isn't worth anything. Like \\"Stealth\\" or \\"The Island\\" are filmatic events compared to \\"2001\\", the original \\"Planet of the Apes\\", \\"Forbidden Planet\\", etc. Get this when it comes out on DVD. You won't be sorry.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|Not System's best album, but still quite good. <br /> <br />They're still one of the top bands out there, if not the top. <br />If you see them live, there is no argument....amazing. <br /> <br />This album needs to grow on you, but I can't imagine liking it as much as Mez.. or any of their old better songs.   <br /> <br />Some of the songs are skippable but the rest grow on you. <br /> <br />If you've crowned a halo on system, you'll love this. <br />If not you'll just think it's the album of the month or 2, that you'll back too from time to time.
0553801503|5.0|I picked up the book knowing full-well what George was giving us.  He's not telling the whole story, just parts of it from certain characters' viewpoints.  I knew that many of my favorites wouldn't appear.  I knew that this is only half the story that he wants to tell.  (And much of this info is right there in the book for you before you even begin reading.)  If you know what to expect, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Being that I came into this with the appropriate expectations, I THOROUGHLY enjoyed the book.  Martin is maintaining the level of quality that he is known for.<br /><br />It's just unfortunate that publishing limitations force this into two books instead of one.  Rest assured that he DOES tell this portion of the storylines from beginning to end and that, in the next book, he intends to do so with the rest of the storylines from the same time period.<br /><br />And \\"Jordan\\"-izing the series?  I don't think so at all!  George still has a definitive ending planned.  He just realized when he got to the planned \\"five-year gap\\" that the story wouldn't work well that way.  I'm tired of people trying to compare him to Jordan.  It's just not the same situation.
B000B5XOSO|5.0|if there is one Batman film that has it all, its this one. not only is it a great Batman  <br /> <br />Film, but a great film all around. the performances are masterful, especially michelle  <br /> <br />pfieffer, she practically stole the show. danny devito IS the Penguin, and even if they  <br /> <br />ever in the future plan to bring penguin back in a different style, its danny devito's  <br /> <br />nicholson-esque acting that makes his version unforgettable. same with Catwoman, IMO noone  <br /> <br />will ever carry catwoman as michelle did, she's absolutly stunning in this role, as both  <br /> <br />catwoman in that tight leather AND as selina kyle, mousy or not. <br /> <br />Michael Keaton is still Batman, even 13 years after this film was made, he still holds the  <br /> <br />top title as \\"best Batman to ever walk the earth\\". alot of ppl like to say that christian  <br /> <br />bale holds that title, but i beg to differ.

0380789035|3.0|The truth was that I wasn't interested in the premise of this book, at least what the book reviews, and Back Page claimed the premise to be.  When I started reading it though,  the basic idea surprised me and interested me. The beginning of this book is very well crafted, and could draw just about any reader in. Now that being said the book does not keep that same pace, nor compelling nature. The book is laced with great ideas here and there, but they are not put together by a collective Heart.  The book is very much like a scrambled poorly built extravegant car. It is nice to look at here and there, and has some nice features, but ultimately it doesn't run very well, and takes you just about no where.<br />  There are some great inconsistencies in the book as well.  Everything in the book will not match up with your basic knowledge of...well about everything.  Gaiman cherry picks. He picks what he likes and plugs it in where he likes even if it doesn't harmonize completely with his basic premise. This left me frustrated, and ultimately somewhat bored. I almost did not finish this book. I found myself ambivalent about it in whole, and about what the ending might entail.<br />  THe book is allright, it's just not what it could be. I love the idea of the American Gods being TV, Malls, the Internet...etc. I just don't buy the \\"old gods\\" stuff too much. It doesn't make as much sense. What about all of the other immigrants that came to america? And thier Gods? or gods?  America is a very complex and interesting spiritual place. Religions are born here, and brought here year after year.  There are about a billion forms of Christianity that are unique to America alone, not to mention all of the new age that seems never ending as well. THere are also abundant new forms of legend here, John Henry, The New Jersey Devil, Big Foot, Area 51 etc. I don't want to get into details with out spoiling the substance, or non-substance of the book. I just thought that it completely underachieved, but I applaude Gaiman for coming up with some very clever ideas, and clever writing here and there.<br />  I heard that The Anansi Boys(a thematic sequel) is better, but I don't think that I have the patience, or desire to find out.<br /> 3 stars---  1 star for the story, and 2 for the ideas.underachieved, but I applaude Gaiman for coming up with some very clever ideas, and clever writing here and there.

0399143904|4.0|This is the first Tom Clancy book i read, and it is very good. There are countless good points about this book. There are so many characters, so many plot twists, and a good variety of aspects of this book. The action parts of the book is probably the best I have ever read. The story is expertly told and you could only guess of what the ending will be.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|Having been lucky enough to catch the John Mayer Trio in Minneapolis, I was eager to hear how accurately this CD recreated the show.  It was my second live experience with Mr. Mayer, having caught him in an arena setting with Guster the previous year. In that environment, it seemed like John was trying to live up to the Dave Matthews comparisons, with his Any Given Thursday band, plus a horn section, a pianist, and some backing vocalist/acoustic guitarist for some reason.  Songs like \\"Come Back To Bed\\" were interminably stretched to ten-plus minutes, and the proceedings had an air of self-indulgence.  Mayer seemed to have caught whiff of this, as he stripped down to the bare minimum, flanking himself with two peerless professionals in the form of Steve Jordan and Pino Palladino.  Not only was the band pared, but the venues as well, with the Trio performing at small clubs for a few hundred people.  And the indulgence was strictly in the richness of his musical influences, with the platinum-selling albums and their hits all but forgotten.  At the show I attended, the band opened with an awesome version of \\"Every Day I Have The Blues\\" before launching into \\"Who Do You Think I Was\\" which starts things off here.  The song rocks, if having a few too many winks (\\"Is he the one who turns the ladies on?\\"), along with the old LP-style liner notes and the \\"Connecticut\\" line slightly taking away from the otherwise deep sincerity.  Other highlights include \\"Good Love Is On The Way\\", featuring the catchiest riff of the album, and the original bluesy treatment of \\"Daughters\\" which suits the song much better. Steve Jordan adds so much vitality in his drumming and backing vocals, while Pino anchors the proceedings admirably (not unlike his predecessor in The Who).  Some surprises would have been nice; as another reviewer said, I would have loved to have heard a band version of \\"Love Soon\\", one of Mayer's best songs, or even the obscure \\"George's Blues\\" for laughs. \\"Something's Missing\\" is a little redundant, even though it was slightly rewritten since its debut on Any Given Thursday. I still have great admiration for Mayer virtually starting the group's setlist from scratch.  Thankfully the mixers have taken down the audience in the mix so as not to overwhelm the musicians.  I can attest that even though he didn't play \\"Wonderland\\" or \\"Come Back To Bed\\", the girls in the audience used their upper registers in unison multiple times, which inflicted far more strain on my ears than the amplifiers.  Simultaneously, I was quite impressed by how eager men and women in my age group were willing to follow the Trio's blues excursions, and hopefully those who didn't make the shows will catch some of that infectiousness here.   A highly satisfying start for the Trio (I suspect it will have more replay value than previous J.M. live releases), and hopefully they won't be just an experimental stunt. An enthusiastic four stars, since we reserve five for stuff like Live At Leeds.
B000A2WF3S|5.0|Gidon Kremer has again recorded the Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violin of Bach and while his facility and technical grace are intact, in this recording he appears to have been deeply influenced by his time with the moderns (Adams, P&auml;rt, Schnittke, Piazzola, Glass, et al).  For this listener it seems that studying and performing these contemporary composers' manipulation of sound and instrumental scope has enriched Kremer's thought about the perfection of Bach.<br /><br />Not everyone will agree with Kremer's approach to these works on this new recording, but for those who know Bach's solo violin pieces there are pleasures in store.  Remaining technically suave and with a luxuriant tone, Kremer seems to be communicating with the psychological Bach, offering different tempi and more soulful approaches than those of his colleagues. The results are mesmerizing.<br /><br />The sonics of this release are impeccable: the soloist is immediately in the room with the listener.  This recording is a must for those who have followed Kremer's impressive career and for those who wish to venture outside the norm for a fresh approach to the wonders of Bach's genius.  Highly recommended. Grady Harp, November 05
B0006L16N8|1.0|There are so many reasons to hate coldplay. I sometimes find it difficult to believe that such inoffensive music manages to offend me so much, but it does. When I hear Fix You come on the radio it makes me so angry - not with the band, who are \\"just trying to connect with people\\" in the most commercially viable way - but with the people that actually bought it. Have you lost your minds? At what point did you stop actually thinking about music and BUY THIS CRAP?! Chris Martin is perhaps one of the few people around that can combine being insipid with being surprisingly arrogant. It comes across in his interviews, his singing voice, his lyrics...so why buy it?    Their early songs - shiver, yellow, and the scientist - were fairly pleasant, romantic pop songs. They were bland, sure, but they didn't make you want to rip your own ears off. Songs like Fix You, however,  seem perfectly calculated to create previously unsuspected levels of nausea in even the most casual of listeners, and it's astonishing. I blame U2 for this, as Coldplay suddenly seemed to become obsessed with plagarising U2 instead of Radiohead (they probably make more money). However, even the pompous U2 aren't this obnoxious, and that is saying something.    Lets analyse this!  \\"When you lose something you can't replace  When you love someone, but it goes to waste  Could it be worse?\\"  Yes, it really could be. Perhaps Mr Martin intends for us to fill in the gaps here: the loss of \\"something\\" could refer to the use of your four limbs, or maybe your entire family in a bomb blast. But Coldplay are too preoccupied with trying to please as many people as they can so they can take their money off them. The result of this is me having to listen to people singing along to these lyrics whilst revelling in self pity and feeling really \\"deep\\", when actually theyre just thinking about how they're having a bad hair day, or maybe how they've been ripped off by Apple's built-in obsilesance policy on iPods.       My question is, how can music publications like Q magazine give 5 star reviews for this album with a straight face? With no hint of irony? I have concluded that it is all part of a cynical ploy to sell more magazines, more albums, to more mindless, dribbling idiots.  Overall this music makes me sad. If you want to feel good about music then listen to some good bands - Radiohead (infinitly better than Coldplay), the White Stripes (they took 2 weeks to make their latest, brilliant album - Coldplay took 2 years to make this monumental piece of rubbish) or the Beatles. But then, just anything is better than this. Even U2.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album is truly incredible - honestly a great ride, especially for those in the mood for a workout. I'm already preparing to run with it on. I'm always intrigued by how many either love or loathe Madonna. I think most people find it hard to move beyond the icon and the images she puts forth and just enjoy great pop music. I like debate, but while I'd love to converse with - and disagree with - Madonna and her personal rhetoric, I'd much prefer to just enjoy the music. And listening to this album is non-stop enjoyment, literally from the moment this album starts with \\"Hung Up,\\" it never really slows down. Unlike American Life, there are lots of great singles here: \\"Get Together,\\" \\"Sorry,\\" \\"Jump,\\" \\"How High,\\" and \\"Let It Will Be\\" are near perfection. Overall, it far exceeded my expectations. No question she's the Queen of Pop in my music library.
B000002VFW|5.0|Remember 1990?  New Kids On The Block?  Sinead O'Connor?  Earth Day?  In 1990, while I was writing a novel that was never published, Lisa Stansfield was having a lot more success with her huge hit, \\"All Around The World\\".  I loved the song, but for some reason it took me 15 years to get around to buying the CD.  Anyway, I'm glad I did.  What I found is a fabulous collection of beats, in a lyrical setting where Love is Master, for better or worse.  The musical arrangements, to a great extent latter-day disco in the first part of the album, give way to excellent early 90's club music as it progresses.  A slight jazz tinge can be heard throughout.  Lisa sings with soul and authority, and her warm, expressive voice is complemented perfectly by the swirling strings and glistening synths.  By the way, 63 minutes, 13 cuts and none of them bad - this adds up to \\"your money's worth\\" on a very good CD.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|So at the show my good friend and I couldn't help but torture the 15 year old girls who came to a \\"John Mayer\\" show.  Asking what their favorite songs were and what they wanted to hear that night, then quickly responding with \\"not gonna happen hunny\\"   <br />First-you have to know what you are getting into with this album. This isn't John Mayer.  And please know who the hell he is workin with, these musicians are well respected individuals and anyone in music today would be honored to work with these two guys. <br />Pino Palladino on bass-he's recorded with everyone-Eric Clapton, Don Henley, Phil Collins, Chaka Khan.  He toured with Jeff Beck, The Who, Simon and Garfunkel! <br />Steve Jordan-\\"the funkiest drummer alive\\"-recorded with Bob Marley, Ziggy Marley, Herbie Hancock-he's been playing with blues acts since the middle 70s. <br />Basic point is these guys are highly regarded blues musicians. <br />This album is simply amazing, the live experience was 10x this. Pick up this album and be impressed. This is not your little sister's John Mayer album, he finally has shown what he is capable of.

B0002J4ZWS|4.0|Good movie, but I've got two complaints: <br /> <br />Firstly, I like sad endings - think Midnight Cowboy, Dog Day Afternoon, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest. I would have much preferred an ending where we didn't know for sure whether Red would meet up again with Andy. You know, as in its Red's SEARCH for Andy that is poignant, whether he actually FINDS his friend, or whether his search is futile - we're better off not being told. <br /> <br />Why do you Americans need films with happy endings, anyway? <br /> <br />Secondly, I loved the fact that we don't know at the start whether Andy is guilty or innocent. The episodic bit in the middle of the film - with the \\"kid\\" and the overheard jailhouse confession story that proves Andy innocent - spoils this ambiguity for me. The Andy character is much more complex when you don't quite know whether he's an innocent man (as he claims), or whether he's a good (but flawed) man who's been pushed passed his breaking point. Now, that really would be about \\"Redemption\\"! <br /> <br />
B000BJS4SU|5.0|This is a wonderful new album by John Mayer and his all-star trio. First of all, there is none of the crap with copywrite protection that Sony has on all of their other cds now (Where you can't burn it onto your iPod) so you can listen to this cd anywhere :-) I love how different these tracks are from most of Mayer's other stuff (at least his well-known radio hits \\"Your Body Is A Wonderland\\" and \\"Daughters.\\" I highly recommend this cd to anyone who likes blues, rock, or any of John Mayer's other stuff. Also, the sound is very good if anyone was wondering, considering all of the tracks are live recordings.
B000B8QEYC|4.0|Enya continues to produce soothing music with simple Celtic-tinged melodies and New Age oriented instrumentations and production.  Her latest release offers more of what Enya fans have been captivated by but the album is pretty short while the wait for it has been lengthy.  The track Sumiregusa was previously released for free online after being used in an ad campaign for a major electronics company - the song is inspired by Japanese haiku.  There are no surprises here but just a set of more music that maintains the Enya sound - a musical phenomenon which has enthralled listeners and generated interest in Celtic & new age music among many people who wouldn't have otherwise explored these genres.  Enjoy this album and then explore other similar music while you wait for Enya to craft some more music - it may be awhile.
B00000K2UX|5.0|I do not have a particular liking for 80's rock nor am I a fan of the original motion picture.  So with those two facts in mind, I think it's safe to say that I have an unbiased opinion compltely untainted by mainstream hype.  The Top Gun Soundtrack is completly worthy of the flawless 5 star rating.  It doesn't matter which genre of music you enjoy, the tracks on this anthology translate into every genre is one way or another.  I bought this album at a whim when I saw it on sale for 10$ at Best Buy and boy did I get my moneys worth.
0385484518|5.0|Just saw a snippet of Morrie's interview with Ted Koppel and felt compelled to write a short review about this book. <br /> <br />As a cynic who rarely looks at the positive side of things, the book really woke me up and made me understood what gratitude meant and how it can change your life.  Despite his illness and decaying \\"body\\", Morrie's spirit was very much alive and goes to show us the true strength of the human spirit. <br /> <br />A well written book that lead to MANY moments of laughter and tears and finally, satisfaction as you read through the final chapters.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|This was the last album recorded by Johnny Cash. And in his farewell (I think he knew this would be the last time around) Cash reflects on his long and prodigious career with a satisfying album such as this one. <br /> <br />Johnny Cash is a member of the Million Dollar Quartet, that is a group of four entertainers including Cash, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Elvis Presley who began recording on the Sun label in Memphis at the dawn of the Rock and Roll age. Cash the only one we have really had a chance to see age, and that's what endears him to so many people. You can listen to him age in voice, body, mind, and soul all the way from his early recordings like \\"Walk the Line,\\" and \\"Folsom Prison Blues,\\" to this album which includes CASH covers of \\"Hurt\\" among others. I don't know if Elvis could have maintained his longevity as well as Cash did, but I'm glad he was around to record this one.
0894803123|4.0|This book provides an introduction into the science of ice cream making, Ben & Jerry's style.  It begins with a short history of the Ben & Jerry's ice cream story-don't skip this part-it's quite amusing in places.  Then they bring on the main event, the ice cream recipes, first the bases, then the variations.  Following this is a section on other desserts and sweets to be served with the ice cream, delicacies like super-fudge brownies and whipped cream.<br /><br />One aspect I really like about this book is that they generally use just the 3 different ice cream bases provided at the beginning of the book.  All the remaining recipes rely on one of those bases, but they add instructions about quantities of other ingredients and how to prepare them before adding them to the ice cream.  This approach enables novice ice cream makers to really get a handle on the science of making ice cream, rather than having to deal with entirely new recipes each time. Ben and Jerry include in their recipes numerous tips for success-it's clear that they didn't simply try these recipes out in a test kitchen.  These guys actually had to try sell the results to customers, a much higher quality standard than just seeing if the taste was passable.  This book is one of the most used recipes books in our kitchen, not only for ice cream recipes, but for other essentials, like the giant chocolate chip cookie recipe (it even beat grandma's chocolate chip cookie recipe-no small feat!).<br /><br />The only drawback to the book is its reliance on raw eggs in a great number of the recipes.  Perhaps it was safe to put eggs in your ice cream without cooking them back in the 80s when this book was written, but you should really think twice before doing so now.  These days, thanks to factory egg farms, you have to assume that supermarket eggs are contaminated with salmonella even inside the shells, so you must cook them well before eating them, and especially before serving anything made with eggs to small children or older folks.  Freezing doesn't kill bacteria-it just slows growth down a bit, so if an egg contains salmonella and goes into ice cream uncooked, the results could be disastrous. To be on the safe side, either cook the ingredients for the ice cream bases that include eggs over a low heat until they thicken, then chill before freezing, or use eggs from sources you know to be salmonella free.to small children or older folks.

0307276902|5.0|Not a book for the faint at heart. Very open and honest with descriptions that can cause you to wince, due to pain, disgust, and sorrow. James Frey is an extremely courageous and strong person to endure and ultimately claim victory!  Addiction is a disease, yet, it is a choice.  I completely agree with James.  Kudos to you James for defying all of the non-believers and paving a new way to recovery!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This would be one of few things I would ever give such a high rating.  I hadn't heard of Firefly ever unitl recently (sadly I was out of the country for its entire run), but it truely is one of the best shows I've ever seen.  In particular, I love the last four episodes and watch them quite often without tire.  The movie is amazing too, an absolute must have.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|\\"Confessions On a Dance Floor\\" opens up a new period for Madonna's music, one where she's going back to before she started making music, blending in a disco-like sound with bits and pieces from her \\"Ray of Light\\" period. With multiple producers lined up at her side and this being her sixth no. 1 album, it took over the dance and pop charts by storm soon after its release, ruling in a way only she can get us used to.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Hung Up\\", an ABBA-tribute song leading into one song after another of solid performances, with \\"Let It Will Be\\" and \\"Jump\\" serving as two solid album anchors. Though the last two tracks loose a bit of power, the album as a whole is a very impressive production that reconfirms Madonna as the undisputed Queen of Pop and shows her at the top of her musical condition. Without a doubt, one of the best albums of 2005.
0064407667|3.0|The Baudelaire children live in comfort and security, wholesome, inventive, intelligent children until one day while at the beach they receive devastating news. Their parents have been killed during a house fire, and all of their worldly belongings have also been destroyed in the pyre. An associate of their parents, a banker named Mr. Poe, takes them in for a few days, but then informs them that they are going to live with an obscure, somewhat estranged, relative on the opposite end of town, an actor by the name of Count Olaf.<br /><br />At first the Count seems to be an eccentric, a man who's house has fallen into disrepair and a shabby state of neglect. The Baudelaire children are horrified at the atrocious state of affairs that is to be their new home, and also the fact that there is only one bed in their \\"Room\\", and no crib for the youngest child, Sunny. Things go from bad to worse as they are assigned labor intensive chores from Count Olaf, including making supper for him and his theatre troupe friends one evening... all 13 of them.<br /><br /> Count Olaf quickly degenerates from an old eccentric to an abusive, fowl mouthed drunk, and the children, of course, suspect his motives for taking them in in the first place. Violet, the eldest, stands to inherit a fortune when she comes of age, and Olaf is aware of this, and concocts a plan to \\"marry\\" her onstage, or he will harm the youngest child, whom he has locked up in his tower... apparently the requirements for marriage in this community are quite simple, and with a few minor necessities provided the Count can perform the wedding and seize control of the Baudelaire's entire fortune, however the children have a few tricks up their sleeve to prevent this from occurring.<br /><br />This is one of those books that I probably would have loved as a child. Reading it, as an adult, I can see the merit to it, but I am no longer entertained by it. The story was cute, but predictable, the characters were fun, but meant to amaze other children. The writing was clear and flowed well, however their were things that got annoying after a while, for example the author's usage of vocabulary lessons in the middle of sentences. I see why he is doing this, but it gets irritating quickly. The book, however was a fun read, I think I polished it off in a little over an hour. It's a bit reminiscent of Dahl's work, which I still love, so I will give the author some credit there. I am mildly interested to see what else happens in some of the other books, but I don't know that I will be rushing out to read them all any time soon. I think children will love this book, however.

B00005JNBQ|4.0|Within 20 minutes you will know if you're going to love or hate this film.  There is a general story line here:  a particularly nerdy high school boy stumbles through life, aware that he is often treated poorly, but apparently oblivious to his own idiosyncracies.  Various themes are touched upon:  family dysfunction, geeks get girls, and how self-confidence can overpower even near-constant peer negativity. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, the enjoyment Dynamite offers is in the over-all effect of this clumsy, often clueless hero plowing through life, successfully overcoming a constant flow of obstacles.  In the end, good hearts win, and sometimes even jerks can find redemption. <br /> <br />There is no doubt that this offering is quirky, quite weird, and will prove grating to some viewers.  Thus, my 4-stars is Ebert's 1.5.  Napolean Dynamite will either grow on you, or cause you to start pulling out your hair.   <br /> <br />Bottom-line:  To thine own self be true.  Either enjoy the ride, or bail out before you require Rogaine!
B000002LK1|5.0|What a silly criticism, to cast off Violator for being \\"too\\" perfect!<br /><br />This is a perfect album.  There is no filler.  The album is perfectly balanced.  The instrumental interludes are neither too long, nor too short.  Can't we be grateful for that?<br /><br />Being in my late twenties, I discovered Depeche Mode with this album.  Those who keep insisting that it doesn't live up to Black Celebration or Some Great Reward are at least a half-decade older than me, and can't seperate sentimental attachment from objective criticism.<br /><br />The first three tracks are, in essence, sex drug and rock & roll.  The sex comes with World in My Eyes, a seductive song that pulsates and throbs.  Sweetest Perfection is about drug use and self-denial.  The orchestral swell that follows the line \\"...but everyone knows what has got me\\" is a mark of incredible genius.  And Personal Jesus is rock and roll, synth-filtered.  It was, is, and always will be one of DM's greatest singles.<br /><br />Alas, a third of the album is already gone.  It is kind of weird that they only chose nine tracks to be on the album.  At one time, I thought that Dangerous should have been included.  But, looking back, it would have upset the balance.<br /><br />I agree that the next track, Halo, could have been a single here in the U.S.  I still think of that Fellini-inspired video.  I love the sound effect at the beginning of the track, which is vaguely tribal.  By this point in the album, you realize that the great soundscapes are matched by air-tight lyrics.<br /><br />Waiting for the Night was a personal favorite when I was an angst-ridden teenager, in search of some meaning in my life.  Yes, silly as it sounds, I cried the first time I heard it.<br /><br />There is a perfect link between Waiting for the Night and Enjoy the Silence.  For me, nothing will ever top Enjoy the Silence.  It is pure heaven, and stikes you the same, no mater how many of hundreds of times you have heard it.  And the video is quintessential.<br /><br />Policy of Truth is another good single- maybe my least favorite of the four, by that's ONLY by default.  It is followed by Blue Dress, which has that wonderful \\"squeal\\" sound in it.  Then, there's that moody bridge that seperates it from clean.  Clean is the antithesis of Sweetest Perfection.  Ultimately, it's a lie- Dave Gahan's downward spiral was still to come.  Still, it's a great closer.ard it.

1400031087|5.0|A tell-almost-all story of tragedy and triumph on the most personal of levels...could not put this one down! James Frey tells a raw, detailed, painful account of his descent into the madness of addiction and the discovery of recovery...and no 12 steps allowed!! The amazing part for me is how he seems to have come through to the other side whole...Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. A must read for anyone in or working with those in addicition/recovery/substance abuse...practicing or not.
0307276902|5.0|I thought the book was a real page turner.  I could not put it down. The author gave very good insight on what it is like to be in rehabilitation program.I would highly recommend this book to read.  It is a must read.
B00003CXAW|5.0|After languishing in DVD limbo for the past couple of years, Kong is finally on DVD and he looks great. Well, the print of this classic, legendary film does. Lovers of classic films and lovers of Kong in particular shouldn't be disappointed. While there are still scratches and speckling in some areas, these are brief and do not distract. Overall, \\"Kong' looks better here than any print I've ever seen. It was a new experience viewing this DVD and the trip to Skull Island was even more enjoyable this time around. Any of the packages offered by Warner Bros. of \\"Kong\\" should please fans if they all look like this. I chose this basic 2-disc because \\"Kong\\" is the only one of the films I wanted. And it has the second disc of documentaries included. So, whichever one you choose---enjoy.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|This album is amazing, it seems to be the perfect mix of rock/metal/vocals and growling, which is used sparingly. Dont waste your money on their other cd's though, this is by far the best one and in my opinion, the only one worth buying. If you like the samples above, you'll love this cd.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna's Confessions on a Dance Floor is a welcome return to what she does best--making shameless dance pop! I'm not going to review every song here, but will cover a few highlights.<br /><br />First a word about INSTRUMENTATION: Overall, the album has a full, almost orchestral quality. Basslines are deep, growling and pulsating. Live- and synth-strings accent Madonna's vocals, and while this is an electronic album overall, it sounds and feels very organic. Others have likened it to \\"Producing a Phil Spector `Wall of Sound'-style album for the dance floor\\"--and I agree!<br /><br />The much talked-about CONTINUOUS MIX of the album is done extremely well. It's not the `128 beats of unremarkable overlap between each song' that one typically hears on DJ-mix CDs. It is a more traditional, symphonic style of segueing between songs. In some cases, the songs are simply butted together and sound seamless because they share a consistent tempo and instrumentation. In other cases, a final melody from one song will carry into the next, subtly fading away during the first verse. The effect is almost unnoticeable during a casual listen, but music aficionados will find themselves listening to these transitions over and over, picking up new details on which instruments are from the previous track, and which are from the next. It's an elegant and amazing effect.<br /><br />Now, for the songs: Rumor has it WB is considering five singles. I'm sure you know \\"Hung Up\\" by now, so let's skip to other likely candidates.<br /><br />JUMP - Easily the best song on the album, and far better than Hung Up. Likely to be single #3. Madonna's vocal delivery is somewhere between \\"Keep it Together\\" and \\"Rescue Me\\", and she sells the song beautifully. It also has an incredible string obbligato part similar to the one in \\"Causing a Commotion.\\" At about 120 BPM the rhythm is reminiscent of Information Society, and the tempo is excellent for dance pop. Expect great remixes in the 128-130 range on this one (Hello WB? Ralphi Rosario please!)<br /><br />SORRY - Rumored to be single #2. A great song which, following the more straightforward Hung Up and Get Together, has a frantic pace in comparison. Reminiscient of her \\"Till Death Do Us Part,\\" but without the unhappy subject matter. This one is all fun, energy, and sass.<br /><br />HOW HIGH - Has that slight postpunk/pop rhythm, similar to Kylie Minogue's \\"Come into My World.\\" One of the few truly introspective songs on the album, but despite being in a minor (or diminished, I can't quite tell) key, it is not the least bit depressing. It comes across as defiant. Not the sure-bet that Jump and Sorry are, but in an edited length it can be a radio hit.<br /><br />FUTURE LOVERS - Recreates the bubbling, pulsating bassline from Donna Summer's \\"I Feel Love,\\" however here, Stuart Price deepens the bass and adds a heavier bass drum. The spoken parts of the vocal are similar to Kylie Minogue's \\"Light Years\\", but the choral vocal is much more immediate. A great song as is for clubs, but could also be a radio hit if it were tightened up a bit.<br /><br />PUSH - This one feels more urban than the rest of the album because of Madonna's staccato vocal delivery. It's sassy and quite catchy.<br /><br />With at least six single-worthy songs and others that have great club rhythms, I recommend this album to any dance or pop music fans. The continuous mix makes skipping songs unnecessary (there are at most two skip-worthy songs on the album), and appreciators of good music production should love how well this continuous effect was done.se!)

B000BJS4OY|5.0|I'll make this short and sweet.  The record, BORN TO RUN has NEVER SOUNDED BETTER - the remastering is genius.  The DOCU on the making of the album is EXCELLENT - but the gem in this collection is a 30 year old 2 hour and 20 minute show that Bruce did in England  - what a set list - what great sound (though i had better luck in DSP general then their very inactive 5.1 mix) and this might be the best concert video ever - right next to the MSG show - this thing is INSANE.  You can't go wrong - it's a bargain.
052594527X|5.0|Tracy Chevalier's most famous novel is about the intriguing Vermeer painting of the title. Chevalier gives her an identity- she is of the lower working class, a maid in the household of Johaness Vermeer. Through her eyes, we see the striking world of the Dutch Delft and the varying societies of arists, craftsmen, domestics and nobility. Through language that is not excessively florid, Chevalier describes scenes that are as precise and realistic as Vermeer's paintings themselves. Griet, a quiet but wise young girl, becomes the object of Vermeer's interest, though it is far from sexual. His jealous wife, who births children every year it seems, becomes increasingly jealous of the pretty Griet and the long hours she spends with Vermeer. The decadent, lusty old nobleman, a patron of Vermeer lusts after Griet and is reduced to the dirty old man villain type. The jealous wife too is another stock character. The master and servant relationship is also a bit outdated. While much of this can succumb to good old fashioned historical melodrama, it's really well-written and engaging.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|By far, one of Madonna's best albums to date.  I do say that about each album, but this is by far one of my Top 5 albums, cutting it close with \\"Music,\\" \\"American Life,\\" and \\"Like A Prayer.\\"  She did an AMAZING job with this.  She made a good choice in wanting to do an ALL dance album.  Here is my review, song by song: <br /> <br />Hung UP:  Very addictive.  When I got the single before it was released, I had it on repeat for hours, so now that I have the album, I'm a little worn on it, but it still makes me want to get up and dance.  It does seem a little repetitive, but still very catchy. <br /> <br />Get Together:  When I saw the tracklist before I heard the song, I thought to myself, oh please don't do a sequel to \\"Holiday\\"....  But totally caught me off-guard.  Very simple, yet fun song. <br /> <br />Sorry:  When I first listened to the whole album, this song grabbed me the first time listening.  EXCELLENT song.  I love her attitude in the lyrics.  Basically a \\"I'm not gonna put up with your sh*t\\" song.  This one also gets a little repetitive between chorus and verse in the middle, but is tastefully done. <br /> <br />Future Lovers:  Took me a bit to get into, but is very trance feeling.  Sounds like something that was mixed sometime between Ray Of Light and Music.   <br /> <br />I Love New York:  Ok, this is probably my least favorit track off the album.  The music is EXCELLENT to the song, but the lyrics are just horrible.  \\"Just go to Texas, isn't that where the golf?\\"  Come on Madonna, you're known for your tasteful lyrics.  But you eventually find yourself singing along to it anyway and enjoying yourself. <br /> <br />Let It Will Be:  I thought when I saw the tracklist, this would be my least favorite, just cause the title is a little odd to me.  But the song, i can't find the words.  I just want to get up and dance and rock out to it. <br /> <br />Forbidden Love:  A ballad turned disco.  Great song, vocals are excellent. <br /> <br />Jump:  Makes you do just what the title says, jump.  So energetic and inspiring lyrics. <br /> <br />How High:  To me, one of her most honest songs.  Simple, yet honest.  She admits to being selfish and basically a bitch, and wondering if it was worth doing what she did, but oh well, you did it, now you got what came with it. <br /> <br />Isaac:  You may be turned off by the foriegn singing, but it fits well with the song.  Starts off seeming like it might be slow, but you catch youself dancing in your seat and slapping your hands around to the beat. <br /> <br />Push:  Kind of the outcast of the album.  Sounds a little more, R&B/Pop instead of club/dance.  Still a great song. <br /> <br />Like It Or Not:  Basically, she's saying, I'm going to do whatever I want to do with my life, if you don't like it, oh well.  Love it. <br /> <br />Madonna said in an interview for Billboard that she usually likes the \\"remixes\\" of all her songs more than the original, so she wanted to skip the step of making an original and go right for a remixed sound.  GREAT idea.  That's what the album sounds like.  A bunch of club remixes of songs she's written. <br /> <br />If you go out and buy this album, you will not be disappointed.
B00012BD0S|5.0|By far the best symphony X album IMO (not that others are bad by any way shape or form).  This album is so energenic and powerpacked it is hard to find the correct words to describe.  This album starts with the more than excellent \\"of sin and shadows\\" and carries you through the most magical and exciting musical journey that you have ever taken.  Your journey will end on a high note with the extreemly beautiful and haunting song, \\"candlelight fantasia\\".  Symphony X is simply one of the most tallented band out there that nobody has heard of.  Do yourself a favor and BUY this album ASAP.  If you don't like it you simply donnot like  <br />music.

076790592X|5.0|Morrie Swartz is the man of my dreams and more.   <br /> <br />He is kind, compassionate, and above all a friend.  He had ALS, Lou Gehrik's a disease, a terrible disease where your body slowly shuts down bit by bit.  However, Morrie did not yield to the suffering so quickly.  He kept his spirits up for those around him; his wife, his family, and even one of his former students, Mitch Albom.  Together in this breathtaking novel, Morrie and Mitch take the reader on a journey of a lifetime, literally.  Morrie teaches Mitch about the true meaning of life and death through his own experiences, his own trials and tribulations.  He shows Mitch how important it is to live each and every day to the fullest, for life goes by as quick as lightning. <br /> <br />I have been deeply touched by Morrie and his love for everything in life.  He is so deep and rich and real.  Not many people are like Morrie and I learned that after reading this book.  People are not as emotionally open as he is.  He's a beautiful gold needle in a gigantic haystack.   <br /> <br />Once in a while, when I'm down and out and life just doesn't seem to be going the way I want it to, I'll remember Morrie.  I'll remember his words of wisdom and immense joy and laughter.  I'll remember how much he helped me realize that a life without LOVE is no life at all.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Greenday is so awful my word their music is just unlistinable. People say their sellouts i dont because they were never big enouf to be a sellout. Their music really sucks its kinda like if the backstreet boys got bored being a boy band and decided to take a stab at rock. Their lyrics just thrash the government thats not original bands were doing that since the 60's come on try something new my gosh. Even if you do like this band you wouldn't require this cd since their horrible music is ethier always on mtv are as i call \\"queer tv\\".
B00097DXZS|2.0|All the CD writing stuff aside, let's concentrate on the music.  Can you say take a good thing too far?  Supernatural was really good. Shamam was OK, but trending down.  Now 'pop' goes Santana.  What a horrible bunch of rubbish.  The songs with his band are OK, but nothing really new.  The duet with Stephen Tyler is the most restrained I've ever heard him.  The instrumental with Robert Randolph and Kirk Hammet is good, but way too short and it fades out at the end!  Los Lonely Boys add something, which saves it from one star.  But all this bubblegum, teenybopper pop er'  K-rap  can go.  Don't buy it.  You can have mine!
0786856297|5.0|Yes, the book has some obvious ties to the Harry Potter books. Including the fact that an adult can enjoy it, too! <br /> <br />Like the HP books most of the clues to the mystery are obvious to adults (as well as any person with a strong knowledge of Greek tales). But the journey the kids took was exciting and well crafted.  <br /> <br />I loved every minute of it and read the entire book in one sitting. It's the perfect diversion from the heavier stuff I have to read as a returning college student. <br /> <br />I highly recommend it!
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Enya has put forth a grand effort in that Amarantine is both daring and comfortable in one package. She and Nicky Ryan know how to balance their work incredibly well. How? While works such as \\"If I Could be Where You Are,\\" \\"Amid the Falling Snow,\\" and \\"A Moment Lost\\" do sound much like her previous masterpieces - they also venture into a different world with Loxian-language rich \\"Less Than a Pearl,\\" and \\"Water Shows the Hidden Heart.\\" I know nothing of the language from a Roma Ryan book, but it complements the works magnificently.  <br /> <br />The most daring piece in the line-up is definately \\"The River Sings\\". Also in Loxian, they have deftly weaved a Techno beat under the lyrics. <br /> <br />One suggestion I must make to all Enya fans, and even those who are quick to scribe harsh criticism of Amarantine...listen to the album several times. Because her songs are extremely complex, they may need several dedicated listenings for their beauty to reach your soul. She's done remarkably well in this effort to balance between her rich past and taking steps to an even bolder future.
B000BJS4SU|3.0|Before I give my review - I must state the premise that I am a huge John Mayer fan.  I think his first 3 solo albums were near perfectly crafted Pop albums, with Rock and Blues and sometimes Funk and Jazz sensibilities.  Earlier in his career John Mayer himself described his music in this way. <br /> <br />It is easy for musicians who are familiar with John Mayer to reduce his Pop career to No Such Thing, Your Body is a Wonderland, and ofcourse the dreaded Daughters.  It is easy for these same people to reduce John Mayer concerts to little more than a Gavin DeGraw show.  I however would like to use songs like 3x5, Back to You, Great Indoors, Come Back to Bed, Homelife, Only Heart, and Love Soon as examples of Mayers song writing prowless.  I would like to reference his live shows at college campuses from coast to coast as his solo performances. <br /> <br />When I refer to solo John Mayer I am referring to the above mentioned Mayer.....not Grammy nominee John Mayer.  SO now we have TRY !!!! - From Track 1 (Who Do You Think I Was) - wow what a metaphor - from Track 1 the Trio is Trying too hard -trying so hard to be the musicians's musicians.  I could tell this album was going to be very predictable from the onset.  First 3 Tracks can be one long jam track if they wanted it to be. <br /> <br />Gravity - this is one of the few times Mayer returns to form - so much so that anyone familiar with his solo career think they are getting an impromptu version of Come Back to Bed with this song. <br /> <br />Vultures - another song very reminiscent of Mayer prior to the Trio. <br /> <br />We drudge on through the album - ofcourse Mayer covers \\"I Got a Woman\\"  -been hanging out with Kanye recently huh John.   <br /> <br />The highlight of the album is Something's Missing - for one Mayer is not impersonating himself with the slurred delivery - he is actually enunciating the lyrics - secondly the crowd is actually into this song - and honestly he is just rocking this song. <br /><br />Daughters - Mayer has admitted on several occasions that he would not have chosen this song as a single off of Heavier Things, although he was appreciative of the Grammy nod it got.  So why is he rolling out once again? Come Back to Bed - an electic Love Soon, even a stripped down New Deep would've been much better choices for the Trio to cover. <br /> <br />There is no doubt an evident musical talent throughout this album - Steve Jordan is the drummer, what else can you say.  However, its just not fun to listen to.  Mayer is obviously extremely talented - but he did not move away from the hook of Pop music, he did away with it all together on this album. <br /> <br />I understand why this album was released as a Live effort - as it was easy to put the tracks together and get it out.  But Mayer's voice has fallen apart lately - he is almost a characture of himself with the raspy slur on every song - this could be because of the intricate guitar playing, but nonetheless its not fun to listen to.  Mayer has said that the Trio is able to cut studio tracks in one take - well you should've done that John - because this album falls short - only a couple times did I feel the emotion of the performance. <br /> <br />Reference 3x5 off the Any Given Thursday album to find Mayer at his live best.  Musicians will find tons of reasons to enjoy this album - but the Fan who wants to sing along, will feel lost.
0446577383|3.0|Baldacci is,without a doubt,A REALLY good story teller.This book is a good story.It's full of holes,unanswered questions and other irritations.Forget that though.Forget the fact that the book just stops,leaving you wanting more of what you feel you paid for.Forget all that and just go for the ride.He knows his territory.He'd obviously be the guy to ask for advice if you're stuck in a beltway clog.He has a pretty good grasp of some aspects of the power structure.If you loved his other books,you'll merely like this one.It definitely wasn't as satisfying as the last one.I don't regret reading it,but I sure hope the next one is up to the level he is capable of.As for liberal,left-wing slant,I think maybe some readers are a little too sensitive.If I really want left wing slant,I can go read Richard Clarke's new book,ugh.
B00000J2SQ|4.0|Straight Between The Eyes came out in 1982 and contains Rainbow's biggest hit, Stone Cold, a \\"power ballad\\" I have never gotten tired of hearing. This was Joe Lynn Turner's second album after the decent Difficult To Cure. The production is better and so are the songs. Highlights are the rockin Death Alley Driver (good chorus and solo), Tearin' Out My Heart (a ballad with great vocals), Power (upbeat rocker), Eyes Of Fire (mystical), and Stone Cold. Every Rainbow album including the last one, Stranger In Us All, has at least a few gems. If I had to choose the best three I would say Rainbow Rising, Straight Between The Eyes, and Bent Out Of Shape. I recommend Martin Popoff's latest book about Blackmore (English Castle Magic) if you can find it.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|Wow this guy is shrewd. He establishes a fan base, a radio airplay base, an economic base, then comes out gunslinging with his rock and roll soul. What a feat. I LOVE this album. I certainly like the softer \\"pop\\" side of John Mayer and have purchased his prior CDs on that basis. However, I am an absolute Hendrix/Vaughn/Winter/Duarte/Kravitz texas blues style guitar acolyte, and the stuff on this CD just blows me away, ESPECIALLY coming from John Mayer. Sad to see some reviewers rating the CD poorly based on the pop parameters they'd like to see JM bound by. On the other hand, I do think it's reasonable to warn the young teenaged girl fans out there that this album is a (fantastic) departure.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|This item has been reviewed a million times already, but I feel a need to add my two cents to this group of reviews.  I must simply say that this album is just raw.  It has an edge to it that other music rarely achieves, and is able to inspire emotion like no other. <br /> <br />I had never listened to Johnny Cash before this album, and may not listen to any other releases of his, but this album will be a mainstay in my collection for the rest of my life.  I was driving home from work one day, listening to a rock station, and a song came on.  I did not know who the artist was, but the song was familiar.  I managed to find out that it was Johnny Cash doing a rendition of \\"Hurt\\".  It was to say the least amazing, raw, emotion filled, and painful.  Despite being one of my favorite songs ever, it is not even in my opinion the best song on the album.   <br /> <br />Even if you don't like country music, I don't, this album is amazing, and most certainly worthy of the small price it costs to purchase.
B000B8QEZG|2.0|I was disappointed with this cd especially in light of the reviews I saw of it.
B000063DHL|4.0|Somewhere In Time came between what I consider to be the two best albums in the Iron Maiden catalog.  On this one, they use synthesizers for the first time, and for the most part it works.  Whereas the synthesizers became more a part of the main structure of the music on Seventh Son, on this album they're used mostly for texture. <br /> <br />Strip away the electronics, and you're left with good ol' fashioned Maiden:  Steve's propulsive, in-your-face bass, Dave and Adrian's guitars either in harmony or trading solos, Bruce's soaring voice and Nicko's drumming.  The band shared writing duties on this one more equitably than they did on past albums, although there's not a single writing credit for Bruce. <br /> <br />As for the songs, my favorites are the first two, \\"Caught Somewhere In Time\\" and \\"Wasted Years\\".  Pretty much all the material here is good, but I have to take a couple points off \\"Alexander The Great\\"; the music is terrific, but the lyrics read like an encyclopedia entry.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|Bruce's best album- period. Plus a making of dvd and a live concert dvd from 1975. All for under 30 dollars. Buy it even if you have the orginal cd.<br /><br /> The album- best songs are Thunder Road, Born to Run (one of the greatest songs of all time), Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out, and Backstreets. This is an eight song record that's lowest point is the interesting Meeting Across the River.
B000BM6AVA|4.0|If you like a mixture of heavy metal, alternative, and politics, then this is for you. <br /> <br />System of a down is a superior band with a unique sound.  They tend to be 'left of center' in their lyrics, but they're not pushy like 'rage against the machine' is.  Just suggestive lyrics now and then about current issues. <br /> <br />I liked Mezmerize better... it had catchier lyrics and just sounded a little better (so I give this 4 stars). <br /> <br />Still, they come through once again with their trademark sound, song style, and lyrics. A+ <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Nearly everyone I work with has been raving about this TV show since it came out on DVD.  I personally thought it seemed kind of hokey loooking and since I didn't recognize even a single actor except for Adam Baldwin (Animal Mother from Full Metal Jacket) I thought it must just be one of those cult movies that only a few people really like and I must work with them. <br /> <br />I was completely wrong. <br /> <br />This TV show has everything that every other show tries to have.   <br /> <br />- Great well rounded characters <br />- Great acting <br />- Better special effects than many Hollywood movies <br />- Great storylines and writing <br />- Great dialogue that is also quite risque (they basically take things about as far as you can in this country) <br /> <br />Anyway, if you get the time, watch this series.  Well worth it.
B000B8QEYC|4.0|An avid fan of Enya and this album is good but I can not say it edged me into bliss like \\"A Day Withou Rain\\" or quite as good as \\"Watermark\\" and \\"Shepard Moons\\".<br /><br />\\"It's in the Rain\\" this is a fun track.  \\"The River Sings\\" just makes you want to get up dance around in wonderful array of flower petals in meadows. \\"Long Long Journey\\" does well too.<br /><br />\\"Sumiregusa\\" (Wild Violet) is Japanese haiku graciously extended in the CD from an abrupt online sample (due to a mishap with Panasonic). It is one of her better slower ballads.<br /><br />\\"Someone Said Goodbye\\", \\"A Moment Lost\\" and \\"Drifting\\" are rather morose melodramas especially with the latter.  You can just feel the tears falling down her face with this track inspired by the dark viola and bass samples.<br /><br />This is an album for the Enya faithful and perhaps it may grow on me, but for now, I thank Enya for giving us something new.  I do hope that this is not her last.
0201721481|5.0|Don't let the title fool you. The \\"primer\\" in the title refers to those who need a primer in C++ and not those who need a primer in programming. Even so, this book is best suited for someone who has a C++ background from texts such as those by Deitel, Tony Gaddis, Walter Savitch, or Ivor Horton. Note also that there are NO SOLUTIONS for any of the problems - most other college texts at least have limited solutions for students. Ultimately, this text is best used as a reference to accompany some other text that is actually meant for students and not working programmers.
B00000255F|5.0|Don't buy this unless you are cheap or are not a big Brice fan. Buy the more expensive remastered box set instead. See my reviews for a review of the box set which features a review of the album itself.
B000BM6AVA|4.0|First off, 95% of nu-metal sucks, other than maybe soad, slipknot and flaw still hold my attention. This is an album worthy of 4 stars. Serj is a great vocalist. However, Daron YOU SUCK as a singer. I've been a fan since the \\"System of a Down\\" album. Which is classic, along with Toxicity. The lyrics have also lost alot of serious value. It is alot of goofy and corny type stuff now. Which is alright but can  get obnoxious at times. Also, I am not one to act holier than thou if I have been listening to a band longer than a few others. However, it is REALLY annoying to hear people who have only heard this album talk like they know everything about SOAD. So, please stop it. Song's like Kill Rock N' Roll, Hypnotize, Tentative, U-Fig, and Soldier Side make this album really good in fact. However song's like Lonely day (What is worse, Daron's vocals or his sappy cheese filled lyrics?) just bring the album down. If you are new to soad and are impressed with this album, check out \\"System of a Down\\" and \\"Toxicity\\" to really be blown away. Also, look at the song \\"She's like Heroin\\" Serj's parts are great and make the song listenable,, then Daron's singing is just God awful. Seriously, who gave this guy a mic? I would have given this album 5 stars if Serj had done all the vocal's. I do recommend this album though, as long as you can deal with Daron's vocals. Enjoy.
B000BKDOCA|5.0|This REMIX album from BRITNEY SPEARS is TOTALLY HOT! I personally think its one of the best, if not THE BEST Remix album EVER! She totally knows how to get people moving! Once you pop this in, its all night long partying. This cd would make a great addition to any up and coming DJ's and or people just wanting to go out and club or party! ITS AMAZING! I give it 5 stars! Thanks Britney for holding us over with this while we wait for your next album! :)
B000B8QEZG|5.0|'Confessions on a Dance Floor' is Madonna's newest album and a breath of fresh air to the abyssmally depressing top 40 charts. (Hilary Duff, Lindsay Lohan, Black Eyed Peas....make it stop) This album is equal parts disco, dancing, electronica and a little trance with a hint of Middle Eastern influences thrown in as well.    The first single off this album, 'Hung Up', caught my attention IMMEDIATELY. I.....LOVE..... THIS..... SONG!!!! Words cannot express my need to get up and shake something when I hear this song. (ABBA sample is f&*king BRILLIANT!!!)    The rest of the album is not the pure electronified-disco bliss of 'Hung Up', but is solid all the same. There are definite highlights and the occasional bland spot, but all in all I've become a Madonna fan over the last 24 hours. Not kidding.    Overall, this album doesn't get the full 5 stars because the first single set my expectations in the clouds and even though I knew the whole album probably wouldn't be as phenomenal as the first single, I still really wanted it too.     So, 4.5 stars for a GREAT release from Madonna. Definite buy.
B000000ZGO|3.0|After Isaac released his first album in 1967 he shifted gears, and went from more of a jazz sound to more of a soul sound. Without a doubt he knew how to straddle the soul sound of the 60's and make it palatable for the 70's. He showed alot of genius here with a solid cover of the song \\"Walk On By\\". I'm now convinced there is no \\"Bad\\" version to this song as I've heard 2 other versions besides this one. Of course I'm talking about Dionne Warwick's, and Long Island's The Outcasts. He also does a good version of I guess this to be an original \\"One Woman\\", Then there's the transistion of the song \\"By The Time I Get To Phoenix\\". I feel Isaac did a very awesome job with this, and the style sounds like it would inspire Ike and Tina Turner to do the same with \\"Proud Mary\\" two years later, but I feel that \\"By The Time I Get To Phoenix\\" is a break-up song, and this is something I can't stomach. I would say the same thing about Glen Campbell's version too; What we put ourselves through for the sake of loving someone else. I happen to feel the man was wrong for assumming that the woman wanted fancy things; if that's what he did. I got that message from the song. I could be wrong, but yes a woman wants to know that a man will be responsible, and dilligent, but she also knows that his circumstances may not be all that good with a low-paying job, and so as a couple they must be able to talk this out, and not think that well the way to win a woman is through the wallet. That's sexually harassing, and very prejudical. There's no way that a man, and for that matter a woman should put themselves through that because it only ends up to where they are so hard, bitter, and unfeeling that they end up alone. I can only say for all you couples out there make sure you're falling, or are in love for each other for the right reasons, and not to make someone into something for yourself...e.g. A woman turning her boyfriend into her father's persona, or A Man making her girlfriend into a femalecelebrity because he doesn't want to give up the lustful feelings he has. To walk away 8 times, and come back that's pathetic; for both of you. You shouldn't have gotten together in the first place, and then the world wouldn't have to suffer through a real tear-jerker like this one. Mind you we all need to have a good cry every now and then, but make sure it's not because of a self-destructing pattern; because once the tears are through the next move will be suicide. Well enough of that I've pretty much exorcised my hard depressed feelings for the song, and once again it's not because Isaac did it, but the song is terrible. The other song I can't even pronounce let alone tolerate, so I'll just leave to this that it's the worst song on this album. It's not quite there to being a classic, but kudos to Isaac for being bold enough to take the step.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|This album is another brilliant piece of work by System of a Down.  This album is reccomended to anyone that likes to hear good SOAD music and every fan of the band should be required to own this masterpiece.
B00007M5CO|5.0|As today's pop music has become a senseless industry, where one hit albums is all that you can find, it's always good to find out that there is an alternative.  As an avid music fan, I was looking for something different and then I found out this CD. I was amazed by the latin influences of tango and electronica mixed together which resulted in this great offering. Well, this got me into lounge music and his multiple varieties and I haven't stopped listening to it since then. This is powerful music and has a great feeling; if you are into something different than the same pop music that is played in every single radio station and want to discover the fascinating world of lounge, try it, you won't regret it.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|This album is the second half of the Mezmerize/Hypnotize album. (recorded at the same time just released several months later) I felt this was a good move because the CD's are quite different thematically and it takes awhile for the music to \\"sink\\" in rather than be bombarded with too much at once.  <br /> <br />The cd itself is an excellent addition to System's repretoire. Since I've been following them since the start, and I've seen a rather drastic evolution within the band. Musically, they have remained relatively the same throughout their albums. We get the same mix of hard metal/rock and slow/melodic songs to complement them. The lyrics, have however, changed for the better. There is more meaning and depth to them than there ever has been (especially with Hypnotize) In my opinion, this is the first System of a Down cd with a central theme, something I enjoy very much while listening to music. <br /> <br />Darron's (guitarist/song writer) role in singing had been rather reserved on the first three albums (SOAD,Toxicity,Steal this Album) but played an equal role as Serj (main singer) on Mezmerize. It worked on some levels, but I prefer Serj as a singer, he seems to have better range and performance. With this second half, Darron's voice is much less heard and only comes in when it is appropriate rather than what seemed to be pushed too much in Mezmerize. As far as the songs go, (these are only my interpretations) <br /> <br />1. Attack: Very hard and fast track, dealing with the loss of human identity and importance to the machines and government. It refers to the breaking point of mankind being reached and stresses the importance of togetherness in times of crisis. <br /> <br />2. Dreaming: This is another heavy \\"traditional\\" System song that , thematically, is almost a continuation of Attack and it mentions the fact that as one mankind cannot accomplish anything it is only by working together. It takes a state of altered consciousness (Dream) and makes it seemthat even in that state, the horrors of life still exist. Quite the pessimistic song. <br /> <br />3. Kill Rock 'N Roll: This song has kind of a Spanish feel to it and works really well within this album. It reminds me of Cigaro off of Mezmerize. It's essentially a song apoligizing for \\"killing rock and roll\\"-as in squandering freedom and all it represents. It also sends the message to enjoy life to its fullest \\"Eat all the grass that you want\\" because \\"accidents\\" can happen at any time <br /> <br />4. Hypnotize: This title track is quite a different approach to a System of a Down song. It's basically a monologue. It refers sarcastically to the rebellions at Tiananmen Square and deals, again sarcastically, with sweatshop labor as \\"the reason they were there\\" <br /> <br />5. Stealing Society: Quite a fast, upbeat intro that quickly turns into a grisly tale of civil war. Not in the traditional sense, though, it's more of a civil war of humanity versus humanity not say certain ethnicities within one nation. Referring to the ones fighting as the Suns and Skies, something we all share, and the overall pointlessness.  <br /> <br />6. Tentative: All System albums have one song with a really awesome riff in them, and this seems to be the song for this album. (War?, X, Question!) This is a continuation of the theme stating that not even God will be able to save us from this downward spiral that we have built. It asks \\"where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall\\" discussing the civilian issues of warfare <br /> <br />7. U-Fig: This is another excellent song, very innovative. A real variety of riffs and types of singing. It is about violent nationalists. (Probably the Americans and the suicide bombers equally) It sarcastically says how important it is to come to the sky and come join the cause but also refers to the pathetic flag waving ignorant pigs so is a very unbiased opinion. (Americans) <br /> <br />8. Holy Mountains: This song is indescribably good. If you don't buy this album, at least download this song from Itunes or something. It is a hypnotic (fittingly) unique System song that mixes chanting with hard riffs and metal. It speaks about a simple minded leader who leads the people and decides what is right and wrong with one word. (Words the people must follow) It also Refers to the \\"River Aras\\", which is a 600 mile long river bordering Armenia. It is implying this is the safe place to go and where we are free. It stresses the stupidity of borders within nations and that we should ideally all be one. <br /> <br />9. Viscinity of Obscenity: This is the traditional \\"nonsense\\" song (On the surface) on this System Cd <br />(Jet Pilot, Sugar, IEAIAIO, TCMMFLIOTS) and it is a very good song with a good beat and interesting instrumentals dealing with how people thrive off those less fortunate and look down on them.  <br />(Think of how you treat fast food employees, for example) <br /> <br />10. She's like Heroin: This is a song referring to people as commodities that cannot be accepted unless they take a traditional role in society. (It deals with the intolerant nature of most people) <br /> <br />11. Lonely Day: This is a slow song sung mostly by Darron and it deals with humanity wanting to bottle up its problems rather than expose them and attempt to get help. However, it does offer hope in that, \\"this time\\" he survived. It teaches us not to keep our emotions to ourself and to share them with someone else to prevent this from happening  <br /> <br />The period of transition is very well done between song 11/12 as it is the same sound between Soldier Side Intro and BYOB off the first cd, kicking it off however this moves into a slower song, <br /> <br />12. Soldier Side: Unlike the intro, this one is done with both singers in harmony. It is a slow, hard song. It is an extremely powerful song referring to God as \\"wearing black\\". A symbol of absolute good has seemingly given up. It also talks about the fact that the manipulativenature of humans inevitably leads to pain and suffering. The ideals of Christianity seem to be gone and \\"never coming back\\" It then breaks and leads into the part of the Soldier side intro \\"welcome to the soldier side...where there's no one here but me...People all grow up to die.\\" except it is sung by both and it is a bit harder. It is an excellent ending to an excellent album. <br /> <br />This album presents an optimistic beginning, representing the \\"potential\\" of mankind but quickly dives into a darker reality except for a few key lines throughout some of the songs that counteract the solid pessimism. It ends up being the ideals that humans need to stay as one will never be accomplished as people are concerned only with their self interest. It even goes as far to say that God Himself has given up. <br /> <br />I highly reccomend this album despite its dark outlook. A better description would be a REAL outlook, not one that has been sugar coated to suit our happy needs. In all senses, this is a masterpiece
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Posle remek dela albuma American Life koji nam je Madonna pruzila, album Confession On A Dance Floor je korak unazad, ako ne zvuci pregrubo jer u principu Confession je sasvim zadovoljavajuce izdanje, ali M. nas je navikla na pruzanje uvek neceg novog, a ovaj album novo nista nije doneo. <br />I glavno pitanje je koje za to kriv! Stuart Price ili Madonna? Mozda cak krivca treba traziti i u Mirwais? <br />Ono sto je sigurno da ovaj album nema pesmu koja ce trajati vecno kao mnoge M. pesme osim Hung Up i eventualno Push i I Love New York, ako budu singlovi. <br />Ovaj album M. vraca u '80 kada nijedan njen album osim Like A Prayer nije imao koncept.  <br />Dakle i koncept je problem albuma. <br />Ali... <br />Madonna nam je u svojoj bogatoj karijeri dala vec tri remek dela, Like A Prayer, Ray Of light i American Life, mozda je previse ocekivati cetvrto. <br />Sa Greate M. se nikada ne zna! <br /> <br />Hung Up 5/5 <br />Get Together 5/5 <br />Sorry 4/5 <br />Future Lovers 3/5 <br />I Love New York 5/5 <br />Let It Will Be 5/5 <br />Forbidden Love 4/5 <br />Jump 4/5 <br />How High 4/5 <br />Isaac 5/5 <br />Push 5/5 <br />Like It Or Not 5/5 <br />
B000002NE4|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful, heart-ache-inducing albums I've ever heard.  Nick Cave will have you in tears by the end of it - and rightfully so.  It's simply a masterpiece.
B0002OERI0|4.0|Sometimes, lots of exposure can be a good thing. Othertimes, it's just overkill. Unless you have been living under a rock for the past year, you already know half of this album even if you're one of the few who havn't bought it yet. If you HAVE bought it, you know it's kind of hard to stomach the singles. It's a shame too because they are all pretty good songs. <br /> <br />Green Day finally grew up with this album. They may have showed signs of it in the past but now they have finally crossed the rubicon. Musical maturity is pretty much innevitable if your a band with listening to. Unfortunately, though the songs are all strong for the most part, the band seems to have lost some of whatever made them \\"fun\\" back in 1994 when they gained millions of new fans. <br /> <br />I also don't care what anyone says, I think Green Day were a punk band. Yes, I said it. But however much punk they may have been, they have lost it here. It's not a bad thing, I'm just saying. Naturally some of the songs still have punk overtones in both musical and lyrical content but they are more of just a straight up rock band now. And again, that's not a BAD thing its just different for them. This is a concept album meaning it has a continuous thread linking all of the songs together to a story line very much in the vein of the Who's \\"Tommy\\" (which Billie has pretty much cited as one of his inspirations). <br /> <br />With songs like \\"American Idiot\\" and \\"She's A Rebel\\", Green Day prove they can still write short, catchy pop punk songs. However, with songs like \\"Jesus Of Suburbia\\" (which is a 9 minute rock opera, undoubetdly one of the bands greatest achievements) and even \\"Give Me Novocain\\", they prove they are not afraid to branch out and try new things. My favorite is probably \\"Letterbomb\\". Great song. <br /> <br />This is Green Day's most ambitious album to date and I think in the future we might see them achieving legendary status. In my mind, their already there. If your a new, casual, orold Green Day fan...you can't really go wrong with this album. Although, sometimes when listening to this album its easy to long for tunes in the vein of \\"Basket Case\\" or \\"Nice Guys Finish Last\\".
B000007638|5.0|This CD blows away the Tripping the live fantastic and Paul is live CDs away. The Paul Mccartney Band 1989-1993 <br />were a bunch of boring ass musicians. Wings 1975-1978 could really rock and this CD will confirm that. Highly recommend. <br />Pauls present band also can rock, Back in the Us. is also great. <br />JUst stay away from the wussie 90\\"s band. enough said buy this CD now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B000BW7QWW|4.0|First of all, I had only seen one episode of the TV series when I saw this movie, and was expecting little more than a distracting action-filled romp. However, I was surprised to encounter excellent dialogue, a unique storyline, and nearly all the epic Space Opera goodness you could want. Also, this movie had humor. Sure, some of the jokes were a little lame, but for the most part, they were amusing, and the movie manages to employ even the most predictable one liners in manner James Bond could only hope to achieve. Though certainly not a revolution for the genre, Serenity was still an excellent movie that kept me entertained and enthralled throughout.  <br /> <br />P.S.: I have bo idea whats up with the cover art for the DVD. It features scenes that didn't happen and a completely different actress than the one featured in the movie. Perhaps it's merely a concept rendition from an earlier age.
0767821629|2.0|It's just another american \\"who done it\\" murder mystery. A software specialist jumps between the past and present, trying to find who commited murders. It doesn't occur to him that he commited the murders himself. There are some special effects in the form of green laser lights. And the ending shows nice scenery, supposedly from the year 2024. The movie makes time travel back to 1937. I wish it travelled into the future more, instead of travelling to the past. All in all, it was a horrifying movie filled with killings and not much else.<br /><br />I give it an extra star for the pleasant happy end.

B00005JO1P|5.0|This is a film for everyone, but especially for the Baby Boomers.  Baby Boomers lived through the career of Johnny Cash and will experience the feeling that they are seeing history in the making.  I know you should be quiet in the theatre, but I kept leaning over to my college-aged son and saying, \\"I remember this.\\" and \\"Do you know who THAT person is?\\" etc.  Part way through the film, I stopped leaning over, because I was secretly wiping tears from my eyes.  This film is extremely powerful.  There are films you rent, and films you watch in the theatre, and films you plop down hard earned money for the privilege of owning.  This film is worth owning.<br /><br />Now realize, these are the words of a Baby Boomer here.  My son is of a different generation.  As we left the theatre I asked him, \\"Well, what did you think?\\"  His response, \\"It's probably as good as Harry Potter.\\"  Wow!  I guess this may be a film for all ages.<br /><br />ONE REQUEST . . . To Whom it May Concern:  Johnny Cash had a LOT of life (perhaps the best part) AFTER his marriage to June Carter.  If anyone chooses to make a sequel to this film, I'll be there.  This film is good, but it is only part A of what should be a two-parter.
B000BKDOCA|5.0|A new album by Britney Spears. Ok, these are just remixes but that's great because it's a excellent album. I'm not complaining but some unreleased tracks would make this album perfect. Tracks like \\"Mona Lisa\\", \\"Over To You Now\\" or \\"Guilty\\" would have been great. Or more remixes would have been great too. But hey, we have another Britney record. I'm enjoying this record very much and it's a must have for all the Britney fans and for all the people that like to shake their ass.
B000005RT8|5.0|\\"McCartney II\\" was recorded in 1980 right after Paul disbanded Wings. Like his first solo album, \\"McCartney II\\" is another stripped down, at home, McCartney-only production, \\"McCartney II\\" finds Paul in a rather experimental-possibly drug-induced-state. McCartney explores synth-pop here a year before it blew up in the pop-market. Taking a cue from artists like Kraftwerk, Devo and Brian Eno, \\"McCartney II\\" has everything from New Wave spaz-outs (\\"Temporary Secretary\\"), ambient/folk ballads (\\"Waterfalls\\") and paranoid techno ditties (\\"Darkroom\\"). Plus, there is funky and ebullient pop (\\"Coming Up\\"). Sadly, \\"McCartney II\\" marked the end of the Wings era in the same manner \\"McCartney\\" marked the end of The Beatles era. But also like \\"McCartney\\", \\"McCartney II\\" is a charmingly oddball album. And even though he was following the path of techno pioneers, McCartney managed, through his raw production and mixing of real instruments, to create an album that's far less dated than other, colder techno albums from the time-period. It often sounds like the low-fi electronica from 1990s indi-rock acts. Early Stereolab springs to mind. Like two other unsung gems, \\"Wild Life\\" and \\"Back to the Egg\\", \\"McCartney II\\" was snarled at by the critics. However, there was one cat who praised it in 1980: John Lennon. He even cited the \\"Coming Up\\" single as inspiring him out of retirement and to record what would be his final album, \\"Double Fantasy\\" (a FAR more conservative recording than \\"McCartney II\\"). Overall, \\"McCartney II\\" is a great album for those who like funky, witty, homespun, experimental pop-music with a rock & roll edge. Those interested in the album should definitely get the import CD with extra tracks. Especially for the extra track \\"Secret Friend\\": an atmospheric ambient/trance song. It's such a beautiful piece of music and really shows McCartney's stylistic range.
B00005JO17|5.0|My kids and I LOVED chicken little. It had us laughing through the whole movie. Very Cute. I recommend this one as a family movie.
B00005JOHI|5.0|I saw an advanced screening of this film in Boston and was very pleased, it is intelligent in its handle of the material and its fluency in cinematic crafting. Goodbye to dusty, \\"precious\\" interpretations of Jane Austen. This cheeky, poetic, even dark new film makes the story youthful with down-to-earth vibrancy and worship of emotion. Here are young people making the mistakes and dreaming the dreams of the young (when it was written it wasn't antiquity, it was life). Lizzie is not a smirking omniscient but a quick witted independent; hotheaded and fiercely loyal to her sister. She is wary of an unfair world and uses her wits to survive. Darcy is not an impenetrable stoic but a shy sensitive soul with high unwieldy social pretensions fending off the outside world. And they are both lonely and have big yearning hearts, so the filmmakers made one great decision -- they let them fall in love the first moment they lock eyes. In a shot we see hearts behind fortified personalities and an instant chemistry that takes a movie's worth of battling with each other and themselves to right itself. It's an earthy move that sets the tone for a film about the people and world behind the antiquated manners, a world not so different from ours.    Now set in 1797, when Austen wrote the first draft of the book, the filmmakers committed to main plot points and themes, and astutely represent the Romantic Age and Austen's characters.  The love between Jane and Lizzie is supreme and fuels a desire in Lizzie to tear at Darcy when he separates Jane from Mr. Bingley. She's hurt, she reciprocates the pain, and it is bitter.  Pride and prejudices are drawn clearly: Lizzie searches hard to find fault with Darcy, and Darcy cannot bring himself to let down his guard. Both have their reasons justified, but they foil their own chances at love constantly until they see how wrong they are and are too heartsick to keep going. Class conflict is suddenly personally injurious and vicious. When Charlotte Lucas marries for security, it's a grave matter and she must bitingly sober up a disdainful Lizzie on the realities of their world. The Bennets are too eccentric and improper for their own good. Lady Catherine (Dame Judi Dench, who is downright fearsome) is not just a cold figure for Lizzie to spar with, but someone capable of deeply hurting others. The filmmakers are savvy in their understanding of history. Setting it back 20 years is a remarkable move, because we accept more diversions and variation with the 18th century than the 19th and it presents Austen as a Romantic, which automatically requires the story to be interpreted from a different, very legitimate, perspective. The ideals of the Romantic Age are ingeniously, subtly played here: human equality, gritty realism married with beauty for the sake of beauty, but a beauty which is never elitist or decadent, always grounded, simple, and universal: nature, the human being, emotion.    The ensemble and mis-en-scene are electric. The camera spryly edges in and out of rooms and conversations instead of sitting arthritically in a corner. The dance scenes are less about ballet, now rollicking and spirited as characters send signals, flirt, deflect and analyze one another. In true Romantic form (worthy of filling Wordsworth with pride) the aesthetic unabashedly revels in beauty, but always the simple joys of our world: sunrises, dewy landscapes in wide shots, colors everywhere. It has a lovely score, period inspired and without any pomp and circumastance. Simple blocking is caffeinated and given substance, something is always going on in the background. Lively, layered interactions between characters make rich scenes, neither wasting space nor time. Consider a scene with Mr. Collins, played by the magnificent Tom Hollander (a standout here, so delightfully weird. When he jaggedly squirms his way up to someone you want to shriek). He wants to speak to Lizzie, alone, and a bolt of fear strikes through her as she pleadsin vain not to be abandoned. The sisters are merciless, Mrs. Bennet delighted, Mr. Bennet at a loss, and Collins prepares. It's all silent and it's hysterical.     Suggesting variation to revered characters is a frightful task, but here it's a revelation. The entire cast is brilliant, but the two leads are transcendent in their roles. Keira Knightley is charismatic, random, wonderfully young, intuitive to the bone -- she inhabits Lizzie. Matt MacFadyen is deep, remarkably subtle, but mostly he is soulful. I've long held him as a sympathetic actor, but he shines in this.  The two instill an unexpected exuberance of feeling in their performances.  Neither ever acknowledge the camera exists and make the most of every second they have on screen to project their characters. When you throw them together you get a love story full of emotional subtext, double meaning, and gloriously heavy moments.    Because so much dialogue was cut, simple lines have impact and much of the exposition is visual. Epic little moments linger and rain, revealing souls. The thoughts and intentions behind the actors' eyes and words are visible at all times.  This movie understands the power of a shot or glance. Lizzie comes to understand Darcy in how he embraces his sister or smiles (a momentous occasion, indeed). When she talks about love it's stirring because it's finally spilled into the open after we've seen it near the edge many times with half said sentiments and stifled tears. Usually \\"I love you\\" comes with extra explanatory prose, but here sincerity kills clich: parties are fun, a misty field is breathtaking, the dawning of love a revelation, the heartbreak is throbbing.     It's a brilliant film. There is something breathless and luminous about it, from its youth and the break from propriety, to the beauty and spontaneity of life and romance, pain and joy, which provide the color.

0393317552|4.0|This book is long, detailed and at some points very boring. There is so much information in here that its tough to pass up. You will read on about points the author is trying to make that are dull and insignificant, then you will come to a part that becomes so interesting you wont want to put it down. How the Spaniards conquered Mexico, how the Indians were making the same progress as the Europeans but almost 500 years behind them. How the shape of the continents effected the progress of civilization. How the lack of written word crippled those who had yet to develope it. This will answer your questions on why some parts of the world were able to adapt and develop much faster then others. If you stick with this book till the end you won't regret what you will have learned.
0739308742|4.0|I too knew what to expect with this book as far as limited character viewpoints and some new viewpoints-I actually enjoyed the new viewpoints. I can see where some people might compare the lack of \\"stupendous action\\" to Jordans last few, but I also know Mr. Martin is trying to make time pass a little faster in this book to reflect 5 years of time passing. He's setting us up for some big whammies. <br /> <br />My biggest complaint is in the audiobook itself. When I preordered it, Amazon showed that the book was read by Roy Dotrice. SURPRISE!! It's not. <br /> <br />If you've listened to the first 3 audiobooks, then you know that Mr. Dotrice has probably done some of the best readings of ANY audiobook reader. I drive for a living and listen to audiobooks constantly, I've listened to well over 500.  <br /> <br />Roy gave many of the characters accents and vocal characteristics that were incredible as well as easy to discern-and he maintained them through all the books. I can't describe to you how well mastered his voices worked with Mr. Martin's characters. Grab a  Game of Thrones audio and give a listen-you'll understand. <br /> <br />So as far as the story-pretty good, waiting for the other half. As far as the audiobook...flat, plain...total dissappointment. The reader John Lee isn't horrible by any means, but he just doesn't \\"Do it\\". <br /> <br />Dave Ferreira <br />Coventry, RI

B00009RDGA|5.0|Producer and director Peter Bogdanovich created a visually stunning panorama of sprawling Midwestern landscapes with some marvelous black and white cinematography in his excellent comedic drama \\"Paper Moon\\".  The inseparable tandem of Ryan and Tatum O'Neal were naturals as the scam artist team traveling the backroads of Depression era Kansas.  Nine year old Tatum O'Neal was particularly outstanding in her role as Addie Loggins, paving uncharted waters as the youngest ever recipient of an Academy Award.<br /><br />In a benevolent moment, Ryan O'Neal, playing Moses Pray, a small time con man offered to transport the recently orphaned Addie to her aunt's house in St. Joseph, Missouri.  Along the way Pray discovers that Addie's skills in the con game surpass his own.  They commence successfully working as a team bilking suckers along the way to St. Joe.  They encounter a colorful cast of characters along the way, most notably Madeline Kahn playing dancer/hooker Trixie Delight.  Mose rescues her from a carnival and she begins travelling with them.  She soon begins to compete with Addie for Mose's attention.  In a wittily conceived scene Addie cooks up a scheme to make Mose dump Ms. Delight.<br /><br />Bogdanovich does an exemplary job in capturing the somber and naive mood of Midwestern America in the mid-30's.  He skillfully guides his characters across this landscape, allowing them to create minor mayhem along the way.

B000002VC3|5.0|This is the best album by The Alan Parsons Project. I mean, you gotta fall for Silence And I, the best song ever written by Alan Parsons. The album is very melodic and gives me a strange feel, which Pyramid didn't. The songs are all well, and I can hardly say more then I highly recommend it to every Pop-fan, listen this, and you'll feel blessed.

B000BM6AVA|4.0|\\"Attack\\" rockets off during most of the song with explosive guitaring and drumming.  Daron, the main guitarist and one of the two main vocalists, takes a backseat in this song as Serj (the main vocalist) highlights the song with his vocals taking up most of the song. \\"Dreaming\\" is a mess of tempo, drumming, vocals, guitaring...you name it, System Of A Down will throw it into this song.  Typical SOAD material, though.  The ending, however, is full of duets of SOAD's vocalists, which, to be honest, is alright. \\"Kill Rock 'N Roll\\" is a sort-of-quieter piece, until Daron tries to yell until Serj sort-of-helps him with a yelling/singing duet throughout the refrain.  The lyrics are a bit weird, especially in Daron's solo part during the middle. This song sounds better live, however. <br /> <br />Then there's the title track, \\"Hypnotize\\".  A quieter piece from the first three, which, in sense, gives the listener a break from the edgy and heavy pieces that laces the record. I personally liked this song after a few listens, but it can grow a bit old after a while.  \\"Stealing Society\\" returns the craziness and a lot of profanity. Daron's parts near the end of the record could turn off a few listeners.  \\"Tentative\\" is an average song. Not much to say about it, to be honest. You might like it, you might not. <br /> <br />\\"U-Fig\\" is some nice SOAD material.  Weird lyrics with Serj yelling, then, along with Daron, making some weird noises in the refrain.  \\"Holy Mountains\\" has to be the best track on here. The singing is top notch, and it might make older SOAD listners remember about \\"Aerials\\" from Toxicity. <br /> <br />Then the weirdness takes over.  \\"Vicinity Of Obscenity\\" is a big turnoff unless you want to hear some of the strangest SOAD material ever conducted ever since the self-titled material and Toxicity.  A summary of this record: Serj, children, elevator music, a giant rabbit, and Daron all running around different genres while a man yells \\"SEIZURESEIZURESEIZURE\\". \\"She's Like Heroin\\" bleeds from the previous track.  This song is not as strange, the lyrics must of been created while someone was intoxicated. <br /> <br />\\"Lonely Day\\" is a nice piece, however.  It might be the only time that Daron made a peaceful song. This will be a favorite. <br /> <br />\\"Soldier Side\\" is the connecting piece of the Hypnotize/Mezmerize piece.  Unlike the intro of the first album of the duo, this song starts quieter.  The entire tempo of the song speeds up throughout the song until the end, where there song crushes with great guitar riffs and both vocalists singing their best.  The perfect ending to a duo. <br /> <br />The entire record skips around, a hard piece here, a softer piece here.  Like every System Of A Down album before it, and like the other album in the duo, Hypnotize will be well loved by fans and the media.
B0009R1T7M|1.0|Astoundingly overrated, Stevens is a weak singer-songwriter who sounds here like a pastiche of James Taylor and Brian Wilson at their very worst. Lyrical conceits fall flat, and the overtones of born-again-ness are teeth-grating. The tunes are lackadaisical, half-composed at best. Nothing here has any energy, and I can't detect any real emotion or commitment here.<br /><br />I am at a loss to explain why this collection of mediocre-to-bad songs, performed and sung with a half-a$$ed attitude and no energy, has gotten so many good reviews from so many people. There is absolutely nothing here. Buying this is like buying a blank CD.
B000002U9Y|4.0|Saucerful Of Secrets, released in 1968, is Pink Floyd second studio album.    The band didn't have an easy time back then - its leader and main songwriter, Syd Barrett, left the band because of his drug addiction. David Gilmour replaced him, but Pink Floyd didn't know what to do - without Barrett setting the band's musical direction, they were kinda lost. This is where Roger Waters shined. He mobilizated the band to work and wrote main part of material for the album.    As the result, We've got Pink Floyd psychodelic masterpiece. This album is slightly different from their debut - atmosphere of the songs is dark, mysterious, and more... mature in compare to their first album. Let There Be More Light is a great heavy psychodelic opener with stellar aura about it; Remember A Day is leftover from Piper At Gates... and is very fine Rick Wright composition, sounding somewhat peaceful, but still giving the thrills... impressive. Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun is haunting, dark and mysterious - led by a strong bass riff, with a jamming part in the middle. Waters uses chinese poetry as lyrics to this song. An early Pink Floyd classic.  Corporal Clegg is really wierd. It changes its style to often, and it just doesn't work. I consider this and See-Saw as weakest points of the album.  Saucerful Of Secrets is crazy psychodelia at its best - it starts with haunting, piercing sounds and noises - the atmosphere is growing, growing - suddenly it's silence - then comes the awesome drum beat and Gilmour's guitar cries and Wright hits random notes on his piano. After this crazy jamming comes the most beautiful moment in PF music. The choir at the end makes You feel like You're... somewhere in the space. This is one of the best, and most original songs ever.  Unfortunately, the album slips a bit here - See-Saw, as I mentioned before, is the album lowlight. Really lame thing, it sounds like just a bunch of chords put together. I'm sorry, but I have to admit this song is awful.  We have something nice for the end - Jugband Blues, the last song Syd Barrett recorded for the band, is a funny piece, at first sounds a bit folky, but then goes crazy. This song is not to be taken seriously, it is just a joke. I guess Syd wrote this one while He was high on LSD.    Overall, this is one of Pink Floyd most underrated, but best albums. If You search for some excellent psychodelia, You can find it here.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Eight years after the disaster that was \\"Batman and Robin,\\" the Caped Crusader returned to the silver screen in Christopher Nolan's epic \\"Batman Begins.\\" And the wait was definitely worth it. Nolan's film is, simply put, the best in the series. Christian Bale captures the true essence of the character, playing him neither too weak (like Tobey Maguire in the \\"Spider-Man\\" films) or too strong, but somewhere in between, and perfectly. The great supporting cast, fantastic action sequences and dark tone converge to create the best superhero film since the original \\"Superman.\\" The 2-Disc Deluxe Edition comes with amazing extras and a fascinating 72-page comic book with three stories that inspired the movie. Fans of the comic books or previous films will not be disappointed in \\"Batman Begins.\\"<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: A+
B00005KB9W|5.0|Marley's studio work has always bugged me a tiny bit. I mean, the two albums of his I've heard (Natty Dread and Rastaman Vibration) are both solid works, but I don't really like how he insists on dragging so many early tracks back into the fray. I also find myself scratching my head whenever he involves Rastafari, seeing that I am not a Rasta.<br /><br />But this live album, it's a whole different story. The setlist isn't really all that creative (Other than Kinky Reggae and Burnin' `n' Lootin', anyway), but that's what's good about it-just a bunch of Bob Marley classics, no more, no less. Trenchtown Rock is one of his early songs. As I mentioned before, I usually don't care for most of them, but this is really an exception! Then there's Lively Up Yourself, which puts a whole lotta enegy into the album. An instantly catchy riff and lyrics about either a) sex, b) partying or c) riots (depend on who you talk to), this is definetly a classic!<br /><br />The second side does a heckuva job in lining up Bob's three best-known songs (in my opinion, anyway). First, we have this album's resident classic, in the form of No Woman No Cry. If the only version of NWNC we had was the Natty Dread take, I'm sure the song would've been forgotten. But this, to use an enormous clich&eacute;, immortalizes it.<br /><br />Another good tune is I Shot the Sheriff, one of the best-known reggae tunes ever composed. Doing away with the funkiness of the original, we instead get a swaggering organ riff and great backup singers. And, of course, there's Get Up Stand Up. This one's sang almost like a rap, only about fifteen years before rap sadly became mainstream. In the meantime, this is a good song.<br /><br />Lastly, we have bonus track Kinky Reggae. A light-hearted romp about sex and ganja, it eventually evolves into a loose jam and an introduction of the band. The song is great, and will stay in your head forever, even if it's been weeks since you've heard it last.
B000AGTPUA|5.0|From my son, Sam (the biggest Polar Express fan), who has waited patiently for months and wanted to share his review... <br /> <br />After all the waiting and anticipation, I finally got the Polar Express DVD!  It's a holiday movie full of believing in Santa and the spirit of Christmas itself.  I can watch it as many times as I would like on my DVD player. I know everyone will enjoy it so much!
B00005V9IL|4.0|This used to be one of my favorite movies. I bought it again just this weekend and re-watched it. The beginning is a little slow--weak dialogue, too many characters, and technical elements get in the way. However, what makes this film so special is the performance by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. She and Ed Harris do a superb job of holding the movie together. They play a couple on the verge of divorce brought back together when the underwater rig that they developed together is taken over by the Navy Seals.  <br /> <br />The crew of the rig and the rig's original engineer (Mastrantonio) are diverted from an underwater drilling experiment to resue a downed navy sub and its nuclear warheads. As they investigate the accident, Mastrantonio discovers that there are aliens in the ocean depths, not Russian subs. <br /> <br />To complicate matters, the head Navy Seal on board is suffering from an underwater pressure sickness. He steadily looses his sanity and threatens the safety of everyone on board. <br /> <br />The special effects are fun because this was made before CGI got out of control. Yet what holds the movie together is the relationship between the divorcing Brigmans. Amidst the confusion of the underwater equipment and nautical terminology, the special effects, the craziness of the Navy Seal Coffey, is an engaging love story.  <br /> <br />This is what held the movie together for me through the 10 or more years since I've seen The Abyss. I vividly remembered the anmity between the couple at the start of the movie and the heartbreaking scene where they are afraid of loosing eachother forever. And though I was a bit thrown off this time by the technical elements and the simplicity of the dialogue, the connection between Mastrantonio and Harris is as good now as it was then.
B000B8QEYC|4.0|By \\"more of the same\\" I mean no insult - if you're buying an Enya CD, chances are you know what to expect, and you'd be unhappy to discover she'd gone off in some radically different direction. No worries about that here. I happen to like Enya, and Amarantine fits quite comfortably with the rest of her catalog. Lush mixes featuring rich synth pads and Lexicon soaked vocal choirs, pizzicato strings, and Enya's soft, soothing voice floating over it all. If you like Enya, you'll like Amarantine, though this isn't among her best releases, in my opinion.  While this is an entirely enjoyable disc, to my ears there are no standout tracks - not a \\"Storms In Africa\\" or \\"China Roses\\" among the bunch.
B00005NI5Y|4.0|Believe it or not, this is Bob's most recent studio album. Considering that it was made in 2001 by a senior citizen with an incredibly-gravelly voice (Don't smoke, kids!) who has definetly fallen from his prime, it's a great album! Best of all, he doesn't sell out like the Rolling Stones are known to do. So he doesn't try to rap (I don't even want to think about him rapping), drag in current rock stars, take a shot at pop-punk or remix his old hits (So that means we won't get a Like a Rolling Stone Remixes EP).<br /><br />Okay, onto the music...Tweedle Dee & Tweedle Dum is a heckuva way to kick off a great album. Simple, explosive blues rock with twisted lyrics about two gangsters. This is classic Dylan, and seems like a Highway 61 Revisited outtake (and I mean that in a good way). If you like his blues, there's more where that came from, with Summer Days and Lonesome Day Blues. Plus, he returns his traditional twisted sense of humor. He cracks jokes such as, \\"I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,\\" \\"I'm stark naked, but I don't care, I'm going off into the woods, I'm huntin' bare\\", \\"Freddy or not, here I come!\\" and \\"Why don't you break my heart once more, just for good luck?\\" Funny stuff, I'm talking laugh-out-loud.<br /><br />If you want a classic \\"Prophet-o'-doom\\" material, go with High Water. He brings up a few old blues singers and adds some creepy bass drums and banjo that fails to annoy me for a change! But if you want hilarity, Po' Boy and Summer Days should fit in quite well. Just watch out for Sugar Baby (it suffers from the same \\"This-drags-on-forever\\" factor as Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands and Chimes of Freedom, and has awful singing, even for Dylan) and Floater (Very, very annoying arrangement)<br /><br />Great stuff, I must say. You'll even get used to Dylan's voice!
B00005JO1P|4.0|Phoenix is great as Cash. He has the look and the voice. The same can be said for Witherspoon. The plot is good and interesting, but it gets a little boring at some moments. The movie has great music and a good feel. Oscar material.
B000BM6AVA|4.0|Before you place a bias on this review I'll give a quick overview of my relation with System of a Down. I have been a fan for about... 5 years or so now. Yes I jumped on the train when just about everyone else did but System of a Down wasn't exactly a band that you saw a lot of street tapes passed around on.  <br /> <br />This album is the follow up to the previous album and to my knowledge was originally going to be released together but was not due to the feeling that the public wouldn't absorb it properly. A feeling I share mutually. <br /> <br />\\"Mez\\" had a completely different feel than this album. It relates more to tracks like \\"Cigaro\\" on the previous try. It is a very hard hitting, old system style sound, highly unpolished with no attempt to write any single hits other than Hypnotize which is fairly catchy. This is album compliments \\"Mez\\" perfectly. \\"Mez\\" had it's groove oriented, catchy but feeling driven hold to it where as \\"Hyp\\"  was completely thrash oriented. I would suggest buying both albums and treating them like the double disc set they were intended to be. Borrow the cd from a friend first, see if you like it. If you like the songs they've made into videos, you very well may not like the album. On a personal note I love the album and I make sure when I have one cd, I carry the other.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|This is in every way better than slightly disappointing mezmerize and 2nd best soad album behind Toxicity. (why do people like the first album so much i dont know) it's more powerful, moving, slow, fast all at once and is the album of the year <br />2005: <br />#1: Hypnotize <br />#2: Coldplay: X&Y <br />#3: Death Cab For Cutie: Plans <br />#4: Mezmerize <br />#5: White Stripes: Get Behind Me Satan <br />
B00009P1O0|5.0|Well I cant begin to explain to you how good this album is. When I first heard 'Old Man' I bought Harvest and thought it was a good album. I never thought Neil Young was a amazing musician and didnt understand why people were so in love with him, then I bought On The Beach and understood why. This album showed me what others had known for so long and had tried to tell me but I didnt hear. When I went to the store to buy this album is was worried because I knew none of the songs and I debated with myself for five minutes on weather to buy it or not (dont debate just buy), and I decided I will buy it and another album with songs I know, so i bought it and Tonights The Night (which is my favorite Neil album!). When I got home I put on, On The Beach and ever since then I have never stopped listening and appreciating it.<br /><br />At first listen this album turned me from casual fan to fanatic in the first thirty seconds of 'Walk On.' The jangling slide guitars that open the album showed me that not only is Crazy Horse amazing but Neil is one of the best guitar players ever, and being a guitar player myself that turned me onto him even more. The album starts at full speed and the first three songs 'Walk On' 'See The Sky About To Rain' and 'Revolution Blues' are just all out rockers and are what I really love about Neil Young, and thats the passion. The next song 'From The Turstiles' is a banjo pickin' song and was clearly brought on by Youngs bluegrass influences. 'Vampire Blues' aside from being one of Neil Youngs all time best songs is a nice rocker that fits in perfectly on this album, and the lyrics are really cool too. 'On The Beach' and 'Motion Pictures' are nice acoustical ballads with really beautiful and touching lyrics. And Neils voice sounds really amazing on 'Motion Pictures.' On The Beach comes to a close with the nice acoustic 'Ambulance Blues' which is one of the very best songs that Neil Young ever wrote and recorded in his long and tamulchues carear. And of all the songs to end this album this was teh best choice because it eases you out perfectly and leaves you wanting more.<br /><br />On The Beach is a rare album, one that only comes along once and maybe twice if you are lucky in a musicains carear. Dont get me wrong, Harvest was a great album, but it seems to me that is wasnt his best. Tonights The Night blows is out of the water and this one, On The Beach makes Harvest look like the work of a lesser artist, so for those out there reading this review, I highly recomend On The Beach to you.And of all the songs to end this album this was teh best choice because it eases you out perfectly and leaves you wanting more. <br /> <br />On The Beach is a rare album, one that only comes along once and maybe twice if you are lucky in a musicains carear.

B0000248L1|5.0|Annihilator has released some of the fastest and most powerful metal albums since their incarnation, but they will never again release anything as powerful as this 1989 epic. From the multi acoutic flamenco intro Crystal Ann, to the final pounding notes of Human Insecticide, Alice in Hell screams glorious metal. Randy Rampage's vocals are dark and killer. The solos are fast and well thought out. The riffs are dark and heavy and perfectly complemented with bass and drums. Alison Hell, WTYD, Wicked Mystic, Word Salad, and the instrumental Schizos(Are Never Alone) go down in Annihilator history as classic metal movements in a wicked symphony. Annihilator's debut was better than most metal bands in existence and is worth purchasing beyond any doubt.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|I'm a big fan of Adams, and I think he's a very talented artist.  Most people consider this his best.  I don't think so, but I do think its good. <br /> <br />When I first listened to this album, I was quite taken with the first three songs, especially \\"Answering Bell.\\"  I thought he was on a roll.  If were to compare this to throwing an object off a cliff, this would be where the object soars. <br /> <br />That being said, the album continues on with \\"La Cienega Just Smiled,\\" \\"Rescue Blues,\\" \\"Somehow Someday,\\" and \\"When the Stars go blue.\\"  While not quite as capturing as the first three songs, I love them and listen to them about as much.   <br /> <br />After this point, it become clear that my metaphorical object isn't exactly going to fly.  \\"Nobody Girl,\\" SYLVIA PLATH, \\"Enemy Fire,\\" and \\"Gonna Make You Love Me\\" range from the good to the mediocre.  \\"Enemy Fire\\" recalls Neil Young's more crazy horse-esque moments, making it my favorite of this batch.  SYLVIA PLATH starts out really starts out very strong but seems a bit lackluster towards the end, making it overall a good song.  The other two I'm fairly neutral about. <br /> <br />My flight testing object continues on its downward path, whereby we come to my \\"shady\\" area of the album.  \\"Wild Flowers\\" and \\"Harder Now That It's Over\\" are not exactly memorable (i don't remember them very well right now) but I know they're listenable. <br /> <br />I don't know what Adams was thinking when he layed down the last three tracks.  At this point my object crashes into pieces on the rocks below.  Better luck next time. <br /> <br />Overall this another really good album from Adams, but it has flaws.  This could have easily been a 10-12 track cd, but instead, it has 16, so the cd kinda drones in places.  In other words, the garden is beautiful, it just needs to be weeded.
B00005RZV4|5.0|This album, by far, is the best live recording that I have ever listened to.  The sound quality is excellent, and if you listen to it on a stereo with the volume up high, it's as close to being there as you can get.  I've seen NIN twice in my life time, the first time in 96 on the Downward Spiral tour, and then again after the Fragile was released, and this album really incompases their live performances.  Listen to the raw intensity on classics like Wish or Terrible Lie, and then imagine being tossed around in a pit and getting bruised and banged up.  Listen to the crowd chanting the choruses of Head Like a Hole or Closer, and imagine seeing the sweat dripping off of the band clad in black and tossing water bottles at each other.  See the lights in your mind as the crowd breaks out their lighters to ballads like The Great  <br />Below and Hurt.  I'm telling you, for live perfomances, this album has outdone itself.
B000008CX0|4.0|If you expect every Annihilator album to be like Alice in Hell, you'll be disappointed early. Never Neverland would better with the vocal talents of Randy Rampage instead of Coburn Pharr, but it has its appeal yet. <br /> <br />Firstly, I'm always impressed with the instrumentation on these albums. All of the riffs are brilliant, and the solos masterful. Songs like The Fun Palace, Phantasmagoria, and I Am In Command are among Annihilator's classics even to this day. The Never Neverland title track 'ballad' is wicked as well. All the guitarwork on this CD is incredibly well done. As for lyrics, they tend to be more moralistic, advocating against drunk driving, pollution, gambling, nuclear warfare, and corrupt religious leaders. The only out of place song was the goofy Kraf Dinner, clearly about macaroni and cheese. On a whole, I liked this album, especially compared to some of the albums to come.
B000002MU3|5.0|As stated before, Michael Stipe and the boys chucked the mandolin, organ, and string section and made a driven grunge-alt. album.  The release of this album has spawned different rxns.  Some call it a gutsy move.  Others call it trite.  I, however, call it a breakout. <br /> <br />So this album isn't Out Of Time.  Get over it.  Out of time was really good, yet overproduced and filler ridden.  This, al contrario, represents a different side of REM.  To avoid making the same album yet again, they stepped out of what may or may not have been expectations of their label, they droned all of the above out with guitar on overdrive.  \\"Frequency\\" is one of REM's best songs, \\"Strange Currencies\\" is a happy love song from them for a change, and \\"Bang And Blame\\" is owned by echo-effects.  not to mention, \\"let me in\\" is easily the most creative, the most acid-rock recalling REM song to date.  I don't think they've ever done anything more creative.  So, if you are an REM fan who was disappointed by this album, challenge yourself.  Imagine that REM didn't make this, but it was some other band.  Your prespective may change. <br />
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Forty-five minutes of pure bliss that can be addictive like pain-killers!    <br /> <br />Compared to her previous albums, Enya has managed to reach a new level of ethereal height and melodious delight. The sonic production is breathtakingly clear, and her celestially soft voice also feels more intimate and lilting than ever.   <br /> <br />But, due to the more efficiently crafted, more restrained and subtler and thus less schematic and predictable (less pop-like than \\"A Day without Rains\\") nature of her new cycle of songs (which flow together so seamlessly well that \\"Amarantine\\" can be considered a seasonal suite), her previous darker and more ethnically forlorn musical elements are pretty much gone here, which on the plus side does make \\"Aramantine\\" her most beatific album to date.  <br /> <br />Roma's English lyrics seem to be more bland and trited this time around, yet her invented Lexicon is amazingly well suited to Enya's free-flowing voice.      <br /> <br />In all, I'd personally rate \\"Aramantine\\" above both \\"The Memories of Trees\\" and \\"A Day without Rains\\", but a notch below \\"Watermark\\" and \\"Shepherd Moons\\", which were the miraculous albums that made me fall in love with Enya in the first place, and she doesn't disappoint at all this time.  <br /> <br />
B00003CX95|5.0|I've never been much of a Mel Gibson fan, and yes I know that there are some historical inaccuracies in the film, but I couldn't help enjoying this movie.  To me it makes no difference if the face-painting is a few centuries out of date, or whatever other historical flaws there are.  This is a great story about leadership and people's desire for freedom, and it includes great action, romance, drama, and a fair bit of history too.  The bottom line is that it is highly entertaining to watch, and the thinking and feeling it inspires in so many viewers make it a truly great film.
0446577383|2.0|Maybe he was under contractual deadline from his publisher but I couldn't believe how horribly contrived this book was.  I've read most of his earlier works and loved The Winner, Last Man Standing and even The Christmas Train.    I'm not even going to get into the whole \\"America's middle east policy stinks\\" topic.  A person can have their opinions, I have no problem with that. I may agree with Baldacci on the surface about a couple things.  But he does lay it on kind of thick at times and it does get a little old. That being said, this book has many more problems.....      The plot was just lacking. There are questions that aren't fully answered (or maybe I just missed them since my eyes glazed over in parts).  I think Baldacci needed to explain the North Korean involvement and Hemingway's reasonings a little more fully. I think there were too many secondary issues/stories going on that Baldacci just didn't take care of business.     I think his trying to do to much also hurt characterization.  No member of the club really stood out for me.  Hemingway was the most interesting character for me but he really didn't have a large role.  Baldacci's dialogue of the immigrant lady, Aldelphia(??), was beyond annoying. An immigrant conspiracy theorist?? C'mon, I know lots of immigrants and I'll tell you what, they don't go through all the hastle of getting to the U.S. to camp out across from the white house, they're usually too busy working their tails off to do that.      Also, Oliver Stone spends his post-\\"professional\\" career watching the man who is to blame for his family's demise? Not only would revenge more than likely come into his head, but wouldn't he want to at least find out about his daughter? Was he sure she was dead? Wouldn't he want definate answers?      Then Carter Grey at the end...he's gonna kill the president then decides not to...huh? First of all I'm sure he would have really thought something like that out beforehand but instead changes his mind on a pretty weak argument. Secondly, even if he did change his mind, would he leave witnessess to what he had originally planned?? He could be blackmailed with that....oh wait, that's exactly what happened...weak.    I wish people were more serious with their ratings.  I saw a lot of 5-star reviews and was excited to read this, what a let down...yes it's Baldacci, yes he's written some good stories...unfortunately this isn't one of them. If you haven't read this story yet, I would suggest you read something more worthy of your time
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna's Confessions on a Dance Floor is #1 in record sales since its release in the US.  Both the album and single is #1 in the UK. She is #1 in the dance/exended play genre and in #14 pop single according to Billboard.  Need I say more?
B000002MY3|5.0|When this album was unleashed on the world, nobody - including probably Alanis Morissette herself - could have predicted the meteoric impact it would have on not only the music world, but also popular culture itself.  A new generation of youth was empowered by the words and feelings that Alanis offered, finding her music to be therapeutic, as well as a rallying point.<br /><br />Alanis herself is often (and quite unfairly) labeled as an angry woman, even more than a decade after this masterpiece's release.  While there are aggressive songs on this CD, this record covers a myriad of emotions that each of us has.  Through her music, Alanis challenged us all to rediscover those emotions, and in the process, ourselves.  I don't believe I am overstating Alanis' effort; it's that powerful.  Music is supposed to move people, and Jagged Little Pill struck a chord with an astounding number of people around the world, and rightly so.  Songs like \\"Head Over Feet\\" and the `hidden' gem \\"Your House\\" cover a wide range of feelings, with other songs on the record filling in the blanks, including the anthem \\"You Oughta Know\\".<br /><br />In a music scene that currently caters to ITunes and radio, playing for the big single, Alanis had enough foresight to play not for the single, but for the home run.  Each song on this record is huge, and not one song could be considered filler.  Not because it was full of hits, but because it was full of depth and quality, two elements sorely lacking in the current pop tart and cookie cutter era.  Alanis has created many instances of brilliance since this record, but this is the flashpoint for all of it.  This album is truly more than an album; it is an experience.
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is a fantastic book. I have read it many times, and love it more and more with each reading.<br /><br />Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy's journey to find each other was brilliant. The witty dialogue and the entertaining characters make this book quick and so much fun to read.<br /><br />Jane Austen does a brilliant job of portraying the 19th centuty woman's plight in Pride and Prejudice through Elizabeth and Jane Bennet. It was a time where women were only expected to do one thing in their life: marry and marry well. An outspoken and intelligent woman was looked down upon. A woman was not supposed to think, only to please the men in her life.<br /><br />Jane Austen was many years ahead of her time in portraying the unjust social restraints that women had to endure. Her books were the medium that she chose to express her feelings about the social situation of women. Her writings foreshadowed and inspired succeeding generations of women as they fought to obtain equal rights.
0767836324|5.0|Some people think you have to be \\"3 years old or in a coma\\" to enjoy this film.  Rubbish!  My wife and I are well-educated and well into our \\"senior\\" years, but far from senile.  We think this is one of Spielberg's very best, an unmitigated treat from beginning to end.  The cast is superb from top to bottom, and we also think John Williams's score has some of his very best music.  (For confirmation, listen to the series of excerpts he recorded with the Boston Pops by programing your player to skip the other tracks.  Each piece stands on its own without the film's images to support it.)  Finally, we think those who hate the film have the same problem Peter has when he first sits down to \\"eat\\" with the Lost Boys in  Neverland: a lack of imagination and sense of fun.  They need to loosen up and, as the saying goes, get a life.
B000002IGV|5.0|Dee Snider is one sick bastard. Look at what he did to his teeth?! That guy is nuts. TWISTED SISTER acheived some success in 1984 when they released this album, STAY HUNGRY.<br /><br />This is an old favorite of mine, I used to play this back in the mid nineties to all the kids who thought it was bogus, I used to play it LOUD! I WANNA ROCK! blaring out of my boombox out front of the junior high, pissing off everyone! Kids and students alike. That was until it attracted some cool kids who knew how to really rock! BURN IN HELL is one of my all time favorite songs-ever.... it's just that good. A nice solid eighties metal riff, and a smokin' breakdown at the end, so good!<br /><br />Most of this album is more commercial than the first two releases, WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT can be found on every eighties compilation ever made, but there is enough heavy duty eighties garbage on here to make it worth a purchase.<br /><br />If you start here, and want more... I would suggest going backwards, rather than fowards. UNDER THE BLADE is a killer album that came out before this one... whatever came out after STAY HUNGRY is MTV junk that ain't worth much but spit. (Leader of the pack?...Dee, I don't know sometimes...)
B000001E3L|5.0|This is my absolute, number ONE, FAVORITE recordings EVER.  Van Morrison alone is the truest of any musician, and ALL of the guest artists playing together on this Night in San Francisco cannot be topped.  They play together unlike ANY musicians playing together, could have - EVER.  I speak in past tense, as several of the greats on this cut have gone on to Master musician heaven, including a most dear to my soul & thankfully a friend...with an unspoken spiritual vibe/connection - John Lee Hooker, as well as Chicago's Junior Wells & EARLY beginnings bluesman \\"school boy\\" Jimmy    Witherspoon. Plus Georgie Fame, Joe Savana's soprano's - Van's daughter Shauna's vocals, not to mention the most excellent of spirit, vibe, , TOO Tight - not a beat skipped musician connection I think I've ever - to date - had the privilege to enjoy, and this mix,a perfect live performance - start to finish - ended up carrying me - LITERALLY -through the most grieving experience I've ever endured - taking 11 months to go through.  I somehow \\"found\\"  lifeline in it -everyday (in every way....) I played it everyday finding it keeping me, unknowingly at the time, able to somehow, through this recording, able to relate to life after grief - an experience I'd never known - when brain cancer suddenly showed up to take my so very, very precious - mother of mine to her everlasting life with Our Lord. An otherwise very much in good health 67 years young soul of pure love. My grief finally lifted - from June 6th,02 - May 3rd,03 - when 9 days later, May 12, 03, I left Chicago - back to Cali.(trying Oakland this time) Moms gone - too old for the toooo cold - Chi-town winters! me.

Surprise it worked! then it froze my mouse. So i was unable to pick my song or go through the menu. I closed it. And had to reboot. I cant listen to this cd in anything!!!!!!!!!!! but my dvd player on my tv!!!! I bought this so i could listen to it in my system in the Jeep. But it doesn't work for anything. DO NOT BUY IT

B000AM4PBS|5.0|People had to know that all 10 seasons would be released as a box set. Granted, not knowing WHEN was a bit frustrating, but WB was releasing the seasons at a fast rate, I don't understand why people are complaining about \\"fairness\\".  I plan on waiting for the full box set releases of \\"Seinfeld\\" & \\"Roseanne\\" as well.  That being said, this box set is terrific! The bloopers on the season 10 disc are funny!  The producer's commentary on some of the episodes are enlightning, and the actual box that holds the dvd's is wood with a swing open plexiglass door, with a greatly laminated photo of the 6 stars.

B000BM6AVA|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because every time I hear it I like it a little bit more...the songs get catchier and I hear more interesting parts from a musical perspective...but there is a problem with it.  Not enough Serj!  That guy is the whole reason why I love SOAD.  Everything I find intriguing about the band comes from him --- interesting lyrics, melodic chanting and raw, eccentric and unabated power that I just dont see from Daron (despite the fact that he is an amazing musician and songwriter.)  There is not enough Serj in the whole Mezmerize/Hypnotize package.  I think my highlights for this album are his unique vocals on U-fig and the craziness that is \\"Vicinity of Obscenity,\\" because those songs seem to have the most of him in it.  I dont know...he needs to involve himself more, if they want to recapture the excitement that still rings from their self-titled album. <br /> <br />Regardless, Hypnotize is great.  Not as good as it could be, but really good nonetheless.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|John Mayer establishes his inner Stevie Ray mojo with this live trio recording.  It proves that he is not going to be cemented into just a \\"pop\\" niche, and that he's going to take a stab at whatever he wants to do.... <br /> <br />So if all you want to do is run down the halls of your high school, screaming at the tops of your lungs...then maybe this cd won't be for you.  But, if you want to hear an artist reach and grow...and lets be honest, even within some of these blues explorations, Mayer doesn't wholly abandon his pop sensibilities, its just more soulful and textured. <br /> <br />Palladino and Jordan, especially, are tight and great thruout, like they always are...so it gives Mayer enough room to throw out colorful leads and rhythms. <br /> <br />Its new stuff...he's bringing it to the masses....its where he's at right now....come along and enjoy, for now, the reinvention of John Mayer.
B000000OAL|5.0|This album is a must buy for serious rock and roll fans. I think many people would be amazed at the  bombastic music on this metal classic. Stand out tunes are the opening song \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\" and \\"Liar\\" and \\"Modern Times Rock And Roll\\". Another outstanding cut is the incredible \\"Doing All Right\\", a ballad that elevates into some of the most explosive guitar you will ever hear.\\"My Fairy King\\" is an amazing song with my favorite piano on any song ever.  All of the songs on here are great, and it is amazing how talented they were from the beginning. These guys were the best rock group of all time, and this is the best debut album in history. Any metal fan that doesn't have this disc should buy it now. It will blow you away every time.

B00005JOHI|4.0|I've lost count of how many films have been made of Jane Austen's best-loved book, but this latest release is far from the worst. That dubious honor in my view goes to the 1942 movie that had the characters parading around in what looked like wardrobe rejects from \\"Gone With the Wind\\" and Greer Garson at age 36 trying to convincingly play a 20 year old ingenue. Give me a break.<br /><br />The latest film, directed by Joe Wright, is a fairly faithful retelling of Austen's plot, which almost everybody and his mother is familiar with by now, with gorgeous visuals to hook us squarely into the time and place. The visuals, in fact, are so beautiful to look at that at times they tend to overwhelm the story.<br /><br />For anyone out there -- if there is anyone out there -- who doesn't know the plot, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" introduces us to the Bennet family who belong to the upper-middle-class landed gentry in late 18th century England. The second daughter, Elizabeth, sharp as a marble and pretty to boot, meets Mr. Darcy, a tall, dark, handsome and single young man with money out the wazoo. It's loathing at first sight. He despises her middle-class connections; she thinks he's a stuck-up snob with an attitude. The rest of the story has them finding out how wrong they are about each other; there are a lot of interesting plot twists and turns, but in the end, of course, almost everybody ends up living happily ever after.<br /><br />Jane Austen told her sister Cassandra that she thought the book was \\"rather too light and bright and sparkling\\" but that is exactly what has endeared it to generations of readers in print and on film. Who doesn't love a good love story? But there is a problem with this version; perhaps, in trying to tell the whole story in two hours, it's told too much and not enough both at once. The second and third versions of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", on BBC in 1980 and A&E in 1995, were serialized over four to five hours and told the story pretty much as Austen wrote it, especially the BBC version, my personal favorite. Joe Wright's film tries to tell the whole story also but there's too much story for two hours to do it justice. As a result, the film feels compressed in spots. It feels truncated. We don't see nearly enough of Elizabeth's Aunt and Uncle Gardiner, two characters who are central to the book; Bingley's married sister and her husband are left out altogether, and the whole movie has a kind of rushed quality. You won't notice it if you haven't read the book and/or seen the BBC or A&E movies, but you'll notice it a lot if you have.<br /><br />Joe Wright also took some positively unsettling liberties with the Bennets. In Austen's book they are an upper-middle-class family who are the \\"principal inhabitants\\" of the neighborhood. In Wright's film, they look like they've gone to seed. The cows are mooing in the back yard, the pigs are ambling into the premises through the back door, a harried-looking Mrs. Bennet and her daughters are toiling in the kitchen (although in the book Mrs. Bennet indignantly tells the Reverend Mr. Collins that her daughters have nothing to do in the kitchen as the family is perfectly well able to afford a good cook), and a bleary-eyed Mr. Bennet sits in his library looking unwashed, uncombed and unkempt. The whole establishment looks drab and dingy, in need of a good paint job. In the earlier movies Longbourn looks like a fairly prosperous estate; this movie conjures up images of Tobacco Road.<br /><br />Keira Knightley is a delight to watch as Elizabeth Bennet; she's smart, sassy and easy on the eyes. She's as good as Elizabeth Garvie was in the role in the BBC version and she's an improvement over Jennifer Ehle. Belinda Blethlyn is funny and ditzy as Mrs. Bennet, an insufferable airhead whose one goal in life is to marry off her brood. Dame Judi Dench is suitably Gorgon-like as Lady Catherine DeBourgh; it's a shame we don't see enough of her in the film either.<br /><br />The big problem for this reviewer was Matthew McFayden's interpretation of Darcy. For a lot of people who saw the other films, the gold standard for Darcy was Colin Firth, although not for this reviewer; I thought Firth was miscast as Darcy (ducking brickbats from Firth groupies as I type this). Firth was trying to be a very 90's Darcy, sensitive and vulnerable; but his Darcy wasn't Austen's Darcy by a long shot. McFayden plays Darcy as if he were racked with inner torment over his wealth and status; he comes off almost as insecure. If there is one thing Austen's Darcy isn't, it's insecure; he's almost too full of himself to be real until Elizabeth knocks him down a few pegs. McFayden was trying to bring out Darcy's soft side -- he has one, underneath all that starched armor -- but in doing so he underplays Darcy's haughty exterior to the point that we wonder what Elizabeth found so revolting about him in the first place. Something doesn't add up.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, the movie delivers in the time it has to do it in. There is no way to faithfully put \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" on film in only two hours. But the essence of the story is there. It's lovely to watch and nice to listen to. Wright does a creditable job of bring Austen's best-loved book to the screen.

0345457684|5.0|A brilliant first novel; I can't say enough good things about it.<br /><br />If Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler wrote hard science fiction, this is what it might look like.<br /><br />The central conceit of the book--that technology has rendered human beings effectively immortal by enabling constant backups of the brain's contents, allowing a person to be transferred essentially intact into another body--opens up a realm of possibilities that Morgan exploits to the fullest.  It's a murder mystery, or a mystery about a crime that isn't quite a murder, actually...<br /><br />Just buy it, read it, savor it.
0143034901|5.0|This novel will find itself in a top spot of literary works as time passes.  Zafron writes beautifully and masterfully intertwines mystery, intrigue, history, romance and a sharp wit to form a truly enjoyable and memorable story.  It is not necessarily easy to read, most masterpieces are not, and is infused with so much detail it must be read carefully.  Yet curiously, I finished the novel too quickly for I wanted it to continue.  I have been trying to find a novel of this caliber ever since without luck.  Anxiously I await Zafon's next work.

B000B2YQX4|5.0|The immediate chord of epiphany that strikes DM's latest offering is well-suited as the concept of their current discordant vision.  It can rather obviously be stated that this collection of songs is as always brilliantly incisive in a manner that causes the listener to think and feel within the textures of their sound.  Without pause, DM knows their sound, feeling, tone, and most certainly have it down, but it is not simply that as their music always manages to rub existentially.  It is always a persistent Black Celebration, which is not simply to evoke a previous era but to suggest a tenor that embraces beauty and joy, and ugliness and pain in life. <br /> <br />It is always fascinating to read that there seems a majority of DM fans out there that suggest Violator as the work that can never again be approached as their greatest work of all.  Almost without fail, Ultra and secondarily Exciter are snubbed as futile comebacks.  Comebacks from what I may ask? - are you really dying for that 80's tinker of electronica?  It is high time, as Bono has suggested in a live performance from Mexico City some years back, to be open to \\"u know - new sounds.....new colors?\\"  Ultra, apart from the sensibilities of DM retro fans, remains as one of those great unrecognized seminal works.  Well, perhaps that can reflected on here in the Angel, but you know really not, let's just accept new works as fresh that do not have to be warranted to previous works.  Playing the Angel or the Prince of Darkness?  That's a bitter apple my friend. <br /> <br />The Angel - Martin, has seemed to rather run out things to say lyrically, and perhaps the gun motif has run a little long don't you think?  Well, if you don't think and can't recollect the song Barrel of a Gun than focus your mind on reading the lyrics of the last two tracks of this work.  That minor repetition aside, the Counterfeit ep was very enjoyable of an echelon ago, but come on man you really really don't have the voice that your bandmate Dave does - so why insist on singing two tracks?  Instead, focus your insurgency on song-writing and which well twenty-five years in, you appear to have a knack for that sort of thing which has been appraised around the world.  Not one to knock you, since you have kept the bells of DM mightily swinging, but just providing a sound  and more perhaps more importantly a lyrical check. <br /> <br />The Prince of Darkness - Dave, there seem no complaints here, but what of the trade-off that you can write three songs and Martin sing two?  This seems a hard and perhaps dangerous deal.  It was perhaps apparent that this was coming, what with the ascension of Paper Monsters and Martin's CD which seemed, well, for him, to best beset that depression with doing some DJ gigs in California.  Is the battle of the ego entering DM?  Of course, I am not placing blame here since Paper Monsters was unbeatable, it could even be stated that it was Dave candid, or DM in reality stripped to the bone.  Dave, in one of your recent interviews you even stated that twenty-five years in with DM, you still don't know what Martin is thinking.  That seems difficult to swallow.  All this aside, you shine for all those within the darkened halo. <br /> <br />The Prince or the Angel?  Darkness or Light?  Perhaps the difference makes the only possibility to keep on playing...... <br /> <br />\\"Oh Lilian.......look what you've done........\\" <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Well, after the lame American Life, we have been longing for true Madonna material, with attitude, punch, rythm, and melodies that haunt you for hours, days and months.    <br /> <br />Confessions on a Dancefloor delivers all that and more.  <br /> <br />The lead single Hung Up is probably one of the weaker songs on the album which makes the choice to have it out first absolutely bizarre. Nevertheless, it is a catchy pop tune that you can never get tired of, probably because of the Abba sample that lies hidden in our collective memory and that Madonna decided to bring back to life and into our collective present.  <br /> <br />Although the album is practically all singles-material, I am particularly fond of four tracks. Sorry is in my opinion of one of the masterpieces of Madonna, the recurring \\"I heard it all before\\" is just amazing and madonna's voice sounds as great as ever. My second favourite song is definitely Isaac. This is a must have song. The hebrew chants, the deep lyrics, the lovely rythm make it an all time hit. Forbidden Love (ya, same title as one of her previous songs - only Madge) is a sensual song with etheral ethos. The repeating \\"are we made to be together\\" is an existentialist question about relationships, all cast in an elegant tune, sensual melody, and very soothing vocals. I also love JUMP, if you are in the mood to party, this song will take you there.  <br /> <br />This album is reminiscent of high caliber Madonna work, like Like a Prayer and Ray of Light. I am so happy she made this album, this is one of her best - yet of course.  <br />
B000002H70|5.0|After reading several of these reviews, I am amazed that no-one mentioned the fact that this is probably one of the greatest concept albums ever made.  Robert...we are not worthy, and I mean that!!!  It has to be the greatest 72 minutes I have ever heard, and as twisted as it may sound, it helped me through a very rough period in my life.  I say this because this is not the most upbeat album you will ever hear in your life.  The whole landscape of the album runs the gamet of death, and the decline of love and morality.  Even when they try to be upbeat with \\"Lovesong\\", Robert talks about the fact he loves this person, but knows the relationship will never last in the disposable world we live.  \\"Lullaby\\" is about how our heroes have turned on us, and have turned into something very perverse.  \\"Last Dance\\" covers the decline of our planet, both ecologically and morally, and begs to take us back to more innocent times.  \\"A woman left standing, where once there was only a girl\\" could be a reference to the Statue of Liberty.   <br /> <br />Musically, it has to be the most intense and complex work they ever did.  Guitar Player magazine listed it in their top 50 guitar albums, stating that any up and coming guitarist should take layering lessons from these guys. <br /> <br />I have been listening to The Cure since 1983 and would have never guessed they would create this \\"masterpiece\\" 6 years later, especially in an industry that encourages 1 or 2 album wonders.  The album is as important today as when it was first recorded! <br /> <br />I'd like to end by highly recommending this album to any Cure fan who would like to hear them at the top of their game.  Oh, and by the way...don't go after the hits on this album...just put it on...let it play loud...and enjoy the f@#k out of it!!!            <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JOHI|5.0|First off, the casting: Keira Knightley was a good choice for Elizabeth Bennet. She would not have been my first choice after the lovely job by Jennifer Ehle in A&E/BBC's 1995 version, but Keira played the part very well and I believed in her Elizabeth from start to finish! Matthew MacFadyen as Darcy: all I can say is WOW! MacFadyen is a relative unknown (I know him only as the gambling loser Felix Carbury in Trollope's \\"The Way We Live Now\\"): his portrayal was passionate, gritty, determined, loveable, heartfelt and moving: I was completely convinced and fell in love (as other Colin Firth fans will likely do so shortly). Added to these two top-notch choices is some other great talent: Rosamund Pike (Lady Harriet Cumnor in \\"Wives & Daughters\\") as Jane Bennet, Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet, Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Bennet, Tom Hollander (Osborne Hamley in \\"Wives & Daughters\\") as Mr. Collins, and Judi Dench as Lady Catherine de Bourg: the only somewhat puzzling choices were Rupert Friend as Mr. Wickham and Simon Woods as Mr. Bingley...they seemed to make Mr. Bingley's character incredibly nave and almost silly in this film (which I must admit, did add some nice comic relief), whereas the 1995 P&P chooses to make him only too apt to believe the best in everyone too easily influenced by others. Mr Wickham was only slightly likeable to me, and was not given enough screen time for us to truly believe why Elizabeth defended him so much to Darcy. The cast was rounded out with Jena Malone as Lydia Bennet, Talulah Riley as Mary Bennet, and Carey Mulligan as Kitty Bennet, as well as a few others.     The overall storyline and feel: I thought they did an excellent job condensing the storyline into a theatrical movie-length version. I was mighty impressed with the screenwriter, and was not surprised to find out that Emma Thompson (who wrote the screenplay for 1995's \\"Sense & Sensibility\\", as well as giving an Oscar-winning performance as Elinor Dashwood) did an un-credited and unpaid rewrite of the new \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" script: she is given a special thanks in the end credits. The cinematography of the film was well done, with gorgeous scenes and imagery created: the soundtrack score is excellent, soft and unassuming, but seems to blend perfectly with the film: highly recommended. There is little that I would like to change overall: a few content issues (as described below), and otherwise, my changes would be: 1) the final scene: it is a bit too modern-feeling, and not true to Jane Austen as it should be 2) one scene where Lizzie reads a letter: she is upset & crying, only I thought it felt a bit stilted and not quite credible 3) Lady Catherine's speech to Elizabeth: I felt it could have been stronger, and have more \\"umph\\" behind it. Set design and costumes: the costumes work perfectly with the mood and feel of the film: at first I was a bit disappointed that they put Elizabeth in so much brown, but it works very well with the grit and feel of the film (and makes it seem much more real), and there are times (like at the Netherfield Ball), when you get some gorgeous white & light-colored costumes on the characters (including a beautiful snow-white dress on Elizabeth, with a lovely upswept hairdo). I thought the set design was very well done, and loved the very realistic feel of the film: the comparison between the Bennet house and Pemberly is quite drastic and added to the credibility of Darcy's wealth.     For those of you interested in \\"family-friendly\\" remarks, read this paragraph, otherwise you can skip to the next one. Content: There is one scene with a character walking through a room full of white, marble statues, mostly nude, and admiring them: mostly the shots show behinds, though some naked breasts are shown as well in a ceiling painting. There is one use of a*s, and little else in the way of language. There is some dialogue that alludes to the fact that an unmarried man & woman ran off together, not necessarily with any plans to get married, but it is eventually resolved; there is some cleavage shown, but nothing too drastic. All in all, the content is kept to a minimum.     This beautifully-filmed and well-acted movie is well worth the time & effort of going to the movie theatre, in a day and age when there is often little that does such. The romance they created in a few scenes was, I felt, beyond compare. For those of you who loved & enjoyed A&E and BBC's 1995 version of \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, you are in for a treat: there are enough differences in the movies to make them both loveable, but enough similarities in dialogue that you don't feel you are missing anything. This new film & soundtrack is highly recommended (I bought the soundtrack from Amazon UK a month ago, as it is being released Nov 15th in the USA): this movie will also end up being a must-add to any woman's DVD collection!!

B000001E18|1.0|For many years now, I've been a diehard U2 fan. I discovered u2 during senior year at UCLA. This was back during the War Tour period. I managed to get tickets to one of their gigs in Philadelpia...I came home that night with the tune Sunday Bloody Sunday echoing in my head. I had experienced a new and provocative sound in rock...Ever since then, I have made it my personal mission to buy every album subsequently released by u2. I picked up Boy. WOW. I picked up The Unforgetable Fire. WOW. I picked up Joshua Tree. WOW. I picked up Rattle and Hum. WOW. The same goes for Wide Awake in America, Achtung Baby, All That You Can't Leave Behind and their newest CD, How to Dismantle Atomic Bomb. <br /> <br />I remember the day that I picked up Zooropa. <br />The phrase 'vomiting' comes to mind. <br /> <br />Why Bono, why? why couldn't you remain true to the music and the style that you portrayed in the 80s. The fanbase was there during Zooropa. If you had put together something of a masterpiece or even something lacking that luster, we would have paid the $200+ for tickets to your shows, proving our undying devotion. We would have gone days and night, shouting \\"Desire\\" or \\"Walk Away\\". <br /> <br />Instead we listened as the greatest band on earth bludgeoned away all implications of greatness with what can be described as little more than aggravating electronic beeps and whooshes pieced together to drive the dedicated fans to criminal insanity. What is this?  <br />Sorry, Bono. Close...but no guitar. <br />Just because you are the greatest frontman of the greatest band in the world, it does not give you the right to degrade rock n roll to the mediums of electronic warble and drug-enhanced music. Perhaps if I had been on Mary Jane, I would have found this interesting. <br />What happened to the musical talent? Why did you think that the loyal fans did not want another masterpiece like Joshua Tree or War? I don't care if Madonna's doing it...I don't care if Radiohead's doing it... <br />U2 has no excuse for emulating CRAP! <br />It's a wonder that we came back in record numbers for ATYCLB... <br />Never again... <br />In the name of love... <br /> <br />If you are thinking of buying Zooropa, go ahead.  <br />Listen to it.  <br />Be appalled. <br />Join the millions of loyal fans who say, WHY?

B0002234LS|5.0|Secret Window is a gut-wrenching horror tale that is meant to be watched just as it is seen through the eyes of Mort Rainey--thoroughly alone and thoroughly frightened. Which is where the frightening aspect comes from, and is exactly how I watched it.  <br /> <br />From the opening sequence of Secret Window I was enthralled. The slightly off-kelter look the Depp always possesses drew me in, with the even more slightly insane look in his eyes, staring at me through the window of the car. After a few moments I hear a voice: <br /> <br />\\"Do not go back.\\" <br /> <br />This is the moment where all movie watchers should stop and think about whether they want to go ahead, and let themselves have the crap scared out of them. Turn it off, and wonder exactly why he was not supposed to go back, or continue, and go through the Secret Window that is Mort's mind. <br /> <br />After this point move six months forward, and now Mort is the burnt out novelist; he's facing a case of writer's block the size of Mt. Everest, an ugly divorce, and the loss of his baby. He lives in a cabin in the middle of nowhere'sville New York, and has this crazy southerner hounding him about a story that he claims Mort stole from him--what's not to like about this setting? <br /> <br />Soon enough tension levels start to rise, and you begin to get little ideas in your head. Is Ted trying to push him into signing the divorce papers? Is Shooter just crazy? Did Mort really steal the story? <br /> <br />The movie is moving along with the force of a subway train when we finally get to the trainwreck--a riveting scene in which Mort has to face Shooter, and all of his demons come out. The climactic scene is truly that--climactic and chaotic, as we are forced to choose between his almost-innocent wife and Mort, who we have been pulling for all along.  <br /> <br />Hitting Ted in the face with the shovel was hillarious, the end scene with the corn haunting as Mort chants: <br /> <br />\\"All that matters is the ending,\\" he says, pausing for effect, \\"and this one... this one is perfect.\\" And let me tell you folks, once you go through the Secret Window... there is no coming out.
0142000655|5.0|After the slaying of his brother, the biblical Cain dwelt in the land \\"east of Eden,\\" protected from the wrath of men by the divine mark placed upon him but vulnerable to his own sense of guilt and its consequence, a forlorn and hateful existence.  Does Cain still have the choice of salvation through self-determination or is he foredoomed to damnation?<br /><br />The answer to this question is crucial to the characters in Steinbeck's novel, where parallels to Cain and his brother, Abel, are abundant.  Predestination or self-determination?  Both philosophies come to bear on the characters in this story.  We see the unrelenting descent into sin and depravity by the child Catherine as her cold and calculating acts become ever more heinous and she devolves from the girl Cathy into the woman Kate, the madam of a house of sadism.  At the end, Kate frightens herself into suicide, which, by the way, is one of Steinbeck's powerful ironies inasmuch as the person whom Kate fears is, unbeknownst to her, already dead.<br /><br />Of all the persons whom we meet in this novel, Kate alone seems to have no hope of salvation, and this hardly seems fair for she alone seems to have had no choice. She alone appears predestined to damnation.  She alone feels no remorse, no guilt, indeed nothing at all. She alone is utterly cold and empty of human emotion.  She is preternaturally evil, and she seems to have been born thus.  Is she, then, the counterpart of the biblical Eve, whose act of disobedience was so unforgivably heinous that not only she but all of her progeny were driven from the Garden of Eden into a dark, painful world and made to suffer for her Original Sin for as long as mankind shall exist?  (We must accept Christian mythology here for sake of discussion.)<br /><br />As the biblical Eve was the consort of the biblical Adam, and the dam of Cain and Abel, so Kate begets Caleb and Aron, who are raised as the sons of her husband, Adam Trask. The fact that Adam's brother Charles was the biological father adds even more to the ponderous weight of sin that courses through the novel.  Can the generations ever be freed of spiritual darkness?  The answer lies in Timshel, the Hebrew verb meaning, according to the Oriental servant and philosopher Lee, \\"thou mayest,\\" a translation different from that commonly accepted in the King James Version of the Bible.<br /><br />Lee suggests that God continues to give man a choice, free will to work toward repentance and salvation or toward sin and damnation.  \\"Thou mayest\\" follow the course that thou will.  Caleb, even though he feels that he is mean and ugly and that his actions led to Aron's death, hence making him a murderer as surely as Cain was a murderer, may nevertheless prove to be the turning point and achieve salvation.  If he manages this, it will be through the influence and aid of Abra, and her presence in the story saves Steinbeck from being labeled a misogynist, to which his portrayal of Kate would surely have led.  Still, the turning point lies in the future beyond the end of the novel, and Steinbeck does not tell us whether or not Cal succeeds.  Abra's name inevitably reminds me of that of Abraham, too; are she and Cal destined to be the founders of future \\"saved\\" generations?<br /><br />These are only a few of the major themes that weave through this work. We could also explore the fatal flaw shared by Adam and his son Aron, their failure to see reality and their insistence of living in a world that is as insubstantial as their naïve dreams.  Thus do they contribute to their own destruction.  We could examine more of the ironies of life that permeate this novel, as they do all of Steinbeck's creations. Suffice it to say that EAST OF EDEN is full of both interest and meaning, for it speaks to the essential question of mankind's spiritual salvation, a question that has resulted in tremendous schisms among theologians, and it speaks to this question through a constantly evolving plot that captures the reader's interest immediately and pulls him through the novel without pity!<br /><br />This book probably belongs on the \\"must-read\\" list of American novels, and I commend it and its message to every literate adult (and precocious teenager) who possesses the will and the courage to examine the most basic of human choices and who is willing to decide for himself how to translate \\"Timshel.\\" However, there is a prerequisite reading assignment. Before starting EAST OF EDEN, do read at least Chapters 3 and 4 from the Book of Genesis. They're short, but without some knowledge of them, the reader will miss the point that Steinbeck so intriguingly makes.t that captures the reader's interest immediately and pulls him through the novel without pity! <br /> <br />This book probably belongs on the \\"must-read\\" list of American novels, and I commend it and its message to every literate adult (and precocious teenager) who possesses the will and the courage to examine the most basic of human choices and who is willing to decide for himself how to translate \\"Timshel.\\" However, there is a prerequisite reading assignment.

B000BM6AVA|4.0|Rather than review each portion of this album separately (Mesmerize/Hypnotize), I've decided to review the collection as one whole. First, I find it amusing that when \\"Mesmerize\\" came out 6 months ago, everyone thought that it was great. Fast forward to now and the response seems partially luke warm with some being outright negative towards \\"Hypnotize\\". I think had this second part to the overall album just been released as a double album, everyone would have loved it. Perhaps the band made a miscue by dividing the releases apart from one another? Or perhaps System Of A Down has hit the beginning of their popularity downslide. This seems to be the case with any artist: once they hit their popularity peak, there's nowhere to go but down. Granted, U2 has seemingly defied those odds by consistently releasing bad albums that the public herald as \\"classic\\" but for the rest of the bands on Earth, it's all a game of how long they can stay atop the wave before they get sucked into the current.<br /><br />I'll put it this way: \\"Toxicity\\" was truly a landmark album for this band. It not only made System Of A Down a household name but beyond the hype, it is an album of truly great songs. They established themselves an identity and broke far and away from the term nu-metal all in one fell swoop. Naturally, this album will likely always be their benchmark with most people and though it's not their most creative album by any stretch, the strength of the songs solidified it as a truly classic album. With \\"Mesmerize/Hypnotize\\", you might be able to scrape together a similar amount of strong songs between the two as you got with \\"Toxicity\\" by itself. From my perspective, System Of A Down has grown creatively and musically since \\"Toxicity\\" and the level of experimentation is obvious but in the end, they may have sacrificed the opportunity to \\"strike while the iron is hot\\" in terms of having songs the world will love.<br /><br />To that, I say who cares what the world wants. The world's (namely America) music audience has a very short attention span and it always will. Though I think System Of A Down has hit a weird period in their career, I think the combination of creativity and songwriting is going to result in their best works in the future. Unfortunately, with some people seemingly already jumping ship, who knows how many people will still be around to enjoy it.orld's (namely America) music audience has a very short attention span and it always will.

B0002IU988|3.0|Overall, the album lacks diversity both lyrically and musically. I was highly disappointed when I got this album and only one song stood out to me which was In Loving Memory. The overall mood is rather solemn, if a person likes listening to that sort of thing. I do love Tremonti's guitar use in songs like Metallingus, Broken Wings, Find the Real, and The End is Near. That part of the album is swell. Myles Kennedy can sing as well, especially in Burn it Down and One Day Remains, but in songs like Open Your Eyes, the \\"ooohs\\" are a bit overdone. Overall, the songs I can tolerate are Burn it Down, In Loving Memory, Down to My Last, Watch Your Words, and Shed My Skin.

Conside this lyrical gem courtesy of Mr. Scott \\"Troubled Heroin Boy\\" Weiland: \\"Take time, with a wounded hand, cause it likes to heal. Take time, with a wounded hand, because I like to steal, I like to steal. Think you're kind of neat, but she treats me like a creep.  <br />Wow, we're talking about a regualr Lord Byron here. Move over Yeats, SCott Weiland is the king of pain. With chessy guitar riffs from the Mel-Bay beginners guide, this puppy is among the 90's worst crap-bands ever. Punk rock for spoiled rich kids that sleep on Tempur-Pedic mattresses and snort high-end Cloumbian drug dealer blow with their $150 day allowances from DAddy Moneybags while watching Ferris Bueller rereuns. No wonder Columbine occured one year after this piece of crap came out. The youth of America really cooked their brains listening to crap like this.
B0006IEVFG|5.0|I've had one of these for a couple of years (replacing my previous ten-year-old Casio, which was beat up but still working) and been very satisfied. A pity it's a discontinued model and there don't seem to be current models in this price range with these features. <br /> <br />I have the version with a stainless steel strap. Dislike the black resin strap - one thing I and other reviewers agree on. Too bad the metal-strap version seems hard to find now.  <br /> <br />Like the solar-power feature. Replacing the battery on my previous watch (while keeping the water-resistance guarantee) meant sending it away to be done, which took weeks and cost almost as much as just replacing the fairly inexpensive watch.  <br /> <br />Like the databank feature, which stores 30 phone numbers. Thought it was a gimmick, but I find it very useful.  <br /> <br />[...]%2D1AV
B000B8QEYC|5.0|All of her releases have several years between them.  So, disappointment is always possible, but this is typical and enjoyable stuff.  My gripe that has been flirted with in some of the comments is why not put 10 to 20 minutes of alternative takes with more or fewer instruments.   The studio is clearly her strong suit, and how cool it would be to hear the tracks done with less over-dubbing for instance, or even just voice.  Guess it will be 2010 before the next entree, so just enjoy.
B000002KIE|1.0|I've said it before and I'll say it again: punk is the lowest form of music this side of Avril Lavigne and Green Day.  The Sex Pistols were and are a joke.  They were not even a real band.  They were not real musicians.  They were a marketing scam and nothing more.  Their record company put them together, wrote them a whole bunch of lyrics about \\"ANARCHY!\\", and sold the result to a bunch of gullable, immature fools who were too naive to recognise a scam when they saw it.  The Pistols weren't about rebellion.  The Pistols weren't about anarchy.  The Pistols weren't about liberation or freedom.  They were just a gimmick designed to make their record company a fortune, much like a 70s version of Avril Lavigne or Green Day.  They were so obviously a corporate scam that they might as well have dressed in suits and ties on the stage.  Most blatently hypocritical of all is the fact that these whiney noisemaking @ssholes became filthy rich, multi milionaires, even as they moaned and groaned about the filthy living conditions in Britain's working class society.  I guess like all punk rockers, the Sex Pistols are total hypocrites.   <br /> <br />\\"ANARCHY IN THE UK!  ANARCHY IN THE UK!  Now what did I do with my royalties cheque?  I have to go to the bank and add another million pounds to my bank acount.  We can't have anarchy unless I'm a multi millionaire.  ANARCHY!\\" <br /> <br />Don't you punk \\"rockers\\" realise what a scam the Sex Pistols were, and even worse, how gullable and naive you must be to these that these bas.tards were rebellious anarchists?  If you really believe that the Sex Pistols are a great band, I pity you and hope that some day you'll realise the truth.  The Sex Pistols are the shi.ttiest band that ever existed.

B000BHHVPO|5.0|As many were, I too was skeptical of how well this set would turn out and after just having finished watching all 10 hours I am pleasantly and enthusiastically astonished! I still can't believe what a wonderful job they did putting this concert together on DVD.<br /><br />The audio is great in 2.0 stereo and in 5.1 and DTS it will blow you away. Instead of having chapter listings they have each DVD's list of performers for easy searching for your favorite and start at the beginning of that act. But the chapters are setup so you can skip individual songs. The Video is 16:9 and excellent and many things were cleaned up from the original broadcast feeds. As for the performances, if you saw it on TV, you already know how good it was and if you didn't you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />I'm buying one for everyone on my holiday shopping list that I know will enjoy these concerts. As for my comment on the value of this set, where in this day and age can you get great entertainment for only three dollars an hour? Do yourself a favor and get this set and Enjoy!
B00005JOHI|2.0|Although I do not consider myself a \\"finnicky\\" Austen purist, there is only so much irreverence I can take. If you want a good laugh - go see this. Although it's more likely you'll laugh AT it than with it. I realize they were extremely pressed for time, and in light of that I do give them some credit for what they tried to do. However.......    My main quarrel is with Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy, who is wooden and awkward (and I don't compare him with Colin Firth - this is how he truly is without comparison)I read in a review that Mcfadyen did not read the book before they began shooting. What a mistake! Maybe if he had, he should have done more justice to the character and the movie.    Secondly: Keira Knightly, who i'm afraid is just another pretty face. She cannot play Elizabeth, most of the movie she walks around with an artificial smile, and when in doubt, tries to play up Lizzy's vivacity by laughing, when nothing is really amusing. True, she was not so gratingly bad as Mr. Mcfadyen, but I think she too, missed the essence of the character.     As for the rest of the Bennet clan, I think a former reviewer caught it very well: they are barnyard rustics living in a shabby house, where the daughters are seen baking - then later Mrs. bennet denies that her girls have anything to do in the kitchen! as for the other girls: Jane is lovely, but too shy. Lydia looks more like she should be playing Mary, and vice versa. Mr. Bennet is seen in the book as a sort of indolent country gentleman who is fond of books, in this version we see him taking an active role in the farm, and when he is in the house, trying vainly to be witty. Donald Sutherland was a bad choice.    What is most disturbing to me though, is the closing scene, all fans of the book and the A&E version will agree - this is weird, awkward, and completely uncalled for. What would Jane Austen think? I wonder.
B00008S2VG|4.0|Despite all that has been said about this album, then rehashed and regurgitated time and again, it is ludicrous to overlook the achievement of these songs which are so much better than the public perceived it. <br /> <br />Take into account that, despite being one of Madonna's so-called flops, it debuted at #1.  Despite it only spawning one Top 40 hit in the US (the title track), seven...yes...SEVEN of the eleven tracks hit Top 10 on the US Dance chart, and Madonna was still the #1 Dance artist of 2004.  Lastly, check the immense success of the Re-Invention Tour. <br /> <br />If this was one of Madonna's low moments...man, I wish my professional low moments were as successful. <br /> <br />As Madonna releases the much-anticipated (and absolutely brilliant) Confessions on a Dance Floor, it is time to stop calling this work \\"crap.\\"  Aside from the absolutely horrific \\"I'm So Stupid\\" and the less-than-mediocre \\"Hollywood\\" (before Stuart Price, co-producer of Confessions, got his remixing hands on it), this album has some extremely beautiful moments and some of Madonna's strongest recordings, both artistically and vocally. <br /> <br />\\"Nothing Fails\\" is an extraordinary song of yearning.  The melodies of \\"Love Profusion\\" are absorbing.  The vocals of \\"X-Static Process\\" are beautiful.  The electro-power of the album's strongest track, \\"Nobody Knows Me,\\" is one of the highlights of this incredible woman's career...and the album includes the first James Bond theme to crack the Top 10 in eons to boot. <br /> <br />It's time to stop insulting this creation that is \\"American Life.\\"  Could it be considered Madonna's concept album?  Sure, why not.  She took yet another chance, something so many artists never have the courage to do, and came out of it unscathed.  Despite the horrible criticisms and negative comments, this will remain a #1 album that spawned numerous hits on the dance chart, along with international pop charts.  If this is the worst she can do, that just provesjust what an incredible artist she truly is. <br />
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Go to a dance club and let a cover band or DJ put \\"I don't wanna be\\" on and you're gone! It's a great song to dance to, and this cd is a great surprise from a new kid on the block.<br /><br />His guitar playing, songwriting, and singing abilities are sure to land this guy in high places. Come on, this debut ain't a bad start. This is a cd that should be in every American household, especially those who love good American rock.<br /><br />My cd is so scratched it skips, need a new one!
B000BISBDY|5.0|What people say about leaders is also true about Johnny Cash fans: They aren't born, they're made. <br /> <br />As a child of the 80s--a time when \\"Karma Chameleon\\" was considered the height of musical sophistication--I never knew much about Johnny Cash. I just knew him as The Man in Black, a vaguely famous country singer. Then I saw Walk the Line, bought The Legend of Johnny Cash CD, and was converted. Cash has IT. He has that something that makes the listener stop and connect with the song. <br /> <br />So, as a new fan, it's a difficult if not impossible task to pick the \\"best\\" songs on this career-spanning album. All the older hits are there--\\"Cry Cry Cry,\\" \\"I Walk the Line,\\" \\"Get Rhythm,\\" \\"Ring of Fire\\"--and haven't lost their original luster. (\\"I Walk the Line\\" is my personal favorite from this era because the lyrics cut straight into the soul of anyone who's ever been cynical, lonely, and completely surprised by love.) \\"Jackson\\" is a firecracker-hot duet with June Carter, but \\"It Ain't Me, Babe\\" is conspicuously absent. <br /> <br />His more contemporary works--\\"Delia's Gone,\\" for instance--also stand out as testaments to the timelessness of his rolling bass line and world-weary voice. Cash's covers, too, are brilliant. His rendition of Hank Snow's \\"I've Been Everywhere\\" is appealing, as is his take on Soundgarden's \\"Rusty Cage.\\" <br /> <br />But, for me, the number one song on the album is \\"Hurt,\\" Cash's interpretation of Nine Inch Nails' paen to addiction. His quavering vocals bely the universality of the pain of addiction, and the slowly-building background music makes the reader understand the increasing desperation of dependency. The song wraps you up in its raw emotion and nearly overwhelms you. For a second, you know what it means to be an addict, to give anything--\\"my empire of dirt\\"--to change. For a second, Cash sets up shop in your soul. <br /> <br />After hearing \\"Hurt,\\" I knew why so many people love Cash. While his voice may quiver, it has a dramatic urgency that burns the songs into your brain. That voice is the sound of redemption from a man who's been to the bottom and barely made it back up. <br /> <br />Bottom line: This is an excellent introduction to The Man in Black. It's a small slice of his talent, but it's sure to leave you wanting more.

B000B8QEYC|5.0|It has been a long long journey for Enya fans. (among whom I count myself). It was worth the wait. I've only been a real fan of Enya for a couple of years now. The first album I bought was A Day Without Rain, and soon bought all the others, including three singles with non album tracks. Her music is, in my opinion, wonderful stuff. Many people don't like her, and write her off as a hack, a grand hoax passed off as \\"good\\" music. <br />Well, each to his opinion, I say. But, even though a good many people don't like her, a good many more think she's wonderful. <br />This new album is a treat, and carries on in the tradition of  Shepherds Moon, DWOR, etc. I must have played Long Long Journey half a dozen times after the initial hearing. Though I had my doubts about songs being sung in a fake language, I must admit the ones sung in that language were appealing, and suit Enya very well. Enya does good stuff, and if you don't like her, why bother listening to and then reviewing her albums? It makes no sense. Life is much too short. If you like Enya (and millions of us do) then you'll buy the new album despite what \\"critics\\" say. <br />Buy it, enjoy it, and tell the rest of the world where to put thier opinions.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|System of a Down has succeeded on a number of areas. <br />1- They have crafted what is the best album (both discs are accounted for as one in this review) of the year (arguably) hands down. <br />2- This new collection of music has really filter out the fans that just don't understand their music. <br />3- They reinvented themselves. <br /> <br /> The year 2005 was fairly slow for TRUELY classic albums in music. But count on System of a Down to use their unique musical talents to completely come and create something that people will talk about for the longest. \\"Mesmerize/Hypnotize\\" is compiled of studio sessions they had in reccording a new album. They settled on releasing two albums 6 months apart to let people grasp the albums on a creative aspect. <br /> This album brings alot of changes to the album. For one, the musical content (thanks to Rick Rubin; most seen on the \\"Mesmerize\\" side of things) has been highly upgraded. One listen to \\"Soilder Side and Question\\", and you can clearly hear that they have stepped up their game to the max. Another change is the increased time that yesteryear back up singer and guitarist Daron has recieved on lead vocals. It doesn't bother this reviewer as much as it does other fans, but personally, I can't help but wonder the difference that would have been made (for better or worse), had Serj been at the forefront. <br /> I'm going to highlight the vocals for a bit. System of a Down's best songs on the album are simply when Serj and Daron sings in harmony. Daron's traditionally high pitched voice fits PERFECTLY with Serj's unique Armenian stylings. It creates such an atmosphere that truly highlights the chemistry these guys truly have. This is best presented in \\"Holy Mountains\\" (possibly my favorite System of a Down track). <br /> On a lyrical stand point, most people will not get the lyrics at all. But for the true diehard fans that understand System's music, it will all come to you with repeated listens. This is an album that you meditate on and things just come to you. The stupiest sounding songs (lyrically) like \\"She's Like Heroin\\" or \\"Cigaro\\" have WAY deeper meanings than presented at first listen. <br /> This album is a ride that must be heard from start to finish. From \\"Soilder Side (Intro)\\" to \\"Lost in Holywood\\" to \\"Attack\\" and back to \\"Soilder Side\\", In my opinion, there isn't a skipped song on here. I could honestly listen to this album from start to finish - no problem. Classic Work; A Modern Masterpeice. From the infusion of different styles into their already working formula, to their intoxicating voices, to the class A drumwork <br /> <br />
B000BJS4SU|5.0|I'll start by saying this; John Mayer gets music. He can write incredible pop songs as he has shown with his previous albums. He has appeared with legendary artists such as Herbie Hancock and Buddy Guy, just to name a few. Now with The John Mayer Trio he is really hitting his stride.<br /><br />From the opening track \\"Who did you think I was?\\", you know that this album is not going to be the type of album that your little sister will like. Unless, that is, she happens to enjoy masterful blues-infused rock.<br /><br />There are songs on the album the traditional John Mayer fans will enjoy. Gravity is a bluesy rock tune, but is similar enough to his previous efforts to make the pop fans happy. Of course there are a few of his older songs covered here as well; Daughters and Something's Missing, both originally off of \\"Heavier Things\\" are redone here with the Trio. Daughters is an interesting choice as I can think of a few other songs off of \\"Heavier Things\\" that would have been more likely selections. That said, it is still a solid song.<br /><br />I have always enjoyed Mr. Mayer's music. I am a musician and songwriter so I can certainly respect a well crafted pop song, but it wasn't until I saw the DVD \\"Any Given Sunday\\", that I truly realized what he is capable of. To put it simply, the man is a guitar virtuoso that plays with as much feel as Stevie Ray Vaughn and Jimmy Hendrix. I do not say that lightly either, as I am an enormous fan of both.<br /><br />On this album it is abundantly clear that this group of musicians is at the top of their game. Steve Jordan is always spectacular and is rightfully one of the most respected and sought after studio drummers in the country, if not the world. Pino Palladino is equally well-known and has played with some of the top acts in the world.<br /><br />The JM3 live show, which I happened to catch at the Borgota in Atlantic City, NJ, is quite an experience. From the blues fans that came to the show out of curiosity, to the 15 year old girls with a slightly confused \\"I think I like this but it's not what I expected\\" looks on their faces, the crowd was into the performance. This album does a good job of capturing the vibe of the live show.<br /><br />Crank it up and enjoy! An album like this doesn't come out very often., to the 15 year old girls with a slightly confused \\"I think I like this but it's not what I expected\\" looks on their faces, the crowd was into the performance. This album does a good job of capturing the vibe of the live show. <br /> <br />Crank it up and enjoy! An album like this doesn't come out very often.

B000AARKOO|3.0|<br />Making a film about the crusades against the backdrop of the War on Terror was always going to be a delicate business. That said, when scholars are lining up to blast the production as `complete rubbish' and `Osama bin Laden's version of history' the director has clearly missed the mark. Ridley Scott got away with sacrificing history to entertainment in Gladiator because that film didn't ask viewers to believe they were watching the real thing. Kingdom of Heaven does, parading a Hollywood plot construction as fact and inevitably offending a great many people given the sensitivity of the subject matter. Scott's boasts of the film's authenticity have only deepened the hole he has dug for himself by rewriting the past as a progressive political statement. To make things worse, he hasn't made a very good movie.  <br /> <br />Balian the blacksmith (Orlando Bloom) is the illegitimate son of a crusader who has struck it big in the Holy Land and is back in France to tie up loose ends. Having indiscreetly murdered the local priest, Balian is persuaded by his old man to start afresh in the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem. For this is a `Kingdom of Conscience', a utopian project in a world bound by chains of class and religion, where men are judged by character and not their background. Not that this matters for Balian, given that he inherits his father's fief of Ibelin and starts an affair with the king's sister. Nevertheless his `quality' is recognised by everyone from Arab noblemen to the leprosy-afflicted King Baldwin, who on his deathbed offers Balian the throne to keep it from the clutches of Guy de Lusignan and his fanatic Knights Templar. Unfortunately Balian defers to the warmongering Guy, who proceeds to get Jerusalem's army destroyed by the Muslims, leaving Balian in charge of the city's defence against the legendary Saladin.  <br /> <br />One gets the feeling that Scott devised this Middle Eastern Camelot less from conviction than from a desire to avoid his subject matter's political minefields. Ironically the resulting revisionist schemozzle stumbles right into them, hence the barrage of criticism from Cambridge academics to internet bloggers, Muslim and non-Muslim alike. Even uninformed viewers are not likely to buy Scott's pitch of the crusader states as an egalitarian and multicultural paradise, hammered home by shots of Arab children cavorting round Balian as he dirties his hands making the Palestinian desert bloom. Audiences are more likely to see a prescription for the region's current politics rather than an accurate representation of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, which rested on a feudal-religious hierarchy with Latin Christians at the top and Muslims at the bottom. To prop up this historical hatchet job, Scott resorts to demonising a particular group; casting the Templars as vicious fundamentalists is both wrong and as convincing as any cardboard caricature of plot villains. The more Scott bloats up his artificial edifice, the more factual license he has to take: Balian becomes a virtuous plebeian and Sibylla a free-riding amazon, Guy and Reynauld morph into Templars, Baldwin gets an extra year of life so he can be around for the film's events.  <br /> <br /> <br />Such historical gymnastics reveal Scott's misconception of the task facing him. It was impossible for such a movie to be both politically neutral and accurate, since the crusades and the responding jihad were fundamentally religious projects that directed violence against unbelievers. Scott makes some concessions to history, including wild-eyed clerics preaching the sanctity of killing Muslims and Saladin's casual beheading of Christian prisoners, but ultimately he shies away from confronting his subject matter. The result is not just synthetic but cheapens the realities of cultural and sectarian hatred, which in today's political context ought to get more serious treatment. If Scott wanted an alternative focus then he could have explored the manipulation of ideas for political ends, a theme for which the crusades offer plenty of material. This would have allowed for even-handed contemporary resonances, from uncritical Western assertions of ethical purity to exploitation of the crusades as a diversion from the failures of Arab states.  <br /> <br />Politics aside, Scott approaches this film from the wrong technical angle. Put simply he chooses spectacle over verisimilitude, notwithstanding that the latter marks out good period drama. In Kingdom of Heaven, the dunes of the Moroccan desert substitute for coastal Palestine. Jerusalem is unrecognisable, sitting in a featureless plain with a non-existent mountain rising in its centre. Battle scenes fall back on the tired formula of incoherent masses and heedless charges, without even a rudimentary effort to show tactics. The central battle of Hattin is glossed over completely, in favour of vistas of Quranic war banners, an improbably gaudy True Cross and Saladin's army engaged in the first all-Arabian derby. Jerusalem's bombardment resembles the opening night of Operation Iraqi Freedom more than a credible twelfth-century siege.  <br /> <br />It is hard to believe that the man who directed Alien and Bladerunner accepted a script as flat as this one. All the characters are two-dimensional, excepting perhaps Balian's short-lived father (Liam Neeson) and the withered King Baldwin. Balian's character leaps full-fledged into the film, leaving Orlando Bloom with nothing to do but look rugged and show off his sword fighting skills. Even Saladin is reduced to a quasi-orientalist portrayal, passing up the chance to explore the complexities of this brilliant Kurdish warrior statesman. Indifferent characters can be carried by a strong story, but plot defects abound in Kingdom of Heaven. The film's linearity suffers from unexplained scene cutting: one moment Balian is leading a refugee column out of Jerusalem, the next he's back in France working as a blacksmith. Bizarre plot devices further erode the narrative's credibility. Why is a Syrian aristocrat cross-dressing with his servant and pledging himself as Balian's slave? Why does Balian prepare for assassins by sitting alone with no weapon outside his castle walls?  <br /> <br />Because Kingdom of Heaven doesn't quite work as a film, it comes across as a gratuitous political exercise. The very title should put viewers on guard as to the film's authenticity. It is not void of redeeming qualities; Scott's sense for colour and lighting remains exquisite, while the leper-king Baldwin evokes genuine pathos. But it fails dismally at the challenge of making history into entertainment.  <br /> <br />
B000BO0LLS|1.0|Wow, is all I can say to the many people that are giving this cd 5 stars. Don't get me wrong, Mariah back in the day was fire!, she could sing good, and she looked great. But come on now people really, you hopeless Mariah fans who were desperately waiting for her to make a comeback got exactly what you wanted. An overrated sorry excuse for a quality cd. And that's not even mentioning her voice!!! AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO HEARD HER SING ON THE AWARDS SHOW? You cannot tell me this girl can sing anymore! For crying out loud, she had a backup track on the VMA's!  <br /> <br />The high pitched note that she overly uses throughout the album is nothing more than annoying now. Her shifiting in sining between her full and soft voice is overused. The song material has gone downhill for example the whole \\"It's like that\\" song. Really the only thing good on this album she did was hire producer Jermaine Dupri who helped give her some decent beats.  <br /> <br />Its sad to see these great artist of their time try to come back as if they are reinvented but really all they do is sell themesleves out to try to fit into the younger crowd that is dominating the industry. They begin to loose the very thing they had that made them special in the first place, and result in tasteless activity to try to recapture their youth, and the youth of today.  <br /> <br />I will admit that \\"don't forget about us\\" is sort of listenable, but get real, the only reason why it might have some success is because it's riding on the coattail of \\"we belong together\\". Hopefully people are starting to understand that as an artist she is completely overrated, and her music which once was great has hit an all time low. How can this even be considered a comeback album?....comeback to what, it doesn't even compare to some of her earlier stuff, when the music was real and inspirational. Last but not least, please tell me how they have the audacity to re-release an album 4 times! I guess the theory is right, and everyone who bought this album is living proof (if you keep shoving things at people, eventually they will be suckered into buying it). I must say for anyone who purchased this album....Congratulations on wasting your money!
B0002OERI0|1.0|Oh yeah, thats right, your beloved \\"Kings of Punk\\" are nothing more than little whores for the Warner Bros. music group. In case you didnt know Warner Bros. is a massive payola company who gives local radio DJ's and program directors kick backs and free stuff to play their artists songs and to unnaturally inflate playlists to make songs more popular than they are. Guess who one of the top acts they did this all for was?? You guessed right, Green Day. The suposed \\"punks\\" who are against the establishment are in fact, working hand in hand with it, knowing full well that Warner Bros continued the practice of Payola with other artists. You really think they had no idea this was going on? <br /> <br />All this from a supposed \\"punk\\" group who writes an album called \\"American Idiot\\" while they cling to the corporate breast for their paychecks. Why is a so called group who rails against corporate america and its evils, participating fully in one of the most disgusting practices in the music industry today. <br /> <br />Ever think you might not hear \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" unless some local radio program director gets his first class business tickets? This is not true punk and I have not heard Green Day make one statement regarding the whoring of their music and image. Im gonna guess they dont really care as long as they get paid and they can pretend to be \\"punk\\" <br /> <br />I guess the title \\"American Idiot\\" referred to all those who bought this CD and actually believed that Green Day was in the biz for something else than money.
B00005JO1P|2.0|I was expecting some depth to the love story between Johnny Cash and June Cash. But this is the story according to the movie: Johnny (previously J.R.) comes from a poor family with a very mean father who views his kids as being put on earth to work and slave for him. Johnny goes into the Air Force, begs his girlfriend to marry him (after they haven't seen each other for 2 years), then, once they are married, doesn't do much to support his family.  His love is music, and he becomes successful.  Someone offers him some sort of illegal pills, telling him \\"Elvis takes them\\", so he says sure, and becomes addicted in short order. Meantime, he cheats on the wife he was dying to marry with groupies and lusts after June Carter. Gets drunk and high, etc. His wife finally gets fed up with his hurtful betrayal and refusal to change, takes the kids and leaves.  June apparently has some sort of savior complex, because she keeps coming whenever Johnny needs her.  She refuses to marry him, but finally gives in when he swears he will stop hurting her as he has previously (after they're married, he sleeps with her sister, but they leave that part out).  What was so great about this guy as a marriage prospect, I couldn't figure out, but he was persistent, I'll give him that. One of those men who always wants what he can't have. And then once he has it, he doesn't want it anymore. In the film, Johnny's dad comes around frequently to make disapproving faces and remind him of his shortcomings, but Johnny is always too wasted to tell him to get lost, and lets his dad push his buttons every time.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix does a pretty good job of looking drugged out and helpless most of the time, and Reese Witherspoon does a great job of acting classy, strong, yet vulnerable. However, there's no real chemistry between them and I just couldn't figure out what June saw in Johnny.  As portrayed in this film, Cash seemed like a pain in the butt to me.

1416905014|5.0|Cinderella picture books are everywhere since Cindy is the perennial favorite fairy tale.  However, Matthew Reinhart illustrates the tale in a new dimension, the third one, in a way we've never seen Cindy before.  He treats us to page after page of animated pop-ups, in the style that has made Robert Sabuda famous, not surprising since they are friends and have colloborated in the past.<br /><br />Cinderella's head peeps from the fireplace, her stepmother's dress tightens as Cinderella pulls on her stays, the carriage sparkles silver with six white horses standing at attention, a black rat changes into a jolly coachman, the couples dance at the ball and Cinderella's finery vanishes at the stroke of midnight all as you turn the page.  There's more than can be listed here and each of these intricate pop-ups have to be seen in action to be truly appreciated.  I'm still going back and finding new details each time I turn a page.<br /><br />The illustrations are loosely lined so the die cutting sometimes blurs the pictures, but there is too much magic in these pages for this to be a big concern.  Of course, the book is not recommended for independent reading for children under five, but this is a book to be shared and loved together.  It will be a bedtime favorite for countless little princesses.<br /><br />My own library, overfilled with Cinderella books, doesn't begrudge the space needed to add this edition to its shelves.  Hopefully we will get more fairy tales done in this style by Reinhart and/or Sabuda.  Don't miss this one!
B000BJS4TO|5.0|Review: Memoirs of a Geisha <br />I don't know why John Williams has taken so much flack this year.  His \\"War of the Worlds\\" was a dark, brutal, brilliant sci-fi action score that took us into the darkest, most primal realm of orchestral music.  Frightening stuff, excellent writing.  \\"Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith\\", again, was, in my opinion, one of the best scores of the series... epic, dark, beautiful, sad... but because it didn't have many truimphant fanfares or passages of sweeping romance, people complained it wasn't as exciting, thus they considered it to be the least of the series.  Now, here's \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\", which is one of the sublest, most intricate, beautiful scores I've heard this year.  I can hear the complaints about this one all ready.  But enough criticism of Williams critics, let's get on to the score, shall we? <br /> <br />The notable element of the score is the pairing of cellist Yo-Yo Ma and violinist Ithzak Perlman, performing together for the first time.  There are no musicians better at these particular instruments then Ma and Perlman.  With William's excellent material to work with, they are even better.  Originally, I suspected that the only reason Williams got them for this score was to get Oscar attention, and that may be true, but they have a genuinely good reason for being here, as well.  They represent two of the film's characters in the film.  The first, and primary theme, is performed often by Ma, for Sayuri, the film's main character.  The theme is slightly darker than one might expect, but nonetheless tender and exquisite.  It appears quite frequently throughout the score, with Ma giving subtle variations on each performance, sometimes accompanied by strings or various ethnic instruments, and sometimes on his own.  The other, less prominent theme is \\"The Chairman's Waltz\\", performed by Perlman on the violin.  While Sayuri's theme is indeed wonderful, \\"The Chairman's Waltz\\" is downright stunning.  The way Williams works with it is fascinating.  It's a waltz that seems poised to build, ready to explode into a sweeping statement by one hundred strings at any moment... but it doesn't.  It builds, and strains, but the only emotional release is granted to Perlman alone, who performs with so much passion and heart that the listener is swept away on a sea of gentle sound.   <br /> <br />There is another, much more playful theme that appears in \\"Going to School\\" near the beginning, and indeed, the score feels a tad lighter in it's opening passages, though not comic in any way.  As it progresses through the mid-section performances of \\"The Chairman's Waltz\\" and head towards the final portion, it grows darker in tone.  Rather than taking things to level of being more intense and brutal musically, ala \\"War of the Worlds\\", Williams makes things even more spare, making the music feel desolate and cold.  \\"The Fire Scene\\" features some a very odd-sounding wailing woman who works quite effectively in context, namely because Williams only utilizes her the one time, rather than over-using her every time something sad happens.  \\"A Dream Discarded\\", performed almost solely by Ma on cello, is a perfect example of musical loneliness, it makes one think of a dead leaf fluttering about in the wind over a barren landscape.  In fact, the instrumentation on most of the score is much sparer than most of Williams work, making it one of his quietest scores.  Williams has a full orchestra at his disposal, but he doesn't use it too often, and he doesn't really use it fully until the end credits, when he presents a variety of fascinating variations on Sayuri's theme.  Most of the time, Williams presents Ma and Perlman with only a little bit of percussion, or chimes, or a few strings.  Also contributing the score on a regular basis are the koto and shakuhachi, giving the score an added feel of authenticism.  Not that Williams needs it, his work his sounds as authentic as anything Tan Dun has written, this isn't oriental music filtered through \\"E.T.\\"   <br />Overall, again, the score is very restrained, and very quiet, one has to listen closely to the score to hear the gentle tapping and plucking going on in the background, and a few sections are barely audible.  The restrained emotions, I suspect, suggest that the film is powerful enough to suggest any emotions that the score refrains from trying to make obvious.  Often a composer will be asked to \\"fill in the gaps\\", providing sweeping, grand emotions to give the movie something it otherwise wouldn't have.  Williams has enough confidence in this film to accentuate the characters, and the subtleties, rather than the scope or the broader ideas of the film.  Obviously, this will make the score a slightly more challenging (though constantly lovely) listen on album.  In terms of actual musical enjoyment, \\"Geisha\\" may rank lower than something like \\"E.T.\\", \\"A.I.\\", or even \\"Seven Years in Tibet\\".  But in terms of writing skill, and of achieving what he attempted, Williams has aced it.  Highly Recommended. <br />Rating as Written for Film: ***** <br />Rating as Heard on Album: **** <br />Overall Rating: ****1/2

068987474X|5.0|I never really noticed how much women really do make excuses for these pathetic men in our lives that treat us like crap until I read this book. Its a very easy read and give examples of all the men they describe. I love Greg Behrendt and his no sugar coating way of explaing how men think. He puts good humor and no-nonsense advice together to make him a very likeable guy. This book really helped me realize what jerks I have around me and that I should not be afraid to raise my standards for myself! It definitely gave me a little boost of confidence and I would recommend this book to any women/girls who are confused about a guy or guys.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Nearly every review I have read about this CD, has reviewed their opinion on Madonna, and not much on the new album. I think this is Madonna's best piece of work to date. She has excelled herself and it is reflected in her songs and her No.1 success of Hung Up in the UK (for two weeks running now). <br />The song Hung Up is not only catchy and samples ABBA, but pays tribute to ABBA and the great disco tracks, as it is so impressive.  <br />And do not think that it is only one standout track, the other 11 tracks are gorgeous, where Madonna flirts with euphoria, electro and gorgeous breakdowns. The lyrics are lovely, the production perfect.  <br /> <br />This is THE album of the year, and of Madonna's career.  <br /> <br />
B00005JMEW|3.0|Well, Kill Bills and okay action movie, and well QT admits to stealing and taking from other movies, but why is this guy considered a genious, i was viewing kill bill for the second time the other day and i was trying to figure out why the hell this director was using certan lighting and dramatic shots for bogus scenes, it seems he does alot of stuff just cause it \\"looks cool\\" and that there is a rape of what his inspirations where trying to establish on screen, there's alot of great work out there and then this guy exploits it. Kill Bill 1 and 2 are good movies but there greatly over exagerated, if any one starts breaking into movie history, directors, (comic books) you'll see that he's not doing anything that hasn't been done, he does good work but i second guess his \\"genious\\" so Kill Bill gets 3 stars
B00014K5TQ|3.0|After watching the origional documentary, this movie is pathethic. Culkin and Green act in such a mincing, sing-song manner that they bare no resemblance to their subjects.    HOWEVER, the movie does have some hidden treasures:    1) You realise, without a shadow of a doubt, that Macauly Culkin CANNOT ACT.    2) Chloe Sevigny has a scene where she's in a small bikini. Trust me, it's worth the rental fee to see it.    3) Marilyn Manson steals the whole movie as a drag queen. Outragious!!    Rent, don't buy.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|System of a Down has long been known for its captivating, experimental and downright quirky metal masterpieces.  From the heavy riffs and intense vocals of their first album to the melodious harmonizing and shifting beats of Mezmerize, they have never failed to bring something new and wonderful with every CD they release.  Hypnotize is no exception, as it continues to build off of and add to those qualities that make System such an amazing band.  Essentially picking up where Mezmerize left off, it immediately shoots into rapid-fire musical intensity characteristic of their early work, but then abruptly cuts to smooth flowing lyrics with an almost pop-like air about them.  But this is just the beginning; soon the songs enter uncharted territory with darker, more sinister chords and lyrics that portray a more sorrowful side of System than they've ever shown before.  When combined with the grave subjects of war and society's deprivation, these tones make Hypnotize an emotional and thought provoking collection of songs, while giving it the most epic feel of any of their albums to date.  Songs like 'Stealing Society' and 'Tentative', which are appropriate placed in the middle of the album, sum up this feeling with lines like \\"two suns / Watching them both fighting\\" and \\"no one's gonna save us now / Not even God\\".  And by the time that the last two songs come around, any remaining hope is utterly destroyed.  The full length version of \\"Soldier Side\\" is the ultimate conclusion to the album, providing the sort of closure that is more characteristic of an \\"end-of-everything\\" or \\"post-apocalyptic\\" tragedy than the finale of a CD.  But the morose attitude that System of a Down conveys throughout much of Hypnotize doesn't prevent them from adding in the purely goofy, nonsensical track \\"Vicinity of Obscenity\\" that follows in the footsteps of 'Cigaro' and 'Chic 'n' Stu' (even though it manages to be more frightening than the predecessors).   Overall, Hypnotize represents the bestand most dramatic of what System has to offer, and it showcases them as a band that's continuously able to evolve and progress to greater, more stupendous heights.  The only downside is that, like Mezmerize, it is less than forty minutes long and leaves the listen begging for more before they've even realized what hit them.
0140187537|4.0|I liked this Steinbeck offering. I liked the fact that it's about small town morality, and ultimately society's morals too. The narrative raises questions about our attitudes towards the mundane and the everyday humdrum things like friendship, honesty, ambition, deception, fidelity, sex, family, avarice, petty corruption and to those of us who fall between the cracks.<br /><br />Okay, so that may sound very traditional and staid, perhaps it isn't sexy enough, but that's exactly why I admire Steinbeck's work. He writes about the real and our day-to-day lives and in this novel he highlights questions of morality through the story of failed businessman Ethan Hawley and New Baytown in late '50s early '60s America.<br /><br />I found it a compelling read, it wasn't an obvious story to tell and so I never really knew where the story was going to turn. It grabbed me with some clever structure and brilliant characterisation. I was particularly struck by the finely observed relationship between that of the protagonist and of his wife Mary, \\"My Mary\\".<br /><br />Steinbeck's power for social realism shone out, describing the life of New Baytown and its occupants in minute detail and through it showing the quiet nobility of ordinary working people. It reminded me strongly of similar evocations in his masterpiece, The Grapes of Wrath.<br /><br />This is a quirky and deceptively well-written book, with snappy dialogue, memorable characters and an intellectual seriousness lying behind the seemingly innocuous events. Recommended.
B000BB1MI2|4.0|It just occured to me that Willy Wonka could've been played by Mike Myers, had Johnny Depp not been Tim Burton's most used actors in his movies. I am not very fond of children's movies, but I had to check this out, because I think Depp is a brilliant character actor and I love Helena Bohem Carter. To my surprise, I actually enjoyed this movie more than I'd expected, and I must say that the set design and special effects are absolute eye-candy! The child actors all tried their best to steal scenes, but Freddie Highmore was most adorable and impressive. Deep Roy managed to stand out from the crowd as the multiple Oompa Lumpa. Helena was severely underused, and I am starting to think maybe she should stop doing this kind of mundane supporting roles, despite she's also Burton's favorite cast. Johnny Depp's bizarre and heavily madeup look is quite striking, even more striking than his roles in Pirates of the Caribbeans and Before Nightfalls. Yes, this is a fast-paced and delicious movie perfect for the whole family.
0689859368|5.0|I kept debating over The Spiderwick Chronicles for a long time - should I get them? Would they be worth it? After I spent two days reading all five, I wish I hadn't waited so long to get my hands on such an excellent series.<br /><br />THE FIELD GUIDE opens out this five-part series incredibly well. We are presented with Jared Grace, an angry young boy whose father has  left the family, and now the Graces are relocating to the ancient Spiderwick Estate. Jared, his twin brother Simon, Mallory, their older sister, and Mrs. Grace all find the old house a little creepy, but move in anyway. What ensues is a terrific romp into fantasy, secret libraries and books, and a mischievous mystery lurking around the Spiderwick mansion.<br /><br />The writing is superb, really stepping up children's literature up a notch. The illustrations are breathtaking - from pictures of little boggarts to the entire Grace family.<br /><br />There is only one objectionable word mentioned (cr*p), but other than this, THE FIELD GUIDE is highly recommended.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Having been a fan of Madonna since the early '90s, I must say that she's no doubt the only artist with the ability to be consistently creative and provocative at the same time. She's always been able to come up with a new look and exciting songs to conquer the music world. No wonder that Sharon Osbourne publicly bashed Madonna's latest look. Madonna doesn't have to look and act like a middle-aged woman if she doesn't want to, and she's got what it takes to be the most drop-dead gorgeous Diva, and I don't think she looks anything like a \\"cheap hooker of the '80s\\"! Just F Off, Osbourne! Unless you can pull off looking fabulous in a dozen differnent looks like Madonna's Cowgirl(Music), Ethnic Goddess(Ray of Light). She doesn't call herself a Material Girl for nothing!<br /><br />I just got Confessions on a Dance Floor yesterday, and listened to it several times. I found myself dancing and shaking my booties all along, no wonder Madonna said that she just wanted to make this to be a complete dance album. It works, and I love several of the tracks including \\"Hung Up\\", \\"Future Lovers\\", and \\"Push\\". I think this album will take the club scene by storm for quite a while, but it doesn't really have the impact of the classic ballads of her earlier works such as \\"You'll See\\", \\"I'll Remember\\", \\"Frozen\\", I wonder if the remixes of this albums will be more exciting and danceable than \\"Ray of Light\\" and \\"Music\\". I think the music in this album is stronger and catchier than the lyrics, which is probably intentional since it's supposed to be a totall dance album.
0553801503|4.0|Like most people who have reviewed this book, I knew going into it that it was only \\"half\\" of a larger book (which will hopefully come out at the end of next year).  Martin tells his story with different POVs- each chapter tells the ongoing story of different characters.  This book features some of my favorites- Brienne, Jaime, Arya and Sansa- but it also misses out on the more \\"action\\" POVs of Jon, Danaerys and Tyrion. <br /> <br />In my opinion, this book had WAY too much Cersei Lannister in it.  She is not an interesting character to me- she's evil, yes, but she's very predictably evil.  She thinks everyone is against her, and so she vows to take revenge on them- not just once, but in every single one of her chapters (and she has a lot- more than anyone else, I think).  It got a little old after a while and I think Martin could have cut some of hers out. <br /> <br />There are also POVs for some new people- we see the Ironmen of Dorne, get a look at Braavos, etc.  Those are interesting to read, but I wish Martin found a way to put them in earlier because by now, I'm so into the characters I've known from the first that I didn't much care about the characters that are being introduced now, half-way through the series. <br /> <br />Did the plot advance a great deal in this book?  It's possible, though I don't think we'll really be able to tell until the other half- A Dance with Dragons- comes out next year.  That way, we can actually read about things only alluded to in this book.  Feast for Crows seems more a transition book- preparing us for what I'm sure will be a shattering, breathtaking climax and resolution in the remaining books of the series.  In that way, I think it is Martin's weakest effort so far- but transition books usually are.  They're not the most exciting to read, but they're important in setting things up for later. <br /> <br />For that reason, I do recommend reading this book- and then reading it again, later, so that you can catch all the stuff you are sure to have missed the first time ;-)  I also recommend reading Storm of Swords before reading this one, just to refresh your memory.  I didn't, and I'm sure I missed a lot of stuff that I would have caught, if I read it.
B00005JO1P|4.0|I must say that while I am not a Country Western music fan, I do love biopics if it's well made. The main appeal of Walk the Line for me is to see the performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon whom I have followed since Legally Blonde. I am not even familiar with any of Johnny Cash's music, and yet I was so dazzled by the singing of his songs done by Phoenix, especially that \\"Ring of Fire\\" song near the end. To my surprise, I was very taken by Phoenix' mesmerizing performance that actually moved me to tears during the time when his character was down and out and recovering from drug addiction. The love and marriage proposal scene was also very touching.<br /><br />This film chronicles the early struggle and triumphs of Cash's life and career as a rebellious country musician in the '50s and '60s. He had three children with his first wife Vivian, but they got divorced dued to his wild and irresponsible behaviors. June Carter(Witherspoon) was the love his life, and it took many years before he pursuaded her to marry him. In the late '50s Cash was at the top of his game, but his drug addiction eventually caused the downfall of his career. His father(Robert Patrick in heavy makeup to look older) alienated him because he blamed him for the death of second son. It had casted shadows over Cash's life ever since. June and Johnny were the best musician duo/lovers and they were destined to become lifelong partners, despite the lack of social acceptances since they had been married to other people previously.<br /><br />Both Withspoon and Phoenix did their own singing and were pretty convincing. It was very natural for Withspoon to deliver her lines in an authentic southern accent. Her June Carter rendition stole numerous scenes and it's certainly her most impressive performance to date. Too bad her role is more of a major supporting role, which limits her chances of getting an Oscar nomination in the best actress cateogory. As for Phoenix, he had obviously transcended the emotions from the death of his brother River into several of the scenes in this film which made it even more powerful and real. He may not become the front runner for the Oscar this year, but a nomination is sure thing.transcended the emotions from the death of his brother River into several of the scenes in this film which made it even more powerful and real.

B000002UJQ|5.0|It's astounding how good this album is. Eight years ago when it came out, I wasn't ready for it. I'm glad I've evolved. There is so much to say about these songs, I wouldn't know where to begin. So I'll keep it brief: \\"Paranoid Android\\" is as beautiful a rock composition as has ever been written. I can't imagine anyone who really, really likes music saying anything negative about this album. So there.
0670033375|3.0|Collapse was certainly informative, well written and interesting. I found the chapters on the Anasazi, Tokogawa Japan and Australia particularly impressive. But. Like many writers, Dr Diamond sees a lot a nails just begging to be smacked by the hammer he's found. In this case, environmental degradation is doom, there's no other doom and the only way to evade the doom (for us) is government edict. Dr Diamond holds up Tokogawa Japan as a success story where goverment controls the useage of key resources and requires the cultivation of replacements (in this case of forests). He ignores the huge example of the power of markets in combination with government to accomplish the same ends, right here at home in the USA.

B00003CXAW|5.0|OK, first off, this dvd is very well done. the picture is grainy is a few areas, but overall the picture quality is excellent, by far the best I've seen. All the restored scenes, mostly of natives and others meeting violent ends, and fay ray getting \\"peeled\\" like a banana are back and great. BUT the lost spider sequence IS NOT reinserted into the film. It is there in the supplemental materials, and is quite interesting, as is the featurette about how peter jackson and his crew made it.  I am not complaining, just letting you know what you are getting.  <br /> <br /> The commentaries are great, but at certain points the comments from Merian C. Cooper, which are snippets of interviews, sound like they are coming from a speaker phone and are hard to hear. The rest of the commentary is great. <br /> <br />also, the sound is not the greatest, but what can you expect from a 70 year old film. You have to keep the volume way up to hear the dialog, and when music kicks in at the high volume it gets a little distorted, as does the dialog at times. <br /> <br />I still give it 5 stars, the negatives are very minor and everything else about the fim is great- there are enough supplemental materials here to keep anyone happy.
0060254920|5.0|Ever wake up mid life and trace some of the earliest inspirations that have shaped who you have grown to become? As I pondered this in recent months, I realized that perhaps this book was one of the core reasons for who I became. <br /> <br />Maurice Sendak created this timeless masterpiece about Max who melts his bedroom walls and journeys to the land where the wild things are. As with the very best of children's literature, this story drives home a core message and through that innate discovery, the root of all of the imaginative world that Sendak surrounds his protagonist in serves to mirror the transformation that his character has journeyed through. <br /> <br />An absolutely timeless allegory, Where The Wild Things Are was perhaps my first exposure to a vibrant imagination that chose to visage the world through very fresh eyes. As I would later found The Illusion Factory and then commence upon creating empowering children's literature with vibrant characters...I looked back and realized that Maurice Sendak and Dr. Seuss were the two men who made an indelible impact on my young mind. <br /> <br />If you are one of the five people on this planet who have never read this book, you should grab the other four and sit down for a mandatory read. Where The Wild Things Are is the benchmark by which all children's illustrated books are measured. <br /> <br />Brian Weiner <br />CEO <br />The Illusion Factory <br />Author, Toad Catchers' Creek
B00006L7XQ|5.0|This CD is incredible, raw, honest almost painful. It is listening to a master using his talent tempered by his experience.

B000BM6AVA|3.0|I was hoping I'd like Hypnotize more than I did Mesmerize, but that doesn't seem to be the case. I'm no crazy only-the-old-stuff-is-good fan, but things just seem to be going downhill with these last two albums. The thing I have always loved about System has been Serj's voice, and there's just less and less of it. Honestly, a lot of this album doesn't even sound like System of a Down to me. Daron's voice annoys the crap out of me; plus, the lyrics seem to be getting more random and dumb. I know they've always been pretty out there, but come on... \\"banana banana terracotta pie\\"? Over and over?<br /><br />I'm giving it another listen now, and I'm starting to like it a little better -- initially the only songs that really grabbed me were \\"Holy Mountains\\" and \\"Soldier Side\\", as compared to the other albums where there are only a few tracks I -don't- like. In general... kind of a disappointment.<br /><br />...and not to be a grammar freak, but the phrase \\"most loneliest\\" irks me so much that I can't listen to that song even though I don't mind it sonically. Auugh.

Seemingly simple, these are complex questions to address. What makes the strategy process a lot easier to work through is the effetiveness of story telling via the strategy canvas. This book is an exceptional contribution to the strategy processes in all organisations, be it profit, government or not-for-profit.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|In my opinion John Mayer has 2 perfect albums, this and \\"inside wants out\\".  Mayer is an extrordinary song writer but he is first and foremost a guitar player.  In 20 years hopefully he will be known as \\"the guitar player\\" of our generation.  This cd is huge, its emotional, its technically sound and it is traditional blues but its not 11 identical songs.  That is where he might have the 1 up on Stevie Ray.  I'm just glad John Alagia didn't ruin this album like he nearly did with room for squares.  Three cheers for John Mayer for being the musician he wants to be and the one he is capable of being.  Fanstastic album!

0142437611|5.0|\\"Seize the day, put no trust in the morrow\\" is what Horace wrote at the end of his first book of Odes a couple of thousand years ago.  And ever since, youth has been urged to make hay while the sun shines since the bird of time is on the wing--to toss in a couple more homilies.  But what Saul Bellow has in mind here is entirely ironic since his sad protagonist, Tommy Wilhelm Adler has never seized the day at all, much to his unfeeling father's disgust.<br /><br />This then is a tale of failure (one of Bellow's recurring themes) and the shame and self-loathing that failure may bring; and yet there is a sense, or at least a hint--not of redemption of course--but of acceptance and understanding at the end of this short existential novel by the Nobel Prize winner.<br /><br />The way that Bellow's drowning, existential man experiences the funeral as this novel ends is the way we should all experience a funeral, that is, with the certain knowledge that the man lying dead in the coffin is, or will be, us.<br /><br />And we should cry copious tears and a great shudder should seize us and we should sob as before God with the full realization that our day too will come, and sooner than we think--which is what big, blond-haired, handsome Jewish \\"Wilkie\\" Adler does.  And in that realization we know that he has seen the truth and we along with him.  An existential truth of course.<br /><br />The structure of the novel, like James Joyce's Ulysses, begins and ends in the same day.  Through flashbacks from Adler's nagging consciousness, the failures and disappointments of his life are recalled.  When he was just a young man he foolishly thought because of his good looks and the assurance of a bogus talent scout that he might become a Hollywood star; and so he spurned college and instead went to the boulevard of broken dreams as it runs toward Santa Monica.<br /><br />And so began the failure and dissolution of his life.  As Bellow tells it, Wilhelm has slipped and fallen into something like a watery abyss.  He can't catch his breath.  He is drowning.  He reaches out to his father, who turns away from him.  He reaches out to Dr. Tamkin, the mysterious stranger, the clever fox of a man who swindles him and then disappears into the crowd of the great metropolis.  He reaches out to his wife, who will also not extend a helping hand.  Meanwhile, the waters about him have grown, and he is lost.<br /><br />We are all lost, more or less, except those who delude themselves, who have their various schemes and delusions to distract them, is what Bellow seems to be saying.  Those of us who have not seized the day, a day that is fleeting and subtle, indefinite and hard to grasp, become so much water-logged driftwood.<br /><br />With resemblances to Albert Camus' The Stranger and Arthur Miller's Willy Loman, Bellow's Wilhelm is the essence of the anti-hero, literature's dominate strain of the mid-twentieth century.  Such men have no firm or deep beliefs.  They exist for the day, like butterflies, tossed about by circumstance all the while wondering why, but without any ability to rise above their predicament, a predicament that is so ordinary, so banal, so patently unheroic to be that of Everyman.<br /><br />And what is the answer?  For Bellow and Camus and Miller, the answer is the finality of death.  A man lives, goes about craving--\\"I labor, I spend, I strive, I design, I love, I cling, I uphold, I give way, I envy, I long, I scorn, I die, I hide, I want\\"--and for what and because of what?  Like the tentmaker, Omar Khayyam, we wander willy-nilly without a clue, and then become so much dust in the wind.<br /><br />For life IS a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying in the end, nothing.  All our labors are like those of Sisyphus pushing the stone up the hill only to watch it roll back down again.<br /><br />We cannot help but feel in reading this novel both a sense of empathy for the man who has failed, but at the same time, we might feel like his father and want to give him a kick and say, \\"Wilkie, get a grip on yourself. Quit making the same mistakes over and over again.\\"<br /><br />But we know that for Wilhelm it is already too late.  He cannot change his nature anymore than the leopard can change its spots.  We sense the great hand of fate upon him, and we shudder.  For in some respects--different respects of course--we could be him.  And we straighten up our frame, we return to our duties and responsibilities, to our work and the rhythms of our lives secure in the knowledge that we are stronger that Wilhelm, that although the waves may toss us about, we will not sink.  At least not yet.<br /><br />In reading this for the first time now half a century after it was written, I am struck with how different the zeitgeist is today.  We have wildly successful heroes and larger-than-life murderous villains, and nowhere is there the existential man.<br /><br />This short work is a splendid representative of one of my favorite genres, the short, sharply focused American novel from the early or middle 20th century.  Other--widely differing--examples are John O'Hara's Appointment in Samarra, Nathanael West's Miss Lonely Hearts, F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, John Steinbeck's Cannery Row and Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea, to name a few.me time, we might feel like his father and want to give him a kick and say, \\"Wilkie, get a grip on yourself.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|I kept missing this when it was on tv as I thought it was the American Civil War \\"North and South,\\" but after reading the very positive reviews on this website, I decided to check it out.  And I am so glad I did.  This is an excellent production and the actors are brilliant.  I was very tired when I began watching and couldn't sleep until I finished viewing it entirely.  It's the kind of story that can be viewed over and over again - simply excellent.
B000000OU6|4.0|4. 5 Stars<br /><br />Slash...a guitarist that needs no introduction. In the late 80s, while rock was up to its waist in Eddie Van Halen clones, Slash brought the classic sound of Joe Perry and Jeff Beck back in style. His playing thrilled and captivated a generation of fans. His signature top-hat and dangling cigarette became synonymous with cool.  As the lead guitarist for Guns N' Roses ('85-'93) he was more than just a guitar hero, he was a pop-cultural icon.<br /><br />Fast-forward to 2004. Almost a full decade after the demise of the original Guns N' Roses, Slash makes a huge comeback with his new band Velvet Revolver. But what about the ten years between Guns N' Roses and Velvet Revolver?<br /><br />When (then) Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash went into the studio to record \\"It's Five O' Clock Somewhere,\\" (1995) it was not initially supposed to be a solo project or a new band. Anxious to get back on the road with a new album, Slash recorded a batch of new songs and presented them to Axl Rose as the follow-up to the \\"Use Your Illusion\\" (1991) albums. Much to Slash's disappointment, Slash claims the material was shot down by Rose as sounding \\"too retro.\\" (NOTE: In Rose's defense, he claims he would have worked with the material, as it had potential.) Not wanting to waste the songs, Slash formed a new band to finish the material and release an album. Slash retained (then) Guns N' Roses drummer Matt Sorum and rhythm guitarist Gilby Clarke, who had just recently left GN'R. Alice In Chains bassist Mike Inez and the unknown vocalist Eric Dover rounded out the band.<br /><br />In the early days of post-grunge, when old-school guitar AOR was all but left-for-dead, \\"It's Five O' Clock Somewhere\\" was a complete throwback to 70s/80s arena style rock. Lyrically, however, the album's themes; death, nihilism, defeatism, completely fit the cynical 1990s. In short, it was an old-school sounding rock album updated for the times. Released in early '95, Slash called \\"It's Five O' Clock Somewhere,\\" (paraphrasing) \\"the alternative to alternative.\\"<br /><br />Eric Dover, with his whiskey-stained raspy vocals, is a good, if not great singer. While some have criticized him as a \\"second rate-Axl Rose,\\" this critique isn't really fair. While Dover is no Rose, he gets the job done.  The underrated Gilby Clarke proved to be an able gunner as Izzy Stradlin's replacement on the \\"Use Your Illusion\\" tour and \\"The Spaghetti Incident\\" (1993) covers album. Clarke also proved to be a gifted songwriter with his excellent debut \\"Pawnshop Guitars\\" (1994). While it's a shame Clarke was never afforded the opportunity to write with GN'R, his contributions to the Snakepit album was the next best thing. While Slash is no doubt the star of \\"It's Five O' Clock Somewhere,\\" Clarke thickens the sound and is a more-than-able player. Sorum and Inez proved to be a first rate rhythm section.<br /><br />Like any great band, Guns N' Roses was the sum-total of all its parts. Izzy brought in a Stones/Faces classic rock element, Duff brought in a tad of punk, and Axl provided a grand artistic vision. With Slash, it was all about the blues-based, kick-ass screeching guitars. So while Slash's Snakepit was band on paper, it was really just a showcase to let Slash do his thing.<br /><br />While Slash is undoubtedly a great guitarist, he is in all honesty, not the greatest songwriter in the world. Slash needs a foil like Axl Rose or Scott Weiland to help channel and craft his songs. Minus a Rose or a Weiland, \\"It's Five O' Clock Somewhere\\" doesn't quite have songs as memorable or well-crafted as Guns N' Roses or Velvet Revolver. Be that as it may, \\"It's Five O' Clock Somewhere\\" does have killer riffs and solos. In fact, \\"It's Five O' Clock Somewhere\\" features some of Slash's best riffs and solos he's ever recorded. The Slash element, so prevalent and essential to the sound of classic Guns N' Roses, is in full-front-and-center throughout this album.<br /><br />Slash is a great player because, unlike so many guitar heroes, he's not just another self-indulgent wannabe Eddie Van Halen. A blues-based player, he plays straight from the heart. If you're a fan of Slash's work with Guns N' Roses and Velvet Revolver, you don't want to miss out on this album, as it contains some of Slash's best work.t another self-indulgent wannabe Eddie Van Halen.

B000001FRY|5.0|This is where it all began.  A classic album from the best band of all time.  This debut album from U2 is simply amazing.  From the opening \\"I Will Follow\\" (my personal all time favorite) to the closing \\"Shadows and Tall Trees\\", there isn't a dud to be found.  Lesser-known songs like \\"Twilight\\", \\"Stories for Boys\\", and \\"Another Time, Another Place\\" simply rock.  \\"Electric Co.\\" and \\"Out of Control\\" are downright awesome.  If you're starting a U2 collection, look no further than right here.  Buy this now!  You will not be disappointed.  Personally my favorite of all U2 albums.  Most will say  \\"The Joshua Tree\\" or \\"Achtung Baby\\".  My vote is for \\"Boy\\".
B00005LC1H|5.0|I have seen the British series, Black Adder, and I definitely like Fawlty Towers better. This is what I call intelligent comedy as contrasted with the surfacy silly crapp we get so much during Prime Time TV. You know, boy and girl joke about stupid stuff. Having said this, you must understand that I am also a major fan of Three's Company which doesn't take much of a brain to appreciate! If you like Three's Company and Peter Seller's Pink Panther you will frikkin' love Fawlty Towers.
B000B7BRMM|2.0|Having heard of Diana Krall from friends that are fans, but never having listened to her music, I thought this would be a nice addition to our family's christmas collection.  After 3 or 4 listens I can say it's just ok.  There aren't any standout tracks here and it just isn't very much fun.  I might add a song or two to a christmas mix but don't think I would put this disc in just to listen to on its own.  If I had been a fan of Ms. Krall I suppose I would have known what to expect, but there isn't anything here that would entice me to spend any more time or money on her music.
B00000294R|5.0|Ok folks I am normally a west coast gangsta fan, but after listening to 50 cent's get rich or crap trying soundtrack, I had to come back and look at the reviews for this one.  The funny thing is that here in November 2005, TEN YEARS after this album came out, there are still 4 reviews in the same month.  That goes to show how classic this one is, and how the east coast has gone downhill in the past few years.  I can barely listen to anything from the west coast except Jigga anymore, or a couple of the Wu-tang solo albums (old Genius, Ghostface, etc).. but Big L belongs right up there with the greats, and somehow he never got famous.  Too bad.. this is a tight CD.. worth your money.

We did not get her body back until Nov. 18.  All this time we have been searching and grieving.  For the memorial service my granddauther wrote the euolgy and started it with \\"I'll love you forever / I'll love you for always / As long as I'm living / My baby you'll be.\\"   My mom read this to me every night etc.  And at the end, with everyone crying and hearts breaking, she read \\"I'll love you forever / I'll love you for always / As long as I'm living / My mommy you'll be.\\"   When she went to the flooded house recently she found the book, wet, nasty with mud, but she found the book she treasured to remember her mom.
B000063CMK|5.0|My favourite Pain of Salvation album, also my favourite album of all time. Remedy Lane is dark, emotive, beautiful, dealing with subjects such as suicide, love, despair, miscarriage, and a trip into a painful past. <br /> <br />Why is it my favourite? First, the production is great. No more muddy tones such as in Perfect Element I. Second, the humanity of the subjects clicks with me very well. Don't get me wrong. 'Be' is good as a philosophical piece, but Remedy Lane's lyrical subjects, music strikes the deeper (and deepest chord) compared to all of their other albums. <br /> <br />Let me touch on Gildenlow. Amazing singer, truly unique, and the only singer I have ever heard to truly use his voice as an instrument. The weird sounds he makes, as mentioned by another reviewer, just enhances Remedy Lane for me. He is on top form here, and backed by an excellent vocalist with complex, deep and stirring music - How could Remedy Lane be anything short of a masterpiece?

B000021XS0|4.0|Now this review may upset alot of you guys. But be open-minded about it, this is after all my personal view. You can take it or leave it. <br /> <br />My general first impression of this album was WOW! Back then, I was mainly listening to metal types such as Metallica and Sonata Arctica, and huge doses of commercial drivel branded as music. I simply had no idea such works (and shreddery :P) existed. <br /> <br />However my tastes soon expanded greatly, discovering many varied bands, many in progressive music, and right now I must say, I still feel this is a very good release here by DT. There is not a weak song on this album. However it has lost its WOW factor for me. Now this is not in anyway due to my expanded taste. I always feel music should be judged solely by itself and not comparatively. <br /> <br />SFAM is a continuation of Metropolis part 1 from their 1992 Images and Words album. Musically, they retain alot of the sound from that song. However, my grouse with this is that in keeping with the progressions of Metropolis 1, sections such as Dance of Eternity sound contrived and structured instead of a creative outburst. Full power to DT for these sections, but it doesn't strike me as particularly engaging. Also, after listening to it for more than 4 times, there's only a few songs that engage me (Fatal Tragedy, Home). <br /> <br />A very solid release by Dream Theater, definitely shows why they are the commercial giants of progressive music. But their technical ability has Malmsteen-ed them, making virtuosity an end rather than the means. And it shows in pointless solos such as in Beyond This Life. <br /> <br />Conclusion? Buy it, enjoy it. But realise and recognise also what SFAM could have been if Dream Theater had fully let go (not technically, but musically!)
B000BM6AVA|3.0|Let's put it this way...\\"Mezmerize\\" is clearly the superior Album of the two music wise. That said, this CD has it's up's, and down's, but mostly it's in the middle. It's not good, it's not bad. <br /> <br />As for it's \\"politics\\" and lyrics? The problem I have with System, is that I have heard the same lyrics in half of their songs already. I know it's the \\"cool thing to do\\" to rip on the President and the war (no matter how much each side spins it) but the act is getting old...not only from this band, but every other one. <br /> <br />Your entertainers...entertain me, don't lecture me. That goes for Republican entertainers, and Democratic entertainers.
0140149295|5.0|I bought this book my sophomore year of high school and that was over 7 years ago.  It has literally been my bible to life.  Rubin and his book have changed my life more than anything else I have ever encountered.  Too often than not we find false heroes in this world.  People like Paris Hilton who some look up to as a hero or a role model, but the true heroes in this life are often over looked or never seen at all.  Rubin Carter is a true hero, I have never even heard of such a troubled life an to come out on top both a champion of his sport and one in life.  A wise man told me once that it is now how we live this life but what we do during it.  If your looking for a uplifting book of a true hero an a book that will give you strength when all doubt you, this is the one.

0151008787|5.0|Generally, in interviews, etc., Oz is a bit cryptic about his own life, but in this memoir, a coming-of-age story of both a writer and a nation, his honesty and vulnerability are truly remarkable. A brief aside on translation--de Lange, as he's done with Oz's novels, does a marvelous job here. I usually read first in Hebrew, then in English, but this version is so seamless that the English reader will not suffer or miss out. I found the story of his relationship with his beautiful, despairing mother fascinating, and very revealing regarding the writer's attitude towards women in his novels. When I finished, I was so moved that I sat down and wrote the author a letter (albeit unsent), which I haven't done since childhood in Israel. There's an honesty in this book, an awareness of the fragility of memory, of love, of the tremendous need we all have for forgiveness, for connection over time and to each other. If you haven't read Oz's work, you can still learn from this memoir, though knowledge of his fiction will deepen your appreciation. A beautifully written, soul-searching book, highly recommended.
B000BB1MI2|2.0|All this movie does is cause you at every scene to recall the superiority of the original.      Johnny Depp is NOT FUNNY, or cute. or mysterious, or charming, just creepily weird, and absolutely not in any kind of enjoyable way.  Gene Wilder played the part with requisite weirdness, but it was like a starry-eyed mad scientist poet that was at once bequiling and enchanting.      This is Michael Jackson weird, this is I-can't-imagine-a-parent-turning-their-back-for-a-second-when-he's-near-your-child weird.  He plays Wonka like a jaded preteen outcast aspiring homosexual who is mildly autistic. Quite unpleasant and NOT FUNNY.  If you found this to be funny you may be succumbing to some kind of group pressure, and you may want to check to see if your one of those people who always turn to make eyecontact after a 'funny part' for confirmation.      First Mistake: remaking an incredible movie.    Second Mistake: Tim Burton?! He is WRONG WRONG choice  Third Mistake: Casting, from top to bottom, every character pales in comparison to their forerunner.     1 stars for the kid with the ridiculous braces.    Actually the DVD messed up about 2/3 through, and I was kind of relieved that I could get some credit back at Hollywood Video and I didn't have to finish it.
B000B8QEZG|3.0|\\"Hung Up\\" is the best track on the album.  It kicks things off perfectly and is bound to be added to her ever growing cataloge of classics.  Continuing on, things run at a steady pace if not reaching the heights of \\"Hung Up\\".  But from \\"Forbidden Love\\" on the album looses its sparkle.  Where is the personality that grabbed us into such hits as \\"Burning Up\\" and \\"Frozen\\"?  Where is the unabashed enjoyment of dance we heard on \\"Holiday\\" and \\"Music\\"?<br /><br />Confessions might get you moving, but you will quicly tire of the slow, restrained beats and inane or obtuse lyrics that run rampant like a virus on the second half of the album.  Even worse, precious few tracks will stay in your mind past the dance floor.  Remember when Madonna's music was infectionus?  I was expecting joyful dance music on this album.<br /><br />At best, this is a mixed bag.  A sad let-down from the former queen of the dance floor.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This movie is the most imaginative and creative piece of work I have ever seen.  It is a visual feast and an emotional journey.  I really loved the English voiceovers too!  This is one of the very few DVD's that I chose to purchase after I watched it (rented), because I know I will watch it many, many times, and try to get other people to watch it too.

B000069AUI|3.0|No matter how beautiful the song \\"Amsterdam\\" and a few select others are, they simply would not exist without Radiohead.  People try to defend Coldplay and say they only sound like Radiohead because of the vocals...  seriously, just listen to the two bands and respect both... no matter how great some parts of this Coldplay album are, it takes too much from Radiohead.  This is my opinion, from someone hearing and loving Coldplay before I knew Radiohead existed: Radiohead just does their sound better than Coldplay.  Of course, how can you perfect a sound someone else created?  It kind of dissapoints me that Coldplay's gotten so much fame from Radiohead. <br /> <br />\\"Let's see 'em try 'Kid A'\\" -Thom Yorke

B000021YQV|5.0|I dont understand people.  Every single soad song is amazing.  I dont get people they give the cd five stars, say soad is awesome, that this cd is awesome, and then they go through and give about half of the songs 5 or 6 out of 10.  No System of a Down song deserves anything lower than an 8. They're the most amazing band out there. They play what they want and are so different from anything out there. How anyone can say they suck or they sound like anyone else is beyond me. There is no comparison to them. They are not nu-metal, heavy metal, hard rock, or whatever anyone else says. They are their own genre. I know of few, if any, bands that are out there doing what soad is doing. They have given us 5 amazing albums, each one unique. None of them are boring or sound old. They are all fresh and wonderful. System of a down is the best band out there. <br />Buy this cd and anything else system of a down puts out. <br />
B00005AWMF|5.0|Folks...the big hits are here...just buy it and enjoy...critics criticize her voice.  Here's the point: Sade is a singer that you would expect to see in some dark club, somewhere in the red light district of Paris, or on the East End of London, or on Imperial Hwy in L.A.  Don't try to make her Barbara Streisand, you can't!  Don't try to compare the two, you can't!  Her style isn't unique, it's been done before.  But, just listen to her songs, she is a lady that is trying to tell you something that you should be able to relate to!  For this re-mastered collection, five stars...go get 'em Sade!
B000B8QEYC|1.0|After a five-year interval, Enya disappoints with her weakest album to date. I have been a devoted admirer of the Irish singer since \\"Orinoco Flow\\" first hit the airwaves years ago, and have eagerly awaited each and every offering, including her singles, which oftentimes contain extra bonus tracks that turn out to be mini-masterpieces. I understand how many critics brush her aside claiming that her music is too artificial, too cold, too computer generated to stir genuine emotions, and with those criticisms I strongly disagree, until now. True, you buy an Enya album because it sounds like an Enya album. No matter how many years go by in between, songs are frequently interchangeable from one CD to the next, and that's okay. Enya's strength lies in the perfect blending of her unique voice and her music, and the magic that she creates with them in the studio-intricate spider's webs of fragile melodies and haunting refrains. <br />  But the magic is absent from \\"Amarantine\\". <br />  The entirety of the album's brief 45 minute running time is, to put it simply, exceedingly dull. Instead of spirited, otherworldly, evocative songs, this album flows by lugubriously, and depressingly. The songs are pallid and barely stick in the brain. Only the title track-a word whose definition along with being a vibrant shade of red, means to be everlastingly youthful or beautiful-has sparks of that once Enya allure. Even the lone instrumental piece, \\"Drifting\\" is ponderous and pales in the light of other such previous wordless tracks as \\"A Day Without Rain\\", \\"Tea House Moon\\", or \\"Watermark\\". <br />  Enya's \\"sound\\" is also different. True, there's nothing wrong with expanding or growing as an artist, but as the old saying goes: \\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\\". Some decision seems to have been made to push Enya's vocals to the forefront, instead of having them interwoven with the music itself as displayed magnificently on her past recordings. For Enya, this album is almost acoustic, theexquisite flair missing, her voice too front and center, making some of the tracks, especially \\"Someone Said Goodbye\\" and \\"A Moment Lost\\" seem like songs that wafted in through her castle window from someone else's country album. On the whole, \\"Amarantine\\" feels cobbled together, as if from bits and pieces left over from other recording sessions and rightfully discarded. <br />  Too sad... <br />  Again, I am a devoted Enya fan, but this album was certainly not worth the wait. Hopefully, we will not have to wait another five years to hear the true Enya sound reemerged. <br />   <br />
B00005V9QJ|4.0|Normally, I don't enjoy \\"live\\" albums due to the fact that the audience \\"gets in the way\\" of the music.  But, still, I was pleased with the effort that Sade and her band put out.  A very well done, well crafted album.  Obviously, she gave the audience their money's worth, and they appreciated her effort.  So do I!!  The only reason why I didn't give this album five stars was the fact that she left out some very key hits from her early work that should have been included: \\"Hang on to your love, Your love is King(among others)\\"  Still, it gets Four Stars!!!!
B000BO0LKY|4.0|I used to like Mariah a lot when she was classy.  The admiration pretty much died when Glitter and Rainbow came out.  A lot of people thought Charmbracelet was going to be her comeback album but it wasn't. So when The Emancipation of Mimi was hyped up as another comeback album, I had my doubts.  (C'mon, only Cher could have this many genuine comebacks.)  After a certain amount of skepticism and extensive research, I decided to buy the album after it had been released for 7 months.  (I didn't even know I bought a platinum edition until I got home.)  I have to say it is better than I expected.  (And I didn't expect much at all.)  Most of the songs are melodic and catchy.  She even went back to the '80 and '90 sounds in some of the songs and pull it off quite well.  The lyrics are just poorly written and often don't rhyme well.  But to her defense, you can't really find good lyrics in pop songs these days so Mariah is not that bad compared to the current sad standards.<br /><br />The best feature of this album, in my opinion, is Mariah's voice.  Granted, it's not as crisp and resonant as it was in the first few albums but it is far better than the mumbling and throaty whispering she did in Rainbow and Charmbracelet.  Sometimes she goes for too much (as in 'We belong together' and 'Mine again') and it shows.  Nonetheless, I'd rather hear the crackling high notes than murmuring without effort.<br /><br />The four songs that are included in this special edition are nothing special.  'Don't forget about us' is mediocre and sounds awfully similar to 'We belong together'.  Of the four, only the remix of 'We belong together' interests me.  That's simply because it elaborates more on the Bobby Womack and Babyface references that I didn't quite get on the original album version.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good to very good album.  It shows effort on Mariah's part to do better.  One observation, though.  Lots of the songs are about unsuccessful consummation of love and mostly about being dumped by some guy.  If she's really happily emancipated, why not sing songs about jubilation and not about bereavement.  Perhaps the album should be instead named 'The defection of Mimi'tly about being dumped by some guy.  If she's really happily emancipated, why not sing songs about jubilation and not about bereavement.  Perhaps the album should be instead named 'The defection of Mimi' <br />
0688170528|1.0|At first, I had a hard time putting this book down because I was compelled to find out why Emily wanted to kill herself and whether she eventually revealed those reasons to Chris; I continued to read it after I began feeling uncomfortable hoping the author would somehow curb my feelings. She didn't.  <br />WARNING: AM REVEALING PLOT:  <br />Chris and Emily's relationship was unnatural and disturbing. While I was reading, all I could envison was my daughter and nephew growing up together(2 months apart and very close). When the relationship turned sexual in the book, I felt sick.  <br />The subtitle \\"A Love Story\\" is especially upsetting. Once the reader understands that Emily feels trapped by Chris and is more or less sickened by their sexual relationship, I feel it is inappropriate. Chris, who was supposedly so in-tune with her feelings, seems to purposely ignore her fairly obvious signs of discomfort. Towards the end, it felt abusive. Combine that with her flashbacks of abuse that she seems to link with her sexual encounters with Chris, and I walked away from this novel very disturbed.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|Been a fan since their first album. In my own opinion, all of them are great despite some peoples opinions. But, this one hits a chord for me. I absotudely love it. If you have not had the chance to see them live,...do it! Just saw them in Seatown, unbelievable! SOAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I wasn't surprised that I enjoyed this movie as much as I did because it was written and directed by the brilliant Joss Whedon, who created the \\"Firefly\\" TV series as well as two of the best series ever on television, \\"Buffy The Vampire Slayer\\" and \\"Angel\\". Though the movie was two hours long, I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it, never losing interest. It's a rare movie that can make you laugh, while keeping you tense, and show you loyalty and love at it's best along with absolute despair and the worst of human nature. This is a well-written, well-casted movie that stands out as more than just another sci-fi flick. It's intelligent, emotional, charming and thought-provoking and the leading man, Nathan Fillion is wonderful to watch.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Horrible!  I wish I wouldn't have spent the money on this CD.  Probably one of her worst CD's.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Why did this show have to start at 7 on Fridays.  I wanted to watch it when it premiered... but who's the idiot that picked that time slot? <br />I can't get enough of the series and am looking forward to the movie.
B000BKJ78U|1.0|I didn't mind when Lucas came out last year with the extended re digitalized set, but this is just too much. Frankly I'm not happy with this because the box is definatly cooler then the old one. Who wouldn't want the original picturing on their box of star wars? But the fact remains that Lucas is squeezing the life from the trilogy by reselling and reselling the old material in new packaging. When will he stop? Maybe start giving us newer editions of Indiana Jones instead.<br /><br />Buy this edition if you haven't already been scammed into buying his last year edition. Like I said, the box is definatly way cooler, but the principles that Lucas is displaying is sorry indeed for the market, heck forget the market. What about us poor college buyers that would kill for this edition?
B000002TQV|5.0|What a classic album! The best psychedelic alternative cd of all times. This album changed everybody's perception about how alternative music can be portrayed with a suicidal touch....
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Love actually is likely one of the sweetest, most beautiful love stories to have come out in years. Although its rather like Pulp fiction in the way that you have at least several different stories being told at the same time, before tying altoghether.<br /><br />With an allstar british cast of Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Martin Freeman, Bill Nighy, Keira Knightly, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson and Rowan Atkinson its easy to see why this movie is so good. Yet another wonderful movie from the writer of Bridget Jones Diary. Highly reccomand it for a feel-good christmas movie, and if not for christmas at least for a beautifully romantic dream come true of a movie.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing!!! I've been a System fan since they first started out and all their albums are so unique and fantastic. Hypnotize is no different...and if you consider it as one album along with Mezmerize (which yous should) it is definately one of the best albums of the year!  <br /> <br />
0767817478|4.0|I am a HUGE Godzilla fan.<br />This movie is not all that bad.<br />It does not have the charm of the early G-films but it is alot better that than Everything in between \\"Destroy all Monsters\\"-1967 and \\"Godzilla vs. Biolante\\"1989.<br />Have some fun and don't be overly critical- thats what Godzilla movies are all about.<br />If this film were to be titled something other than Godzilla,  I guarantee that all the Godzilla fans would have loved this.
B000BGH22W|5.0|I was wary when I first heard John Williams would not be back to score the film.<br /><br />His Harry Potter theme is awesome, and essentially is the heart of the story. Thankfully, Patrick Doyle recreated his own vision beautifully, and still managed to keep the overall theme brought to life by John Williams.<br /><br />The tracks are darker in tone, just like the movie, but also have their own feel to them.  I especially enjoy \\"Foriegn Visitors Arrive\\", \\"The Quidditch World Cup\\", and the \\"Hogwarts March\\".<br /><br />It's a great soundtrack, especially for any diehard Harry Potter fans....The melodies are also very beatiful to listen to, even though they come in short bits.
B000BGH22W|5.0|I was surprised when I heard John was not going to do the soundtrack of Goblet, which was by far the best of the Potter films by the way, so I was a little iffy about it.<br /><br />After buying it though, I loved it. Patrick Doyle's slow songs were heartwarming and his angstier songs were really terrifying, expemplifying the mood of the film excellently.<br /><br />HIghly recommended. And even though John was not in here, you can still feel his presence somehow.
0060090367|5.0|Marian Keyes has a knack for knowing what women want to read and writing it with sass and spunk.  This book was at times heartbreaking and heartwarming with a generous dash of humor sprinkled throughout.  But what is more, the characters are so fun and so well scripted that the reader can sympathize with any and all of them, which makes for a truly engaging read.<br /><br />Claire Webster has been dumped, in the worst sense of the word.  Just hours after going through agony (the worst PMS you've ever had, times a thousand, thank you very much) and giving birth to a perfect baby girl, her husband James informs her briskly that he is having an affair and he is leaving.  When suddenly her life comes crashing down around her, what's a girl to do?  Go home...to Dublin!<br /><br />Unfortunately, home comes equipped with two neurotic sisters (one chemically induced) and two well meaning, if sometimes inappropriate, parents.  Upon returning to Ireland, Claire goes through a phase of utter despair, involving maximum alcohol and minimal bathing.  Thankfully, with the help and encouragement of her family, Claire pulls through and begins taking care of herself and her beautiful baby girl.  It is around this point that a gorgeous man named Adam breezes into the family abode.<br /><br />A tumultuous and whirlwind emotional encounter between the three (Claire, Adam, and baby Kate) ensues, utterly drawing the reader in.  Amidst all this, Claire's estranged husband James reenters her life, letting her know in no uncertain terms that his affair is over and it is time for her to come back home.  This turmoil between duty, passion, and love creates a wrenching peak of the book, one that will have readers fuming, crying, and perhaps laughing a little.<br /><br />With her usual sense of style, Marian Keyes creates a wacky world of family love and creates in her heroine a strong and utterly believable woman.  All the characters help draw the audience into the story, but the plot is what keeps them turning the pages.  I adored this book and read it in one sitting, and it was one of those books that made me smile and made me cry.  That is what makes 'Watermelon' worth a read (or two!)is what keeps them turning the pages.

B000BM6AVA|4.0|Disappointing. It's as if they put all their good songs on Mezmerize and the 12 leftovers on Hypnotize.<br /><br />- Hypnotize's songs don't even come close to the intensity of Mezmerize and Toxicity. Sometimes the songs are even mellow sounding.<br />- The songs are more political, and there's lots of words, and it  could sound better<br />- I could handle Daron's voice in Mezmerize, but he doesn't even try to sing in Hypnotize. Serj isn't as good as before either.  It's just different<br />- In Mezmerize, when Serj and Daron sung together there was amazing harmony and counterpoint. In Hypnotize, sub-par.<br /><br />FINAL THOUGHT: The songs aren't that bad really...it's just that Mezmerize and Toxicity are too good.
B000002LND|5.0|Ever since she first arrived in 1983, she's been shocking, engaging and posing her way through showbiz.  She started out really cute - remember Borderline? - then she got into this whole Papa Don't Preach phase, so basically, I'm a teenager now and I have the right the screw up my life in whichever way I choose - then she started getting a little more erotic and begging everyone to quickly follow suit and Express Themselves. Who is she? I'll give you three guesses. Yep you got it in one - she's Madonna.  She can be seen prancing around in earlier videos like she's Marilyn Monroe - that was when she was feeling a bit Like A Virgin - then she changed her mind and decided it was more Like A Prayer - and it was a prayer that would take you there. Phew! Over 17 sparkling songs, we this see this Madonna changing from an innocent young girl into a passionate young woman. Whether it be philosophical - we're living in a material world you know - exotic, like a beautiful island - or downright joyful like a holiday - we can always count on Madonna to be bringing pop music to a higher level. Score: 17/17
B000002BPS|5.0|I love this album. The Offspring is a great band, and this one came after their commercial smash...uh...\\"Smash\\". Although no song here really can match the catchyness of 'Come Out and Play', or 'Self Esteem', they are great fun to listen to. The music is verried in style. From mid 90's post-grunge, to hardcore punk, to...shudder....ska. The guitars are very loud and the drumming and bass are very heavy and in your face. The lyrics are great. They range from lost love, searching, and angst. People who say that 'Me & My Old Lady' is the only weakness on this album are plain wrong. That song is one of the best, and most fun to listen to. It isn't the last great Offspring album, either. \\"Americana\\" came out a year after this, and it sucked, granted. \\"Conspiracy of One\\" however is another Offspring masterpiece. Check that one out, too.  <br />Album highlights <br />Me & My Old Lady - awsome guitars and drumming <br />Gone Away - great slower tempo song <br />I Choose - a great song about making your own choises and not being a follwer <br />Amazed - awsome song;l the best one, actually <br />Change the World - awsome intro. very fast song <br />Great buy
B000BBOUU4|1.0|Well what kind of message is this sending to our children? 'Charlie and the Chocolate factory?' I wouldn't be suprised if we see a surge of child obesity and a decline of dental hygiene! Why not 'Charlie and the apple tree?' That'd be wholesome!  <br />Also the obvious undertones to the story left a less than sweet taste in my mouth.  <br />The children who won the truckloads of chocolate  would have died of obesity, or a massive heart attack.  <br />Wonka's obvious peadophilic intentions of drawing children into his enclosed factory, treating them and dazzling the parents with chocolate waterfalls and tiny clones.  <br />And the blatant ploy by Wonka to get up slumped sails by sending out golden tickets was such a transparent marketing technique. <br />Overall, i give this movie a one. Although i did enjoy the puppets getting incinerated. I hate puppets.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|I heard of SoaD back when the made Toxicity, but never picked them up. I bought Mezmerize, and hated it. The vocals turned me off the most, but the music was very good, so I listened to it, and it grew on me. When I first listened to this album, the vocals, again, set me back...but they actually fit the type of music being played. The songs on here are short and sweet. 'Holy Mountains' is the longest song, and one of the best tracks on here. 'Tentative' and 'Hypnotize' are the best on this album. In fact, all of these songs are good. And even the sub-par ones, have awsome ten second intros. The different intros to each song are what kept me listening to this.  Darron's vocals (the really high pitched ones) can get a little annoying, but Serj's are very deep and menacing. The lyrics are very unorthadox. \\"Bannana ,Bannana, Bannana, Bannana, Tarakata, Tarakata, Pie.\\" goes 'Vicinity of Obscenity'. Wierd, yes, but when listened to in it's entirety, you relize what this song is about, and its the main reason this album has a Parental Advisory. Great song. The lyrics also steer away from \\"Mezmerize\\"'s political activism. 'B.Y.O.B.' and 'Question!' were very politically driven, but the only political song on here is 'Soldier Side'. I like that they steer away from that theme.   Overall, this is a much better effort then \\"Mezmerize\\". Better music, better lyrics....better album art.  As a stand alone album, 5/5  but as a double album, with \\"Mezmerze\\", as it was intended, it gets a 4/5.  Solid effort.
B00005RDRO|5.0|This movie includes an all star cast portraying different famous detectives- Sam Spade, Jessica Marples, Hercule Peroit, and Sidney Wang, searching for some answers when invited to a mansion of their soon to be deceased host. Locked in the house, they must find out who done it? who are the staff? whats for dinner?. With stuffed mooses that stare, rooms decked in spun sugar cobwebs, and a ready to assemble maid in a trunk, each scene has some quirk that seems to make sense to one of the detectives...but nothing to the viewer.  All in all the movie is more of a parady of mystery stories and detectives, how their cases were always so complex, and how they never seemed to make complete sense...until of course the end. Be surprised though, this ending makes little sense either, but in a good way.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album beats all previous albums by Madonna! She's outdone herself! I am so amazed by the whole album, it's very trance / disco. She knows how to make people dance! This album makes you happy! I find it very interesting that Hung Up, at least in my opinion, doesn't seem to fit in properly among the other songs although I absolutely love the song anyway, and of course it deserves to be on the album. The way she has mixed all the songs together is great! Listening to this album will take to to another world. My favourite song on the whole album is \\"I Love New York\\". She rocks! I was very curious about \\"Isaac\\", since there's been so much controversy about it. I was blown away, that's one of my other favourites on the album. It's absolutely beautiful. There isn't a single weak track on this album. I give it 11/10!!! MADONNA ROCKS!!
B000B8QF00|4.0|Having known Alanis as a big haired anthem singer at sporting events back in the late 80's/early 90's, this collection of tunes is a far cry from that.<br /><br />Some hot shot of a producer saw her raw talent and decided to mould her into a greasy haired I hate the world and most men chick singer. With this bold statement (although it made some of us who knew her laugh at the time!!), she has transformed a once stagnant career into what she had sought, fame and fortune.<br /><br />Alanis has worked hard for what she has make no mistake about that and this greatest hits collection confirms that. From her grunge I hate men first release to her latest effort the cohesiveness is here. Theirs no doubt she has grown leaps and bounds in terms of song writing over the years.<br /><br />All of the tunes on here are very good and yet are very different. She even has a Zeppelin sounding tune that is my personal favourite. I will say that I am not a big Alanis fan, I do not have her entire collection, however I have heard enough of her work over the years to know that what we have here is a very solid best of!!<br /><br />For the casual fan of the lady like myself, this is all you need!!
B00000K413|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite albums. This was one of the albums from your youth that you could have sworn was written by your own soul. The only thing I feel that is missing from the [UK Bonus Tracks] is the extended single of \\"Suffer The Children\\". I have it on LP, but since I do not have a turn-table anymore I am forced to sit and stare at the sleeve and only wish that I could put it onto my I-Pod. If anyone knows if it is available on disc feel free to let me know.
0792843584|4.0|Many cinema fans know of or have heard of the \\"Legend of Heaven's Gate\\"; huge flop, out of control director, bankrupted the studio, etc...  If you are interested enough in the movie to consider buying the DVD, then you are prepared to look past the legend and get to the real story.<br /><br />  \\"Heaven's Gate\\" is the labor of love of Michael Cimino.  Fresh from his award winning efforts on \\"The Deer Hunter\\", Cimino looked to bring to life the events surrounding the little known but fascinating Johnson County Wyoming range war in 1890-91.  Many of the circumstances that sparked the range war in the late 19th century were relevant in the late 20th century (and more so today); the friction between residents and the ever increasing flow of immigrants, concentration of wealth among a small powerful group of elite ranchers, their efforts to squeeze out small ranch operations and independent immigrant families, and the conflict felt by those in the middle who had ties to both sides.<br /><br />  Kris Kristofferson plays Jim Averill, a man who came from a wealthy east coast family, went to Harvard, and was expected to do great things.  Upon hearing the message of the good doctor (Joseph Cotten) at his graduation ceremony, telling his class that they should go out and enrich society with their wealth and prestige, Averill decides to go out west and make his mark among the citizens of the rough frontier.  Upon arriving in Wyoming, Averill joins the Cattlemen's Association as does his fraternity brother from Harvard,Billy Irvine (John Hurt).  Once he becomes a member of this august group, Averill discovers it is nothing more than a gathering of rich elitists from the east bent on cornering the beef market in the west and stamping out those who stand in their way.  Frustrated with their attitudes, he leaves acrimoniously while Billy continues upon the course he began in college, drinking himself irrelevant.<br /><br />  Averill decides to use what influence he has for good purposes and becomes the sherriff of Johnson County, keeping peace in a land becoming filled with newcomers and the residents who resent their intrusion.  While in office he becomes involved with the town madam Ella(Isabelle Huppert) who happens to count the Cattlemen's enforcer, Nate Champion (Christopher Walken) among her clients.  Averill understands Champion's position and the two are friendly until the Association takes the drastic step of branding the immigrants \\"anarchists\\" and declaring war on them for cattle theivery.  Averill has tried to hold the line and keep the Association from flexing their considerable muscle in his county, but this move unleashes the force of the Association (physical and political) culminating in a pitched battle between the two sides.  Averill leads the immigrants in a spirited defense against the Association and their army of hired guns.  In the end, this \\"rich man's army\\" is saved from defeat by the U.S. Army and the immigrants are left to bury their dead and wonder what happens next.<br /><br />  After witnessing the carnage, Averill and Ella pack their belongings to start anew further west when they are ambushed by members of the Association, angry at their efforts to organize the immigrants against them.  Ella is killed and Averill realizes the futility of fighting the system when he has nothing left to fight for.  He returns to the east, marries the girl he was meant to end up with, and spends his twilight years (symbolically) drifting on a yacht in Newport harbor Rhode Island wondering what might have been and trying to live with what he has experienced.<br /><br />  While there are some uneven patches in the film, it is an engrossing story that is wonderfully shot.  The cinematography is excellent and the locations are stunning.  The soundtrack is a great mix of European, early American, and folk that evokes the time and melting pot feel of the area.  (the cd is out of print, but worth tracking down.  It is available used through Amazon.)  I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys sweeping, epic pictures and also to anyone who has an interest in this period of American history.  The themes in this film resonate to this day; should wealth be horded by a privileged few? what are the consequences of the influence wealthy, powerful men hold over our elected officials?  who will stand up for those who are less fortunate in our society?  does power, money and influence equal right?  Finally, in addition to the actors I have mentioned, this film also stars Sam Waterston, Jeff Bridges, and Mickey Rourke (in a bit part). To those who are interested enough to want to read the true story about the Johnson County War, I recommend the \\"Powder River War\\" by Helena Huntington Smith.able used through Amazon.)

B000BM6AVA|3.0|If you thought Daron sang too much before, wait until you hear this album.  :(
B000BM6AVA|5.0|Let me just start out by saying that I own every SOAD album that they have put out, and I am very impressed by this album. Each song has a lot of meaning behind it. Daron's voice is a little strange, but I like it. I think he adds to the album, and he is the one who writes the lyrics, so he should be allowed to sing.  <br /> <br />Attack - 5/5 - Very good song, lyrics have good meaning, nice  melody. <br /> <br />Dreaming - 4.5/5 - Great vocals by Serj, good lyrics again. <br /> <br />Kill Rock N' Roll - 4.5/5 - lyrics are a little strange, and Daron sings much more in this one. <br /> <br />Hypnotize - 5/5 - Good choice for their single. Intro is amazing, and the song is just good. <br /> <br />Stealing Society - 4.5/5 - Fast paced song, I like when it goes into a surfer drum beat with Daron singing. <br /> <br />Tentative - 5/5 - Another great intro into the song. I think this takes us back to classic System, with a really heavy intro and mellower chorus. Good lyrics again. <br /> <br />U-Fig - 5/5 - Again, fast, heavy intro and it doesn't get slower until the middle part of the song. Shows off Serj's amazing voice. <br /> <br />Holy Mountians - 5/5 - One of my favorite songs one this album. Serj's voice is showcased here again, and the the screaming part is just amazing. I thought Daron's voice sounded demonic  <br />during the screaming. <br /> <br />Vicinity Of Obscenity - 4/5 - Lyrics are crazy... pretty much classic System of a Down here. Serj can do some weird things with his voice. It starts out with a yelling, then goes into a part that can sort of be described as a 70's beat. Its just a crazy song. <br /> <br />She's Like Heroin - 4.5/5 - Daron sings more here. His voice is strange, but I really like it. Not many people could do what he does with his voice. I think this song has some deep meaning about a girl and herion.  <br /> <br />Lonley Day - 5/5 - I love the slow melody here. Very powerful song. Daron sings again, and I think he does a great job here.  <br /> <br />Soldier Side - 5/5 - Leads into the Intro of the other CD. Tells the story of a soldier who is lost in battle. Amazing. The violin in the background for the intro is powerful. The entire song is powerful and moving. The best song on the CD for me.  <br /> <br />Overall 5/5. I loved this entire CD. I don't know how they will top the Mezmerize/Hypnotize duo album, but I know they will somehow. You need to listen to these two albums together, it will be more complete that way. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JLEX|5.0|Finally the first and second season of Seinfeld is available. See for yourself how the greatest sitcom ever started. The show is just geniuse and see for your self witht he halarious episodes. The charactors are all great Jerry, Elain, George and Kramer. The first and second season are not the best of the series but there still classic episodes that can be watched again and again.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|You have to listen to the CD a few times to get a feel for it.  After that, you are hooked and you'll love the beat of the music and the techno feel of the music.  I wish Madonna would have left the song \\"Isaac\\" off the CD.  That is the only bad song on the CD, so I had to give her 4 stars.  Otherwise, she would have had the 5.  It's great to hear music that sounds different from all the other junk out there.  Kudos to Madonna!

B000002H92|5.0|Disc One contains what used to be the double live album \\"Absolutely Live\\", which is just about the most electrifying life performance you'll ever hear by anyone.  So for the price they're charging, you're really getting Disc Two (with \\"Light My Fire\\", \\"Gloria\\", great live versions of songs from \\"Morrison Hotel\\" and lots of other great stuff) for free.  If you don't know The Doors, this is a great introduction.  If you do know The Doors, you'll definitely want to get this for the virtuosity of Robbie Krieger on lead guitar and Ray Manzarek on everything.  The drumming is powerful, unique, jazz-based, and allows everyone to do their thing without getting completely lost.  Of course, you already know Mr. Morrison. . .
B00005JO1J|5.0|Most recent movie remakes either were horrible (Dukes of Hazzard) or indescribably horrible (Bewitched). People responsible for those adaptations were so blinded by a chance of their picture making money that they consequently forgot to craft a product which actually WOULD make money.<br /><br />Fortunately, Christopher Columbus remembered when adapting Jonathan Larsen's 1996 hit musical RENT. Chronicling `a year in the life' of New York bohemians, RENT has previously been described as my generation's HAIR.<br /><br />This musical-film also deals with angst, love, tragedy, paired with lots of sociopolitical commentary. A group of artists' wrestles with AIDS, activism, personal addictions, and the politics of a former friend/roommate who wants to gentrify the area after he wed the landlord's daughter. He is now the elitist which he had once railed against---and the others are still fighting.<br /><br />I was ecstatic when I found out that my favorite musical was being adapted by the movies; then grew skeptical about the potential product's quality. I am elated to confirm that RENT is not among the `motion picture adaptation' causalities. It should become a `textbook example' of how GREAT movie adaptations are made.<br /><br />Most of the original (as in THE ORIGIAL) Broadway cast reprised roles for the movie. Because these actors had already invested so much time into the parts, they naturally wanted to do a good job on screen. I never got the impression they were calling in the lines, and therefore was genuinely sad when the movie ended----only because the picture was now over. I hadn't gotten that involved into a movie since I was a little kid.<br /><br />I particularly liked Anthony Rapp (Mark)'s acting and think that the character whom I act the most like is Maureen (Idina Menzel), the angry young activist lover of Joanne Jefferson (Tracie Thoms).<br /><br />I (of course!) knew ALL of RENT's musical numbers by heart before going into the movie theater, but finally seeing it on-screen and generally unaltered was a delightful experience. Absence of the `message machine' breaks in this movie genuinely did not bother me. This screenplay did not attempt to add anything into the characters as `compensation' for theater modifications and therefore prevented its own candle from going out.<br /><br />In another plus, it eschewed recent \\"sitcom-Disneyfied\\" portrayals of New York City to instead pointedly acknowledge cities as places where people are deal with life and death issues.heater, but finally seeing it on-screen and generally unaltered was a delightful experience.

B00000253N|5.0|This is the one where he bares his soul, reaches for eternity, attains it.
0156012197|5.0|The book is obviously a staple in children's literature, so what more can be said other than, if you haven't read it, do so immediately.  I keep a few extra copies which I can give away to both children (at a reading level for chapter books) and adults I think are special.  But the old translation (with white cover) is much better.
B0009S3HI0|4.0|B-sides albums are always sort of touchy subject. Either they can be beyond awesome collections of all the tracks you have lying around in random mp3's or on some mix tape your friend made you years ago. That, or they're kinda like the deftones b-side album is.  <br />By all means, don't get me wrong, I love this album, and I've been listening to it multiple times a day since I bought it. However there's things i would totally change if I would have released it. When I first checked out the track list I thought \\"Awesome! crenshaw punch, the chauffer, no ordinary love!\\" then I thought to myself, \\"wait, why are there 3 alt versions of white pony songs and the be quiet and drive acoustic version?\\" i think that the alt versions of those songs are awesome, but I don't think they really belong on a b-sides collection. The disc space those songs took up would have gone perfect for some amazing songs that are nowhere to be found on here. Namely \\"Teething\\" (found on the Crow: City of Angels soundtrack.), \\"Can't even breathe\\" (one of my absolute favorite deftones tracks, on the escape from L.A. soundtrack.), \\"Lovers\\", \\"To Have and to Hold\\" (on the Depeche Mode tribute \\"music for the masses\\".) and \\"The Boys Republic\\" (which would have been perfect for those fans who missed out on getting the limited edition of white pony.) <br />It would have also been cool to put some songs from the deftones archives, like old demo tracks redone/re-mixed or something. I've got a disc of old deftones tracks pre-adrenaline and some are chock-full of promise. It would have been cool to hear them nowadays in sort of an overview of their career and evolution of the sound. Granted that's more just a fanboy wish as opposed to anything that makes or breaks the album. <br />However, despite what ISN'T here, what IS here is awesome material. It kind of leans more twoards the mellower side of the deftones, and away from the more full-throttle Sacto-thrash that defined them on the first two albums. If you didn't know better, you could almost think it was a Team Sleep b-sides album at points. Especially covering Duran Duran, Cocteau Twins, the Cure, Sade, and the Smiths. All of those songs however are amazing, catchy, and the band comes together marvelously. \\"Wax and Wane\\", and \\"No Ordinary Love\\" definitly being the best two of the group. \\"Please Please Please let me get what i want\\" I think totally puts the Smiths version to shame. <br />However the disc isn't totally devoid of heavier moments. The tone's doing a cover of Helmet's \\"Sinatra\\" is just as heavy and grooving as the original. It's very much in deftones style, and Chino's vocals lay over it awesomely. Also their cover of Skynard's \\"Simple Man\\" is epic feeling and catchy, but at the end it does feel a bit repetitive. My only gripe would have to come from \\"Black Moon\\" which is a deftones/B-Real joint. I normally love B-real and Cypress-Hill, but this song just seems really weak. It's very fitting as a B-side, but doesn't fit in well here. Maybe if they added in \\"Teething\\" and \\"Can't Even Breathe\\" it would fit a little better. There's very little that goes on in the track, and Chino's presence is limited. It's almost like a Cypress track with Chino adding a couple vocal scratches here and there. <br />The DVD part however is were it's at. Normally I sort of discredit DVD's packaged in with albums, but this one is where the bread and butter is. Pretty much every deftones music video, mixed with candid footage, live video, and a bit of interview stuff too. Everything is mixed seemlessly together and is the perfect career overview that you'd be looking for. From Adrenaline onwards, it shows the shape and the change of the band's sound perfectly. The DVD definitly makes up for any shortcomings in the CD portion. The packaging is also awesome. It's very much like a hardback book, with a full color booklet bound into it. It's got loads of pictures, and notes on each of the CD tracks from the guys in the band (mostly Stef and Abe). <br />I wouldn't reccomend this to the casual \\"Deftones? Yeah, they're pretty cool.\\" type of fan. Unless they only like white pony onwards. This package is a must have for the hardcore deftones fan though. If not because it's got great tracks on it, but to have all those random tracks you have spread all over the places in one disc. All in all, it's a great hold over till the next studio album, despite a couple omissions that keep it from perfection.
B0004Z33G4|5.0|and they mean Ultimate when they say so.     I had recently learned of the redicuolous marketing for these movies, and that's the typical DVD company for you. But because of the bad reviews, is only the die hard fan's problems, not yours. This is only because die hard fans had obviously bought the first box set released, then companys decided to make another for the sake of better special features, and other suspicious reasons. This gave fans who had the older set the urge to buy the next one, and probably sell off the other. But this is when the companys have the chance to release one more on the fans and new comers alike. This enables them to make money off of people buying and rebuying these DVD sets, and it works. Their loyalty isn't to you, THEY'RE A BUSINESS, they are there to get paid like everyone else wants to.       What my real point is however, is that this is a no problemo situation for ones that have not wasted their time with the older sets at their release dates. The other sets are good, and have their pros and cons. But to me, the Ultimate edition packs the least amount of cons, and is for a fact, THEE Ultimate collection. Why? Here is why I think so.     Special Features:     Aspect Ratio: Letter box 2:35 (Perfect widescreen)   Special commentary by Sylvester Stallone on First Blood only, other Rambo sequels have commentaries by the Directors (YES!)   First Blood, Rambo III, Deleted scenes (Very good)   First Blood, features alternate suicide ending (What a find!)    And a Meta vision: So called to expand your viewing capability of the films (Interesting)     And more!      Overall: I love the final Rambo collection. I shall continue to be entertained and blown away by these films, as they will remain a remarkable franchise.     (Thank you, to Sylvester Stallone)     and remember fans, Rambo 4 is coming this year 2006
B00005QAPH|1.0|Without a doubt, the most pretentious, self-indulgent mess of a movie I've ever seen.  The high praise showered on this film baffles me.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|Kung Fu Hustle is the best martial arts film of the year. I agree, this is Kill Bill meets Looney Tunes. Stephen Chow wrote and directed this film and I have to say that this is awesome! He is sure to be the next big martial arts star of Hollywood. The script is your typical Kung Fu story, but the fight scenes are excellent and I can't say enough and the fantastic special effects. The Lion Scream, The Buddhist Palm, I could just go on and on, this film is amazing.<br /><br />My personal favorite scene of the movie is when the kung fu masters fight the two assassins that play their instruments while tossing swords at their opponents. I have never seen anything like that in my life on a movie; the best part! Worth seeing the movie just for that battle sequence alone! If you love martial arts/kung fu movies this is for you!!!!
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|In short: eerie, crunchy and utterly satisfying, with an extra dollop of sexiness.  <br /> <br />Lullabies is its own entity: not as hyperactive as Songs for the Deaf, trippy as Rated R (but almost!) or as raw as the self-titled album but it also sort of summarizes everything Queens has done so far. You've got your ultra-catchy edgy pop tinged songs a la Go With the Flow and First it Giveth (Little Sister, In My Head), the characterisitic rampant raging guitars (Medication, Everyone Knows That You Are Insane) and strange psychedelia reminiscent of Rated R's Better Living Through Chemistry (Someone's in the Wolf, This Blood is Love). It also features Queens most beautiful songs: I Never Came and The Long Slow Goodbye.  <br /> <br /> Also, this album is such a grower. Don't write it off because it isn't a repeat of the constant balls to the wall rock-out Songs for the Deaf. When I first listened to this I wasn't sure what to think because all the songs seemed to blur together. It wasn't until a few spins later that the individual power of the songs really came through and the album got into my blood for good. The first half of the album is the most accessible but I actually love the second half more.  Give it a few listens and let Lullabies get under your skin. The musical equivalent of the darkest, creamiest chocolate- but with a bite.

And then scream again. What is wrong with the world today. <br /> <br />Buy Images & Words. Then buy everything else Dream Theater has ever made. Then organize a protest in your hometown against MTV and all current pop music (focusing on Hilary Duff and Lindsay Lohan). Please.
B000AMWIVM|4.0|Finally got to see this movie and this is a very good DVD. <br /> <br />Saw has a great premise and spooky villian, that kept me watching all the way. <br /> <br />It has flaws for sure, the acting is strained but its backed up by a few bigger actors on board. <br /> <br />Where it delivers is in the spooky atmosphere and shocks and the ending which I thought was really interesting but <br />I'm not too sure I understand it - ah well it was different and thats all you can ask for a movie. <br /> <br />Now must go see saw 2! <br /> <br />check it out.
076790592X|5.0|If this book were not based on a true story, it would probably get negative reviews for being too far-fetched and unlikely. However, it is based on a true story, and for that, it is revered as one of the most inspiring books on the market today. Mitch Albom was blessed to have known someone like Morrie, who was that comfortable with his own death, that he used much of his last time on earth reflecting on life and trying to make it work out better for the ones he loved. Most people can think of someone that they know that is impossible not to love, and to Mitch Albom, this person is Morrie Schwartz, and this book is the story of how Morrie passes on lessons of life before he succumbs to Lou Gehrig disease. Also recommended is the movie, with a great job by Jack Lemmon as Morrie.
B00003XACV|5.0|American Beauty - a great movie with an equally great score.  Directed by Sam Mendes, who went on to equally great heights with \\"Road to Perdition\\", it is mainly a comedy-drama, though begins to focus more on drama later on.  Newman's score perfectly suits the surroundings.  It was largely an experimental score, compared to the style of his previous works before this film.  However, he delivered quite well and the soundtrack added immensely to the film.  This is probably what influenced Sam Mendes to use music so respectfully in \\"Road to Perdition\\" - who knows what he would have done had he hired another composer for American Beauty, and recieved a score of lesser brilliance. <br /> <br />American Beauty is characterized by three main motifs.  First is the excited vibes and marimbas, second is the gentle piano wanderings, and third is the bearing string pads.  The vibe sound is used often throughout the score.  It is used to full effect to open the score, then continues to create a dreamlike trance in \\"Arose\\" and an upbeat atmosphere in \\"Lunch with the King\\".  \\"Bloodless Freak\\" is repetitive - and that is most likely intentional, to represent the repitition of the character's actions on screen.  The first piano theme is introduced in \\"Mental Boy\\", admist weird noises which leave abruptly to let it sink in. <br /> <br />If there is one thing that is remarkable about this score, it's that Newman uses themes to denote atmosphere and idea, rather than something blunt, like to denote a character.  For instance, the theme in \\"Mental Boy\\" is first used to describe the character Ricky filming the family from their window.  Later, it is used when Lester is nearing his fantasy about his daughter's best friend.  The connection between the two isn't obvious, but it is present, as something, to put it bluntly \\"weird\\".  Slightly surreal, \\"wrong\\" in many ways, dark.  In a more positive tone, the theme from \\"American Beauty\\", rather than representing a scene or character, it represents beauty itself, and is played at two moments where we catch glimpses of beauty as explained through the characters. <br /> <br />The downside to this score is that some may find it gets repetitive on a constant listen.  Many of the motifs are repeated almost exactly as they were previously, and not developed much as one would expect in other scores.  For instance, the theme from \\"American Beauty\\" repeats in \\"Any Other Name\\" in an almost identical way, although with slightly varying string patterns and an extra piano motif near the end.  Similarly, \\"Dead Already\\" and \\"Still Dead\\" do not differ greatly in their presentation. <br /> <br />Thomas Newman has established himself as a diverse and original composer with a unique tone in his music.  What astounds me is that he is great with minimalistic instrumentation and odd sounds, but can also strike a chord easily when it comes to emotional, heartfelt music.  If you liked American Beauty, I reccomend you check out \\"Road to Perdition\\" for more Tom Newman magic.
0156027321|5.0|This book will fulfill whatever it is you are looking for in a good reading. Whether you're looking for fiction, philosophy, religion, a parent reading to a child, or a great book for discussion, Life of Pi easily fulfills those categories. In a brilliant work of literature, Yann Martel tells the story of Pi and his journey across the Pacific Ocean on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger. The story keeps you intrigued by telling of Pi's life growing up around a zoo, his three relgions, and his quest to stay alive, overcoming adversity on the Pacific. The reader finds out in the first pages (or on the back cover) that Pi does indeed survive the journey, but this book is about more than his survival story. The final pages of this book are guaranteed to make you spend a lot of time in thought, reflecting on what you have just read. Did you just read about a boy's struggle to stay alive with a tiger on a lifeboat, or did you just read a completely different story? That is the question that you will ask yourself when this book is finished. This book is recommended to any casual reader, because as stated in my opening sentence, at least one aspect of it will compel you, no matter what you are looking for in a book.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|OK, I am no expert on the horror genre. And I really haven't watched any of the \\"blah blah of the Dead\\" movies. Still, this is fun. Real fun. Did you see 28 Days Later? Imagine you could laugh at it. This is what \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" is like. Apart from some boring mish-mash scenes in the bar, the movie is great fun to watch. Much advised.
0201633612|5.0|Over ten years ago I found myself at a seminar given by Ralph Johnson. My employers were keen to send us on a course and I had literally picked one at random out of a magazine because the title sounded good (same title as book).    I found the seminar confusing and stuggled to grasp what Ralph was talking about. What did he mean by a singleton? As an 80's computer science graduate I had had very little real teaching of OO other than what I had learned off my own back and I thought I understood it well enough. Because of this I quickly wrote off what Ralph was describing as 'academic nonsense' and even said this to my workmates who were as out of their depth as I was.    But..I was the only one of us who went along to the seminar that actually bothered to read the book. In hindsight I can see this as _the_ major turning point in my career as a programmer and developer of software. This book is for everyone who is interested in OO design but for some developers this book will be like a 1000 watt lightbulb switching on inside your head.
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|If you are like me, and want to hear the explanations (logical explanations, that is) and the background story of a movie, legend etc. then Batman Begins is a dream come true. Except for the love affair side story (which leaves an unfinished, rusty taste in your mouth) this is one hell of a super hero story. I can only compare it to the opening movie \\"Batman\\" (I still think that Michael Keaton is the best Batman ever). Well done!
B0002JJBZY|5.0|The Star Trek Collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series DVD Collections (The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise). At around 1400 minutes per box, you are looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing. That is 1 month of non-stop Star Trek. No DVD series comes remotely close to that. The TOS series ends with series III. The total number of TOS episodes from season I to season III is 80. Running time for TOS is approx 60 hours. Get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years. By the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years. It is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also. Our very planet, Earth, has advanced because of Gene Roddenberry's admirable concept. Roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too. `The Bridge' members are like our family. Watch what they do. Then go and spend your life striving for the same on Earth. What engineer, medic, scientist, teacher, worker can not say that Star Trek has not influenced them? The show is this significant in the development of our species. Even Christians respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why. The DVD case is beautiful. Make sure to retain the cardboard holder that it sits into as this helps stability on the shelf (although the box can still stand alone the bottom is a little narrow). The shell cracks open down the centre to reveal a box. Sliding out of the box is a small booklet insert with discs in a well designed plastic holder that flip from disc to disc. There are 4 episodes per disc, and 8 discs in total. However the last disc, disc 8, only has two episodes, for a grand total of 30 episodes. The rest of disc 8 is devoted to Star Trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras...and then some more. Several of the shows come with a commentary. All the episodes have been remastered to the point that scratches and artefacts are hardly visible. The special effects have been touched up slightly (no strings), however they still retain an overall early look and feel, especially the initial episodes that have budget restrictions. The episodes are ordered not in the sequence they where filmed, but in the sequence that they aired, however each episode has been numbered according to the order they where filmed in. This means on one disc you have shows 4, 2, 12 and 1, in that order. The sound has also been remastered to 5:1 Dolby Digital! Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.<br /><br />Star Trek, The Original Series (TOS), Season One, is a fine example of the growing stages of any television series. Viewing the episodes in the order they where filmed shows the vision shaping. Spock is the only character to be retained from the pilot episode `The Cage'. Kirk appears after this one. Chekov does not appear until Season Two. Yeoman Smith appears in quite a number of Season One episodes before retiring from the show. The little known Nurse Chapel also appears here as well as the other series. The Enterprise itself is a mere hunk of plastic that does not improve much until Season Two and is funny to see. There are very little space shots in Season One because of the limitations of visual effects. The main viewer of The Bridge looks like a projector screen and is avoided much of the time. When something does appear there it looks completely phoney... and funny. Spock's makeup design goes through a few changes. However, even though we can laugh at much of Season One now, the series does gel and soon we have some fascinating sci-fi theory and execution, even though what we are watching is the equivalent of a stage play. Nobody can critic the quality of the television acting and notsince Flash Gordon had the world seen anything like it before. The stories (mostly by DC Fontana) are slightly narrow in their field of vision, however these where to mature in later seasons. Season One of TOS is mostly about alien illusions, shape shifters, psi-power, viruses, alternative universes, intergalactic slavery, military trials, deities, time travel and close hand to hand combat with aliens. There is also the unforgettable award winning `The City on the Edge of Forever' starring Joan Collins. `Operation: Annihilate!' has the flying face huggers type creatures that the movie `Alien' ripped off. Kahn appears in this series. We have both Klingons and Romulans also. The classic `Devil in the Dark' sees Kirk and Spock fight an underground cave monster. Kirk goes hand to hand with a giant reptile in the episode `Arena'. Surprisingly enough very few episodes actually contain all the characters at one time, including Sulu and Scotty. This does not happen until Season Two and then occurs often in Season Three. In TOS Season One characters are sort of alternated from episode to episode. The bottom line for TOS: Season One is that it is a classic. Although it is not necessarily the best of the Seasons, it works well as a very good foundational study for Trekkies who will absolutely adore seeing the variations in design and theme. All in all this is the funny season for 21st century viewers. You are supposed to laugh at this one more than thinking about its topics. And what a laugh it is! Just watch Kirk roll about the desert scrub with a seven foot man in a rubber reptile costume. How can you not want that!<br /><br />Star Trek, The Original Series (TOS), Season Two, starts to get a budget based on the ratings of TOS Season One. The Enterprise has undergone a new design and looks more than just a hunk of plastic hanging from a string... although not by much. The Bridge looks bigger with more components and consoles. Chekov, who was not in Season One, makes his first appearance here. Season Two has more space shots and attempts are made to film the Enterprise making manoeuvres. Costumes are brushed up a bit, but Kirk's new green sweater might attract some debate. The intro credits have an irritating *ding* sound every few seconds. Both the Green sweater and the *ding* are done away with in Season Three. Apart from a few questionable episodes the series does takeoff in the right direction. There is an instalment with the character Dr. Zefram Cochrane who appears in the movie First Contact. There are themes of rapid aging, furry pets, alien abduction, telepathy, Nazis, advanced computers and time travel. Scotty appears more often than usual. We are introduced into our first space station that looks like pre-deep space nine. The alien costumes are given a sprucing up. In one episode there is a gathering of about twelve various life forms. The big plus side is in the quality of the dialogue between the characters. Spock and Bones go at one another more often. There is tension on deck as well as post-mayhem humour and analysis. At the end of each episode Kirk usually makes a statement to round up the day's affairs. They even crack a joke or two. It is worth it for the episodes \\"Trouble with Tribbles\\" and \\"Patterns of Force\\", along with being an important instalment for any collector's series. The main thing you will like about Season Two is the improved interaction between the characters. The camera also pans and dollies more, with lots of handheld making the visuals less static than in Season One. The credits and end credits also undergo a revamp, including titles that appear as the episode starts and ends and not just along with the music. There is lots of experimentation and improvement here that has since stood the test of time. The budget boost was certainly worth it.<br /><br />Star Trek, The Original Series (TOS), Season Three, continues to improve on visual effects and camera work, based on the big budget of Season Two's success. Although the bridge and the Enterprise model have not undergone much of a revamp since Season II the characters are beefed up and the acting is more refined. Kirk looses his green sweater that attracted some debate in Season Two. The credits are now in blue and the music no longer has the irritating *ding* sound every few seconds. There are themes of body organ theft, genetic manipulation, memory loss, alien possession, insanity, time travel, apocalypses, dimensions, psychic powers, empathy, love potions, discrimination, alien abduction, over population, immortality and the sixties. Scotty undergoes several different hairdos. This series is also the one where Kirk kisses Uhura, in \\"Plato's Stepchildren\\", the first interracial kiss on American television. In fact Kirk goes on to kiss all the women in Season Three! It is worth it for the episodes \\"The Cloud Minders\\", \\"The Tholian Web\\", \\"Spectre of the Gun\\", \\"Let That Be Your Last Battlefield\\" along with being an important instalment for any collector's series. The final disc contains the pilot episodes \\"The Cage\\" in two different versions. The `original version' is in fact a copy of a black and white broadcast even though it was shot in color. The color edition can be found in the \\"restored version\\". Anyway both pilot versions are here in Season III. \\"The Cage\\" was eventually remade into an episode and aired. This aired version can be found in TOS Season One. The main thing you will like about Season Three is how it genuinely makes attempts to expand on science-fiction concepts. Additionally there are quite a few story twists that will surprise. At the same time this was to be the final season for TOS, cancelled in the middle of the height of the 60s (summer of 1969) due to low ratings. It is sad when you come to the end of Series III knowing that you have spent the last few months enjoying being beside Kirk, Spock, Bones and Scotty but this did not stop Gene Roddenberry from pitching the idea to turn Star Trek into motion picture films. Thanks to that we have these box office successes to keep us going. Now boldly onto Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) Series I!!!!!!!irst appearance here. Season Two has more space shots and attempts are made to film the Enterprise making manoeuvres. Costumes are brushed up a bit, but Kirk's new green sweater might attract some debate.

It is worth it for the episodes \\"The Cloud Minders\\", \\"The Tholian Web\\", \\"Spectre of the Gun\\", \\"Let That Be Your Last Battlefield\\" along with being an important instalment for any collector's series. The final disc contains the pilot episodes \\"The Cage\\" in two different versions. The `original version' is in fact a copy of a black and white broadcast even though it was shot in color. The color edition can be found in the \\"restored version\\". Anyway both pilot versions are here in Season III. \\"The Cage\\" was eventually remade into an episode and aired. This aired version can be found in TOS Season One. The main thing you will like about Season Three is how it genuinely makes attempts to expand on science-fiction concepts. Additionally there are quite a few story twists that will surprise. At the same time this was to be the final season for TOS, cancelled in the middle of the height of the 60s (summer of 1969) due to low ratings. It is sad when you come to the end of Series III knowing that you have spent the last few months enjoying being beside Kirk, Spock, Bones and Scotty but this did not stop Gene Roddenberry from pitching the idea to turn StarTrek into motion picture films. Thanks to that we have these box office successes to keep us going. Now boldly onto Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) Series I!!!!!!!
B000BM6AVA|4.0|serj is great. daron sucks. if he shut up this album would be much better. i was disappointed with mesmerize because daron seemed to be the featured vocalist. regardless HYPNOTIZE,while not quite as edgy as their earlier musical offerings(SOAD & TOXICITY), still sounds fresh at times and even occasionally surprising. overall a nice effort from this veteran band.
B00003CXAW|5.0|Finally out on DVD. Released by Warner Bros. not the cheap Korean versions. Not much to review, one of the top 5 movies ever produced. I would like to comment on Amazon.com's delivery. Was shipped on Nov 21 and delivered Nov 23. Amazon.com told us not to expect delivery until Dec. 2. With free shipping, we ordered another product, it made this a great deal.
B000002B35|5.0|I dont know why this album is getting such bad reviews,this album sounds way better than Delicate Sound Of Thunder,people say that the band sounds a little bit rusty??? c'mon! this is pink floyd in their 40's or 50's,the band pulls off some incredible numbers here,the addition of dick parry makes it even better,guy pratt manage to get a decent voice for Run Like Hell you even get to forget about roger for awhile,+ the solo in Comfortably numb its excellent,all the tracks in here sound excellent,david dint try to sing out of line or try any other trick with his vocal lines,Learning to fly sounds so much much much better live than it does in DSOT,One of these days,Astronomy domine,Hey you,etc.. all tracks are excellent,i cant see no down flaws with the album,maybe that bluesy part in Money,but its ok,it does not ruin the DSOTM live performance.In review This album its the best live set since \\"Is there anybody out there? 1980-81\\" period!.
0553801503|3.0|For the most part this book ia a major bore compared to the last three. It took me what seemed like forever to get through it :( <br />One can only hope that he improves in the next installment.
0684852756|4.0|I spend a lot of time searching out books just like this one; short, vibrant, challenging and with beautiful language.  Intimacy is a compelling book that is startling in its bold use of language and the stark honesty of the main character, a man on the brink of leaving his wife and two kids in pursuit of sex with a woman he had an affair with, who may, or may not, take him back.    As other reviewers have mentioned, the narrator, Jay, is completely unlikeable.  Despite being middle-aged he acts like a selfish and self-pitying child.  Jay complains and whines about everything and has led a life of self-indulgent excesses.  He disliked his children when they were younger and admits to having pushed one roughly when it was a baby so that it hit his head.  He also keeps drugs in the fridge and has had endless affairs while married.  His wife, Susan, is also quite unlikeable, as are the majority of his friends.  What redeems the book is its short, snappy style.  I would not have wanted to read a thick, deeply involving book about these characters, but a short novel was just right.       I thought the book was a perfect portrayal of the particular type of modern person that believes in nothing, and therefore has nothing to believe in!  Without belief in anything such as lasting love, himself, God or something other than pleasure and sex, Jay is on the pathway of destruction.  Jay is actually a coward, as instead of telling his wife face to face that he is going to leave her and their children, he sneaks out of the house while she is at work and leaves a note on the table explaining all.  In contrast to some of the other reviews, I do not think that this is a book that sums up the whole of the male species.  Jay is a disturbed guy - hence the cocaine and the ecstasy and the mindless f*cking and goodness knows what else!  There is more to life than that.        Read this book if you like short, thought-provoking fiction that dwells on the seedier aspects of the male psyche.  Skip this one if you want to read about likeable characters.    JoAnne
B00003CXAW|5.0|It's really very simple. The incredible reacreation of the \\"Lost Spider Pit Sequence\\" on the extras DVD is reason alone for buying this set. Peter Jackson's crew in New Zealand took weeks out of their updated King Kong shoot, to recreate the infamous lost sequence using the same stop-motion techniques as the original. Sailors scream in horror as they vainly attempt to save themselves from the gaping, dripping jaws of all manner of nightmarish beasties. What fun! And the whole sequence, which truly has the authentic aura of what the scene might have looked like, is rendered in glorious old-fashioned, 1930's black and white. They've even added a triceratops to help encourage the sailors onto the log bridge in the first place (based on a production still), when I saw this, I had to go back to the first disc and check out that scene thinking that I had forgotten the triceratops was there. Incredible, and the mini-documentary about how they created this \\"lost\\" sequence... fascinating. Now, if only someone could stumble on the actual lost sequence in their attic...
0425188809|5.0|This was the first book I read by Dean R. Koontz. I was totally mesmerized by it - great mystery - thrilling story. Not like the movie infact I was looking forward to the movie and I was disappointed that they did not follow the book.  This is a great book!
B0002OERI0|1.0|Let me start off saying that I kinda liked Green Day with Dookie, but I've never been a huge fan.  This album, however, is quite possibly the worst album to come out in a long time. <br />It's pointless, lame, and lacks any trace of musical talent.  The whole premise and influence of the album will become obsolete before you know it.  It seems to focus on current politics the whole time and it'll be hard to relate to that in 4 or 5 years. <br /> <br />Apart from it's premise, the music in generall is absolutely sickening.  I must say that I have not so passionately hated a song as much as Boulevard of Broken Dreams in the history of my life.  Hearing the 12 year old girl style of vocals sing the pointless and meaningless chorous of this song makes me want to vomit.  If this song comes on the radio I immediately change the station.  I think this is the only song that makes me do this.  Wake Me Up When September Ends is another song that is simply stomach churning.  Top these off with songs such as American Idiot, St. Jimmy, and Letterbomb and you have one terrible album.  The band can be described best by the second word in the album title. <br /> <br />So there you have it, the album proclaimed by many as the best of 2004.  I'm not sure if i'm listening to the same album.  The music has no resemblence to that of Pink Floyd or The Beatles as some will tell you.  I can't believe someone would even be dumb enough to even compare this band with the likes of Pink Floyd or the Fab Four.  This also begs the question, is this where the rock genre, or for that matter, music in generall is going?  I mean it's just terrible, I'd actually rather listen to just about any form of hip-hop than this album.  So, is Green Day truly doing what I thought impossible?  That is, of course, make the hip-hop genre better than the rock genre.  That's actually quite a feat in a really sad, shameful sort of way.   <br /> <br />Bands playing this sickening style of music are sprouting up everywhere such as Coheed and Cambria, The All American Rejects, and Death Cab for Cutie.  I just ask the question, what ever happened to rockin'?  Why do we have to be emotionally touched and cry whenever we listen to music now?  Thank God there are still bands such as Shadows Fall and Black Label Society that still know how to rock. <br /> <br />All in all, a terrible album that really suprises me in how bad a collection of songs can really be.  Technically Green Day is to be congradulted for attaining a new level of suck. <br /> <br />
0671024256|5.0|I loved this book - devoured it like a fine meal - I needed it like I need air to breath!
B000A7DVRC|1.0|So shoot me!  In this day and age I would thin that if some DVD said \\"COLLECTOR'S EDITION\\" at the top it would have the various bells and whistles -- would have wide-screen and full-screen versions in the package. <br /> <br />Stupid me, when I saw the \\"COLLECTOR'S EDITION\\" I did not notice that it was a FULL-SCREEN-ONLY DVD package!   <br /> <br />OK, so I am cryiny the blues now, but why do they do this???? <br /> <br />No more Coen DVDs for me until I have sold this PoS DVD to somebody. <br /> <br />J
B000B8QEZG|5.0|People are calling this Madonna's \\"come back\\" album. Well, if you listen to \\"American Life\\" without hearing all the bad press behind it, you will realize that she never went away. But, I digress.....\\"Confessions On A Dance Floor\\" is a GREAT,GREAT,GREAT album. Not since the days of \\"Into the Groove\\" or, my personal favorite, \\"Causin' A Commotion\\" has Madonna made such fun, unadulterated dance-pop. \\"Hung Up\\" is such a great ride. I recently went out to a major dance club here in NYC where they played it THREE times that night, and no one could resist it each time. Every song is great on this album. My favorite is \\"Jump\\", which reminds me of her 80s days. Fantastic beat, fantastic melody, fantastic production. \\"I Love New York\\" is another song that makes you proud to be a New Yorker, or makes you WANT to be a New Yorker if you're not one. \\"How High\\", \\"Future Lovers\\", \\"Push\\" are all songs that will get you off your butt and moving. This album will win over new fans for Madonna and help her remain the ONE AND ONLY queen of pop music.
B0007GAERG|1.0|Mariah looks so pretty on the cover of \\"Imancipation..\\"..almost lifelike. I have downloaded this album several times for free for my Mariah friends so they don't have to throw their money in the trash. Like Janet..Mariah will always be the poor mans Madonna.
B000A88F22|1.0|So this is how far society has fallen, that this sort of sick voyeuristic garbage has made its way into the American mainstream as passable prime-time entertainment. Who sells the story of their \\"true love story\\" to millions of strangers? Britney & Kevin: Chaotic is our wake-up call. Get more intelligent shows on television, because this is insulting. <br /> <br />Randomly catching a rerun on the show for the first time on television, I was actually shocked into watching the entire series. I thought it couldn't get worse, but it could. It was all blatant propaganda from Hollywood. What a disgusting excuse for reality television. Britney's life probably does not revolve around making silly faces at herself in the mirror, but Chaotic makes it seem as though that that activity makes up 90% of her time. The thing is, it's simply boring as all hell. Even the \\"dramatic tension\\" is tiresome. <br /> <br />Please. Save yourself. Watching this is like having a root canal, only less fun.
0812975219|4.0|This pithy book discusses how we perceive and analyze events. Its primary advice is to never bet without considering the impact of what will happen if you are wrong. However there are no details on what to do specifically and no market advice other than that you can assume nothing about the future. You should always specify an event that will prove you wrong, watch for it, and be able to gracefully abandon a mistake. <br /> <br />The book is an essay on thinking by a a former quant options trader who is also a generalist that has read widely. It does contain, IMO, some assertions over which reasonable people may disagree (e.g., that Newtonian physics is wrong rather than that it is incomplete)but on the whole it is a  delightful book and well worth reading (so long as you are not lookiing for specific market advice).
1401308201|5.0|If you are a fan young or old of the Wizard of Oz you always have a feeling that the movie doesn't tell the whole story.  The Broadway Musical \\"Wicked\\" has been a runaway success because it fills in so many gaps in this timeless classic.  The Grimmerie is a beautiful reminder and keepsake that you can share with the family and friends when you want to relive the experience of seeing the show.  This book packs alot of information in a very small amount of space including but not limited too, how the show is produced, how sets are constructed, how the actors/actress's prepare for each night and the true joy that they take in preforming this Musical night after night.  You will come away from reading the Grimmerie wanting more and I highly recommend not only the original book \\"Wicked\\" on which this Musical is based, but also the Original Broadway Cast Recording.  It will leave you with the feeling that you are not just listening to the recording but truly experiencing a \\"Wicked\\" performance.
B00097DXZS|5.0|Besides all of the poor reviews I feel this album deserves the respect it intendanly shows. Santana is one of the most working hard musicians and he takes his sensability to a while different level with funk, r/b, jazz, blues, rock, you name it, santana is one of the most versitial musicians of the last century. He takes on different artist such as Bo Bice the american idol runner up, also the los lonley boys one of the most biggest acts out their, and then he goes to other styles such as rap including renditions with Mary J Blige, and Joss Stone. Their is also a wonderful track done with Steven Tyler. This album like I once wrote is prob. going to win a few grammy's because its creative, inspiring, and very talented. So I HIGHLY RECOMEND you purchase this right now, because this is All That I Am!!!Enjoy!!!!
B000B8QEYC|4.0|Firstly, I like Enya's music.  I enjoy the overlayering of the vocals and the synth instrumental work.  I've never been too impressed by the words themselves but there are a couple of songs on this album which have slightly more interesting lyrics.  If you've liked Enya's previous work, you'll like this album as well.  If you've been waiting for her to expand and try something new, this is not your day.  It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that Enya and the Ryans are sticking with the same method of making music - this album will easily be #1 for the week of its release and will be as or more successful than its predecessors.  My reaction to this album is the same as the last few, there are some songs I really enjoy and some I have probably listened to two or three times in passing over the last ten years.  Three that I felt stood out were: \\"Less than a pearl,\\" \\"Long, long journey,\\" and \\"Amid the falling snow.\\"
1878424319|5.0|This is a wonderful text. If you are intersted in re-discovering four habits for living a happier and fuller life, this is the book for you. Furthermore, you get them in the package of Native American wisdom and insight. Who can doubt the power and humanism in such a historically rich culture as that?  <br />The greatest element of this text is that it is simple to read and fast. You could read it in a couple of hours. You can read this text with the benefit of knowing that it isn't buried in pages of thoughtlessness. It is direct.  <br />The four elements are really great. They aren't earth-shattering. However, they are practical and obvious. Fact is, it takes a concise and clear book like this to remind us that life is capable of being more meaningful. We can be in control. <br />I can't imagine someone not being able to benefit from this text. It is self-help, spiritual, and motivational.
0312330529|5.0|I'm on Amazon purchasing copies of this book to give as gifts so that I can make my friends read it - I'm dying to talk to someone else who's experienced it.  It's not a book you READ - it's vivid, the writing is such that you FEEL it.   <br /> <br />I purchased this book shortly before Hurricane Wilma hit here in Florida.  We had no damage - but the power was out for a week.  I sat transfixed, reading this book, all week. <br /> <br />The writing is beautiful.  You want to read it aloud, highlight passages, go back just to read the way something is stated.  I lost a son in June very suddenly - he was only 14 - and parts of the book (by no means all of it) deal with loss of loved ones.  For the first time since my son died, I felt as if someone understood the pain I was feeling.  It was very healing for me - like salve on a burn. <br /> <br />I'd recommend this book to everyone!!
B000BGH22W|4.0|I had very high expectations for this film soundtrack.  I loved Patrick Doyle's work for Sense and Sensibility and others.  I like the Quidditch World Cup track and Foreign Visitors Arrive, but I found myself liking the Prisoner of Azkaban Soundtrack much more.  The good parts of The Goblet of Fire Soundtrack are very short and I wish there was more of a theme throughout.  I'm not sure it's worth the money, but parts of it are enjoyable.  The movie is good, go see it!
1878574590|5.0|I must admit I had never read this until after I saw the movie.  The film left me in awe and as soon as I left the theater I went straight to a book store and bought this book.  If you like comic books and are tired of the same old heroes, then this is the book for you.  The storytelling and characters are top notch, and while Marv is only human, his story is almost superhuman.  This was even better than the film, and inspired me to purchase the other volumes, and everyone is just as good as the first.  Although some may say the violence takes away from the story, I believe it gives you a better understanding of how volatile Sin City is.  Top Ratings!  Order this now!
B0006IIPIK|5.0|\\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" was Kerry Conran's one-man homage (the original six-minute short, included as an extra, was made on a Mac in his apartment, no less) to the sci-fi film serials of the 1930s and 40s, replete with snappy, sultry reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) in search of the ultimate scoop, cocky fighter pilot Joe Sullivan (Jude Law), the over-eager, clean-cut techno-whiz kid sidekick Dex (Giovanni Ribisi), and feisty, no-nonsense ex-flame Frankie (Angelina Jolie), commander of an airborne British squadron. I thought the actors did a wonderful job, especially when you consider that there were no sets, props, etc. to set the stage, so to speak.<br /><br />The film was completely created via CGI, and takes viewers from the Art Deco lines of New York to the gardens of Shangri-la on a quest to discover why giant robots are attacking cities around the globe. This is a film of unprecedented beauty, filled to the brim with every child's thrills: dinosaurs, robots, ray guns, dirigibles, rockets, airborne battles, and more, with a dash of romance and intrigue for the grownups. It's even more amazing watching the two-part documentary Brave New World, in which we see the soundstages and blue screens, completely devoid of props, etc. except for the actors and their marks. The costumes, music, and filmmaking lovingly recall the 1930s and 1940s, from the film titles to the sweeping orchestral themes. An experience not to be missed for fans of vintage sci-fi the gloriously cheesy sci-fi serials of decades past.
B000BC8STC|4.0|great vintage performance from the godfather , bit like a bootleg ? but ex sound and pic , negative on this , does NOT have the bonus trax has promised from pre -sale info , but for the price hard core JB fans you just gotta have it , its similar to the beat club show of the same year , but with a bigger audience , need to ask amazon why they promise bonus trax <br />when there aint non? but for the money buy it , funky .p
B0002EXH54|4.0|Its been almost 20 years since this came out.  I've lived with this album for thirteen of them, and in my opinion it still breaks newer bands and 'heavier/faster' music in half, just like it did to everything else when it first came out.  Yeah, metal has gotten a lot faster, heavier, and more extreme..with a heck of a lot more radio airplay than metal had when I first started listening to it.  There's just something really dark and twisted about this album that makes everything else light hearted in comparison..I'll put the atmosphere loaded on this masterpiece against anything else 'extreme,' be it Emperor or Cannibal Corpse or Slipknot or whoever.  You can almost hear the drugs and anger on this thing..I love it!  It might be slow sometimes, but its the kind of bone-crunching slow that can roll over anything. <br />   For the remix..my opinion is rather divided.  Yeah, it sounds very different.  I'm not sure how to compare it to the original, I guess I don't mind having both, because I can hear different things on both that just give it a different aura.  I enjoyed hearing the vocals and some guitar things I didn't notice that much on the original, but I thought the original was done rather well, so.. <br />   As a hard-core metal fan, I'd just have to advise you to get both versions.  Money well spent.   <br />
0307276902|5.0|I have personally never experienced anything like James Frey but the way he describes his experiences makes it so real. I couldn't put this book down. The style of writing is perfect for the story.A great book for teenagers and up. He is inspirational.
B000B86S1Q|5.0|Loved this book! Great write, great plot, very fun storyline with a very deep undertone! Ladies you will love this book!
B00000IL29|5.0|One of the best albums from my favorite period in jazz history.  Put it in your collection.
B000B8QEYC|4.0|Same old, same old. I'm an Enya fan, but the sound is just the same as awlways. It's a good album, but just like the rest. Does she ever just get bored doing the same old, or is she stuck in a duldrum/time warp?
0525948023|5.0|The value of a spiritual book is measured by how its message translates and impacts the reader. Just as it happen with a poem or a work of art. As such Mr. Tolle's books are great. <br /> <br />Yes, the core message is perhaps 5,000 years old, but the same can be said of most things, including painting, which is some 10,000 years old. The fact is the Mr. Tolle is quite original in the method in which he presents this age-old truth. It can also be said that other people wrote with a higher philosophical depth and analytical clarity. Mr. Tolle, though, exceeds in clarity, in easiness to put the subject to practice, in practical examples, in variety of methods (three distinct methods of meditation), in being free of judgment and of negatives, in not belonging to any school (he is just looking for the truth), in pleasantness, and if you hear him on tape, on the calmness inherent in his voice, which reflects a level of internal peace that is felt and becomes a key part of the message. In short, it is grand. <br /> <br />I experienced some \\"now\\" moments early on (a car accident, recite poems to a large audience, penetrating the depth of the eyes of the girl I love) and they all had the same elements in common: time stopped; space melted; deep feeling of peace and joy; my personal intellectual mind rested while I somehow connected to another intelligence that felt in harmony with my innermost being, that was inhering or an integral part of it (versus the intelligence of my mind, which is external, different and separate from my consciousness), and of higher capacity (as the complexities of my body, such as my DNA or my brain; in the car accident I manage to maneuver calmly, just naturally, saving people); a feeling of oneness, as if the borders somehow partially melt allowing me to feel the innermost of people's essence.  <br /> <br />Some of the things that Mr. Tolle mentions I had already felt from my own angle (and he helped me understand them better), for example, I felt that the infinite (or God if you prefer) was not love, but somehow higher than love. In prolong moments of satori (or \\"now\\") I felt the infinite as: \\"peace\\" (you can never minimize the huge and immense sense of tranquility or serenity in stillness), as \\"joy\\" (absolute bliss; which, is not a sense of immense pleasure or anything subject to cycles, but rather a serene, soft and permanent or imperturbable inherent joy) and as \\"one-ness\\" (something akin to the relationship of a wave of the sea -us- to the sea, or gnana). I call these three perceptions together as the state of \\"perfect harmony\\".  <br /> <br />Although I did not come to the conclusion through my own experience, but by reading, I latter realized that perhaps peace and joy are one and are called \\"absolute bliss\\" (also called ananda) and that the sages add two other attributes two Brahman (the totality): \\"absolute existence\\" (perhaps equivalent to YHWH's \\"I Am That I Am\\"; to being, instead of existing, or being out of time; also called sat) and \\"absolute consciousness\\" (the source of all consciousness, the sea of our \\"I am\\"; also called chit). Love is the thirst in us to return and merge into the absolute and/or being, either directly (mysticism) or thorough a loved one (all love is love to the infinite). To the extent that love implies an emptiness that we hunger to fill, it seems incorrect to apply it to the infinite, which is in perfect harmony. On the other hand, to the extent that the infinite is all (as the word imply) and we incorporate pantheism, perfect harmony (the summary of the attributes) is by definition a kind of self-love, thus love is what is felt towards itself by a being in perfect harmony and since we are all part of the absolute, this is how It feels toward (loves) us. <br /> <br />Having felt the transcendent, so to say, I felt that there is no space for \\"sin\\", since that would imply that He or It is offended by our actions, thus that It does not have ananda and perfect harmony. I also realized that there is no devil, since that would imply that the spiritual realm could be evil, not infinite (not all), in conflict with itself, in time, and out of balance, instead of in perfect harmony, as I felt It was. Reading Mr. Tolle I realized that any effort to conceptualize the infinite is an ego or mind approach. Reading Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj (I Am That) I realized that as long as we conceptualize ourselves as a person (ego or mind), we tend to conceptualize God as an individual, egotist mind (even anthropomorphic); to the extent that we realize that we are (one with) all, we will also see It as the infinite, or all. In other words, we (as a person, or as a culture or religion) perceive God/It/the-infinite according to our level of spirituality. <br /> <br />Reading Mr. Tolle I realized that that this feeling of bliss, union, and calm, or epiphany, or enlightenment, or satori, can be experienced (at least at a lower level of intensity), to the extent that we move into the \\"now,\\" pretty much all the time. After reading Mr. Tolle, I now find myself experiencing my being through my senses (instead of only through my mind), perceiving new sounds, images, and scent from the environment and feeling a sense of delight, communication, and tranquility. In the road, for example, if you detach from the mind, you can get a feeling of objects moving towards you and passing, just the movement, and you as part of it, with no analysis, no judgment, just being, and being at peace and joy. I have used the concept of the \\"now\\" to kill anxiety (not always successfully), to sleep sound before a tough day (something I could not do before), to connect with my innermost, and to feel the innermost of loved ones more easily. Most of the time, though, I am not there. Not yet. <br /> <br />My main difference with most sages is that they tend to be ascetics and thus are inclined to identify erotic love as not too spiritual. I respectfully disagree. While sex, even good sex canbe mostly pleasure (union of matter and form: body beauty); romantic love can be erotic and can go from a sense of union with your couple (romantic, or union of the souls) all the way to spiritual (union with All) and at that level can transform into absolute harmony for a prolong period of time, if we can call it time when it is stopped or not there.
