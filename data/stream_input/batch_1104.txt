0765326353|5.0|I've  been a fan of Sanderson ever since I found out about him after he was picked to finish the Wheel of Time series, and I'm pleased to report that his latest offering did not disappoint. The Way of Kings is a fascinating fantasy which promises good things for the series.     The world of Roshar is detailed and has the most unique ecology that I think  I've ever seen in a fantasy novel, shaped  by massive \\" highstorms' that blow across almost the entire world every few days, think \\"coral reef on land\\" and you get the general idea. The  cultures of the world are also interesting and have lots of little details to them that make them feel different then your average generic fantasy cultures.    The setup of the novel is a peace treaty between the Alethi and the Parshendi, a non-human race, which gets betrayed by the Parshendi on the night of the celebration of the treaty when they send an assassin to kill the Alethi king, which results in a war that has been going on for 6 years when then novel proper starts and which forms the backdrop of most the novel.     The characters are also quite interesting, and all the main ones have complex backstories (though a lot of it's only hinted at in this book). Kaladin is the central character of the book, he gets the most pagetime and also gets flashback chapters that give insight into what happened to make him the person he is during the novel. He's an ex-soldier turned slave (through circumstances that are explained in the flashbacks) who gets sold into a very nasty situation and has to try to survive, while dealing with some issues from his past. My only complaint with him is that he gets a little more emo over certain spoilery things then he really oughta.    The next main character is Dalinar, the brother of the late king and uncle of the current king, a great general and a warrior,who's been having visions, seemingly of the past, and is worried that he might be going insane, he's also dealing with a possible assassinationattempt on the king, and his relationship with a former friend of his which went sour after the assassination of the former king. He's also trying to figure out a way to end the war that has been going on so long and which he believes threatens the stability of his country, as all the high-ranking nobility is off at war, leaving relatively few people to mind the fort back home. Dalinar's viewpoint involves several epic battles, and lots of navel-gazing as Dalinar tries to deal with his changing viewpoint on his society.    The last main viewpoint character is Shallan Davar, a member of a minor noble house from the country of Jah Keved which has fallen on hard times due to the death of her father under rather mysterious circumstances and the massive amount of debt and ill-will he racked up beforehand. Shallan is on a daring mission to try to solve her family's troubles, which involves studying with Jasnah, the sister of the Alethi king in order to try to steal a valuable artifact from her that could enable her family to pay off their debts, in the process Shallan ends up being drawn into Jasnah's research on the Parshendi and the possible explanations of their actions, which provides hints of the plot of the series to come. Shallan's story starts off rather slow, but gets interesting later on as she gets into way more then she bargained for.     There are several characters that get relatively minor viewpoints, the most major is Szeth-son-son-Vallano the assassin sent by the Parshendi, who provides us with some literally gravity-defying martial arts (he has the supernatural power to affect gravity in various ways which he uses to great effect to kill people in some innovative ways), others are Dalinar's son Adolin, the late king's widow, one of Kaladin's co-workers,and several people who's connection to the main plot, if any, is obscure (the last take place in Interludes and  are apparently meant to give us a wider taste of the world)    Brandon's magic systems areone of his  greatest strengths, and from the little we see in this book (it's deliberately light on details, which are said to be coming in book 2), it looks like he's created another batch of interesting interelated magic systems, most of the magic we have any real information on is run by Stormlight, a glowing energy infused into gemstones by the highstorms, such as the above mentioned gravity-manipulation, and Soulcasting, which uses a device to transmute things into different things, and also various other devices, used to do various stuff (heat rooms, send writing across long distances, numb pain and others), and the ancient magical Shardblades and Shardplate, which can no longer be reproduced, and which make any warrior that owns them nearly invincible against anybody that doesn't also have them.     The main problem with this book is that it leaves you desperately wanting more and the next one won't be out til 2012, darn you Brandon Sanderson! Also, if you have back problems, you might want to buy it in ebook form, as it's a rather lengthy tome and quite large. Other then that, BUY THE BOOK! You will not regret it.
0060899220|4.0|This review is from: Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly (Paperback). If you are looking for a combination of Hells Kitchen meets Cops, you're in for a treat. Anthony Bourdain's fast paced memoir details the many rises and falls throughout his exciting career, from junkie to star chef, and everything in between. You'll meet some incredibly disturbed characters, including ex-con sous chefs, mobster restaurant owners, junkie cooks, and you'll learn what really goes on behind the kitchen doors of some of the most well known restaurants in New York City. The writing is super-charged with vivid imagery and a lot of humor. But beware, this book's language, drug and sexual situations make it a definite R rating. You don't have to be a Top Chef fan to enjoy this book. It's a great inside view of the business end of the restaurant world, and why you'll want to be very careful what you select from the buffet line. A definite two thumbs up!
B000WEMH3C|1.0|Don't waste your money on this cover.  Mine was tearing after 6 months and after 1 year it is cracked & falling apart.  Weber shouldn't even sell these.  They are only good if you keep your grill in the garage, out of the sun.  Buy the better quality cover, it should last.
B002UNMWAG|1.0|If you loved the original, you'll probably hate this. If you hated the original, you'll almost definitely hate this.    I loved the original Boondock Saints. The plot of this sequel isn't horrible, but the dialogue is some of the worst I've ever heard (it doesn't even compare favorably to the type of movies they run late at night on Cinemax).    It's hard to believe that this film was written by the same man who wrote the original. In any case, if you dive in, prepare to be deeply insulted.
B004JOU7NS|5.0|This CD is Gregg Allman at his best. The CD is great blues rock at it's best. You get Gregg's \\"Deep Blues\\" vocals & organ play, plus, some steller backing musicians, such as Doyle Bramhall II (From Texas, & featured on Eric Clapton's 2007 & 2010 Guitar Festivals), plus T-Bone Burnett on guitar, & Mac Rebennack (Dr.John, from New Orleans on piano), plus several others. This CD was produced by the legendary \\"Roots Music\\", producer, T-Bone Burnett, who won Grammy Album of the Year for 2001, with the Soundtrack to the \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou\\", Movie.    The T-Shirt is fantastic, this package is well worth the price, just for the T-Shirt alone. This T-Shirt is a great reproduction T-Shirt, from Gregg's 1974 Tour. It has \\"Gregg Allmans 1974 Tour\\", and his picture on the front, and it has all the tour dates/cities on the back of the T-Shirt. This alone is a great, vintage, collector's item . I know I love mine. I highly recommend this combo, if you can find one. Best Buy had it for a limited time only. I was lucky enough to get one from Best Buy, while they still had some.  Thanks!!!!
B002ZG993Q|3.0|Ok, first off, my 3 star rating means that I enjoyed the film and don't regret spending the time watching it. I didn't think it was fantastic, but I also didn't think it was horrible.     Further disclosure: I don't particularly like George Clooney. I have nothing against the man, I simply don't find him charismatic on the screen in most cases (for contrast, I do find Cary Grant and John Cusack, for example, to be charismatic and able to carry most films they were ever involved in).    Disclosure is out of the way, so let's get to it.    This is a film that is not heavy on dialogue. This production style hearkens back to some of the great films of yore when the directors would rely on the visual information heavily to tell their stories. It works quite well in this film. I happened to like this aspect. If you think you can't handle a film that is sparse on dialogue to tell you what you need to know, this may not be for you.    This is a film with slow pacing. I don't mean that in a bad way. Again, this style hearkens back to an earlier age when such pacing was relatively common and not riddled with explosions every 5 minutes to keep viewers interested. If you found Lawrence of Arabia, Bridge on the River Kwai, Gone With the Wind, or even Blade Runner to be \\"too slow\\" and therefore \\"boring\\", this is probably not the film for you. That's not intended as an insult, just a bow to reality. Younger viewers especially have become accustomed to fast pacing, for better or for worse.    The story is intriguing and well-developed and the acting is par for the course (not superb (but again, I've never found Clooney to be all that believable when it comes to emotional range...although I do believe he does a pretty good job for what his role calls for here) and not bad).    Ultimately, I feel that the fact that several big questions were not resolved detracts from what otherwise would be a very fine story.    Bottom line: Good film, but could have been much better with a few loose ends tied down. Additionally, not for those with a short attention span.
0345495004|5.0|In the book Loving Frank, Nancy Horan presents Frank Lloyd Wright's life thru Mamah Borthwick Cheney's eyes. It allows us to learn more about him as a person, a father, a husband, an architect, a lover, but specially as a dreamer.  At the same time, has the duality to present the life of a woman back in 1900's when they were considered as part of their husband's trusts.<br /><br />Mamah Borthwick Cheney is an incredible narrator in the story. It is more than the main character, it is the voice of the novel.  She is a type of filter to shed light on all the events surrounding her.  You not only will get to meet Frank, but you will enter a time of great cultural achievements in America.<br /><br />Nancy Horan interrelates all the stories to create a great line of events than shaped the lives of all the characters in the story. The characters are developed exquisitely and the book is well written. She did an extensive investigation and integrates the real life facts of the characters with the fiction lines of the novel.  In a way they turn into one.<br /><br />The book is an easy read and will keep you attached to it. It is a great way to learn interesting facts about American culture and development as well as an easy way to learn more about the Woman's movement. For those of you looking for your creative identity, Mamah will be a great inspiration.
1439177783|5.0|I bought this book on Monday and it's Wednesday, and I have already finished it.  It is a very easy read, and an amazing story of her life.  It really makes you see and feel the pressure that Hollywood stars go through.  I am so happy that she got the help that she needed, and that she is happy in her life with Ellen.  A good read for women who struggle with image to see her go from so low to so high.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Some really poor reviews on here, by people who are either jocks and couldn't keep up with the pace or subject matter of conversations or people who expected something different (the morality issues of facebook...which it never claimed to be a film about). The film is excellent, both in execution (from a great soundtrack to excellent cinematography) and the script. Just because you personally don't relate to a character (whether he is too intelligent, too angry, too self absorbed) doesn't make it a bad movie, take Gran Torino for example...i found myself literally frustrated and angry at Clint Eastwood's character for the first 45 minutes before realising what great character development they had achieved to evoke such a raw emotion.    There's a lot of underlying themes throughout the movie that it becomes much more than a simple tale of how some white privileged punk became rich. Seen it twice and considering picking up the blu-ray to watch it again.
B00005JNS0|2.0|CARS is by far the weakest of the collaborations by Disney and Pixar. The animation is certainly up to Pixar's very high standards. Younger children will love the colorful universe that appears onscreen. CARS is a NASCAR-inspired tale of a world populated strictly by motor vehicles. It is the story of Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), rookie racer nonpareil, who is in a run-off in a three way tie in the Piston Cup. Lightning is young, cocky, self-assured, unpolished, and in love with flash and glitter.<br /><br />On his way to the run-off, Lightning accidentally ends up exiting I-40 to find himself on a forgotten stretch of The Mother Road, Route 66, speeding through the forgotten town of Radiator Springs. Pulled over, he faces the town judge, \\"Doc\\" Hudson (voiced by Paul Newman, a lifelong racer himself). Doc is about to let Lightning go when the town Attorney Sally Carrera (a Porsche, voiced by Bonnie Hunt), convinces Doc to lock him up for destruction of property. Lightning must do Community Service before he can get on his way.<br /><br />I found myself strangely troubled by CARS. The movie has an odd anti-capitalist cant to it, denigrating success in favor of a retreat into a kind of colorless anonymity. There's nothing wrong at all with caring for one's neighbors or supporting one's community, but having a healthy sense of community does not preclude someone from enjoying their own accomplishments.<br /><br />CARS lacks the heart of the TOY STORY films and FINDING NEMO. Quite surprisingly, the characters in CARS aren't very nice to one another, or, for that matter, nice at all. Lightning is cocky, and riding for a fall. That's OK, it's a classic plotline, but the way it all plays out gave me a distinctly uncomfortable feeling. The morality of CARS is convoluted and unclear, and certainly much more complicated than it should be for a film supposedly directed at children. Personal vendettas underlie much of the film's momentum.<br /><br />Lightning is a self-described \\"one man show\\" who wants to win the big race in order to get the big bucks and the big endorsements, and has perhaps cheated to make his way into the run-off race.<br /><br />Sally Carerra has Lightning convicted not because of the minor property damage he has caused but because she dislikes the glitz and glam he admires (something she turned her back on when she came to Radiator Springs). She derides Lightning throughout the film by giving him an unkind nickname.<br /><br />Doc turns out to be a world famous retired racer himself, who, after a devastating accident, was unable to make a comeback and was forgotten by a fickle public. Embittered, he retreated to Radiator Springs to brood on his disappointments. Doc wants Lightning to pay the price for his own unhappiness.<br /><br />The rest of the denizens of the town spend most of their time complaining about how the Interstate has passed them by. Their shops are dusty. There's no business. But when Lightning the stranger comes to town, they treat him with all the hick small town xenophobia they can muster. Only Mater, a dopey, buck-toothed and rusty tow truck befriends him, taking him tractor tipping in the night (they get chased off by Frank, an enraged combine). Mater calls Lightning, \\"my best friend,\\" but Lightning never reciprocates.<br /><br />Ironically, things don't change in Radiator Springs until Lightning repaves the road. The rest of the town's cars get to work, painting and fixing and replacing the burnt-out neon bulbs on the roadside joints. Radiator Springs spruces up, but it definitively says something that not one of the natives bothered to get off their rusty tailpipes to do anything to fix the town until after they force Lightning to do the dirty work.<br /><br />Of course, once they get the place in order, Lightning's their hero. Having learned a lesson about community, Lightning goes on to a surprising finish in the run-off race.<br /><br />With its ethics badly in need of a tuneup, I think it'd be all right for your kids to miss CARS.
B00005JN8Z|5.0|I received the dvd on time and in excellent shape.    I had not seen this move in decades, and it is one of the greats.    grace2u  Don R. Fauquier
B004EJUMT2|4.0|Very, very good post-modern Metal album. As everyone else here has pointed out, part of what sets this apart from the rest is in the excellent clean vocals - quite refreshing in the \\"extreme\\" metal genre to hear someone SING. Though one could rightly argue this isn't really extreme, other than perhaps the Mercyful Fate-inspired-devil-worship lyrical theme. I'd like to point out that this is NOWHERE close to the musical majesty of Fate,though, and that's not a slam on Ghost or their talents but just the cold hard facts.This kid hasn't an eighth the range of the King. The \\"Praise hail Satan\\" lyrics also don't seem quite as shocking (or scary..Yawn) as they did in 1983/84, and quite frankly I could have done without them.The ghost(ahem...sorry!)of BOC is also much in evidence,particularly in the mood, which I found to be nothing short of brilliant in this context. Bottom line is that they incorporate some interesting musical influences into their little unholy stew, mixing modern production techniques and their own personality to make something well worth listening to, silly lyrics not withstanding. I can see this having good cross-over appeal to the less Heavily inclined, without sacrificing (sorry!) their musical integrity.
014241543X|3.0|Seventeen year old Mia has many things to be thankful for.  She has an adoring and sweet boyfriend, a pretty exciting career in music and a possible scholarship to Julliard.  She was a loving family - one that she actually likes to spend time with... and a snow day, where everyone is at home and a road trip is in the making - well that's just icing on the cake.<br /><br />And then in an instant...<br /><br />it is all gone.<br /><br />A tragic accident leaves Mia in a state of in between.... as she sees the devastation before her and an unsure future, Mia has really, only one decision to make....<br /><br />should she stay?<br /><br />If I stay is a book about relationships.  It's about who we are and who we hope to be... and in some cases, it is about who we were.<br /><br />As Mia contemplates the life she had, filled with memories of growing up, making pancakes with her mom, school work her dad, watching her baby brother come into this world, and falling in love with the boy she knows she was meant to be with.....all while laying in a coma on a hospital bed hovering between life... and death.<br /><br />She has to now see if she is strong enough to movie into a future that is so different from what she has known.  Mostly Mia has to ask herself if she is strong enough to move forward, when it seems so much easier just to let it all slip away.<br /><br />It is hard to review this book without slipping into spoiler after spoiler, so if my thoughts here seem.... cryptic, it is intentional.  I found this book to be a fast read that really did not fully impact me until after I was finished... now I sit here and the question lies on my lips...<br /><br />what would I have done if I had to choose?<br /><br />This book is real.  This book is powerful and fans of YA will enjoy the highly emotional roller coaster of Mia's life - before, during.... and after.
B002ZG993Q|1.0|This has to be one of the worst movies ever made unless you enjoy watching Mr. Clooney walking. Dialogue is terrible at best and it is a TOTAL DISAPPOINMENT when one thinks what could have been done with the story.
B002VPE1X4|5.0|Works as described.  Fits my Olympus Stylus and an extra battery.  Seems secure enough and looks pretty well made.
B00003CX96|5.0|I have loved this movie since I first saw it many years ago. It is a funny, heartwarming story about middle-American couple, their bicycle racing son, and his pals. You will recognize most of the actors, especially the three pals, as all of them have excelled in later movies (some on TV as well), with a few Oscar nominations to boot. This did win a justly-deserved Academy Award in 1979 for Best \\"Writing directly for the screen\\" beating \\"All That Jazz\\", \\"..And Justice for All\\", \\"The China Syndrome\\", and \\"Manhattan\\". Not bad! It was also nominated for Best Picture, and Scoring: Original Adaptation. I have shown it to many British friends as it is a real American movie with no special effects, bells, whistles, murders, car chases, etc. They all loved it. For those who were too young to see this in 1979, GET IT NOW, INVITE YOUR FRIENDS OVER, MAKE SOME POPCORN AND HAVE A WONDERFUL EVENING.
B00008RH3L|4.0|The Coen Brothers rule.  What extraordinary siblings.  Are they capable of making a BAD movie?  Me thinks not, and Miller's Crossing is another Coen gem.
B003Y5UP44|3.0|I have seen every version of Jane Eyre out there several times and have read the book numerous times.  William Hurt (Rochester) does a decent job but appears a little stiff at times, as though he is struggling with the accent. He also appears stiff and cold because he is not supposed to love the governess nor any woman for that matter. Rochester is deeply in love with a woman he can't have but loves her anyway and so he tortures her in his own way to push her to love him as well.  Jane is slim and young because she is slim and young in the book.  She has eaten very little in years and was always unloved and unwanted.  Jane Eyre is truly a wonderful story, I definitely would recommend this movie.  It would be great if Amazon would carry some of the newer versions as well.
0470638842|5.0|A great high level look at social media and its overall impact over society. Relatively easy read and easy to follow which is important when dealing on a subject of this magnitude. A definite read if you seek to gain a better overall understanding of social media's impact over our daily lives...
0141040343|5.0|Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a masterpiece and the Penguin Hardcover classic version is pure pleasure to read.  The screen printed cover is novel and appealing - though some of the image came away with the sticker on the back.  It has a good size/shape/heft and the pages have a nice thickness to them.  I did not notice any errors in the text.  I have not yet read the introduction to this book, but have greatly enjoyed the introductions included in other Penguin Hardcover classics (especially Jane Eyre).<br />I definitely recommend this copy of Pride and Prejudice.  Not only is it delightful to read, but it also looks lovely on the shelf.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|I watched a few episodes of this 5th series on BBC America and just didn't get into it. Someone suggested that I start with series 1 instead of continuing with series 5; I took that advice and really liked series 1 to 4 (and specials). I then tried series 5 again - I don't know why, but then I liked this series.<br /><br />There is a new Doctor starting in this series and a new sidekick, Amy Pond. I liked them both.<br /><br />The part of the first episode with Amy Pond as a little girl was very funny - fish sticks and pudding (YUCK!!). Only the Doctor would eat that I guess.<br /><br />I thought all the episodes were at least good, but some are really outstanding. The two-parter with the reptile people who live underground on Earth was well done and gave some food for thought as well. Another two-parter shows the return of the (quantum) Angels which had been featured in the (great) episode, Blink, from an earlier series, but this time the Angels are much, much more dangerous.<br /><br />I liked the Lodger episode, not so much for the story line, but more for how the Doctor interacted with his roommate. Truly funny in parts.<br /><br />The final two episodes were another two-parter. A Cyberman's head attacks Amy - this is really something to see. The Doctor's old enemies build the Pandorica to contain him - they claim he is the most dangerous thing in the universe. The time travel line employed does get a little hard to follow here and there, but it is still a good story. River returns in these episodes and is quite good.<br /><br />The Christmas Special was well done and full of surprises, if a little sad.<br /><br />Season 6 will be rolling out soon. Looking forward to it.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I love this movie! The story was very inspirational and uplifting. There are few movies I enjoy watching repeatedly, but I've enjoyed this one every time I've seen it.
B004GF244K|5.0|Yes, I don't saw the show, yet. But I already loved it.  The musicians and the theme is \\"al off good\\" (literal translate of the brazilian expression \\"tudo de bom\\").  But Amazon need be more carefull with the especifications: BD, Region 1 isn't \\"USA and Canada\\" only!    The regions are: (for)  Blu-ray Discs  Region A/1: North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia.   Region B/2: Europe, Greenland, French territories, Middle East, Africa, Australia and New Zealand.   Region C/3: India, Nepal, Mainland China, Russia, Central and South Asia.     Another think:  Amazon rarely inform if the Disc is captioned or not.   In spite of this, I'll gonna buy it.  Assero
B00005LOUP|5.0|I loved it, I got it for a collection.  Dr. Seuss is a favorite of mine, His stories have been around about as long as I have!  Combine a few heart-stopping moments, the belief and innocence of a child, the story 'behind the story', about maybe why the Grinch was like he was, and you have a timeless movie that is worth watching. . . again and again.
B00364K6YW|5.0|After enjoying the VHS version of the movie for several years, one of the videos in the set became damaged.  In searching for the DVD version of the movie several of the reviews mentioned the picture quality and sound quality were not as good as the VHS version.  I bought it anyway.  Perhaps I am not as critical, but the quality seemed fine to me.
006176759X|4.0|Lauren Conrads book L.A. Candy over all was pretty good. It was really well written and she knows how to keep the reader hooked, Waiting to hear what happens next. It was a lot better than I thought it would be because as a reality star I didnt think she would have much experience in the writing department but she did a really great job. I really enjoyed the book!
B000BQ7BX2|5.0|I found myself not wanting to collect another cycle of Mahler symphonies led by one conductor.  I have the Bernstein, Chailly, Solti, Inbal, etc.  I came to realize that it was best to have a sampling of the symphonies through the eyes of various conductors as I found that I did not care for the Chailly cycle overall.  I read the reviews by others regarding the Bertini cycle and thought here we go again.  I must say that I am totally bowled over by the beauty of each regarding regardless of time of recordeing.  Bertini was able to place his finger and touch these scores in such a way that I felt drawn to the music as I have not been for quite some time. I happened to see reviews shared and wondered who this man was as I have never heard of him until now.  I am grateful to have this set in my collection Mahler symphonies.  It was the Telarc cycle which includes three conductors that cause me to move away from one conducter per cycle but I am glad I found the Bertini.  Give this one a chance.  There is more than Bernstein, etc in this world of Mahler!

B001R4MEYI|5.0|this is the first album that i got from mastodon.to be honest though the first time i heard it i only could like juss a few songs,but as i started listening to em more i liked them better and better.so it had to grown on me lol,but all in all its a great well crafted album.
038533348X|5.0|Among the many Kurt Vonnegut books I have read, this was the first one and today still remains to be my favorite book by him and perhaps of all time. While I believe \\"Cat's Cradle\\" to be Vonnegut's best piece of literature he has many other great stories and \\"Cat's Cradle\\" works as a great introduction to his style and humor. What separates Vonnegut's satire from those of lesser authors is the wit and black humor that is embedded in every page. With the eccentric and eclectic cast of characters, notably a midget, Vonnegut is able to comment on all of the faults of the modern man while still maintaining the humor which makes the book very easy to pick up and even harder to put down once started. \\"Cat's Cradle\\" can be read in two ways: as a humorous warning apocalpytic tale of a man at the end of the world, or as an in depth look at the plight of man and the many pitfalls of our society. Neither way is wrong because the book fits both instances so well that it's hard to find any fault with it; it's neither too serious or too goofy. In fact it's this balance of seriousness and humor that makes Vonnegut's writing so enticing and enjoyable. If you enjoy apocalyptic stories, social commentaries, and clever and subtle humor then you will find \\"Cat's Cradle\\" to be highly enjoyable journey and will re-visit it many times throughout the years.
B002ZG99TK|5.0|Why is it that people love going to the movies so much? Escapism. This is exactly what this movie is. Great escapism.    This movie is pure fun. It's loud, fast, and once it gets going it keeps you at the edge of your seat until it's done. It's one of those movies where once you reach the end, you feel like you've been holding your breath the entire time. It gets your heart pounding.     Anyone who likes Speed would like this movie.
B001CC7PKS|5.0|DareDevil : The Director's Cut is a great movie! It was  a great experience!  I am not talking about DareDevil theatrical cut seen in Movie Theaters in 2003. I am talking about DareDevil Blu Ray Director's Cut of this film. It is wonderful Marvel comics masterpiece written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson!  Ben Affleck is Daredevil/Matt Murdock, Colin Farrell is Bulls-eye,  Jennifer Garner is  Elektra,  Michael Clark Duncan is Wilson Fisk  also known as the Kingpin.  Matt Murdock is a blind lawyer from Hell's Kitchen.  He travels on rooftops at night and becomes the mask vigilante, Daredevil.  I thought the DarDevil : Director's Cut is  great because the story in this version is better. The story is clearer and makes more sense. The Director's Cut of DareDevil is closer vision of the Frank Miller's Run the  Marvel comic books. The movie has a cameo from Stan Lee, Frank Miller, and Kevin Smith! DareDevil is created by Stan Lee and Bill Everatt.  I like the Marvel comic book and this film is very close to the comics. If you saw the Theatrical version, you have to see Daredevil : Director's Cut on Blu ray! A
031603438X|4.0|It would seem the very thing that kept Keith Richards healthy enough to survive all his near misses with law and limb, plus his famously gritty drug of choice was a musical connection he made with the minds and fingertips of African Amercian guitarists like Muddy Waters and Chuck Berry. These heroes of the blues left America for Europe because segregation was so bad in the states. Little Ketih was hungry for their albums so he could steal every lick, and ultimately he'd play with them, for them, around them for years. This is before he began to shape his own tunes and figure out that you could play Brown Sugar backwards and get a product like Jumping Jack Flash. It's the story of a guitar hero as a child and what happened when he discovered that he'd been chosen to be one of those rare people to fall into the category of legend. It all starts with a feeling.
0671027344|5.0|This is a must read. I read it in an afternoon and since have read it two more times. Great book!
B0038QMREA|5.0|I first heard this guy on NPR, a live broadcast concert.  I kept coming back to it in the archives, the songs were so catchy and different, I finally had to purchase an album and am glad I did.  His guitar tunings are unique and his voice quite interesting and pleasing.  I love listening to the words, rather than just hearing the song.  I was surprised to discover he is Swedish, no detectable accent.  I love this album and have now purchased a second one by him.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I had expected a great deal from this movie being a fan of Aguilera, and this movie completely exceeded my expectations.    Her acting was wonderful, and her singing and dancing was just superb. This was a really fun movie filled with music, dancing, and romance. Truly, one of the best feel-good movies in a long time about a girl who just wants to sing, and is given the chance on a smaller, yet more colorful stage.     Definitely recommend this.
B001S86J0I|5.0|Great comedy that has slipped under the radar.  Tim Allen sometimes evokes negative criticism because of his OTT brand of humour (as in Zoom). This one is a classic supported by great actors namely Weaver/Rickman and a host of unsung heros. Here in NZ you cannot even get a copy at any price so thank the lord for Amazon ! Only clanger is the cover that reverses the Rickman/Allen pictures.
B004EQAVHI|5.0|Scarily good movie.<br /><br />Based on a book by Kazuo Ishiguro, this movie just pulls at your heartstrings and doesn't let go.<br /><br />Its based in a different society than ours, one that ours could turn into, where we clone certain members of our society and put the clones in schools and then into villages where we gather them, once they've grown old enough, and harvest their organs.<br /><br />The three main characters are three of these such people who are unlucky enough to be born into such a status. We follow their lives from childhood as they grow up in fear of having their first, second, third, and fourth procedures, all the way up to the day they \\"complete\\" and die.<br /><br />It is sad, and heartbreaking, but so very human. A really amazing movie that captures the human soul.
0143118420|5.0|Men, this book is NOT just for women. it is a book about one woman's journey, but we can all get something out of this.  Ms. Gilbert's writing style is breezy and light, even when she is soul searching.  It is worth reading for everyone.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|Really fabulous movie. Its a shame we have to come back for Part 2 (and buy it, lol) but so far, judging from this movie its well worth it. Plus, for once the book readers and the only-movie watchers are semi-satisfied. That's sort of a guarantee. Things are missing, things are modified to make them \\"cooler\\" but it works.     Hollywood has to change things like they intend to with the next movie and Snape's scene, but that so that the same feelings we felt from reading the book can be felt in a movie. You can't translate things exactly the same from book to screen and make people understand and believe and feel it.     This movie is well worth the leap of faith.     The kids are out of Hogwarts now, and while that could have backfired on them, it worked really well. Everything really worked really well. They are much more experienced actors and it shows. The trio in particular are completely fabulous in this one.     I'll be buying this version, on blue-ray, merely because it was THAT good. I've been a fan of Harry Potter for roughly eleven years now, and I was not at all disappointed. Ended up watching this movie twice in theaters, which I have never done.     The effects are not cheesy, even the \\"shield\\" or \\"protection\\" magics, and its pretty clear to anyone; it doesn't skip too many things that the \\"only-movie watchers\\" need to know. Did I have to explain a few things to the guy next to me that kept taking me away from the movie? Sure. But I have to admit, I had to explain a great deal less than what I thought they'd cut out.     Worth buying and watching again and again. Best Harry Potter movie yet.
B002UZCJP2|5.0|If you are a Bruce Willis fan, you do NOT want to miss this movie.  It is not only an action movie, but will make you think as well. . .   sci fans will enjoy it but others can as well.  It is a commentary on technology but not preachy.
1416583432|4.0|I am a dog lover. I like anything about dogs. I thought this book helped me to understand them better. LOL I look at my own a little differently now. I guess I was one to treat mine as more \\"human\\" a lot of times.  I learned quite a bit, and understand more about dogs now. I liked how she wrote, and was also a story about herself and her own dog. I have tried a few things that she recommended. They seem to work. I guess I'll never look at dogs quite the same! Nice read.
0446613444|5.0|This is the first Michael Connelly book I've read, yet is the second book in the Harry Bosch series. Makes sense? Well the first book was sold out so I started with the second book. Thoroughly entertaining book. Other reviews mention that this book is ridden with cliches and I can certainly agree with that but that doesn't particularly bother me. What bothered me more was the constant use of acronyms which sometimes had me scratching my head. e.g. RHD. (Robbery Homicide Department), DEA (Department of External Affairs or Drug Enforcement Agency/Administration it's actually the latter)  These are just minor gripes/nitpicking and I can whole-heartedly recommend this book for action fans. I've found another good author.
0316098337|5.0|Room is all at once captivating, suspenseful, highly emotional, dark & twisted, and yet full of hope.  I've never experienced such a wide range of emotions while reading a book.  The bond that the author draws between mother (\\"Ma\\") and son (\\"Jack\\") is real and palpable.  If you have a small child of your own (as I do), I think you'll relate to this book in a deeper way.  I don't want to give away anything that happens, but my recommendation is to read this book, you won't be able to put it down.
B00008AWOD|5.0|I always seem to find bands a few albums into their career, which pisses me off a little with Placebo. I would have been a freshman in college when they first came out, but being over the pond in America, we didn't get this kind of music, especially not in my college town. So it took almost two decades, but I'm so glad they've carved a niche in my music library.     However, with finding bands latter, it also means that I never have to experience the \\"oh, they've sold out\\" period or \\"they're not like they used to be,\\" which seems to plague the latter Placebo albums. It's the new albums that attract me and let me find the older material. Placebo, Muse, Radiohead, Death Cab for Cutie, White Stripes, the Killers among others...all seem to lead me back to the IT album, which I find never seems to live up to my expectations. They're good, some truly excellent, but still don't warrant the same emotion as those first songs that you \\"discover\\". And for Placebo, it was this album about two years ago. Favorite tracks include This Picture, Sleeping with Ghosts, The Bitter End, Special Needs, and I'll be Yours. Sure, every album has one or two that I skip over, but this is one of the bands that does the miraculous job of hooking me into practically all of their tracks. I'm glad they survived the last 15+ years, and I hope we see more to come.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This book is great!! I would recommend it to everyone. If you are going to read this make sure you read the first two books first otherwise you wont get whats happening. Read this series!!!
B004A86WZU|5.0|Never having personally seen Katherine Jenkins in concert, I've only been able to appreciate her gifts through CD's and DVD's.  I have a growing collection of DVD's of various artists & genres. But I will say that this concert DVD is far and away the finest I have ever seen of ANY type !  Katherine desrves the oppulent settings here and she uses them to the fullest advantage.  The music, costumes, set changes, choreography and pacing make this the one NOT to miss !  When will the US start to appreciate her as much as the UK has ?  This DVD may be the start.  Thank you.
0307454541|5.0|I know, you are all like--WOW 2 days! But, hey, I am not a huge reader here. Good novels like these are hard to find \\"in my book,\\" [pun intended], and actually as can be seen above my per review, I am not a 'verified purchaser.' That is correct. I liked this book so much that I picked it up one day off my brothers bookshelf, lay down on a chair feet swinging away, and into the book I fell fell fell FELL. Admittedly, the names first confused me a bit [her 'guardian' and Blomkovist [sp.?] but eventually I got it all straightened out. Anyway, it is a long read. So definitely keep that in mind. But that can be a good thing! Particularly if it is prior to the Superbowl and you are stranded in your house due to the MONSTER STORM 2011!<br /><br />Anyvay...I am interested in reading the other novels now, as I am not sure if any of the characters crossover or not? I know they are not a series... and I suppose I am \\"not yet with it\\" as one of the books [or watch it be this one] has already turned into a movie. I cannot explain this book, hence my rambling. But you know what. You will get it. Because what does a tatoo, a DRAGON tatoo have to do with all that it is a WASP can do? I thought rather funny that Interpol was literally spelled out 'International Police.' Perhaps a translation thing? But Henning Mankel used 'Interpol' in both... I would have to see the original...not that it makes a difference. Can one compare one to Mankel? Well, not really...?? Maybe?? But, just speaking Swedish/English translation it seems as if this has been translated a little more sloppy...and a bit of a British accent underlying somewhere...or maybe that was just how I read it trying to pronounce some of those words lmao. lots of 'j's after the letter 'k'. j/k FIVE *****<br /><br />vAl~*
1439133948|5.0|This is one where I waffled with the star rating, but ultimately I always like Ms. Bujold's books enough that I end up reading them again so I'm going with a five.     This one didn't hold my attention as well as some of her previous work, but part of that could be that I got a whiff of the ending and was dragging my feet. Too, the opening was a little awkward, with Miles wandering around lost, and it took me a couple tries to get into things. I think it might have worked better if the story had simply started a few days earlier so there was no need to go back and explain so much in summary. Things picked up after the first few chapters.    As far as plot goes, Cryoburn has Miles out and about, away from home, getting kidnapped and dealing with a new society on a planet we haven't seen before. It had a similar feel to Diplomatic Immunity, though I missed having Ekatarin as a main character. I also missed the rich cast of characters that was developed in Civil Campaign and earlier books. I have to admit I'm not crazy about Roic as a POV character since he's ordinary, arguably to the point of boring, which is rare in a Bujold character. He also doesn't really have any goals of his own (after he escapes his confinement in the early chapters) that would make his POV more engaging.     The overall adventure ended up being fun, though, and I did like the kids as new characters. Jin with his animal obsession felt realistically portrayed for a child of that age.    Though this wasn't my favorite Miles adventure, I will happily read more if Ms. Bujold returns to this universe to write another one.
0316067938|1.0|horrible writing, character development, plot, just the worst.  i enjoyed twilight and the other two, this one was just nauseating. one of the biggest letdowns ever, stephanie meyer could have really gone somewhere with this one, but it just bombed.    i also cannot believe she ever majored in english anywhere but at her local community college.  aren't there such things as editors any more? i know, she's laughing all the way to the bank, but really...
B004498KPU|1.0|If you only own a fullscreen tv, DO NOT BUY this dvd set. The picture will not look right on it. The idiots that made this dvd, took a full screen video and laid it inside a 16x9 format. BAD IDEA! These guys could take a lesson from WWE Home Video. On a 16x9 TV the picture is WS, on a FS TV it looks fullscreen. They do this through the dvd authoring. Im no expert on how to do it, I just know it can be done to look right on Fullscreen and Widescreen sets. AND PLEASE, dont give me that..Please come into the future and get a WS TV. I have one, BUT I also still have a Fullscreen TV and expect the dvds to work and look great with no black bars on both of them... IN the USA, they are far more Fullscreen sets than Widescreen sets..
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Very effective cooling. Mounting requires access to the back of the MB. Larger than expected, measure first to make sure it will fit (side panel won't fit anymore on my case). Would recommend to friends.
B003ZTQN1I|1.0|I ordered this CD shortly after seeing the movie thinking that is would be the same singers as the movie.  It is not......I was very unhappy with this CD.  I am not sure who the singer (guy) is in the movie, loved his voice........he is not on this CD.
B004BBDHEK|3.0|I became a huge fan of Yanni when I first heard his \\"Keys To The Imagination\\" and \\"Chameleon Days\\" albums in the early eighties. His music reached a pinnacle with the album \\"If I Could Tell You\\", I saw him in concert live at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles ,along with Patrick O'Hearn in what was a very memorable concert. After his facing several problems(Personnal), his music has settled into a sameness that I find boring. This album offers hope that he is breaking out again, but it is not one of his best. I still consider him one of the best composers of the last 30 years. Until next time.
1567184855|2.0|It is a fascinating book and the uniformity of reports about the spirit world from his patients is compelling. Yet, we know very little of Mr. Newton himself.  He claims to be a PhD but where was he educated? If you do a search you'll come up with nothing (or at least I came up with nothing). He's said to have been on the faculty of higher educational institutions as a teacher. Which institutions and in what capacity?  Again, a blank.     Why isn't there transparency here?  It's not like this information is somehow confidential or sensitive.  All this is suspicious to me and smacks of someone with something to hide. And this taints the legitimacy of his research which remains uncorroborated. Until there are answers to these questions, just two stars from me.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I went to see this movie with my cousin, who saw that the \\"critics\\" gave it a lousy rating.She told me that a few friends of hers had seen it and loved it.So, I agreed to go with her to see it.I gotta tell ya, I was TOTALLY entertained  from start to finish.I think its sad to be a critic.sitting with pencil and paper to pick apart a movie...seems to me that you really miss out on just being entertained..After all, isn't that why we all go to see a movie??? I liked the flick so much,that I plan to buy the DVD.(btw..that tune that Cher sung..\\"You haven't seen the last of me\\" was awesome !!!)
B004EBUXSA|3.0|This chip falls short of the performance boost it needs to match its price tag. For anyone building a Sandy Bridge system I highly recommend reading this article first [...]<br /><br />In short, for a gaming system the $330 i7-2600k offers no performance boost over the $225 i5-2500k (no extra FPS in games). The 2600K does provide a slight processing advantage over the 2500K in desktop applications(multi-tasking, encoding, rendering). But the AMD Phenom X6 1090T with its 6 cores and a price tag of $230, offers as much performance for desktop apps, if not more, as the i7-2600K for again $100 less. Like the tomshardware.com article says; \\"The $100 spread between the Core i5-2500K and Core i7-2600K is only recommended if you want to brag, because you're probably not going to notice any appreciable frame rate difference. The Core i7's strength is only really exploited in heavily-threaded workstation applications, rather than games.\\" And even then you can get that desktop performance from the Phenom 1090t for a third less cash.<br /><br />For a gaming rig put that extra money into RAM or VidCard or your Mobo maybe a good cooling system because the 2500k and 1090t are both ripe and begging for some overclocking.<br /><br />P.S. Dont forget about the P67 and H67 Sandy Bridge chipset recall by Intel.
0007294662|2.0|I rather enjoy this book, and the strong visual components contribute to the bulk of the enjoyment.  This is why I was so disappointed to see random splats of of black ink on many of the pages.  I wondered at first if it was intentional, but as I got further into the book, I realized that it was an error in printing or some kind of accident before the pages were cut apart.
0307272702|5.0|I bought this book because I heard about it on the Radio (CBC Canada).  I was more curious than anything to learn what Gary was saying - I just caught the end of his interview, by chance.    I became absolutely convinced of what the science Gary has revealed in the book to be true.  He totaly challenged my assumptions and predispositions about carbohydrate foods, fats, fruit, weight, heart health, and overall health. I have been committed to eating healthy, based on the facts revealed in this book, and now am reaping the benefits.  I have lost 5 pounds in one week without exercise or being hungry just by avoiding sugars and carbs...and I wasn't even trying to loose weight.  I feel energetic and healthy.    This is a life changing book and unique in that it is not a diet book, but a scientific journey into how our bodies work to process foods and what we can do to eat in a way as to take advantage of the design of the human body.    My thanks to Gary.  I rarely rate anything as high as this, but because of the importance of this book, its 5 stars in my opinion.
B00005NRO3|3.0|Personally, I thought that Scream 2 was NOTHING in comparison to the orginal SCREAM.<br />The first Scream was clever,entertaining and had humor in the right places.<br />This Scream I thought was pretty cheesy with the jokes, the script and the acting. It almost seemed to be mocking the original movie.<br />You never really got to know the characters in this movie so you felt nothing through all of the \\"tense\\" scenes.<br />They could have done a great job with this movie but it just turned out to be pretty mediocre.<br /><br />If you're even a little critical of movies then you probably shouldn't watch this.<br />Though I gotta give them credit for the slight twist at the end.
0525951652|5.0|I am surprise at some of the negative comments on this book.  I found it to be a wonderful read.  And yes, it was over 900 pages but they just flew by for me. I was sorry when I was finished.  Historical fiction is my favorite and I thought Mr. Follett did a fabulous job at \\"weaving\\" a story into this time period.  His characters are engaging as you find yourself having emotions (some positive, some negative) for each of his main characters. The plot development is historical as it takes place during WWI....that is the plot!!  Then he very accurately takes us on a journey through the eyes of a British family, Welch, Americans, Germans and Russians.  These are fictional characters, which makes this historical fiction at it's best! I cannot wait for book 2 in this trilogy.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I purchased this DVD in early 2010 and have been using it consistently for about a year now, and let me tell you, I got results!  Using this DVD along with a few others from Jillian Michaels and changing my diet I have lost 36 pounds and only have 15 more to go!  I started changing my diet in Feb 2010 and knew that to really lose weight and change my life I would have to add some exercise.  I purchased this DVD based on a friend's recommendation and after just a few weeks I started seeing serious changes in my body.  Jillian's system of 3 minutes of strength training, 2 minutes of cardio, and 1 minute of abs gives you a high intensity workout that never gets boring in only 20 minutes!  Just 20 minutes and you'll feel like you spent an hour at the gym!  Jillian kicked my weight loss into high gear and now I can actually see muscles forming and toning in ways I never have before.  I used to spend hours on the treadmill and elliptical machines and never really saw much of a difference.  With this DVD I saw results fast, and almost a year later I still use this DVD at least once per week and I'm in the best shape of my life!  I'm already down to a healthy weight and only 15 pounds away from my ultimate goal!  Jillian, I owe you!      One more thing, I've had other workout DVDs in the past, and I can't stand how the trainer is all sunshine and roses and smiling the whole time.  I like Jillian's down to earth attitude that working out is challenging and not a whole lot of fun at times, but the results make it all worth it.  Finally, someone real to tell it like it is!  Again, thank you thank you thank you Jillian!    I also highly recommend her \\"Boost Metabolism\\" and \\"No More Trouble Zones\\" DVDs!
0312370849|4.0|This book has been described as haunting and I couldn't agree more.  It leaves you thinking about it well after you have finished reading it. This is actually two stories, one set in 1942 Paris with Sarah and her Jewish family and then the present about a woman who is going to move into an apartment that was inhabited by Sarah, her mom, dad and brother.  The history of the \\"round up\\" of the Jews in 1942 Paris is heartbreaking, but compels you to do a little research on your own.  The modern day Julia, who is obsessed with finding out what happened to Sarah is interesting. But I think what makes this a best seller is Sarah's story.  I would recommend this book.  Sarah is a fictional character, the history of what happened is not.  It cuts to your soul.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|i love this book.when i first started reading it i really did not understand it.but after a couple of chapters i LOVED it. i was dissappointed when it ended.
B000OT6UZQ|5.0|The characters really come alive in this one, and the casting is terrific.  \\"Buffy\\" sure shows a different side of herself, and Ryan Phillippe plays the role of Sebastian well.  It has a little bit of everything!
B003Y5H51K|5.0|I really liked this movie   I like the suspense of what is going to happen   Next. I like the underwater work they had to do for this   Movie . I felt bad at the end of the movie where the son   Had to put his dad out of his misery.  It was a shame that only one person survived at the end of   The movie, I enjoyed this movie as much as I   Liked the Abyss   Terry

159562015X|1.0|The book is not really a book but, a detailed manual for a career fitness exam developed by the author. New book will provide you a code to take the online exam (if you buy used, you cannot re-use the code). The book simply lists various adjectives for skills. If you are interesting the author's career fitness exam, skip the book and take online test directly.
1594202842|5.0|A few observations:    1) this book is about intimacy where a mother and two daughters share much of their afterschool time together.    2) most families have a member who resorts to extreme language to express their passion; Ms. Chua had nowhere to go but to use ever more emotionally charged words.  The alternative would be to stop, something she is not able to do.    3) the children know no other family so they love their mother regardless.  Perhaps when they are parents themselves, other emotions will surface from their childhood.    4) there is a sadness about where it all stops: being the best in one's class? school? town? state? country ? world-wide ethnic group ? world ?  This should sound a bit absurd at some point, so an exit strategy is needed and missing from the book and this parenting philosophy.    5) the comparison to Americans is very modern.  Thirty years ago, I came from a prep school, yacht club, two country club, three eating club world and I can tell you that the pressure to excel was equally strong.  One's peer group will abuse you until you know every word everyone else knows and pronounce it correctly; read every book the group read and understand any connection to your position in the world.    Everything was a competition and every social event was a comparison of accomplishments.  Within  the class I came from, If you excel on the football field, I guarantee you that you will excel in law school and in the practice of law.  The competition factor only increases with the need to reaffirm one's dominance.  Ms. Chua's book is factual and primarily observational.  There is little humor or style.  Her children, I expect are very funny when talking about her.  I also expect she doesn't mind a bit.  My world would attempt such a book with more style and a few laughs here and there.    6) I reject the growth argument and the journey argument.  The youngest child simply said enough and that was it.    7) there is an honesty about the book; and sprinkled self-deprecation among the self-adulation.    I recommend this book, especially for teens entering high school and realizing that college is just around the corner.  I was not offended by anything she wrote, but I can't get my dog to do anything I want either.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|Hugh Grant and his narrative are hilarious and you can't help but adore the boy who plays Marcus. You can so relate to his discomfort with life at school and with a single parent, with a disconnected birth father who needs a man to mentor him through life. The unlikely choice of the Hugh Grant character, lends to the humor and it's great to see Marcus begin to change the Will character, by forcing him out of his \\"Island\\" and connect him to real people, and his ultimate realization that he is \\"needed\\" by someone and therefore has a purpose in life and is not, after all, \\"blank.\\" It's a wonderful \\"coming of age\\" story which is good to watch with a tweener or a teen. The language and innuendo are only slightly crude are very scarce.

1416583432|1.0|Got this book for xmas and could not wait to read it. I love dogs and looked forward to learning more about them. This book was a HUGE disappointment. It has a great cover and cute drawings inside but it is dull, duller, dullest read in a long time. I may convince some people not to get a dog!    The author knows her science but not how to write an engaging book. It is way too technical for most people. It would be good for first year vet students. I gave up halfway thru after several nights of trying to fight through it. No way to end the day, folks. It just made my hair hurt.    If you want to know more about dogs, take yours for a long walk. Or read Merle's Door by Ted Kerasote. Better yet, rent The Dog Wisperer with Caesar Millan. You will learn more about your dog in a few episodes of this great show than wrestling with the pages of Inside of a dog. You'll thank me!

B004EBUXSA|5.0|During my most recent build I upgraded from a Q6600 -- which was a good chip back in its day. This chip SCREAMS, however.<br /><br />I have it overclocked to 4.5 Ghz on ASUS P8P67 PRO motherboard with 8 gigs of G Skill ripjaws ram using the Asus AI Suite.  Windows Experience Index gives this a score of 7.8 in my system.  Passmark Software CPU Benchmark (google them) ranks this processor the 7th best performing CPU, in the following order (it was Number 3 when I bought it):<br /><br />Intel Core i7 990X @ 3.47GHz cpu mark:  10,917  NA<br />Intel Core i7 995X @ 3.60GHz cpu mark:  10,795  NA<br />Intel Core i7 980X @ 3.33GHz cpu mark:  10,482  $999.99*<br />Intel Core i7 970 @ 3.20GHz cpu mark:  9,925  $899.99**<br />Intel Xeon X5680 @ 3.33GHz cpu mark:  9,721  $1,676.49*<br />Intel Xeon W3680 @ 3.33GHz cpu mark:  9,655  $1,127.12*<br />Intel Xeon X5675 @ 3.07GHz cpu mark:  9,326  NA<br />Intel Core i7-2600K @ 3.40GHz cpu mark:  9,291  $329.99**<br /><br />Note that three of the CPU's that have better performance scores are NOT commercially available at the current time, and the remaining three processors are three to five times the price of this one. The closest desktop AMD processor is the AMD Phenom II X6 1100T, which has cpu mark scores only in the 6000 range.  Passmark also has a price-to-performance chart that rates your best bang for the buck, though many of the highest scoring processors on that chart are simply much slower and much cheaper.<br /><br />I am very happy with this:  it overclocks extremely well and stays very cool.  It runs all my programs with blazing speed, including BFBC2 with all settings on high.  At 4.5 Ghz and full load, it doesn't go over 38 degrees Celsius.<br /><br />Get it at this price while they're still available.  Highly recommended.

B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I dont really care what critics say.  This Movie is so much fun and beautifully done it is a hit in my book.  I am a big fan of all musicals and this one is one of the best.  I have seen it again on TV recently and was signing and dancing my butt off.  Have fun buy this movie.  You will not be sorry!
4770031246|5.0|The book is very colorful with photos of delicious bento meals.  I don't need to pack a lunch anymore, but I've tried many of the recipes already and found them to be delicious.  The directions are easy to follow. The time lines for morning preps are a nice feature.  It's a great cookbook for foods that will keep without refrigeration, which is sometimes necessary.  It also has tips for freezing those dishes that make multiple servings.  Numerous photos show the \\"how-to\\" steps for things that may be a new technique for many.  And I like the explanations for the names for some of the uncommon Japanese dishes.  Unlike most cookbooks, these are whole meals, all planned out for you.  The attractive photos just make you want to cook up these meals.    I like that the recipes are for 1-2 servings.  Sometimes I'll double a recipe if I want more. It's ideal for my mom who lives alone now.
B002ZG999U|3.0|This is not a great film with great acting.    However, because of that (or maybe in spite of), it's enjoyable.    Just don't expect too much.    The cameos are great - The Governator looks a bit peakish.
B002NEFL8W|5.0|Prior to owning the Canon 7d, I owned a Nikon D90.  I purchased a Zeikos grip for my D90.  Even though the Zeikos grip performed its task, it never seemed to \\"fit\\" or \\"look\\" right when attached to the body.    I purchased the Canon 7d this past September and figured I'd get the Zeikos grip for it.  However, after spending much time researching reviews, I decided to get the Canon BG-E7 Battery Grip over the Zeikos...WOW, am I glad that I spent the extra money.  Here are the reasons:    -The grip fits snug into place and is made of the exact materials in the 7d...so cosmetically, it flows naturally!  -Performance is a non-issue.  Shutter button works amazing on the grip.  -Finally, if you invest in the money to buy a 7d, why would u put a 3rd party grip in it running the risk of damaging your investment?    So, if you are on the \\"fence\\" between this and 3rd party grips, do yourself a big favor and buy the \\"branded\\" copy.  Yes it cost more, but you do get what you pay for.  Hope this helps and happy shooting!
B001TOD92C|5.0|Astounding. Watch it. Don't listen to the negative reviews. If you have a soul and an eye for beautiful cinematography and a moving story, this movie is amazing.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I wanted a little extra organization for my lightweight stroller (peg perego aria - 10lbs and works like a full size)...however, PP makes crappy cup holders - they're small and cracks.<br /><br />I wanted to get an organizer that was closer to the handles so i can throw my cell/bottle and keys in - without having to fumble around my diaper bag or a purse. This works!<br /><br />I have a u shaped handle - full bar (like the photo) - it secures tightly and with little wobble with beverages - I still would NOT recommend putting a beverage w/o a lid as that's asking for an accident! The little zippered pouch is great for keys and maybe some cash. This doesn't get in the way of my stroller's recline or when it's folded up.<br /><br />Very happy!! I finally found something that works well with my stroller.
B002ZG980U|5.0|One of the most original movies (that was good) I have seen in a long time. No re-boot, sequel, pre-quel,alternate story, or crappy re-make here! Great story, acting, directing, and the score was almost like a character in the movie! Only thing is you HAVE to pay attention, and may want to watch it a couple times.

031603438X|5.0|As a guitarist marching through Keith Richards' 500 page autobiographic tome I was fascinated by his description of the growth and development of his music.  I knew the Stones were innovative but Richards' book explains in detail his creative process and the direction of his musical evolution.<br />I'm not sure how long he took to write the book but it seems that his style changed somewhere near the middle; from hip flippant to more structured insight.<br />I only began the book as it was recommended by the lead guitarist of our university R&R band, The Rockingham Whigs.  Music is important in life but where as Richards lives it intensely, I simply enjoy it.<br />Perhaps because of my own prickly experimentation with recreational drugs as a youth and band member, I cringed reading his delve into narcotics.  Too blunt or too close to home?<br />Keith Richards lives for his music and the world is richer for it.  Highly recommended for all musicians literal or otherwise.
1405734523|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo9HDU8I2X2T68]]THE LATEST EDITION OF CARTER-RUCK ON LIBEL AND PRIVACY<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />A new edition of this formidable title from LexisNexis in the Butterworths Common Law Series has appeared since the last edition was published in 1997. Indeed, it's the first new edition since the death of its original author, Peter Carter-Ruck -- minus the style, tone and occasional idiosyncracies that characterized his approach.<br /><br />The title is new too, having been changed (so we note from the authors' preface), from Carter-Ruck on Libel and Slander to the more apt and apposite Carter-Ruck on Libel and Privacy, because of significant changes in the law over the past 13 years, the chapters on libel and slander have been completely re-written.  And what changes!  Consider the changes in social mores that have taken place during this turbulent period: certainly the revolution wrought by the internet and the resulting phenomenon of social networking, cannot fail to have had an impact on the law pertaining to privacy, libel and of course, the frequent controversies surrounding free speech.<br /><br />Inevitably, substantial changes in the law have occurred since 1997 - some by legislation; others by the development of the common law by the courts. In the words of the authors, the book deals primarily with `the way in which the law provides protection to reputation through the torts of libel and slander and to privacy though the claim for misuse of private information.'<br /><br />The book is logically divided into four parts.  The first three are concerned with the relevant law of England and Wales. The final part, (containing separate chapters written by a worldwide team of learned contributors) deals with defamation and privacy laws across a range of more than 75 jurisdictions, from Argentina and Austria to the Ukraine and USA.  In compiling, editing and re-writing this volume, the authors have succeeded admirably in their stated aim of providing `a complete and balanced treatment of the law and practice of defamation, privacy and related claims, both in England and Wales and...other jurisdictions.'<br /><br />The global reach and outlook which forms the backdrop to this comprehensive and learned work will make it a must-have addition to the law libraries of specialists in this complex, fast-moving area of law, particularly those with international clients.  General practitioners too, will find this work of reference invaluable.<br /><br />Included in the book's 1,800 erudite pages and 55 highly detailed chapters, are the expected research tools: three appendices (to include `statutory materials'...'libel and slander awards schedule'...and `privacy awards schedule') plus extensive tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments and useful index.<br /><br />The law is stated as at November 2010 with a completely re-written text after well over a decade of turbulent libel years culminating in today's difficult internet climate- the next edition will be an even more massive challenge for Butterworths to undertake, as the face of libel and privacy changes forever with modern technology, so thank you for this excellent new title in the Common Law Series.bly in their stated aim of providing `a complete and balanced treatment of the law and practice of defamation, privacy and related claims, both in England and Wales and...other jurisdictions.'

B004DK5CW4|1.0|Riva Ridge already saved the farm one year before Secretariat accomplished anything.  Lucien Laurin couldn't have felt too much like a loser since he trained the champion before Secretariat won a Triple Crown race.  The underlying story is bull.  Anyone who doesn't care about the accuracy of history or telling a \\"true\\" true story should definitely see this hokey movie.  But if you want some level of truth then this is not the place to go for it.  No surprise that it is so religiously influenced.  Nobody knows better how to spin a story like a catholic or how not to care about the truth.    By the way, the coin toss story in this movie.  All wrong.  The Wood Memorial?  Sham did not win, Secretariat's stable mate did.(Angle Light)  What was the crowd so mad about?  If they bet on Secretariat they still cashed.  Angle Light and Secretariat were an entry.  Paul Feliciano was not fired after Secretariat lost his first race. Feliciano was on him eleven days later when he broke his maiden.  This is just some of the nonsense in this movie.  What a disgrace.
B004D7GU3C|5.0|Once again, just like I expected, Ricky Martin comes back with an AMAZING CD. The sound quality is at it's BEST!(as always). The lyrics reflect and express all that he feels inside. He's an outstanding human being and of course, a PROFESSIONAL !!
0670022411|2.0|This is romantic urban fantasy in disguise for the people who run away from sff with all the paraphernalia; or maybe in another analogy, it is Twilight for the middle-age group not for the teens; anyway a very light, mostly predictable and boring novel which was worth a fast read from me just because based on advanced word of mouth I expected an interesting book; this one definitely does not qualify having any and all cliches expected from both the UF field, the romance field and the \\"beautiful people\\" lit (eg Harvard, Oxford, moneyed + brains + looks field)    The one upside is that the book is written in a light humorous first person tone that doesn't take itself too seriously, so the teeth grinding from junk like The Historian is missing here and I do not feel i wasted the hour I went through this one.    One thing that is puzzling to me is why the buzz since this book has nothing myriad others do not have either; the Gail Carriger novels, unabashed UF and however much I found the first not for me and they have similar stuff in a far more interesting set-up that does not rehash Templars, conspiracies and the whole Ivy League/Oxbridge non-sense...
B000F9RB8K|4.0|My wife and I watched this new Blu-ray release last night and we both agreed that it looked and sounded great. It seems that whatever short-comings this title may have lay with the film master. One trivia point is that the filming location suffered through a rainy season when normally it's not. This tended to produce many mostly cloudy scenes which added a drab look to much of the movie along with the intended brown and gray palette, although there are several scenes where the cinematography is spectacular justifies the Oscar win for John Tull. Some scenes especially close-ups looked very detailed while others appeared softer. I've owned this title on laserdisc and DVD but without a doubt the picture and sound (DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1) on this version is the best. I won't bother with the storyline, if you're reading this you're probably a fan already. Recommended buy.
B004BBDHEK|5.0|I really enjoyed listening to the cd! I know people were expecting the cd to sound like his old music, but I really liked that it was different. The only complaint I had was it sounded a bit to \\"electronic\\" and not \\"live sounding\\" like it used to in the past...I didn't hear as much of Yanni playing the piano as he did a lot on his past cds.. but, overall I was so excited he came out with an instrumental cd again! I personally like his classic style (without voice but just instrumental the best but I do think that they are amazing singers)    Anyway, thank you Yanni for creating this cd! I loved your music since I was very young and still love it til this day! You are absolutely amazing and talented and I hope to see more instrumental cds in the future! =)    I definitely rate this cd overall a 5! I personally really enjoyed it!!!! Amazing! I recommend this cd! =) and it grows on you!!=) #1 is my favorite song and I love song number 12 on the cd too! =)    ps. I wish he had more songs that sounded like his song in the past called \\"Nostalgia\\"..If you never heard of it, I recommend going to youtube to hear it... ID love to see more of that again!!!!! I am sure many of you would! =)
B001OQCV2E|3.0|This film is the oddest mix of comedy and melodrama, all against the backdrop of the end of the world with the most spectacular computer-generated effects.  It's definately fun to watch - our whole family laughed and commented our way through it - but after a while it is too over the top to suspend your disbelief.  In a way, it views like a James Cameron wannabee production, just without as much imagination.  Sure, it's endearing, there are lots of genuinely wonderful performances (my favorite was Woody Harrelson as a nut case broadcaster who wanted to describe the end first), and it's a all's-well-that-ends-well conclusion (including a divorced couple re-finding eachother), but the sentimentalism is too much.<br /><br />REcommended as quite good throwaway entertainment.
030726999X|5.0|Amazon certainly was an each process from which to order.  The book was delivered in a very timely manner.<br /><br />I enjoyed the trilogy.  It is very sad Stieg is no longer with us.  His writing was terrific.
B0041T4ML4|4.0|I'm writing this from a different perspective than I usually might, which is that I'm only about a quarter of the way through this book.  Normally I wouldn't express an opinion of a book that I hadn't already finished, but I think I have a useful enough impression to give my opinion.<br /><br />Overall, I'm really impressed by the way Bacigalupi handles exposition and the depth of the characters is impressive.  It's a real page-turner, with a frighteningly plausible setting in a sort of post-apocalyptic Earth where agricultural blight and famine have lead to vast power shifts in a world where exhausted fossil fuels have been replaced with low-tech alternatives, and establishing a rather isolated global view.  The depiction of racial and class strife at many different levels, from a beloved government official down to Emiko, the titular Windup Girl, is powerful and moving.<br /><br />If I have one gripe (and it's a BIG one), it's the incessant and pretentious use of Thai words and phrases throughout the novel.  It strikes me as a kind of overbearing gimmick, like English actors in an American movie speaking with a phony Russian accent, in order to make you believe that they're speaking Russian without having to make you read subtitles (or make the actors learn to speak passable Russian).  In the end, I feel like every paragraph is brow-beating me with the notion that Bacigalupi is somehow superior because he has used some clever foreign words.  It's definitely a literary gadget that is thoroughly played out after a chapter or two.  The Kindle version contains a glossary, but it only includes seven terms, all of which are the most easily understood and better-explained words, which makes it pretty well useless.<br /><br />Still in all, I look forward to finishing the rest of this book, and I will likely try another of his novels, perhaps Ship Breaker.
0425170349|4.0|Tom Clancy's \\"Rainbow Six\\" is a fun action-filled novel that follows the characters who make up a newly formed international counter-terror organization called Rainbow. There's plenty of character development throughout the book which focuses mainly on Rainbow leader John Clark, one of his lead soldiers Domingo \\"Ding\\" Chavez, a former KGB agent named Popov, and Popov's employers who lead a secret nature-saving organization known as \\"The Project.\\" Clancy does a great job articulating the plot in this long story. He doesn't give away too much information too early; only a little bit at a time keeping his readers guessing until the story nears its climax.    The Rainbow group embarks on quite a few counter-terror missions which, to their surprise, all occur within a rather short period of time. These missions, as well as the story's opening scene, are real entertaining to read because of the great way Clancy handles the action and suspense, and it makes this book feel a lot shorter than 900 pages. However, some of the chapters between these events progress too slowly, mainly because of the excessive detail Clancy sometimes uses in his narration when describing what certain characters are doing or thinking or feeling and when describing some of the weapons and technology being used. Those chapters made the book feel like it was at least 900 pages long.    There were times when the dialogue was rather stilted and there was also a plot element at the very end of the story that seemed a little absurd to me, but overall \\"Rainbow Six\\" is a fun book to read. I was hesitant at first to read it because of its length, but I ended up really enjoying it for the most part. It's not perfect, but there's some solid character development that enhances the story, and there's also a lot of action and suspense that makes it a quality page-turner.
0486476421|4.0|The article is good. The price was good. Only the delivery took  a while, but amazon informed accordingly. So the overall   evaluation is very good.
0670022411|5.0|From the beginning, I could not put this book down.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and am eagerly awaiting the next installment!
0307454541|1.0|The first several hundred pages were an absolute bore.  Then it switched to very horrific material.  If you enjoy reading page after page after page of incest, rape, torture & murder, this is the book for you.  The solution was nothing clever, new or interesting, just morbid beyond belief.  I deeply regret the hours of my life I wasted on this book.
0143117564|1.0|While this may make a decent movie (which is rumored to be in production), it's a terrible novel. It's like a novelization of the Big Lebowski where every detail is described in a painfully boring manner. There is no meter to the writing so it's a slow read and practically nothing that occurs is important to move the plot along. Perhaps if you lived in L.A. during the late 60's/early 70's, this book would be interesting, but for everyone else it offers nothing. In every chapter the protagonist goes through the same routine: he smokes a joint and stumbles across a clue that leads him to the next chapter. It glorifies hippies and condemns the right-wing Man, but by doing this it really just does a disservice to liberals by portraying them as a bunch of negative stereotypes. This is one of the only books I've read that I dreaded picking up because not only was it pointless, but it also had no entertainment value. None of the characters seemed to matter, and they were all described in such lavish detail it was never apparent whether they would play a major role or not. Pynchon would spend a page or two describing a character and then never bring them up again. It was impossible to remember them all, impossible to remember what mattered about them.    I usually don't write reviews but I felt obligated to warn people to stay away from this one. This book shouldn't have been published.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|If you are a fan of the earlier Black Keys albums and didn't like \\"Attack and Release\\", then chances are you won't like this one, either. Having said that, I have to say that they have come a long way since the release of their first album \\"The Big Come Up\\" in 2002, and this is their best release, yet. True, it's not as high-energy as the earlier releases, but I think the guys have shown how much they've matured, musically.     There is much more R&B and soul-influenced material on this album. It shows a deeper, more soulful, side of the band, in my opinion, and I like it. You could close your eyes and swear it was 1972, yet the music sounds fresh. They channel all of the funkiness of early '70's funk, soul, blues and R&B without sounding dated. How they can sound old, yet sound new at the same time, is beyond me! It's not as stripped-down and raw as the earlier albums, but it still has that funky, dirty, dark sound that you'd expect to hear on a Black Keys album. Growing up in cold, economically-depressed Akron, Ohio had something to do with that, no doubt.     Glad to see that these guys are still going strong, and I'm proud to say that they're from my home state of Ohio!
1594202842|2.0|Battle Hymn of the Chinese Mother is Amy Chua's memoir about being a super-strict \\"Chinese\\" mom (Chua equates \\"Chinese\\" with super-strict even though this is a stretch in my opinion). Having been raised in a strict Chinese household and having a high-achieving life as a Yale Law Professor, she is determined to produce similarly high-achieving children. She chooses classical music performance as her main method for this. Her older daughter Sophia accepts her parenting (mostly) and wins piano competitions. Her younger daughter Lulu rebels and eventually quits the violin after a humiliating public argument where Lulu screams \\"I HATE my life. I HATE you, and I HATE this family!\\"    On the positive side, the memoir is entertaining, honestly written, and makes you think about parenting. On the negative side, Chua just seems oblivious about the effects about the downsides of the super-strict parenting style. She acknowledges that she isn't good at enjoying life, is socially awkward, and pursued a career in law even though she didn't like it. Is that how she wants her children to turn out? Ultimately, it seems like her attempt to create musical prodigies is driven more by her pursuit of her own unfulfilled dreams rather than to help her kids. She rationalizes it by saying that it'll help them get into Ivy League schools, but even that seems questionable, since her kids would be better off playing less popular instruments than piano and violin if that was the motivation.    Moreover, she herself isn't as obedient as a product of the \\"Chinese\\" style should be: she marries a white guy instead of a Chinese guy, against her parents' wishes, and doesn't go to Berkeley, her parents' preferred school. Yeah, going to Harvard isn't a huge rebellion but it probably did cost her parents a lot more money. Furthermore, her parents clearly weren't as strict as she is trying to be, since they evidently let her quit the piano herself. Her dad even suggests that she switches majors from mathematics, which doesn't sound characteristic of a \\"Chinese\\" dad as she defines it. Her mom tells her to ease off on Lulu. Meanwhile, her husband is just as high-achieving as her (perhaps more), yet was raised in a liberal environment. He also seems to enjoy his life more and to just generally be saner.    In the end, she sees the writing on the wall and accepts her daughter quitting violin. But has she really learned anything?
044654759X|5.0|Last night I finished the audio version of \\"Safe Haven,\\" and must say that I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The story kept me interested and the female narrator was very good at characterization.  I really like Nicholas Sparks' writing style and the way he conveys to the reader what the characters are thinking and feeling and why they are motivated to do what they do. He sets up the scene for the reader to the smallest detail.  I had no idea how this book was going to end and it didn't disappoint -- I loved it.  This is my 2nd Nicholas Sparks book (\\"Nights in Rodanthe\\" was the first) and it certainly won't be my last.  I can't wait for the movie of this one.  Now I'm off to begin the audio version of Nicholas Sparks' \\"The Choice.\\"  Hopefully, it will be just as good.
B0045QE3GM|5.0|It's so good to once again hear the Bryan Ferry of Bete Noire/Mamouna/Boys And Girls fame.   Ferry is back to his roots, with the multi-layed haunting melodic songs that made him pretty famous.    This is just outstanding material, and appreciated the more one hears it. May I recommend listening to it with a good pair of headphones, to really get into all the great musicianship that goes with these songs.  Of course, that's nothing new for Ferry, who has always surrounded himself with great musicians.    If you liked those \\"old CDs\\" mentioned above, you should like this, too!  By the way, the MP 3 album priced at $5.99 is a complete steal.
1931788340|4.0|Stephen Shore grew up in downtown New York. One day, he and a friend decided to drive to Amarillo, Texas and get out of the big city for a spell. Uncommon Places is a result of that trip. Although I'm not a huge fan of landscape photography, I enjoyed viewing what Shore thought was \\"uncommon\\" (the name of his book), as I grew up in rural and smalltown America and found many of the photos \\"commonplace.\\" That is no disrespect to the artist, however. I find him incredibly compelling as an artist and a person.<br />What I find intriguing is that Shore reconnects one with those images from their past and also invites the viewer to see their smalltown landscape from a new, invigorating lens. The photos of small towns, diners, beaches, and movie theatres brought me to a place where I wondered \\"What is Common?\\" \\"What is Uncommon?\\" To Stephen, that would be my reality. He would find me and my reality, uncommon. Wow. Never considered that before. I, no doubt, would find his the same.<br />Shore is famous for winning critical acclaim when he was twenty-three, photographing Andy Warhol's Factory, the temple of underground art in the sixties.<br />Uncommon Places is a selection of forty-nine photographs taken between 1973 and 1981.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Loved the book but the typos on the Kindle version were annoying.  Really did no one check it?  I can understand that maybe a space doesn't get added between all words but really this is a novel not a tirm paper.  I have both the books and the Kindle version.  Wish the corrections could be made and and email sent about the corrections.
B0033B5XCS|4.0|So for all you horror buffs who cant get enough blood and guts and death death die! (red dragons) .. Nightmare on elm street isnt all kill kill the end.. freddy is a witty mofo at times and personally had some of the more creative deaths in his films.. at times the people in the film you wish he'd kill sooner but ahh what are you gonna do :\ .. this was a gift and to get the boxset is a way better idea then one by one by one.. you get the set and have a movie marathon if you can.. >>I think actually its cheaper at that as well.. (7-10 bucks a single movie) it comes in a nice case and was packaged very sterdy cardboard for protection..
B00479SVBU|5.0|Bought this product for my wives Hummer H3. Followed directions, plugged in her iTouch and this product performs flawlessly. It took literally a min to adjust the audio settings. (Songs that have alot of bass sound bad right out of the box so you have to adjust it accordingly to how you like it). Found the right radio station and I she gets no static when driving around town (San Angelo, Texas). If you closed your eyes you wouldn't tell it was being broadcast through this little device.<br /><br />On the rare occasion drive her truck I hook up my Samsung Vibrant Galaxy S phone so I can hear my songs and it works perfectly with that as well. Def worth the money and so glad I got it. Def recommend if your sound system doesn't have an audio jack or an ipod connection this will def work for you.
B001U6YI92|5.0|Thinking about picking this up but unsure?? .. worry not.. the good the bad and the ugly is one of the BEST,  and CLASSIC westerns of its time.. getting it on blueray almost makes it seem as if it was filmed recently.. okay maybe not that good but close to it.. :p  for those complaining about the sounds being off, it was like that on the vhs, just how it was filmed.. hence why its a spazghetti western. focus. over-all anyone into well acted and quality westerns pick this up.. this was a gift for my dad as he is a huge fan, and got me into the man with no name movies (theres 3 movies) as a kid.. also the packing was excellent came in a thick&lt; cardboard case..
B001L1S1SK|5.0|I never watched Ugly Betty when it was on TV. A friend loves the show, so I bought season 1 & 2 as a X-mas gift. We watched the first 2 episodes and I was hooked.<br />I then bought season 3, then 4.<br />Item arrives new and quick...thanks!!...Brian
B0015DROBO|2.0|I started reading this book because it was on the bestseller list. It started out slow. Then it started getting interesting, but it had too many subplots. It also had so many little details that it was hard to keep it all straight. The overall story could have been better. In the end it was a bit boring and disappointing!

0425188809|4.0|This book is good because of the way Dean Koontz combines his love of his dog with the unique idea of transgenetic combinations.  Also the explanation of the title was a surprise; not scary, as I expected, but touching and philosophical.
B001F12J0C|2.0|I am certain that almost 50% of all three segments were violent car chases/collisions....it just goes on and on.  Matt Damon deserved a better base for his outstanding talent.  This was a big disappointment  I was, of course, familiar with the plot and expected a really fine production.  Viewing this trilogy again will take a really cold day!
B000G759LW|5.0|Probably the best thing about this album is, that it is a fantastic program from A to Z. With one exception: the \\"Thank you\\" song is actually made of thanks of the Christina's fans addressed to her. Far below class of such artist. Other than which, the \\"Back to Basics\\" can only be spoken of in superlatives. Even seen from the perspective of a few years, as I write my review in early 2011, it is certainly her best album so far. It is one of this very few CDs, which are defining popular music, and it seems very well thought through. Think of it, as if the artist wanted to sing a lesson about what her style, and its heritage is. And then, it is a magnificent lesson in singing as well. Personally I am hardly found of hip-hop / soul / etc. kind, but Christina's voice made all the difference. Is it just me, or is she actually the most able singer in the planet whatever the genre? Yeah, her voice is addictive.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I am enjoying this cd very much. Susan Boyle is an amazing singer and hope she will put out a vidio dvd.
1453767533|2.0|For the first fifteen years of her life, Catherine is nothing very special...  She isn't pretty or highly accepted by society.  But when she grows older, her parents finally see hope in Catherine's future, and let her go to Bath with their family friends the Allens.  While there, Catherine reads a great deal of romantic, adventurous, and horrific novels, and discusses them with her new-found friend, Isabella Thorpe.  When she meets Henry Tilney, Catherine quickly falls in love with him.  And when he and his sister ask Catherine to visit their home, Northanger Abbey, Catherine's fantasies (because of the novels she reads) quickly alarm her.  What is really going on behind the Abbey walls?<br /><br />______________________________________________<br /><br />That synopsis is not what this book is about.  I had to write something, but this is not a correct representation of the book.  It's what you'll read all over the place when you inquire about Northanger Abbey`s contents.  Unfortunately, it's not the whole truth.  Yes, the book contains some of this.  Catherine does go to Bath with the Allens, she does fall in love with Henry, and she does begin to question the happenings of the Abbey and the Tilney family.  But would you like to know about how much of the book this takes up?  Maybe half.  And the mystery itself is only a quarter of the story.<br /><br />I'm so disappointed.  I was expecting, by the description on the back of my Barnes and Noble copy (and everything else I'd read about it), that this would be a gothic novel full of mysteries and enchanting (or not so enchanting) secrets.  Not so.  The first \\"Volume\\" was consisted of their time in Bath, Catherine and Isabella's friendship, and possible suitors (other than Henry) for both of them.  Henry is introduced but not much happens between him and Catherine until a bit later.<br /><br />Catherine, Henry, and Isabella were developed well, as were Mr. Thorpe, Isabella's brother, and Eleanor Tilney, Henry's sister.  Catherine and Henry were absolutely adorable together, honestly.  I could totally picture them together.  I guess character development is not the issue here.  Execution of story and too much fluff are, however.  There was so much that happened in the book that I totally could have skipped over and I still would have understood the story perfectly.  I honestly didn't feel that there was much point to this book, except to lengthen the time in which Catherine and Henry fall in love.<br /><br />Favorite character:  Henry, definitely.<br /><br />Favorite aspect:  Henry's interactions with everyone he knew, especially his sister and Catherine.  I also liked his brother's part in the story, but I won't spoil that for you if you want to read it.<br /><br />Summed up with one word: pointless...  Sorry, all you Northanger Abbey fans.  It just didn't do it for me. :/lutely adorable together, honestly.  I could totally picture them together.  I guess character development is not the issue here.

B0013USZHG|5.0|The Simon Bolivar Orchestra from Venezuela  conducted by Gustavo Dudamel (now with the LA Symphony Orchestra) is a wonder and a delight at the same time.  Chosen from the youth musicians of Venezuela this symphony is one of the best classical affirming orchestras of the 2000's.  I first saw them on YouTube at a performance in England and it has taken a couple of years to find and buy Fiesta. It is unusual to find a symphony that plays with emotion and desire unlike many of the *best* and *well known* orchestras who many times just phone the performance in.  Their enthusiasm is impossible to hide as they play this CD of Latin music and beats.  The performances of Revueltas' Sensemaya, Marquez' Danzon No.2 and Cinestera's Dances from Estancia opus 8 are examples of how well this orchestra plays.  For pure fun the live performance of Mambo will have you wanting to jump from your chairs and dance.  Buy it and enjoy great music.
B004BBDHEK|5.0|First of all - I wouldn't say this is precisely Yanni as you know him, for this is definitely not the the Yanni from the 90's.  Since Ethnicity, Yanni has explored new paths and in a sense grow.  I can't say that I liked all of his recent productions, \\"Voices\\" was an OK album and \\"Mexicanisimo\\" was a terrible abomination - do not buy that album!  Truth of Touch on the other hand is really refreshing - it really is.  It has very well thought rhythms and melodies, it has a very unique and new sound to it - I believe it is a great transition for a new totally amazing Yanni to come in the next album.  As far as the songs, Truth of Touch, Seasons, Voyage, Guilty Pleasure and Nine are my favorites.  They also have some voices music which is ok and not overwhelming and a few other songs like \\"I'm So\\" and \\"Yanni & Arturo\\" which are terrific.      If you want to know more or less what this style is, I would compare to \\"If I could tell you\\" with a little bit of more rhythms and electronic sounds - but the album is really completely new, I totally like it and honestly:    YOU OUGHT TO BUY THIS ALBUM AND SEE HIM LIVE!     The ambiance of the album is just great, you can lay down in bed and listen to seasons, for example, and totally relax and imagine great things.  This album is overall happy and energetic, it puts me in a very good mood.  I also use it on the background to do homework.         I must say that you shouldn't expect LATA or Tribute at all - take it on its own terms, the album is great.  GIVE IT A SHOT   WORTH IT!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I started watching the first episode of the series around 11:00 one night. I figured I'd watch an hour then go to bed, spreading the rest of the series out over the next few days... I was wrong. Almost four hours later I was still curled up on the sofa and quietly cursing the fact that the series was at an end. I think I thought about replaying it all right then and there! The casting in this movie is beyond superb. Daniela and Sinead shine... the real star though is Richard Armitage. This was the first I had ever seen of the actor and he was perfection personified in this role. I am not easily wowed by actors but Richards incredibly passionate performance in North & South was truly inspired. Beautifully filmed and eerily atmospheric, the mood of the picture is bleak and fitting for a story taking place in a northern, industrial English town. Elizabeth Gaskell doesn't hesitate to make a keen social statement with her story, a commentary that runs seamlessly through the romance. Moreover, the soundtrack sets the tone perfectly. This is worthy of more than 5 stars, an instant classic and a movie that you'll want to watch again and again.
B0037SQ3C6|4.0|Yundi Li once again proves he is a master of technical execution when it comes to the classical composition with this double CD of Chopin Nocturnes.  It is material with which he is extremely familiar and comfortable.  His 2002 release, \\"Chopin,\\" covered a wider range of Chopin compositions by offering Sonatas, the Grande Polonaise, Etudes, and Nocturnes.  This time out, for his first album on EMI, he presents Chopin's Complete Nocturnes on solo piano with incredible precision.  The CD is a welcome addition to his already stunning discography.    If a literal interpretation and performance of classical music is not your thing, this CD may fall short on your level of expectations.  Otherwise, give it a shot.  These tracks may be technically precise, but they are never cold.  The renditions are warm, beautiful, and inviting.  Recommended.
B002ZG9774|5.0|I HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE 7 TIMES AND WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT AGAIN RIGHT NOW..  AND SOOOO LOOK FORWARD TO IT COMING OUT ON DVD...IT IS THE MOST WONDERFUL FEEL GOOD MOVIE OF THE LAST 10 YEARS...OMG I AM ADDICTED TO THIS MOVIE...A MUST SEE BY EVERYONE..
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was recommended this book last week by someone who didn't strike me as an avid Sci-Fi reader but nonetheless I tracked it down and decided to download it. This was an excellent decision! Quite honestly this is one of the best books I have read in a very long time and I am now recommending the book to friends and colleagues alike.<br /><br />Like most classics, the book appeals to readers at all levels. Obviously there's the plot itself - complex yet totally absorbing. Then there are the characters - real, flawed and believable. Then there's the message - powerful and relevant. And lastly there's the quality of the writing - simply page turning.<br /><br />I found it hard to believe that the book was written over 15 years ago at a time when most of the small technical gadgets we take for granted today did not yet exist. Much more so than most other books in this genre, Ender's Game paints a completely believable picture of advanced technology, mixed with everyday emotions and traits of human society. If the year today was 2300, maybe this book could even be believed as an historical account of recent times!<br /><br />Anyway, I'm not going to reveal the plot as you can glean that from others, but I will end this review by saying I for one will be purchasing the rest of what looks like being an amazing series of books. If you're not a fan of long series, don't be put off - this book can be read as a one-off. It has a beginning, middle and an end (not a cliff hanger). Just as a real book should have! (Just don't tell anyone that there's more Ender fix available to those that need it.)
B000002KET|5.0|Another superb masterpiece. All the songs are really great and the way that ozzy sings is amazing. You can remember the lyrics .The music is easy - listening heavy metal that can be listened any time. A national acrobat - Sabra cadabra and Sabbath bloody Sabbath are <<the something else>> . Personally i like all the songs. I recommend this album to ALL metal fans.
B004856SQ8|5.0|This being a newer release I expect the image and sound quality to be up there with the best of them and this transfer did not disappoint.<br /><br />I dropped this disc into my Oppo and waited for it to play, it loads pretty quick for a blu, right of the bat you can tell this is going to have a powerful sound track. I could not wait to see how the disc faired against what I saw and heard in the theater when it first came out.<br /><br />Note the dialog is crisp and clear bottom end punch is well defined, your sub will get a workout, and it should in this type of movie.<br /><br />Rear channels are used when they should be and not for no reason.<br /><br />Unlike some blu's I have sampled this is very well balanced, dialog is never to low or muffled against the sound-scape of FX. Cant say that about others Paranah 3D comes to mind in my opin not so great as the sound such as DJ music is blazingly loud and the the dialog is too darn low ... bad mix in my opin plus I hate consumer 3D its a waste. I want top notch image quality not some 3D gimmick, not the case with the A-Team great sound and picture no 3D gimmicks as so many new releases opt for.<br /><br />It is very well mixed in my opin and presents itself as it should for a new release. I feel the image quality is as I said also very good but not quite as high as King Kong. I keep Kong as my ref disc I feel its that good.
B000002KFJ|4.0|Symptom of the Universe is the best song in this album. This album has some enough good songs and is the last very good album with Ozzy. From then Black Sabbath are not as good as before. I recommend this album to all Black Sabbath fans and to people who want to hear metal that is very easy - listening.
0439023521|5.0|I know this book has been reviewed a gazillion times since its first publication in 2008.  I always seem to be late to the party when it comes to reading the books rated the highest.  I usually do not read Young Adult books unless my daughter prods me with one that she especially loves.  This time I have beat her to the job and now I'm pestering her to make it the first read she chooses when her school work lets up a bit.<br /><br />If you haven't read this book, I must ask you what are you waiting for?  The first couple of chapters set the groundwork for understanding the setup of this new world as well as its social structure.  From the moment they are released into the game it is nonstop action.  I just could not put it down.  The main character, Katniss, is quite a girl and unlike the majority of what you would find in a 16 year old girl.  Considering the environment she lives in and the role of parenting sprung on her at a young age it is no wonder she is wise beyond her years.<br /><br />Movie rights were purchased by Lionsgate and it is scheduled for production in 2011.  I can easily see this book turning into an excellent movie.  No cast has been revealed as of yet as far as I can find.<br /><br />For those of you who have read the book, who do you think would play a good Katniss?  What about Peeta - who do you see him in the role of?  For those of you who haven't read it yet - I suggest you check it out.
B000002KIK|2.0|Only Never say die and Juniors eyes worth a good rate. The other songs are really terrible. One of their worst albums in their entire career. Thaks God Ozzy made his own band. Guys dont waste your time here -> buy the first albums till sabotage and your ok with the Black sabbath.
B001BC2ZS6|4.0|I will admit that I had to read this book for school back during my high school days and it actually wasn't all that bad. I really enjoyed this book more than I thought that I was going too. It was such an interesting story about how George and Lennie worked together and fed off of each other's spirits to be able to get through each day that came at them. It is a book that I would recommend to any person who is looking to read a great book. It has the highs and lows of an old time story about two guys trying to work towards the American Dream at that point in time. Wonderful story.
1439152780|3.0|I wanted to like this book after so many positive reviews. I was somewhat disappointed that the story took so long to develop. I didn't understand why I cared about the Sisters Blythe after hundreds of pages. The story seemed to develop close to the end of the book, and I honestly don't know if I ended up liking the book because the story finally appeared, or disliking the book becuase it took so long for the story to appear. I agree with other reviewers that the end was unsatisfying and strange. Thus the explanation for my neutral rating of 3 stars.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A unique book and wonderful read. It was pretty dark but I couldn't put it down.  I save five stars for only the best but considered it for this one.
B004BLTNL6|3.0|It is hard to give this any stars without misleading others.  It is what it is, and one either accepts the viewpoint of the violence, or is massively offended.    Rather then go into the movie, I will direct my comments to the disc contents.  First, the movie looks pristine, so it had to have been remastered.  The trailer clips and some of the other supplemental materials show a gritty appearance of the movie.  The actual movie does not show any of that.    Zarchi's feature, The Values of Vengeance is a recent recording, as he talks about the 2010 remake.   He gives background on making and distributing the movie.  The commentary he has with the movie touches on some of what he amplified on in the feature.  It is quite clear that he was very unhappy when the title of the movie got changed from Day of the Woman to its current title.  His commentary is actually quite useful for anyone who wants to know what it is like to make a movie on a budget.  And then try and get it distributed.    The commentary by Joe Bob Briggs was, in my opinion, off putting.  A lot was to rebuttal the reviews by Siskel and Ebert when the movie came out.  And references to other movies in the genre of horror and brutality.  Perhaps this is simply that I am not used to that type of a commentary on a movie.  A lot of time was also put into showing that the movie was really from the point of the victim, Camille Keaton, then the attackers.  There apparently is a disconnect, as some of the comments that he wondered about were already answered by Meir Zarchi's comments on the movie.  So apparently they were done independently.     So if one accepts that this movie fulfilled the message it was intended to do, it could get five stars.  But if violence and brutality is something offensive, then one would probably give it zero stars.    However, the genesis of this movie was when Zarchi actually came across a rape victim shortly after it happened, and he has captured the trauma of the event.  And in his commentary, he has special scorn for how the police handled the victim.    Nudity?  Yes.  Titillation?  Absolutely not. There is no glorification of the attack.  It is brutal and violent.    This clearly is a movie for mature adults only.  Not just adults.  But mature adults.
B004GGM444|5.0|This is a great dubstep album because Skrillex has a very different style than most other dubstep artists.  He includes faster paced samples and has a somewhat...offensive style.  It's offensive in a good way though, it's refreshing and definitely works for a filth filled dubstep song...Cant wait to whomp to it as Wakarusa 2011!
0446563048|5.0|I had heard so many good things about Delivering Happiness before I read it that I had high expectations when I purchased the book.  After reading it I would have to agree that Tony's work lived up to its reputation.  The first third of the book is a quite amusing tale of Tony's time at college followed by his first job at Oracle.  It provides an excellent perspective on the life of a Harvard University student, which is remarkably consistent with the portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg in the Social Network.  Tony's description of his time at Oracle provides insights into the life of young techies in Silicon Valley.  I found myself laughing out loud at many of the colorful anecdotes about his experience at Oracle.    The remaining two thirds of the book explain the origination, development and growth of Zappos.  The key takeaways that most people share about Zappos seem to relate to the company's culture, but I found two other storylines to be equally interesting.  First, Zappos breaks many of the traditional rules about supply chain management.  Unlike most retailers, Zappos actually treats their vendors as true partners. They share sales forecast information, collaborate on merchandising strategies and negotiate fair pricing which enables them to continue to innovate.  The second storyline I found interesting related to marketing.  Tony explains how excellent customer service can be the key to great publicity.  Happy customers will build brand awareness through word-of-mouth marketing.  Of course, most US-based companies have exactly the opposite approach seeking to avoid any human contact with customers.    Tony's writing style is amazing.  It was easier to read than some of the children's book I purchased for my son.  I finished it in just a few hours so there is no excuse for not picking up a copy.
044654759X|4.0|Even though I am a NC native, I've never been a big fan of Sparks.  However, his latest effort was a plesant surprise.  Fast paced and not the predictable ending he's known for.  Definitely worth the time to read, but be prepared for it to fly by, I was turning pages on my Kindle as fast as I could !
0061733199|5.0|Having been disappointed with other books of this genre, I went into reading this book with a healthy dose of critical skepticism. I was delighted to discover that it is an excellent resource for survival in any situation you may find yourself in any environment.<br /><br />Mr. Wiseman has done an excellent job conveying the most information in a compact space that I've seen in any book of this type. He uses concise terminology to describe the survival techniques he gives in this book in an easy to understand way, giving even the most armchair reader of this book an even chance to survive in any given situation they find themselves.<br /><br />The illustrations are excellent and it was wise to include the full color illustrations of edible plants and other things that were included, making it much easier to identify the things that might be critical to identify.<br /><br />Overall, a hearty thank you to Mr. John 'Lofty' Wiseman for this excellent resource. I feel much better prepared to survive any disaster or wilderness situation after having read and absorbed its information.
B002XMGJIU|4.0|Until recently, I had no idea that Patsy Kensit had a musical career.  I've only know about her through the movie, \\"Angels and Insects\\" which I liked to the point that I bought the DVD!  This CD is reflective of 80's synth POP.  But, the songs seem well tailored to her vocals.  And, it works!  Not bad, not bad at all.<br /><br />I rate this CD: 4 stars!<br /><br />Acting chops and Musical chops, also!  Who'd believe it?
0981951244|3.0|The Compound Effect will likely not go down as the next Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill, but it is worth a quick read. I certainly question the reviewers who say they've read and have a library of hundreds of self-help books and this one replaces them all. Darren grew up with a Dad that pushed him, he succeeded and now runs a successful company that puts out loads of mostly helpful tidbits.  This is written in a direct style. It is not elegant (like CS Lewis Mere Christianity, which is about values/paths/focus). This is more like reading...well...his magazine. Keep in mind that we humans have plenty of information (do you really not know that pizza and beer makes you fat and veggies make you thin yet?), but we need constant reminders. This book is a reminder.     I'm in finance and have read maybe 25 similar books (from Dalai Lama to Anthony Robbins)and I do give credit to the book for enlightening me on one thing. I knew that a penny compounded daily for a month was much more valuable than being given $10k. I did not ever apply the principle to my behaviour. I was always putting a marathon on the calendar and failing. Since reading the boook, I do yoga, weights, run--but just a little of one or the other each day. I made simple positive changes and am seeing them slowly but surely compound.     So, thanks Darren. Your book made a difference and I and my wife, 3 kids and others around me are better for it.
B00001ZWTT|4.0|The American Civil War has ended but not for everyone and not for every country either. Everyone wants a part of the United Stats and only Capt. James West and U.S. Marshal Artemus Gordon stand in their way. This award winning film is a timeless keepsake and really does show some of the best of Will Smith and Kevin Kline. Something for everyone in this film from Steampunk to Western and even Salma Hayek behind, a wonderful site to see indeed.<br /><br />The film starts with a scientist running threw the woods with a strange metal collar with magnets attached. Chasing him is a razor sharp spinning disk like a buzz saw and it is gaining on him every step he takes till it catches up to him. Next wae have General `Bloodbath' McGrath played by Ted Levine pulling the disk from the ground as the opening credits begin to roll. This is mostly a fast paced film with a lot of comedic liberties to keep you laughing and wanting to see more. This film has a clever mix of slapstick, suspense, partial nudity of Salma Hayek and Will Smith and plenty of put-downs and innuendos to keep you entertained even after the credits on this film end. Director Barry Sonnenfeld did an excelent job of putting this film together.<br /><br />James West and Artemus Gordon have been tasked by President Ulysses S. Grant to find out what has been happened to missing scientists as well as the plans of Dr. Arliss Loveless played by Kenneth Branagh who has demanded that the United States surrender to him. This film is a love letter to the fans of the original show Wild Wild West that ran in the 60's. It might not be what the fans expected but it is indeed a treat for them and was done in the spirit of the first TV show as we see the exploits of the first 2 Secret Service agents under Grant.<br /><br />Loveless is a Confederate inventor that feels that he was betrayed by The South for surrendering to the Union. Loveless was a maker of advanced weaponry and according to the film the one to make the first tank. It was the use of this tank by McGrath on a freed slave town that caused Will Smith's character Capt. James West to start chasing the general all over the States. It was during the testing of the tank that West's parents were killed as well as the rest of the town. The tank was able to roll in and just shoot everyone over and over as the turret spun. A truly devastating killing machine and the type of weapons that Loveless enjoyed making and testing. He loved it so much that it caused him to loose the lower half of his body, a point that West continually reminds him of in pun after pun.<br /><br />This is by far a serious film and anyone expecting the dramatic westerns that they grew up on will not find that here in this film. This is a comedy that you can watch with the whole family but be prepared to answer all the questions of the little ones that might be around you as they start to pickup on the jokes for all of us adults. This film also has some of the songs sang by Will Smith himself. Oh the days when Rap was actually Rap and not just hate songs.<br /><br />[...]is tank by McGrath on a freed slave town that caused Will Smith's character Capt.

This is by far a serious film and anyone expecting the dramatic westerns that they grew up on will not find that here in this film. This is a comedy that you can watch with the whole family but be prepared to answer all the questions of the little ones that might be around you as they start to pickup on the jokes for all of us adults. This film also has some of the songs sang by Will Smith himself. Oh the days when Rap was actually Rap and not just hate songs.    [...]

B003AXS51A|4.0|Summary: In the 336 pages of The Art of Racing in the Rain, Garth Stein manages to capture the attention of any reader with the compelling story of Enzo, a extremely intelligent golden retriever and his owner, Denny Swift, a human with a passion for racing and cars. The book has many philosophical references and encourages one to think deep into different thoughts.    Quote: \\"That which we manifest is before us; we are the creators of our own destiny. Be it through intention or ignorance, our successes and our failures have been brought on by none other than ourselves.\\"    Review: If you love looking for a novel that makes you look at the world in a new light, then you will love this book.  This book would also be great for any one who loves dogs or who would to get an inside peek at the workings of a dog.
B003L20ICE|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />One of the most striking things about the \\"feel-good\\" drama \\"The Kids Are All Right\\" is that the characters are not always all that easy to like.  They can be moody and naggy, petulant and prickly, immature and self-absorbed; they do and say a lot of stupid, immoral and hurtful things - yet we never question the love they have for one another.<br /><br />Annette Benning and Julianne Moore play Nic and Jules, a middle-aged lesbian couple with two teenaged children, 18-year-old Joni (Mia Wasikowaski), who is all set to go off to college, and 15 year-old Laser (Josh Hutcherson), who's become suddenly curious about the anonymous sperm donor who is his biological father.  After some initial hesitation on the part of Joni, the youngsters set up a meeting with the man, a never-married, motorcycle-riding restaurateur and all-around free spirit named Paul (Mark Ruffalo), whose sudden insinuating of himself into the life of the family results in a great deal of consternation and tension for all concerned.<br /><br />The relationship dynamics in the screenplay by Stuart Bloomberg and director Lisa Cholodenko are intense and complex.  With a career as an obstetrician, Nic is the more \\"grounded\\" of the two women, even though she may be a borderline alcoholic and secretly resents the fact that the more fitfully employed Jules doesn't seem to be able to pull her own weight financially.  This leads to a tremendous amount of tension between the two, a condition that is greatly exacerbated when the less self-confident and less uptight Jules steps across a clearly forbidden line in their marriage.  Nic and Jules also seem to be suffering from the \\"fatigue-factor\\" that seems to creep into just about every relationship once the individuals have been together for too long.  They have even begun to question their feelings for one another, and wonder if the love that was once there so intensely still exists at all - or whether they're just staying together because it`s safe and comfortable to do so and the thought of starting over with someone else is just too daunting a prospect to seriously contemplate.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Paul falls in love with the idea of becoming a dad to two grown kids he clearly likes, but his own unrealistic expectations and lack of maturity threaten to doom any efforts in that direction.  The kids, meanwhile, who often seem more keenly aware of what is going on than the adults involved, frequently become collateral damage in the battle of relationships being waged around them.<br /><br />Benning, who's already garnered universal praise and numerous awards for her work in this film, is not afraid to bring a harsh edge to the role of the often overbearing Nic, almost daring the audience not to like her at times.  Moore has the less flashy part, but she nicely conveys the insecurity and vulnerability of the character she`s playing.  Ruffalo perfectly captures the well-meaning clumsiness of a man too long used to being focused on his own needs and desires to suddenly become a man dedicated to the lives of others.  And Wasikowska and Hutcherson are appealing and touching as the kids who may be all right in the long run but who are going through some pretty tough times at the moment.<br /><br />The major selling point of \\"The Kids Are All Right\\" is, of course, that it centers around what many in society see as an \\"unconventional\\" family, yet the movie itself couldn't be more universal in what it has to say about what it means to be a family and what it means to be in a committed relationship.  Marriage and family are both demanding, complex and messy things - no matter the genders or orientations of the people involved - and this film drives home that fact with unerring truth.o do so and the thought of starting over with someone else is just too daunting a prospect to seriously contemplate.

0061765236|2.0|I found this book for three dollars in a local used book store and was excited at the time. After reading the book I do not understand how everyone can review this book as being so 'emotionally charged' that they need tissues. Pfft. Are you kidding me? Don't think me a monster just yet...I empathize with Emily. To have someone love you like Chris but to feel a certain level of repulsion or unease when they touch you is horrible. But to commit suicide? I found Emily a weak-willed character - alot of you will disagree and argue that she tried to stay with Chris so she wasn't weak - I counter that she only stayed as long as she did because she was too chicken to change anything. Jodi Picoult spins this tale that Emily and Chris were each others life and that to leave would have been parallel to death and so that's what made Emily kill herself. The characters were also irritating in that they, along with their parents, didn't see each other as separate individuals. Ugh...<br /><br />So my point to this rambling review? I want my three bucks back.
B000NYT1M6|4.0|This is a great quality product. Looks like the real thing.  Kids love it!  Would recommend.  It's on the expensive side but really worth it.

B004HD2ZIQ|5.0|Motorhead is one of the truest rock'n'roll bands in the world. They are now at their ever best and this new album proves it again. I got it just yesterday and do not stop listening over and over again. I just think that 2 years is too long to wait for the new one. If you like Motorhead, this one won't disapoint you at all.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Looking for a good Car FM Transmitter MP3 Player? Get this!!    This has got to be one of my favourite items ever purchased on Amazon. The Satechi Soundfly AUX MP3 player looks cool, has some really great features, works as advertised and the sound quality is pretty good. All that for a great price! Shipping was very fast and Satechi customer service followed up via email to make sure that the device was delivered on time and to offer support in case there were any problems. Ordered a second one for a friend and they were equally impressed. Five stars for a first-rate product!
B003DKJ5ZU|4.0|The film is Disney so it's well done and quite cute.  However, it's for the 5-8 year old girl crowd.  Perfect for a little girls' sleep over.  Our whole family has watched the other Tinkerbell movies but this one is too simple to hold everyone's attention. You could have little girls up to 10 enjoy this movie but I think it might be designed for an even younger crowd.  Either way, it's cute, it's Disney and it's unoffensive for the most part.  It's a fantasy movie so it is what it is.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I received a Kindle for Christmas and new right away I wanted to find out what \\"The Girl\\" trilogy was all about.  The first book \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" starts slow.  Unless you are into finances etc. it's very difficult to get through the first quarter of the book.  I thought I was a goner! The book complies all of the necessary information and picks up speed about halfway through.  After finishing it I had to buy the second to see how the story continues! I would definitely recommend reading this book and it's at a great price on Kindle right now.  You won't be able to avoid buying the rest of the triology!
1594202842|5.0|This is not a book written to tell other people how to rear their children. It is about a mother's journey. Every culture and every family thinks their way of raising children is the right way. Sometimes their \\"right\\" way works. Sometimes it backfires in the most ugly and humiliating of ways.    In the end Amy Chua learned that parenting is not \\"one size fits all\\". What benefits one child can suck the life out of another, or worse destroy them.     What I learned from this book was the resilience children can have if their parents' misguided efforts come from a heart full of love.     Above all, \\"Tiger Mother\\" reminded me that most parenting is not about \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\" but about differences in style. Amy's husband was raised by what many would call easy-going and permissive parents, but he is as high an achiever as Amy (who was raised by a Chinese mother) in spite of being allowed to have a childhood without violin lessons.    Amy may still think (in the depth of her heart) that her way is the right way but at least she's acquiesced that her style needed some major tweaking with Lulu and that many other children might not respond so reasonably as Sophia has to her \\"full-on\\" approach.    I took no offense to this book or Amy's style. I respect her. Her approach to parenting is not for the faint at heart because it takes (yes) the willingness to be unselfish. She worked and still took the time to train her children in a way that helped them to succeed and learn many important lessons and habits.     Do I employ the same parenting style? No, but I certainly can learn a few things from her.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|I was having flashbacks today because nearly 5 years ago I saw them at a live concert in Houston(March 2006).  They had just released this album. 10 years ago in 2001(nearly hitting age 21), The Strokes was the first \\"indie\\" band that I took a real interest in. The song \\"Hard to Explain\\" from their first album is still my favorite song from them. Shortly after being interested in this band, I also took interst in the the band Interpol. Today I am 30 and still like this band just the same. Today I popped out this CD to listen to it again. All in all, I am mostly amused by this band for the retro influence and the unique lyrics.<br /><br />I didn't write a detailed, technical review as by now, there are already enough 4-5 star reviews of this album.
0553714546|5.0|Even though I thought I had ordered the unabridged version, I received the abridged version. I'm sure I was mistaken and this was a blessing. The Outlander series books are extremely long and I had the rest of the series waiting to be heard. This version was very well done and gave all the pertinent information.    It was, I think, a used version and was in excellent condition.
B000001FN3|5.0|I can't believe I waited this long to get the CD version of this album which I wore out in the late 70s.  I've been listening to it almost non stop for two weeks and my teenage kids have really gotten into it.    Brilliant concept basing an album on Edgar Allan Poe stories.  But the concept will only be as good as the music which, thankfully, is fantastic.    This comes from an era when the word \\"sophisticated\\" could be used with a straight face to describe a rock album.  But, unlike a lot of other prog rock of the era, the material here is consistently catchy.  The bass and drums are big, loud, and fat - a real classic rock feel.    \\"The Fall Of The House Of Usher\\" is a 16 minute instrumental cycle that may be a matter of personal taste.  I happen to love it and, if you're patient and give it multiple listens, you probably will too.    \\"To One In Paradise\\" ends the CD on its only weak note.  No matter.  All of the rest of the CD really puts the \\"classic\\" in classic rock.
B003YGSLDA|5.0|I used to watch this movie when i was young and I'm so happy that it is on blue ray. This movie is so beautiful and really captures the child's mind in the world that was made. This is a great buy.
B003L77TZI|4.0|I picked this up for my 14 year old daughter on a recent business trip and decided to pop it into the rental car's CD player.  I can't stand most modern pop so was pleasantly surprised to find most of this was good catchy (and naughty) fun.  There were a few boring duds but I just excluded them when uploading to my iPod.      If you just download the hits, you won't be missing too much, although \\"Not Like The Movies\\" is terrific, make sure you get that one.
030746363X|3.0|I admire the author; he's a clever dude, a polymath, an original thinker and a successful self promoter. On the other hand, he's a lousy, disconnected writer who basically published an out of order synopsis of his training log, and a lot of what he's touting here is nonsense or unactionable or unactionable nonsense. How do I know this? Well, like most self-respecting men, I've thought about these sorts of things before. While I'm not a former ranked fighter or tango dancer, I have similar interests  and unlike the author, I am an actual scientist, so I know a lot of places where he is wrong. It's easy to be wrong with this stuff. When it comes to training, you're generally changing a lot of things all at once, and so you can mistake one thing for another. Funny story about bodybuilding history: at one point, the muscleheads became convinced that isometrics was key to radical muscle growth. People tried this for years and got none of the results of the big famous meat-heads: even very smart people like Bruce Lee were taken in by the reports. Later, we found out the real reason isometrics caused such huge growth spurts: the meat heads where also testing this new drug called dianabol while on their isometrics program. I don't know if it was an honest mistake or not, but it's possible that it was, and that sort of mistake happens all the time in sports training.<br /><br />Bodyfat chapter: good stuff here. How to measure, how to have abs (hint: it's generally your lard, not your abdominal muscle conditioning: my ab muscles are enormous, but they only show when I'm lean). Some of the examples of low bodyfat are not so low as he says, but whatever: they're visual goals. Slow carb diet is sensible, though probably more oriented to regular people (who are really fat) than people who are already athletic. Cissus; good stuff -though I think it's dangerous to use for leanness; it should be for joint injuries only. R-ALA is a much safer supplement which allows one to eat too many carbs without becoming too lardy. PAGG ... maybe: stimulants will always work better. Ice packs on your neck? That's silly by inspection; the reason Everest climbers lose so much fat is the same reason people who take DNP lose fat: their metabolisms don't work right when there isn't enough oxygen. I mean, icepacks may have an effect: but it's doubtful. The glucose meter thing is pretty awesome, and seems to verify an intuition I had: many muscleheads seem to think as soon as you put food in your gob, it enters your bloodstream. No. The digestive tract takes some time; hours, before the stuff reaches your blood. First rate work there; particularly the cinnamon and vinegar bits. KB training: yes -very effective, as are most protocols of this nature: my favorite is Tabata. Women preserving their hourglass: thank you for writing this, Tim. I see these women who are shaped like bricks furiously doing sit ups ... and growing enormous muscles in their midsection making them even more brick-shaped: it makes me sad. So much effort which produces exactly the opposite of the intended result. I don't buy the recommended exercise though. The best one is probably to do pilates or yoga type exercises and avoid heavy cardio. Overall a good job on leaning up. Personally, though, I have found crazy diets like the \\"lean gains\\" intermittent fasting diet, or Dave Draper's \\"tuna and water\\" diet work wonders where other diets won't. Those would go into my fat loss personal manual anyhow. He does mention intermittent fasting, though only in the context of \\"life extension.\\" Might work for that purpose; kind of hard to tell though. It definitely leans you up really well.<br /><br />Growing muscles: like Arthur Jones, the author cheats a little. He points out he's gained 20lbs of muscle on at least four occasions. Since he starts out at 150, and he doesn't now weigh 230lbs of veiny protoplasm, that means he more or less gained and lost the same 20-30lbs of muscle numerous times. I could diet down to 160lbs, in a few months, and then get back up to 180 or 190 in a relatively short period of time also: it's called muscle memory. Remember, this dude was a ranked fighter -weight yoyoing is common with such people. As such, I don't really believe in the program for regular joes. Regular folks will be better off with conventional programs like 5x5 or Pavel's \\"bear.\\" Though many swear by glutamine, I've read research which says it is bunk. It's in whey: just eat some whey, and you're covered. Creatine ain't bunk, however: very useful stuff. Either that, or do it \\"walrus moustache and singlet\\" old school style and suck down a bunch of bovril (beef contains much creatine). I really appreciated learning about the Yates row: Iv'e added it to my routine. Worth the price of the book, that was.<br /><br />The sex chapter: Asking the Bay Area \\"sexpert\\" dirtbags he did: probably the worst people in the entire world to ask about such things. They're the type of people who think it is progressive to teach an 8 year old how to put a condom on a banana. Try Stuart Brody as a starting point for proper hetero-sex research. He's a real scientist, unlike the creeps interviewed by the author.  While I'm giving advice; try dating women who aren't neurotic Bay Area twits who are all wrapped up in their heads. Of course these yoyos need to read a book or go to workshops to learn to have an orgasm: the same women need to read a book or go to workshops to learn how to fry an egg. I recommend Eastern Europeans or Brazilians who are all born with properly functioning naughty bits and the ability to fry eggs. True story: ask me how I know. HGC -no, it doesn't directly stimulate male libido. Believe it or not, the spikes in estrogen it produces are probably the culprit.  Cod liver oil and brazil nuts as libido boosters? Yeah, any kind of grease helps: nothing special about those particular flavors, even if Weston Price was a demigod of nutrition research. Eating cheese before sleep is king in this department. It has all the necessary grease, plus lots of calcium and magnesium and probably some unquantifiable components. He's right about sauerkraut and kimchee. No idea why. Ever notice how happy Koreans are? One high point: if I were a young guy and knew what he told the reader about Nina Hartley... my life might have turned out differently. Nina's observation is closest to the truth, even if her physiological suggestions are as useless as the others: self consciousness is the root of most frigidity. Don't know how helpful knowing that is: probably just makes the poor things self conscious.<br /><br />The \\"boosting your testosterone\\" chapter is a good one: he's touting the old Vince Gironda method of eating lots of animal fats. I'd say  he gets causality wrong in some cases; I have no doubt that trips to Nicaragua are more testosterone boosting than eating lots of grass fed beef (or the other high fat diets he recommends for the purpose) in San Francisco. Trips boost test. I looked jacked to the gills when I returned from my last trip abroad, though I hadn't worked out in weeks. His speculation that cell phones lower testosterone is laughably insane. More like, a dude who carries a cell phone is likely to be a cubicle dwelling gelding whose boss and wife enjoys bothering him at all hours, wheras the guys who don't are likely to be working class, poor, or simply don't care to be dangling on other people's telephone wire like an electric marionette. As such, the latter have higher mean testosterone than the former: this has been abundantly proven by science, though you can tell by just looking at people. Storing sperm? What is he? A neurotic career woman? Take HCG (the stuff he touts as boosting libido) if you want kids when you're older, or just grow up and knock someone up now. Also, he's taking cinnamon all the time; I don't think he ever notices the effect of the stuff on SHBG. Cinnamon lowers SHBG. Google it if you don't believe me. I learnedthat from a big meat head in the gym. Listen to big meat heads: they know stuff.<br /><br />Sleep: I feel for the guy -I am high strung and have problems sleeping as well, however, he misses the obvious. Dude takes a bunch of stimulants, wonders why he don't sleep right. Hm, could there be a connection here? Naaaah, just use a nighwave pulse light, or eat almond butter or huperzine or whatever. He actually does have some good advice here, but most of it is common sense; keep the room dark, and at a sensible temperature, eat a heavy meal, and don't drink before you go to sleep. Oh yeah, since he forgot this one: don't take too many stimulants. They screw up your sleep. Duh.  His \\"light\\" melatonin dose is way too heavy: it's very effective at smaller doses, and makes you have insane dreams about fighting zombie hordes. Probably ultimately horrible for you, but it's easier to find than huperzine, which is probably also bad. The polyphasic sleep trick is a good one, but it's also something which makes you miserable. I know: I went to grad school.<br /><br />Injury reversal:  The soup he injected into his body seems insane to me, other than the IGF-1, which is probably what actually healed him. Meat heads regularly use IGF-1 to heal injuries. Of course, it greatly increases cancer risk (as will anything which increases rates of healing: think about it -which is why you shouldn't take cissus to lean up any more than IGF-1), but you pays your money and you takes your chances. Postural therapy; yeah, whaddever: there's some new fad in this every couple of years. He covers a few of them I prefer stretching and the Swedish exercises from the late 1800s. Maybe if I were a pro fighter or something, I'd be more interested in such things, but they all seem like fads to me. Medical tourism for injuries: good idea -American treatments cost too much. Not enough info to act on the idea though. One injury reversal trick he really should share with people: how to fix a bad back. Probably legal reasons why he didn't; it would suck of someone with wonky disks tried healing their back with deadlifts, which is the cure for most wonky backs.<br /><br />Running: no idea if this will work. I hate running. I can do it: I just don't think it's a good idea. I like having knee cartilage. I occasionally test myself by doing the Marines physical. When i do it, I just run (and walk, like he suggests) until I'm where I need to be. It seems to work. Never tried to run seriously though. Running a Marathon? Have you ever looked at people who do that? You guys do realize the dude who ran the first one dropped dead, right? No thanks. People who run marathons are doing themselves a disservice, unless they enjoy looking like skeletor.<br /><br />Getting stronger: he mixes up too much stuff in these chapters. Increasing your bench? Why? Only power lifters and insecure adolescents worry about bench press max. Sane trainers will avoid this exercise (or at least max efforts on this exercise), because most people don't have the correct physique to perform it safely. A much better pressing exercise is overhead pressing, which is actually good for the shoulders. If you don't want to do this, do handstand push ups: they rock, and require no equipment. The overall prescription is more or less true: low reps, heavy weights. Do it all the time (like, longer than 4 hours a week), and you will get stronger.<br /><br />Swimming? Hitting a baseball? Holding your breath for a long time? Life extension tricks? I don't know about these or care very much. I might learn to swim one day. I think Ben Franklin wrote a book on it, back when it was an uncommon skill among Westerners. Real superman type skills which most people can learn would be more like ... how to break a brick with your hand, or how to throw a proper punch, or one of the many martial arts trick punches, like the one Bruce Lee used to show off in demonstrations.<br /><br />The supplementary chapters on self experimentationand spotting bad science are quite good: the best in the book. I suggest readers of the book should skip right to the chapter on self experimentation, read through the bad science section, then move on to the rest of the book. Yes, I realize this should be a blog entry, but my blog is about physics and finance.n the gym. Listen to big meat heads: they know stuff.

B002NUULNG|5.0|Great buy! I love GITS and the blu-ray version is definitely easy to swallow. I had no problem accepting the changes. For those of you who can't they've included the original version in HD as well!! Great buy would definitely recommend to all fans of anime big an dsmall.
B002VWONB2|5.0|I'm not going to review the movie, suffice to say it's one of my favorites and a classic. This is more about the presentation in Blu-ray. I found it excellent. The movie is crisp and clear, the only graininess was the stock war footage used and there is nothing to be done about that. I had no issues with the sound quality, none of the low volume issues others have brought up. My only nitpick is at certain times in the movie the characters have what I describe as \\"stars in their eyes\\" where the lighting used reflects heavily in the eyes of the actor or actress. I noticed it in the Blu-ray for the first time. I can't say if this effect has shown up in other formats, but I did not notice it before viewing the Blu-ray. I bought this to replace a \\"borrowed\\" DVD that never got returned, I think it's a decent upgrade from the regular DVD but not essential if you already own it. There are plenty of good extras on this version, enough to keep almost any avid fan of the movie satisfied.
0061367036|5.0|I'm very happy with my purchase. Both products are in a great condition, and they are exactly as i have imagined them. I plan to buy again sometime, because the quality of the products is great. They also arrived much more quickly than i thought [actually, in less than 10 days, and i live in Greece].  I strongly recommend this book to every supernatural fan. I'm sure you're gonna be really happy if you buy it.
0786868724|5.0|This was a delightful book.  Because we live in Detroit where a portion of the story took place, it was especially interesting.  It was a \\"quick read,\\" but a book I plan to keep so I can refer to it - for devotionals, etc. - in the future.
0061706620|5.0|This book is really great for the fans! It is exactly the same with the one appeared in the show. It is also hardcovered, so you don't have to worry about the cover. I love it! I recommend it to every fan that wants to know more about the famous \\"john winchester's journal\\". I'm going to buy it as a gift for my best friend. It's a great choice!
B001P5Q6FC|5.0|Please disregard the above comments about how the band hasn't progressed or how the album isn't that impressive. This album is far better than ANY LOG ALBUm to date. The songs are faster and more intense, the lyrics are well-thought out and powerful, and every member is at their peak. Nuff said.

B000JIHP88|4.0|This mobile has smoothing, soft music and slow motion which was the main factor for purchase. It's not too loud and won't keep a baby ((or you)) awake. The light it gives off isn't too bright. The mobile not only rotates 3 small, plush animals but raises and lowers 3 leaves. In a dark room a child won't be able to see the motion even with the night light feature on. It only plays for 18 minutes. Which is good and bad. Good: plays just long enough for a tired child to fall asleep before turning off. Bad: doesn't play long enough and upsets the child if it turns off. The remote is nice but only works if it's been on very recently. You can't start the mobile with the remote. Battery life seems good.    This is not designed for a soft-sided crib or playpen (which is what we originally had as our child's bed for the first few months). It's also not designed to fit on a very thick/wide crib rail. I was considerate of this fact when I finally bought a full size crib recently. I still had a little trouble mounting the mobile as the 'screw' part was far too long and I had to cut a couple of inches off so the crib could sit closer to the wall.  ***UPDATE 7/24/2011***  After having this mobile for nearly a year it stopped spinning properly. The music and lights working perfectly. So I thought the batteries were weakening. Even with new batteries the mobile needed help to start spinning sometimes. I don't know if it stopped spinning once it started as I would leave the room so my child could sleep. I contacted Fisher Price regarding the issue and they have asked me to ship just the base to them for a replacement. Seems to be a known issue.  ***UPDATE 12/13/2011***  I've had the replacement for about 4mons now and it seems to be fine. After reporting the issue, and shipping just the base back, it took about 6wks to receive the replacement which is a brand new mobile. I had expected just a new or refurbished base...seems kind of a waste. Oh, well. The 6wk wait sucked as my daughter still relies on this to sleep. We have the new one and haven't had an issue at all.

B001SN78JO|5.0|Ok, funny thing is, I had forgotten all about this movie - and I can't believe I did!  I had borrowed a DVD from my sister, and normally, I skip the previews (only like watching them at the theatre) - anyway - this time, I decided to watch the previews...THANK GOODNESS!!!  I couldn't believe I didn't own this DVD because I remember it was a funny movie!  OH I HAD FORGOTTEN JUST HOW FUNNY!!!  Jim Carey is at his comedic BEST in this film!  There are a few specific scenes (won't spoil them for you!) that I rewound a thousand times & laughed my head off!!  LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie!  It also has a really great message to it as well!  If you haven't seen it - watch it!  If you don't own this movie - BUY IT!!!  One of my FAVORITE movies!!!
B003AXS51A|4.0|It doesn't matter if you have ever had a dog in your life. You will cry while reading this.  At first I was rather disappointed by the idea that the entire book will be giving the dog's point of view on things. I thought it would get boring at some point, but the author allowed for some interesting assumtions to keep the story interesting. I couldn't put it down.  Also, it helped me deal with my dog's death.
B002KKBV92|5.0|My husband found a 42 piece box of Geomag's at a yard sale and brought them home. My grandson discovered them at age 4, and has played with them almost constantly since then. It has reinforced his learning of shapes, taught him about building and construction, magnets and patience. Many afternoons he would put down Lego's and/or video games to play with the Geomag set. I am back today to pick up a larger set for his 5th birthday, and I *know* this is going to be a favorite present that will continue to enthrall and entertain him for several years to come. I highly recommend this entertaining and educational toy, especially for the 4 to 10 year old group.
0393078299|5.0|This is a book of corruscating history and inspirational biography, wrapped up in a universal romance about science. Quantum is one of those rare books where a glimpse into the inner mind of modern scientific genius is gained on a thrilling ride through world events.<br /><br />Manjit Kumar takes the most fascinating human century - the 20th and what must be the most mind-skewering branch of science, and creates new history on the back of the old. You feel the forces of history shifting plates and bearing down darkly on human fate. The tide engulfs a bewildered Albert Einstein, exiling him from his home and his work, and it divides into new camps colleagues already riven by scientific controversy. Kumar's native skill lies in the way he brings this great clash of ideas, beliefs and scientific values to life, showing how desperately they mattered to Einstein, Neils Bohr, Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrodinger, the quantum giants.<br /><br />This is also a story of scientific obsession. While Bohr vanquished Einstein in their public clashes over the strangeness of the microworld, he never recovered from Einstein's refusal to accept the new orthodoxy. It remained a splinter in his soul. The reason for such high stakes, as the book's title prefigures, is this was a battle not just for the soul of physics, but for the nature of reality.<br /><br />The 20th Century contained more reality than most, with its total warfare and toxic genocides. That the era marked a retreat from realism in literature and thought is therefore unsurprising. What still astounds is that realism fell from favour in frontline science. Bohr demanded of his apostles a rejection of a mind-independent reality. Quantum chronicles how physicists no longer spoke of a 'real' universe out there - reality was confined to the results of observations.<br /><br />Yet Quantum's riveting denouement shows how 'reality' never really went away, and the book movingly charts Einstein's posthumous rehabilitation. Modern work by John Bell, an Einstein proponent allowed physicists to confirm 'spooky' quantum behaviour - something that to Einstein's horror almost looked like ESP - but the findings also won a victory for scientists who viewed the universe they worked with every day as being 'real'. Today, realism is once more a respectable creed for physicists. Einstein comes to life in these pages as a witty, flawed, far-sighted visionary.<br /><br />This is the story of an idea. While mankind went to war over land and supremacy and as millions lost their lives, scientists fought over a concept in abstract space which altered very little. Yet to read of its pursuit among these great figures is to be struck by awe, and at a time when man seems out of harmony with his universe, this commitment to grasp something so deep, so elusive and mysterious restores belief in the other universe of the human mind.<br /><br />Einstein fought against no-go areas in science even if it led to ideas which disproved his own. He wrestled with two veils that cloaked reality, one man-made, the other a  facet of nature. Bohr claimed the veil 'was' reality. That cloak, at least for now, has been torn away. Quantum is a passionate science odyssey. The author's deep achievement is the natural way he allows the story to unfold. Or rather, he allows it to just seem that way. With such complex ideas and immense personalities, this talent requires a rare modesty, one that merits all the recognition Quantum has already attracted, appreciation that can only deepen over time.Einstein proponent allowed physicists to confirm 'spooky' quantum behaviour - something that to Einstein's horror almost looked like ESP - but the findings also won a victory for scientists who viewed the universe they worked with every day as being 'real'.

B002ZG974M|4.0|I was very excited when this movie came to DVD as I had heard a lot of positive reviews previously. It is done somewhat like a documentary following 4 babies as they grow from birth to first steps. It does not have narration or translation so you are just watching what is going on. It seemed to be showing that despite very different cultures and techniques for parenting, children grow and develop similarly. It was a very touching movie. My 18mo daughter who does not normally watch TV, did like seeing the babies and animals on TV.

Its hard to get in Australia but why did I wait so long?
0071752854|4.0|Last week I was approached by McGraw-Hill to review Pitch Anything by Oren Klaff and I keenly accepted the offer. Having finished the book last night I'm happy to report this is one of the more interesting AND entertaining business books that I've read.<br /><br />In Pitch Anything Oren introduces his S.T.R.O.N.G theory to teach us why our pitches are failing, how to reach out to the inner brain and offer our audiences what they really want. He provides many techniques in how to avoid the obvious traps that put us at a disadvantage and he uses personal examples to help us understand. He confirms one of my popular beliefs that brevity is king, he points out the obvious (numbers are dull) and suggests how we can cause desire from our pitches.<br /><br />The book is relatively short at 200 pages, which is a blessing and a curse. I dislike long, heavy business texts, preferring books like Pitch Anything that focus in on one business element. However, early in the book Oren states that his methods could be used far beyond multi-million dollar business pitches, but they're never discussed in this book. I would like to have had a few less personal stories about obtaining missing millions of dollars and more information on how the every-man could use Oren's technique to pitch a pay rise, or how to effectively position yourself in large group meetings. This book would then become relative to a much wider audience.<br /><br />The highest accolade I can give this book is that I WANT to recommend it to others, but I WON'T, as I don't want them using these techniques against me!
B0000047BA|4.0|Remember seeing the movie years ago (not great) but liked the soudtrack. One day it popped into my head so I chased it on Amazon. Still good - John Lee Hooker with a bit of Miles Davis tootling. It works - think cool background music for a steamy evening on the back verandah (porch for those in the US) winding down after a hard day. Overall more a John Lee album than a Miles Davis one.
B003UERZ88|5.0|Who said heavy metal music sucks now? Well, you have clearly not heard the new Rob Halford CD entitled \\"Made of Metal\\". To me this is just another fine example of Rob's legacy of metal-music-perfection. The Godfather of Metal proves once again that he is the grandmaster of the ultimate heavy metal experience. You can thank me later.

I highly recommend it.  I reference it everytime I make any cookies and even cakes. It is sectioned off by holiday/ocassion: it has one page with a full color photo of cookies and the next tells you how to make each designed cookie each one has a number so its easy to see which one goes with what \\"how-to\\".  Definitely a must have.

B000T9OP7G|5.0|Rarely do I ever look forward to anything on TV, BUT this show grabbed my attention. There were a few holes in the story-line, and it took me awhile to get used to a teenage Terminator who looked like a fragile young woman (I was going to say \\"girl\\" but Summer Glau was in her late twenties when she filmed this show) but the clever story-lines, dialogue, and good acting kept me coming back every week. The series ended on a cliff-hanger, and I was pretty pissed it didn't return for a third season to tie up all the loose ends. Some people think the show ended because viewership had slacked off when the show was moved to Friday nights. However, it may be due to the fact that when the second season ended, the 'rights of ownership' on the Terminator franchise was caught up in a litigation battle in the courts. I don't know what the outcome of the decision was, or who owns the rights now, but I do hope they decide to pick up where they left off, and perhaps do a two-hour TV movie and make the fans of TSCC happy again.

0375420525|5.0|I adore this book. I can read it a hundred times and never be bored. Truly an experience, mentally and, somewhat unexpectedly, physically as well, as the book uses page layout and text color as part of the experience. Instead of coming off as a cheap gimmick, the continually changing style of narrative and physical composition instead perfectly enhance the story within a story within a story, drawing you into the madness of the characters and their experiences.

0679411585|5.0|It's difficult to add anything that hasn't already been said about this masterpiece by Lt. Gen. Moore and Joe Galloway. Everything about it is well done. It captures the ferocity of battle like few other books ever written. The language used is perfect.<br /><br />I would like to add a couple personal notes. I taught juvenile delinquents for several years. I put together a long unit about Vietnam because I think it is often neglected in public school history classes and because I had a lot of freedom in what I taught. It was very extensive and included an entire day touring a National Guard aviation unit where the kids could tour a real Huey and a visit by a Marine Infantry vet with two tours. I ran through it at least once a year, and it was very popular even with the other teachers. I used Lt. Gen. Moore's introduction to this book as the introduction to the class every time I taught it. I would draw unit patches and medals all over the board and just stand there and read the introduction to \\"We Were Soldiers Once...and Young\\" in its entirety. I don't think anything ever written better captures what it was like to be there. The introduction to the book is worth the price of the book.<br /><br />It made me choke up every time I read it, and it caught their attention for the rest of the unit on Vietnam. That's saying a lot from kids who were expelled from public school.
B003L20IFQ|2.0|Where oh where to begin?  \\"Buried\\" has been widely praised by critics and moviegoers alike.  I have no idea why.  Were they brainwashed during the 94 minute hell hole that is \\"Buried\\"?  Did Ryan Reynolds personally go to each critics house and do their laundry?  This film was poorly written, acted and the third act was not put together well at all.  It's a shame too because the beginning of the film had promise.  I had high hopes for the star Ryan Reynolds based on his impressive performance in \\"The Amityville Horror\\" remake, unfortunately he didn't deliver in this outing.  This film is the definition of the phrase \\"style over substance\\".<br /><br />\\"Buried\\" is the story of an American contractor working in Iraq as a driver.  His group is ambushed by supposed terrorists who kill some and kidnap others.  Paul played by Reynolds does not fair so well as he is buried alive in the vast Iraq desert.  The film begins as a black screen with hardly any sound, we start to hear breathing as tension and fear begins to build.  Paul realizes that he's been buried underground with a cell phone, Zippo lighter, knife, flask of alcohol, flashlight and glow-sticks.  His battle begins to find a way out of the grave danger he's in when the kidnappers call demanding a ransom.<br /><br />First, the good things; though they are few.  The decision to film entirely inside the coffin was smart.  It added an extra layer of realism to an already terrifying concept.  \\"Buried\\" was very well shot and produced as seen in the first act.  It had excellent sound and camera work as well so the tension was genuine.  Director of Photography Eduard Grau gave just enough space between the camera and Reynolds to not overdue the claustrophobic feeling.  The cinematography scored very high points for me, hence the 2/5 instead of 1/5.  The idea of being buried for ransom was new and I appreciated Iraq being the setting.  The first act was intense and fearful as the plot began to come around, but it was ruined with the second and third acts.<br /><br />I mentioned the concept was fresh and new, which I appreciated, but the way in which the plot unfolded was just ridiculous.  There were so many instances that I thought were just completely implausible and unnecessary.  Once Paul finally gets in contact with the State Department, the representative quietly and secretively tells him to contact a group specifically set up in the middle east to deal with kidnap situations.  Why on earth would this information had to have been whispered to Paul?  Why couldn't the State Department just contact them for Paul?  A very unrealistic moment.<br /><br />One of the things left in the coffin for Paul to find was a \\"Zippo\\" lighter.  He had that thing lit for more than half of the film.  In a low oxygen environment that isn't the best idea.  Not to mention it seemed to have a constant abundance of butane.  Also, when using the cell phone he continued to use the Zippo to light the space in front of him.  Sure this works for the camera lighting but is this realistic? No.<br /><br />Speaking of the cell phone, it was obvious (and told to Paul), that since he was getting a signal he was not that far beneath the surface.  At one point someone says to him that he must not be more than three feet down.  If I were Paul I would have found a way to break through the wood and dig upwards three feet to safety.  So again, unrealistic.<br /><br />Those are just a few examples of why this movie fails.  At one point later in the film I literally felt insulted by the writing.  It is such a shame too because this had high potential to be a unique, intense movie experience.  I can't fault Reynolds completely because I know he has the chops to pull of intense drama but he just was not directed well.  \\"Buried\\" was made by inexperienced filmmakers and it showed.  It boggles my mind that this is getting such good reviews, specifically from the likes of Roger Ebert.<br /><br />I only need to direct you to the \\"100 Things we learned from Buried\\" thread on IMDB's message board to see the kind of terrible writing showcased in this film.  See it and form your own opinion.  Drop me a line if you agree or disagree.<br /><br />[...]ge board to see the kind of terrible writing showcased in this film.  See it and form your own opinion.

B004LRZ2YC|3.0|This movie, \\"Let Me In\\", tries to capitalize on the critical and commericial success (for a foreign language, art-house movie) of the previous year's \\"Let the Right One In\\" from Sweden. It is adequate if you refuse to read subtitles. Elias Koteas makes most movies worth watching and this one is no exception. But the talented Richard Jenkins is pretty much wasted here.

0395925037|1.0|My review is about this particular translation and not necessarily the content. I have always had an interest in WWII and decided to finally read the book that Hitler wrote. I must say I wish I had done more research before buying any edition.<br /><br />I first bought this edition. I had no idea that there were different English translations at the time. This one is by Manheim. When I started reading it I was puzzled. It did not make sense to me. Not only was it so poorly written that many parts did not make sense, it also made no sense to me why some of the sentences would be structured in such an odd way. It also did not sound anything like Hitler to me, though I did really not know what he sounded like this certainly was not it. This sounded wrong to me. I had to look again and see if it was really Hitler's book it was so poorly written. It turns out it was NOT Hitler's book. This Manheim edition is not actually Hitler's words but an \\"interpretation\\" of his words by Manheim. The foreword sets the tone and makes it clear that the translation is not unbiased. Since purchasing this book I have done more research and I have seen claims that Manheim intentionally produced a poor quality translation to make Hitler look rambling and to make it hard to read. I tend to believe this, though it sounds conspiritorial to me, it does make sense. It would explain why such a bad translation was ever published. It is clearly harder to read than the other two major translations by Murphy and Ford.<br /><br />I find it hard to believe a publisher would even publish something this poorly copywritten. It has several obvious errors, such as claiming a battle occurred in 1945 when it should have been 1845 and the book was written in 1924 so it is obviously not 1945. You would think the publisher would fix something like this after publishing it since 1943 but it is only one of many errors in this edition which have never been fixed. Many parts are left in German which is never translated and overall the English is simply ghastly. It sounds like someone who spoke English as a second language and their first language was not German tried to translate it. At the end of almost every sentence I scratched me head and asked why in the world anyone would write a sentence like that. It is just terrible so I do not recommend Manheim's translation. There are also no historical notes in the book, just cryptic footnotes that are either in German, or make no real sense. Manheim's book was a waste of time and money. I gave up 100 pages into the book. I almost dismissed it as a bad book thinking Hitler was rambling but then I saw a forum post that compared different versions so I took another look at the different versions of Mein Kampf. Some people have claimed Manheim intentionally wrote this way to make Hitler sound disjointed and rambling...I would not go that far, but I would suggest he was unqualified to translate Mein Kampf.<br /><br />James Murphy also wrote a translation which is good and much easier to read, however it is also much shorter than the original German editions. I am not sure what was cut but I did not want to read Murphy's abridged version.<br /><br />I later found the Ford translation(also here on Amazon with the black cover and white drawing of Hitler in profile, so make sure you get that one) and it is much better. It is easier to read and has lots of historical notes which help to put Hitler's words in a historical perspective. If you want to actually understand Hitler's words, get the Ford translation instead.<br /><br />As for the book itself. I loved it!! I found it very compelling and an interesting perspective of history. I would not suggest anyone read it in isolation though. There are a number of other good books on Hitler and his life and career which you should read too to put everything in perspective.

B001IMFHTS|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Claudio Abbado and his many DVD's, especially his almost complete Mahler set.<br /><br />I looked forward to receiving this set of Abbado's interpretation of the Beethoven Symphonies. The set doesn't play in my Blu-ray player. Other DVD's play just fine, but this one doesn't. I see the disclaimer and the Euro-something logo but then the screen goes black and nothing more happens. I've tried all of the discs in this set. They work just fine on my computer but the screen is way smaller than my wide-screen TV and the audio system on my PC is not the same as a stereo set with good speakers. I tried cleaning the lens on my Blu-ray player but it made no difference. I'm going to try re-attaching my old DVD player and see if these discs play with it.<br /><br />Having seen the incredibly BORING video of von Karajan's set I look forward to seeing Abbado and members of the orchestra in performance. The problem with Karajans' set is the static images of him conducting. He looks like a corpse.<br /><br />AMAZON needs to learn the way of listing classical music performances. There is NO existing standard which includes the phrase \\"...staring...conductor, singer, etc.\\" Starring? This isn't a movie or television program, not theatre. It is classical music in performance. The correct terms include well known things such as \\"conductor\\" \\"________Orchestra/Symphony\\" \\"Soprano\\" etc. There is no such thing as \\"starring\\" in classical music.
1402760663|5.0|This book was SOOO good! It is sad, detailed and sometimes gruesome in it's telling of the history of different tribes and groups of American Indians. Some of the instances are well known, and some are not, but they way they are told brings new information and a new understanding to what happened. The illustrated edition is AWESOME. If you like old pictures and seeing who is being written about, this is a great way to go!
B000ANXLB2|2.0|Nobody can beat Herbert von Karajans' CD recordings of the Beethoven symphonies (1963) for quality of sound and performance in that era. I believe the 1963 CD's are still among the very best recordings of the Beethoven symphonies.<br /><br />The DVDs' made more recently are difficult to watch. Von Karajan looks like a corpse on the podium. The camera shows him in static positions. I haven't viewed the entire set but from what I've seen the orchestra may as well be in another room since they are not shown in the videos.<br /><br />AMAZON needs to learn the way of listing classical music performances.

B004AHNIGM|5.0|and in great form.  This offering from Gregg Allman is gritty, yearning, and a blessing for blues lovers (and Allman fans).  The acoustic emphasis on the cd brings home the nature of the blues.  Another terrific T-Bone Burnett collaboration.  This one hits it out of the park.

She has the voice, melody and overall package for the music she presents (with the help of her band).    FAVE TRACKS ON LUNG are as follows:  1)   Dog Days Are Over  2)   Between Two Lungs  by far are just two of the tracks I can listen to day in, day out.

0393072231|5.0|Thank you Mr. Lewis for an informative and very entertaining book.  Given the subject matter this could have been a tedious read.  However, his understanding of the inside of an Investment Banking firm, along with his character and story development, made this book almost impossible to put down.  At the same time being very educational, with regard to very difficult subject matter.  This is the first book I've read by Michael Lewis and based on my experience I intend to read more.
0061743526|5.0|\\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is more than the usually discussed issues of racial bigotry and the human condition under trial. Don't let me take away from those values at all... but Harper Lee has written a book transcending a literary social commentary. She has written a love story.<br /><br />A love story? huh? Who gets married? Does anyone kiss? Are there passages of deep romance? No, no, no... none of that. Try instead family love.<br /><br />Atticus is the kind of single dad we need to see more of in this generation. He cares for his children so much that he protects them from the fires of his grown-up life of representing an innocent man. He protects them from the full impact of his neighbor's lies. He shows them how to love them, even though he knows his neighbors hate him and the love of fellow man he represents.<br /><br />If all Atticus, the father, did, was love the innocent man, he would be doing a good thing, but he demonstrates love and allows dignity (when possible) for the ones persecuting the innocent. He shows he is a big man, and his children mimic this sense of understanding.<br /><br />Deeply rooted in the memories of his children, the story has a gentle subtext of growing up. You can almost taste the lemonade of the porch and smell the flowers in nearby gardens.<br /><br />Lee's power as an author here is that she does let her statements about humanity overtake the story. Rather, she lets the story tell the story, and she just writes down what happened in her imagination.<br /><br />Her characters are not paste-up Southern children or adults, but complex characters all of us relate to (even me up here near Chicago!). Relationships are embedded in the depth of being neighbors. This creating a milieu of angst in Atticus' children when they see the adults warring in court and out of court in matters of truth.<br /><br />I fully recommend this book, and think to give it the best reading possible, examine how interwoven the story is with its various cultures and characters. The power of Lee's message will be plenty clear.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />HungarianBookstore.comlenty clear.    Anthony Trendl  HungarianBookstore.com

0425188809|5.0|Watchers is my favorite Dean Koontz novel (so far).  I loved every minute of reading this book; it has every emotion known to mankind within its pages.  My senior English teacher noticed I was reading Stephen King's The Tommyknockers back in 1989 and told me she also read Stephen King.  She asked me if I had read any of Dean Koontz's novels and I replied no.  She told me that his best (at that time) was Twilight Eyes and Watchers.  Needless to say I was on a Stephen King high back then and proceeded like all of his fans to devour his work first.  Now that I'm older and have read all of King's work I have decided to give other horror authors the same opportunity and I selected Dean Koontz to continue the reading trend.  I have read several of his novels since and have enjoyed each and every one of them but the two that my teacher told me about eluded me until last year.  I picked them up and read them back to back and discovered that she was right!  Both novels are wonderful and I encourage you to give them a chance.      I am formost a horror enthusiast and I have to admit that while Dean Koontz strays into terror and suspense more these days I can assure you that Watchers has plenty of all three!  There were many terrifying moments in the book as well as tender moments that I really felt as I read.  Watchers has everything you're looking for and is fast-paced enough to keep you on the edge of your seat.  I was amazed at how Koontz's monster brought forth chills as well as deep sympathy (and most of the time right together at the same time) each time it appeared.  We all know Koontz is a dog enthusiast and no book that I've read (and I have a lot to go still) does canines better justice than Watchers.  Take my advice and read this wonderful trip into terror and love.  You'll be glad you did.
B002RKSZWG|5.0|When people think of Jane Austen they think of her major works such as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and \\"Emma\\" but I think that \\"Persuasion\\" is one of her best books that is often overlooked.

B000BNX4MC|4.0|This lively John Hughes offering from the summer of 1986 depicts a certain joyousness in watching a charmingly irritating Teflon truant from a well-to-do Chicago family play hooky from school in an incident that marks his ninth absence of the semester.   A boyish looking Matthew Broderick, then in his twenties,pulls off the title character's part so skillfully that he makes detestable behavior amusing.   We find this \\"righteous dude\\"(school secretary Edie McClurg's Grace's notation of how Ferris is viewed by students) lying in bed one fine spring morning, deciding that he \\"couldn't possibly handle school\\" on such a day in one of many asides to an invisible audience, and tell his parents(Lyman Ward and Cindy Pickett)that he is ill in a dramatic performance that earns the ire of his sister, Jeanie(Jennifer Grey)who isn't buying it for a minute. His parents, unfortunately, can be conned so easily, it's pathetic!   Once his family have left, Ferris steps up his plan to enjoy a day on the town with his frequently ill, insecure and hypochondriac friend, Cameron(Alan Ruck), the product of of a repressive and dysfunctional household whose materialistic off-screen father has incredibly skewered values, and his girlfriend, Sloane Peterson(Mia Sara). He calls Cameron, goes to his house and finnagles him into getting his father's classic red Ferrari out of the garage. Having made a few calls to Principal Rooney's (Jeffrey Jones) office, pretending to be her father and claiming that there has been a death in her family, he gets Sloane out of school,letting the Principal see him incognito and in stylish-looking car, and their illicit day of fun begins.   They park the car in a city garage, leaving it in the hands of two attendants(Richard Edson and Larry Flash Jenkins) whose recklessly cavalier behavior could easily match Ferris' own.   The school day finds an aggravated Jeanie being given condolences from schoolmates concerned about her brother's health(Ferris having spread theword among the underclass students who look up to him). Ferris has fiddled with the school computer to mark down his true number of absences, so Principal Rooney has to withdraw his complaint about his many absences to his mother during a phone call--one of many instances in which his authority will be undermined during the day.   We see the classes Ferris is missing throughout the day, most notably the one taught by Ben Stein's deadpan Economics teacher.   Among the places they visit is a swank restaurant, where the casually dressed trio are challenged by a stuffy Maitre D'(Jonathan Schmock), but are once again able to make an adult look like an idiot and get in. They are nearly spotted by Mr. Bueller,attending lunch there with his business partners, but somehow manage to avoid his detection even then.    They travel to the top of the Sears Tower, attend a ball game, and spend time at the Art Institute of Chicago,where they link up with a class of Elementary School children on a field trip, all without anyone asking them why they aren't in school.  --Perhaps it is presumed they too, are on a field trip, although there's less credibility  there without a larger class of students and a supervising teacher.   A water tank reading \\"Save Ferris\\" further reveals how well the High-Schooler's ruse is succeeding.    The two people who most want to see Ferris grilled for his offenses, Jeanie and Mr. Rooney gradually and unexpectedly gravitate toward each other at the Bueller home. The results will be that one will end up in trouble and one will ultimately have to concede defeat.    Ferris' ruse reaches its climax when he slips on to a float at a downtown parade celebrating German heritage(Noticeably, he has an appropriate last name),pantomimes to Wayne Newton's \\"Danke Schoen\\", and leads everyone in rocking to the Beatles' rendition of \\"Twist and Shout\\". Even his father, back at work in a nearby office building is stirred by the sound.But if only he had gone to his window andlooked down below...    The film loses its verve after this point. But the afternoon finds the teenagers sneaking a romp in a neighbor's pool and jacuzzi, and finally back at Cameron's house to return the Ferrari to the garage in a scene where Cameron finally confronts his anger issues in an intense scene in which property is damaged.That, too, is the influence of Ferris Bueller.    Distracted from work by a situation with Jeanie(during which the latter breifly encounters a young Charlie Sheen), Mrs. Bueller angrily drives home with the daughter that she and her husband believe to be the bad seed, and Mrs.Bueller narrowly misses seeing her purportedly ailing son land against her car just right in front of her as she is at a stop sign, as he rushes home from his day of illicit adventures.    Mr. Rooney makes one final attempt to confront the Buellers at their home as all the main parties converge there, but an ironic twist that has always made me cringe when watching it results in his being repelled for the final time.   Certain details, such as Rooney's wallet being left on the Bueller's kitchen floor, and their dog, who attacked Mr. Rooney, lying unconscious after having a \\"Get Well Soon\\" flower pot arrangement for Ferris dropped on him may later bring pause to Ferris' parents.But we don't see how Ferris may eventually pay for the trouble he causes. For him, the story ends on a note of impish triumph.

0525951652|3.0|I like Follett's many novels, some are among my favorite books.    This one is too predictable. It also gets a little tedious waiting for real plot developments.    I doubt I will read the other two books in the series.
B000GIXLO8|5.0|I purchased my copy from amazon through a seller who advertised it as new.  When I received it, it was indeed shrink wrapped like a new DVD but the first disc had dried gunk on it, and there were smudges and light fingerprints on either side of it as well as on the second disc.  Don't know if this was false advertising or a packaging error but I was surprised at the condition of a \\"new\\" disc.      After cleaning it, the movie played fine.  I had no problems.  I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't already own the movies.  It would be a waste to buy if you already own either the theatrical or extended versions of the movie, especially since the other versions have lots more special features, and you would essentially be buying one or both versions twice.  This is a very bare bones set.  Just the film and one documentary. The main benefit to this set is having both versions together, where as the benefit to buying the previous sets would be the abundance of special features.
B004L3AR0K|3.0|Even though there a couple of moments this movie feels more like it belongs to the drama genre than a romatic comedy. Spoiler alert!!  ******The character played by Hathaway, the one Gyllenhaal's character falls for, has Parkinson's disease********  Basically in the movie this couple are trying to maintain their relationship casual but eventually for one another: I don't want to give anything away beyond what I've mentioned before it's just that the movie ends like a romantic comedy would(Tiny spoiler alert! ****the boy and the girl wind up together..I know, I didn't see that coming either :)***)but when it ends (and maybe it's just me)  I couldn't help but feel that the drama was just starting...  As I've stated don't expect too many laughs, I actually laughed out loud a couple of times but because of the subject matter it seemed more like comic relief in a drama (I don't mind since I actually like dramas). Also if you like either Gyllenhaal or Hathaway (physically speaking) in this movie you get to see plenty of them several times (not for kids because of sex and nudity).
B000YE3TVY|5.0|The Timberland Earthkeepers are a very comfortable boot.  Run a little large (went a half size down) therefore, roomy. Durable so far.  The \\"brown leather\\" did fade onto lighter colored socks...Overall, a great boot.

I liked this book for this one purpose - experiments, out of box thinking and connecting dots. I've experimented some food and blood sugar impact as I'm diabetic. So far my energy level and sugar level both are fantastic. I'm going to slowly do my own research which will obviously be inspired by Tim's methodologies- write down, track and monitor everything.    What next Tim? - Four Hour Mind? :)
B004KPLVV8|5.0|This movie is awesome, i saw the 25th anniversary edition, but all in all it's the same movie. this movie is way ahead of it's time. the special effects in this movie was gtreat. Disney never fails to deliver great entertainment.
1599218011|2.0|This book really tells you nothing new.  Eat more vegetable and juice them to get to be more palatable to you.  If you're looking for a book that lays it all out for you in a step by step fashion, this is not it.  The books basically spews random facts like a Google search and, I guess, expect you to put them together to form your own plan.  You could have done this without the book.  I gave it two stars for her writing style, which I like.
B001TODCII|5.0|I am a fan of Liam Neeson, I just believe his charisma in front of a camera is cool no matter what movie it may be. The trailer of the movie caught my attention right away, the story may be a little thin but the action and constant pace of the film will keep you tuned in.<br /><br />Taken is a story about a CIA retiree named Brian Mlls who is a father to a 17 year old girl with ex-wife who remarried a rich man. The connection between the mother and father is very disjointed, they don't agree on everything and their only conenction they have with each other is the daughter. The daughter decides to go on a trip to Europe with a friend and ends up getting kidnapped and trafficked, being sold as a prostitute to a slum lord and now the father must use of all of his acquired skills as a CIA agent and try to rescue his daughter before it is too late.<br /><br />Now while the story may be very simple, it is the action that is truly entertaining to watch. Liam Neeson may be old but he can still whoop some serious ass. His character is relentless and will kill anyone that will get in his way of saving his daughter. Liam Neesons character is pretty damn resourceful and highly intelligent, I would say that this is basically another \\"Bourne\\" type movie but with a more mature protagonist. While it may seem this character is just a murderer in every sense (I would say he kills about 30 people in this movie) its the drive that comepletly makes the viewers overlook all of the violence and just root for Liam hoping he finds his daighter in the end. This movie is action packed and I highly suggest this movie to anybody who loves fast paced action movies.

B000003TAR|2.0|I usually don't do this, but this is the first time I've listened to this album. Right off the bat, I knew that this was sonically the worst album in Nirvana's discography. Man, even the collection of unreleased tracks off of \\"Insecticide\\" beat this, at least melodically, and this review precedes that review.<br /><br />I can say that Alice in Chains' album with the 3 legged dog beats this one, even though it's supposedly depressing, but it's not as ridiculously blatant as this one.<br /><br />And then it began...I looked up the lyrics to this album after looking at a relative review. For those who don't know, I'm a lyrics person, and it seems as if people fail to take that into consideration and just get immersed in the rhythms (now that's worthy of a not helpful vote just because I'm speaking hypothetically). \\"Serve the Servants,\\" \\"Dumb,\\" \\"Pennyroyal Tea,\\" and \\"Tourette's\\" are songs that express self-dislike, which isn't good at least in my conscience. \\"Scentless Apprentice\\" expresses negligence and poignance of babies; that's depressing, and I don't like that. \\"Heart-Shaped Box,\\" a common Nirvana song, makes you think, but I don't like the idea of being trapped in any box, \\"for weeks.\\" \\"Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle\\" sounds a bit stupid (how could you miss being comfortably sad?) and could evoke Hell (Christians would kinda oppose that). If you like being illiterate, enjoy \\"Very Ape.\\" \\"Milk It\\" has a disgusting lyric. That's what, 9 songs I've maligned so far? 3 left to go. \\"Tourette's\\" for liars and \\"All Apologies\\" are for people who maybe act Emo.<br /><br />There's a couple of rhythms that you can get into, but it's not worth it.<br /><br />Overall, this album expresses, perhaps subtly, nihilism and cynicalness, but it for sure expresses to some extent depression and low self-esteem, so buy the album \\"In Utero!\\"<br /><br />Yea, that'll happen.

0451191153|5.0|The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged are excellent novels.  If you can think for yourself, make and live with your own decisions, are not manipulated by the masses or media, and believe that you control your own destiny, then this novel is a must read for you.  Howard Roark is a non-conformist.  An entrepreneur finding his place in life - his way.  The characters are great.  The story moves fast.  It is not for the simple minded.  There are many layers to the novel and it's characters.  If you only read three books in your life read: The Bible, Atlas Shrugged, and The Fountainhead in that order.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|George Lucas can kiss my butt if he thinks I'm dropping any more coin on his garbage. First three (original) movies were awesome. The last three stunk. Ep. 1 - Jar Jar and a Yoda that looked more fake than the original. Dopey kid actor and midichlorians or whatever that crap was. Oh yeah, and don't forget Darth Vader made C-3PO from a collection of junk behind his house. Ep. 2 - Looks like a Hanna Barbara cartoon and this only gets worse in hi-def. Lame love story \\"I truly, deeply love you.\\" George Lucase couldn't write his way out of a paper bag. Where is Harrison Ford when you need him? Oh yeah, and R2 can fly now and C-3PO has an interchangeable head.  Ep. 3 - Good the first time you see it, then you realize it's just more of the same crap. Padme's dying because Vader don't love her anymore. :(  Boo-frickin' whoo! And don't get me started on the remakes of the first three. George Lucas has the sense of humor of a 5 year old. \\"I decree it would be funny if Han Solo stepped on Jabba's tail.\\" Yeah, because if he is really scared of this dude, he's going to walk all over him. Makes perfect sense. If he was going to go back and screw with these, why not just give Leah bigger cans or something?

0385341679|5.0|I read through the negative press (skipped the positive) and here is what I have to say.... I have gone back and re-read the book, and I've been re-reading the first 4.  I am really impressed with the fact that this was clearly all planned out from the beginning.  I think that the \\"thought vs action\\" issue that some reviewers raised misses a key point - thinking through allows conclusions to be reached.  Action is all well and good, but how useful to the storyline would be more killing at this point?  I am really happy that there are some cliffhangers, because there's nothing else quite like this on the market, and I would love to see more in this vein from KMM.  Yes, the sex borders on erotica, but it's not as if that wasn't done in an earlier book too.  *spoiler alert*.... I agree that the romantic relationship, when it finally is consummated, gets tied up a bit rapidly and a bit too tidily, and I think there are some inconsistencies in the way the male protagonist is written - i.e. how he thinks about Mac earlier in the book - that are not fully wrapped up for me.  But I look forward to reading another book and learning more.  This series - and the final book - was a lovely twist on urban fantasy - no vampires or werewolves, interesting and deep characters, and a story with real plot development.  Better than most romances or most suspense novels.  Not perfect, but I loved it.  Perhaps KMM will tie up some of these loose ends and help resolve the Mac/male protagonist issues in a future book.  I liked that these were not stereotypical romance novel characters.  Bottom line:  read the whole series, beginning to end, and enjoy them!  It's so different, so gripping, and so worth it.

B004AHNIGM|5.0|I have no doubt I am going to sound the epitome of cliche when I say this, but Low Country Blues may just be the album Gregg Allman was born to record. It goes without saying that Allman is one of our greatest white blues singers ever, and with his new release he truly pays tribute to all of the artists that laid the groundwork for what became The Allman Brothers Band. People like Muddy Waters, B.B. King and Otis Rush.<br /><br />This is Gregg's first solo record since 1997's Searching for Simplicity, and his first ever made up of just cover tunes - well, almost. There is the \\"Midnight Rider\\" sequel he co-penned with Warren Haynes, \\"Just Another Rider.\\"<br /><br />Produced by T Bone Burnett, the album is loaded with heart felt, deep down in your soul blues like Waters' \\"I Can't Be Satisfied,\\" Rush's \\"Checking on My Baby,\\" and Junior Wells' \\"Little by Little.\\" Gregg and T-Bone managed to pick picture-perfect songs that fit the snarl and growl of the laid back one like a glove from Tiffany's.<br /><br />Burnett has a superior gift for producing, as evident in his pre-Allman body of work, but with Low Country Blues, he outdoes himself, choosing to create a record that sounds as if it could have been recorded many years ago in a small analog studio like Muscle Shoals Sound. He captures Allman at his finest on songs like Sleepy John Estes' \\"Floating Bridge,\\" which features Dr. John on piano, and \\"Devil Got My Woman,\\" one of the album's most powerful tracks.<br /><br />While Low Country Blues lacks the variety of earlier efforts like Laid Back and Searching for Simplicity, the album stands as a testament to the genre that underscores most everything brother Gregg has ever sang, deep, soulful, hell hound on my trail blues.<br /><br />-Michael Buffalo Smith<br />universalmusictribe.com
B00127RAJY|5.0|I thought that Jillian Michaels DVDs were for people who were out of shape, but I am in pretty good shape and after renting this video and trying it, I can say that it was definitely a challenge and I knew I had to buy it.  If you are in very good shape, Level 1 is not TOO challenging, but you'll still be sweating.  Levels 2 and 3 are a real challenge, and you'll be pouring sweat and burning the next day.  The video combines cardio with combination strength moves to keep your heart rate up, and Jillian switches it up so much that each 20 minute workout is over before you know it!  A great buy for my exercise DVD collection, as it has a little something for everyone, showing modifications to make exercises more or less challenging.  On Level 3, Jillian even has you doing jumping jacks with weights!  This DVD is essential for the home exerciser.
0802473156|5.0|What a wonderful book!  I wish I would have read it years ago.  It is very insightful.  Also a lot of fun to try to figure out other people's love language.
1594202842|5.0|I have lots of respect for Amy. Not only because she achieved so much while she is this involving in her daughters' lives, but also she is so confident and courageous to share her story so honestly. Anyone with an open mind can truly benefit from her book.     I raise my child the similar way as Amy does. I believe the resilience of a child, as well as where the true self-esteem comes from. But I am nowhere near Amy's intensity and high expectation. Reading her book re-affirms my belief and encourages me to do more for my kid. She has to be so loving and giving to do so much for her children.    Thank you Amy for sharing your story.
B004AOECUG|5.0|Lets get something straight! This 30th Anniversary edition is not worth the extra expense. Everything on this disc is a direct port of the older version with the exception of four 10 minute featurettes (Marty & Bobby; Raging Bull: Reflections on a Classic; Remembering Jake; Marty on Film) and a DVD. It's interesting to see Scorsese and DeNiro interact in the the first featurette but the rest is just a rehash of stuff found elswhere in the previous extras. Unless you have a real need for the DVD your not getting much for your money (The older version can be had for under 10 bucks)and the Film transfer is exactly the same.
0061726826|4.0|I don't typically review books, but since I purchased this book based on reviews alone, I figure that I should.      I came off of a Hunger Game high to read this...and I wasn't disappointed.  I really enjoyed the book. It is my first experience with Lauren Oliver's writing and I was impressed.  She transported me to another place...I loved it!  There is a lot of character development, which I like, especially when you go in knowing that you are going to be with these characters for three books.  FYI, in case you weren't already aware, this is a planned trilogy.       I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys YA fiction and who is also looking for a new \\"series\\" to get into.  My only complaint is that I have to wait until 2012 to find out what happens!
0810997827|4.0|My daughter loves to read. She read these books within few days. My daughter is in 3rd grade. However I believe these books are better suited for the middle schoolers.
030746363X|5.0|I have read the book, and have been implementing the diet, which I believe people should do *before* giving a review. I found a lot of the book helpful, especially the diet part, like one reviewer said, if I find 2 or 3 good tips in a book, I rate that a big success. I strongly believe in metrics when implementing things, so Tim's approach really resonated with me. I am a diabetic/cancer survivor and older, so plan to take in consideration my situation when implementing the diet or any advise I get, be it authors, doctors, trainers, etc. The only negative part / confusing part I saw in the book was the GA section on burning calories when exercising, I think that should be either rewritten or taken out.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|i am 14yrs old and there are a million things i could say about this book . it was amazing i couldnt put it down. a heartwarming story. First time i read a book by Emma Donoghue and al i can say is that shes a truly amazing writter.
0399156577|2.0|I borrowed this book from my daughter (who never finished it either) and was totally dissappointed. I found it boring and I thought if I just kept reading it would get better....it didn't. For me there was just to much about the dogs and the training classes etc.  I wanted more on the serial killer and more suspense, the can't put the book down kind of suspense.  I skimmed through pages and finally gave up. I can't read a book if I'm not enjoying it.  If you like reading about dogs and the search and rescue information and classes then go for it,  if your looking for a good suspenseful book...forget it.
1849162743|5.0|The entire Millenium series was excellent.  Once I started the first book, I just couldn't stop.  I would recommend the series to anyone.

B002JVWQSW|5.0|This show is hysterical! I cannot say enough about this show. I saw the very first episode and just fell in love with it. For real, if you're looking for a new show instead of the (oldd) Desperate Housewives, Greys anatomy, Gossip girl, etc etc, then give this show a shot. It's great because you can watch any episode--it doesn't have to be in chronological order at all. I bet you will love it immediately!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Is Fox out of their mind? 1:33 aspect ratio went out with hoola hoops.  SCAM SCAM SCAM. Shame,shame,shame. DO NOT BUY IT. How many times do they expect us to buy these films? I've lost count, but here it is I think: going back to VHS twice, 12 inch Laser Disk, three times, DVD twice (thanks to widescreen and the extended versions) so that's 6 on the original 3 films. How about zero stars for Star Wars in full screen?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wasn't sure about this book when I purchased it but I am glad I did. This book is excellent, great symbolism. I was engrossed in the book from the beginning. I immediately ordered the other two books of the trilogy; \\"Catching Fire\\" and \\"The Mockingjay\\". I am in the middle of the final book now and hate to know that when I finish it that it will be over. The entire triology would make for an excellent movie.
B003TML0VO|4.0|This is a commercial album, as others are saying, but there are some good covers to songs you have heard too many times in the original versions. I like Yo Yo Ma playing on \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" (which wasn't exactly a guitar classic originally-- the same goes for other tracks). There are some good versions of \\"Back in Black\\", \\"Smoke on the Water\\". \\"Riders on the Storm\\".... There are a couple of  songs I really don't want to hear at all.<br /><br />Can Santana do better? Of course, but is fun to listen to and polished.
0937381888|5.0|My wife got me this book along with a setup for Christmas and it seemed pretty simple to get started. I read the Getting Started section, went to the Home Brew Shop and brewed my first batch. Since then the book has allowed me to take a deeper look at how things work but really you don't need that info unless you want to look deeper. This really is an easy read and it does a great job of allowing the reader to get into home brewing. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the beer.
B001BNFR6W|2.0|I love Will & Grace..........<br /><br />I haven't bought this WG collection.  Based on the current review report, I don't think I can buy this product as almost every other buyer is complaining of non-working of the DVDs.<br />How can i buy this product when there are so many bad reviews about the quality of the product?<br /><br />Can anyone reply why should I buy this product?
B001BPJJ1E|5.0|Let me make this clear; I bought the DVD from Amazon UK. It was worth paying the extra shipping cost since the print is really fantastic. I am told the print on Amazon US really sucks.<br /><br />If you want to order the movie from there go to<br />http://www.amazon.co.uk/Melody-DVD-Jack-Wild/dp/B002VD5SA6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1297339615&sr=1-1<br /><br />Ok, now for my comments:<br /><br />I first saw this movie soon after I finished school and was absolutely captivated by its charming story and brilliant music. This is probably the best soundtrack the Beegees ever made and that includes Saturday Night Fever. Teach Your Children remains among my top three CSNY songs (The other two are Judy Blue Eyes and Carry On).<br /><br />I always wondered why I could never get a decent print of this movie and thanks to Canal that finally has happened. I wish they would remaster the soundtrack though, the mono track is a bit disappointing. But the picture is so sharp that I could feel my heart strings being tugged at all over again.<br /><br />Lovers of the movie will rejoice, but I think there'a a whole generation out there who would discover the movie if it was marketed cleverly.<br /><br />Finally, even after all these years, Tracy Hyde remains as lovely as she was all those years ago.<br /><br />This may not be the best movie I have ever seen but it is certainly somewhere high on my list. Viewers from India would be interested to learn that the director is an Indian.
0439023521|5.0|First of all, I usually don't write reviews, but I was so impressed with The Hunger Games I could not help but do so.    The novel is gripping, fast paced and amazingly well written. It includes action, adventure, drama, and a tinge of romance, adding up to a piece that can appeal across ages and genders.     Unlike most writers who do not take every opportunity to delve deeper, Collins goes above and beyond the reader's expectations, adding twists and turns, not for merely captivating the audience, but engaging it. As the reader sees small details turn into valuable pieces in the plot, the reader begins to realize how incredibly ingenious The Hunger Games truly is.
030746363X|5.0|Very good book for people looking for simple ways to get healthier. I'm sure the more hardcore fitness experts will find holes in the methods used but the book provides an excellent overview of diet and exercise for the everyday person.
193659451X|2.0|My review isn't about the story aspect of the book, but rather the physical quality of this edition.  It's, well, crap.  I don't know what I was expecting, but this wasn't it.  As someone else said, it looks cheap.  As if this was some new author who had her book printed independently.  And the print is miniscule.  I never complain about print, but this book is just dreadful.  Tiny print and the lines are extremely close together.      I'm supposed to be reading this for my book club, but I strongly suspect I'm going to be looking for another edition to use.  I suppose I got what I paid for; the quality of this one is just awful.
B004HWR406|2.0|This is not a good movie. It recounts events leading to the success of Facebook. There is no feeling at all, very little character construction, no photography, nor good music. It did hold my attention simply because of the fame of Facebook. I was surprised how arrogant, sexist and racist are these geeks.
B004BBDHEK|5.0|Frist of all, what you need to know before you purchase this album is that is certainly more electronic than acoustic. Don't expect major symphonic orchestrations. Also, you should probably understand that this music will be different from Yanni's previous compositions. Expect to hear new sounds! If you are a long time Yanni fan, keep an open mind because this album will grow on you.     In the past, everytime Yanni has released something new I have made the mistake of judging it based on what Yanni has created previously. I found that juxtaposing new music to the likes of Santorini, Marching Season, etc only makes my listening experience a little bad because I am trying to find that connection between the new album and his previous albums. Folks... although in more sophisticated musical analysis, there are definitely nostalgic connections made by Yanni in terms of chords and melodies, don't look for a connection!    This music is brand new and my goodness it is amazing! Yanni has done it again, using rhythmic structures and melodic textures that are so complex they appear simple to the non-trained ear. Truth of touch is amazingly catchy and you will want to have it on replay. \\"Echo of a dream\\" starts off hinting at some of Yanni's \\"old\\" style and then smoothly transitions into an easy going piece. Look out for \\"voyage\\" - this piece is certainly epic. It sounds like something that should be on a movie soundtrack. I can already see people using the second part of the song for their own music videos on youtube. \\"Can't wait\\", there are vocals - yes. But these vocals are amazing and the hook is catchy! Yanni and Arturo is a masterpiece - pure music from two talented individuals. There is more on the album! I think you will be surprised.     Yanni has once again proved why he has 35 albums that have gone gold or platinum. I suggest you buy the album and see for yourself what amazing talent Yanni has. This album is new and quite groovy... I have mine on replay!

B003YLM78K|5.0|I looked all over for this movie, which used to be a regular during the Christmas season, and couldn't find it anywhere except Amazon.  Within a few days I was watching one of my favorite Yultide movies filled with laughter, music, drama and love.  Oh, and it's Christmas in England, their customs are a bit different.
B0041PIJOE|5.0|Awesome collection of all of Elvis's recordings during the 60's. Nicely packaged, except that the cd's tend to fall out due to the way they are stacked.
0439023491|5.0|I enjoyed it and have now turned onthe rest of my family to the books cant wait for the movies.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|I won't detract any stars for the movie because it rates all 5 of the stars I've given it, and Amazon will apply this review to all versions of this movie, but I absolutely HATE the comic book feel to this Ultimate Director's Cut.  It turned a serious and well-crafted movie into a joke.  The Warriors is a classic film that stands on its own, this Ultimate Director's Cut is a travesty.<br /><br />Love The Warriors, hate the UDC.  -kd5-
B002IKLZZY|5.0|I ordered this movie along with a couple other classic movies all from Amazon. All movies were great and in perfect condition. However I was using my trial Amazon Prime experience for 2 day shipping and I was utterly disappointed. I ordered the movies on the 9th of January and they did not arrive until January 19th. I did not receive any information from amazon about problems or delays with my order. I have ordered over 15 or 20 orders from Amazon over the past year using the regular free account and never had shipping problems before. Needless to say I canceled my Amazon Prime membership and am sticking with their regular service.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|What is the line on Mary-Louise Parker's teeth????  You can see when she smiles while talking on the phone in RED, it goes horizontally across all the maxillary teeth about 1/3 of the way up the visible portion.  It is light blue.  It doesn't look like Invisalign trays, & I doubt tetracycline stain since most celebrities would just get veneers (whitening tetra. stain is expensive & unpredictable) .... any ideas?    The movie was fantastic!  Explosions, big phallic guns, physically impossible action, unbelievable escape scenarios, true love, and crazy eccentric characters made it a fun fantasy joy ride.  I'm going to buy it right now.      It's just driving us nuts trying to figure out what's on Ms. Parker's teeth!
0670033375|4.0|This book is full of interesting facts about the world we live in and issues that we as a human race need to take control of. It is very insightful and worth the readers time.
B004BJMEO6|5.0|I waited until I could get this movie on my Netflix to see it. I am so sick of being burned by poorly constructed and horribly acted lesbian movies that resemble a high school production. That being said, after finally watching this movie I can tell you that it is absolutely worth adding to any collection.<br /><br />The story is relevant and touching. The writing funny, intense, and honest. The acting is excellent, especially from Necar Zadegan and Traci Dinwiddie. And their chemistry, well that was off the chart. I can honestly say I was invested in the characters and their journey from start to finish.<br /><br />Elena Undone is what lesbian cinema should aspire to!
1582701709|5.0|Really good book. The presentation is great, hardcover and satin pages. And if you understand the content of the book, leaving all prejudices aside, you will really enjoy it.
B000FBJAOG|1.0|Seriously. This is NOT parody or humor in any way shape or form, if you are a ex marine you might actually find this book helpful as this looks like a SWAT member who likes to play Zombie games, got tired of their flaws and basically dissected it and wrote a serious manual ?!?!?! . It is not even remotely funny at all, not even for a zombie!. Please file it under a different section and refund my money.
B000RUYQ2Q|5.0|i  loved this 4x platinum lp since my late my late moms gave me this lp on one of the last widely available 8 tracks chrismas of '82. from 1999 to his first top 10 pop hit little red corvette,its prince and his band revolution @ its absolute best! this album might be slighty dated because of the then-new roger linn drum machine,its a perfect time capsale of 80s rock,pop,r&b and dance music. from armageddon fears to horniest come-ons this is an lp that is anything but boring.s&m themes in automatic,to mile high club love in international lover,this lp is also forplay for you and your partner. though this lp lost to michael jacksons classic thriller @ the feb. '84 grammys,in '08 it was put in to the grammy hall of fame. btw,ladies u will love the sexy bare backside crack of prince in his bedroom in the inner sleeve:) prince and company has got it,go get it!
B0037AGASG|5.0|Best CD Ever!!!!!!! Justin is one of the best singers, next to Taylor Swift. His music is inspiring, and since he went from being a normal kid to huge superstar so fast, it proves that anything is possible, just reach for the stars, keep dreaming and you'll go places. -Bieber4Eva-
B003XQRZ7E|5.0|I just dismissed this effort as just another \\"supergroup\\" and put it away after just one listen. I always check out everything twice if it stays in my collection plus I wanted to watch the dvd anyways. Today, I istened with an open mind and the realization that it HAD to be good with all of the talent in the band. Second time, it sunk in. Although too long at 72 minutes, the disc reeks of class. \\"One Last Soul\\", \\"The Great Divide\\" & \\"Medusa\\" are all stunning. The opener \\"Black Country\\" has a early Maiden(!) type of vibe to start it all too.<br /><br />Good bands are all but disappearing, don't let this one.
B004IM14RY|1.0|I just lost one hour and fourty minutes of my Life I will never get back :( this movie was HORRIBLE
B000EHSN9Y|1.0|This particular product works but is very spotty. I had it paired with the Amazon HDMI to HDMI cord and it would disconnect every 3 minutes, interrupting my computers connection to the television. Really annoying. I then bought a Moshi mini DVI [m] to DVI [f] and it worked perfect. Don't buy this product.
B002JVWRAO|1.0|I was So Hooked on this show; not since I was a kid did I have to watch every week. It does start out fairly well IMO but the continued struggle back & forth between Dean & the Angels just seemed to prolong the agony of what needed to be done.. It just kept going back & forth & wasting time w/what they could have been doing. And bringing in the old favorite characters & doing what the writers did, really ticked me off. I think it was definitely a cheap move. Not sure if they had planned a 6th season but why just obliterate all the supporting characters.. It was Stoopid. I collected all of the 1st four seasons but have no intention of owning the 5th & don't have a clue what happened in the 6th. They really should have went out in a blaze of glory instead of jumping the shark.  I will remember \\"The Boys\\" fondly & Loved the 4 years of Pure Entertainment they brought... Thank You Sam & Dean
0061726826|5.0|Okay, so this book has pretty much left me speechless. I literally finished like, a few minutes ago and my mind is still seriously blown.     Lena lives in a world where love is the enemy, where passion is anathema, where poetry and art have fallen by the wayside, and romantic tendencies must be put down at all costs. some seriously hardcore brainwashing helps guide young citizens through the complexities of these norms, while upon reaching their majority a more comprehensive (invasive, horrifying)  solution is offered: a procedure, not so far removed from a lobotomy, that results in a total dulling of the emotions. Recipients of this procedure feel nothing. Love, happiness, anger are null.     Lena does the unthinkable - she falls in love.     Okay, so this book has pretty much left me speechless. I literally finished like, a few minutes ago and my mind is still seriously blown. And the cliffhanger? GOD, WHY?! I need to know what happens! I also absolutely loved the way that bible stories, Shakespeare and other literature were intertwined into the narrative - either left unaltered and banned by the government for its subversiveness or altered in order to conform to the dystopian ideologies. Final verdict? 5/5. This book was utterly perfect.     \\"Love, the deadliest of all deadly things:   It kills you both when you have it, and when you don't.   But that isn't it, exactly.   The condemner and the condemned;   The executioner the blade; the last-minute reprieve;   the gasping breath and the rolling sky and the thank you, thank you, God.   Love. It will kill you and save you, both.\\"
B004G6009K|5.0|Disney's best movie in years. The characters are fantastic. The villain was completely intriguing and the music was great. Disney is definitely getting good again. :D
B004E547D8|4.0|4.3 stars<br /><br />It's good that Hollyweird is slowly realizing some of the most ingenious writers working are writing \\"comic books\\". They have been for decades, in fact, and Red makes the case for their many skills quite well. This script is excellent, with many many very funny lines and set-ups. The direction is likewise solid, and every actor here is clearly having a great time and taking none of it too seriously. Malkovich especially proves again and again that he is one of the most underrated comic actors around; between this and Burn After Reading you've got to give the guy serious props.<br /><br />We laughed a lot and were entertained throughout Red. It's nice and tight and doesn't go on too long, and in general Red is one of the more enjoyable action/comedies I've seen in a long time. The blu-ray transfer is very very crisp, and made the outstanding effects and interesting shots/angles even more fun to watch.<br /><br />If you're looking for an action-filled flick with fine acting and tongue firmly in cheek, this one is for you.
B000K7VHQE|3.0|I never laughed anywhere here, but I did somewhat enjoy the film. Really, there's no comedy, to speak of. It's a real lowball indie. Grandpa is a junkie. Junior is depressed and doesn't speak. Momma and pappa have problems. Guess who is the only normal one? Um, the 10 year old girl of the title. She's bent on performing in a beauty pageant, despite sporting a gut like a mini Hulk Hogan. No real plot to speak of, so you are left to enjoy the individual performances. Again, the little girl is the most impressive of the bunch. Worth your time, but don't be taken by all the raves. It's just so-so.
B000000W94|4.0|I am entering this after hearing of Gary's passing this week, at the age of 58.<br /><br />I feel badly that Gary was not more widely recognized for the brilliance of his playing. There were and are very, very few musicians who possess his talent. I also feel badly that so often we reduce ourselves to childish levels by placing value judgments on people, arguing incessantly that our particular guitarist or actor or ballplayer is \\"better\\", or, more often, \\"way better than your guy\\".<br /><br />Whenever I hear someone criticize a prominent musician's playing--and GM did receive criticism--I dismiss it as coming from jealousy or ignorance or childishness. Go to YouTube and watch Gary perform Walking By Myself, in a live version, and if you can find fault with his singing, his playing, his commitment, his truth, well, then you are blind as well as deaf and dumb.<br /><br />Try picking up an electric guitar and copying one of Gary's solos, any one of them, and you will see that this man was one in a million.<br /><br />On this album, GM has the eminent good sense to play tribute to the man who I consider to be one of the most brilliant blues musicians ever to pick up a guitar. Gary was inspired by Peter Green, one of the trailblazers of Brit blues, and created this album not to outdo Peter, or to show off, but more likely because he simply loved PG's renditions of these songs, and probably because he--GM--wished he could play them half as well as Peter. I suspect PG was/is proud.<br /><br />I'm guessing there is very little jealousy or animosity among these musicians. It would be interesting to hear what Peter Green has to say about Gary Moore.
B003A4IFDW|4.0|I first heard Bettye on the Kennedy Center Honors with a riveting performance of The Who's \\"Love Reign Over Me.\\"  I was spellbound by the arrangement and her approach to the words.  This album is her take on many classic songs from a rich catalogue of British artists.  The opening track, \\"The Word,\\" a Lennon and McCartney song, is an often overlooked track from Rubber Soul.  Her version has a funky R&B edge that tells you this album is not full of duplicate renderings of other artists songs.  I think the best thing Bettye does is often slow a song down and share the quality of thought the lyrics hold.  We are not overwhelmed by the music but drenched in words.  Her own voice often carries the pace and rythym of the song, which keeps you focused on what she wants to convey about it.  \\"Isn't It a Pity\\" is an arrangement I think George Harrison would be proud of.  I felt more of the sadness in the words than I honestly felt in his own quality performance.  The album as a whole is a nice listen and I hope she chooses a 2nd volume.  It would be interesting to see what other British classics bend her ear.

B0034G4OZO|5.0|It's kind of a funny story is a movie about a sixteen year old kid who has thoughts of committing suicide whom asks to be admitted into a mental hospital to get a quick fix and be on his way, but what happens is that he has to stay a minimum of five days for an evaluation so that he is not a danger to himself any longer before he is just let go. What happens is much more interesting and heart-felt though. The boy befriends another man in the mental hospital (galifianakis) and they seem to help each other out. Along with the boy seeming to help almost everyone, including an Egyptian man who doesn't get out of bed ever. The movie is very sweet and humorous never having a dull moment in my opinion. I highly recommend this film for everyone. Give it a try, it proves that Galifianakis can actualy act and is not just the funny fat guy from the hangover. He reminds me of Jack Nickleson in One Flew Over The Cookoo's nest...The one who seems the finest is usually the one with the most issues. I hope I've been helpful..<br /><br />-Cam

This is, after all, the book that turned Chuck Yeager from someone known primarily by airplane lovers to a bona fide Great American.  I remember too how it was the movie version of this book that was anticipated to launch the John Glenn presidential campaign, the progress of which had started, it was thought, on the day he volunteered for astronaut training.<br /><br />I am old enough to remember most of the events he describes, and, at least in my mind, it has captured the time and place.  There are no footnotes, but obviously a lot of interviews went into this book.  The big picture is accurate, even if he does get aircraft designations wrong (he confuses the Grumman F7F Tigercat and the Grumman F11F Tiger, and that F4H-1s became F-4Bs in 1962).  He's got other details wrong too.  But that's small stuff.<br /><br />There are remarkable descriptions that have great applicability as craft examples.  This includes the description of a deck landing in chapter 2,  or of the testffield at  Muroc in chapter 3.  Chapter 1 provides an example of how to introduce terms (pushing the envelope), the effective use of repetition (the bridge coats at the funerals),  Chapter 1 also shows the invocation of sensory details, with the smells of an airplane that has crashed in a swamp, and a description of the swamp itself.  These descriptions arise segued not from a description of the airplane that has crashed or the pilot that has been killed, but of the feelings of the spouse of a surviving pilot at the funeral of the guy who finished off in the swamp.  Such emotions are certainly a powerful opening to the book, and starting off with the wife, not with the pilot or the airplane, a non-obvious narrative approach, was used to powerful advantage.<br /><br />Chapter 11 includes a remarkable an exciting scene, with Gus Grissom in the water after his capsule had landed and a series of failures leads to the capsule sinking and him almost being drowned,  He runs through the scene effectively twice, once from the point of view of the literally more distant (and detached) rescue helicopter pilots and one from that of the closely involved, potentially drowning Grissom which reproduced what was going on inside his head.  Now, Grisson may have talked aboiut this is an interview before his tragic death in the Apollo capsule fire, or this may all be the author's surmise.  The reader does not know.  But it is done effectively.  As is the transition to the disappointment in the lack of post-launch recognition that followed the Grissom mishap.<br /><br />When Chuck Yeager stalls and spins the NF-104 in chapter 15, it was a spectacular scene.  ).to the book, and starting off with the wife, not with the pilot or the airplane, a non-obvious narrative approach, was used to powerful advantage.<br /><br />Chapter 11 includes a remarkable an exciting scene, with Gus Grissom in the water after his capsule had landed and a series of failures leads to the capsule sinking and him almost being drowned,  He runs through the scene effectively twice, once from the point of view of the literally more distant (and detached) rescue helicopter pilots and one from that of the closely involved, potentially drowning Grissom which reproduced what was going on inside his head.

B004EQAVFU|5.0|Never Let Me Go is cinematic art at its finest, a masterpiece that will be watched for decades.<br />Any empathetic person will be deeply touched and taken to an emotional state rarely achieved<br />in film.  In fact, Never Let Me Go is in a league of its own.  It is a story about love, true love<br />that comes from the soul.  The catch is that in this film, the love cannot reach fulfillment.<br />I sensed that this would be the case as the story unfolded.  However, near the end of the film,<br />(when the reason for the art gallery is revealed) I was quite surprised and instantly reduced<br />to a sobbing mass.  But this brings home the film's main point.  While this is an overwhelmingly<br />sad film, it affirms that the capacity to love is the the defining characteristic of being human.<br />See this movie - it is miraculous.<br /><br />Additional comments made on 5/8/2012 DON'T read before seeing the movie!<br />My take on the general topic of the film:  This film is about personal discrimination - one subset of society treating another subset as less than human, and the suffering that discrimination causes.<br />Just as much real world discrimination is subtle, some of the discrimination in this movie's world is also subtle.  But the point made crystal clear near the film's end is that those who are guilty of the discrimination believe they are doing good for society as a whole.  (Miss Emily's statements to Tommy and Kathy made when the latter two are requesting a deferral.)  Compounding this extremely sad situation is that Madam Claude follows on with a comment (that I can't remember exactly) that indicates her emotional detachment. However, when Tommy and Kathy leave, she does say \\"you poor creatures\\".  This shows some sympathy for their (the donor's) situation,<br />but also shows her belief that they are less than human.  I have never seen a movie with commentary this powerful.
1847879071|4.0|This text has been an excellent resource for me. I have used SPSS for a couple of projects prior to purchasing this book, and I wish I had the text before doing those projects. The explanations for the statistics as well as how to use the SPSS program are clear.     The reason I did not give this book a 5 is because at times I just needed an explanation of a specific statistic or procedure for getting the statistic. With the layout of the material it was difficult to just scan the page and find the information I needed. I imagine that as a required textbook for a class the lively discussion of examples (sex, drugs, and rock and roll) would be entertaining and help make the use of statistics meaningful for students; however,  it is a bit cumbersome as a resource text for quickly looking up the information you need.     I like that the text provides the a rating system for each section of content to let you know the general audience for each section (level 1 for undergrads in a first year statistics course, level 2 for 2nd year statistics students, level 3 for more advanced users).     The companion website for this text is excellent. I wish that the faculty resources were available to everyone. I understand why they aren't, but I'm not a student taking classes, I got the book to learn information; so, having access to the additional material would be helpful for me. I highly recommend going to the companion site to review the videos (some of the older ones are difficult to follow because you can't see the powerpoint slides. The newer videos do not have that problem.) and other resources.     Overall, this text was well worth my money.
B001AQMBHI|5.0|The Final Destination Series is a successful horror series. It is one of those series that will probably continue making sequels (FD5 is supposed to release in Summer 2011). Well, I love the Final Destination series, they are entertaining - not very scary, but the deaths are very interesting. I personally favor the 3rd and 1st movie, while 2 and 4 are my least favorite - but I still like them! Well, I was shopping in this DVD store that is closing down and they had \\"Final Destination 1\\" on Blu-Ray for $12.99 with an 80% off discount. The Blu-Ray was only $2.50 in the end. The Blu-Ray is the Canadian edition, but it's exactly the same as the USA Blu-Ray release - same special features, ect. The only difference is that it has 18A instead of an R-Rating.<br /><br />DVD review:<br />The quality is excellent (for an older DVD release). The movie is enjoyable and fun to watch. There's two different kinds of packaging. One is a Snapper (I believe it includes both Widescreen & Fullscreen), the other is a Widescreen Standard DVD case. In the end, it's a great movie - with lots of special features.<br /><br />Blu-Ray Review:<br />The quality is pretty good (better than the DVD). The Blu-Ray has grain as well.
0891419063|5.0|I read this book after watching HBO's \\"The Pacific\\" - and its is really a great and well written book. If you've watched the tv series, you will be happy to be able to correlate and get more info on the exact scenes from the mini-series.<br /><br />As for the book, Sledge really puts the battles right in your reading space. The life of an infantry marine, the gruesome encounters with the Japanese, the weather conditions, the funny and sad memories, everything is so descriptively depicted.<br /><br />As a 22 yr old optometry student (with not much knowledge of the Pacific War battles) - this book is very enlightening and easy to read for anyone. Highly recommend to gain more knowledge on what the soldiers actually experienced in the battles of Peleliu and Okinawa.
B000JQUZCI|5.0|Frankenstein the book is much better than all of the movies. I read it in my teens and am now re-reading it as an adult, I find that it gets better every time you read it. Be aware that the Kindle version lacks a table of contents with links. Also it is very easy to miss chapter headings. Having said that, this book is highly readable if you only want to read from start to finish.
0439023521|4.0|After giving \\"The Hunger Games\\" to a teenager and hearing rave reviews from him, I bought a copy for myself and stayed up all night to finish it. While elements of the story feel familiar--you'll hear echoes of Shirley Jackson's The Lottery, Battle Royale, The Running Man, Lord of the Flies, and even The Truman Show--the main character, Katniss, is original and compelling. Suzanne Collins manages to make this teenager as vulnerable and sympathetic as she is tough and pragmatic, even when she is forced to kill. The violence isn't as horrifying as it could have been, as Collins doesn't linger on description, but of course, this is YA. While not terrifying, it's definitely suspenseful (and it may very well be terrifying to younger readers).<br /><br />My criticisms of the book are minimal. The main characters' reactions to the violence (particularly violence at their own hands) are sometimes inconsistent or underdeveloped, and it's hard to believe Katniss is so clueless about romance (16-year-olds do have hormones, after all). Also, the science aspect is weak; inventions in this future are of the Jetson's sort, and the animal mutations that torment the contestants in the Hunger Games are too absurd to be scary. But this is a story of survival and humanity, not science, and mine are the complaints of an analytical grad student who nonetheless enjoyed the book. A teenager is sure to be less critical, and even more enthralled with Katniss's struggle.

I mean, we DO to live in a world dominated by time. As much as time is a human concept, we are HUMANS!<br />I like the idea, I meditate myself, and it brings me great peace, but I can't meditate all day every day and expect to have any kind of a life in the material world. And yes, I get it that material things are bad and enlightenment is good, but again, we live in a material world! Whether we can see beyond that or not, our NOW, is in the material world, and if we can't function here, NOW, then what's the point to any of it?<br />I liked the book for the authors ability to answer questions as they arose in my head, and that he has found this peace in the NOW.<br /><br />I hope to acheive this myself, and I do practice the teachings when TIME allows, but then, maybe I'm missing the point?...
B0034G4OZE|5.0|Over the past 3 months I have watched 2 movies per day.  Kind of bad habit, but also a great one.  Anyway, this movie combines the artistic elements of Science of Sleep to bring you into an imaginative and whimsical state of mind.  It follows a quirky teenage kid, who is overly stressed and kind of dorky, in the line of Gordon-Levitt in 500 days of summer, while being set in a psychiatric wing of a hospital, a la Girl Interrupted.  Bottom Line: a nice feel good movie that doesn't follow the traditional track work of a sappy love story.

As another reviewer says, this is one that will - sooner or later - take the United States by storm.
0545123275|3.0|After hearing this book praised over and over as \\"wonderful, romantic, great werewolf fiction\\" I confess I'm not sure what I expected. I haven't read too many YA books, but I have read a lot of werewolf books and many romance novels. This book is decent but it wouldn't make my top ten list in either category.<br /><br />The premise is simple: As a young girl Grace is attacked by wolves and would likely have been killed, but one wolf saved her. That same wolf, Sam, continues to visit her in here backyard every winter. After years pass, Same and Grace at last encounter each other when Sam is human. Grace is delighted to learn that Sam and her wolf friend are one and the same, and the two instantly begin to develope romantic feelings. Sam explains that his change into a wolf is triggered by cold, which is why he is a wolf during the winter. More importantly, as the years pass changing into a human becomes more and more difficult until one year, you stop changing and remain a wolf forever. Same is fairly certain that this year is his last, and that when he changes it will mean leaving Grace forever.<br /><br />Grace's parents are so neglectant they make the Rugrats' parents look downright attentive. She is utterly self-sufficient. They show little interest in her, which is what makes it possible for her to spend so much time with Sam. Not far into the story she has him sleeping in her bed on a nightly basis. This annoyed me because I found myself thinking, this could easily be an adult heroine--perhaps a college student. Grace is devoid of most of the teenage issues I recall from being seventeen--which would include concerned parents, learning to balance responsibilities, still trying to shed the last bits of immaturity and awkwardness. The only reason to write her as seventeen was so the book could be sold to the seventeen and under crowd.<br /><br />Sam is pretty much on his own as well, although he is eighteen at least. It struck me that he seems the one to be in the more atypical teenage stage of questioning who he is and what his place in the world should be. He even has a moment of harsh reality when he realizes his parental figure isn't as nobel as he'd once assumed.<br /><br />Grace is characterized as practical to a fault. Sam, on the other hand, has an artistic and emotional personality. The contrast was very well written. As their relationship builds, you see them both grow appreciate the other side of the spectrum and develope because of it. The romance was the part of the book I most enjoyed, and the reason I am able to give it three 1/2 stars instead of two.<br /><br />The mythology sucks. I'm sorry, there are some ok ideas, but in the end it's just bad. The central issue is that cold makes werewolves change into wolf form, and eventually they won't be able to come back. And no, moving to the tropics apparently won't work (some of the wolves tried it. kind of). This makes no sense, other then the fact that the author needed to throw up a road block for her couple. There is no reason why a very determined werewolf couldn't hole up in a non-airconditioned building in Florida for six months out of the year and avoid refridgerators. Or wear ten layers during winter. Something. And then they come up with a cure for werewolfism which basically involves inducing a fever, but the explanation as to why that might work is pretty week. I'm willing to suspend disbelief, but I need some kind of reasonable logic other then cold=wolf hot=human. But sadly the author could not be bothered.<br /><br />Anyway, in the end you get a melancholy story with a reasonably happy ending. I liked Sam and Grace, and I found their love believable. The fact that I didn't find the world building enjoyable may mean that I won't read anymore of Miss Stievater's books, but I'd recommend Shiver. 3.5 stars.stage of questioning who he is and what his place in the world should be.

B002T9H2LA|1.0|This story is pure fantasy.  With all the touching true stories to come out of World War II, why does a movie producer sink to such a level to supply entertainment?  It seems to have been made simply to exploit Hollywood's talent for exhibiting gore.  There are no heroes or \\"good guys\\" here.  I honestly can't find any redeeming value about this picture.  With movie themes like this dumped on our public, criminals have a generous supply of role models to imitate.  Wish I could get my money back.<br />This movie is not worth one star but Amazon doesen't allow a zero rating, so....one star it is!
055380684X|4.0|What is talent?  How is it achieved?  Are those who have it somehow blessed by the gods, while the rest of can only hope to some day achieve a mere fraction of what the talented do? NO!  Wrong, barracuda breath!  According to Coyle \\"skill is myelin insulation that wraps neural circuits and that grows according to certain signals.\\"   That's what I told my kid the next time he wanted me to teach him something.  He walked away muttering something about daddy being a retard.  Anyway, enough about me.    Daniel Coyle claims, and as a good journalist backs it up with quotes from scientists, that skill (talent) basically boils down to brain circuits being strengthened whenever you try something new.  This strengthening, ironically, occurs as you make errors.  Our neurology is set up to respond to error correction and strengthen those new path signals.  The more you try, fail and correct, the better you get at what you're doing.  This Coyle refers to as deep practice.    The other key to developing talent is motivation, and motivation can be triggered by different factors.  He gives as an example the fact that many big achievers lost a parent early in life. They responded at an evolutionary-biological level to the threat of being on their own by achieving great things.  I'm not so sure I buy this part since many in the same situation respond by never taking risks, which is a key to achieving great things.  He provides other examples of motivation, like Andruw Jones success in the 1996 World Series, which led to a phenomenal growth in Little League baseball in the small island of Curacao and big wins in the Little League World Series.  In other words, motivation can come from seeing someone you identify with achieve something big.  I suppose if I see a middle-aged fat guy scoring with Cameron Diaz, I would get motivated.    The final key to the code is having a great coach or teacher.  This teacher uses deep practice and motivational techniques to get you going.  They do notuse a one-size-fits-all approach, but rather customize their coaching to each student's needs.  These coaches don;t need to be some legendary people - the Lombardis or Woodens et al - but rather anyone who uses the coaching principles mentioned.    So there you have it, if you want yourself or your kid to achieve something outstanding in their field, follow this three step prescription.

B0042LJTQO|5.0|Legendary pianist Alfred Brendel celebrated his 80th anniversary on 5 January 2011. What a more fitting present could he offer his aficionados on that occasion than a hallmark set of recordings from his vast legacy - namely the one devoted to Schubert's piano works (written during 1822-1828)? Inspired and deeply respectful, DECCA followed the public sympathy for Brendel and decided to honor this great artist of our time by reissuing these wonderful recordings. And not hesitating to announce some new releases for this winter: live captures from concerts of the aged Alfred Brendel (Brahms, Mozart).<br /><br />No less than nine Sonatas, Moments musicaux, complete Impromptus, German Dances, Hungarian melody and other pieces, along with the mighty \\"Wanderer\\" fantasy are lined up in 7 CDs recorded within a few months at the end of 1980s. Schubert has for long been a close musical friend of Brendel. The graceful style - though unfolding at times deep passions and hard tensions - along with a subtle sense of melody and a crystal-clear finger-work are the features that singled out this very special musician, so suitable for the Viennese classicism. Brendel has been always craving for clarity and poise, seeking in his performances the truths of the scores, the very intentions of the composers. Everything has to make sense in Brendel's playing. Everything has to touch the soul of the listener in an elegant manner. Yet inner coherence of the piece and its logical substance are mandatory.<br /><br />His mature reading here proves a keen insight in Schubert's music highlighting an otherworldly delicacy. Harsh accents are carefully avoided. Lyrical dimension is potentiated al the time, whilst even the bleak anguish of the last sonatas gains a serene light. What a controlled firework in the \\"Wanderer\\" fantasy! How precisely and charmingly the tender side comes out from the impromptus!<br /><br />What a more proper present could we offer Alfred Brendel on his anniversary than our loving thought for him, a deep bow for his presence in music, and the nostalgic regret that he decided in December 2008 to stop concertizing? So that from then on the unique flavor of his unmatched music-making can marvel us only from his recordings.

0307473465|3.0|The book is divided roughly into three sections. The first is the encounter of the main character (Michael Berg) with the seducing woman (Hanna) and the subsequent readings; the second is his witnessing of her trail or what was behind the true nature of the woman who seduced him; and the last - takes place several years after his readings to Hanna when she is close to concluding her term of imprisonment.<br /><br />The first part is the strongest and most interesting as Michael attempts to explore the nature of his relationship to Hanna. I found the second part with its description of Hanna's performance at the trial to be very distant - almost like he didn't want to visualize her true nature and what she was capable of doing. Was this a metaphor for how Nazi Germany is viewed by Germans today?<br /><br />There is an initial intoxication with the erotic encounters; but after, the evil is viewed from afar. The trial is like a series of words that one reads through a telescope; as if these events did not happen from the same people and geography.<br /><br />The continued readings to Hanna could be interpreted as an attempt to educate her - to remove her from the Nazi past.<br /><br />I found the movie (of the same title) much more emotional; it added needed feeling to the raw complexity of the story.
0307454541|5.0|I'm 3 years behind reading this book but what a great novel.  I was slightly bored the first 100 pages as the background was laid for the story but from then on I could not put it down.  Well written, lots of twists and surprises, with an ending that will make you pick up the second book in the trilogy immediately.  Lisbeth Salander is the best new character I've come across in years, I was cheering for her by the end of the book.  It takes a few pages to adapt to the Swedish cadence, and some of the expressions bout well worth it. This is a great read.<br />I took a chance and put all 3 novels on my kindle and after reading the first it was a great decision.  Buy it and read it, you won't be disappointed.

B001RIY4WE|5.0|This review is not about the movie itself or the special features on the blu-ray disc - there are many other reviwes who already covered that part. For that I gave the movie the rating of 5 stars.    This review is about technical issues some users and reviewers seem to have (which included myself)    I think I figured out what the issue with the disc not playing on certain blu-ray disc players is - here we go:    First let me explain that several movie companies (Warner Bros., Paramount, Universal, ... etc.) at times offer a feature on their blu-ray discs which is called \\"BD Live\\".  BD Live is a special feature which offers additional online content, accessible from the Internet through your Blu-Ray Disc Player.  Usually this feature is optional and you can access it through the Special Features section on the disc or it has its own category on the disc menue.    However it means that your Blue Ray Disc Player needs to be \\"BD Live ready\\" to be able to access that content. So the first thing to check is if the blu-ray disc player you own has the \\"BD Live readiness\\"!    Well, my blu-ray disc player is a Vizio and does offer BD Live - so far so good. However when I tried accessing the BD Live feature on various blu-ray discs (e.g. 'Sherlock Holmes', 'Terminator:Salvation') I always got a message from my player stating \\"no storage media available\\"...    It took me over three months (until yesterday) to figure out that the error message practically meant that I have to put a Flash drive in the USB port of my Vizio blu-ray disc player.    Once I had put a 2 GB flash drive in the USB slot the BD Live feature of my 'Terminator Salvation' Blue Ray disc worked.   And be warned: It takes minutes for the features to download from the Internet if you have a slow Internet connection like I do (DSL)    After I was successful in getting the BD Live option to work I returned to my T2 disc, which refused to play in the past and simply locked up my player, ready to give it another try.  Voila! This time the disc played and the features are really awesome and stunning!    So the crux with the T2 Skynet Edition is that usually the BD Live feature is OPTIONAL (which makes sense, since not all blu-ray disc players offer the BD Live access), but in the case of the T2 disc the BD Live feature is MANDATORY!    This means your blu-ray Disc Player needs to have two things for the disc to work (= play):    1) The Player needs to have the BD Live readiness    2) The Player needs to have a storage device (such as a flash drive) connected to the USB port. (I don't know if there are possibly players on the market that have storage space internally, mine doesn't)    If you don't have both features your disc simply won't play, which is a shame and a stupid concept on the part of Warner Bros. They should have made the BD Live content optional or at least offer a bypass option.    This is my theory gotten out of my personal experience and I hope it is helpful for buyers of the blu-ray disc to avoid frustration over the issue!

030745455X|4.0|I loved this novel.  I do have to warn you, though, that you should buy both the second an third novel together, because you will want to read it immediately.<br />The characters are surprisingly easy to relate to most of the time, and seem to be one of the most realistic characters of today's novels.  Once you think that you have a grip on the mystery, Stieg Larsson throws in another curve ball.  The story is slightly confusing if you don't have knowledge of Swedish geography, but not too much so that you can't follow it.<br />The only reason that I gave it four instead of five stars is because of the giant cliffhanger at the end.  The ending made me want to snap my Kindle in half out of frustration.  It does, however, set up the next book quite well, thus the recommendation to get both at once.

081297381X|2.0|To get to the substance of \\"The Black Swan,\\" you must first get beyond the author's overweening self-regard.  But when you have done that--if indeed you can--you find there is very little substance after all.  Much of the book is little more than the author's confession of worldliness and refinement.  We are guided to understand that he is at once immersed in man's strife-torn existence (\\"This is not an autobiography, so I will skip the scenes of war\\") and steeped in les belles lettres (\\"My point, I repeat, is not that Balzac is untalented, but that he is less uniquely talented than we think\\").  What arguments he makes regarding \\"black swans\\"--rare events with outsized impact--are mostly arguments of assertion rather than demonstration, and what insights he provides into the nature of these events are far from profound.  In most cases they are but a short distance removed from common sense.<br /><br />Nonetheless, some readers may enjoy the spectacle of a grown man displaying the sort of braggadocio not normally seen in males above age fourteen.  It is lowbrow entertainment to watch the pompous make asses of themselves, but it is still entertainment.  And pomposity is in every chapter of the book.  Do you have any idea how many world cities Nassim Nicholas Taleb sips coffee in?  No?  Voila, he will tell you!  New York, Beirut, Lugano, Rome, Paris, Athens, Venice, Sydney, and many more!  \\"I was transiting through the Frankfurt airport on my way from Oslo to Zurich.  I had time to kill and it was a great opportunity for me to buy dark European chocolate....\\"<br /><br />Or, do you know how many languages Nassim Nicholas Taleb speaks?  No?  Voici, he will tell you this too!  French, Arabic, English....  Alas, his Italian is weak, so he augments it with hand gestures.  And Latin:  \\"I am carrying Seneca on all my travels, in the original, as I relearned Latin--reading him in English did not feel right. It would be equivalent to reading Yeats in Swahili.\\"  The author's only nod to modesty here is that he did not then claim to have actually read Yeats in Swahili.<br /><br />Taleb's erudition in language is at the heart of one of the most egotistically comical paragraphs of the book.  During a meeting with his close friend, Benoit Mandelbrot, Taleb recounts that,<br /><br />\\"Mandelbrot mentioned one of his friends, the aristocratic mathematician Marcel-Paul Schutzenberger [who] insisted on the clear cut distinction in the French language between `hasard' and `fortuit.' We went to the Petit Robert dictionary. `Fortuit' seems to correspond to my epistemic opacity, `l'imprevu et non quantifiable'; `hasard' to the more ludic type of uncertainty that was proposed by the Chevalier de Mere in the early gambling literature.  Remarkably, the Arabs may have introduced another word ....\\"<br /><br />If you had a Petit Robert yourself, you might be tempted to look up \\"poseur.\\"<br /><br />Oh, yes, the substance.  These \\"black swans\\" are statistical outliers, and thus invite a discussion of statistical modeling and its application to the real world.  This the author provides, sort of, in chapters 15-17.  Here he proposes to be technical (\\"The nontechnical reader can skip this chapter...,\\" he helpfully cautions), maybe even mathematical.  But beyond the not very surprising demonstration that the tail of a bell curve becomes miniscule more quickly than that of a power-law curve of modest degree, there is little in here that passes for analysis.  There is a discursion into the fractal geometry of Mandelbrot, however, and a none-too-clear assertion that power-law distributions are scalable (true) and therefore \\"Mandelbrotian\\" (I suppose so).  All this might make sense on some level, but it is not a demonstration of the superiority of power laws or the inferiority of the bell curve.  It seems rather to be a flattering tribute to his friend Mandlebrot.<br /><br />In chapter 17 the knives come out.  Here Taleb takes on \\"Locke's Madmen,\\" those benighted economists who at some point foolishly used the bell curve in their modeling and analysis.  These include Paul Samuelson.  Of him and three other notables Taleb says, \\"All four were Nobeled.  All four were in a delusional state under the effect of mathematics....\\"  I'm quite certain that Taleb knows more about economics than I do.  I am even more certain that Samuelson does.  To me this is an intra-disciplinary feud, which, at bottom, seems to be the reason for the book.  It is the rant of an iconoclast against orthodoxy.<br /><br />The book is not without value.  There are very sensible observations on the inability of most gamblers to realistically imagine the odds against them, for example, the unintended consequences of government regulation, and the wisdom of not permitting economic entities to become \\"too big to fail.\\"  There are practical illustrations of statistics that do not fit the bell curve:  distribution of income, for example.  There are also a number of bons mots scattered throughout the book:  calling egalitarianism \\"the glorification of mediocrity,\\" and observing that \\"Forecasting by bureaucrats tends to be used for anxiety relief rather than for adequate policy making.\\"  But it is doubtful that the discovery of these baubles, whatever their value as wisdom or amusement, is worth wading through the rest of Mediocristan.curve in their modeling and analysis.

0060765488|5.0|I grew up attending a private, Christian school and I was convinced that I had heard this story, and read it, enough times. I finally picked the book back up and was surprised how much I had forgotten and how many things I never picked up on before.<br /><br />This is a great book for all ages. For children, the story of Christ is presented in such a way that is easy to relate with and understand. For adults, C.S. Lewis has insights about who God is and how He relates to the world that will open your mind and heart. Using metaphor as a means to describe who God really is has fallen out of use, but it is a tool that can sneak around the most guarded defenses and penetrate souls better than any other.<br /><br />As I started the series again this time, I realized that the death and resurrection story would start the series. Many fantasy series contain this element, but normally as the climax to the series. Lewis includes it at the beginning. I don't know why he wrote the series this way, but I suspect it is because it reflects our own lives. The first thing we must learn about is Christ and his death and resurrection and saving power. Then we learn how God moved in the world before Christ, after Christ, and how He is moving now in our own lives. For that reason, even though I'm not done with the series yet, I like how Lewis starts with this story.<br /><br />One of my favorite quotes is from this book, and it was great to read it in the full context again.<br /><br />\\"He'll be coming and going. One day you'll see him and another you won't. He doesn't like being tied down-and of course he has other countries to attend to. It's quite all right. He'll often drop in. Only you mustn't press him. He's wild, you know. Not like a tame lion.\\"<br /><br />This is well worth reading again if you have not read it recently, no matter your age. It is a short, quick read and won't take you long at all to finish, but will stay with you long after you are done.

0312600844|4.0|This is a difficult book to review.  It was so well written.  One cannot deny that Jonathan Franzen can construct a sentence, and can tell a story.  But if someone asks if it was 'good'. . . how does one choose 'good'?<br /><br />It was not pleasant.  That, I can say clearly.  It was, at times, so difficult to read.  But it was real.  The characters were people I know, people I'm related to, and sometimes, they were myself.  But often, it was the blue side of them, the dark side, the hidden side.  The side we don't want to acknowledge or have shown the light of day.  Even in the bleak persepctive, I found this book fascinating and somewhat compelling.  Yes, I would say it was 'good'; I would even say it was great.  I give it four stars rather than five because at times it was just a little preachy, but I still loved it.<br /><br />Several people have said it is not as good as Franzen's earlier book, The Corrections, and I can't comment on that--I haven't read it.  But I will say, that's not a completely fair thing to do to an author.  Each book should stand on its own, shouldn't it?  I understand The Corrections has more humor, and Freedom is not burdened with humor, but perhaps each reflects a different time in the writer's life, or is asking us to hearken to different tunes in our selves. . .?  I'm not sure.  I like humor as well as the next reader, but I don't think it belonged in this book.  This book was not meant to be cute or fun--it was meant to be honest.<br /><br />It's an honest portrayal of lifelong relationships, how they change, how those in them change.  It exposes hidden agendas, hidden dreams, how a decision at one point in a life can have ramifications in another.  The book was truly about freedom, and in at least a dozen instances freedom is discussed in vastly different ways.  But I think more than all the blatant freedoms discussed, the book is about the freedom to forgive ourselves who we were, and the decisions we made in a time before, and the freedom to become who we are, and forgive the mistakes we're sure to make in the future.o we are, and forgive the mistakes we're sure to make in the future.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|WARNING: Some spoilers ahead regarding the exposure of flaws and mistakes in the movie.<br /><br />John Carpenter's Halloween (1978)...really, what else can be said? It's one of the elite classics of the horror genre. It's well written, well filmed, scary, suspenseful, dark, shadowy, spooky, and has a classic memorable creepy musical score performed by John Carpenter himself. Did I mention it's an independent, low budget film? It was made for just $320,000, but grossed upwards of $60 million worldwide. This movie really single-handedly revived interest in horror movies in the late `70s and started a horror movie making frenzy that continued for many years to come. I like to think of the late `70s and early `80s as \\"The Golden Age of Horror Movies.\\" Four years earlier Black Christmas (1974) was a huge hit, but Carpenter's movie stands out as being a trailblazing movie that paved the way for future horror movies and even horror movie franchises with invincible villains, such as Friday The 13th (Jason Voorhees) and A Nightmare On Elm Street (Freddy Krueger).<br /><br />One of the strengths of Halloween is not showing the monster too much. Michael Myers is just as effective off camera as he is on camera and his playful side is just as effective as his murderous side. John Carpenter and Debra Hill were influenced by such movies as Carnival of Souls (1962), the Alfred Hitchcock movies, particularly Psycho (1960), and Black Christmas (1974). Even the movie Chinatown (1974) was influential. Hitchcock always felt that \\"less is more\\" - it's what you don't see that is so scary. When it comes to Carnival of Souls, the ghoul (played by director Herk Harvey) frequently appears in windows and then disappears. Michael Myers does the same thing in Halloween. I also think to a certain extent that Carpenter was influenced by Star Wars (1977) when it comes to hearing Michael Myers breathing inside his mask, much like Darth Vader did in Star Wars a year earlier.<br /><br />This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat. You know someone is out there waiting to strike, but you don't know when. The daytime footage is equally as effective as the nighttime footage. Why? I think the scary music gives the daytime footage a feeling of impending doom, like something is going to happen later on. The opening credits with the camera slowly zooming in on the jack-o-lantern is one of my favorite parts of the movie. It's the perfect way to start the movie. It tells the viewer that it's Halloween, it's dark and spooky, and something is out there, but you'll have to watch to find out.<br /><br />The acting overall is pretty darn good. I think Donald Pleasence, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Charles Cyphers are the best, but Nancy Loomis, P.J. Soles, and Nick Castle give splendid performances as well. This movie is not without its flaws. In fact, it has many flaws, mistakes, and \\"bloopers\\", if you will. But these things can be overlooked because of the overall effectiveness and goal of the movie itself, which is to scare the audience.<br /><br />Just for fun, I'd like to point out some of the flaws, mistakes, and bloopers. These things don't take away from the effectiveness of the movie, but it's fun observing these things. Some of these things were pointed out by John Carpenter in the audio commentary. I also have a few questions. Here it goes:<br /><br />If this is Haddonfield, Illinois in late October, why are there green leaves on the trees? (I realize the movie was filmed in southern California in May, but still it's fun to point this out)<br /><br />In the scene where Annie and Laurie are walking home from school and Michael Myers is standing by the hedges, based on the sun's position, it looks like it's late afternoon, then a short time later when Laurie bumps into Sheriff Brackett it looks like it's early afternoon. Then the next scene, as Laurie continues to walk home, it's a cloudy day and the pavement is wet after a rainfall. Then when Laurie sees Michael Myers by the clothesline, it's sunny.<br /><br />When Lindsey Wallace answers the phone, you can see a shadow of a person behind the couch rigging the phone to ring.<br /><br />After Annie says, \\"Poor Laurie, scared another one away,\\" if you look at the house in the background as Laurie and Annie start walking, you can see people suddenly stand up on the porch. Either these people were residents or were part of the film crew.<br /><br />When Annie says, \\"He wants to take you out tonight,\\" there is cigarette smoke that floats across the screen.<br /><br />Since when does a high school in Illinois have outdoor lockers?<br /><br />Since when do hardware stores sell Halloween masks?<br /><br />When Sam Loomis exits the nut house, the welcome mat says \\"La Vina\\" which is obviously California.<br /><br />Palm trees can be seen frequently throughout the movie, including right in front of the Myers house, in the distance in several scenes, and FAR in the distance during the drive at sunset (the Ben Tramer scene).<br /><br />If this is Illinois, why are there mountains in the background when Sam Loomis is at the phone booth?<br /><br />In the phone booth scene, a train approachs. Then the next scene you hear the train, but don't see it.<br /><br />When Laurie and Annie are driving, it's sunset, then the next scene it's pitch dark. They weren't on the road long enough for it to go from daylight to darkness so quickly.<br /><br />At the beginning of the movie, the clock inside the Myers house shows different times in different scenes.<br /><br />Why carve a jack-o-lantern on Halloween night right in the middle of trick-or-treating?<br /><br />Why don't any trick-or-treaters visit the Doyle house? I know there's no jack-o-lantern on their porch, but still...<br /><br />Why don't trick-or-treaters visit the Wallace house?<br /><br />Don't Tommy Doyle and Lindsey Wallace want to go trick-or-treating? Either Annie or Laurie could take them if they wanted to go.<br /><br />In Illinois, there wouldn't be an outdoor laundry room.<br /><br />In the laundry room, the lights don't work, but the washer and dryer work.<br /><br />In the kitchen Annie has grey panties on. When's she's stuck in the laundry room, she's wearing flower-patterned panties.<br /><br />Annie can't get into the car because the car door is locked. She goes back in the house to get the car keys. She goes back to the car, and instead of using the key to unlock the door, she just opens the door. The whole point of going in the house was to get the car keys so she could unlock the door!<br /><br />Bob's van has California license plates.<br /><br />Linda and Bob use Mr. & Mrs. Wallace's bed, and even smoke while in it.<br /><br />How can a knife support the weight of a person hanging on a wall?<br /><br />The jack-o-lantern on the Wallace's porch is different scene to scene.<br /><br />If it's October in Illinois, why are there flowers blooming in the Wallace's backyard?<br /><br />I know this is just a fictional movie, but just for fun and for the record, the moon did not shine on October 31, 1978.

0385738757|5.0|* May Contain Spoilers For Those Who Have Not Read The Maze Runner.*<br /><br />Wow. That is all I can say about this sequel to the wonderful Maze Runner. Our favorite characters are thrown straight back into fighting for their lives. We knew from the end of The Maze Runner that they wouldn't be given more than a moment of safety. They are going outside; where they have not been in many years. This is not a planned maze. The maze is a shelter in comparison. The world has been taken over by a sun that will burn you within a moment spent in its rays and thunderstorms that will tear your body to pieces. People are losing their minds and becoming careless zombies. Will the Gladers lose theirs?<br /><br />There is a lot more I want to say, particularly about Theresa and other new characters, but I don't want to spoil anything for anyone who has yet to read this. James Dashner is a wonderful writer. He creates a world with his words that sucks you in, holds you there and forces you to ask questions. I read recently on James Dashner's blog that he was a LOST fan and why am I not surprised? If you hate being given mysteries without many answers (yet) then I advise you to look for a new book. James is keeping us on the edge of our seats until the third and final book in the trilogy is released later this year. I have to wonder, with so many questions left to answer, will he come through in the end?

True that he had a 'parallel' career (not 'subsequent career') in rock and roll.  But his vocal decline really were accountable for singing rather frequently at the MET since the early 1980's those Wagnerian operas that really were meant for a operatic theatre in the size of Bayreuth.<br />Peter Hofmann's voice is truly mellifluous. Wagner himself maintained that a 'bel canto' style should be the correct approach for his 'heroes'. Hofmann's Wagnerian interpretations really lived up to this standard.<br />Here is one of Hofmann's signature roles - Parsifal.  He rose to fame at Bayreuth through this role in the late 1970's.<br />This recording made in 1980 really caught Hofmann in his prime. His characterisation is ultra-fine and his articulation simply mesmerising. Each word, each syllable, were so finely rendered and set to such great musical sensibility that it is pure pleasure listening (just listening) to his Parsifal.  In the earlier Acts his portrayal was more youthful and naive, while in the last Act, upon attaining full spiritual 'awareness', he succeeded strikingly in transforming his Parsifal into heroic status.<br />It is indeed regrettable that there is no video recording of Hofmann in this signature role of his!<br />The other leads in the cast apart from the title role are also wonderful.<br />Kurt Moll's Gurnemanz is fully convincing.  While not as beautifully articulated as Hofmann's Parsifal, Moll's characterisation of the 'senior knight' is equally outstanding, and his bass voice has just that right amount of heft and gravity as well as wisdom and authority for this important role.<br />Siegmund Nimsgern's Klingsor and Dunja Vejzovic's Kundry are both outstandingly dramatic. Vejzovic is appropriately vehement, girlish and seductive at the various dramatic points.  Her versatility more than made up for any possible lack of vocal 'lustre'(if there be any such).  Nimsgern succeeds brilliantly in painting an ambitious and evil Klingsor.<br />Last but in no way the least are the father and son of Victor von Halem's Titurel and Jose van Dam's Amfortas.  Van Dam in particular mustered a truly vivid vocal picture of the Amfortas, beset with misfortune and struggling against ill-fate with true human weaknesses.<br />The Berlin Philharmonic under Herbert von Karajan, with a grand cast of minor soloists and chorus succeeded brilliantly in presenting a truly sublime musical drama.cal 'lustre'(if there be any such).

B002HWRYJE|3.0|I will review this on two levels, scientific and characterization interplay.    In terms of scientific principles this movie would have garnered no stars from me. It was simply awful. One can suspend belief or suspend an improbable situation, if the story holds together and the suspension of belief is not really important to the enjoyment of the story. In the case of Star Trek, the suspension of belief was very irritating to say the least.    First of all, the red matter in the Romulan War Ship would have weighed mega tons, as in some large number with many, many zeros. How does any ship, no matter how powerful, carry such weight? How does one work with such material, if a drop of it alone would probably weight over a ton. This irritating point detracted significantly from the movie, I believe.    Next, and this was actually worse, the drilling tool and bits needed to send this red material into the planet to cause a black hole to form to consume the planet was utter nonsensical. The platform for the drilling laser would have to be on a tether that is over 100 miles long from the ship controlling it!!! How does anything either on this earth or any earth control such a platform? Recall the BP mess in 2010. The drilling platform was a mere 1 mile above the drilling site itself, and look what happened. The platform had problems controlling the seals over the drill site, thus, the drill site leaked gas back into the drilling system, and an explosion resulted that led to many, many gallons of oil going into the gulf. The technical issues with such a long drilling system are enormous and complicated no matter what year it is. Although the issues of maintaining a seal is not present or important, what is hard to envision is that we now have 100 miles from ship to platform for the drilling system. Not 1 mile, 100 miles! Imagine the steel links to hold the platform. How much does it weigh stowed? Many tons to be sure. How does one control, even for a moment the operation ofthis complicated system, balancing the enormous weights, and all the technically difficult issues that would be part and parcel for this drilling system? How??? What utter nonsense. This part of the story was very, very irritating to me. Of all the story plots to deliver a material to destroy a planet, we now have red matter, precursor to a black hole, and a drilling platform/system that is over 100 miles long!!!! Complete and utter nonsense. The ship would have to carry the equivalent weight of a minor star to complete its tasks. Is this logical? Or is this irritating?      Characterization.  This saved the movie for me. I thought the characters blended well and the choices for Bones, Scotty, Sulu, Uhura, Chekov, even Cpt Kirk and Spock were all well done. However, I thought the characterization of Cpt Kirk was done a bit too extravantly, and how in blazes does he become Captain, yes Captain, on his very first voyage is rather stretching things too, too much. At first, Spock was rather irritating in his rather narrow view of humans. I did not like him at first, but as the story progressed I changed my mind and felt more at ease with him. Yet, I did not get the feeling from this story that I particularly liked him per se. It was the knowledge and all the prior stories of Spock and Kirk that I remembered that made the transition to this new team doable. You just knew, had to know that the relationship of the two was about to start and then go on to develop into the special one we all familiar with.    I thoroughly enjoyed Bones and Chekov and Sulu. They were interesting, funny to say the least. I also like Scotty a lot. These characters brought back memories of the ones we are all familiar with, and their humanity and interplay were believable and enjoyable to me. I like them and hope to see them together in a more plausable Star Trek story in the future. It was this feeling from seeing these new characters taking the place of the ones we are familiar with and doingit in a consistent, fresh way that made this movie a 3 star one and not zero stars.    I recommend buying this movie just for the characterization, not for the story or plot. Those issues stunk up the movie. Yes there is a lot of bang, bang shoot em up stuff for those who enjoy the action most, but this is a minor role used to entertain the need for action in all of us sitting on our couches. This is \\"eye candy\\" so to speak, forget the scientific gaps in logic for a moment. The rest of the movie is \\"candy for the heart\\". For all of us who love the characters of the original Star Trek we know so very well.             Joe Patane
B003ITZBVI|5.0|I will start by saying that I'm not a fan of comic books.  However, I do like Batman and used to enjoy watching \\"Batman The Animated Series\\" on TV.  So when I saw this Blu-Ray as a suggestion to me, I decided to pick it up.<br /><br />I'm happy I did.<br /><br />I found the movie to be entertaining and well put together.  On Blu-Ray it looks absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />I don't know if fans of the comic books would be able to pick this one apart due to small inconsistencies with the comic franchise or not, but I do know that if you are looking for a good Batman movie that isn't live action (like \\"The Dark Knight) I would highly suggest you give this one a go.
0061726826|4.0|Oliver's first book, before I fall, left me speechless--both her writing and the story. Waiting to read Delirium was hard, considering her debut novel was amazing. This dystopian novel is great, and I really can't wait for the series. The idea-- that love being a disease-- is peculiar and exceptional. I love it. Beside her beautiful writing style, I believe Oliver writes what she feels; not what she knows something feels like, and that makes me want to read her book again and again.<br /><br />When I read a book, I have a certain moderate fast pace. However, when it comes to Oliver's book, I go from moderate fast pace to slow pace. Don't get me wrong, it's not because her writing is dull or hard to read... it's only because I love her BEAUTIFUL writing, I want to soak every single word. Oliver CAN write, beautifully (attractively)! Can I just say I envy her writing? I do!<br /><br />I like this book for the most part. I am not sure if I like Lena or not. But I'm sure I don't despise her. She was a normal, plain, shy girl that I didn't connect with, but I liked to see what she does: her decision, caution, experiences, and coyness...! I guess I expected Lena to be more rebellious than she was. In contrary, Alex was a gentleman: sweet, strong, loving and a resister ... sort of resembles Hana (Lena's best friend) and he's the perfect guy for Lena. Lena's life was pretty normal before she met Alex. Her relationship with her family and her friendship with Hana was great ... until she gets infected. Then we get to see rage and anger. Which I loved!<br /><br />Oliver's writing was amazing as usual, and it wasn't hard to get through the book...although the story kind of dragged a little bit. I thought it had a lot of information that I could take in at once. This book was written beautifully but it was way too descriptive, it made me lightheaded. (I felt like half of the book was filled with so many extraneous minor details.) Yet, this book doesn't really explore the whole idea in depth. It seems like the story is pretty much about the rules and regulations of the country rather than two people's desire to be together and their rebellious act.<br /><br />Overall, I think, Oliver's writing is elegant. But the story kind of hauled for me. Regardless, I cannot wait for the next series.ike the story is pretty much about the rules and regulations of the country rather than two people's desire to be together and their rebellious act.

0307389839|4.0|An inspirational, yet short read! I received this book as a gift as I have always been interested in Murakami's work. This is a very different piece of literature than what he usually publishes, but was a good read nonetheless. I enjoyed seeing how running effected his writing life and vice versa. I also enjoyed his take on building his life and schedule around his passion. Early to bed, early to rise and put the miles behind! A look at the sport with one of literature's current master authors!
B000UR9T8C|5.0|Very good movie. It has  a great story to it. Highly recommended for spiderman lovers. Cool fight between Peter and Harry. Even though Peter and Mary Jane got back together, I wish it would have had a better ending. But overall, it's a very awesome movie!
B003PAXONC|5.0|I know a lot of people knock this movie for not being very true to the source material.  I also know a lot of people were't crazy about the ending.<br /><br />I, however, have never read the source material so I went into it not being able to compare, and I came out of the movie impressed.  I enjoyed the feeling of being alone that is portrayed in the movie.  I cried at the part with the dog.  Ultimately, I really liked the movie.<br /><br />This Collector's Edition is a nice one.  It's got the movie and some really cool swag if you're into that kind of thing.<br /><br />I waited to buy it until the price dropped to a point that I thought was great.  Right now you can get this Collector's Edition from Amazon for about the price of a normal Blu-Ray DVD in a store.<br /><br />If you're looking for this movie, this is the version to go with.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I bought three of these for my kids for Christmas. I read a lot of reviews before buying and found that people are injecting personal opinion instead of fact. Such as yes they are light (cheap) plastic, but that is a good thing if you are gamming all day on a Saturday. My kids absolutely love them; they are light weight by design (not cheap) so they can wear them for long periods of time. The sound is amazing, combined with a HDTV my oldest says even if they are cloaked he can see/hear them and sneak up on them. His friends hate playing with him now. One thing that I see in other reviews that is incorrect is that you can't hook two or more of these headphones to the same game console. Each transmitter unit has an in and out optical connection. All you have to do is connect the optical input of one to the output of another. We have successfully \\"daisy chained\\" all three head sets to one XBOX 360.     My kids have 2 Xbox 360's, 1 PS3 (old 80gig), 1 computer, 6 wireless controllers, 3 Ear Force X41 headsets, 3 HDTV's, 1 Wireless N+ Belkin router and a claw machine in one game room that is 12 X 15 with none of the interference that I've have heard others have.     They do use batteries, get rechargeable. The only thing I don't like is that when the batteries (rechargeable or not) start to run out, they do tend to pop loudly and crap out. They should either fade off, or just turn off.
B0041KKYD8|4.0|I know there are lots of fans of the original [[ASIN:B004BLTNL6 I Spit on Your Grave [Blu-ray]]] and if they think that it is better than this remake, I am sure it has to do with an emmotional attachment to the original. The original movie was made in the era of explotation movies. The original falls under the catagory of Sexplotation, because of the concentration on the explicit rape scene as opposed to the revenge. The remake shifts gears and does it intelligently. It shows enough of the abuse leading to the rape and the rape itself to make you cringe, but nothing to make it remotely sexually arrousing. It then concentrates on the revenge aspect.<br /><br />Jennifer makes her get away and survives for a month in the woods. A month is more than enough time to put together a plan and execute it. Her revenge kills each have to do with how she was treated by the man it is inflicted upon. As the best review of this film I have read so far (M. Mcallan) states, you learn enough about every character to care about them, whether you empathize for them or hate them. At times I rooted for Jennifer and at others times I cringed as she inflicted repayment to the men involved. The men were brutal with her and expected to kill her when they were done, so she just repays an eye for an eye.<br /><br />I watched this movie with my wife and she did not find it over done on the rape or the revenge, which is saying something because she can't take violence at all. If you go into the movie thinking it is just a rape movie glorifying rape then you are not going to like it and you shouldn't bother watching it. If you go into it thinking it is a revenge movie with a brutal subject, I think you will find it is a well made independent movie. I think the movie was made in a very believable way and enjoyed it. I gave 4 stars because it is pretty predictable, but that doesn't make a bad film.

038533348X|5.0|This is one of those nutty books that at times you think is barely held together, but by the end you appreciate the brilliance.  As far as I am concerned, this is Kurt Vonnegut's best book - way better than Slaughterhouse Five which seems to garner most of the attention.  Very loosely put, this is the story of a man, a powerful doomsday invention, and the circle of people whose lives and fate are interconnected because of this invention. There is alot of made up terminology in the book - alot of fictitious mumbo jumbo - yet i find years later, i still find words like granfalloon and karass very relevant to my daily living.  Trust me, there are alot of granfalloons out there!!  Vonnegut very nicely satirizes society, especially in cold war era - but still relevant today - through a fictional almost farcical setting - that is brilliantly woven together through the seeming incoherence of it all!  Loved it!

B002BSHXJA|5.0|This is the Beatles as you want them. Most of this set is made up of original recordings as the Fab 4 themselves guided the mastering. It also includes many of the early stereo recordings and stereo re-mastered songs to give you a listening comparison. Truly an excellent and inexpensive set.     After I boiled it down to my small list of favorites there were still over 70 songs! There is no other way that I can think of to get this listening value.

B003UESJH4|5.0|The King's Speech was probably one of the best films I've seen in a long time.  While I can't say that the central character was a \\"true\\" likeness of the future king of England during World War II, I think as a dramatic creation he certainly \\"rings true.\\"  Colin Firth did a fantastic job of portraying him.  The sense of frustration, anxiety, sadness, and isolation he created for his character was amazing.<br /><br />Most surprising I think, though it probably shouldn't have been, is the degree to which the prince was subject to what would be considered patent child abuse today.  It probably shouldn't have been, since the power that came to individuals favored by the king since childhood was often formidable, and the Prince of Wales was to have become king, not his younger brother.  The wonder isn't that he stuttered but that he wasn't considerably more impaired than he was by his experiences.  The fact that he could overcome his more overt signs of that oppressive upbringing with the help of the individual he consulted reveals his considerable determination as a person and the great emotional support he received as an adult from others in doing so.  His personal conflict over becoming the king was very poignant.  One is generally led to believe that individuals would--and did--kill to become king; watching someone try everything he could not to be was enlightening.  It also puts into perspective the desperate circumstances of former usurpers; the threats to them and to the country had to have been major, not only for one to undertake treason but for one to undertake the headaches of rule.<br /><br />The character of Wallis Simpson, while she did not appear often in the movie, was one that was pivotal to history.  She was well portrayed in the film; part real person, part public perception.  While I have not read her own history, I have read books in which she featured, and it would appear that she was part of the 19th century phenomenon usually practiced by wealthy 500 families in America, that of marrying a daughter to a financially strapped noble family, sort of  \\"aristocrat\\" by proxy.  I strongly suspect that Mrs. Simpson, who was definitely not of the 500, expected to \\"make the big time\\" in terms of American social climbing by becoming a reigning queen; in that she definitely misread the British people of the time--and when it came to the monarchy, everyone below the king was \\"the British people!\\"  Morganatic marriages are not something that is well accepted even today, as questions of Kate Middleton's \\"commoner\\" status suggest.  The divorced status of Camilla Bowles brought her future as \\"queen\\" into question for a long time.<br /><br />One of the things I found most intriguing was the king's status under parliamentary government.  It would appear that whereas the kings of earlier times were themselves often guilty of abusing the \\"people,\\" their function in more recent times has been as a focus of power that moderates the abuses of the people's own elected government.  Elected parliament members might have short term personal agendas, but the hereditary monarch can and does take the long term point of view; England is more-or-less his \\"estate,\\" and he doesn't want to go \\"out of business!\\"  I'm not sure if this impression is true or not, but it certainly seemed to be in the film.America, that of marrying a daughter to a financially strapped noble family, sort of  \\"aristocrat\\" by proxy.

B0034G4OZE|4.0|It's Kind of a Funny Story is a comedy-drama based on a novel by Ned Vizzini that seems to be cut from the same cloth tonally as [[ASIN:B001UV4XUG (500) Days of Summer]]. It's written and directed by frequent collaborators Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck who were responsible for the impressive Ryan Gosling film [[ASIN:B000KX0IOK Half Nelson]] a few years back and with that talent behind the camera and the talented cast in front of it this had the potential to be a great film. While some aspects are well-realized and some talented actors are given the chance to showcase a side of their talent I didn't know existed, It's Kind of a Funny Story is only kind of a good movie.    16-year-old Craig (Keir Gilchrist) comes from a steady family and goes to a prestigious school in New York, but the mounting pressures that come with being a teenager have made him depressed and lead to him contemplating suicide. Seeking help at a local hospital, he is admitted to the inpatient psychiatric floor for a minimum stay of five days. With a lack of teenage patients, Craig is placed in the adult ward and naturally feels uncomfortable surrounded by some very troubled adult patients. He does however befriend Bobby (Zach Galifianakis), an adult patient who must leave the hospital within days for a halfway house. As the two begin slowly bonding, Craig meets Noelle (Emma Roberts), an eccentric and pretty teen patient. The film co-stars Zoë Kravitz and Viola Davis with Lauren Graham and comedian Jim Gaffigan as Craig's parents.     As one can expect from a movie set at a psychiatric hospital, the film has plenty of off-beat characters but does its best to avoid the clichés that go along with this setting and keeps the focus on Craig and his relationships with those around him. While the main characters take center stage, the secondary characters remain in the background. The film does an exceptional job with the way it handles its teenage characters. It doesn't aspire to be a realistic portrait ofteens, but the teenage characters are handled accurately and the script avoids making them overdramatic or overly stereotypical caricatures of real teenagers. They have teenage emotions, but they handle these emotions with much more maturity than we're used to seeing onscreen (The Twilight Saga being an example). The relationship between Craig and Noelle is particularly sweet, with seemingly genuine chemistry between Gilchrist and Roberts. It avoids sappy sentimentality and has a sweet awkwardness that really feels natural.     Gilchrist does a fine job as Craig, never overdoing his portrayal as a confused, average teenager. There are some noticeable flaws in his acting, but none of these flaws take away from his performance and he does have the time and potential to grow. If this was a dark, emotional drama he'd be ill-fitted for the role, but the whimsical nature of the film allows him more freedom to be imperfect. His chemistry with Roberts feels very natural and Roberts does a great job with her character, even though Noelle doesn't seem fleshed-out enough. Roberts may appear a little too attractive for the role, but she's a good fit. Comedian Jim Gaffigan strays far from his stand-up persona and plays Craig's father with only a small dose of humor. If you've seen his stand-up, it may surprise you that Gaffigan can seem like a normal, serious man. When it comes to a comedian with an established persona attempting to distance himself from that, no one is more effective than Zach Galifianakis.    As a comedian's popularity rises, they open themselves to more criticism and after starring roles in The Hangover and [[ASIN:B004I9SJH0 Due Date]], Galifianakis had been written off by some as a one-dimensional comic actor. He was wise to take on the role of Bobby as he does a complete 180 from the screen persona he's established in those two movies and actually does a fine job. His performance as Bobby is a real surprise as he demonstrates a rather dynamic comedic rangewhile displaying a surprising amount of emotional depth as well. He's convincing, likable, and totally disconnected from the persona that's made him famous.    Despite being lumped into the \\"dramedy\\" category, It's Kind of a Funny Story leans much closer to drama but with a comedic tone that keeps it from taking itself too seriously. It's a likable film with likable characters but it frequently feels underwritten, ironic being based on a book. The script avoids clichéd dramatic moments and forced humor, but many story threads and character arcs don't feel fully developed. Look at the climactic scene involving Craig's Egyptian roommate for an example of this. It should be a \\"big moment,\\" but it just kind of...happens. It's Kind of a Funny Story is an entertaining, amusing film that doesn't do anything remarkable but doesn't really do anything wrong either. If you're looking for a whimsical \\"dramedy\\" that will put a smile on your face for a little under 100 minutes, it may be worth seeking out.    GRADE: B-

B004AKCME8|2.0|I read the books when I was younger, though I haven't kept up on the more recent releases, so I was excited when I found they were actually making a movie from the first three books in the series.  The trailers looked promising, though some things were clearly added or removed. The reviews were mainly favorable, so I bought the DVD, hoping for something that at least resembled the characters and events I'd read as a child.    No such luck.  The story was warped horribly - even though I can't remember details clearly from the books, I'm pretty sure St. Aggie's was not founded by Metal Beak.  Kludd certainly didn't fall out if the nest, nor would Soren have been showing off like that.  The flecks were shown as some sort of electrical magic...something, and even the main characters were turned into horrible caricatures that are almost nothing like their originals; Twilight, Digger, Otulissa...even Skench and Spoorn.    But alas, even if you ignore the books and let it stand on its own, it still wasn't worth it.  They kept just enough elements of the book to ruin the story it might have been had it been made independently.  Its character development was poor, the story was weak and predictable even if you don't know the books.  The movie feels rushed, yet never seems to go anywhere.    I wanted so badly for this movie to be enjoyable, but in the end, the only thing I can say for it is that it was beautiful.  Its incredibly well done animation is the only thing holding it up from a one rating, though I'd never recommend it to anyone.  Don't waste your time or money.  This movie isn't worth it.

0385341679|1.0|I suffered through this series because I loved The Highlander series so much. After each new book in the Fever series came out I read it only to feel frustrated by how bad the storyline was- Mac was annoying, there were so many characters/story lines that nothing ever was resolved and each story made very little progress ( this never should've been a 5 book series).  It felt like Moning didn't have an editor on this series- Mac kept spinning her wheels and having lots of internal conversations.  At the end of Shadowfever, I felt like none of the important questions had been resolved. I also felt like all the other characters ended up being irrelevant- Mac did everything, the 5 Kelter Druids were almost unnecessary (BTW, we never learned anything about Christopher).  I wish Moning had continued the Highlander series- those stories made sense. Moning just tried to cram so much into this book that she didn't tell a good story (I couldn't believe the appearance of Thr Triton Corp at the end).

B001C0U5WU|5.0|This mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version of Deep Purple's best ever album is a real treat for fans; not only has this mlps gatefold version been designed and assembled very well but the sound quality is also a vast improvement over the old cd that I owned all those years ago so much so that it was almost like listening to a different album!  Also included are 2 foldouts that contain all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.<br /><br />What makes this album so great is not only the fact that 2 of their greatest hits are on this baby: \\"Smoke On the Water\\" and my personal favourite \\"Highway Star\\" but the rest of the tracks on the album have a nice flow and none of them remotely sound like filler.  The album is rather short though with only 7 tracks but what tracks!  Another standout track is \\"Space Truckin'\\" which together with the other 2 hits mentioned earlier also shows up on what in my opinion is their best compilation album: \\"Deepest Purple\\".<br /><br />Blackmore is at the height of his playing powers here and his flawless playing is recommended listening to all aspiring rock guitarists.  The line up of Lord, Blackmore, Glover, Paice and Gillan here is also in my opinion the best ever Deep Purple lineup.<br /><br />If you are looking for just one album of these guys, this one is it and if you are a classic rock fan then you absolutely must have this album in your sonic library and this mlps version certainly does not disappoint.<br /><br />Great mlps design, good sound quality and excellent content makes this an easy recommendation.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!

0061726826|4.0|I picked up Delirium on a whim the other day when I was at the book store. I never heard of this book or the author before but I read the flap and it reminded me a lot of Matched by Ally Condie so I decided to give it a go. So the story is set up in the future where love is considered a disease and must be cured. The main character Lena is at the point of her life when she is months away from getting cured and set up with a guy that has been chosen as her future husband. She is fine with this and wants to procedure and believes it to be right... until she meets Alex. Alex flips her world upside down and makes her feel things that she believes she should not be feeling and that maybe everything she was raised to believe could be wrong. The rest of the story is her journey of finding out what may or may not be the truth and whether or not the path she was on was the right one for her.<br /><br /> I was so absorbed in the story and the characters that I couldn't put it down, that is until I got to the ending. I don't want to spoil it for anyone else but lets just say I was shocked and heartbroken. The ending of this book almost ruined my enjoyment of the story, however, after I finished it I went online and saw that this is the first part of a trilogy with that being said I have high hopes for the next installment.  The book had a lot of unanswered questions and pretty vague on the ones that were answered. Hopefully the author will touch on those more in the future.<br /><br />The characters Lena and Alex were well thought out however, there were other secondary characters that I felt were not really needed and didn't offer anything to the story. If they were written out it would not have messed with the plot at all. I give the book 4 out of 5 stars if there weren't going to be a follow up and was just left as is it would have been a solid 3.
0385340990|5.0|Mary Ann Shaffer's THE GUERNSEY LITERARY AND POTATO PEEL PIE SOCIETY is a wonderful quirky book, that by turns is funny and tragic.<br /><br />Juliet Ashton has survived the second world war. To cheer people up, she wrote a column under a pen-name. Now she wants to do something different. One day, a letter arrives from Guernsey, from someone asking for a small favor. Kind-hearted Juliet complies, and sends a note back in response. From such small beginnings, Ms. Shaffer spins a wonderful tale of wartime hardship, post-war optimism and the shadows left behind.<br /><br />This is not to say that the book is completely faultless. Some readers will be put off by the fact that this novel is actually a collection of letters, and may wonder why the author chose to cast her story in this fashion. Telling a story like that is a wonderful way of dealing with POV problems. Every character has a chance to become the narrator of his or her own story, and it can be easier to bring out voice and personality when writing in first person, rather than limited 3rd.<br /><br />(Casting novels in letter-format also has a distinguished history. All those eighteenth century novels like PAMELA, CLARISSA, EVELINA and CECILIA were written in this way. In fact the novel got started because Samuel Richardson was publishing a book of how-to letters for the nouveau riches. Letter number 7 or 8 of this compendium was how to tell your parents that the squire is making unwanted advances. And so PAMELA was born.)<br /><br />Perhaps the other biggest problem with the novel is the revelation of the death of the main character, which occurs halfway through the book. Putting this revelation later would have enabled the author to use it to heighten tension. On the other hand, this character takes up a lot of psychic space, and so getting rid of her allows other characters to flourish.<br /><br />But such objections are minor. If you allow yourself not to be put off by all the letters, I think you will find this novel a surprising treat.
B001NLKT60|2.0|I managed to work through this disappointment, but it made me question if I'd actually liked Tattoo either.  The characters were different than in the first novel.  Weaker charicatures.  The plot is driven by implausible coincidences.  If you loved the first, leave your passion intact and skip this.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The cast is outstanding!  I hate they ended it so soon!  What were they thinking to cancel this???  All the good shows die young :(  Now back to the point at hand.  If you are into sci-fi your going to love this series.  It has a bit of everything.  Action, adventure, mystery, romance, comedy, you name it, its pack in there somewhere.
B000SVZIGC|2.0|I've just come back from a train wreck. The cause seems to have been that there were two different trains moving in diametrically opposed directions at very high speeds. The result is this terrible, animated mess of a film.<br /><br />Now, Anastasia is often remembered by most as a successful 1990's member of the in-illustrious Don Bluth canon of quasi-Disney disasters that have managed to accomplish the following: introducing horrible nightmares into the minds of countless children with their inexplicably morbid images and flashy sequences, causing mass confusion over which popular animated films are (or are not) from the Disney corporation, and (it is speculated) helping to trigger the so-called \\"Disney Renaissance\\" that gave birth to such classics as Aladdin and the Lion King (and, it should be noted, such duds as Pocahontas and The Hunchback) by providing the only viable competition in the industry.<br /><br />What is however not usually recognized about this film (or the Bluth canon) is that it is not just the product of Don Bluth but rather Don Bluth and Gary Goldman, Bluth's longtime friend and collaborator. Typically Goldman has played the role of \\"supporting man\\" to Bluth's creative engine, doing work as a co-producer or co-animator, but in a significant number of Bluth's films he also co-directed. It is noteworthy that these particular films are some of Bluth's absolute worst.<br /><br />The reason I mention this relationship is that it is apparent from watching this film that the dual-headed nature of this film's production is a good explanation for what may have gone wrong with it, since watching it is such an jarring and disjointed experience. In the end, it is an aesthetically pretty mess that was shoddily strung together and prematurely delivered to market and there is this odd unfinished feel to the movie throughout, in-spite of the detailed, awkward animation which itself appears to be more than complete.<br /><br />This is an ahistorical tale about princess Anastasia, daughter of the last Czar of Imperial Russia, Nicholas II, who was alleged to have inexplicably disappeared sometime between the time her family was massacred by the Bolsheviks, with her included it now turns out, and the time in which someone outside of this event bothered to take a head-count. One theory, now discredited, which is explored by this movie, was that the princess had escaped the fate of her family members only to finally remerge publicly many years later. Many people decry this film for abusing and even grossly distorting the historicity of these events but I am not concerned with that here. I see no reason why we couldn't just pretend that this is fantasy and enjoy the film on other merits, but in fact those other merits wound up being impossible for me to enjoy.<br /><br />What really irks me about this movie is how the narrative unfolds in such as way as to make you feel crazy. One moment Anastasia is characterized as a naive, sweet peasant girl, fulfilling stock Disney princess traits \\"borrowed\\" from Disney classics like Snow White or Cinderella. The next moment, however, she's become, without proper instigation, a sarcastic harpy clawing away at the film's male love interest and then, quite suddenly, transforming back again without explanation. As if this more subtle disjointed characterization were not sufficient, in early scenes Anastasia is shown with short brown hair under a Muscovite hat only to emerge later with long reddish hair that, again, clearly \\"borrows\\" it's look from Disney's Ariel of the Little Mermaid.<br /><br />Other characters fair no better. The annoying Disney-esque familiar to our villain, Rasputan, is an obnoxious little white bat (which channels Iago from Aladdin) who inexplicably moves from being a sinister and vindictive side-kick to an unwilling and disinterested participant to his master's evil scheme. While I am all for a villain having some kind of moral conversion in the course of a story I would at least like to have a reason given for such a change.<br />But there are no reasons given and it is as if there were two different people working on this film with two different ideas about what the finished product ought to look and feel like. Personalities change, physical appearances change, sequences seem like they were out of place or even done as possible, mutually exclusive alternatives and then just thrown into the final mix anyway and so on. There are countless continuity errors, non-sequiturs, garbled quick fixes and implausible conveniences smattered all over the face of this production and it is jarring to viewer.<br /><br />At first I sort of liked this movie. I like the subject matter, I like the look of the film, the soundtrack (which is oddly good for a Don Bluth movie) and I even like the voice acting for the most part. But in the end I found myself getting ripped away from what I was watching by the constant distraction of absurdity and inconsistency that made me recognize all the more that I was really just watching a shoddy, overly ambitious mess.<br /><br />Perhaps if there were only one captain of the ship then this movie would have been more even handed and some of the big decisions about what was to result could have been made so as to produce something more coherent and polished. As is typical with Don Bluth, there was a lot wasted potential in this film.<br /><br />It's not as bad as a Troll in Central Park (what is?) but this is no Secret of Nihm either.uch a change.

B0040JHWKS|2.0|Was looking forward to listen to some unreleased and re-released Bruce tunes. Yet I found something missing in the quality and reproduction of the music on these CD's.

B001TI3OFA|5.0|Without doubt, one of the best books ever written on successful negotiating. Fisher and Ury nailed it. Their system is appropriate in just about every arena, enabling you to take a professional approach and avoid the histrionics. A must read for anyone who wants a win/win outcome.

B0041KKYEM|5.0|With the bravado of Fellini and the artistic sensibility of Bergman, Aronofsky has directed and written a piece that will live on in film history--not only a film noir pigeonhole--but also in widely respected \\"best of...\\" lists for decades to come, including eventually American Film Institute.  Black Swan is to Natalie Portman as Sunset Boulevard is to Gloria Swanson. A defining role. Portman stole the movie with wide-eyed innocence, sinewy body bursting with athleticism, and a mysterious charm that surges forth in each provocative scene like waves on the seaside shore.  She plays the role with gusto, yet plays the naive Nina as a heroine to which we can all relate.  She literally \\"makes\\" the movie, and has the Oscar to show it (February 27, 2010).<br /><br />Although Aronofsky seems intent on telling the viewer that BLack Swan is the companion piece to The Wrestler, mentioning it at every interview, the two movies couldn't be further apart in texture, richness of story and acting.  The Wrestler was Rourke's return to the spotlight, but the subject matter was contrived, a meaningless foray into the life and times of a sometime deli meatcutter, sometimes washed up wrestler meandering through life.  Aronofsky would be best to keep Black Swan in its own pulpit as it's a force to be reckoned with... a deep mulitilayered story of a ballerina pressured by her mother, her coach, her peers and, in the end, the opera house audience, to \\"be perfect\\".  A visual and psychological extravaganza, it would have been too easy to go over the top with the transformation to swan for Nina (Portman), particularly in the physical metamorphosis.  But, alas, the balance was sublime, with equal parts horror and empathy, with a dash for raciness, to make a heady brew that will leave theater-goers dazzled and exhausted.<br /><br />A tour de force, a modern masterpiece.
B002JVWR54|5.0|Even though I was a fan from the first season, I have to admit that it was slow and it never seemed like the producers knew where they wanted to go with. The second season however had a clear direction and once Whedon knew the series would be cancelled, and he moved quickly to a conclusion, the it became really interesting. The episode in the attic is a classic and has some great visuals. This is worth watching, even if you haven't seen the first season.
B003UESJH4|4.0|Colin Firth was B+ performance as Bertie.<br /><br />Mrs. Tim Burton (I forget her real name.  Oh, it's Helena Bottoms Carterer, my wife just yelled to me) is a solid B.<br /><br />Why Firth and Burton's wife (or girlfriend or whatever) got nominated for Oscars is beyond me.  They won't win, that much is sure.<br /><br />Now, Geoffrey Rush, the honorable Lionel, has his acting chops down, and really stole this movie completely, sort of like McCauley Calkin did for Home Alone.  Lionel is passionate, irreverent, unorthodox, somewhat vain, but always has the king's \\"back\\", as homies these days say.  If he were a speech therapist now, he'd likely get his pants sued off for not having a license, but that is now and this was then.  Back in the thirties, anyone with the kahones to call the future king Bertie without soiling themselves at the thought of being beheaded gets a high five and cowabunga sign from me, your honorable reviewer.  And Geoffrey Rush, in what was likely his first movie ever--I mean, I see a ton of flicks and I don't recall him in anything else; my wife is yelling over that she thinks he was Cooter in the new Dukes of Hazzard (but I think it was Bob Denver, frankly, but I'll keep my piehole shut lest I be sleeping on the divan for a week).<br /><br />Actually, Wikipedia says that Mr. Rush won a Tony and and Emmy and an Academy award!  So, I guess he's at least been in an opera, in a circus, and one other movie.  My son just walked by and recognized Geoffrey Rush from Pirates of the Caribbean (I won't correct the seven year old, but I'd bet my left thumb that was Gerard Depardieu in Pirates.  Oh, well).<br /><br />So, all in all, if your PBS on Dish Network goes out when you're late paying your monthly bill, rent this Masterpiece Theater ditty and watch some mediocre acting except for Lionel, who is much improved from Cooter, and shows some real talent in this one.  I hear Scorcese is considering another Goodfellas update, a new installment, and I think Mr. Rush would be ideal as Maury the Wig salesman.  If you like my idea, I don't need any money or anything (just put my name in the credits). I'm kidding Marty.  I could use some dough, sure. Thanks.he Wig salesman.  If you like my idea, I don't need any money or anything (just put my name in the credits). I'm kidding Marty.  I could use some dough, sure. Thanks.
B001BNFR6W|1.0|I bought this compilation for my wife for Christmas. Unfortunately some of the reviews on this product were correct -- I should have listened.

This is unacceptable by any standard.     Do not buy this compilation.

0393330435|5.0|Steve Wozniak is my personal hero, and one of the most important people alive today, thanks to his invention of the first practical and mass-marketed personal computer. It is great to hear his story coming from himself, but honestly, this book doesn't say much of anything new that you can't find in previous books (such as [[ASIN:0813342643 Computer: A History Of The Information Machine, Second Edition (The Sloan Technology Series)]] and [[ASIN:1593270100 Apple Confidential 2.0: The Definitive History of the World's Most Colorful Company]]), with the sole exception maybe being his childhood contributions to science fairs. It's a wonderful and inspirational story, to be sure, but it's been told before. Still, I liked this book.

Sometimes there are good reasons why stuff never sees the light of day for 30 years.However, the bootleg DVD from Texas is almost worth the price of the box set. If you ever saw Bruce in those years, this is an excellent representation of the fantastic , long shows that he performed. This box set is only for really die-hard Bruce fans, others, beware.

B004EQAVHI|5.0|One should view this film based on its theme of humanity and for what it asks one to think about in terms of time, life, & death.   The films makes you ask questions. If the film does not make you ask questions(and those questions shouldn't be about the plot, characters, etc.), then you probably missed the point of the movie.  I admit the book is better than the film. However, the film still holds its own.  This film is one of the most underrated films of 2010...if not the most underrated film of 2010.
B003ZTQN1I|3.0|Although I like what IS included here, I am very dissapointed about all the good music that's in the film and NOT on this CD.
B0041ZQHHA|2.0|I am the biggest Killers fan - all albums I love and value the difference in them.  But, be aware when you buy his solo album, sweet but almost too sweet. I understand Europe, especially the UK has a different spin on him, and he is lovely, but I was a little let down, considering he did mention that some of these tracks were meant for The Killers, and I wonder what direction and sound they would have produced with them. Secondly, I needed to hear some a mix of beats and themes in his music writing, too much one way is not enough value for entire album purchase. But luckily, this album was priced lower, and I think the label understood this and his popularity in the U.S. market, that is why you see him do more shows in other parts of the world, where he clearly has The Killers market behind him, now he really needs to get the band back together in reality. Two good songs on this album: Flamingo: Crossfire and his duo \\"Hard Enough\\" which no radio station or college alternative plays. But that is the music industry - and that is individual taste. Welcome to America and our ability to like what we like. I give it two stars, fitting for the most I found in this album. I would really love to see his solo performance to get a better perspective.   Let's face it, there are so many bands out there producing and I just don't think this album was up to standards (producing) to where Brand Flowers or BR of The Killers should be. It was elementary for him and for world know record label.    Saying all that, I like the two songs and love BR/The Killers. I would to see BR solo tour and of course, I would love to see The Killers back being a band and jointly producing some great music. (ps. I spent over $15,000 in the last 4 years seeing TK and even saw them making their DVD at the Royal Albert in London, so I am fan and proud of it.)
B004G600A4|5.0|I have to admit that I've become jaded and cynical when it comes to Disney and their ridiculous amount of merchandising which includes a TV show or a movie, and not the other way around, i.e., a movie or TV show that includes some merchandise. This was my attitude towards \\"Tangled\\".    Also, the trailer looked cute, but would the movie really be more than just fluff? On the other hand, did the trailer truly reflect the feel of the movie? Take, for instance \\"UP\\" which was portrayed as a light-hearted and funny film in the trailers, and not the slightly scary and slightly dark film with mean pack dogs and a villain trying to kill a cute, small kid.    But, as the mother of a 7 year old girl who was dying to see it, I gave in, and we saw it. And, I'm happy to say. I loved it, and so did my 7 year old and my 12 year old girl. It was charming and funny and had just the right variety of characters - light and dark - to make it interesting without being too scary, as well as, just the right amount of action versus mushy scenes to make it enjoyable, not too fast moving to be impossible to keep up with, and not so slow to wonder when it would end. We loved the songs, the silliness, Rapunzel, Flynn, the king's horse out to get them both, Rapunzel's strength and building realization of who she was. Also, there were no adult-humor hidden inuendos (like in Shrek and other not-G-rated movies that really are not for kids).    We loved it. It would be hard to beat the magic of The Little Mermaid, which was hard to beat till Beauty and the Beast came along. I'm not sure Tangled beats either of those movies, but it comes close!    \\"Skillets! Who knew, right?!\\"
B0042KZJ46|5.0|Over time on these pages, I've marveled at the degree to which fans of artists battle tooth-and-nail to prove fairly meaningless points about artists and albums they revere of hate.    Life is short, and this is a moving and permanent album, warts and all. Soundboard recordings never deliver the sound stage of a well-miked stage recording. That's OK.  We'll live.    This final,recorded concert by Bob Marley summarizes, in its playlist, in the struggles of the performer to remain his vocal best, and in the meaning of his lyrics -- succeeds brilliantly. The back-up is superb, and despite the source audio, delivers a round, full recording.    I can recall arriving at concert locations towards the end of Marley's life, once at Tanglewood, and once at another venue, when concerts were canceled and listeners knew something was wrong.  I can recall visiting Kingston when I was in my late '20's, experiencing -- in a visitor's way -- the turmoil and anger in Marley's country.    If this recording -- which incorporates many of his memorable songs -- succeeds, it's because it's a great farewell, not only to the artist who introduced reggae to these shores (there will be detractors of this statement) but also helped the young experience inner freedom during a time of uncertainty.    Well produced, packaged and manufactured, I have no gripes. This is the guy we remember.  He was not a god, and his songs weren't anthems; but he was a great artist, and here he says goodbye.  Those who remember him, for the most part, will love it, and those who are less acquainted will discover something beautiful, rhythmic and liberating here.    And at this price?  Really.    Five happy stars.
B000E6ET1G|5.0|It seems others here were searching for a certain song when they first found this. In the late seventies I had a hankering to hear the 13th Floor Elevators' \\"You're Gonna Miss Me\\" (from 1966)again. The record store clerk found this album and ordered it for me. It also contains what was my favorite radio song in 1966, 'Sugar and Spice' by the Cryan Shames. Well, I'm old. I must admit I remember almost all these songs from their original era like it was yesterday. And it still remains my favorite time period for music, even though I am also a fan of Fleet Foxes and Iron and Wine, so I'm not stuck in one groove. But, for its size and price, I couldn't think of a better album to get to know the mid-sixties scene and all that it influenced later, especially if you put these smaller acts beside the Beatles, Stones, etc. It will round out your idea of the time, not to mention being great fun.<br /><br />One thing interested me about the album, and now again as I listen to the CD version. Electra Records in '66 and '67 was just breaking into the rock field from being exclusively a folk label. So why did they not use any of their own tracks for this album? They had 'My Little Red Book' and 'Seven and Seven Is' by Love, all the hits by the Doors, 'Mary Mary' by Paul Butterfield, and a lot of others that fit this type of music perfectly. Why, when putting out this album, did they not use any of their own original tracks but got all of these from other labels? Just asking.
B004HWR406|4.0|After reading all the mixed reviews, I found not much to critisize about this movie at all.  The word isnt enjoyable, but I find it really cool that the creator of facebook even aloud it. It was mostly about the college aspect of it, friends, trials and tribulations of all of the above while creating a billion dollar \\"idea\\" and having to deal with alot of the consequese, and those that want a piece of you / it.  I thought it was done very well even though I think I read somewhere that the CEO indicated that it is not entirely accurate he felt that it was a fair representation.<br />L 2/10/11
0553381687|5.0|This is a great book but I have to urge you TO NOT READ THIS BOOK! The story has no ending, the author has put no effort into finishing the series. If you read this book you will read the next 3 and be left hopelessly stranded waiting for the ending that never comes. I wish I would have never picked this book up 14 years ago...
B004AHNIGM|5.0|This is an amazing album, its brilliant, its beautiful, its moving, I cant say enough good things about it, highly recommended to any and all music lovers, especially of the blues.  Thank you Gregg Allman!
B000WCDI5K|5.0|I had heard The Killers several times on radio, and actually thought pretty good about them, without noticing any specific song-titles. My first impression was that they must be British, reminding me a lot about groups like Blur and Starsailor. It was only when I heard The Killers' version of \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" that I became seriously interested. A fantastic version that deservedly brought new focus to one of Dire Staits' best songs.<br /><br />When I searched on the net I also discovered that the group had recorded a new interpretation of the classic \\"Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town\\", which for me clearly surpassed previous versions. I had to find out where these numbers could be found on CD . It proved to my luck to both songs are found on \\"Sawdust, \\" which is a collection of outtakes and assorted oddities that have not found their way into the official albums. The music is recorded in the period 2003-2007.<br /><br />Fortunately, and of course, there are also many great songs among The Killers' original material. Being brought forward deserves alternate version of \\"Sam's Town\\", a great song. The opening track \\"Tranquilizers\\", which features guest appearance by Lou Reed is another of the pleasant surprises - having both Bowie and Sparks elements. The same can probably said about \\"Where the White Boys Dance\\", an outtake from \\"Sam's Town\\".<br /><br />Brit- and Indie-Pop is focused on \\"Glamerous Indie Rock and Roll\\" - could well have been a Blur song.<br /><br />Magnificent but more traditional is \\"Daddy's Eyes\\". Solid straightforward rock can be found on \\"Change Your Mind \\".<br /><br />A beautiful and a worthy final to the set is \\"Mr Brightside\\", which in glimpses contains techno elements.<br /><br />Finally \\"Show You How\\" which, with its catchy guitar theme is a song must return to. A very fine CD which actually works fine as a whole - a real album.
0399156577|3.0|I only read Nora Roberts novels and this one was pretty good but it was a little more violent than what I enjoy reading.  I didn't like the ending either.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|If you've read all the other Fever books, you will devour this book.  I loved it - I thought all the answers were wrapped up nicely.  I know we don't find out exactly what Barron's is, but I like Mac's attitude that it doesn't really matter.  He has her heart and that's what's important.  I wish the story didn't end - would love to see more books in the future with off-shoots from this one.  Well done!
B0042MEQVG|5.0|my daughter wanted this for her b-day so i'm glad i could get it for her at such a reasonable price. thanks amazon.com!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1439153663|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I've read many books dealing with this time and place. Many good, many unrealistic in their portrait of slavery and life on a plantation. That's why I liked this one so much.  It was so realistic in it's depiction of what life truly was like in that time and place. I'm really surprised at the people who found the realism of this book to be off putting. I found it to be an engrossing page turner!
B004HYDL1K|4.0|Unlike some who apparently watched this for the plot, which was the most serious part of the movie, I watched this for pure entertainment. That it was, with its over the top violence. This was not a movie to be taken seriously, though the politics involved apparently didn't sit well with some. Personally, I think of politics to be as much of a joke as the rest of the movie. I don't understand those wanting a better plot for a movie that was hard to take serious in the first place, but oh well.
0470913029|5.0|This book is a great source of information. Helps to eliminate the misinformation out there about what is and isn't healthy. No need to count calories, drink 20 cups of water a day, buy food you can't get at a grocery store (or farmers market if you live in cali, even better!), and lastly no reason to be hungry. Eat the right food and it takes care of itself. I lost 15 lbs and I wasn't overweight to begin with. I have gone from decent shape to good shape and I haven't even increased the amount of working out.
B002ZG97RE|1.0|Reminded me of the Bourne movies, which I don't like.  Gritty and realistic, but the fun or thrills, like the WMD, are nowhere to be found.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|Overall a good movie. Not quite as good as the first Iron Man, but still enjoyable. As for the package itself, I think it is excellent. This is the first Blu-Ray movie that I have bought, so I don't really know what to expect. I like the fact that it comes with a DVD and a digital copy. I wish more movies were like this one. The redeeming process for the digital copy was very simple and quick.
B002RSDW80|2.0|Started well, Streep as Child is fabulous, but the plot stalls over the last half as the movie loses its verve.
B004DK5CW4|4.0|Secretariat was a very good movie, but there just wasn't  enough about the horse.  I thought Seabiscuit was a better movie, as it was more about the horse (regardless of a couple of minor mistakes) and how all the \\"players\\" came together at a time in our history when the people needed inspiration.    I remember when Secreatariat was racing and it was exciting to see a Triple Crown winner after 25 years!  I thought the acting by Diane Lane was superb!  She should have been nominated for an Academy Award!!     The bottom line is that I thought it was a good movie and I will buy the DVD... but Seabiscuit is still tops!
B0032JTV6U|5.0|I was very happy with the DVD set I recieved. It was in perfect condition, and I got it nearly a week before I was expecting it to come, which I was very happy about. Plus, Glee is just awesome :)
B003L5H25W|4.0|When I saw the deluxe edition re-release of Exile on Main Street, I thought it would be interesting to have the bonus tracks. One or two are interesting and raw, helping to shed light on the creative process that went into one of the best rock albums of all time. But most of the bonus tracks are throw-aways.     Which is a shame, because Exile shows the Stones at their peak, combining influences and reaching out far beyond their Chuck Berry blues roots. The Stones had been growing as musicians throughout the late 60s, but the psychedelic diversion of \\"Satanic Majesties\\" didn't quite work; the Stones weren't ones for dashikis and flowers. They pulled back into rocking blues with Beggars' Banquet, Let it Bleed, and Sticky Fingers, all fantastic albums. But Exile is like their OK Computer or Kid A, their Rubber Soul or Revolver, their Automatic for the People or Monster (depending on which of those albums you thought were inflection points for the bands). Exile was not a diversion, it was an explosion of all of the influences around the Stones. It's a magnificent album with a variety of styles that somehow cohere as a single work.     However, the bonus tracks are not so great, and mostly for completists. I don't think there's one that I regularly listen to. Most feel like outtakes, and the tracks that made it onto the album are nice to hear before full production. But they're just okay.     But if you only know the Stones through their hits (and there are some on this album), do yourself a favor and check out \\"Shine a Light,\\" \\"Soul Survivor,\\" or \\"Ventilator Blues.\\" There is not a song on this album that feels dated in any way.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|Veryy  pleased  with  my  purchases  gilmore girls,,&  Kindel,, prices &  delevery  perfect,, never  hesitate  to  buy  from Amazon
1416589473|5.0|I want to get straight to the point, and start with the most negative thing: Too bad people who read this without having played Guild Wars are missing great background information.  But then again, you can do without it.  It is still fun and great to read.  And if you also read Edge of Destiny, you won't even notice it any more.  It's recommended to read this one first
B002HFJ77S|1.0|This had such promise...on which it completely failed to deliver.<br />I love Sophie Kinsella's books in general. Fell in love with the Shopaholic, loved REMEMBER ME and THE UNDOMESTIC GODDESS...and figured this would be just as good.<br />Boy, was I wrong.<br />Lara is a doormat who allows everyone in the world to walk all over her, never offers a reasonable explanation for much of what she does, and totally ditzes out her professional life.<br />Sadie is unbearable. Just unbearable. This is not a relative I'd have been proud to know. The more accurate rendition of what this woman deserves, by her conduct in this book at least, is the silent, indifferent funeral she gets at the beginning. If Lara had had any sense at all, she would have refused to do this woman's bidding and told her off. There's nothing charming AT ALL about their relationship; it's manipulative, dishonest, and grating. Even the few moments that have whimsy about them are played so clumsily and strung out so long that they lose their sparkle about halfway through.<br />...and the people who brought up the length of this book are right, as well. If anything, this is a short story or a novella that Kinsella decided to turn into a full-length novel. The result suffers on so many levels that it's simply not worth sticking with.<br />Read this one from the library, folks.
B003XQRZ7E|5.0|A real piece of work by real players! If you want to hear real music that isn't pro tool'd and pitch corrected to death like all the other so called music being release by major labels these days buy this CD. Powered by four unheard of (thus the words super group) talented players, recorded in only two weeks this Record is epic and I suspect will be remembered as such. I am happily waiting for the next CD they do and would love to hear Glen and Joe expand the vocals to some tasty harmonies.
B002ZG999U|4.0|Mindless over-the-top action featuring some of the biggest names in action movies. Pure fun if you're looking for an action movie. If you're looking for more, go elsewhere.
B003Q6D282|3.0|I thought this final Saw was somewhat of a let down.  It just didn't seem to be as graphic as the previous ones were.  Would l buy this last Saw again -- I am not sure.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Well written, well directed, well acted, gorgeous cinematography. Starts out a bit scattered, but if you tough it out through the first half hour, everything becomes pretty clear quickly.    Some of the negative reviews raise a few nits(of the sort like: Why didn't character X simply do A instead of B? or Isn't it a contradiction when event Y happens, given what we were told earlier?). I won't go into any detail on them here except to acknowledge that a few of them are fair points, but in spite of all that, the story still holds together extremely well.
1878424319|5.0|I'm reading Chapter 3 of this book, not making assumptions.  This book is wonderful, and I love it!  I will keep it with me forever!  It really gives me in-depth knowledge and meaning of why we think, as humans, they way we do.  My friend recommended this book to me, and I'm so glad she did!
B003QCCS36|5.0|Ray's music is a bit of country, blues, and folk.  Every song tells a story.  Its a great album.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Just allow me to say, I'm not a gaming or electronics expert.     This headset was relatively easy to get working, just follow the step-by-step directions and you'll be listening to virtual violence in no time. If I had one complaint, it would be the cord seems a bit hefty between the gaming console and the volume control box. But it's not a complaint, just an observation.     The sound is nice. Lots of lows/highs and the bass is sufficient. I mainly purchased this so the other people in my home are not bothered by my gaming habits and for that it has served its purpose. I haven't actually used the mic, so it wouldn't be fair to rate it.     In conclusion, if you need a gaming headset, this is one you could buy. Thank you.
1439153663|4.0|I loved the development of all the characters in this book, and actually had to refer to previous pages in order to keep all the characters straight.  Though there were numerous characters who were developed with detail, the book is written through the eyes of just two of the characters.  The author was able to create a very dramatic story throughout most of the book keeping my interest from chapter to chapter.  At the later part it seemed that the drama was a bit repetitive and I was inclined to scan a number of pages because nothing new was happening.  I loved the comparison of values and kinship between the white plantation owners vs. the black servants.  I would recommend this book.
B001E3AXGS|5.0|One would think as we celebrate, and rightly so, Abraham Lincoln's birthday that everything that needs to be said about the man has been written, and written in profusion and to exhaustion. I believe that fact is essentially true, although that has not stopped all and sundry from taking a shot at reformulating, or \\"uncovering\\" the \\"real\\" Lincoln as the fairly recent attempts to win Lincoln for the \\"Homintern\\" (the English poet W.H. Auden's term, not mine) on the question of his sexual preferences indicates. That said, after reading Doris Kearns Goodwin's Team Of Rivals it is apparent that there are reformulations and there are reformulations. Here Ms. Goodwin has gathered much material that I have seen in other sources and tells a very interesting and detailed politically-etched story about the way that Abraham Lincoln was able to use his sharply-honed skills to weld together a presidential cabinet that, with few defections and fewer resignations, ran the Unionist side in the American Civil War. For those already familiar with battles, military victories and personalities, and grand strategies this is a very good inside look at the mechanics of how the Union victory was won. If that fight was a close thing at times it was not Lincoln's lack of ability to stay the course and to push the fight forward that was to blame.     As I mentioned above most of the material used here, including many of the humorous (1860s humorous) anecdotes and parables that Lincoln was famous for, have seen the light of day in other sources, especially in poet and fellow Illinoisan Carl Sandburg's old time multi-volume study. Where Ms. Goodwin shines is on the information about the fight for the formation of the Republican Party in the 1850s and in chronicling Lincoln's almost compulsive desire from early on to mark his name in the stars. The struggle to create that new party, and the sketches of the men that were drawn to it, including Lincoln, out of the divergent political tendencies thatwere coming apart in the tradition Whig and Northern Democratic parties as a result of the pressures of the slavery question represented some of the most interesting parts of the book. The mix and matches of personalities and divergent political backgrounds that came together and formed its core, men like William Seward, Montgomery Blair, and Simon Chase joined by Unionist Democrats and Whigs like Edwin Stanton and Edward Bates, were those that Lincoln had to work with in order to form a coalition, a popular front if you like, that held together under his authority to get the necessary job done.     There has been some recent controversy over the question of Lincoln's racial views and whether he was, personally, a racist or not. While that question is more germane than the once concerning his sexual preferences I believe that Ms. Goodwin has put paid to that question by her narrative. Clearly Lincoln, as he entered the presidency, had the typical racial views of his times, his white man's times, no question. In that sense Seward, and more so, Chase held more \\"advanced\\" views and were more comfortable with working with blacks. The beauty of Lincoln, as a kicking and screaming late covert to \\"high\\" abolitionist positions is that he was able to transcend his own personal views.     In that sense Ms. Goodwin, however, may have underestimated the influence that the \\"team\\" had on Lincoln's racial views, as they meshed together to turn what started as a straight up, although still historically important, struggle for the Union to the more important struggle to break slavery as a reputable modern form of servitude. The ups and downs of that struggle to focus the fight on abolition form the core of this book. If you are not familiar, beyond the general high school or college history books, on the subject of the American Civil War and you are not desperate to know, in detail, every battle, skirmish, and mere looking mean at each other across every picket line, or every military commander, drunk or sober, or much about what was happening politically on the Confederate side once the war started this book is for you. And if you want to have a well written political narrative of the hows and whys of Lincoln's growing political authority during the Civil War and understand why War Minister Stanton's statement after his assassination \\"now he belongs to the ages\\" rings true you had better read this one.
0321647440|5.0|I haven't completed reading this book but I would like to comment on other reviewers issues in the 1st chapter.    For the book itself, it is typical Apple training. One seems to forget that Apple programs are usually more friendly to the user than Windows programs are. So this book walks you thru navigating the screens, shows you easy shortcuts along the way and makes sure you understand how to complete every task that Aperture 3 has to offer. I would have never found the \\"easy\\" way to do things without reading this book. (Sometimes Apple makes things so easy that you don't expect it.) I have used other books for Apple Pro Training and each has helped me to be very knowledgable of the program it was written for.    OK....The reviews say there are items missing on the CD. The only problem is with \\"Lesson 1\\" photos but they are all actually on the CD. The problem is that you have to find them. The procedure to find them can be found on the Peachpit Press website.  [...]    Look under products tab, find this book by it's \\"ISBN\\" number and click on the \\"Updates\\" tab. The instructions will walk you thru the procedure. No additional downloads required!        Good luck, hope this helps.
B004G600A4|5.0|This movie is amazing. It brings back all the good that I was starting to think that Disney left behind. Sure, in the past 5 years Disney has had some \\"cute\\" movies but this one brings Disney back to the era of The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin. First of all, Alan Menkin, the man who wrote all of the aforementioned movies songs, wrote ALL the songs for Tangled. Also the storyline is great, I really didn't plan on seeing this movie(I'm 19 years old)and all my friends said \\"No, you have too! It's sooooo good!\\" and they were right.
B003Q6D25K|5.0|If you liked the first one, then you'll LOVE this movie!<br /><br />It really shows where the haunting started and why the demon is haunting this family and what it truly wants from them.  Also it has some funny moments as well.  A must buy for fans of the \\"found footage\\" genre!
0545265355|5.0|This trilogy is a must read!!  I could not put the book down.  Do yourself a favor and buy the trilogy set because waiting on the next book to arrive was torture!  Strongly recommend this to anyone 15+.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|Awesome sounds with Audiotechnica ATH-A700. Without E5 the headphones are very soft and quiet with an iPhone. I bought the E5 cuz I knew the headphones sounded really good on a standard PC output. The E5 really does make a difference. The only thing I don't like about it is the boost switch. It's a little hard to use specially since its so small. It wouldn't deter me from buying it again though esp for the price. I really like that its USB rechargeable.
B003EYVXTG|4.0|After the disappearance of her father who has been dealing with illegal drug activities, 17-year-old Ree Dolly who lives in the Ozark Mountains has to take on the role as head of the family and look after her sick mother and two younger siblings. Her neighbors and relatives offer her some help, but when Ree starts questioning the members of the small community about her father's whereabouts she is faced with a wall of lies and secrecy.<br /><br />Independent filmmaker Debra Granik's second feature film, after her directorial debut \\"Down to the Bone\\" (2004), is an adaptation of a Daniel Woodrell novel with the same name from 2006, and gives a realistic depiction of an American highland community where the residents are scared to silence by an extensive underworld of illegal met-amphetamine labs. With a camera that tracks every move the main character makes and a persuasive linear narrative, Debra Granik has created a thrilling and unpredictable social crime drama with a lurking atmosphere and a credible story co-written by Anne Rosellini. The overall acting is good and Golden Globe nominee Jennifer Lawrence who previously appeared in Guillermo Arriaga's \\"The Burning Plain\\" (2008) is exceptional in her second lead role as a young woman struggling to save her family from being victimized by her father's criminal actions. This is a fine piece of American film where the main focus rests on the characters, the milieu and the story.

142313494X|1.0|I have tried and tried to get into this and have managed to get to page 86. The dialogue is horrible. The author never spent any time developing his characters or setting so I feel that during his dialogue it is like one person talking to himself the entire time. In addition I fee the pacing is bad. I watched the movie first and thought it was entirely too choppy so I thought I would read the book and now I know why the movie was choppy...because the book was too. I don't see what all the hype is about. First person books are hard enough to read and when they're bad, they're really bad and when they're good they're really good. This book was simply unfinishable.
B0002M5UA6|5.0|The Christmas Show December 18,1960 Jack looks for Christmas gifts in a department store and encounters Frank Nelson as the floor manager,Mel Blanc and Barbara Pepper as salespeople and Benny Rubin as a bandit. This classic is noted as one of the show's most hilarious episodes.  The New Year's Eve Show  December 30,1956  During Jack's momologue about his Christmas gifts, Don comes out to announce a purse has been found. It turns out to belong to Jayne Mansfield, who was sitting in the audience when the usher grabbed her purse- she considers this to be a pretty sneaky way to get a guest star. The Sportsmen Quartet and Rochester perform New Year's in Trinidad for the Lucky Strike ad. In the sketch,Jack hosts a talent contest where Mel Blanc plays an animal impersonator.
B000VUCIZO|4.0|I started to read this book after iCon by Jeffrey S. Young and William L. Simon. I think it's more fun to read a same story in both ways. I'm interested in Apple's history especially the early days. iWoz is the book to help me. Compared with iCon, iWoz is a much easier book, which means no difficult words inside. Thanks to Woz's casual way of writing.<br /><br />You will find tremendous little stories on the tech icon in this book. I can't say Woz was smarter than anyone of us. But he was lucky enough to witness the start of era of computers. Any one had the vision could be a big success now. Don't be sad. We still have the same chance. One example is Mark Zuckerburg and Facebook.<br /><br />What about the next Facebook and Apple? That depends on your own vision.
1439177783|5.0|Prior to reading this book, I didn't know who Portia De Rossi was.  My boyfriend was channel surfing, and we caught her being interviewed on Oprah and talking about her book.  I was captivated listening to her, so I ended up buying her book.  I could relate to her story, as I've experienced an eating disorder throughout my life.  The pain of it can be \\"unbearable\\", to say the least.  It becomes all-consuming like other addictions do.  I highly recommend this book, especially to those who want a better understanding of eating disorders, and the pain of hiding who you are, as she did with her sexuality.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I was moved to write this review after perusing an online list of romantic movies (due to the approach of Valentine's Day) which included this film.  This movie was given the tag line: \\"Ever wish you could erase the memory of a failed romance?\\"  Unfortunately, the characters in this film surcome to such a temptation--with troubling results.  Jim Carry once again shows himself to be an excellent dramatic actor as he relives his volatile romance with his onetime kooky girlfriend played by Kat Winslet.  This movie also features winning performances by Kirsten Dunst as an unwittingly compromised employee of the memory erasing company, and Elijah Woods playing against type as a creepy opportunist.<br /><br />As a counterpoint to this movie, and its proof by contradiction regarding the importance of disfunctional relationships (and their recollection), the admirers of this film should read the poem by Guillaume Apollinaire \\"Le Pont Mirabeau\\" (The Mirabeau Bridge) and contemplate the fleeting nature of such an ephemeral romance.
B0002W18MU|3.0|I was not particularly impressed with this CD.  It was JC singing a lot of other peoples material and I thought it was a bit dark.  Not too bad.  My favorite track was number 2.
0470638842|5.0|Really important information and statistics for this new Boom of Social Networks. I recommend this book to everyone who wants to learn more about Social Networks and Financial themes on that.
0399536108|3.0|I'm not saying this is a bad book to read, nor am I saying it is a great book to read either, but it is quite obvious for people like myself, who read 'The Four-Hour Work Week' first, that Chris has just regurgitated a lot what was already said in that book, and just shown us how he has applied a lot of those principles that he learned from reading that book to his own venture here, and at his blog. That being said, he does promise that a certain percentage of the profit from the sales of this book goes to a charity in Africa, that helps to give the people clean drinking water, so if you find you didn't like this book, at least you have the knowledge of knowing you played a small part in helping there. And you can always come here and write a review if you feel that bad about having bought it. My verdict: An OK read, but if you haven't read 'The Four-Hour Work Week', grab that first and read this afterward, and I think you'll see what I mean here. All in all, this is a fine example of a guy trying to put what he learned from reading 'The Four-Hour Work Week' into practice in his own life.
030746363X|1.0|I could write 50 pages on what's wrong with this book but I won't waste my time.  If you've never worked out a day in your life and truly don't care about getting the body's required daily nutrients then this book might help you look a little better for about a week.  For the rest of us this is useless.
0679437223|4.0|When I picked up this book, I had already written a long journal on my military experiences in Iraq and I wished to see how Heller's novel would parallel real life. He was, of course, right on--that's another confirmation that this book is required reading for all military bureaucrats. The various quagmires and contradictions are fleshed out admirably in his characters. I especially love the Chaplain, who is described in one chapter in masterful literary way. Everything in this book is \\"true true!\\" So you have to read it knowing that the ridiculous fiction is a parallel of real life experience, told in a surreal way. He did a nice job with stream of consciousness that was not as overkill as in the other novel, Something Happened. If you are in the Military, make this book your next purchase and plan on re-reading the book seveal times. I can't imagine a better present to send a soldier in Iraq or Afghanistan. The ending is perfect, the beginning is awkward so you have to power through! I give four stars only because I felt he could have done even better with a couple issues, and he tends to hammer home his points just a little bit too forcibly. So what! Just buy it and start reading it tonight.
0312600844|4.0|Like the book but don't like that Amazon said my bank had declined the payment. I ordered it again and they emailed me again saying my bank decline the payment. Next day, they took out 2 payments! They blame the seller & the seller blames me & I blame Amazon.  Why would they tell me my bank declined the payment and then sub it out to two different sellers? The seller will not refund my money even though I refused the book and they got it back. I want my money from the second payment back!
B00428ZRFE|5.0|For a 45 year old fart like me, I am just amazed by each and every album that Rihanna comes out with, each one being better than the prior.  If she keeps it up at this rate, there might be a day when her sales pass up the Dire Straits or The Rolling Stones, as she started so young.  I am sick and tired of hearing that Rihanna's music is geared to teenagers or young unsophisticated music fans.  This is a 5 AND A HALF STAR album.  The youth, the power, the confidence, the amazing voice, the changing untempo beats, the reggae roots, the sound mixing...it all comes together perfectly here.  Nice collaboration with Eminem.  This is some real life music for real people who live real lifes and have lived in the real world.  No sugar coating on this album.  It is just pure platinum.   Damn good album...I think some Grammy Awards might be in order here.  Buy this album.

1433515164|1.0|As a student of the Bible, I was impressed with the reviews this edition received here and the obvious time and attention given to the production of this volume.  Handsome, too!  Until you open the book and discover woven into the serious commentary near laughable and breathtakingly ignorant smears against a variety of beliefs, including chapters on \\"religious cults\\" (including mainstream denominations), \\"The Bible and Islam\\", sections on the apostasy of Eastern traditions...one could go on.  Several of the 'Articles and Resources' in this work, so potentially useful, are cheapened and rendered unreliable by the thread of fundamentalist bigotry that underpins the supplemental material.  It is simply too 'colored' and biased to be trusted, and too offensive to keep in my own library. (Looks great on the outside, though!)
0307454541|3.0|This book was ok, and by \\"ok\\", I mean slow and boring.  Sure, there were moments where it was interesting, but then boredom and forcing myself to turn the page would set in.  This lasted throughout the ENTIRE book.  So much so, that I deleted the other Larsson books from my Kindle.  What's the point, anyway?  A great read by a great author should have you enjoying your read, fliping those pages whilst being completely absorbed in the story.  This book did not do that.  Don't waste your time.  On to \\"Under the Dome\\"  woot woot!
0312600844|1.0|This book is 500 pages of waste of time.  Utterly depraved characters.  Inadequate or useless metaphors.  The Corrections was pretty good but this one sucks.
B0041KKYCY|3.0|**Spoilers. Ok, as a Woman I thought it was an overall well made Film. That being said Rape Scene lasted WAYYYY TOO long. My Husband was about to the point of forwarding but it ended. The Revenge was Cool and WAYYYY justified. Unrealistic how she lived out there for an entire month!??! Come on! 100% better than the original.
0060832819|5.0|The Zahir is even better than Coelho's previous novels. It has the elements of suspense, romance, and character as well as a deep, provocative spiritual theme. It's well worth any discriminating novel-reader's time.
0307341577|3.0|The worst part is that this was such a great book. The characters are fascinating, the story it sets up is gripping. While I was reading this, I loved it. You can't help but be disgusted with most of the characters at some point or another, but you can feel for them too. They feel like real, flawed people. They're what drives the story.   Libby's struggle is what makes the story more than just a crime mystery. She an unlikeable character, but she has every reason to be. You can't help but want things to work out for her.   Her mother is a desperate woman trying to raise her four children on almost no money and little time.   Ben is a troubled teenage boy who wants too much to be better than he feels he is, and to be loved. He wants to be accepted and thought of as a man, but mostly he is just ignored or outright abused by the people around him. Even with the possibility that he is a murderer (I won't tell you if he is or not, but if you've read the sympnosis, you should already know that it's a possibility), he is the kind of kid that you can't help but want to succeed. He may not be the main character, but he steals the show.   The tragedy and the quest for the truth about a murder in the family is a solid plot that works so well throughout most of the book. The problem is the ending. It doesn't make any sense at all with everything that's happened so far. The last few chapters are all over the place. The conclusion is a huge disappointment that makes it hard to look back fondly on all the wonderful things that came before.
0525244581|5.0|My book arrived way before estimated, and is in excellent condition.  Thanks for being top notch in a world where medocrity is more common.  I will order from you again!
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|Works reasonably well--I use it with the Zoom H1.  The mid-range (1-2K) is a little harsh, with slight distortion once you get your levels to where you'd like them. I also do a little EQ to cut the mid range.  So, this isn't a great tool for pros aiming for high production values.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />This is way better than the built-in mics for just about any video camera mainly because you can get it up close to your actor or talent.  For ~$20 for this mic and ~$99 for a Zoom H1, you can really step up the audio quality in your videos.  Just be sure to keep your expectations realistic.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|I just watched Let Me In last night and I was quite impressed.  I'm not a big fan of vampire movies, especially with the current \\"Twilight\\" type vampire movies hitting the theatres, but I liked Let Me In.  Chloe Moretz continues to amaze me.  So much talent.  This movie will make you think and stay involved.  The only thing I didn't quite get was that it was set in New Mexico.  I lived in New Mexico and, aside from this year, don't remember it ever snowing.  The lakes and ponds never froze over and there was zero interest in hockey.  Other than that, sit back, turn out the lights and enjoy this movie.  I did.
B0017I1FP8|2.0|This review was originally meant to be a response to Rhea Stuart's review, but it got kinda long so I just decided to make it my own review.    I agree with your review, in fact I've used the same word to describe it. \\"Noise\\". Not all of it, but about %60-70 of it. It's not a bad score at all, it really works for the tone of the movie. But music takes on a life of his own when you put it on a album. And this commentary is about the album. Here is where a scores greatest strengths and weaknesses are revealed from a artistic musical stand point. There are many lengthy sections of the Dark Knight that aren't musical, I know it works in the movie, but it shouldn't have been on the soundtrack album. I can't figure out in what way I'm supposed to listen to it. I can't relax to it, hum a tune, or even remember it when its over. In fact I think only a disturbed person would sit through and enjoy many of these tracks. The dark atmospheric tension of wallpaper sounds just  drives me in a moody depression.  All I can imagine is Hans Zimmer sitting in the studio meandering on a keyboard at the wee hours of the morning with a bottle of scotch applying very little effort into what he's doing . In fact I think that's exactly how he found the \\"Joker's \\"theme\\". He must have passed out and as his head rested on the keyboard, the computer recorded this sustained note. Now he thinks he's genius! But compare what he did with what co composer James Newton Howard was doing!  I really wish James Newton Howard had scored the entire film. Them working on Batman Begins was an interesting and more successful experiment, but on the Dark Knight it's clearly a gimmick. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Hans Zimmer fan especially of the pre-Peacemaker era. But James Newton Howard clearly out classes anything Hans Zimmer has ever done.    Now there is a decent, 35 or so minutes of music on the Dark Knight soundtrack barred among 50 or so minutes of noise. And that's just my main issue, the album is just too long to enjoy. It should have been trimmed to focus only on the highlights of the score, not the movie, and for the sake of a coherent listening expereince on an album.  The rest of music should have been left for that 2 CD limited edition, most people agree that album isn't worth it because the best material was on the regular release.
B004JVXTL8|5.0|I liked this one better than the first movie. It gave me goosebumps and made me jump alot. It also helps if you actually believe in the paranormal like i do.
0802136834|5.0|I just finished \\"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\\" yesterday.  All I can say is \\"Wow!!\\".  Alison Weir has thoroughly researched each wife and can back up what she says.  Very indepth.  I feel like I have a better understanding of what really happened.  Not just a condensed made for tv version.

B000N3ST7A|4.0|I am not really a Stevie Nicks fan. I wanted to purchase the song \\"Leather and Lace\\" which she originally had written for Waylon Jennings. So I purchased this CD.

0375850864|5.0|I loved this book so much, when I reached the last page, I turned right back to page one and read it again.<br /><br />This is a story told by a girl named Miranda, who lives in New York City during the late 1970s.  She is telling her story to someone, but we are not quite sure who until the last few pages.  This mysterious person sends her a series of four cryptic notes.  The first one starts, \\"I am coming to save your friend's life, and my own.\\" The notes that follow are even more enigmatic, as they include knowledge of events that haven't happened yet, and hints of traveling a far distance.  Miranda isn't sure who is watching her, or what is going to happen if she doesn't comply with his requests, but she does know, \\"There are days when everything changes, and this was one of those days.\\"<br /><br />When You Reach Me came onto my radar when it won the Newbery Medal. Past winners have included The Graveyard Book by Niel Gaiman and The Tale of Despereaux by Kate DiCamillo, two of my favorite children's books.  So, when this one became available at the library, I scooped it up and devoured it (twice) in one day.<br /><br />I don't want to give anything away, so consequently this will probably be the shortest review I have ever written:  go read this book.  It's lovely and memorable and quotable and one you will want to share.<br /><br />Also, Rebecca Stead is currently on tour (and coming to a book store near me!!!), so check out her website and dates.<br /><br />Rebeccas Stead Website<br /><br />When You Reach Me has also been awarded the following honors:<br />The ALA Top Ten Best Books for Young Adults (2010)
030746363X|5.0|I'll come out in the open right off the bat and say that I am a loyal follower of Tim's work: his other book [[ASIN:0307465357 The 4-Hour Workweek, Expanded and Updated: Expanded and Updated, With Over 100 New Pages of Cutting-Edge Content.]]as well as his blog.<br /><br />There have of course been many reviews of this product already, thanks to other loyal readers like myself, so I won't go specifically into why this book earned a spot in \\"If I could only take 2 books with me to a desert Island\\" slot. The advice is great, and very doable for most people.<br /><br />What I want to say about this book that may not have been considered yet is the adherence factor. Honestly, any diet will work for a certain amount of time, as will most exercise routines. The question is, will you actually do it, and will you make the famed \\"lifestyle change\\" to make the changes stick.<br /><br />This is where Tim comes in. Tim Ferriss's tone in his writing makes you feel like he is right there next to you. He is very down to earth, and explains things in a way that makes sense. There is an entertainment value to the book that makes you curious what the results of \\"self-expirementation\\" could be for you. The entertaining and easy to read tone alone is worth the price of the book. The simplicity of his suggestions makes this foolproof plan for health one that I have not only been able to follow, but have actually incorporated as an element of my life that I am proud of, and derive enjoyment from.<br /><br />I could go on about how important this book has been to me (and now my girlfriend and mom too) but the point of this review was to be direct and perhaps point out something that many of the reviewers are missing. Buy this book because it is written by a talented author that will engage you enough to WANT to follow his advice.
B002JVWR4A|3.0|Watching the season, I was able to catch up parts of episodes missed.  The ending was neat where they promise to meet one year later at the Washington Mall.  Exactly how season 5 began.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie! I have watched it too many times to recall and yet it thrills me each and every time. The actor's portrayal of these beloved characters is simply delightful. You can't help but fall in love with Mr. Darcy and hope that Lizzie will too. The beautiful scenery and music makes it even more of a pleasure to watch. The rain scene is one of my favorites. I wanted them to kiss and realize they were meant for each other. The ending is absolutely perfect in every way. I highly recommend this movie and would give it more than 5 stars if I could.
B002N5N5M0|3.0|John Lithgow makes an excellent bad guy.  I enjoyed the mirror image of the two lives of the serial killers.  Dexter's attempt to manage all parts of his life only lead up to the surprise ending.  I was totally blown away.
B001E5CH0G|4.0|I've been waiting for this to go on sale and glad I got it just in time for the holidays.
B0000VD04M|5.0|This film is at times hilarious, sad, moving, and fascinating.  You have a guy with vision, but without talent, who surrounds himself with adoring misfits while he wheedles his way into making some of the worst films in history.  It is a unique ensemble, from his girlfriend Dorothy (later a successful pop songwriter) and a washed-up Bela Lugosi to Vampira and a cast of little-knowns who are nonetheless utterly captivating.  Wood is in one of the ultimate shark towns, Hollywood, where he dreams of making it big.<br /><br />The emotional center of the film is the friendship he builds with Lugosi, who is played to perfection by Martin Landau in perhaps the finest performance of his career.  Lugosi is at the end:  a morphine addict, his wife having left him, and no work.  Wood approaches him as you would a god, enticing him into a strange film he is making about his transvestism.  While they use eachother, the basis of their friendship appears real.<br /><br />Of course, Wood himself is a weird mix of vaunting ambition and near-fatal incompetence.  He is a mix of contradiction:  a transvestite who loves women, with a knack for finding investors despite persistent failure, an inspired storyteller with nothing worthwhile to say.  Only in Hollywood could such a person create a niche for himself and survive into the cult status he rightly occupies.  The ride is truly great fun, yet pathetic and full of pathos.  The acting in this in uniformly first rate.<br /><br />Tim Burton is quite a presence in our house, mostly from the kids' side.  This is the first film of his that I liked better than the kids, whose empathy for Wood often held back their laughs.
1400052173|5.0|This is an incredibly powerful book. The story itself is wrought with everything life can throw at us: discrimination, disease, human misery, greed, happiness, courage, perseverance and luck (and of course, many, many more). Skloot's writing style puts you in the shoes of everyone involved in the story and compels readers to not put the book down.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Intensely compelling plot, admirable and brave heroine. This one will make you care.<br /><br />May be a YA novel, but intense enough for any adult. Unforgettable.
B00003CXBH|5.0|This film is a true masterpiece. I easily place it within my top 100 films of all time. The story is very human, and while some reviewers think this picture is a critique of faith, particularly the Catholic Church, I do not agree. Yes colonialism had its problems and was a flawed vehicle for the Gospel, but the Indians came to beautiful faith genuinely. Also the priests had an abiding love for these Indians as people, not as mere numbers to add to their scrolls. Real faith is not something which can be forced. And in the end of the movie the Indians and priests give one of the most compelling and loving scenes of martyrdom I have ever witnessed on film. Yes it is sad how they are cut down, but they gain far more than they lose, and in doing so show that true faith cannot be destroyed. I should state that I'm a Protestant, but I have known priests, and the character Jeremy Irons plays reminds me of several dear priests I've encountered. DeNiro gave probably the best performance of his career in this film, the only other contender would be \\"Deer Hunter\\". The scene when they reach the top of the mountain and the Indian cuts off the dead weight of the armor (symbolic of the guilt and anguish he'd be carrying over his brother's death) and DeNiro breaks down and expresses sorrow and finally joy it is truly sublime! Ennio Morricone's music beautifully complements the film (both in pacing and detail) and shows his preeminence amongst film composers! I should also comment on the film's lush cinematography. No wonder it won an Oscar for it. You are transported into the heart of the jungle. I recommend this film in the strongest possible terms. Please see it and you will not regret the time spent!
B000JMLFLW|2.0|Vapid and pompous! Despite the clever rhetoric, the plot and characters are simply too shallow, predictable and archetypical. Yes, this novel is a classic, and an original of the romance genre, but that doesn't make up for the fact that it, in fact, is romance genre: WAY to simplistic.<br /><br />Couldn't stand the book, not when I read it at 20 and not when I gave it another chance at 49. Disappointing because I loved the movie \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" (with Kate Winslet, Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman), so I thought I would like the author.<br /><br />And yes, I do love Dickens. Despite her myriad adoring fans, in my opinion, Jane Austen's writing lacks depth and cannot truly be compared to Dickens.
0525951652|5.0|My purchase of the \\"Fall of Giants\\" was delayed primarily by my looking at the average customer review rating of this book.  I kept putting it off and putting it off, thinking there were so many other higher rated books to read.  My wife brought the book home from the 7-day loaned books from our local library and I couldn't put the book down, that is until the power went out in our home for three days and nights.  Not being able to finish this in the one-week limit, I then went searching for my own copy. I have read all of Ken Follett's books with my all time favorite being \\"Pillars of the Earth\\", but first learning of the author via \\"Eye of the Needle\\".  \\"Fall of Giants\\", is fantastic because it is historical fiction with events running throughout the work.  The characters are all unforgettable and their paths cross one another across cultures, classes and geographies.  I am nearly finished with this book as I write this review and honestly can't wait until Ken Follett releases the subsequent two books.  Don't pass this book up just because it doesn't currently have five stars.
B003O86FMW|4.0|How does Suzanne Collins do it? Another gripping page-turner. Gripping arena action and the great new characters.<br /><br />However, I felt cheated by the ending, or should I say total lack of ending? Books 2 and 3 should have been combined into one book. Felt like a publisher swindle. That's the only reason this book doesn't have 5 stars.
0312370849|5.0|If you are interested in the Holocaust and the horrendous suffering of the common Jewish family, read this book!  Your heart breaks but you realize so fully the suffering of these people,the insane absurdness of Hitler and his men, and the absolute necessity of being on guard against this ever happening again.  Sarah's Key is incredibly sad but more than worthwhile read.
0756405890|2.0|I was bored. Something wrong with the character development here. I don't know if the main character is too smug or what, but I just couldn't get to like him. The entire book is cliche after cliche. Yikes.

1423101499|5.0|This is an exciting book written with guys in mind. It is easy to get the girls to read, but a whole other story when trying to excite the boys. This book does it with plenty of suspense and fighting and just enough romance!
B004IYDS8A|5.0|We are so in love with the TV series Modern Family. Honestly it's about the only TV show we religiously record and watch.  There are SO many good episodes but this one is probably the best ever. There are so many 1-liners you have to watch it twice to really get the full effect. This was the first time in a long time that I've been laughing so hard during a TV show that I had to pause it!  :)
0061997811|5.0|I have a strict rule in our household:  If you want to see the movie, you have to read the book first.  My son (8) and daughter (5) have been interested in Harry Potter since the Wii game landed in our household at Christmas-time.  That interest was augmented by the fact that they know my husband and I went to see \\"The Deathly Hollows\\" without them.  Consequently,  we began reading a chapter or two per night (beginning with Book One, of course) and are now about half-way through the second book, The Chamber of Secrets.  The books are a huge hit with both kids who sit transfixed during our evening reading times, hanging on every word.  I love that.<br /><br />Enter this Film Wizardry book.  This book is chock-full of full-color photos of the characters as they appear in the movies, complete with bios and details about each one.  It has a pull-out copy of Harry's letter notifying him of his acceptance to Hogwarts, a fold-out copy of The Marauder's Map, entire spreads dedicated to the locations and sites in each book and more.  Even for a couple of kids who have not seen the movies yet, it has proven to be the perfect visual companion to our readings.  At the end of each reading, they bolt for this book (which they now keep at the foot of the stairs so they don't even have to run all the way up to retrieve it), and look up the places and people they \\"met\\" during our reading time that night.  For our purposes, I was a bit worried about spoilers since it contains the characters and places from all of the movies.  But instead, it has just produced an occasional \\"AHA!\\" moment when we read a passage that calls to mind something they've seen in the Film Wizardry book.  There are even preview shots from the yet-to-be-released final movie.<br /><br />Fans (young and old alike) who have already read the books and seen the movies will also love this visual guide and the walk down memory lane it provides.  It is loaded with  movie \\"ephemera\\" above and beyond what I've already mentioned (Yule Ball tickets,  Ministry ID booklets, labels from Slughorn's Apothecary, copies of declarations from the Ministry of Magic, and on and on).  Film Wizardry a visual and hands-on dream come true for Harry Potter enthusiasts.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: The most imaginative and complete Harry Potter companion book on the market.

030746363X|5.0|I'm not going to go into a chapter-by-chapter breakdown of the book; that's already been done more than a few times in the 830+ reviews.  The slow-carb diet Tim describes in great detail makes the book worthwhile just by itself.  His meticulousness and no-nonsense approach makes it a simple, easy-to-use manual for fast, safe, and enjoyable weight loss.  That he treated himself as the guinea pig (as opposed to the \\"during a scientific survey, X% of people reported...\\") just makes it all the more believable and enjoyable to read.  Check out the comments on Tim's site from people that are successfully using the slow-carb diet - it'll make a believer out of you.  I have personally had an incredible experience with it.<br /><br />Bottom line: get the book.  You NEED it.
0812550706|5.0|It is a rare and impressive feet when a book causes me to lose sleep but that is exactly what Ender's Game did. I know this book has been around for nearly seventeen years but I'm just now stumbling upon Orson Scott Card. The way that you are brought into the world of Ender Wiggins and how he overcomes every obstacle and person in his way was a delight to read.<br /><br />The setting of the training school and the military game that the children are forced to play is imaginatively thought out causing me to get lost in a whole other world. You are connected immediately to this boy's feelings and struggles from page one. I can't say enough about the pace and insight into the writing of Mr. Card and I look forward to reading more on this series. This is classic sci-fi at it's finest and I encourage those who love the genre will not be disappointed. I give this book a 5 out of 5 star rating.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Daniel L Carter<br />Author of The Unwanted Trilogy

0765301598|3.0|These books are the literary equivalent of fast food: sometimes tasty and filling, but not of high quality.  The writing continues to be terrible, with its hop-scotch short chapters, trite similes (some of which should be on those internet lists of examples from bad high school papers), deadening repetition, impoverished descriptive abilities, and rudimentary, shallow characterization.  On the other hand, the stories themselves are actually quite good, for the most part; although about half of the sub-plots could have been jettisoned to the benefit of the series.  The books have a relatively high entertainment value, which makes them worth a read notwithstanding the lousy writing.  They are what I would call a \\"good airport read.\\"    WARNING - SPOILER:  The machines, \\"Evermind\\" Omnius and his \\"independent robot\\" sidekick Erasmus, are the weakest part of the series.  Omnius in particular is almost comically inept, which reduces his stature as a lethal cosmic villain.  And Erasmus, with his attempts to understand humans and his mimicry of human attributes, comes across as an unlikable derivative of Lieutenant Data from \\"Star Trek: TNG.\\"  Alas, these feeble villains reappear in the final books of the Herbert/Anderson series, about 13,000 years later.  They do not improve with time.

B001RL4K1Q|1.0|I actually like this movie quite a bit but I was a fool and didn't check out any of the features the blu ray version had before buying it.  There is none, zero, zilch.  Every feature that is on the 2004 collectors edition should be on this.  I hate to sound petty its not a big deal in the grand scheme of life I just felt like they should of added all those extras with all the room blu rays have. Movie itself is 5 stars.

B0048LPRCS|2.0|Why is it the so called \\"classic movies\\" or soon to be are always the most boring? The cover looks amazing and I thought it would be a nice movie, but no action, no comedy, no horror, no suspence.....whats left? Well Drama ofcourse and its not like \\"Bad Girls Club\\" drama, just a plot to tie the whole thing together, but I don't like it and am glad I found it online instead of paying for it which I almost did. Perfect example of not judging a book (or movie in this case) by its cover.
B004FEFZU2|2.0|My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.<br /><br />The 3D in this movie is mainly a depth field (inside the screen), punctuated with 6, split second out of screen effects that extend 30% to 60% of the way, from the screen to the viewer. However they happen so fast you may not even realize the have happened. Other than red dots floating during the intro, and a few gun tips, the best OOS effect is 2 seconds long at 7:20 minutes, of a power saw.<br /><br />***  The lack of out of screen effects left me feeling cheated and parallax problems in quite a few scenes made it worse.  ***<br /><br />***  This is NOT a movie to show off your 3D system with.  ***<br /><br />MY 3D RATING = FAIR  (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)<br /><br />Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different.

078322947X|5.0|This has been an all-time favorite since I saw it at Scottsdale's long-gone Kachina Theater in 1977. Like many fans, I've found the pan-and-scan DVD that's been around for over a decade underwhelming, but as it's the only way to watch this overlooked masterpiece, I've put up with it.    Great news for fans: William Friedkin is currently supervising a new Blu-ray edition of his film, which should be ready for release at the end of this year, or early next. Stay tuned for Amazon pre-ordering when the official release date is announced!
B0045I3EJC|5.0|This movie is very complex and has an amazing story behind it. Jared Leto does an excellent job playing all of the different lives of \\"Nemo Nobody\\" - so glad it became available for the U.S. I've been waiting a long time!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I dont understand all the negative reviews undoubtedly coming from people who have the attention span of the Jersey shore generation and otherwise feel like they are falling into a coma if things aren't moving at MTV pace. This movie was so well written and acted, thoughtful, genuine, touching and incredibly romantic that any negative review I see must stem from the audience simply not understanding this movie. Of course if you want some rom-com, bang-wang predictable formula, this wont be the movie for you. The beauty of this piece lies in the subtleties of the performances and the portrayal of the characters. Bill Murray has outdone himself in terms of acting skill. He is superb in his role as the apathetic, bored, middle-aged movie star stuck in the artificial confines of some luxury hotel in Tokyo to do a whiskey commercial. He is always in character and he never, ever becomes Bill Murray for even just one second, resulting in a believable and powerful performance. This part was written for him and I doubt any other actor could have pulled off what he did. Scarlett Johansson has an innocence to her that is only complemented by her intelligence and the serenity she exhumes. They could not have cast anyone better for this part. In fact, Murray and Johansson have great chemistry, despite the almost thirty five years age difference between them.     Murray plays Bob Harris. He's married and has children, but he feels stuck and tired. He is in Japan to do a commercial for money but his heart is not in it and he's lost his drive and seems mostly on autopilot when going about his business. His marriage is stagnant and his wife keeps sending him tile and wall-paper patterns to chose from but other than that doesnt really talk to him really or otherwise shows any interest in him as a person. She just says what needs to be said, like she was closing a business deal, and then hangs up. Charlotte (played by Johansson) is a Yale philosophy graduate in town with her her not particularly bright celebrity photographer husband John to whom she has been married for two years and who doesnt give her the time of day. She reflects on how her husband has changed during two years of marriage and how her own life lacks direction. Her husband, in fact, seems to have more in common with a light-headed starlet they meet in the hotel, than with his own wife. He even tells her that she needs to relax because \\"not everyone went to Yale.\\" He then leaves her behind in the hotel while he is off for his assignment.     People got this movie all wrong believing it to be about the friendship between two lonely people or that it is about traveling to far off lands and being homesick. Far from it. This is a love story. However, that is really beside the point because the beauty of this movie lies in how this love story is told. The protagonists dont do the obvious things expected in such movies like sleep with each other (even though they could) or otherwise have a steamy affair that ends with separation and tears. No. That would have been cheap and predictable.     This movie is about two people who find themselves in the same place and time with contrasting perspectives. Each is afflicted by different yet parallel doubts about the course their life respectively is taking or has taken. These two are drawn to each other and able to be completely honest and unguarded with the other BECAUSE they are strangers without any messy attachment from the past. The conversations they have are at the heart of this and their loneliness is compounded by the noisy, chaotic, neon-filled Tokyo background which I think - despite crowds - is a very isolating and lonely place really.     I loved this movie because it threw two unlikely people together and forged an unexpected, intense relationship. It is a story that is mostly about the things that aren't said and done, than about what is explicitly uttered. The ending is powerful because when he whispers something in her ear onthe congested streets of Tokyo, we don't get to hear what it is nor do we ever find out. The effect is a strong ending that is not predictable but remains true to the film's elegance, subtlety and depth. As someone once said, maybe he gave her his phone number, or said he loved her. Or said she was a good person. Or thanked her. Or whispered, \\"Had we but world enough, and time...\\" and left her to look up the rest of it.
B000W91RUG|2.0|Where's the humor?  I get this is a popular show and several people told me they liked it but it totally fell flat for me.  I suffered through one episode and then tossed the DVD into a black hole.  HUMOR: D minus; STORY/PLOTTING: C plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus; OVERALL GRADE: D plus to C minus; WHEN WATCHED: 02/08/2011.
0446563048|5.0|Most business book suck. This one does not.     How many other books have been written about start-ups? A lot.  How many are written by the entrepreneur himself? Few.  How many are written by the entrepreneur about the company he has helped sell for >$1 billion? This one.    (Even \\"Good-to-Great\\" - the book that Tony promotes - panders. It offers no useful business advice.)     In telling us how he arrived at a happy and profitable relationship with Amazon, Tony recounts his life from his earliest business as a child through Harvard. In his prose, you will realize a humbling, tempered, yet spirited entrepreneurial spirit (yes this is redundant). The kind that uplifts others to strive for more.    Like great literature, this book tells a riveting story with morals about the \\"good\\" side of business. Unlike great literature, the book's advice is directly applicable.    The last chapter on \\"Happiness\\" was most poignant. Whether you yourself are not an entrepreneur or in the business world, the structured way that he approaches happiness makes rational and emotional sense to being \\"happy\\", \\"successful\\" in whatever you pursue.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|An amazing book.  Very fast-paced and exciting.  Full of adventure.  Great characters that you can believe in.
B000BNI90O|3.0|I'd love to love this, but it's not available, although the recordings for the other two movies are.<br />I'm embarrassed to admit that I wasn't aware of these recordings before now.  Nevertheless, I find it difficult to believe the ROTK has MP3 downloads available, and FOTR is \\"out of stock\\".<br />I am deeply disappointed, and hope this will be remedied soon.
B002ZG999U|5.0|Such a good movie! Great for all sexes! Me and my husband both love this film! I hope they make a sequel!
B00004XMTJ|1.0|I purchased the Commemorative edition December 9, 2010. Just tried to watch it last night. Unfortunately, the disc got to a certain point and would NOT continue playing. Tried to go to Amazon to return it, but...no go, my deadline for returning it was January 31st. So I've wasted money on a defective disc.  Be wary of purchasing the commemorative edition folks!
B000VJAICK|5.0|Such a good movie. My only complaint, I wish the dvd box was the same size as a standard dvd box.  Great movie thought, a cult classic! If you love Kevin Bacon or Reba you need to own this one!
0316044695|5.0|This compelling story told through the eyes of a U.S. Navy SEAL is one of the best that I have ever read. Marcus Luttrell did a great job of telling the true story of an unfortunate incident in Afghanistan in which his whole SEAL team was killed and he alone survived. From the moment I started reading I had a hard time putting the book down. The book takes readers through Luttrell's training, deployment to Afghanistan, and his amazing survival thanks to the local tribes of the mountains. Marcus Luttrell is truly a hero, and I would like to thank him for having the strength to go on and honor his fallen friends' memories by telling their heroic tale. Stories like this show the American people the bravery and courage of our fine troops serving over seas.
0756656230|4.0|Bought for my young son who also loves the Star Wars Lego books. One of the few things he reads of his own accord. A thorough history for adult fans too. Cheaper at WHSmith online, but not always clear on availability.
B0000669JL|5.0|I was in college at his peak in the mid-late 70's but Marley wasn't really played much in the places I frequented. Too bad. This introduction to his works really opened my eyes and ears to his genius. While the spiritual meanings of many of his songs were obviously important to him, I simply enjoy the music for its own sake. This album provides a fantastic exposure to his works. I've since acquired several other of his albums and they are in a regular rotation on my iPod.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|I have to say that this was one of the most impressive productions I have seen in a very long time. Well acted for the most part, good cosutme and sets (though if you look closely, you can see some scrimping on sets), and generally true to the Dickens book. Tom Courtenay is outstanding, as is Claire Foy. Claire plays Amy Dorrit, and is charming. One fault that might be found is that she is actually a bit large to be Little Dorrit, mainly in terms of height, but that is a small point to overlook. I feel that both Macfayden and Foy did an excellent job of finding the center of their characters, and thus neither sublimating them nor going \\"over the top\\" with acting. If there was any point I could find fault with, it would be that the French murderer (forgot his name, at the moment) was a bit too much like a really evil Maurice Chevalier, seemed to play the part a bit TOO French. Overall, though, if you like Charles Dickens, Britlit, costume drama, and a bit of romance, you will not be disappointed with this. I note also that I am not alone in my praise, one of the most popular online rating sites gives Little Dorrit a very high score, as well.
B001EOOQEM|4.0|This is the first and best album with Dio. All the songs are very good with the exception of Heaven and Hell which is excellent. Its not like the classic albums with Ozzy (the first 6 albums) but it has another atmosphere. Itds more heavy and not so <<doom>> lets say. Personally i prefer old Black Sabbath but this album is also a very good album. For all metal fans
B003CJJYLM|5.0|Breaking Bad is hands down the best show on TV I've ever seen in four decades of watching television.  Worth owning and watching every episode... Only suggestion i would make is do yourself a favor and watch it from the pilot thru in order... will mean so much more to the audience.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|I was jonesing for some new music, and I saw this album was nominated for a grammy. I haven't heard any TP in awhile, but I liked his stuff from the '80's. This is a really good album. It has an old school, stripped down, rock feel, with nods to genres like reggae and blues. Listening to it was a great surprise. It's not the band I remember, but at the same time it is.
B001GCUNYO|2.0|I loved this movie from the first time I saw it. I enjoyed the non stop action from start to finish and Liam gives a great performance. So, I bought the DVD release. Then I bought a Blu Ray player recently and decided I would not re-buy Blu Rays of all of my DVDs except for a select few that I watch most of the time. Naturally, Taken was one of those movies so I bought the Blu ray disc. Unfortunately the picture quality in some scenes, notably night scenes, seem to actually be worse than the DVD version. The night scenes have more grain to them and there are scenes where there is a distinct horizontal line through the middle of the screen where the colors are actually different above and below the line. This is most notable in the night scenes. I even exchanged the Blu Ray thinking there was no way they would actually release that and the disc must be defective, but the replacement is exactly the same way. I compared scene by scene on the same blu ray player the blu ray and DVD and actually recommend the DVD version of the film. Sure, the day scenes are not as crisp as the Blu Ray, but it is more than made up for in the night/dark lighting scenes. If this movie was my only impression of blu ray movies, I would steer clear, but fortunately, I know blu ray is generally a much better media than DVD.    So, in summary, unless this Blu Ray is much cheaper than its DVD counterpart, I would recommend the DVD over the Blu Ray. 5 star movie, 1 star Blu Ray.
0446679089|5.0|A sort of modern day version of Film Noir meets Action Movie. Blend together the smarmy talk of an old Bogart mystery (only with more modern chauvinism)with bordering on unbelievable action of a Willis in Die Hard and you get the sort of story and suspense that DeMille has put together.<br /><br />The \\"more modern\\" language of the book is a turn off to some, as our hero is more straightforward descriptive and less prone to using the phrases that have become running jokes of Noir (i.e. \\"She was no longer wearing her blazer, so I could see the .38 caliber she had holstered on her back, and the pair of 38D she had holstered up front\\" rather than the \\"She was as smooth as butter and sizzled like butter melting in a frying pan\\").  John Corey is a chauvinist and full of himself to a degree that may offend those of delicate senses (see most of the low 1 star reviews here and that is the major whine... so if you are one of those types, then this is probably not for you), but is quite realistic to anybody that knows a person like a Cory.<br /><br />This is in no way what you may consider a \\"literary classic\\" and probably fits more in line with a \\"summer read\\" for most people, but the easy read style and flowing dialog made it hard for me (an admitted non finisher of many books), to put it down and I could not wait for my next opportunity to grab it and see what was happening next.<br /><br />The research and facts that DeMille uses about real places, events and people help sell the story to me as it rarely gets too fantastical (though there are some points that like any action book border on the implausible) and helps make it almost seem like more of a dramatization of real events rather than outright fiction.<br /><br />Thoughout my life I have had favorite sleuths, Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew (hey I was a kid), Sherlock Holmes, Ellery Queen, and now John Corey.
B004AHNIGM|3.0|The songs are good choices for Gregg's voice, and his voice is better than it's been in a long time, but the early 1960's monaural production doesn't fit.  Gregg is a product of the 1970's and this album would be much better produced in simple clean 1970's style stereo. Performance = A+, Production = F  T-Bone Burnett ruined this effort.  Tom Dowd is rolling over in his grave.
B0015RRN8O|1.0|Instead of getting both versions of this movie. I ended up with the same disc. Disappointing as I didn't notice it until after the return period was over.
B004GUTMOK|1.0|\\"What the heck\\" is right!  I know it is called scalping and I know everyone wants to make a buck but this is a bit over the top.  Get a grip Amazon and don't let the scalpers push you around.
159562015X|3.0|If you have never had an evaluation like this, you can benefit a great deal from this book and its on-line evaluation. The main value, in my experience, is not so much in knowing what your strengths are, but in having specific guidance about what to do next.     If you have a performance review coming up, borrowing this book (or spending 45 minutes at your local book retailer) might be a particularly useful bit of homework, even if you don't take the test.     What you will NOT get is any information about anything other than your own top 5 strengths. You will not have the opportunity to take a \\"My best self\\" and a \\"My worst self\\" version, and, for most of us, as noted in another review here, these things really ARE different according to the kind of day you're having. Oh yes, you can buy another chance for the price of another book.     I am very cynical about the Gallup Organization's $550 offer to help with \\"managing talents at the bottom of your 34-theme sequence.\\" Which also draws me to the cynical conclusion that if anyone mentions that s/he knows their bottom \\"talent,\\" you are looking at someone who is sooner or later going to give you the opportunity to avial of their expertise in this area.     If you are unemployed, underemployed, and just having a terrible day and are willing to spend $20 for instant gratification/verification of what you probably already know, google this you will be able to find a place to do this instantaneously.     As I came to this page, B&N came up as a popup offering it for a couple bucks less.
0596007124|5.0|I have been trying to learn design patterns for a while now (several years). I have read online, purchased videos, read other books, but still seemed to struggle with really understanding design patterns. My problems is not necessarily code samples, but more of 'why' would I use a specific design pattern or 'when' I should use a design pattern for a project. This book by Head First brings it down to a very real level for most software developers. I am about half way through and I am already using what I have learned in my real code projects that I am working on. I highly recommend this book. I have other Head First books and they have all been excellent.
B0024FAR5M|4.0|I finished up season 1 last night and am chomping at the bit for season 2 to arrive.  This show is  terribly addicting.  While I agree with others here that Jax may be just a bit too shrewd and able for his age and experience, he's the hero and this isn't the first story to give the hero above average abilities.  If he was average, he would have no hope of taking on the challenges ahead.  No point to a show about a guy who can't get things done.  I think Hunnam does a great job in the role and shows a lot of depth and heart in the scenes that matter.  The rest of the cast is awesome too, but Katey Sagal steals the show.  I really can't say enough about her abilities as a dramatic anti-hero female lead.  SOA wouldn't be the same without her.  The pacing is good, the conflicts are compelling, the action can be intense, and the use of music is inspired.  But what kept me coming back, as it always does, is the human element.  Jax and Tara, Jax and the baby, Gemma and Jax,  Gemma and Clay, Opie and his family, Hale and Unser.  It seems in the midst of chaos, the essense of what it is to be human keeps shining through.  Ultimately SOA appears to be more about the inner struggle that accompanies doing what is right versus doing what you know.  If that's something that speaks to your sensibilities, you should give this a try.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|This Star Trek movie tells how the crew got its start and gives us a glimpse of the characters we have come to love as they were getting their starts in Star Fleet. It does a very nice job of tying things together and setting the stage for some possible new movies that would tell about earlier adventures of the original cast of characters. The movie brings in one of the original characters, Spock, where the young version and the old version meet.<br /><br />The casting was very successful in capturing some of the mannerisms of the original cast; I was particularly impressed with Karl Urban's portrayal of Bones, he did an outstanding job of capturing the accent and mannerisms used by DeForest Kelley in the original series.<br /><br />An effort is made to explore the personal strengths and weaknesses of the characters that help the viewer, who is familiar with the series, to see how they came to be and accomplish what the later stories reveal.<br /><br />The Blu-ray version offers the good video and audio that one expects from the medium and the story is filled with fast paced action that holds one's attention.<br /><br />The financial success of this movie seems to guarantee sequels starting in 2012 according to reports I've read; this seems to bode well for all Star Trek fans!
B004G8ZZHU|2.0|As an action movie this was entertaining, but the only similarity it had to what made the orginal A-Team great was the fact that there are 3 white guys and 1 black guy.  I grew up watching the A-Team and if you compare this movie to one of their episodes \\"THIS MOVIE IS LAME!!!\\"
B001HPP2XW|3.0|Do NOT buy this from \\"supermoviedeals.\\" Defective DVD, worst customer service ever. This piece of garbage still won't play. I want a replacement!!!!!
0446569909|5.0|This was a very informative and wonderful book that actually gives the truth and not gossip.  I would recommend this book to any an all Ozzy Osbourn bans!  If I could give it more than 5 stars I would.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|The word \\"red\\" is an acronym describing the Bruce Willis character, a retired CIA operative, who remains extremely dangerous. Willis telephones Mary-Louis Parker, a CIA financial clerk, frequently and is attracted to her. He is surprisingly attacked suddenly by a group who try to kill him. But Willis is no ordinary retired operative and is very competent in combat. He overcomes his attackers.<br /><br /> He realizes that the CIA, or some element in the organization, wants to kill him. He understands that the attackers will go after Mary because of his many telephone calls to her. He discovers that other CIA operatives, all associated with one particular mission, have been killed. Despite his abilities, he needs help to find who specifically is trying to kill him and his associates and why.<br /><br /> He rescues Mary and gets help from past CIA operatives who were on the mission: Morgan Freeman, an eighty-year old man living in a nursing home and dying of cancer; John Malkovich, whose mind has been somewhat fried because of his involvement in LSD government experiments: and Helen Mirren, who is a good medic and an expert marksman. He also seeks aid from a past Russian rival, a friend of Helen Mirren.<br /><br /> The plot of the film and its quirky characters have been in many movies, but Red offers very good actors, minor twists in the tale, as well as many comedic elements, that make the film enjoyable.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I love this movie. It's my all time favorite. Having missed it the last two Christmases, I went ahead and bought it. If you don't know this movie and are looking at the reviews, you've lived under a rock. This movie is fantastic, a timeless story about faith, family, love, and the impact one life can have on another.
0380002930|4.0|I just really enjoy this book - once I started it I didn't want to put it down.  A very exciting story, the author warns not to delve too deeply as far as symbolism goes.  I really think it was meant to be an exciting, great yarn of a tale! Enjoy the great storytelling - not sure what age children it would appeal to - I'm 40 and I like it and find it made me jumpy like a rabbit when reading at night!  It was dark and scary at times..I don't know whhat children it would appeal to.  I think I read it for the first time in my early teens.    It's told from a male rabbit perspective  and yes the does are portrayed as raising litters of rabbits, digging the dens, and baby-making but to slam the book as anti-feminism is kind of futile cause that's how rabbits are  i.e breeding like rabbits!!  I think as well less is known about female rabbits as they spend more time underground caring for the kittens...
0393317552|5.0|Excellent review of human migration, food production and growth of societies from hunter gatherer to modern.  Well written. Negative in self conscious politically correct way. Still an excellent study.
B0040LLLMQ|5.0|I really enjoy this series & was going to purchase the Final Season Collectors edition on Amazon for almost $100, but I found the exact same DVD at Best Buy for $49.99. I wasn't able to find it on their website but it was for sale in store. Definately worth buying.
0316044695|5.0|We Americans all too often take our liberty for granted.  Not so our armed forces and incredibly not so, our US Navy SEALs.      Before reading Lone Survivor I'd heard some about the Navy SEAL program without grasping the intensity of it, nor the unrelenting, indomitable spirit required of its graduates.  Well, now I understand -- at least to the extent someone who never has and never will experience it himself can understand, thanks to the efforts of Marcus Luttrell - who lives and embodies the SEAL reality - and Patrick Robinson who helped Marcus write about it.    Lone Survivor chronicles two major sections in Marcus Luttrell's life:  The first, preparation and training to become a US Navy SEAL; the second, the mind boggling story of SEALs in action and specifically about Marcus' survival and return from a SEAL covert mission called \\"Operation Redwing\\" that took place in Afghanastan in 2005.      If you can put the book down at all, the only imaginable place is at the end of the first section and before beginning the second.  I simply can't imagine sleeping before completing either in its entirety.  I personally read it straight through, breaking only for absolute necessities in spite of my kid's screaming for food and attention (and yes, I did feed them).    Not since reading Alfred Lansing's Endurance - about Sir Ernest Shackleford's amazing journey to Antartica and back - have I been so riveted by a story.  Luttrell's commentary about the military's rules of engagement present an honest, painful and human picture of the difficulty making a moral decision between your own life and the life of others (friends, comrades, unarmed bystanders) during wartime circumstance.    If you catch yourself feeling sorry for yourself from all you've suffered, read this book.  I'm betting it'll put a whole new spin on your perspective.    Thanks to Marcus Luttrell and all the US SEALS for their willingess to prepare to such an extent to protect the liberty we enjoy in the United States of America and to Patrick Robinson for helping write this book.    It's great.  Full of insight into the warrior mentality necessary to survive unsurvivable conditions and circumstances.
B002OT7314|1.0|If you can find this CD in a budget bin for a couple of bucks, the song, \\"Highwire\\", a studio track tacked on to the end, is worth the $2.  (There is another studio song that is tacked on at the end but it is forgettable).  The live stuff is okay but the studio versions or other live versions of the songs are better.  Tour merch best forgotten.
B000L3CHC0|1.0|I bought this watch from Amazon Market place., when i opened the pack the TISSOT's warranty was replaced by the seller's \\"Dexclusive\\"., the warranty card was not stamped. When i contacted them ., they said they will waive the 15% restocking fee ., but that was not the case. Just because i bought from these guys i had to loose 15% + my return UPS charges. Think twice before buying the product from the seller.
B0021L8V0W|5.0|Great DVD. Worth getting.<br /><br />I can't believe Angelina Jolie does her own stunts. Looking at the extra features is a real eye-opener - what do they save for the stunt crew? The semi-lethal stuff?
B004IFYN2Y|5.0|This is a great film, with Academy Award worthy performances by Sean Penn and Naomi Watts, which gives me real hope for our country.  It will raise the blood pressure of all who remain appalled by a country that permitted what went on at the highest levels of the American government from 2001 to 2009.  And anyone who dares call this movie 'bogus history' must have been under a rock during the ruinous reign of terror which one euphemistically calls 'The Bush Administration' - or is simply and obediently regurgitating the perverse ignorance of Fox News. Es lebe die Freiheit!  Es lebe Joe Wilson!  Es lebe Valerie Plame!
B0034G4P7G|5.0|I had such low expectations for this film that I didn't even consider seeing it until it won best drama at the Golden Globes -- and even then, I hesitated.  Despite liking director David Fincher's work, the subject matter just didn't seem all that compelling.  But boy, was I wrong!<br /><br />The nonlinear plot flashes back and forth between the litigation facing Facebook Mark Zuckerberg (played perfectly by Jesse Eisenberg) and the evolution of Facebook, first at Harvard and then in California's Silicon Valley.  Well-heeled twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (Armie Hammer in both roles) approach Zuckerberg to help them implement their idea for a Harvard social networking site after Zuckerberg proves his hacking chops in an infamous campus incident.  But Zuckerberg secretly cuts them out and instead develops Facebook with his only friend Eduardo Saverin (played with incredible dignity by Andrew Garfield.)  With interference from Napster's founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), the stakes rise.<br /><br />Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin play up the irony of today's most influential social networking site being founded by a young man with no loyalty, warmth, etiquette, or even social awareness.  Eisenberg's Zuckerberg makes everyone uncomfortable, including the audience, but his narcissistic, painfully awkward personality is riveting the way John Nash's schizophrenia was in A Beautiful Mind: you can't look away because of its complexity and irony.<br /><br />Toss aside any low expectations you have of the subject matter, and give this film a try.  It's well worth seeing, if for nothing else than understanding how the ubiquitous Facebook came to be.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was really skeptical about reading a young adult series. I ordered a sample on my kindle and I was hooked. This is a great furturistic survival story. Katniss(the main character) is a very strong girl. She is thrown into a deadly game of survival of the fittest and smartest. I can't wait to continue the story with the next book!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Bought the first book on a whim.  Best book-decision that I have made in a long time.  This last book kept my attention and I really hated to see the story/series end.  Lisbeth is one of the most interesting and unique characters I have discovered in a very long time.  This series will not disappoint and you will definitely know more about Sweden's geography when you're finished!
B003VWC4AS|5.0|I agree with the other reviewers here about this book; it is indeed a \\"must-read\\". This book is not really a story of rugby, as later portrayed in the Hollywood movie;  it is a story of a country struggling with a massive and long-overdue change in the fabric of its society.    John Carlin tells the story of South Africa during the transition period after Nelson Mandela was freed from prison and apartheid ended. Whether you are an expert in this era or a neophyte, Carlin's writing and summary of this time is nothing short of superb. He is able to tell the tale of how South Africa managed an almost incomprehensibly huge change in its society without warfare, which is an incredible feat. Carlin had worked in South Africa and as such had background knowledge of the country as well as access to the many prominent figures that he interviewed for the book, including Mandela himself.     The role of rugby in this book is as the thread that ties together the characters from all walks of life who appear throughout the story. It doesn't much resemble the movie in that sense, which relied more heavily on showing the rugby team, games, etc., as the primary driver of the story. The book is far more powerful.    Everyone, and I do mean everyone, should read this book. It is well-written, fast-paced, emotional, and tells a story that would have been unbelievable if it weren't true. As a side note, the poem \\"Invictus\\", for which the movie was titled, brilliantly captures the bravery of Mandela and all of South Africa shown in this book.    \\"It matters not how strait the gate,  How charged with punishments the scroll.  I am the master of my fate:  I am the captain of my soul.\\"    Excerpt from Invictus, by William Ernest Henley

0307272702|5.0|I haven't finished reading the book, so this is not a full review. Just want to share some of my current thoughts and experience. I've been health-conscious for the past decade, I run regularly, and I eat very little fats. But I've always had a sweet tooth and enjoyed sweet drinks and desserts. I've always thought it was okay since they are just extra calories that I burn off when I run. Since I started reading this book, about a week ago, I've cut starch and sugars drastically from my diet. I've already lost at least 1 kg. (I don't know for sure as I started weighing myself later.) I'm not a fat person, most people will consider me of average build or less, relative to other people. I followed the ideas in the book for health reasons and to become lean. Right now, I've never been leaner in my entire life. Note that I still eat some rice and some sugar in my coffee, but in 1 week the effects of eating less carbs has trumped all the exercise and low-fat eating I've done before.

B001DXS4E2|5.0|Since \\"Holiday Inn\\" is now considered a Christmas film, it might seem out of season to post a review in February.  However, there are three holidays in February that are highlighted in the film: Lincoln's Birthday, Valentine's Day, and Washington's Birthday, so to me it seems appropriate.    Of course, what forever links this movie to Christmas is the introduction of the classic carol  \\"White Christmas\\" by Bing Crosby.   This not only won the Oscar that year for Best Song, but Crosby's single became one of the Top Five best selling records of all time with over fifty million copies sold according to the Guinness Book of World Records.     Jim Hardy (Bing Crosby), Ted Hanover (Fred Astaire) and Lila Dixon (Virginia Dale) have a successful nightclub act.  On Christmas Eve however Jim has decided to leave the act for good, marry Lila and both of them settle on a Connecticut farm.    The scheming Ted and their slick agent Danny Reed (Walter Abel) have other plans however.  Ted and the fickle Lila who are involved romantically will form a dance partnership and retool the act.   The wounded Jim leaves alone for Connecticut, but finds the role of gentleman farmer involves long hours of backbreaking work.   Instead he comes up with an idea of turning the farm into an inn, \\"Holiday Inn\\" that will only be open on the holidays.  Next Christmas Eve, he shares his idea with Ted and Danny, both of whom are less than impressed.    On Christmas Day Linda Mason (Marjorie Reynolds), a young show business hopeful working in a florist shop turns up at \\"Holiday Inn\\" looking for employment, sent there by Danny to get her off his back.   Jim and she click, and together they work to have \\"Holiday Inn\\" open that New Years Eve.  They both perform at the inn that evening, which looks to be a success, and also begin to fall in love.   But there's trouble ahead, Lila has abandoned Ted and the act that very same evening to elope with a millionaire.   Ted gets blinding drunk and shows up at the inn.   On the crowded dance floor Ted bumps into Linda, grabs her and starts to dance, she keeps up with him perfectly; they make a marvelous team.  At the end Ted passes out, and Jim has him taken up to one of the bedrooms to sleep it off.   The crowd applauds enthusiastically, Danny arrives and hears the cheering and learns Ted was dancing with a new partner whom he glimpses from the back ascending the staircase after the comatose Ted.   The next day a hung over Ted and Danny peremptorily decide that this mystery woman will replace Lila in the act, and plan as to how to find her.    Jim, burned once before, is determined that this won't happen, and has a trick or two of his own up his sleeve to keep Linda out of their clutches.      There is a cornucopia of songs from the Irving Berlin songbook that are both sung and danced expertly by Crosby, Astaire, Reynolds and Dale used primarily to highlight the various holidays.   My own favorites are the three that have stood the test of time to become classics.  \\"Happy Holidays\\" merrily sung by Jim and Linda at the New Year's Eve inauguration of \\"Holiday Inn\\" begins with an outdoor panoramic view of the crowded, brightly lit inn then the camera pans in through the wide windows.   The nattily dressed Jim and Linda drive back to the inn from church in a horse drawn carriage while Jim sings \\"Easter Parade\\" to the Easter bonneted Linda.   The best is \\"White Christmas\\" which is staged simply and beautifully.   Jim and Linda are in the darkened living room lit only by the roaring fire and the candlelit Christmas tree, they've only just met, and both are alone on Christmas evening without family or friends.  The dialogue leading into the song evokes feelings of nostalgia overlaid with a poignancy tinged with a gentle melancholy.    As Jim sings and plays the piano and Linda chimes in, you see the mood lift as the song works it's spell and the romance start to bloom between them.   As the their final harmony fades at the conclusion of the song, they beam at one another as the fire flares up in the fireplace throwing a bright glow on their faces, a magic moment.       On the flip side there is \\"Abraham\\", a number that now is considered in bad taste, where on Lincoln's Birthday, Jim and Linda perform the song in blackface as a minstrel number.   Although, it's embarrassing to watch now, I fast-forward through it myself, and some television stations will edit it out, no racial slur was intended.  It's a plot device that Jim devises at the last minute to disguise Linda from the prowling Ted and Danny.   It also must be remembered that the movie is a product of its time, and today's enlightened standards were not in existence.    Crosby's and Astaire's star wattage and on screen rapport along with Berlin's songs of course made the film a big hit. Of the two Crosby has the edge, Jim Hardy is a more sympathetic part, the songs outshine the dances, Bing has the lion's share of those, and he's also the better actor.  Also, Astaire's character is too selfish and absorbed in himself to be likeable, Jim is his alleged \\"best friend\\" yet Ted woos Lila away from him without a qualm, and is fully prepared to do the same with Linda.   While the dances are good per se, Astaire only has one memorable, innovative number a Fourth of July solo danced with exploding firecrackers at his feet.      Future Broadway superstar Mary Martin was originally to play Linda, but was pregnant.  A pity the film wasn't made earlier or later, she and Crosby paired wonderfully together in two prior films, and it would have been even more memorable to have Bing and she introduce \\"White Christmas\\" together.   That being said Marjorie Reynolds does a very competent job particularly in the dances and is likeable but lacks that little something extra, ditto Virginia Dale as the flighty Lila.   In lesser roles Walter Abel brings the right level of smarminess to agent Danny Reed, and Louise Beavers is warm and down to earth as Jim's housekeeper Mamie.     I have to say a quick word about the set of the actual \\"Holiday Inn\\" by the art directors Roland Anderson and Hans Drier, it's perfection.  It's a long sprawling reprodcution of a colonial farmhouse, classically decorated, very similar to the one used in \\"Christmas in Connecticut\\".  I would love to live in either one of them!    \\"Holiday Inn\\" was such a big hit, that in 1954 it was very, very loosely remade in color and Vistavision this time around, entitled \\"Irving Berlin's White Christmas\\", although it is more familiarly known as just \\"White Christmas\\".  Bing was on board again, and although Fred was courted, he wasn't interested.  Danny Kaye who replaced him was an inspired choice, as were singer Rosemary Clooney and dancer Vera Ellen as Bing and Danny's romantic interests.  As to which is the better of the two, is perhaps too close to call. Both have their individual strengths and weaknesses, but each in it's own way is superior entertainment.  I recommend you try them both and decide for yourself!
B000FP2OPY|4.0|First of all, I only started watching this show in January of 2011, meaning the 6th season is currently airing and I have much to catch up on. I am halfway through season 2 right now, and for the most part really like it alot!<br /><br />Since this is a review of Season One, I will comment about that.<br /><br />The premise is interesting; two brothers, Sam and Dean, trained by their Father in hunting evil are searching for their missing Father who went missing during a \\"hunt\\", while handling evil shenanigans along the way. The characters are very likable...I especially like Dean because his sense of humor and behavior at times mirror my own. The brothers use various fake police/federal IDs to help them gather information about victims and such from local residents and authorities. Each episode is basically \\"urban legand of the week\\" but I feel it is done in ways that have not already been done to death. It's not until the last handful of episodes of the season that the true main storyline begins to be revealed...and it's an interesting one, in my opinion.<br /><br />Though some reviewers on here have said they find the acting wooden, and that Dean's behavior makes them question why anyone would believe he was a police officer/marshall/FBI Agent, etc, I have to disagree with these reviewers. I like the acting just fine; it's not over the top nor understanded, and they seem to actually feel the emotions they're expressing. And as for the believability of anyone buying that they are with the police/marshall/FBI, etc, I wonder if these reviewers are even watching the show, because many times they have gotten caught having lied about their credentials. Besides, most times the episodes take place in small towns, not big cities, so it's logical to assume that the townfolks and local authorities haven't had enough interactions with these branches of authorities to easily spot when someone's real or not.<br /><br />As for the quality of the stories themselves, they feel like nice mini-horror movies to me. And it's especially refreshing that the brothers are at times wrong or screw up, instead of being unrealistically spot-on all the time.<br />The writing itself is nicely done, in my opinion, though a couple of times they tried to pull a fast one. For example.....<br /><br />{{{{SPOILER ALERT}}}}<br />Near the end of \\"Bugs\\" Sam and Dean learn what's going on and rush to the home of the developer who unknowingly built homes on cursed land. According to the story, this is the last night of the curse, which ends at 6am. Sam and Dean arrived at the developer's home around midnight...yet despite the fact that bugs arrived at the home moments after Sam and Dean got there, only about 5 minutes or so passed until it was suddenly 6am and the bugs left. That's cheating, no matter how you try to explain it away.<br />{{{{END OF SPOILER}}}}<br /><br />Since I believe that the music in a series adds emotion and sometimes power to a scene, the selection of classic rock songs is well placed! Amazingly, ALL THE MUSIC from the aired episodes are in these DVD episodes. That's incredible, considering how common it is for companies to replace the music with cheaper crap when releasing a series on DVD. So if you're a fan of classic rock, you'll get to enjoy the original tunes by the original artists!<br /><br />I was surprised how visually graphic they were on this show at times. I mean that in a \\"WOAH! COOL!\\" sort of way, I assure you. It just impressed me that for a network series they were allowed to show things I'd only expect to find on cable or an R-rated movie. Oh, and there's strong language at times...strong for a CW series, anyway. It's nothing that's done in every episode, it happens here and there.<br /><br />My only real gripe (other than my \\"Bugs\\" one) is that a few times things got predictable. Not in a \\"eh, seen that done already\\" but in a \\"I suspected things long before it was confirmed.\\" It was not bad enough to turn me off from the series, obviously, however it did kind of take away from the enjoyment of the episodes where it happened. I'm an analytical person though, so perhaps it was just me.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Buffy, X-Files, Kolchek: The Night Stalker (original, not that crap they did a few years ago), or Friday The 13th: The Series, you'll probably like this show.<br />If however, you're looking for \\"Dawson's Creek with monsters\\" pass on this...very little warm fuzzy moments on here.episodes where it happened. I'm an analytical person though, so perhaps it was just me.    If you're a fan of Buffy, X-Files, Kolchek: The Night Stalker (original, not that crap they did a few years ago), or Friday The 13th: The Series, you'll probably like this show.

B0001XAOLQ|5.0|I BOUGHT THIS MOVIE FOR RESEARCH. I HAD WATCHED IT YEARS AGO.  THIS IS A TIMELESS MOVIE THAT IS SHOWN FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF GERMANS DURING WWII. WHAT IS AMAZING FROM MY AMERICAN VIEWPOINT IS HOW THE VIEWER IDENTIFIES WITH THE INDIVIDUAL GERMAN SAILORS IN \\"DAS BOOT\\" (the boat,)  WE FEAR FOR THEM AS WE LEARN HEIR BACKGROUND, FAMILIES, HOPES. WE SEE HOW HITLER TOTALLY DECEIVED HIS OWN PEOPLE AND PUT THEM INTO HOPELESS SITUATIONS.     MY OWN MOTHER WAS IN A MERCHANT SHIP THAT WAS TORPEDOED, SO I WAS IN AN SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEAD AS I WATCHED THIS.       EVEN THOUGH I KNEW THE ENDING AND WAS PREPARED FOR IT, I WAS SURPRISED BY MY OWN REACTION AT THE END -- .  I WON'T BE A SPOILER, BUT IT WAS QUITE AN EXPERIENCE TO RELIVE THIS PERIOD IN TIME -- FROM ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW.    THANK GOD THE WORLD SURVIVED ALL THAT HORROR THAT HAPPENED NO SO LONG AGO.

B000N4SHPS|4.0|I watched this on TV the other night, and now I want to purchase it so I can watch it without a million commercial interruptions.   I think Milo Ventimiglia did a good job playing Rocky Jr; it's believable that he would be somewhat resentful of his Dad because he feels if he achieves anything, it's because his last name is Balboa and not because he did anything to earn his place in the world. Rocky sets him straight on that in the most stern yet loving way, and father and son are reunited.  At first I feared there was going to be a romance between Rocky and Little Marie, but two things happened that told me it wasn't going to happen, at least in this film: Rocky comes right out and tells Marie \\"She's gone, but she's not gone, you know?\\" speaking of Adrian. And when Marie comes to his hotel room before the fight, it's to give him a picture of Adrian to inspire him. She wouldn't bring a picture of the dead wife if she was hoping for anything else to happen. And I agree with a couple other reviewers: the best part was the end, when Rocky gathers his family around him before the score is read and says \\"Let's go\\". He doesn't care if he won or lost. He proved something to himself,and he's finally able to let go.   Very, very well done. Yo Adrian, he did it.

0312330537|4.0|When I finished reading this 900-odd page book, I thought, 'Wow! what a life of splendid adventure, love, friendship and crime in a foreign land!'. It was real five-star material and I would have given it five stars. But then, subsequent investigation showed me that the book is actually only a novel based on real-life events in the life of the author Gregory David Roberts (GDR). That dampened my enthusiasm a bit because the book is written in first person and all through it sounds so authentic and true that one is left in sheer admiration at the life of GDR in Bombay in the 1980s. Once I knew that it is a novel, I was left wondering which parts are fiction and which ones are facts.<br />The author, an Australian,  has a charmed existence in Bombay, arriving there after escaping from a maximum security prison in Melbourne, Australia, and reaching Bombay in 1982 with a false New Zealand passport. In Bombay, he slips into the backpackers' haunt around the Gateway of India, Leopold's cafe, Taj Mahal Hotel and the Colaba Causeway. He is adopted as a friend by Prabhaker, a delightful slum-dwelling taxi driver who gives him the name Linbaba - Lin for short (from his false passport name of Lindsay). From then on, Lin goes on a roller coaster life over the next few years, living in a slum with Prabhaker and helping the honest, hard-working slum-dwellers as a substitute doctor and fully integrating himself there. Lin spends six months in Sunder, Prabhaker's village, and learns the local language Marathi in addition to Hindi. The villagers love him and Prabhaker's mother gives him the Indian name - Shantaram which means 'man of peace'.<br />Shantaram returns to Bombay, falls in love with the beautiful Karla Saarnen, an American girl in Bombay and eventually meets up with one of the mafia dons, Abdul Khader. Khaderbhai, as he is called, likes him and brings him in fully into his 'business' of passport smuggling, illegal currency trading, even gun-running in the cause of the Afghan war. He even poses as an American diplomat and rescues a lovely blonde American girl, Lisa Carter, from the brothel of Madame Zhou. This results in him getting imprisoned in the notorious Arthur Road prison in Bombay. Shantaram even dabbles in Bollywood, goes to fight eventually in Afghanistan along with the Mujahids and returns alive back in Bombay.<br />It is exciting stuff all through and the book ends with his father figure of the mafia, Abdel Khader dying in Afghanistan and the next generation of the mafia council taking over the operations in their region of Bombay. Finally, the author gets caught in Germany in 1990 on one of his mafia 'jobs', gets extradited to Australia to serve out the rest of his prison term where he writes two drafts of the voluminous book only to be torn down by the cruel warders.<br />Shantaram writes about brutal torture in the Australian prison system, which came as a surprise to me, having lived in that beautiful country all through the 1980s. Shantaram also has immense love for Bombay and its people, in fact for Indians in general. It is obvious from his writing that he is very much at home in Bombay and was fully integrated with the lives of its people in spite of being a white man. His book shows how the Bombay mafia, for all its crimes, is very considerate towards the poor and also very secular and inclusive in spite of the fact that many of them happen to be from one community - Muslims. I was intrigued by one of their products which is called 'the poverty passport'! The mafia makes a false passport on credit for poor villagers whereby the village sends one young man under this passport to the Gulf countries so that he can work hard, make money, pay off the passport cost and then save enough for making a second passport so that another compatriot from the village can get his 'povert passport' so that he can lift more people out of poverty in their village! Another thing that is obvious from the book is that the police and the politicians are routinely cruel and exploitative towards the poor whereas the mafia is not.<br />I used to live in Bombay very close to the Gateway of India in the 1970s and it was a revelation to me that so much drug trafficking and crime was going on in the seemingly peaceful and colorful backpackers' haunt across from the hostel where I was living. Shantaram was living a life of crime in Bombay even though he does not commit any murders. However, one is left only with admiration and love for him rather than feel critical of him for being a criminal who tries to justify himself through his compassion for Bombay's poor.<br />The book is long but it grabs you all the way. It has an electrifying start and you are hooked and simply can't do much else till you finish it.are routinely cruel and exploitative towards the poor whereas the mafia is not.

0061245097|2.0|So the first book was ok, even had some neat concepts and characters emerge. They never were fully developed, so i assumed they might be in the second but No...still very flat and silly really. Bones while sexy yes, is so trite asnd cliched, with his \\"Wanker\\" and \\"sod all\\" and \\"bloody this bloody that\\" Real Brits do not speak this way...never have. I still couldnt figure out why this character was in love with Cat to the crazy degree he is...? and the same for her!! I think this book was mysoginistic, and sexist to the point of laughing out loud at many parts.  So...i never thought i would raise my IQ by reading this...and have enjoyed some other urban fantasy romance..but this second book, and the third by the way, were absurd. Just more of the same, page after page after page after page.... As if a Government agency that is state-of-the art and obvioulsy costs millions to fund, would work primarily to protect one agent...the author should have thrown in some other (world saving maybe) motivations beside saving Cat's as$ over and over again.  All men want her, most love her, all women hate her, or are jealous of her...she cant loose in a fight,though she has been at it only 4-5 years...against 100+ year old vampires?  I think the  author was lazy...she could have actually ahd something here...character development..world building...some pacing, and timing. A little break in the butt kicking by something other than mind blowing sex.  And that...i was not disgusted or shocked, but it did get boring...doesn't poor Bones get a little effort shown toward him, or is he the only active particpant..every time..gees allot for work for the old guy.  No sexual tension..no building up, denying what they want etc...I guess i have to say i tried..but just not my thing i guess.  I think the Darkfever series was much much better. Anmd wioth that, back to literate, novels that make you think, feel, laugh (with not at), cry, pnder, learn...this was garbage

0765322889|5.0|First, let me say, this book and series is a complex piece of literature. The world which Erikson places the reader in is quite developed and has an extensive history which is important (as it is often referenced). There are often multiple story lines to follow as well as a dozen or so characters, too. So if you are looking for an easy read requiring little attention, you might pass on this book.<br /><br />However, if you are interested in an engaging story with often a series of stories slowly intertwining into an all encompassing convergence then you are looking at the right book. This series has many stories to tell, and sometimes from multiple perspectives and often not along the same timeline. At one point you will read about an event and then a few pages later, chapter later, even a book later, the same story will be told from a different perspective. This is something I love about the books, they make you think. The story is rarely laid out for you to see. Erikson gives you the puzzle pieces but you have to assemble the story; at least to fully understand it.<br /><br />The characters are shockingly real and are not at all a typical hero-character; no one is impervious to Erikson. They have a depth to them that makes you feel like there are many things you'll never know about them despite being privy to private lives or secret thoughts.<br /><br />I have religiously read this series more than once and each time have found parts of the story that I didn't notice before; often because the relevant event they pertained to wasn't explained at the time or hadn't even occurred. That is another fascinating trait of Erikson's writing is that he will foreshadow to a significant event with perhaps only a passing statement or silent thought.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book as well as the other 8 that are out to all who want to follow a rigorous plot and mysterious characters.<br /><br />Power draws Power.

The filmmakers did a good job adapting a very complex battle to a manageable screenplay. I was a bit disappointed that no mention was made of the fight at LZ Albany instead focusing exclusively on LZ X-Ray, but I understand why they did it. I'm sure it was necessary to make it easier to follow on film.<br /><br />The actors were selected well for the characters. The film work was outstanding. The scenes are confusing where they should be confusing and easy to follow when they should be easy. I loved the way they flashed back and forth between the battle and the wives at home. That was done very different from the book, but it worked well for the screenplay. It was an important part of the story, and the filmmakers managed to convey the extreme emotion. This film is nearly non-stop action after the opening sequence to get to Vietnam. It was important to have a break from the shooting.<br /><br />All in all, I think this was a very important film. It was true. If anything, the filmmakers underplayed just how savage the battle was.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Dr. Quinn was one of my favorites on TV during it's era. These videos are just like watching the real show with no commercials. I had been wanting this for a long time and finally found it at Amazon for a great price.
B0016K40KY|5.0|I actually own Lawrence of Arabia on VHS. It's a two tape set. I prefer the two tape set because the original movie was done with an intermission. I haven't seen the one disc version, but I hope it includes the intermission. The first half of the movie is drastically different from the second half. I've watched the first half maybe five times. I normally only watch the second half. I've seen that at least a hundred times.<br /><br />This movie is great in every aspect. The actual, historical story is incredible. T. E. Lawrence was a prominent figure with a magnetic personality. Although this movie isn't exactly historically accurate, enough of it is based on real events that the writers didn't have to embellish a whole lot. Lawrence was interesting enough as it was. O'Toole looks much like the historical Lawrence. I love the way they depict his personality changes after being captured by the Turks. When he finally accepts that he is \\"extraordinary\\", the movie goes into warp drive. It's great!<br /><br />The cinematography is unbelievable. The panoramas of the desert are great. Having been made in the days when extras were actual people, it's incredible to see the huge numbers of people during some of the scenes. I can't imagine what it cost. The dialogue is great. This movie is filled with wonderful lines.<br /><br />It won a lot of awards, so it's no secret that this is a great movie. I recommend it to anyone that hasn't seen it. I think nearly anyone can find something to like in this movie. I plan on buying the DVD when my tapes wear out.

6305603847|5.0|Pink Floyd \\"The Wall\\" is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's simply life changing. The way the lyrics are nearly all of the dialogue was something that has never been done so skillfully before or since. Geldof who was a little known punk artist at the time is perfect for the part of Pink. The way the movie depicts his childhood and his descent into madness and finally his transformation into a fascist like the ones who killed his father is just brilliant. Some of the scenes are blood curdling. The transition in the middle of the movie with \\"One of My Turns\\" is the best part of the entire movie for me.<br /><br />The movie includes songs that aren't on the original albums, and some of the lyrics are different. Geldof does his own singing in the movie, and I think it was a good idea. He brings an attitude that wouldn't have been nearly as effective if Waters or Gilmore had done the singing. Lip syncing just would not work on those scenes. Some people may not be aware of it, but part of the movie is autobiographical for Roger and many of the crazy scenes are based on things that happened with Syd before he cracked up. Even the melting face is based on an incident where Syd put a bunch of Bryl Creme and Mandrax (quaaludes) on his head before going on stage. It looked like his face was melting when he got under the lights. That's what Roger said it was based on.<br /><br />The plot has been re-hashed so many times that it's probably useless to do it again here. I'll simply say that if you haven't seen \\"The Wall\\", you should. It's not for everyone. I used to have a genuine movie marquis poster over my bed. My wife made me take it down when we were dating because it \\"freaked her out\\". It does freak some people out. You either get it or you don't. If you get it, \\"The Wall\\" is a must own movie.
1608191664|5.0|Ha-Joon Chang's latest offering sets out a broad ranging critique of neo-liberal economics distilled down to twenty three points . For readers, who have read \\"Kicking Away the Ladder\\" and \\"Bad Samaritans\\", many of the arguments made will be familiar and cover points that the author has previously made. This book is a succinct summary of those arguments - with more.  Although without the more detailed material in his earlier writings, the author makes a number of hard hitting arguments that represent a full frontal assault on neo-liberal economics.    Each of the 23 sections is titled with a statement represting the particular proposition that the author argues and is self explanatory. The main themes however are as follows.    First of all, the author advocates a judicious mix of state intervention and market forces as the best way to run the economy.  He points out that countries that have followed neo-liberal formulas have done worse than how they performed when they went with a more regulated and state driven model. He provides data from Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa to back up the argument. He notes that the two major economies that continue to produce high growth China and India have both refused to follow full blooded neo-liberalism and stuck with the older dispensation of mixing market forces with a high level of state regulation and state enterprise. Chang's support of State action includes advocacy of affirmative action the welfare state. The welfare state he argues gives workers a safety net so that they are prepared to take chances and work in risky and new industries some of which will be winners. He argues that where there is no safety net, workers will gravitate towards safer options (and fewer) since holding down a job is the only guarantee of making ends meet. The result he says is less growth than in countries where workers are able to be more adventurous. For example, the US has does less well than Finland and Sweden which by providing safety nets, allows workers to take risks and experiment in new areas of economic activity. Chang makes a specific point that for developing countries, the need for \\"planning space\\" for the State is particularly important referring to the historical examples of the United States' path from underdevelopment to development and that of his own native South Korea relying on high degrees of state activism and protection of infant industries until they could compete without assistance.     The author secondly debunks the so-called knowledge economy and asserts the importance of manufacturing without which no real economy can exist. He also observes that the introduction of labour saving devices such as the washing machine last century were far more important that the internet in bringing change and advancing economies and societies - despite the hype that surrounds the \\"knowledge economy\\". He expresses  alarm that manufacturing companies like GM and GE now earn greater profits from their finance operations than from their core manufacturing activities.     Chang attacks the concept of shareholder value which gives priority to maximizing returns to the shareholder at the expense of the longer term interests of the company and its employees - and its long term strategic value to society. He points out the shareholders are often short term investors and speculators who seek a short term gain rather than long term earning of wealth through their shareholdings. He says that running \\"companies in the interests of floating shareholders is not only inequitable but also inefficient, not just for the national economy but also for the company itself. As Jack Welch recently confessed, shareholder value is probably the `dumbest idea in the world'.      The chapter \\"Assume the worst about people and you get the worst\\" covers how people behave as actors in the economy. The textbooks talk of rational actors in the market working to maximize their self interest. This in the author's view is not always consistent with the reality of the workplace. Decisions are not always made to fit this prescription - by employers or employees. I run part of a (modest)enterprise and the authors observations ring true. Most employers understand that merely paying people well is not enough. Other things come into play such as pride in good work and recognition of effort by the enterprise through non-monetary rewards. Sometimes, one sees behaviors that do not always maximize the personal gain of the actor in the manner required by theory but are motivated by the best interest of the enterprise as a whole. The author cites examples of these kinds of behaviors eg of Japanese industrial workers making suggestions on how things could work better - and being taken seriously by management. This may still be a kind of enlightened self interest but is at odds with the usual behaviors that the theory appears to assume.    The most convincing arguments on economic matters are usually those that are based not on abstract theory and making assumptions about human behavior but on those based on real life historical experience. Few economic theorists predicted the financial crisis of 2007 - with some exceptions such as George Soros. However, economic historians gave plenty of warnings eg the writings of Andre Frank and Giovanni Arrighi. One of the great strengths of the author is his frequent recourse to economic history rather than theory to make his points. For example, his survey of how rich countries got rich examines the role of state regulation and protection of infant industries until that protection can be taken away and mature industries can compete in a free market. He explores the evolution of the US economy following this route from its beginnings as a highly protected economy to a free market economy when US companies were able to compete after a long period of protection.  Chang in his reliance on hard historical experience rather than abstract theorizing helps fortify theconclusion that economic history rather than economic theory might hold a safer guide to understanding things.     A couple of years ago I remember discussing the financial crisis with a bright young economist and financial planner and was horrified to learn that his modeling which produced \\"blue skies\\" predictions for his clients (before the crisis) was based on just seven years of data - not even counting the recession of the early 90s. Had he had training in economic history, perhaps there is a small possibility that his predications may have been different and saved his clients some of the money they lost.    I have some minor quibbles. In covering such a large ground against the broad sweep of history, Chang can at times make some statements that are susceptible to challenge. For example, he asserts that the USSR could not have won the Second World War without US armaments. Historians of the Second World War could question this. Chang also makes the statement that Indian planning \\"failed\\". There is however a very credible alternative view that planning (supported by Indian business in the 50s and 60s) worked to protect Indian business by supplying it with subsided goods from the planned State sector during the early stages of India's modernization and that liberalization came later only when Indian business were strong enough to compete withput State subsidies. This analysis accords with Chang's own arguments in favour of protecting infant industry. However, these (and other) minor quibbles do not derogate from the overall cogency of Chang's arguments.    The authors assault of neo-liberal \\"orthodoxy\\" though powerful and convincing may be as one review puts it amount to \\"bayoneting\\" a dead man. Much of what was \\"orthodoxy\\" may no longer be so in light of the recourse by governments throughout the world including in the US and UK to older Keynesian formulas.  The author therefore may be reflecting what is fast becoming a more mainstream view than advocating a truly contrarian position.   Surprisingly (or maybe not surprisingly) there appears to be little accessible counterargument by neo-liberal economists. It would have to be a brave neo-liberal though who would poke their head over the parapet just at the present time. The limited criticisms leveled at the author by the neo-liberal William Easterly addressed some of the points made by Chang but his counter-attack is weak and not convincing. Not a surprise. The stronger criticism comes from the left. Not disagreeing with Chang's specific points, he is however taken to task for not following through the implications of his conclusions. Is capitalism itself viable they ask?     Chang's answer is \\"Yes\\". Capitalism though not perfect, is the best available alternative - if managed properly. This seems to mean a free market combined with a high degree of State involvement and regulation. Is Chang right? As the aftermath of the financial crisis unfolds, Keynes makes a sudden return and China and India push on to produce high growth using their own models for a \\"mixed economy\\". The answer does indeed appear to be a tentative \\"yes\\".   However, the answer must be tentative - as the debate is never closed and needs to be constantly revisited in the light of real life experience as it unfolds.

1439107955|3.0|If you're at all interested in the scientific process, this is a worthwhile read. It teaches you a lot about how discoveries are made and gives a realistic portrait of the various forces and actors that produce scientific knowledge; the empirical and the political. It explores the hubris and radical disregard for patient well-being that some physicians harbor, as well as the continuing effort to bridge the gap between clinicians and the humans they work with.     HOWEVER, the book is terribly written. I can't get over the reviews that keep lauding the writing style. Mukherjee has a lexicon of maybe 12 words that he cycles throughout the book. Mercurial, recapitulate, friable. The word recapitulate is used no less than 100 times, it's on virtually every page (i wanna find a text searchable version so i can get the exact count, it's definitely up there). Further, he constantly tries to wax poetic with these really horrible metaphors and similes that fall on their face every time. The book reads a lot like a wired article, but sprinkled in all over the place are these attempts to pull out these brittle abstractions and profundities that are just not there, it quickly gets very annoying.    If you're interested in cancer, or the pursuit of medicine, it's a decent portrait of the field and the current understanding. Just don't pretend it's well crafted.
0156027321|5.0|Have you ever read a book about a kid that is stuck on a life boat with a tiger named Richard Parker? If not then this might be the next book you read.    Pi Patel lives in India with his brother, mother, and his father. His father owns a zoo but they want to go to Canada after they sell their animals they get on the Tsimtsum. But in the Pacific the Tsimtsum sinks and pi is put on a life boat with a hyena, orangutan, a zebra that has a broken leg, and a 450 pound tiger. But soon all that's left is the tiger and Pi. But soon they run out of food and they lose strength and Pi is a vegetarian but has to eat fish. Richard Parker has the same problem his fur becomes dull and he becomes lazy.   When they to land Richard Parker runs off and Pi says, \\"Richard Parker it's over. We survived. I owe you more gratitude than I can express.\\"  Pi has to talk about how the ship sunk but nobody believes him because of the animals.   I recommend this book to people that can wait for the action to start about half way through it. I think the main message the author was saying was to not give up on hope and you will survive through anything.   Nathan Palmer 7th grade

0525951652|1.0|While this book is hyped as a work of greatness, it is in fact a mediocre effort at best. First, Follett insists on inserting extremely detailed accounts of sexual encounters throughout the book, as is his habit. These descriptions are much like those playground discussions held by juveniles in tight, tittering circles. Totally out of place in a book that is supposed to be a serious work. Portions of the book, especially dealing with the Russian revolution, where so laborious and boring that I found myself skipping not just paragraphs but actual pages of text. As one commenter stated, the inter-relationships of the book's characters is so far from plausibility that it is comical - no where near the similar type of character interactions created by authors such as Michener or Clavell. I read the Fall Of Giants from cover to cover, in hope of finding some redeeming quality in the book but alas found none. If this is the first part of a trilogy, I am afraid that I will NOT be reading the second and third works. I suggest you spend your money on something else.

B00371QQ0M|1.0|I watched the bluray Dune a few days after I read the book. I can say that the movie is terrible by comparison.   As others have said, it seems that they tried to stuff too much into this film without actually going into any details. Most characters seem completely misrepresented in my opinion for what little you are able to see of individual characters, and there is not explanation of the background or process of events. For example, in one scene Paul decides that he must ride a worm, then in the following scene, he does it right away without any indication of being trained or any time passing. This story should not be told in a 2 hour movie. It is impossible to understand what is going on and why unless you have the time to explain and develop ideas. If you enjoyed the book, do yourself a favor and pass this movie up.
B003Q6D25K|4.0|Let me start by saying that I enjoyed the original Paranormal Activity (PA1) and I enjoyed this film as well.  If you didn't like the first film, I'm not sure why you would like this film, but conversely, if you enjoyed the original, you'll probably enjoy this one as well.  I don't think Paranormal Activity 2 (PA2) is as good as PA1.  I would give the first film five stars while this one only four simply because I don't think PA2 is as frightening as the first film.  The end of PA2 doesn't have the impact of PA1's ending.  There is one place in PA2 where you will probably jump, but it's a startle, not a scare.  A good one, though, nonetheless.  PA2 basically treads the same ground as PA1.  This makes it unoriginal, but it's also helps to make it an effective prequel/sequel.    PA2 is both a prequel and short sequel to PA1.  PA2 starts well before the events of PA1 and ends shortly after PA1 ends.  Without giving away any spoilers, the majority of PA2 is the story of why the events in PA1 happened and then, for a few minutes at the end, PA2 shows how the events of PA1 impacted the characters in PA2.  All in all, for me, PA2 was an effective explanation and short continuation of the original film.    The DVD includes two versions of the film, theactrical and unrated. The DVD is light on extras - just a few deleted scenes that weren't very interesting to me and some trailers.    If you liked the original film, this one will probably be your cup of tea.  If not, rent before you buy.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Supernatural is far and away the best show on television, and it has been since its inception in 2005.  The awesome acting (by the superb Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki -- later joined brilliantly by Jim Beaver and Misha Collins) is, simply, out of this world (no cliche intended)!  Put these wonderful actors together with great production values, writing that is some of the best ever done for television, directorial brilliance every week, and the viewer experiences totally absorbing wonder, chills, and delight.    Season 6 is everything I had hoped it would be, and if you haven't seen Dean vs. vampires and Tinkerbelles, Sam go darkside big time, Bobby handle a wood chipper, and Castiel learn the secrets of a pizza delivery man, then you are REALLY missing out!      I own every season on an Amazon-purchased DVD; they are the best, and I look forward to getting mine every year, including Season 6, which I just ordered, thank you!  Long Live Supernatural, and may the gods of Warner Brothers and The CW give us a Season 7, please!

0375846735|4.0|I'd have to give this third and final book in the Dark Materials Trilogy 3.5 stars.  It wasn't nearly as good as the first, or even the second, yet despite that it did provide an ending for this very interesting fantasy series.  This book should not be read as a standalone, but rather a reader should read the books in order starting with the first.  For those not familiar with the series (and a possible spoiler) Lyra is a little girl who sets off on a quest to rescue her friend along with her daemon Pantalaimon and a mysterious alethiometer which always tells the truth.  When her father opens a portal between worlds she goes through and meets a new friend in Will, who is the wielder of the subtle knife that can cut doorways between worlds.  There is a war breaking out between rebels and the Authority and both children have to try to find out what is the best way for them to help but trouble comes when Lyra is kidnapped by her mother.<br /><br />Now in this book, Will has set out to rescue Lyra and continue on in their quest.  He is able to do so with the help of two rebel angels and a few small people from a different world.  However, once they are together again they brave an even greater danger by journeying to the land of the dead.  They hope to talk with some of their loved ones there for insight but it'll take more bravery and sacrifice then they can imagine.  And while they're doing so the war is about to come to a head between Lyra's father and the leader of the Authority's troops, Metatron.<br /><br />The characters were very very rushed in this novel.  All of them change quite a bit (especially Lyra and Will) but it is done so quickly that it doesn't seem genuine.  Even strong motivations are changed in the time it takes to blink and I felt myself re-reading a couple times to see if I had missed something.  The book itself was also written very choppy and rushed and while I enjoyed the scenes with Mary the scientist on a different world, they only served to chop up the book even more.  There is some controversy in this book and some of a religious nature could be offended by some of the content that Pullman has put down in this book.  However one can make a choice to take the book seriously, or enjoy it as a fantasy read.  And in my opinion I do think this is a series worth reading precisely because of the thoughts it provokes.<br /><br />While this book wasn't the best of the series it did serve to act as closure on the series itself so I can't be too sorry I read it.  I only wish Pullman would have wrote another book or left some of the ideas out to better serve the time line of this novel and keep it understandable.<br /><br />The Amber Spyglass<br />Copyright 2000<br />465 pages<br /><br />Review by M.

B000FC2PKG|5.0|This book is like the worst train wreck imaginable:  bloody, icky, horrific, scandalous, and fraught with misplaced lust and desire.  Yet, like a train wreck, you just can't look away.  Nope, I couldn't put it down no matter how twisted the plot got.  Several people have already commented/summarized the plot--so no need to go there.  I just wanted to comment because many people disliked the book because the characters where \\"unlikeable.\\"  I think they got it wrong.  I wholeheartedly disagree. I don't think Catherine was meant to be the likeable \\"heroine\\" of the story.  I think in her, Gardner embodied the perfect femme fatale (a horror show somewhat reminiscent of of Stone's character in Basic Instinct).  Bobby on the other hand, I was routing for him the whole time, hoping he'd come out on the other side a better person.  I liked Bobby and the ending of this book left me wanting more of him.  I cannot wait to read Hide!

0547258305|3.0|I enjoyed the premise of this book very much. Katsa (reminiscent of Katniss?) is endowed with a Grace, or special power. In this world, being a Graceling is evidenced by having each eye a different color, in Katsa's case one eye is blue and the other is green. No one's grace is exactly the same and some are more valuable than others. Katsa's grace seems to be fighting (some say killing). She is virtually undefeatable and, therefore, of great use to the King who uses her for his own special \\"projects\\" (such as torturing a killing his enemies). Katsa is not happy being a tool for the king and tries to control part of her own destiny by creating a secret organization called the Council who, unbeknownst to the King, travels the different kingdoms doing good and righting wrongs. It is on one of these quests that Katsa encounters the mysterious Po, another Graceling who is unlike anyone she's ever met before. The main part of the story takes off from there when Katsa and Po embark on their own quest, searching for answers to a mystery. My one major criticism of the book, and the reason that I only gave it 3 1/2 stars, is that when they finally find the answers they seek, my reaction was, \\"Huh? that's it?\\" After taking the time to weave a somewhat intricate storyline, the main motivation for the antagonist is unclear at worst and simplistic at best.  Ending was anticlimactic. Overall a good read, though.

B0049GYXDG|5.0|\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is one of my favorite books. I enjoy watching version after version, each taking a shot at making Lewis Carroll's dreamlike, episodic prose and poetry into a film or TV production that is cohesive and at the same time, worthy of the fantastic images we all have in our minds as we read.<br /><br />Unless the story is changed markedly--as Tim Burton did with his 2010 version, the only big screen \\"Alice\\" that was a box office smash--many have tried with varying results. Walt Disney's 1951 version, which is presented for the first time on a \\"60th Anniversary\\" Blu-Ray combo package in this edition also including a not-quite-so-decked-out-with-bonus-materials DVD.<br /><br />The \\"Alice\\" material was clearly close to Walt Disney since he did his own twist on the idea in his first successful film series, the Alice comedies, in which a live action Virginia Davis interacted with animated creatures. \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" was also almost the first Disney animated feature until \\"Snow White\\" was ultimately selected. Mary Pickford was to play a live Alice for Disney, along with Ginger Rogers--and even Margaret O'Brien, whose mother turned it down because of the price offered (a fact she recently told talk show host Stu Shostak on a recent shokusradio.com broadcast).<br /><br />By the time \\"Alice\\" was underway as an all-animated feature, the studio was still hurting from WWII losses, the 1950 release \\"Cinderella\\" had helped things considerably and high hopes were dashed when \\"Alice\\" initially underperformed at the box office.<br /><br />The musical score lived on through the decades, even though the film was out of general release for 23 years and shown twice in edited form on TV. The ultimate public embrace of Disney's \\"Alice\\" came over the last few decades as it became a staple of home video and cable TV. Now, as Alice voice Kathryn Beaumont states quite truthfully in the new bonus documentary, it is absolutely now one of the most popular and beloved Disney animated features.<br /><br />The very things that were problematic for \\"Alice\\" as a '50s movie have become assets in modern times. The choppy, episodic nature makes it ideal for television and video. It's loose, zany, irreverent style is welcome to kids brought up on Spongebob and Bullwinkle. The voice cast, once almost completely well-known to the world at large, now fits the characters better than ever--and have become iconic on their own. And perhaps above all, the look of the film is a monument to the legendary Disney art director Mary Blair. See the recent New York Times review for more about that.<br /><br />For those on the fence about investing in Blu-ray, \\"Alice\\" provides a very strong argument. The crisp angles are razor sharp and each color's nuance is shown to best advantage.<br /><br />But my favorite feature on the Blu-ray disc is \\"Through the Keyhole-A Companion's Guide to Wonderland,\\" which is better described as a \\"video commentary.\\" Like an audio commentary, this bonus feature accompanies the entire film, which plays on one part of the screen or another while expert commentators like Brian Sibley, Paula Sigman and many others discuss the film, Walt Disney, and especially Lewis Carroll, in a very sensitive and non-sensational way, offering thoughtful insights and endless details.<br /><br />For DVD owners, you may want to keep your previous editions (there are three) to hang onto all the features, many of which have been included only on the Blu-ray this time around (though DVD player owners can still enjoy very nice \\"Reflections on Alice\\" featurette, which includes comments from the marvelously effervescent Stacia Martin and others). But I still don't think that absolutely all the marvelous features from the wondrous laserdisc of Alice have all been included on any DVD or Blu-ray.<br /><br />But if they want to do another reissue, that's fine with me. Like \\"Mary Poppins,\\" regular home video reissues keep the films fresh and in the public eye. If that makes me a little \\"mad,\\" well, don't let's be silly!

0451169514|5.0|I had read this book awhile back but I can say Stephen King will always stay as one of my favorite authors because only his haunted novels can bring chills up my back. His amazing talent is not only that he is a magnificent author, but also that he is able to have his readers relate to the fictional characters he create in his novels. This book was one great example of it since it involved young children and their obstacles through life and also goes on telling the haunted scenes 20 years after. I believe everyone can relate to one of the young characters in this book and this is what makes it truly scary and will haunt you forever. There is nothing more I can say about Stephen King, only that you should not miss out on reading all of his haunting novels especially this one!
B001CTDH76|5.0|If you enjoy watching Psych, you will enjoy The Mentalist! Granted there isn't the same type of silliness from Psych, but the characture of Jane has it's own humor I really enjoy.

As Jane is now connected with the CBI Dept. and is out for revenge of Red John, he builds fun relationships with the members of the CBI while solving murders up and down California.

B001CTDH76|5.0|What would happen if Monk and Columbo's DNA somehow combined? The Mentalist would be the result! And as the series progresses, especially when it gets its groove halfway through the first season, The Mentalist becomes one funny show. As with the GOOD detective shows and movies, the series begins to show all clues for you and yet trying to figure out the killer almost always will stump you - but it doesn't stump Patrick, The Mentalist!
0375703764|5.0|This book is great; it's the literary equivalent of Paranormal Activity or a horror ARG like Marble Hornets. It's convoluted and layered and involves a bit of re-reading and reflection. It's the entertainment equivalent of studying a textbook. It's not a book to be read in a sitting, or over the course of a few days. I highly recommend this- I recently passed my copy on to my 13 year old sister- it's a bit advanced for her, but I explained the confusion of the format and warned she might be a bit confused and she decided to give it a shot anyway. Give it to your teens!
1601251505|5.0|There are some who have been gaming for decades, who remember the days before online character builders and virtual gaming tables, days when you had to actually color in the numbers of your d20 with a crayon. In those days, fantasy was colored by the dark, gritty tales of Robert E. Howard, and lightened somewhat by the epic majesty of Tolkien...via books, that is, and not movies or video games. Pathfinder keeps this old-school feel, yet still benefits from decades of game design and play.<br /><br />While I enjoy and play D&D 4e, I still have a hunger for lower-magic flavored gaming. Of course, Pathfinder rules allow for a high-magic campaign but it doesn't force that style of game upon you like D&D 4e does. I hope to play Pathfinder for many years to come...I'm not so sure I can say the same for 4e.
B00005K3O0|2.0|If anyone has doubts about the general mediocrity of Robert Wise's work as a director, \\"Audrey Rose\\" should remove them. It's a tensionless, tedious bore that fails to emotionally engage the audience. It has many of the same problems as \\"The Haunting\\", a slightly better (but still poor) film, most notably a loose and unfocused script. Long before the end of the film, you wish someone would defenestrate Ivy and set the /audience/ free.<br /><br />The '70s color cinematography is dreadful, with bright, generally flat lighting that rarely makes any attempt to set a mood or express emotion.<br /><br />Wise was pretty much an uninspired \\"hack\\" director. When the script and actors were good, he usually delivered a good film. When not, he contributed nothing of his own to fix the problems, or enhance the better elements of the material. I'm partly biased, because I don't believe in reincarnation, but a much better film could unquestionably have been made from this material.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|Another fabulous story by a fabulous writer. It's the same format as her others, with the alternating stories taking place in two eras. Her characters are rich and engaging as always, and the story is simple but mysterious. You want to read it slowly so it doesn't end too quickly. You are instantly drawn in and reluctant to leave. A great read.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|No Original Trilogy?   When Ridley Scott released his Blade Runner, he released ALL the editions in anamorphic, on DVD & Blu, all cleaned up, and as well as it could be done. Even though he didn't like the US release and preferred his Final-Cut, he respected the fans enough to do it right. I'm glad he did, because I am one of those fans that prefers the US version.   When Francis Ford Coppola released his Apocalypse Now, he did the same thing with both the Original & Redux, even though he preferred his Redux over the Original. He too, respected the fans enough to do it right. I'm glad he did, because I've yet to meet anyone who liked Redux over the Original.  Lucas - WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU MAN!!! You must really hate us - YOUR FANS, to insult us with this piece of crap. Try to learn from your much BETTER fellow gods.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|It has been quite a long time that I have come across a book that I have had a hard time putting it down.  Although I have not finished reading it yet, it is an intellegent, well researched and fascinating read.  Not since Harry Potter, have I read a book with such interest and attention to detail.  The author's attention to details, from characters appearances, the settings and feelings gives me the ability to really visualize what is going on, where and with whom.  I do not particularly care for books written in the first person, because you do not get into the minds of the other main and minor characters, only the main character, this does not seem to bother me in the least with this book because it is so well written.  I do so hope there are more to follow with this series (hope it is a series!).  This is the first book on my new Kindle that I have actually paid for, at least more than $.99, and it has been well worth it.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys fantasy, history and science, or just a darn good read.

B002BWP4A6|4.0|Back at Bryn Mawr, a friend complained about all the artsy movies the campus cinema showed. My friend Joe told her, \\"Enjoy it now. After graduation, it'll be hard to find artsy films.\\" I'm glad I found this one.     \\"The White Ribbon\\" was an intriguing film; from the standpoint of a history student, I appreciated the tie-n with authoritarian Germany; as a mystery fan, I liked the slightly twisted finale. Some foreign films demand something of the viewer; they eschew happy endings, and force the spectator to think, to participate. Some historians posit that malefic social and psychic forces were at work in America and Europe around the turn of the century(Lesey's \\"Wisconsin death Trip\\"), and \\"Ribbon\\" delineates that period well.     That said, the film, though intriguing, runs long. Once you get the plot, it tends to hit you over the head ideologically, the one flaw, to me, in an otherwise fascinating movie.
0575083093|1.0|There might be some great, vast, ideas in this story and series. But this is morally void, space isn't the only vaccume here. In the first 100 plus pages we get - A hero/anti-hero, doesn't care if his staff die. they do, he doesn't care. a heroine, kills someone. a killer, takes a new job to kill someone. a baddie, hires a killer. a frozen person is asked for advice, his advice, kill someone. etc etc etc. There doesn't seem to be any character who cares about life, and consequently i can't care about any of the characters. Maybe there's a big alien thing that might kill a planet or a universe, and maybe some people who want to keep it secret. Will it kill everyone? - i hope so because i don't like any of these people at all. I don't care if they save the day or not. They don't care, why should i?  I got a hundred and fifty pages in, and this one is going to Goodwill. Just depressing.<br /><br />It has the components of the epic universe. Big ideas. a secret forgotten thing that does something. a person who isn't a person because he's somewhere else with the thingumies. a person who wants to know what the thing is. a person who wants to know where the person is. tab-A goes in slot-B. it makes a big story. it's depressing science fiction

B002ZG99N6|3.0|Ben Affleck seems to be building a director's career of crime thrillers based in his native Massachusetts. \\"The Town\\", like \\"Gone Baby Gone\\", is based on a novel: \\"Prince of Thieves\\" by Chuck Hogan. Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) is a career bank robber in the employ of an Irish gangster in Charlestown, Massachusetts. In the commission of a bank robbery, Doug's volatile partner Jim Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) impulsively takes the bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage. She is released unharmed, but, when Ben follows up to see if she knows anything that could incriminate them, he falls head over heels for Claire. Meanwhile, Jim is becoming increasingly violent, and both he and their vicious employer Fergie Colm (Pete Postlethwaite) are pressuring Doug to take on jobs that he would rather not.<br /><br />\\"The Town\\" benefits from Ben Affleck's natural affinity with the Irish-Massachusetts working class milieu, but neither characters nor plot are engaging. The film runs over 2 hours and begs to be edited more tightly. Affleck's performance is a bit flat, and dialogue is frequently unnatural. Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm), the FBI Agent working on the case, sounds like he can barely get the words out. Jon Hamm doesn't have much to do here, but he is conspicuously leading man material, not suited to a wooden supporting character. Had he and Affleck switched roles, both characters would have come off better. Pete Postlethwaite and Blake Lively are very good as Fergie and Jim's sister Krista, respectively. Those characters are essentially caricatures, but they do make a strong impression. Rebecca Hall is also appealing. But these actors can't make up for an overlong, tedious film.
B0042MDAL8|5.0|I am a 30-something Twilight fan.  Eclipse was my favorite of the books and probably my second favorite film so far.  Keep in mind that as of this date, Breaking Dawn has not been released in theaters yet...  Go Team EDWARD.  Blu-ray is great.  Didn't need any extras or bells and whistles since I am a mom with a young son.  I'm lucky enough to have time to watch the movie let alone any director's or actor's commentary.  &lt;3 it!
B0018PH3L0|2.0|Way overhyped, \\"Lonesome Dove\\" falls short in many categories.  Unless you are under 25 years old, as well as being a hard core avid fan of author Larry McMurtry; well then you'll have to really, really WANT to finish watching \\"Lonesome Dove.\\"<br />Yes, Danny Glover does a great job portraying Joshua Deets.<br />Yes, Robert Duvall does a fair job portraying Augustus McCrae.<br />Yes, Anjelica Huston does a great job as Clara Allen.<br />Diane Lane may have been attractive eye candy, but I doubt very much any woman of that caliber would ever have been actually in a one horse town's saloon as a whore.  She was cast inappropriately, which is born out later in the film by the town where the two uglier whores (one obese and old) took the young cowboys trade.  Diane Lane's character Lorena Wood was a little over the top for sweet, attractive, and over-played for the sympathy factor when she is kidnapped and abused by the half-breed, the Indians, and the filthy vermin vagrant liars and thieves.  Had she been as old and ugly as the other whores, nobody would have cared even half as much.<br />Robert Urich in the role of Jake Spoon had nothing consequential about it.  Another lame duck role, that I was surprised Robert Urich let himself be part of.  Robert Urich should have done commercial endorsements instead.  How desperate does an actor have to be to accept the role of Jake Spoon?<br />Glenne Headly's role as Elmira Boot Johnson was so pitiful the viewer can't help but be grateful she ends up terminated like she was.  What a useless piece of . . . . Although, I've dated women like her, and was married to a woman like her now that I think about it. Those examples however are alive and well, and who gives a rat's . . .<br />My biggest disappointment however was with Tommy Lee Jones in the role of Woodrow F. Call.  His heart just obviously wasn't in it as an actor.  I've seen performances in other films by Tommy Lee Jones that literally inspired me.  In \\"Lonesome Dove\\" he was so stiff and seemed to stumble over half-forgotten lines that he frequently was a little too obvious he almost forgot altogether as he blurted in his half-audible mumble.  He seemed so throttled back I wondered if he felt he was getting half of what he should be getting paid, so he only gave it half of an attempt as an actor.  He can't be proud of his part in this film.  The producer or director that tried to make him look like Kenny Rogers ruined an otherwise potentially great actor's reach.  What a waste to see Tommy Lee Jones reduced into a corncob and unconvincing character that seemed like he was fighting an urge to itch himself all over - throughout the entire film.  It was like casting a cat in a dog's role.<br />Chris Cooper's role as July Johnson should have been much more developed and it should have gone somewhere, but never did.  Kind of like hiring on at employers who made the interview speech so incredible, but then finding out they were talking about a fantasy of their own that they'd like to believe in - but nobody else can because reality is too otherwise persuasive.<br />The movie would have been absolutely tedious had it not been for Robert Duvall and Anjelica Huston.<br />Six and a half hours of a movie that never really goes anywhere, doesn't conclude anything, and leaves all the loose ends untied.  Good grief.  I'd rather watch Kevin Costner in \\"The Postman\\" than \\"Lonesome Dove.\\"<br />This movie is like sincerely courting a woman for 6 years and never getting more than a single kiss from her for your trouble, then one day you just stop hearing from her and she won't answer your texts, emails, or phone mail.  Anybody who raves and raves what a wonderful movie this is, also goes out in the spring and summer and sits in a patio chair to enjoy watching the grass grow - enthusiastically and fanatically, having a hard time figuring out why everybody else can't appreciate the awesome entertainment.  Gag me with a spoon.<br />Am I serious?  Not to put too fine a point on it, I'd rather watch 100 reruns of the exact same one night's July 2, 1955 debut broadcast of syndicated \\"The Lawrence Welk Show\\" than admit I watched \\"Lonesome Dove\\" more than a single excruciating time.

1567184855|5.0|This book, written by an educated man is a series of accounts by people who have had many lifes experences and have learned not to accept the blind faith that almost all religions demand. This book will open your mind to other possibilities to explain our existence as continually evolving and learning souls.

You don't have to abandon your religion to accept the knowledge Michael Newton has found, but it may put todays religions in thier proper place -- man made - not God. I have lived many lives and each of them for a reason, but I know and understand one thing: I am one of Gods Warriors and when the battle between good and evil comes, I shall be a part of those many, many souls that prevail over evil and what's going on today within the Muslim world - is not on the side of what God wishes.

B00000IFP6|4.0|In all the reviews, the criticisms are the same as the compliments:  the tempo and orchestration are \\"ear-opening\\".<br /><br />When you read what Mahler and Wagner said and did justifying performance modifications to Beethoven's scores, you get the idea that someone needed to separate the changes from the original.  Conductors felt they had to make adjustments to compensate for the fact that concert halls were much larger with more people in them than during Beethoven's life.  And then others added heft out of a need to accentuate the sense of awe and power in the music.  Well, Jonathan Del Mar certainly blew the eraser dust off of ol' Ludwig's wig!<br /><br />Still, one wonders what Beethoven would have thought about all this.  He was an advocate of new technology, promoting the, then, new Melzel metronome, for example.  He was not afraid to be seen as subverting tradition, and he said so in letters, etc.  Beethoven might have taken to modern string and brass instruments and techniques, such as vibratos and valves, doubling instruments to adjust for large halls, and so on.  We listeners have to rely on the academics, such as Del Mar.<br /><br />Zinman's smaller forces, bracing tempi, and extrovert ornamentation, are all refreshing and they let you hear the \\"corrected\\" orchestration so that you can hear the surprises if you're familiar with these works.<br /><br />With Zinman, the opening  Allegro con Brio of the Eroica really is an Allegro with Brio!  The funeral march is a little faster but with great sense of concentration.<br /><br />The Turkish march of the 9th does not make me think of a march, it makes me think of a race.  And I do not hear joy in the soloists and  chorus, instead I sometimes hear \\"am i gonna make it?\\"  But, i have heard other live performances even faster than Zinman!!<br /><br />The 5th is quite good, but does not erase memory Kleiber's recording with Vienna.<br /><br />The \\"motoric\\" 2nd movement of the 7th symphony can live or die on tempo, and it really lives with Zinman.<br /><br />And Beethoven's earlier symphonies have surprising punch and depth in these recordings.  They are given new life.<br /><br />Other reviewers have provided much greater detail than I care to.<br /><br />So, I am not completely sold on all 9 of Zinman's performances, even though they are all technically amazing.

I also learned quite a few interesting things.<br /><br />The credit default swaps (CDS) on collaterized debt obligations (CDOs) made off subprime mortgages with teaser rates were time bombs for the financial system.  They blew up the minute rates reset at their fully indexed level, and home prices stopped appreciating so borrowers could not refinance and started defaulting en masse.  Their explosiveness was compounded for several reasons. First, for every CDO outstanding there were often 10 related CDSs.  This multiplied the credit risk and systemic risk throughout the financial system.  That's how a small obscure sector of the capital markets ($200 billion in subprime CDOs) became a multi trillion dollar problem worldwide.  Second, also exacerbating this multiplier effect the investment banks used those CDSs to create additional synthetic CDOs (a Treasury + a CDS = CDO of identical credit risk and cash flow).  Third, the financial institutions also bought those CDOs and their toxic credit risk wiped them out.  This was the case for Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch.  This became a worldwide financial pandemic.<br /><br />AIG was at the center of the CDS/CDO explosion.  AIG often sold 10 CDSs on the same CDO.  So, when one of those CDOs defaulted, AIG suffered contractual losses 10 times greater.  And, if AIG could not make good on those CDS contractual obligations many of its counterparties would have to incur massive write downs on their respective positions affecting their thin capital cushion.  AIG had transacted with virtually everybody that matter.  It could have brought down a good part of the system.  And, that's why it was too connected to fail and the Government had to bail it out to preserve our civilization as we know it.<br /><br />Michael Lewis suggests the rating agencies were the main guilty parties.  Paid by the bond issuers they rate, the related conflict of interest rendered them incompetent.  The rating agencies never required loan level information regarding the portfolios they were rating.  They had no idea what the CDOs collateral consisted in.  Yet, CDO investor felt they held \\"trusted\\" AAA rated paper with no credit risk.  The rating agencies should have required loan level files and issued the relevant BB or even B ratings given the weak collateral.  The CDS and CDO markets would have never taken off.  The financial crisis would have been avoided.<br /><br />Michael Lewis focuses on a cast of characters that was relatively marginal to the scale of the CDS market.  They include Steve Eisman (the former boss of Meredith Whitney), Michael Burry, and the Cornwall Capital team who bought together no more than a $billion worth of CDSs for $20 million or less (2% premium).  Meanwhile, John Paulson was the real deal who bought more than $25 billion of such CDSs.  Yet, Michael Lewis will mention him just in passing.  To develop a full understanding of this story one should also read Gregory Zuckerman's [[ASIN:0385529945 The Greatest Trade Ever: The Behind-the-Scenes Story of How John Paulson Defied Wall Street and Made Financial History]] who focuses mainly on Paulson.  Michael Lewis did not have access to John Paulson.  He will still turn lemon into lemonade by making fascinating psychological profiles of the second tier of players he talked  to.  Who could ever forget the one eyed neurologist?<br /><br />I disagree with Michael Lewis on one count only.  He believes that when the investment banks went public, it triggered a moral hazard.  And, that they took on risks they would have never done when they were private partnerships.  However, we know many financial private partnerships were as reckless as any publicly held investment banks.

B001N1DPDE|4.0|Finaly my BK 2 arrived. Deffinately lived up to my expectations, and all the research I did.  Right out of the box was sharp enough to shave the back of my hand.  handle is comphy. really solid knife.  THE ONLY REASON IT DIDNT GET 5 STARS BECAUSE ITS KINDA TOUGH GETING IT OUT OF THE SHEATH. I DO LIKE THE SHEATH THOUGH.  IT FITS REALLY SECURE IN THERE. HOPEFULLY WITH TIME IT'LL GET OUT EASIER.  GO BUY ONE.
0385340540|1.0|The book was all filler -- there is very little story.  It is mostly trivia about hiding out in Italy and learning the language. The end was not exciting and not a surprise. I am disappointed in Grisham -- he could have done a lot better.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Sure the time is not dead-on accurate like a quartz movement watch, but you never need to worry about replacing a battery with this watch. Just swing it like a pendulum for a couple seconds and it starts ticking again. It's pretty neat that you can see all the moving parts in the backside too. For the price, you can't go wrong with this watch.
B000FC2PKG|1.0|I have never cared less for a cast of characters and apparently the author is in agreement with me.  She seemingly could not decide on her characters character, changing traits to suit the scene, engaging them in improbable conversations and involving them in impossible situations, not to mention sowing platitudes whenever she had the chance. Gardner started with an interesting premise, but just couldn't develop an interesting story.
B000RZIGVS|1.0|This set has episodes and whole discs that are totally corrupted, others have some or most of the episode intact and then you run into chugging, garbled, distorted sections that once again ruin the experience. This is a bad set, the packaging is unnacceptable, and I couldn't be more displeased with the product save that when they did play it looked great but its no consolation. Stay away from this product.
0670022411|2.0|Diana is a witch and scholar/professor who has denied her powers due to a tragedy in her past.  Matthew is a very old vampire/professor who encounters her using her powers (which she rarely does) while in the library and falls in love with her.  Enter old covenents and characters who attempt to keep the two apart.  Here is how this book breaks down the short version.  Talk - Talk some more - Reference quotations from old books no one has heard of - Talk some more - Reference more books no one has heard of- Talk some more - A very little action - Talk some more - Reference old books - Talk some more- A very little action.  The talk was interesting encough to keep me reading more as kept thinking something was going to happen.  There are a few scenes of action, but mostly alot of postering and threatening when tense situations arise.  By the end I felt like the book was one long tease.  I didn't even care about the last 40 pages and just skimmed this and still knew what was happening when i would stop and read yet another quotation.  Do people really know this many obscure quotations and their partner knows them too?  How many people talk like this? I found the quotations distracting and felt they took away from the story as you tried to decipher their relevance.  In short this book needs more action and less talk.  When I read books about witches, vampires, and daemons action is usally part of the story.  Not in this one. I think the author was trying to write a \\"smart\\" book but i just found it tedious.
0307269981|5.0|I just finished this book last night. Now I have to start the third book immediately! I was a bit lukewarm about the first one but this one really grabbed me. The suspense takes you right up to the last sentence. I picked up the third book sitting on my nightstand right after I finished this one to see if it picks up where this one left off.  Whew! It does, because this book leaves a lot unresolved.<br /><br />Like the first book, this one can get your head spinning with all the characters, who they are, what they do, where they live, etc. Add to that the Swedish names and places and it can bog you down if you try to absorb, remember and connect everything. But the story is excellent and Lisbeth Salander just gets more interesting and likable. Larsson definitely made up for whatever shortcomings the first book had.<br /><br />The story is primarily independent from the first book but the main characters remain throughout the book (expected). A number of characters from the first book fade away and new characters emerge, some far more sinister than the previous book's characters. Larsson does a great job developing his characters. He takes you through the streets and country roads and through the seasons and immerses you in the character's lives. I believe he will satisfy all but the most detail oriented reader. (Think Ann Rice)<br /><br />One problem with a book like this is it leaves you wanting more and there aren't that many books this good.
1439153663|5.0|Though it took me a month to read & finish this book, that is no reflection upon the quality of the book or how much I enjoyed it. I got sucked into the book from the very first page, fell in love with all of the characters, and worried about the family & what was going to happen to them. It would have been a very quick read, if I had actually made the time to read.<br /><br />My only criticism is how quickly the book ended. Because of how the book ended, you knew how the book was going to basically end, but I still wasn't prepared for the fast ending & would have really liked to have known more of \\"what happened next\\".<br /><br />I received a free copy of this book to read & review from goodreads.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Obviously this is a classic and a great story, and I enjoyed most of it, but just know that it is very verbose.  The descriptions in the book are very detailed and paint the picture well, but just know that Hugo may take many pages to describe something like the appearance of a house for example.  I admit I skipped a good bit of this book.  I really enjoyed the Jean Valjean story line but some of the others that got away from that were not as interesting.  Overall, I enjoyed what I read but now that I have the Kindle there are so many books I would like to read that I did not want to get bogged down in the slow parts of this one.
1597801585|4.0|This is a not-nice story about not-nice people trying to make their way in a not-nice future Thailand. It's full of corruption, extortion, murder, rape, industrial espionage, cutthroat diplomacy and strongman politics. No one is innocent. So it's pretty much the world we live in. Except for the unavailability of gasoline, the ubiquitous effects of advanced-stage climate change (an unpredictable monsoon, high sea levels, etc) and most terrifyingly of all, a biosphere ravaged by unrestricted genetic warfare.     The characters are all remarkably self-consistent products of the world they live in, which may make it difficult for us soft first-worlders to sympathize or identify with. But it remains a chilling vision of an all-too-possible future reality, brought to us by an author who clearly has command of his craft. Read it.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|This product includes eleven DVD's, many having several episodes on them of what is portrayed as a slice of life among the ruling elite starting with Caesar. Supposedly based on historic accounts I suspect it is probably as close to reality as a modern rendition can ever be, and the production itself is a class act. The actors are first rate, the video is superb, the script is flawless, and the whole thing comes packaged in a small book and slip case, with each DVD having its own sleeve within the book which also portrays images or information related to that disk. If you wish to travel back in time and see what life among the elite during the Roman Empire may have been like, then this is the product for you. This is the issue \\" Rome, the complete series\\" and has all of the seasons in one collection and would be of interest to anyone just wanting to see a good movie. Be prepared to see it in sequential steps since eleven DVD's is a lot of movie. As for me, this will remain in my video collection, along with I CLAUDIUS, and DAS BOOTE. As a footnote for those with children, there are some VERY GRAPHIC sexual scenes here and there so you may want to preview a disk. Again, this being based on best guess from historical accounts set aside, it is still a movie not an historical documentary.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|These are, by far, the most comfortable circumaural headphones I have ever worn for an extended period.  They are super light, weighing in at 8.5 ounces and the band distributes the weight across a large area. I can't even feel them on the top of my head.  There isn't too much pressure on the sides of the head either.  The only complaint I could make is that I would prefer velour pads because the vinyl pads it comes with can get a little bit tacky from sweat and sebum.<br /><br />They are stunningly beautiful as well.  I love the design with the gold rings.  I wouldn't wear them in public though, because circumaural headphones by their nature look dorky.  They also leak sound, being semi-open, but I don't think it will annoy anyone around you as long as you keep the volume at a reasonable level.  You don't have to pump the volume with these cans, because all the details will pop even at low volumes.<br /><br />That brings me to sound quality.  I am not very knowledgeable about sound technology but I have two good ears.  These are the best headphones I have ever owned.  They might sound a little flat to some people because they are used to cheap headphones that pump the mids or bass and flavor the sound.  These aren't reference headphones but they are in that direction.<br />Your enjoyment of these headphones will depend on whether or not your sound system can drive them.  An iPod will struggle without an amp.  I have heard that these are fairly easy to drive though, and my computer does it perfectly well.
B000FC2PKG|4.0|Good book! The mystery is unrevealed until the very end...The villain's repeated interference in the protagonist's life is highly ironic and very well portrayed. Good read for a plane journey! The ending could've been a little more crisp and exciting.
B0041KKYD8|4.0|I purchased the original after being told about it by a friend who was into these sorts of movies.  I likened it to the Deathwish series.  The original was brutal in its own right and maybe a little too graphic in the rape scenes.  The remake toned that part down slightly.  But the rest of it was pretty good.  I don't believe for a second that a city girl can last a month alone in the southern forest, but hey it's a movie, take it with a grain of salt. The revenge scenes were much more clever and believable than the original.  All in all much better concept, better execution.  It did drag on a little longer than it could have.

On the positive side the mounting parts on this cooler are first rate and make a stable base for this HUGE cooler.

B003VTZSFY|3.0|The book reads pretty well, which is good as it is lengthy and packed with information.    First, the title, Why the West Rules for Now?  I didn't see much in the book that would legitimately answer that question.  Another reviewer says that you will be bored by the graphs and charts.  I was, in a portion of the book, where the author turned to some data analysis with his social development score.  Or at least I did not think the data were meaningful, so I skipped midway through that chapter to the next one.  If you are looking for substantiation of the author's hypothesis then you may be disappointed.  (The author did not even convince me that it was a worthwhile question.)    But read on.  If you are interested in \\"patterns of history\\", for history's sake, as I am, then you will find the book interesting.  The author goes back several thousand years examining history with an eye to archaeological, geographical and sociological explanations of why we developed as we did.  That's why another reviewer may have preferred to call the book a \\"history of the world.\\"  For good measure throw in some biology and evolution to the mix with a perspective about noted authors such as Diamond, Gould, and Spencer.      So, for the conjecture on why the west rules for now - 2 stars.  For an interesting history of how we got to this point - 4 stars.

0345479092|5.0|This book was recommended to me by two mom friends. Although I didn't 100% agree with everything the author said, I feel that it was a very good resource with lots of common sense. It's the one baby book I'm making my husband read before our little guy is due. There are a lot of books out there and all of the information is overwhelming. If you only read one newborn \\"parenting\\" book. this should be the one.
B004A8ZWSS|1.0|The first 40 minutes were actionless, boring, and mostly unimportant to the plot. Maybe 5 or 10 minutes of the first 40 were necessary. There was no suspense and little action threw out the rest of the movie. And the action scenes were things like a stunning 10 mph boat chase and a lot of bad guys who can't hit close targets with automatic weapons.<br /><br />  Of the two plot twist one of them you suspect from the very beginning and both render the rest of the plot invalid. Johnny and Angelina were average at best, nothing spectacular or honestly even on par with their abilities. I have no doubt that their names are the only thing that kept this film from going straight to dvd.
B0026P3G12|4.0|Enjoyed the CD
B003PIUBZS|5.0|This show is nothing but bloody fight scenes and a handfull of hot sex scenes with a decent plot. It's the great show for guys.

After the first two chapters, I was ready to give up - but continued because of previous favorable reviews I had read.  I am glad i did!  Once I got to the fourth chapter, I was hooked.  I couldn't put it down.  I look forward to reading the rest of the trilogy.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|I was skeptical at first to read a book titled \\"Room\\" with a perspective from a 5 year old. After a couple chapters getting used to the narrative, I was enthralled with the book and couldn't put it down! It is amazing to see the interaction a boy has with his young mother and Jack's perspective on everything in the world. It is incredible to see how a child views things and is so innocent and not tainted by the real world.     Could not put the book down towards the middle and end because I was dying to know what would happen!
B002ZG99N6|2.0|The movie is great -- that's not why I gave this only 2 stars. The problem is that the special features listed on Amazon.com's description includes a director's commentary.  However, THERE IS NO DIRECTOR'S COMMENTARY.  That may not mean much to many people, but for me, I honestly wouldn't have bought it had I known this mis-information to begin with. I had already seen the movie; one of the main reasons I decided to buy the DVD was for the director's commentary. I was quite disappointed once I received the DVD to realize the commentary was not included on this edition. Of course, I had already unwrapped it by the time I realized there was no commentary, so now it's too late to return it to Amazon.com    Amazon, I have bought so many things from you in the past.... I use -- or USED -- this company for 99% of my purchasing of books, DVDs, electronics, toys, just about everything besides food and clothes.    No longer, Amazon.  I'm switching to eBay from now on.

I listen to it daily. \\"Never gonna leave this bed\\" is definitely the best one on the CD. \\"Curtain Call\\" is awesome as well, along with \\"How\\", and of course \\"Misery\\". ALL of the songs are great, though. I don't skip through any. Adam Levine is THE BEST.

B003XMUFGQ|3.0|Historically, Clapton seems to alternate between blowing us away, and periods where he seems determined to show he's really not that great. This album falls into the \\"leave me alone I'm taking a nap\\" category. There are a few funky decent cuts, and one great one (Run Back To Your Side), which shows what this cd could have been. Most of the cuts are things any decent guitarist could play: nothing special. It reminds me of the concert with Jeff Beck at Madison Square Garden, where Clapton also came determined to NOT play, in contrast to the concert with Steve Winwood, which is a must-have on both cd and dvd. Sorry,but I call em as I hear em!!

But it seems it was only Part One of Book 4.  It's now been over 5 years waiting for Part 2 of Book 4 (now called Book 5, acknowledged by the author as the \\"good half\\" of, well, whatever it is), and the author's website hasn't even published an estimated completion date since 2008.  Now I see that there are plans for a sixth and seventh volume!  When?  Nobody knows!    I don't recommend anybody start ANY of these books until the \\"final\\" installment has at LEAST a firm publishing date.

B004FRY9BU|5.0|The Set:  It's not totally necessary for the fan, but the shooting script and packaging is pretty cool.  There's nothing new on the disc itself, you just get a booklet with this edition.  I don't regret the extra pennies however, because it was definately worth the extra five bucks it was at the time.<br /><br />The Movie: What can I say that hasn't already been said.  It's a one of a kind film, that no one will be able to replicate.  It's fantastic and it instantly became my favorite film of all time.  Yes, I will say it.  He topped The Dark Knight.  The film is just so unique, and it has as many layers as its dreams do.  I was blown away more than I have with any other film.<br /><br />This edition may be way more expensive than its worth by the time you're reading this.  The extra script-book is nowhere near worth an extra 20 bucks.  But if you're a collector, by all means go for it.  The most important thing, is that the blu-ray itself is the same as the other editions.  Speaking of which, the blu-ray is pretty awesome in quality and features.  It definately delivered, where The Dark Knight lacked in the behind the scenes dept.  The movie looks astonishing.  I encourage you to not put out the extra bucks for this set, but you must own a copy of Inception one way or another.
0316067938|3.0|I read Twilight before the book became so incredibly popular, and although the content was out of my normal reading range, I have to say that Stephanie Meyer has a way with words that leaves a reader craving more. I was left at the end of each chapter with an insatiable desire to move on to the next chapter, and before you know it, the book was finished in only three or four sittings.     New Moon was of much less interest to me, and I actually had a somewhat difficult time reading it due to my strong will to slap Bella throughout the whole book. It was still very well written and interesting, but simply annoying. It was also by far my least favorite of the Twilight Saga.    Eclipse was another good read, and was also finished in just a few sittings. However, by this point, all of the information packed into the three books was beginning to blend together and become somewhat monotonous. Bella was still accident-prone, annoyingly humble, and somewhat whiny. Edward was still chivalrous and seemingly perfect. And Jacob was still a steamy asset to the book.     Book four of the series, Breaking Dawn was an interesting turn of events. I found myself being surprised in some occasions, and I felt like it was an overall good book. I know that it catches a lot of flak, but the book is good. It is interesting, well-written, and has a developed plot.

B000O8OTNC|2.0|This knife sharpener was mediocre at best for me.  It fits on keyrings easily.  The carbide and ceramic slots for sharpening knifes could not put a good edge on my EDCs, and actually managed to ruin the blade on one of them, so I no longer use this.  However, The diamond rod thingy is still an excellent sharpening tool, and i managed to hone many edges this way. Maybe it was the specific product I got, but the only useful thing on this sharpener is the diamond rod.

B000FC2PKG|4.0|Read this book in 2 days.  The story and characters quickly drew me in and I couldn't put it down. I found that Lisa Gardner added enough deviant, dark, sadistic human behavior to keep me interested but not enough to gross me out! Keep these $.99 thrillers coming.
B0012GMW34|5.0|Great album.  Not for everyone, a significant change for Carlos.  One must have an appreciation for jazz or jazz-rock-like fusion with some blues tossed in.  An incredible blend of Carlos' soulful, complex yet polished style with John's technical artistry.  I've long thought that Santana is the greatest guitarist ever and playing next to someone as gifted as McLaughlin shows his depth.  More technically gifted than Hendrix, Page or Clapton and more melodious and engaging than McLaughlin.  But it's like choosing between a Ferrari and a Lamborghini.  This is great stuff and anyone who appreciates great music will enjoy it tremendously.

Great plot, good writing.  The second book was pointless and a waste of time, taking over 130 pages to ramp up to hinting at a plot.  Predictable gratuitous violence the rest of the way, supergirl always comes out on top.  I won't bother with the third, can't imagine it gets any better.  The teaser at the end of Book 2 says Book 3 is more of the same, more of the Mutant superfamily marauding around Sweden. At least there will not be a Book 4.
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|Intel certainly makes faster chips than this guy, but for the price point i think this CPU is the the best value....by far. There are chips out there that give faster clock speeds, and at a lesser price, and people will argue they perform better for current games because they do not currently utlize multiple cores, and they would be right. But with that said, here's my thought. No game requires more speed than this chip to play flawlessly, and newer games/software that will require faster speeds will also very likely utlize more cores, and in that case this chip will preform really well having the 6 cores far better than those faster clocked quad cores. In addition these chips are notoreuos for being great overclockers. being a black edition it is also a snap to do. taking this chip up to 3.6 would be no chalange really at all. likely even posible with stock cooling (though i do not recomend it).

B0000009SM|4.0|Obviously this is the type of music for people who like this type of music. And one of Zappa's best compilations. However, I still have an old cassette recording of my original album. Even though the tape is quite well used it is still sonically superior than this remaster. I highly recommend the current owners of this collection; and you know who you are don't you? should have this great collection of songs properly remastered and a decent CD version produced. I will buy another copy if you do.
B002ZNJW0O|4.0|I read this book while working at a camp this summer and finished it in just a few nights worth of reading. I generally love all of Nicholas Sparks' books and this one was no disappointment. I love his use of military life and that all of his books are set in the South because I can really relate to them. No matter how old or how young the characters falling in love are, Nicholas Sparks always knows how to make a great story and pull at my heart strings.
B003EYVXUU|2.0|I was thrilled when I heard this movie was released by Hammer, but was soon disappointed when I began watching it. The quality of the DVD is fine, but the movie is as dull and slow as watching paint dry.
B0020BUWX2|4.0|This is a very short, very sad story.  I read the whole thing in a few hours, with interruptions.  I did find some parts to be kind of boring, mainly when there was more narrative than dialogue.  The story was primarily told in the form of flashbacks and Mia's memories.  I would not recommend this to young teens due to the language and sexual content.  I also found Mia's parents to be overly permissive about Mia's sexual activity even though the act itself was never gone into in any great detail.  (example :  When Mia told her parents about her new boyfriend, her mother offered to take her to planned parenthood, get her on the pill, and ordered her to buy a box of condoms.)  Granted, her parents are from the hippie/ love era, but still..eeekk.  I am all for being proactive, but I think at that point in the book, she was only 15!  Anyway, I also thought the book was overpriced for Kindle considering the length of the book.  I did like the book even though I found myself sobbing through most of it.  I think I will enjoy the sequel more, hopefully less of a tearjerker.  The sequel, Where She Went, is due out in April 2011.

B0012GMXYM|5.0|If it came down to Seargent Pepper, Dark side of the Moon, Caravanseri,Elegant Gypsy I would say that Borboletta is one of the best rock and best fusion and best jazz albums EVER MADE!  Back when albums were a 35 or 45 minuite experience I frequently would put on the cassette in my 1975 Dodge van for a long ride home and adjust my driving speed so that the last beautiful ringing tones of the end of the whole album were just ending as I came down my street or driveway! I wish I could tell this to Carlos. Now in these modern times of 3 minute songs and mp3s this experience is being lost! Imagine if sex/ lovemaking is only three minutes for this newer generation.Maybe it already is.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest--This is the third in the series by Stieg Larson about Lizbeth Salander. This is the one that wraps up the loose ends.  All three in the series; The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, and The Girl Who Played With Fire, should be read in that order prior to reading this one.  All three are \\"page-turners\\" and provided the best reading entertainment I had in quite some time.

B003TH3Q48|4.0|I have not seen every episode of Season 1 yet, but this one is the weakest I have seen.  Still, this episode introduces a character to be seen again in Season 2.  This series has some amazing locations.
1400110637|4.0|I am starting a small business and found the author's insight very helpful, but the book is geared towards those launching larger ventures.  A lot of common sense and a lot of good advice on taking those first steps.  My business will be smaller than those he talks about in his book so I found that much of what was outlined did not apply to my situation.  Definitely recommend for those with aspirations on a grander scale.
055357342X|3.0|I like George's writing.    I'd rather not continue with the series after three books. Just too long and no conclusion yet on the horizon.    Negatives:    1) He hasn't even published the fifth book in the series yet, even though there's an HBO series coming out for the first book.  2) His eyes were bigger than his stomach when he dedicated himself to writing seven novels. When was the fourth book published? How long ago?  3) I get the impression, he's not sure how to close down the series. I have other stuff to do in my life.  4) He has too many peripheral characters that he needs to name in the series. How does one keep track of it all? There are WIKI pages for that I suppose.  5) Chapters are titled by characters. Sometimes hard to find your place when you've put the book down for awhile.    Positives:    1) Great main characters.   2) Some great story lines.  3) Great language and writing style.
1594202842|5.0|You don't have to be part of the immigrant experience to be able to relate to some of the themes discussed in this book.     I'm Filipina, but I grew up in various Asian countries as an expat kid. In these countries, I attended International Schools based on the American system and was surrounded by students from all over the world -- most of them from Western countries. I saw first hand  the major differences in parenting styles from my parents and my friends' parents. I went on to attend college in the Bay Area, CA and having grown up the way I did, I can safely say that I'm  a \\"fusion\\" of Asian and Western culture.    Reading this book helped me to sympathize with my parents who faced certain challenges when raising kids in a culture so different from their own. But I also know from personal experience, that it's completely unrealistic for parents to raise their children in another country and not expect them to assimilate at all with the culture of the host country.     In her story, Amy comes to the realization that what works for one child may not work for another. While I would not want to be her daughter, nor would I want to raise any future children with such extreme methods, I never once doubted that she loved her girls.     I laughed a lot while reading this book. Amy has a warm, witty, and humorous way of writing that really drew me in. Plus her type A personality was just so over-the-top at times (even with her dogs) that I couldn't help but laugh!     Other things I experienced while reading this book was fascination, awe, shock, sympathy, and even a few tears. Any author that manages to elicit such a range of emotions is ok in my book. ;)
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I learned that responding to a phone text can be a bad idea - the sender's phone can easily be used by someone other then who you think it is.  I also learned that if you have a cataract problem you should get it attended to before you go blind.

B0049GYXDG|5.0|Disney's \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" finally comes to Blu-ray & the wait is well worth it. \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is a film that was just begging for a high-definition home transfer & now that it has been released in Blu-ray, you can see that this is true. I don't think there is another animated Disney movie that uses colors quite like Alice does. And on Blu-ray, the colors are the star of this film. So bright, so sharp, so...perfect! The colors are perfect, but the film itself is also pristine. Not a speck of dust or grain appears in the entire film. I was totally blow away by this release. Normally, when watching a high-definition picture, my first impression (if the picture is good) is \\"Wow!\\" & then as the film goes on, my brain settles in & I don't notice the high-def anymore. But with Alice, this wasn't the case. For the entire movie, I was blown away. I noticed how great the backgrounds are in the film. Check them out in the real world at the beginning of the film. Just fantastic! Then check out how they change when Alice enters Wonderland. Angles change. They're sharp & just like Wonderland itself, crazy!<br /><br />I must recommend highly to add this film to your Blu-ray collection. Besides the movie itself, there is tons of bonus material, including a running video commentary that runs along-side the film, which tells the story of the making of the film, as well as the making of the book. As with the other 1:33 to 1 Disney movies that have been released on Blu-ray before Alice, this disc has the absolutely useless feature of \\"Disney View\\", which adds annoying, out-of-place artwork on the sides of film to needlessly fill in your wide-screen TV. Does anyone really use Disney View?<br /><br />Anyway, the bottom line is this is the best looking Blu-ray I've ever seen & you owe it to yourself to own it.

031603438X|5.0|Keith Richards is a living legend and legends, almost by definition, are inaccessible as people. We know the facts of their lives and careers. We can know what Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix or Keith Richards was doing on a particular day 45 years ago, but only rarely do we see our rock `n' roll heroes as human beings, get a feel for what they were like as people. In \\"Life\\" Keith Richards isn't afraid to reveal the human being behind a rock star.<br /><br />To us the Rolling Stones are a preordained conclusion. We know what happened, but there was a time when it wasn't a certainty, a time when Mick Jagger, Brian Jones and Richards were desperately poor and only wanted to play the blues.  As fortuitous events aren't regularly scheduled and happen in ad-hoc ways, in \\"Life\\" we witness them go from squalid apartments to being the Rolling Stones living lives of excess in fashionable hotels.<br /><br />Just about every method was used and included in writing \\"Life.\\" In certain parts you can tell Richards is answering ghost writer James Fox's questions during an interview, some times it's straight narrative from Richards, and includes everything from Richards' diary entries to a recipe for bangers and mash.<br /><br />The narrative certainly isn't linear following Richards' stream of consciousness thoughts. But that stream doesn't become a murky river. For all of Richards' reputation as one of the truly mad men of Rock `n' Roll, he is incredibly insightful into the experience and  relates his experiences not only with a sense of history but with a sense of humor and irony that makes the reading of Richards' \\"Life\\" fascinating. A lot of \\"Life\\" is what you would expect from Richards and a lot of it is things you wouldn't expect of Richards. Such as an anecdote about an incident in which Richards and his friends exposed a bit of rebellious humiliation to an English teacher. Richards ties up the anecdote by telling us the teacher later went on to write an important book on English poetry.<br /><br />Along with the Beatles, the Stones are probably one of the core groups at the foundation of modern rock fans. Keith Richards' \\"Life\\" is an accessible, interesting and even fascinating look beyond the icon and to the person who is Keith Richards.he Beatles, the Stones are probably one of the core groups at the foundation of modern rock fans.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I just finished day 7, still on level 1. I definitely see a difference in my endurance. I'm following weight watchers while I do this so I'm watching what I eat and exercising. I'm not seeing a huge difference in my weight but that could be because I'm not that overweight. The cover says lose up to 20 lbs but I'm guessing that won't be me. After the first day, my legs were so sore but I still did the workout the next day. On day 4, my legs were still sore but by day 5 they loosened up. I can honestly say that when I squat I still feel sore but at least I'm able to walk around normally. My abs are definitely tightening up but I don't see a difference anywhere else. I'll post another update in about a week.    *Update: I'm now on level two. Gave myself 10 days on level 1 and was definitely ready to move on. Yesterday I finished day 5 of level 2. It's harder than level 1. I sweat more but I don't like level 2 as much as level 1. There are alot of plank position exercises so it's quite boring but I'm sticking with it. I have noticed though that level 1 and 2 don't really give the back of your arms a good workout. I hate my arms, especially the triceps which jiggle. So I modify some strength exercises to include a tricep workout. Still not seeing a huge difference in weight but I think I'm losing inches. Never measured myself but I see it. One suggestion, before you start this workout, take your measurements. I'm changing the star rating from a 5 to a 4 because level 2 is boring.
B00006GO9Q|2.0|there are 107 reviews on this album, so I don't have much to add. I am into jazz music myself & have at least 16 of his recordings. His finest work was done during his \\"Quintet\\" tears with Coltrane. Nobody could play a ballad like Miles with his muted trumpet. On the up tempo stuff, he wasn't the best technician, but his spacing was great. Miles once said(about jazz); \\"if you ain't got nuttin' to say, don't say nuttin'.\\" He sure had nothing to say on this album. 2 stars.

And, of course, the movie is AMAZING! I honestly do not understand how someone can say this is boring or not good. I REALLY LIKE THIS MOVIE! If you're skeptical to watch it, at least try it out. It's a thrill. Honestly, I think the whole movie they trying to make you feel like a bystander. It's one track, intuitive, and fast-paced even when you know it probably isn't. It's an incredible film. But, why did its soundtrack win over Hans Zimmer's Inception soundtrack. He's my all-time favorite.

1936594293|5.0|Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a book of great literature merit. The articulate language and complex characters draw the reader into the story of sisters trying to find their place in life. The way in which it is written is rare to find in today's society, creating a sense of mystery and the unknown about society of the past. Elizabeth Bennett, the heroine of the novel, is a character that is easily relatable to for women both in the time that it was written and for modern women today. She struggles internally to find where her heart truly belongs, and leads the reader to question whether they themselves are actually proud and/or prejudiced.

0760703329|5.0|There is no way I can review Shakespeare's Complete Works any better than it has been already done many times by some very smart people -- but I want to comment on the physical quality of this edition.<br /><br />Mind you, I already have an edition, printed in England about 50 years ago, that has sentimental value (a supportive English teacher half the world over gave it to me with a praising inscription) - so I wasn't looking for another copy.  But then I came across this leather bound edition in a Barnes & Noble store, and I found this book so extraordinarily GORGEOUS that I would have been unable to leave the store without it.  What a surprise for that kind of money (about $18).  What a gem!<br /><br />Everything about this book is just beautiful.  The smooth and shiny bonded leather provides an elegant background for gold and red rich classic ornamentation in the front, on the spine, and on the back cover. The spine has four raised hubs, giving it a 3-dimensional look -- like on old classic leather-bound tomes.  A handsome colorful portrait of Shakespeare (and another one, in black and white inside) completes the sophisticated look.<br /><br />It is a hefty tome (2.6 inches thick), but very sturdy (pages are sewn-in).  The sides of pages are perfectly gilded and smooth to the touch.  Inside, the print face is nicely old-fashioned, stylistically appropriate to the book. Additionally, the very dark/black print provides great contrast with cream-colored acid-free paper.  The book also has stunning, richly colored marbled end-papers, and a sewn-in golden silk ribbon book marker.<br /><br />It is true that pages are slightly translucent, but I don't see it as a problem -- the print is black and sharp enough to stand out quite well, so the faint shadows from underneath don't interfere with reading.  For anyone who uses reading glasses, the size of the font will be just fine.  Young people with good eyes will have no problem, but some middle-age readers may have to admit to themselves it's time for reading glasses.<br /><br />I only have one complaint: the margins on pages are too small/narrow. When the inner margin is thin, and the book is thick, it makes it harder to read -- you must keep the book as widely open as possible to see letters close to the seam (resting the book on a lap desk helps).  But even with that issue, I think this edition still deserves 5 stars.<br /><br />Kudos to the anonymous designer of this book (I have a hunch that small margins were the idea of bean counters, not the designer). You have created a splendid book that is a joy to hold and look at, and I am happy to display in a prominent place in my home.reading glasses.

B003KUSUG8|4.0|I think this album is a good start for Eminem toward recovering his life and career.  His first albums were different than anything I had listened to before and were heavily played.  Then he got caught up and his music turned to crap.  I'm glad in a selfish way he's had the type of experiences he's had or he would never have produced the material that he has that makes him unique.      The tracks that stand out for me are:  Almost Famous.  The female vocal is haunting in that song.  Space Bound.  I couldn't believe this was on the album, but I'm glad it is.  Going Through Changes.  This is a great track with a good sample of Black Sabbath.  Won't Back Down.  I think Pink made this song stand out for me.  She's the perfect bad ass female to counter his presence.  Love the Way You Lie.  This is the first song I heard off the album and the reason I looked into it.  It's reminiscent of the Shady of old, but new.  I was a little surprised to hear Rihanna on it all things considered, but it was a good choice and I enjoy the song quite a bit.    Those are my favs, the rest of the album is still good, but none really have the \\"it\\" factor for me.  They're great compared to some of his previous couple of albums.  I'm kinda glad he's got some new producers to work on his stuff.  I like Dre, but I could easily figure out the one song he had on the album and it was just a little worn, as were the lyrics.      All in all, this is a good album from Em, I just hope he can keep it up and stay with us.
1589795474|3.0|Overall the book has some good points.  It's more about teaching your kids good lessons about money than how to become a millionaire yourself.  I can sum up the book in one sentence:  Be frugal, save 15% of your income, buy used cars and teach your kids how to be independent money makers so you don't end up supporting them in your old age.  These aren't really secrets.  It reaffirms some of the \\"tough\\" decisions you need to make to become a millionaire.
B004G7FFF8|5.0|In October 1985, Leslie Howard embarked on a journey, one which became his Everest expedition. When it ended, in April 2009, he had reached the summit of recordings: 7,256 minutes (almost 121 hours) of every note that Ferenc (Franz) Liszt wrote for the piano. The first 95 discs were recorded by 1999, and four additional ones (Liszt: New Discoveries) were made over the next 10 years as new manuscripts were discovered. In 2010, Hyperion Records, founded by the late Ted Perry who gave the green light to Howard's journey, decided to issue a box set of all 99 discs, and what we have is a magnificent product that no Liszt lover should be without.<br /><br />Since almost all of the individual CDs have been reviewed separately here on Amazon, I will endeavor to review the physical aspects of the set. First, the box: it is quite sturdy, very smooth to the touch, and not at all like some of the cheap offerings from other classical labels. Inside are the 99 CDs, arranged as they might be if sitting on a CD shelf, and color-coded by sleeve as follows:<br /><br />Discs  1-6: Etudes and early works<br />Discs  7-19: Major original compositions<br />Discs 20-29: Dances, marches, & transcriptions of Liszt's own works<br />Discs 30-36: Pieces on national themes<br />Discs 37-49: Operatic fantasies, transcriptions, and paraphrases<br />Discs 50-61: Concert transcriptions<br />Discs 62-69: The Beethoven transcriptions<br />Discs 70-79: The Schubert transcriptions<br />Discs 80-94: Rare works and new discoveries<br />Discs 95-99: Music for piano and orchestra<br /><br />Each individual cardboard sleeve lists the contents for that individual disc, with track timings. Sitting on top of the discs is a very slick booklet, which contains the following:<br /><br />-A biography of Leslie Howard.<br />-A disc and track index (without timings).<br />-An introduction to Liszt's music and the recording project itself (in four languages).<br />-An index of Liszt's piano music by \\"S\\" number (based on the numbering done by Humphrey Searle); at the end of each entry, numbers indicate where a particular piece can be found, by disc and track location.<br />-An alphabetical title index of Liszt's piano music, again with numbers to locate the piece by disc and track.<br />-Reproductions of photos (yes, there are photos of Liszt !) and other depictions of Liszt.<br /><br />In addition, one may download, at Hyperion's web site, all of the liner notes which accompanied each CD release over the years, including original color artwork of each disc cover. Those liner notes and artwork can be downloaded at this page: [...]<br /><br />I visually inspected each of the 99 discs, and they are all flawless, which itself is an amazing achievement. The set arrived at my home two days ago, and I have listened to 5 discs (most of which are timed well over 70 minutes). The recorded sound is transparent, detailed, and full (but uncongested), something that Hyperion has perfected and which other labels only strive for. Howard's playing is amazing; there may be better versions of individual pieces, but I doubt that his general level of excellence over the long haul can be matched, at least not in my lifetime.<br /><br />To be able to buy this set for $274 (which is what I paid) is a steal, a bargain, a no-brainer ... use whatever similar analogy you'd like. That works out to about $2.77 per disc. In this year 2011, the 200th anniversary of Liszt's birth, to have a set like this, at a price like Hyperion is offering, is a gift. Thank you to Leslie Howard and to Hyperion for enriching the lives of classical music lovers everywhere.on the numbering done by Humphrey Searle); at the end of each entry, numbers indicate where a particular piece can be found, by disc and track location.<br />-An alphabetical title index of Liszt's piano music, again with numbers to locate the piece by disc and track.<br />-Reproductions of photos (yes, there are photos of Liszt !) and other depictions of Liszt.<br /><br />In addition, one may download, at Hyperion's web site, all of the liner notes which accompanied each CD release over the years, including original color artwork of each disc cover.

1579128149|5.0|Perfect format for the subject. Witty commentary and great photos. Can not put it down. Every time there news, for instance of rare earth 'cornerings',out comes the book for a bit of  sticky-beaking. Like a bit more theory on valency or whatever - why do they combine ( the elements ) the way they do?
0375842209|5.0|I am an avid reader and I have to say that it's been a while since I've read anything as capivating as this.  I still find myself thinking about Liesel, Max, Rudy, Hans, and even the \\"loving\\" Rosa.  For the past 3 days I was unable (and unwilling) to put this book down.  This is destined to be a read multiple times within my family.  I even purchased another copy of this book knowing that I will lend this book to many others (Liesel's story must be shared), and someone along the way will feel like a Book Thief.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Don't listen to the critics! True, the storyline isn't all that unusual but the music, costumes & CHER are fabulous!!  I didn't realize Christina has such a powerful singing voice--I LOVE her songs!  I've seen it 6 times & would have kept going if it was still playing :)  Gotta have the dvd.
B000JMLFLW|3.0|Sorry, I don't want to step on any toes, but I found Pride & Prejudice to be slow and plodding. In fact, I finished it only for the sake of doing so. Since it was written by a woman and is told primarily from a woman's perspective, given its considerable popularity I can only assume that it is enjoyed more by women than by men. If it wasn't a classic I might even have given it two stars (and I enjoy many of the classics very much).
0525951652|4.0|I'm going to try to keep this short, because there are already enough reviews for this book, on both sides of the argument. I've read a good amount of them.    First, let me acknowledge the bad ones. Yes, the characters are not very deep or developed. The dialogue is often over-simplified, generic and downright uninteresting. The coincidences, where the same people keep running into each other all over the world, are often unbelievable. This is certainly no literary masterpiece. Nor does it present the historical accuracy of a text book. I don't think it's meant to be either.     It is entertaining. It provides those of us with little WWI knowledge a starting place to pursue more information and continue our own research if we so choose. I do. It's why I read historical fiction. And, keep in mind all you critics, this IS historical fiction. FICTION. It's entertainment.    Personally, it kept me turning the pages. It didn't slow too terribly at any point. (I say \\"too terribly,\\" because I'm not a fan of extended sections on military maneuvering. But some people are. To each his own.) I wanted to know what happened next and, most important for me, it succeeded in inspiring me to get on my computer and look stuff up. Since finishing this book, I've done quite a bit of additional reading on Lenin, Trotsky, WWI geography and German history. I read historical fiction because I find non-fiction, typically, to be very dry and boring. Mix in some individual personalities and some drama, which I'm pretty certain existed concurrently with the history anyway, and now I've got a reason to learn more.    Any book that can do that for even one person, in my opinion, is a success.    P.S. I've not read any of Ken Follet's mass market stuff, but I have read Pillars of the Earth (which I liked very much and valued for inspiring me to read more about that period's architecture) and World Without End (which I liked a good amount less than Pillars of the Earth.)
0143038583|5.0|This is a great book.  By examining three sources of food: the industrial food supply, the organic and beyond organic food industry, and the hunter gatherer, Pollan provides not only excellent contrast between the three but also illuminates where our food actually comes from, regardless of which source you choose.    Pollan does an thorough job of exploring how the US corn subsidies have shaped America, from how the land is farmed through to the shape of the people who live and eat in the US.  He also examines how regulation in the US has shaped and perhaps perverted the organic food industry, on the one hand making it more viable, and on the other making it more deceptive.  I found the extensive description of Joel Salatin's farm to be uplifting and hopeful.  I also liked the contrast that Pollan provides through his section on the hunter gather food supply, which is, of course, much shorter.  Confronting your food on the hoof and not only shooting, but also retrieving and dressing it before you eat it is something that most Americans have never done.  Truthfully, most of us have little idea of where our food actually comes from.  This book does an excellent job of dispelling that.    Finally, this book is a very compelling read.    If I have any complaint about this book it is that it focuses on so much on how things are done in the US, and it left me wondering how the industrial food chain differs in other countries, but I suppose the author had to draw the line somewhere.  That complaint, however, is not enough to warrant losing a star.

0451209338|3.0|This was my first try at a Daniel Silva piece and it was less than I expected.  His writing is smooth and entertaining, but the story is a little flat.  The action is even flatter.  I expect my heros to be heros.  In stories featuring these heros I expect the hero to do something...I don't know...heroic.  The only action that surrounded Allon in the entire story was described through the eyes of one of the characters and he was looking away at the time???  I kept hoping for more and read on looking for it, but never really found what I was looking for.  While I see the potential of Gabriel Allon, I didn't read it in this book.  Might try Silva again.  Might not.
B000PKX2KA|4.0|Quick delivery of the correct product as advertised. Units charge well and retain their charge well too. Range is difficult to judge, depends on too many factors. Sound quality is fine. Operation the same as any other unit. Charge stands are good, better as those units like Cobra with just a wire, this looks more professional. The only minus point is a bit the clip for at your belt, a bit too plastic but that is only minor. I prefer these above Cobra units.
142314189X|5.0|I read the percy jackson series and i loved it! my favorite character is annabeth. i love her personality! i also love percy's character. My favorute book in the series is probably the last one which is the last olympian. it is when the whole story os untold and the war finally happens. percy finally hears the prophecy and goes up against kronos to save olympus. it is very suspensfull and includes a little bit of romance which in my opinion is a good touch to the story. It basically gives you play by play about what is going on in the war and the description is so good that you can see it all happen in your head. I have read the whole sries and the lost hero which is part of the next series: heroes of olympus. dthat series still includes percy and annabeth and their other friends but the main plot is different and the main characters aren't always them. for example in the  lost hero (the first and only book in the series so far) percy doesnt come up at all even though he plays a really big part in it. i won't say much about it though to avoid ruining the story.annabeth makes an appearance but she doesn't stay for long. the next booki however is beleived to be from percy's pint of veiw and in  this one he is surrounded by a completely new crowd of people ( hopefully friends and not foes) anyways, I think everyone should read this book no matter how old they are. the idea of the story is really good. I love how old mythological gods, characters, and monsters come in but their persomality is juist like real people in the modern world. i like the idea of the greek gods moving to the western civilization. The characters are very fun and lovable. The way the characters talk and their sarcasm is also awesome. It will keep you laughing until your stomach hurts. Rick riordian did an amazing job in this book. i definatley reccomend it and think everyome should read this.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|This mic works perfectly!  Many of the reviews that I've read on here complain about the audio being too soft, but I haven't had a single problem.  The only drawback to this mic is the fact that it records in mono.  But even that isn't too much a deterrent; just download Audacity for free and edit it in there, or use your video editing program to do it.  That's really all there is to it!  Great little mic for a great little price!

0312600844|5.0|ASIN:B004L62J9Y Dead in a Gauzy Veil    It is not difficult to figure out why so many of Amazon readers are simply trashing this book. This is a piece of Americana which takes some self awareness to accept. The book is about characters (every day people with some peculiar hang ups)that are simply floating through life trying to find a raft that would take them to an island of contentment.  But how to find that? More important, is that possible?  Patty, the 'auobiographer' starting from her early life, felt ridiculed by her father and ignored by her mother, with three sibs intellectually brighter than her.   In the long narration -yes, the book is very long- we see her struggling, hating her parents and still in some ways making her life more successful than her siblings' and also destroying it. This is not a detective novel where a plot analysis would spoil the end for the reader, so I can say that somewhere she becomes a self destructive, jealous, envious, near alcoholic depressive and in that mode alienates her own children. She somehow cannot accept Joey's girl friend and later his wife. One is never sure what happened to Jennifer except by the end, Patty is scared of not having her support, for it becomes when she has left her husband and lover, her only support.  Walter, the husband, the self made conservationist, with an alcoholic father and brother, going through college to become a lawyer on just a few hours sleep (in between working and taking care of parents' run down motel)has almost a Lear like quality in his trying to spread his goodness and getting nothing but betrayal in return. The only person Lalitha, so young, that he has to fight off his fatherly feeling for her, who does not, ends up causing him the worst pain.   Richard Katz the Iago who actually lets himself be seduced, (in one of the most comic stretch of the book, where Patty 'sleepwalks') almost escapes unscathed in the emotional wars, because he is totally narcisstic and ends up in a relationship with a woman of influence.   Its Patty, Patty, Patty who is the heroine, the hope and despair and the final salvation of the novel.   Some readers who have complained of lack of interesting character, meaningful metaphors (must be Pat Conroy fans), are correct in some ways of their assessement.   Point is: the characters are alive, human and hardly seem like a product of an author's imagination, they move effortlessly, showing their shallow sides with no hesitation and no explanation. It is for the readers to imbue them with meaning: which is perhaps the greatest quality of the book and the writer.  The language is pithy without being picturesque. Old timers such as this reviewer and others of a very mature age would perhaps writhe at the long-never ending-graphic description of sexual activity. The best (or the worst) being Joey's meeting with his girl friend in a Manhattan apartment of his aunt. It is the seamless nature of the writing that, although not agreeable to many, makes this not merely a distraction. Perhaps it reflects today's mores.   It is a family tragedy. Children growing apart from their parents and in turn suffering the same fate so movingly depicted by Pearl Buck in the Good Earth (Sons, A House Divided). But Jennifer puts it to her mother that how she could deprive her children of the grandfather's love that one experiences the tragedy being perpetual. The tragedy is made all the more profound by the writer draining every bit of sentimentality from his writing. I am surprised at this being an Oprah book club selection: for her group of readers look for a more heart wrenching writing pretty well absent from Mr. Franzen's pen.   The book runs at a marathon pace: in the beginning, slowly, succinctly and without in any way getting the reader away from enjoying the race. Yet in the end, when it is all Patty, that the writing picks up a a much faster rate, and the true building of characters culminates in a triumphal ending. The last hundred pages could rank with the masterpieces of the last two centuries' greatest writers and writing. Mr. Franzen fearlessly distills the whole story in a pattern of explanation that takes one's breath away.   Comparing it with some of the greatest American books of the past may not be justified in 2011. I felt reading Freedom, the thrill I experienced in reading Arrowsmith, Grapes of Wrath and the poetry of Robert Frost for the first time.   This should take its place among the giants of modern literature.  The passionate nature of  Walter's wanting to preserve nature, not letting the songbirds murdered by feral (or even domestic) cats, produces a feeling in readers that can easily be taken for the puzzlement of what's going on in the world. The Left and the Right clash in the book: without commentary. Walter's unabashed views on corporate America, Bush-Cheyney's Iraq war (Tony Blair's name does not show up)and Joey's early Republican views of making money are done with admirably clarity and restraint.   A million song birds killed in a day is sad, but unavoidable; tragic, too but pet cats have to hunt.   This is a novel: one man's point of view. One should read it, not fight it's points, right or wrong. One has to enjoy the writing cadence which uplifts a soulful story.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|I love this movie. My mom and dad love this movie. They begged me to get the DVD so they could watch it over and over.     I can't attest to the historical accuracy of all the elements, but it's definately realistic and true to the rugged nature of the old west. Characters are not invincible, people die, even 'good' characters have faults and flaws, and *gasp* they have to reload the appropriate amount of times for the type of guns they're using.    An excellent story about men and women trying to find their place in the frontier.
0596805888|5.0|This is one of my favorite books ever!  I loved to cook long before I became a geek.  I have cooked/baked enough to know \\"what\\" works but didn't ever know \\"why\\" it worked that way.  I started reading this book from cover to cover.  Chapter 2 \\"Initializing the Kitchen\\"  covered everything from knives to pots and pans - what types there are of each and \\"how\\" each type works thereby helping me know logically(validating my old trial and error techniques) which item works best for what.    I then decided to skip around based upon the recipes. Understanding why 25 degrees is so important in baking cookies caused me to try out a new cookie recipe in Chapter 4 and sent me back to Chapter 2 to calibrate my oven temperature (using multiple thermometers or doing an experiment with sugar - I feel like I'm doing my kids science projects).  The book is loaded with information but written with humor.  I found it to be a fast, informative and entertaining read.  I've even read aloud to my dad from this book and found he enjoyed the explanations as well.      Super Bowl update: During the Super Bowl my pizza chef son-in-law made his best pizza dough ever.  He had used bread flour instead of all purpose flour.  Everyone was discussing why that might matter.  I went and got the Cooking with Geeks book.  We learned that bread flour has a higher percentage of gluten and gluten \\"forms a 3D mesh that traps air generated by organisms such as yeast..\\"  This book is moving from my geek book shelf to my coffee table.
B000006Z0T|4.0|\\"Russian Roulette\\" is on par with Accept's earlier and more acclaimed albums \\"Restless & Wild\\" and \\"Balls to the Wall\\".<br /><br />The first 7 songs are quite decent:  the driving speed metal of 'TV War'; the catchy 'Monsterman'; the title track (probably Accept's best and most interesting song); the slower 'It's Hard to Find a Way' (which is like a combination of 'Losing More Than You've Ever Had' & 'Winterdreams' from Balls to the Wall); the Iron Maiden-esque \\"Aiming High\\" and \\"Another Second to Be\\"; and lastly the 7 minute slow and heavy \\"Heaven is Hell\\".  The final 3 songs are mediocre.<br /><br />I don't think this album is \\"commercial\\", like many reviewers claim.  It ranks up there with Accept's best albums.  This is straight 80's heavy metal.
B000002L42|5.0|I have listened repeatedly to this album- never gets stale, never gets old- the reworking of old favorites is fresh and inventive.
B003HARV98|5.0|This is a startlingly honest and refreshing pop album. Marina sings about things most singers wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole, being self-deprecating and harsh in a way that reminds me a little of Fiona Apple, though they sound nothing alike. Some critics have jumped on this album for her vocal delivery being over the top, but I think it works with the songs, and I like her voice. I don't think songs like \\"Are You Satisfied?\\" and \\"Obsessions\\" would hit as hard with a more even-keeled delivery. She really brings them to life. The production is intricate and dense, and it complements the songs well and supports her singing.    The comparisons to Florence & the Machine and Lady Gaga don't make sense to me. While they are all talented women, Marina's music doesn't sound like it was written for a teen horror flick soundtrack, and it doesn't have the slick coolness of Lady Gaga. Her voice is raw and jumpy and she sounds very exposed, despite the heavy musical arrangements. To me, this sounds like the music of someone who is doing this because, no matter what anyone says, and no matter her flaws and how her pursuing this might affect anyone else, she can't NOT do it. It is an interesting perspective, and aside from that these songs are very catchy and fun to sing along to.
B001AACEP8|3.0|Katy Perry has been around a lot longer than people might think. Along with Ke$ha, she had been attempting to break big several years prior to the success of \\"I Kissed a Girl\\" and the subsequent release of her album \\"One of the Boys.\\" All of that shows here, because not only does Katy try to cover her bases lyrically, but also sonically. It adds up to some fun moments, but when the album is viewed as a whole, the cracks become apparent.    One of the Boys: The leading track and a lyrical standout. The sound is generic pop-rock, with the lyrics reading like a PG-13 Disney cut. It's good for what it is, and had single potential. B    I Kissed a Girl: The trashy hit of its summer, surely one's opinion on this song will come into play when purchasing the album. Its a highlight, with nothing sounding quite as good as it musically. That stomping beat hooks into the brain and doesn't let go. A-    Waking Up In Vegas: This one can be overlooked on the first few plays if it hasn't been heard before on the radio, but it gradually starts to add some appeal. It's still one of the least enduring tracks on the album, though. B-    Thinking of You: This single wasn't too successful, which is a shame because it feels genuine, a rarity on this album. It seems like Katy has decided against going in this direction on \\"Teenage Dream\\", but this remains a great, enduring standout. A-    Mannequin: Katy really seems focused on the vocals on this track, but the beat is back to the generic pop-rock of the title song, so this is easy to skip and not be missed. B-    Ur So Gay: Even trashier than the lead single, this song walks a fine line between disgusting gay-baiting and actual fun. I'll go with the latter, but it's a polarizing track. B    Hot N Cold: The second single is nearly as infectious as the first, without being laced with trashiness. This could've been on \\"Teenage Dream\\" with its more electro beats, and holds up well over time. B+    If You Can Afford Me: This is just unnecessary. Katy tries to pull off singer-songwriter when she is already pining to be the next big pop star, so this song should have been left off the album. C-    Lost: Another bright moment of genuine emotion from Katy. If her goal was to be a 'real' artist, this would be the direction she should have headed. Unfortunately it's not, so this is just a gem in the rough. A-    Self Inflicted: This goes along with \\"If You Can Afford Me\\"; the album would have been a leaner listen without it, and it just doesn't mesh well. C-    I'm Still Breathing: A dark, brooding track that should have closed out the album. Paired with \\"Thinking of You\\" and \\"Lost\\", this track shows Katy at a vulnerable point in her life, which is refreshing. B+    Fingerprints: This track is just annoying. She tries to raise a rebel flag when it's obvious that she just wants to fit in (see: success of \\"I Kissed a Girl\\" and attention-whoring on \\"Ur So Gay\\"). It also loses another half of a grade for not even having a good hook. D    Overall, the singles make a worthwhile collection from the album, with the addition of the other ballads. \\"Teenage Dream\\" is a much better album than this, due to Katy's complete abandonment of ever being viewed as legitimate. Give that album a spin if you want to have a good time, and throw the first two singles from this one in for good measure.    Recommended: I Kissed a Girl, Thinking of You, Hot N Cold, Lost, I'm Still Breathing

B000A2UBN4|5.0|Few motion picture remakes are as good as the film they're based upon. Director Martin Scorsese's 1991 version of CAPE FEAR is a rare example of a reworking that actually exceeds the original. Here's why:<br /><br />1.) Bernard Herrmann's glorious score is powerfully enervating in Dolby stereo.<br /><br />2.) The De Niro Max Cady has better reasons to torment Sam Bowden, an attorney who betrayed and helped convict his own client (Cady) by holding back exculpatory evidence. In the original version, Bowden's eyewitness testimony at Cady's assault trial helps to procure a \\"guilty\\" verdict. While stewing in jail, Cady convinces himself that Bowden is solely responsible for his eight-year prison term, rather than his own wrongful behavior. It's unsustainable illogic, thus a poor reason for revenge.<br /><br />3.) The family dynamic. In the '91 film, daughter Danielle is rebellious to both parents and even welcomes Cady's attention, to a point. In the earlier work, daughter Nancy is a good child who is simply terrified of her stalker. Nick Nolte's Sam is more 3-dimensional than Greg Peck's wooden lawyer; he's also a heel who cheated on his wife. The original movie has no hint of infidelity. Leigh Bowden (Lange) isn't a complete innocent, either. She's been psychologically torturing husband Sam over his indiscretion for some time now.<br /><br />4.) Max Cady himself. Robert De Niro plays him as a genuinely ferocious demon, while Robert Mitchum is sinister but far more low key. De Niro drew upon early efforts with director Roger Corman for the coarse mountain-accented Max. In Corman's [[ASIN:B000SK5ZFC BLOODY MAMA]] (1970), he was Ma Barker's psychotic son, Lloyd.<br /><br />5.) Superior special effects in Scorsese's picture make the climactic stormy river sequence a nerve-shattering experience, especially on the big screen. The freedom to depict graphic violence also means the newer film packs a more powerful punch.<br /><br />6) The finale. De Niro's demise is unforgettable; perhaps his best screen moment. In the original, Sam shoots Cady in the shoulder and the wounded Max quietly lays there while Sam crows that he's going back to jail for life. By contrast, the '91 Max gets everything that's coming to him, including a partial immolation at the hands of Danielle. Mitchum's bad guy doesn't suffer nearly enough for what he's put the Bowmans through.<br /><br />Watch 'em both and make your own comparisons, but by all means see this one first!<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.3) Cape Fear (1991) - Nick Nolte/Jessica Lange/Robert De Niro/Juliette Lewis/Joe Don Baker/Robert Mitchum/Gregory Peck/Martin Balsam/Fred Thompsonoriginal, Sam shoots Cady in the shoulder and the wounded Max quietly lays there while Sam crows that he's going back to jail for life.

B0049GYXDG|5.0|Bravo, Disney! After reading the glowing reviews of this highly underrated Disney Classic, I finally picked up a copy today. Thinking I would hit 'Play' and do some work while it provided some background noise, I found myself glued to the screen for the entire film. The Blu-ray edition is nothing short of a miracle; pristine from beginning to end! Grab your copy before it goes back into the vault. You won't be disappointed.

The CGI environment is highly impressive from a technical standpoint (resolution & detail, textures, color, and some originality)<br /><br />2.  Originality, at best, is a 3 out of 5.  Movie buffs like myself will quickly see merit in this observation even if they don't like it.  James Cameron actually thought that he Could buy all of us off by dressing up old themes, characters, plots, and geography.  Here's the foundation of the movie:  we're in a much distant future (how do we know that, well to date we have never discovered life in or near our galaxy therefore we would've had to travel at least out of our solar system to find a Pandora (at present we barely have the expertise to get to Mars with 3 or 4 people, let alone a whole military company beyond our solar system)...also, the technology and size of our spaceships suggests that we are at least a century into the future), yet we find an alien race of people living in an equivalent of our Amazon jungle, using bows and arrows!!!, heavy facial features of South American Indians, including dress, and finally, jungle beasts that are no more than dressed up horses, cats of the jungle, rhinos (with a hammer head snout), and dogs...and this is supposed to be an alien planet.  Did anyone notice that the Marines' cargo loaders (the robot-like machines at headquarters) look almost identical in concept to the cargo loaders in Aliens (not to mention having Aliens star Sigourney Weaver as one of the main characters)? And what about this \\"UnObtanium\\"?  Guess what?  Thats already been used too!  Remember the movie The Core?  Guess what the mineral was that Delroy Lindo's character used in his mining vessel to bore holes thru the Earth's Surface...UNOBTANIUM!!!  I've seen more originality at the bottom of our oceans!<br /><br />3.  Plot, is a solid 1 out 5!  This plot is so tired that Cameron should be made to refund our money!  Dances With Wolves has already been mentioned, but I also see Medicine Man (where Sean Connery helped battled the pharmaceutical giant that wanted to destroy the native's forest homeland for their greed and monetary purposes), and what about Thunder Heart starring Val Kilmer?  Guess what the plot of that movie was...Val is half White and half Indian, he's an FBI agent who's sent to the native's land to investigate a murder...bottom line is that he finds out that the underlying story is a GOVERNMENT SPONSORED PLAN TO \\"STRIP MINE URANIUM FROM THE RESERVATION...Val then decides to turncoat and help his people fight the government.  Hey, this is a bunch of crap for a movie that made close to 3 billion dollars, eh?  Others have also mentioned The Last Samurai (which I absolutely hated) in having this White guy come in and save the day by learning someone's culture and fighting prowess in the blink of an eye in order to save them.<br /><br />4.  Subliminal messages.  As a person of color, I thought it very disturbing that virtually the entire \\"human cast\\" were all white!  Every position of authority, influence and intelligence were all white, with the exception of the India\\"n\\" scientist.  All in all, I counted one Latino-Michelle Rodriguez\\", one person from India-Dileep Rao, one African American (which we could see, and had a line)-Scott Lawrence, and one Asian actress that was an operator at headquarters.  The rest of the diversed cast were painted up to be the Na'vi.  So what message are you subliminally communicating Cameron, that centuries in the future White America is still in charge of everything, that they are the predominant race from Earth, or that you had to satisfy diversity requirements, but to show your resentment you made sure they were undetectable.  And because this movie was shown worldwide I do not believe it is a petty concern.  It seems James Cameron and the studios are quite fine with accepting money from the world's people but will do nothing torespect them as a paid and invited audience!!!<br /><br />Conclusion.  After being a huge James Cameron fan (I own, among Avatar, Titanic, T1 & T2, 3 of the 4 Alien DVDs, and absolutely loved Abyss), I am sorely disappointed in this movie.  I think he has insulted the intelligence of pure movie buffs, offended me personally with his casting choices, and overall has not created ANY desire in me to see his Avatar sequels.ited audience!!!

B0046ON1G6|5.0|Few motion picture remakes are as good as the film they're based upon. Director Martin Scorsese's 1991 version of CAPE FEAR is a rare example of a reworking that actually exceeds the original. Here's why:<br /><br />1.) Bernard Herrmann's glorious score is powerfully enervating in Dolby stereo.<br /><br />2.) The De Niro Max Cady has better reasons to torment Sam Bowden, an attorney who betrayed and helped convict his own client (Cady) by holding back exculpatory evidence. In the original version, Bowden's eyewitness testimony at Cady's assault trial helps to procure a \\"guilty\\" verdict. While stewing in jail, Cady convinces himself that Bowden is solely responsible for his eight-year prison term, rather than his own wrongful behavior. It's unsustainable illogic, thus a poor reason for revenge.<br /><br />3.) The family dynamic. In the '91 film, daughter Danielle is rebellious to both parents and even welcomes Cady's attention, to a point. In the earlier work, daughter Nancy is a good child who is simply terrified of her stalker. Nick Nolte's Sam is more 3-dimensional than Greg Peck's wooden lawyer; he's also a heel who cheated on his wife. The original movie has no hint of infidelity. Leigh Bowden (Lange) isn't a complete innocent, either. She's been psychologically torturing husband Sam over his indiscretion for some time now.<br /><br />4.) Max Cady himself. Robert De Niro plays him as a genuinely ferocious demon, while Robert Mitchum is sinister but far more low key. De Niro drew upon early efforts with director Roger Corman for the coarse mountain-accented Max. In Corman's [[ASIN:B000SK5ZFC BLOODY MAMA]] (1970), he was Ma Barker's psychotic son, Lloyd.<br /><br />5.) Superior special effects in Scorsese's picture make the climactic stormy river sequence a nerve-shattering experience, especially on the big screen. The freedom to depict graphic violence also means the newer film packs a more powerful punch.<br /><br />6) The finale. De Niro's demise is unforgettable; perhaps his best screen moment. In the original, Sam shoots Cady in the shoulder and the wounded Max quietly lays there while Sam crows that he's going back to jail for life. By contrast, the '91 Max gets everything that's coming to him, including a partial immolation at the hands of Danielle. Mitchum's bad guy doesn't suffer nearly enough for what he's put the Bowmans through.<br /><br />Watch 'em both and make your own comparisons, but by all means see this one first!<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.3) Cape Fear (1991) - Nick Nolte/Jessica Lange/Robert De Niro/Juliette Lewis/Joe Don Baker/Robert Mitchum/Gregory Peck/Martin Balsam/Fred Thompsonle; perhaps his best screen moment.

B0041KKYEM|3.0|spoiler warning :<br /><br />that ending sucks, truly sucks.<br /><br />... with an abdominal wound like that, a ballerina manages to dance the entire black swan routine and the follow-up finale before she collapses from pain, or starts to bleed profusely, never mind expire because of a loss of blood?  I mean come now !!<br /><br />A far more realistic ending would have seen out a fight between her and her imaginary rival only to find, at the end of her dancing tour de force, that it was her domineering mother she had stabbed to death.
B000002P74|5.0|In just a few months, I've become a fan of Lynyrd Skynyrd. Ever since their first album, I've come to admire one of the most masterful bands of Southern rock. Second Helping helps me admire them even more. Along with Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd, this one showcases why Skynyrd are rock 'n' roll legends.<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Sweet Home Alabama - I'll have to admit, I think that this song is a bit overrated. I've heard it way too many times in movies, TV shows, and commercials. It's a good song, but I've grown tired of it a few years ago.<br /><br />I Need You - This is by far my favorite song on Second Helping. It has a very mellow blues style, complete with beautiful-sounding guitar and bass. One of Skynyrd's greatest, yet sadly one of their most underrated.<br /><br />Don't Ask Me No Questions - This one is nice, but the music seems a bit off. The lyrics are great, though.<br /><br />Workin' For MCA - This is a fun song right here. Makes me want to hear it while driving down a very long road.<br /><br />The Ballad of Curtis Loew - My second favorite. It tells a story of a young boy who enjoys watching and listening an old African-American man playing guitar for him all day. When Curtis dies, the boy wishes that the man was well-known for his music. This is sort of like a homage to the blues, and it sounds brilliant from beginning to end.<br /><br />Swamp Music - This one is also fun to listen to. The lyrics are a bit repetitive, but who cares?<br /><br />The Needle and the Spoon - My third favorite. I wonder why this song isn't so well-known? Oh, well.<br /><br />Call Me the Breeze - Not very good. Not to say that it's bad, but it doesn't sound very catchy. The brass instruments didn't help, either.<br /><br />BONUS TRACKS:<br />Don't Ask Me No Questions - There are a few differences here and there, but otherwise both songs sound the same.<br /><br />Was I Right or Wrong - A wonderful song that should have been on this album. Yet another favorite of mine.<br /><br />Take Your Time - Why does the bass sound like the theme to Sesame Street? Oh, well. A good song nonetheless.<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Grade: 9.8/10the bass sound like the theme to Sesame Street? Oh, well.

B0041KKYDI|2.0|I'm going to go ahead and say it, there just isn't enough here to fill the short 90 minute run time.    There is so little plot, that half of the movie is filled with ill-fitting memories and dream sequences. The dream sequences are very haunting and well done. Especially the imagery of the dark figure, the protagonist on the outside looking in... But it became tedious rather quickly.    Danny Boyle did great, I don't think anyone could have done it better... And I still think this is a good movie and agree with the positives by early reviewers. Would have made an incredibly compelling short. But you can't fill seats with shorts.    ... Worth a watch. But be sure not to bring one, or you'll end up checking it frequently.
B000MV8XPG|4.0|It's durable plastic - dirt can be washed off & won't grind the wheels. Watch the arm-lock though - if the arm is up & the lock is released, the arm drops quickly & the lock snaps back. After a pinch - they'll hold their fingers back.    Helpful hint...the silver caps that go on the end of the axles...put the cap on concrete floor, the axle in the cap & hit with hammer straight on. Then goes the wheel, the black tube, through the base, black tube, wheel & then silver cap. Turn it over so the loose cap is on the floor, have someone hold the contraption for you while you hit the cap on the other end.    Assembly aside, my 3-year old nephew LOVED this toy. Because it will hold up to 75 lbs, it should last him a few years - better than the ones that only hold up to 45 lbs. When he saw it he said \\"I've been thinking about an excavator all day! This is just what I wanted!\\" We spent the rest of the afternoon digging up \\"buried pirate treasure\\" in the yard. Well worth the price.
1881273156|5.0|This book was an eye-opener for me. Realizing that I can make my significant other feel loved just by paying attention to the way he loves me was a great thing. Eventually it made me feel great to express that love.  This book really helped me see things from a different perspective.  Although it is basically common sense, sometimes it takes someone shedding light on the truth to be able to get a grasp of such a simple concept.  I would really like to read some of Dr. Chapman's other books, especially those that are a \\"Five Love Languages\\" book.  If I could ask Dr. Chapman something, I would ask him what made him want to share all of this with the world and help everyone with their relationships? A+ from me.<br /><br />Michal
B001LRJH0U|4.0|I have a deep fascination with cinema dealing with the Wild West. From the traditional outlaw drama Tombstone to the dark gritty revisionist HBO series Deadwood, it's always a pleasure to watch. Deadwood, as well as The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, remain my personal favorites in this particular genre. I don't consider Appaloosa to be one of my favorites, but that doesn't automatically mean that the movie is a failure. It has some flaws, but it also has some very wonderful things about it. First off, I will say that Jeremy Irons seems a bit miscast as the main villain. He's a good actor, but he tries very hard to talk with a western accent. Instead, he ultimately sounds like an actor who's trying very hard to hide his British accent. Renee Zellweger is a bit more appropriate for her respective role, but she still looks a bit out of place in the movie.<br /><br />But with that said, this is a very good traditional western. The sets, the music, the cinematography, all of it is very conservative when compared to Deadwood. The dialogue is a bit more modern, though there's hardly any profanity in the entire film. Several cliches are present, but they're well-executed with the strong dialogue (credit goes to Ed Harris and Robert Knott). Finally, both Harris and Mortensen give very nice performances as two lawmen who take complete control of the small town of Appaloosa. It's a very well-made Western, but if you're looking nonstop action instead of character development and interesting dialogue, then I think you should try 3:10 to Yuma instead of Appaloosa.<br /><br />Grade: 7.9/10

B00127RAJY|4.0|I actually am really enjoying this DVD workout. I have done my share of DVD workouts (mostly in the winter because it's so cold to get outside to run or even get in my cold car and get to the gym). This workout is a nice change. I was getting bored with previous DVD workouts. So far, this has kept my attention. I like that you have 3 different workout options. I felt like the first level was not intense enough, but it was nice to have the option of going up a level as soon as I felt ready. Jillian Michaels was a great workout trainer on the DVD. She kept up the words on encouragement and was \\"real\\" about getting results. The only concern I have is whether a 20 minute workout is sufficient enough when my boyd is already used to 45-60 min workouts. I have lost 3 lbs. in two weeks...which was nice; I was doing this mostly to stay toned and active, the drop in weight was a nice surprise :) Overall...I am happy with this DVD.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|*SPOILER ALERT*<br />There are times when you want a movie that is not only a true story but one you know has a fabulous ending without disaster involved. Perfect film when you need something to lift you up.<br />I admit, I looked up Secretariat's story online and wanted to know his history BEFORE watching the movie because I didn't want to see the horse die, get sick or be hurt during the film.  I had just dumped a movie earlier in the day after the first 45 seconds due to a serial killer about to set a kitten up to be tortured and killed(Diane Lane ironically in that movie also).<br />I was happy to know \\"Big Red\\" lived a long life and won the triple crown pushing out in front of the other horses and winning by more then 31 lengths.  Amazing.<br />I was all warm and fuzzy knowing that his owner loved him and he wasn't mistreated a day in his life.  He sired 600 foals after his racing days were over then sadly had to be put down after an illness that was incurable.  He was a wonderful horse with a great family who loved him. (Film does not go into his death later in life)<br />Diane Lane is one of my favorites and as always did a terrific job.  When you want a true story and you need a classic feel good flick, this is the one.

1439190275|5.0|I've been morbidly obese for about 15 yrs. My last visit to the doctor was the day after returning from Vegas after I became sick from food poisoning last year. I had been there on vacation a week and the last 2 days I was violently ill. So, my doctor said your weight is 364 lbs. I then told that it was so \\"low\\" because I'd not had any food for 3 days and was constantly--well you know--. Anyway, 12 weeks ago I decided to try the Atkins Plan. The first phase was rough because not only did I stop all the sugar foods etc., but I quit drinking booze. 10 days past as I slowly felt this surge of energy that I'd not felt in decades. I was becoming INSPIRED! I added an eclipcycle machine to my home office and started a morning 5 minute workout with this machine on level 1). After 4 days I doubled the time because I suddenly had an enormous amount of energy far beyond what I'd developed at the 10 day Diet Plan. THEN shortly after I DOUBLED the time again and set the machine at level-3. I've been on PHASE 2 of the Atkins Plan for 11 weeks now, have not missed ONE SINGLE DAY of my exercise routine. and just weighed in at Group Health and it was, are you ready for this: 329 lbs! Folks this \\"shedding\\" off of that terrible ugly body fat and the thinning of my facial features has ALREADY turned heads with my customers and friends that had not seen me in a few months. My family and friends on FACEBOOK are experiencing this daily lifestyle change with me by reading my daily posts and seeing pictures. Now instead of sleeping until I MUST get up at 7:50AM, I automatically awake at 6:AM, make my excellent choice of breakfast, take my daily vitamins, drink a couple glasses of water and began and COMPLETE my exercise routine. I'm CEO of Integrity Auto Body LLC, and I've changed the hours of business operation back an hour. Last month was the most profitable month in 10 yrs at that location. I KNOW it's the smart choices I've made to try this Atkins Plan, stick with it, and folks, I swearto you, EVERY DAY IS BETTER IN EVERY WAY! Robert Appleton :-)

I cannot and will not spend money on a blu ray set of these that do not contain the unaltered versions,it is against my priciple and i stand by that.  To make mathers worse...he's about to spend time and money on a 3D release again in theatres.....omg man,what you thinkin?  restore the originals at best possible,release them on blu ray along with the other versions,..your vision,and ill fork out the cash right now!  untill then i'll stick to my PAL versions (576 lines)( non-anamorphic) of the unaltered dvd releases,they dont look that great but they are the best out there since you get about 96 lines extra resolution compared to the NTSC 480 if i'm correct here.  If Lucas continues to be stubborn like this he gonna get a lot of fans against him tbh,the outcry is just incredible,there's isnt a forum out there that is not discussing this,...George...please man,come to peace with your fans and make us all happy,thank you
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|In 1970 Beatle music was everywhere and we thought it would never end,it did though and the record player I had then could not do justice to the complexity of the actual recording. Hearing it now on cd was a rediscovery and confirms the Beatles place in rock history!
B0028DRGDQ|5.0|First of all ill explain a few things:  I stumbled upon the dubbed version of this film by accident which i found the dubbing completely horrible. About 10 minutes into it i gave up and went on to search for it's original language with subtitles.  I found me a copy and saw it was a film shot in my home country's language of Spanish which was a big bonus for me.  Now i never seen Quarantine before and although i learned that Q was the American remake i still decided to watch REC first.    Let me say that there was prolly a few boring moments in the first 10 or 15 minutes of the film but after that i was locked and glued to my TV. Ive seen many horror films since the 60s and this one blew me the heck away!  Aside from the normal beginning there was not one single minute of boring or terror filled moments. The eerie and frightening atmosphere of the surroundings had a real feeling especially with the amateur camera work.   You know the rest if you read the other reviews.    From reading the reviews i suspect that most people who submitted a bad or unsatisfied low rating review have watched this film dubbed or at least with subtitles.  Now i have watched all versions and the dubbed version is absolutely horrible! It really kills this film period.  For those who didn't like watching it subtitles then you have a legit beef but there is nothing compared to this unless you understand Spanish. It really adds a whole new light to the film since reading subtitles (which isn't really that bad) is still slightly distraction and still not very accurate in translation.    Now we move on to the remake Quarantine.  Being a heavy movie fanatic for decades i can honestly say that they should of never made a remake and rather should of made a better dubbed version with the sounds and everything better emulated.  Now Quarantine was great but compared to REC it doesn't even come close. Did they really have to remake it almost shot by shot (especially with the same actors we always see becomes a huge bore)?  This is why i believe some rate down this film and say either Quarantine was better or the same since the remake is in English with no horrible dubbing to subtitles to read.    REC1 coupled with REC2 is like 28 days later, blair witch and paranormal activity with a touch of The Exorcist combined.    Now in my top 10 all time favorites.

B000JMLFLW|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is one of the books I turn to when I need a break from my real life. I love getting caught up with the Bennett family. There's just something about the book...<br />The real reason I'm writing this review is not to dwell on the wonderfulness that is Pride and Prejudice, but to note my slight distraction by the formatting. There were certain spots where lines broke oddly, and strange words that were written in all capital letters. It was often enough to be slightly distracting, but still a good book and a wonderful read (if that sort of thing doesn't bother you too much).
B0030E1XJU|5.0|My son who is 4 1/2 got the whole action links set for christmas.  Initially he needed help setting up the whole set,  but once that happened and he saw all of it work in action, he is able to set it all up by himself now.  He is the kind of kid though who can spend a lot of time working puzzles by himself, lincoln logs, and loves anything cars or trains.  He has no interested in action hero type toys so this set was something different other than cars or trains that entertains him a lot. My nephew who is 8 also had a great time playing with it. I would recomend it for any kid who loves toy story 3 , between ages 4 - 9.

Because of new technology, this genre of music changes constantly. This album is a blast - it's a party on its own! I enjoy it so much - always makes me want to dance or air drum! This album is incredible... very fast, upbeat, crazy, and totally intoxicating!
0307269981|2.0|It is rare that I have trouble finishing a book, but The Girl Who Played With Fire was certainly hard to slog through.  I loved The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo - I found it fun and engaging, and the characters and plot kept me turning the pages.  The snappy storytelling and glimpses inside what made the characters tick sucked me in, and although it was far-fetched (as many crime books are), it was still believable.<br /><br />Well, in this book, Larsson threw any pretense of this book taking place in the real world right out the window.  It's hard to know where to start - with the laughable Supergirl persona that Larsson gave Salander this time around, with the fact that there were so many unnecessary side characters that I stopped trying to keep them straight about two-thirds of the way through the book, with the fact that there is no possible way that Salander could \\"disappear\\" right beneath the authorities' noses simply by stealing someone else's identity, donning a wig, and getting breast implants.  Add to that a \\"twist\\" so cliched that a certain line from a certain science fiction movie immediately popped into my head when the \\"twist\\" about the link between Salander and the case was revealed, and I really can't recommend much about this book.<br /><br />What I did like was the continuation of the story with Lisbeth's original guardian and the continued character development of Blomkvist.  It's too bad that an otherwise completely ludicrous plot and Lisbeth's transformation into a Mary Sue ruined these elements for me.
B0007DAZW8|5.0|This is definitely my favorite electronica album and it's definitely in my top 10 favorite albums of all time!<br />It's awesome to hear the difference between the 3 DP albums and their progression to this album.<br />They have come a very long way - the musical material definitely sounds more complicated, richer, and much more energetic than the previous two albums. The music is so fun, interesting, futuristic, and terribly exciting. I listen to this album constantly. This album made me attracted to robots.
B004B32500|4.0|It was a pleasant surprise to find out Severin has released \\"Sante Sangre\\" in a region 1 DVD.  Even more pleasantly surprised was I when watching the film with my wife (after many years since my first viewing).  The transfer by Severin is very clean and free of noticeable damage, and reel changes are seamless! I imagine this transfer is the best yet, altho I cannot compare it to the numerous European DVD releases.<br /><br />  As it stands, \\"Sante\\" is a very entertaining and interesting movie, which never stagnates even in its slower parts. I feel \\"Sante Sangre\\" is Jodorowski's most cohesive and tangible film.  \\"Holy Mountain\\" and \\"El Topo\\" (also made by Jodorowski) are superb films, and are best described as surreal and mystical, whereas \\"Sante Sangre\\" possesses a linear plot and is less surreal than his earlier mentioned works. Less surreal to a small degree of course, for we are talking about Jodorowski here!<br />Like most directors, Jodorowski remains in his comfort zone, as we see many images rehashed from his previous works: Mimes, exploitative use of the physically disabled for shock value, tarot imagery, drug use, and also open criticism towards organized religion. Creative repitition is nothing new for directors and writers, especially when it comes to Hollywood.  LOL, has Brian De Palma made one film that is truly unique?  =) doubtful.<br /><br /> These \\"parlor tricks\\" Alejandro uses so freely, while very commonplace in the genre, never detract from his personal skill with making a film, and should not be confused with an inability to deliver a real story. What good film doesn't offend and push the limits of the viewer's psyche?<br />I recommend \\"Sante Sangre\\" as a great beginner to Jodorowski's somewhat short film canon, or as something new for those who have seen \\"Holy Mountain\\" or \\"El Topo\\".<br /><br />If you have an open mind for film, I highly recommend this...
B000059MEK|5.0|I am crazy in love with this album. Each song is very different and stands alone, but the album is very cohesive. Each song has its perfect place and it makes sense. This album is very funky, jazzy, simple, beautiful and very enthusiastic! It's certainly lighter and more reminiscent than the other two DP albums and I totally love each song. It's excellent driving music!! Everyone who enjoys this album should see Interstella 5555.

Downside of this books is that the font size of the leters in the book is little small for people with bad eyesight.  But I love it, and it is no problem with it.

B003TSEL7S|4.0|I have read all the Percy Jackson novels, and the Red Pyramid and, out of all the books I have read by Rick Riodan, I have to say that this is my favourite. The only problem that I had with The Lost Hero is that it was not long enoulf, and I would have liked it better if rick gave more insight on Percy and if the next book is starring Percy Jackson, as everyone is predicting, then I think there should be at least some info on Jason's doing (which i'm sure there will be). Over all a great book ;) 4 stars.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I see now that I have to hold on to my THX laserdisc original versions a whole lot longer.     I will absolutely, unequivocably, NOT buy this. It really irks me that George Lucas shows such flagrant disrespect not only to fans of the films, but to the films themselves. In the interest of brevity, let me put it simply: RELEASE THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS! William Peter Blatty and William Friedkin did it right with The Exorcist Blu-Ray: they treated the original 1973 version and the 2000 expanded edition as seperate entities, and gave each a lavish and respectful co-release in one, awesome package. That way, Mr Lucas, you present your updated version, while still honoring and respecting the hallowed place the original films hold in the hearts and imagination of a generation. Until then...NO SALE.

Her face is definitely a familiar one to all of us and maybe that's what makes it feel like she's been acting for so long. She's a natural.<br /><br />Much like musicians Eminem and 50 Cent did, Aguilera chooses to play a character close to home for her big screen debut; you guessed it - an aspiring singer / dancer.<br /><br />She's small-town girl Ali, and ups and leaves with her life savings to head to Los Angles to make it big. When she arrives, she's a little overwhelmed by the big city rush, but soon enough finds herself in a dark and tiny club called Burlesque. She enters just in time to see Cher's character Tess, performing on stage. Naturally, she's captivated, and so are we: Cher's still got it, folks.<br /><br />Tess owns the club, and is on the verge of losing it to a rich L.A. playboy, Marcus (Eric Dane). Dane plays Marcus as nice a villain as he can be, and villain or not - I was forced into liking the character. Dane is a blast, and I look forward to seeing him in more things.<br /><br />Tess's ex-husband and co-owner Vince (Peter Gallagher) is on Marcus's side, and wants her to sell. Tess has too many memories, and buried dreams rooted in her little club though, and to sell it would be to sell her soul. But when money isn't exactly flowing in, whatever is she to do?<br /><br />Luckily, Ali is smitten with Burlesque, and is determined to get a job there. After she is told to come back and audition by Tess and her assistant, Sean (Stanley Tucci); there's a nice little moment where Ali decides to first pick up a tray and start waitressing right there on the spot. This catches Tess's attention and more importantly this early on in the story, the attention of the bar tender, Jack (Cam Gigandent).<br /><br />After an unfortunate incident, Ali finds herself homeless with nowhere to go. So she shacks up with Jack, who is a safe fix because she works with him, and he has a fianc&eacute;. I enjoyed these scenes a lot, as Cam and Christina had amazing chemistry, and it was a lot of fun to see their feelings for one another boiling, with the conflict of Jack's fianc&eacute;, keeping them from acting on them.<br /><br />And of course, we have the witch-character that is the club's best entertainer under Tess, until Ali comes along. Kristen Bell, plays the snarky alcoholic Nikki, to a T; which is due much praise, as we all know what a sweetheart she can be.<br /><br />I've given you a lot with the characters alone, and hopefully that's enough. You can see how they will interact with one another and move the story forward. The plot and story arks we've seen a million times before, but the actors all do their jobs effortlessly, and we get some breaks from the melodrama by big musical scores that were put together quite nicely.<br /><br />In addition to her great acting performance, Christina Aguilera delivers some jaw dropping dance moves and her voice sounds only better in digital surround sound.<br /><br />Burlesque probably should have been an R-rated film, with more adult driven dialogue and some nudity; something one would expect to find in a club called `Burlesque'. But it does about as good as can be expected with a PG - 13.where Ali decides to first pick up a tray and start waitressing right there on the spot.

0307595579|5.0|I came across these books on accident, but am so happy that I did! Once I opened the first one, I could not put them down. The best thing about these books is there is more than one story and character development in each one with Miss Salander as the common denominator. Her character is so raw from her attire to her blatant violence. I have always been too outspoken and angry to be a lady, and I love empowerment of a character that does not conform to society.
B004D7GU3C|5.0|I jjust love this album i felt it was wondeerfully created and produced and it just explores the ebst of Ricky in a variety of worlds. Another brilliant thing about this album is that he's produced sooo many different variations of music as well as his now traditional Enlgish and Spanish and i think Ricky has definetly still got some flame in him! If you've never heard of him or keen to get back into his music then definetly buy this album. Its...well there's soo many words that i could use to describe this album but none best sum it up so what im going to say it is it's Ricky!!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I really, really enjoyed the view of the world from little Jack's eyes.  The story compels you to keep reading and reading.

I wasn't able to give the gift immediately but finally presented it in mid-January.  I just discovered that the book was defective...I guess the recipient didn't want to hurt my feelings by letting me know right away.  It's too late to return it, but I want you to be aware of it.  There were pages missing, pages out of order and the book restarted again in the middle.

B001QOGYFO|3.0|Amputation is the least of the worries as Kate Beckinsale stars as Carrie Stetko, a U.S. marshal with trust issues - a former partner backstabbed her - who is stationed in Antarctica and nearing her final departure date.  That is, until someone spots a human popsicle in a remote location.  A motley crew of contractors - including Tom Skerritt as a doctor, Alex O'Loughlin and Columbus Short as pilots - get tossed together in order to solve the mysterious death, dodge an ice-axe-wielding killer, and wrap it up in a nice, shiny bow before the last plane leaves and strands the group before a deadly winter storm hits.<br /><br />Overall, the tension just isn't palpable.  The only time my heart rate raced was the result of Beckinsale's shower scene, not the danger during a whiteout or guideline following action sequences, and the only shivering that occurred was because easily deduced foreshadowing (if you can't figure out who the bad guys are in the film, you're not trying) made the killer as predictable as in an Abraham Lincoln biography.  Make no mistake, Beckinsale's the primary reason to watch this film, because the product is relatively bland, but she's dressed up like Ralphie's little brother Randy in Christmas Story the entire film, and taking her out of those clothes would be even more improbable than keeping her in them.  Dilemma.<br /><br />I'd give the film an A for effort, considering this subgenre of suspense (i.e. blizzards) really has only been attempted a handful of times before, but effort is not enough, and at no time was the action intense or the storyline completely engaging.  For whatever reason - call it Anglo-inspired culture, language, and legends - but the attempted claustrophobic effect was not as successful as that of a dark cave, murky water, or even pitch-black openness.<br /><br />Probably the best aspect of this movie was the beautiful display of scenery available at the South Pole; some of the mountainous landscape is jaw-dropping.<br /><br />Jason Elin
1439152780|5.0|A wonderful book! The best one I've read in a very long time. Love all the Kate Morton books...but, this is the best!
B00428ZRFE|3.0|I LOVE RIHANNA let me just start with that. But the title of this album is what....\\"LOUD\\". I thought it would be loud! From her singles \\"Only Girl in the World\\" and \\"S&M\\" I thought the album would sound like a dance club type album. Boy was I wrong! For the title the way it sounded it sure does have alot of ballets!     1. S&M - I love it! The bass is kicking! Type of song that makes u feel sexy!  2. \\"Whats My Name\\"- I love Drake but this song really didnt fit him. I think they had to use him for promotional reasons. All the kids love the song so its a great commerical song for the album  3. \\"Cheers\\" - I have to say I like this song because every person that is ages 21-30 has been thro the stage of drinking and partying then feeling like crap in the morning. This song is good because we all (over 21) can relate to it  4. \\"Fading\\"- This is where I start to fall asleep! This is a great song tho! Its about moving on from a lover that you have drifted part from. Its a sweet song but again...the album is called \\"Loud\\" not \\"Lullabies\\"  5. \\"Only Girl in the World\\"- LOVE LOVE LOVE! Who ever her rep is that told her to release this song as her 1st single needs a promotion cuz I was def was sold as soon as I heard this! Bass is hott and I just want to replay over and over!  6. \\"California King Bed\\" I can see why this song made the album. Even though its a slow song, it really pulls its weight for being on the \\"Loud\\" album. Her vocals have improved since 2005 and she belts out her notes which is amazing and is quite proud! Also it as a wicked electric guitar solo which is....u guessed it...\\"Loud\\"  7. \\"Mandown\\"- well I THOUGHT this was a remake from a Reggae song that was either from the 80s or the 90s. To my surprise...its not! Seriously I am very surprised! I love this song and thought she sang it well and played a character very well to sing the song. Well done!  8. \\"Raining Men\\" - I hate this song...I can say it any other way. It songs like a cheap version of Beyonce's \\"Diva' I was very disappointed as a fan of Rihanna. Its a fun song to listen to when ur riding in the car to the club with her friends but other then that...boooooo!  9. \\"Complicated\\"- It didnt grab my attention in the very beginning like the other songs. After listening to the very boring chours in the beginning (which was a bad move) her voice is very powerful. I love her range now. Whoever is her vocal coach should coach jennifer Lopez. Rihanna songs amazing now.   10. \\"Skin\\" - Honestly....I fell asleep on this song. I understand she wanted to make a sexy song but....zzzzzzz...wait! WHAT WAS A TALKING ABOUT?!  11. \\"Love the Way You Lie II\\" I love this version better then the 1st I must say. Eminem is just crazy I'm sorry. I never liked his songs because they were just either about how he hates his mom or killing his wife. Doesnt appeal to me. But if he just has a 2 min verse then hey I'll take it!
0887306667|4.0|This is the first book I have read by Al Ries and Jack Trout.  I am fairly new to marketing and have heard and seen that there are several more books out there by the two authors regarding marketing strategies.  This book, The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing, was a straight to the point easy read book.  The 2 authors waste no time in defining their 22 different laws and then stating quick strategies to put the laws to work.  No detailed plans, but just quick tactical pointers to help put marketing strategies in motion.  Throughout the entire book the 2 authors give example after example of prominent companies around the world that have practiced these laws and companies that have violated these 22 laws as well.  Quick example  Law #1- The Law of Leadership.   The 2 questions below can demonstrate the law of leadership.  1. Who was the first person to fly the Atlantic Ocean?  It was Charles Lindbergh.  2. Who was the second person to fly the Atlantic Ocean?  This question isn't as easy.  The law is that it is better to be first than it is to be better.  It then gives several examples of companies that were in a market first, and therefore more successful, than companies that found an existing market and then tried to compete within that same market.    The book continues on with examples like the one above, and starts using well known companies past marketing programs.  Any reader, even ones that are not in marketing, will recognize the company's strategies within the examples.    I enjoyed the book and look forward to reading more books written by Ries and Trout.
1416550550|2.0|I think this could have been a much better read with a good deal of editing. The descriptive nature of every thought, detail, emotion, movement etc. was so overdone that it came at the expense of the character development. It was as if the author might believe her readers were be incapable of creating the images in their head, let alone connecting the dots and included so much descriptive prose to ensure some level of safety. Also as one reader noted, the use deus ex machina really left me feeling cheated. I think the author tried to string out mystery for too long. It was evident by the middle of the book what had happened. And the tea! There was so much tea being served in the book, I felt awash in it!

B0042U94UQ|5.0|from the previews and ads for this movie- i thought that it was going to be worthless , crass, and child-ISH.   much to my delight and surprise--the movie was adorable.   simple plot-  bad guy softens to kindness---great tho simple--and ohhhhhhhh . the girls.   the reason i LOVED monsters inc was BOO.  well, this now tops monsters inc b/c of the three little girls: margo, edith and agnes.  they captured the essence of girlhood---and what made this was a success WAS spending most time on the girls---yet carrying on slightly larger plot of \\"super-villian\\".    thank you and bring us another movie with the girls in it!  also, someone please market both of the board books featured in the movie!    loved it! there were only 2 things i thought could have been left out... and they were the \\"poop\\" exclamations and the minions on the copy machine.   loved the rest.  thank you.

0380713802|1.0|I jumped on the Bryson bandwagon after reading \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" a few years back. I loved his self-deprecating humor, his factoids and quirky side-notes, as well as his anecdotal style. I continued on that bandwagon with \\"I'm a Stranger Here Myself,\\" which was laugh-out-loud funny. Since then I've read most of his books, and although my enjoyment of them has varied, I've never been disappointed.<br /><br />Until reading \\"Neither Here nor There.\\" Perhaps my expectations were too high, having traveled in over half the places Bryson details in his travelogue. But \\"details\\" and \\"travelogue\\" are both too kind in their description of this book. From his first whiny, self-centered moments in Norway, Bryson makes it clear that his story will be more about him than about the peoples or places he visits. His chapter on Oslo is a sham, barely even mentioning the city. He spends a good deal of time complaining about lack of beauty in Brussels instead of telling us what the city has to offer instead--though I agree, it's not a pretty city, in general. He makes all the usual comments about Amsterdam's seedy side, but provides little insight into the mindset or history. Frankly, he seems grumpy throughout the book, as though held at gunpoint to meet a contract with his publisher. He's the humorous uncle who shows up at Thanksgiving dinner drunk, and then makes the entire meal uncomfortable with his self-congratulatory humor and lack of manners. He talks about the complete waste that he believes dogs are--and says he would personally shoot poodles. He even has the nerve to compare Belgian spa treatments to Josef Mengele's horrors in WWII concentration camps. Not exactly the most suitable comparison when a few pages later Bryson points out the number of Belgians killed by SS stormtroopers in one particular confrontation.<br /><br />I will continue to read Bryson's work, based on his track record, and on the fact that he can be funny when he's not drunk on his own clever sentences and feigned knowledge of his location. This book, though, is a forgettable almost unforgivable waste of his talents, Europe's richness and intrigue, and my time.nowledge of his location.

031603438X|3.0|Keith has written a book that reminds me of a skipping stone. The stone skips over a big lake, touching down here, and there, but never shows the depth of the lake. I kept hoping the book would show more of the inside workings of the Stones. No luck. Or what it is like out on tour. No luck. Or an in-depth look at his relationships in the band. No luck. The book skips like a stone, and when the stone finally ended its skipping, and the book was over, I was unsatified.

B00402FGE4|5.0|I have loved this high-quality television series (Stargate Universe) since the beginning, and for me it is the best of all of the various Stargate shows.  Season One's Air, and Darkness, and Light, and Time episodes were especially well done.  The diverse cast who inhabit Destiny come together to bring us shows filled with humanity, suspense, adventure, and enough sci-fi action to keep this fan hooked.  My hope is that this series will continue to entertain us with their brilliant cast and their interesting and ever-evolving plots for many more seasons to come.  Hooray for SGU, and well-done MGM!

B0042816YK|4.0|It amazes me that the ones out number any of the other start ratings for this movie or film. I wonder how many of those people who love to leave \\"their\\" revies even read the book prior to viewing the movie. It has two of the most wonderful actors still in the twenty first centry. There is a great story that is told and in it being told you go on a journey that takes you to countries you may never get to visit. It if you watch and really listen can lift your spirit and soul. This person who states we are our own \\"God\\" could not be more \\"WRONG\\" than he or she and thier negative review states. I am married, sharing my life on Valentines day 15yrs with the same person. We have five or with the lil doggies seveon children that we watched the film with. Ages ranging from one to 28. Each of their thoughts of the film were similar to our but they would have rated the film a 3.5 stars. This film though Julia who seeks her Soul & Spirit to be shined upon, would relate to any Male, Female or in between. Honestly rent it prior to buying it. This way you save a little and if then you choose to buy it great. If you still did enjoy it but not enough to add to your collection, at least you can leave a review to help other's attempt to make a move on renting or buying the film. Oh and please those 56 one ratings each used the word Cubin actor, come on that in itself tells you a little something about what their ratings worth holds. Cheers, Peace & Blessings. Please know that though I did not agree with those I speak of in no way do I take away from their right to speak freely. I do however stand on what I said to the \\"one\\" person who said we are our own \\"God\\". That holds no value what so ever. That I do stand by.

B003EV6DBM|3.0|The actors did a good job with what they were given. But I felt that the stories were just not up to the standard of the other recent seasons. The overall arc of the season felt forced, they kept hitting you in the head with it instead of letting it build more subtly.      I do like the new look of the TARDIS. Matt Smith makes a decent if somewhat young doctor. Amy and Rory are well acted but they are not written as interestingly as Rose and Mikey were. I would have liked to have seen him with a non-contemporary era companion this time or even a non-earther.
0596805888|4.0|Disclaimer: I am not a cook or chef.  Nor do I aspire to be one.  I love to eat and have been intrigued by the Food Network but I'd rather stop in at Iron Chef Michael Symon's Lola for lunch than try and recreate his menu.    That said, I am a Geek and there is a significant amount of science and tech in the world of cooking.  The author mixes in a lot of science with the recipes and cooking techniques.  Foodies may skip the science and techies may skip the recipes but that would be a mistake.  Both parts are important.    I like the numerous interviews that are strewn throughout the book.  For example, Potter interviews Cornell prof Brian Wansink about why and what we eat.  Did you know that, according to Wansink, the \\"nutritional gatekeeper\\" (the person in the home who buys and makes the food) controls about 72% of the food their family eats?  Or that people tend to pour 32% more into a short wide glass than a tall skinny glass? There are a lot of interesting tidbits like that throughout the book.  Even former Microsoft CTO Nathan Myhrvold shares his cooking philosophy and techniques.    The book covers all the basics which is important for non-foodie geeks like me.  Potter treats the kitchen and its tools as any other laboratory with instruments.  You want the best, most accurate, most precise instruments in your lab - and in your kitchen.    He then covers the ingredients with sections on taste (what the heck is savory?) and how Flavor = Smell + Taste (Geeks like equations!)  Some parts are like Chemistry lessons with detailed info on heat transfer methods and times for various foods and the reactions of salt, sugar, acids and bases and alcohol.    Every techie book has to include something on gadgets and this book has a Fun with Hardware section.  Of course the hardware is not microprocessors and hard drives but some of the tools and gadgets available for your cooking.  I don't think I will ever use his Cooking in a Dishwasher technique but I might give the Bake a Brownie in an Orange method a try.    As a mathematician, I liked Meg Hourihan's (the co-founder of Blogger.com) attempt at the perfect chocolate chip cookie.  She took about 40 chocolate cookie recipes and averaged the ingredients and instructions.  Some results were weird - 2.04 cups of flour, 0.79 teaspoons of salt and so on.  Her \\"Mean Chocolate Cookie\\" (pun intended) turned out \\"pretty good\\" she said.    Another fun part for me was the algorithm to cut a cake for N people.  Those of us with siblings faced this situation often while growing up.      The book is 400 pages that will interest foodies and techies alike.  And if you happen to be both - this book is really for you.    As for me...Will I make my own Mozzarella Cheese?  Probably not.  But it was interesting to read how I could if I wanted to.  I think I need a snack.
1439152780|2.0|This was one of those books that tried too hard to be fantastic. The premise is good.  The setting is good; I enjoy stories set in World War 2 Britain.  The story, while it has moments of brilliance, isn't that good.  It flips back and forth between 1992 and 1941 in a convoluted twist and never lives up to its potential.  The ending, where everything should finally come together and be revealed is anti-climatic.  I never did connect with any characters.  I simply found myself impatient for the story to be over.  I should have stopped reading, but I kept wanting to give the book the chance to redeem itself.  It never did.
B0006GAO5Y|5.0|This is an awesome movie.  It represents the 1970's in Philadelphia.  Sylvester Stallone is one of the all time greatest actors that there has ever been.  He does an excellent job in this movie.  I love this whole series.  If you have never seen Rocky or Rambo you are missing out on some of the most amazing classics that there are out there.  Watch Rocky now!
0316098337|2.0|I wish I could have given this book more than two stars. The premise - a mother and child held in captivity for years - is certainly great fodder for a gripping story. Unfortunately, the writer chose to use the child to narrate the story and, at least for me, it didn't work. I found myself distracted from the story by watching for inconsistencies in the dialogue and internal discourse. In dialogue, Jack, the child, might say, \\"It hurted.\\" But his internal discourse contained words like \\"besieged\\" -- a word beyond the reach of a five-year-old.  These inconsistencies were so annoying and I got so bogged down by them that I had to put the book down and give it a rest before I could start reading again. I ended up compromising. Rather than tossing the book aside, I read excerpts all the way to the end. What this book lacked was a thorough editing job. I'm surprised that Little Brown released it with all these inconsistencies. Gail Lowe, Author of Former Things

B001J9AQA0|5.0|While and after listening to The Script's self-titled debut album, immense musical influences may have listeners' ears whirling with one name after another.  There is no denying that all of the songs heard through out the record have that FM radio middle of the road feel to it.  And to add to that comparison, the album artwork is very much reminiscent of the illustrations of past legendary rock album covers of the late 1960 and 1970s that had been done by artist Peter Corriston, which speaks for itself, although it was not done by Corriston.<br /><br />But nonetheless, all ten tracks on The Script are distinct and memorable.  But the highlights off the record are the first two singles off the record \\"The Man Who Can't Be Moved\\" and \\"Breakeven\\" which contain lyrics and choruses that may be hard to forget.  In addition to the \\"hits,\\" for this listener, other tracks have their moments and undeniable influence, \\"Rusty Halo\\" is a melodic cross between Sting and The Police or U2 that possibly could have been one of their songs off any one of their 1980s albums, especially with lead vocalist Donny O'Donogue's uncanny vocal resemblance and the rock and reggae concluding chorus.  And beyond past comparisons to recent ones, \\"Talk You Down\\" and \\"Fall For Anything\\" sound similar to The Fray and Coldplay.<br /><br />The Script is a refreshing album and band to listen to more than once because of the melodic collection of songs that they perform and most likely will be remembered after listening to the entire record.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|Damon Medic says, \\"My Fair Lady\\" is a \\"must see\\" for everyone ages 12-100.  Audrey Hepburn is magnificent as Eliza Doolittle. Professor Henry Higgins transforms the common flower girl into a Duchess as part of a bet with Colonel Pickering from India. Eliza has fallen in love with her teacher, Higgins, who is a confirmed bachelor, and is only interested in winning his bet with Pickering.  This causes a rift in the relationship between Higgins and Doolittle.  Eliza becomes a true \\"lady\\", but wonders what is to become of her.  Eventually, Eliza becomes independent and strong at the precise moment that Higgins becomes needy.  The story is progressed by the tension that exists between Higgins and Doolittle.

I recently purchased a MacBook Pro and wanted to view some films in my iTunes Library on the flat screen TV.  I was told by Apple Support that what I needed was a \\"minidisplay port\\".  Checked them out and found the Amazon had the best price.  It works like a charm.  The set up took 2 seconds.  Just plug it into the side of the computer, plug an HDMI cable into that and the other end of the HDMI into the back of the TV, and go.  The picture is clear, the sound is wonderful.  I'd recommend this to anyone.  [[ASIN:B003XCVQ3C moshi MiniDisplay Port to HDMI Adapter with Audio]]
B00003CXA2|3.0|Damon Medic says, \\"Forrest Gump\\" is one strange movie!  In one sense, it makes no sense whatsoever, yet in another sense, it is a very deep movie.  Forrest is a slightly retarded person, who falls in love with Jenny.  Jenny seems to take advantage of Forrest to fulfill her own feeling of desperation.  Forrest, played by Tom Hanks, decides at one point, to start walking.  As he walks, thousands of people follow him.  He has no real reason for walking.  It is just something he decides to do for no particular reason.  Then one day, he decides to stop.  This movie has no real meaning, and rambles from one place to another.  It is not good for family viewing, as it has some risque scenes in it that are not appropriate for younger viewers.  This is one film that is worth missing.    ---Damon Medic

B0034G4OXQ|5.0|Octogenarian Clint Eastwood's Hereafter is an understated but deeply moving meditation on death and how it affects those left behind. Congratulations must go to Eastwood for going above and beyond the conventional to provide a film that is empowering and unforgettable, one of the finest of his career and one of the best of 2010.     It is not a documentary, nor a European art film. It is a Hollywood product through and through but one with a difference. Refusing to cater to an audience that thrives on chaos and gore, Hereafter is a quiet and slow-paced film that treats every character, even the most flawed, with respect as a three-dimensional human being, not as an object used to bring in box office receipts.    Based on a screenplay by Peter Morgan (Frost/Nixon, The Queen), the subject matter deals with death but it is not maudlin in the slightest. Unlike films such as What Dreams May Come and The Lovely Bones, it is a reality-based film without colorful special effects mirroring popular conceptions of what heaven is all about. While some may not agree with its focus on spiritual mediums, Eastwood still allows us to share the pain of those who have lost a loved one and their experience that there is another dimension that transcends our five senses.     Hereafter tells three stories. In the opening sequence, French journalist and TV personality Marie Lelay played by the outstanding French actress Cecile de France, is vacationing in a beach resort in Indonesia with her producer and boyfriend Didier (Thierry Neuvic) when she is caught in a raging tsunami that uproots buildings and trees and sweeps hundreds to their death. She suffers a concussion and has a near-death experience that transports her to a world of light, one that exists outside of space and time where she feels weightless and has visions of others crossing over after the storm.     As a result of her experience, however, she is unable to focus when she returns to work and is compelled to take time off from broadcasting to write a biography of French politician Francois Mitterrand. What she really wants do, however, is to write a book about her near-death visions. She journeys to Europe to meet with the director of a hospice (Marthe Keller) who has documented many cases in which her patients have seen the other side. Her voyage is a lonely one, however, as her boyfriend rejects her experience as fantasy and publishers look askance at a draft of her book about life after death.    In the second story, George Lonegan, played by Matt Damon in one of his best performances, is a blue-collar worker living in San Francisco who has an unusual gift. Like spiritual mediums John Edward and James Van Praagh, he has the ability to make connections with and communicate messages from the dead. George has not done any readings for three years because he says that \\"a life that's all about death is no life at all,\\" and considers his talent to be a curse rather than a gift.      Though his brother Billy (Jay Mohr) keeps pressing him to return to doing readings, George refuses, but finally agrees to do one last reading for a client of his brother. When he is laid off from his job, however, he takes an Italian cooking class and meets Melanie (Bryce Dallas Howard), who hides her pain beneath a bubbly exterior. When she presses him to do a reading, he agrees but it brings back unpleasant memories for both participants and seems to validate all of his fears.     In the third sequence, in one of the most affecting child performances that I can remember, twin brothers Jason (George McLaren) and Marcus (Frankie McLaren) live with their mother, Jackie (Lyndsey Marshal) in a London apartment. Though she loves the boys, she is addicted to drugs and is being monitored by child welfare. Jason is older by twelve minutes and is the most talkative while Marcus is quiet and withdrawn.     When a sudden tragedy takes place, Marcus is sent to a foster home to try and provide a normal upbringing. The boy is obsessed with one thing, however, and that is making contact with the spirit world. In the film's only misstep, he goes to a variety of psychics who are shown as laughable charlatans instead of serious but perhaps flawed practitioners. Undaunted, he keeps up his quest, refusing to give up until he can achieve his goal of communicating with the hereafter.     While we sense that the threads will come together, to say as some critics have done that the stories are pulled together in \\"a silly set of contrived coincidences\\" overlooks one of the key messages of the film, that synchronicity does exist, that we are all connected, and that things happen for a reason. Backed by a serenely beautiful score composed by Eastwood, the film is emotional and had me in tears, yet it is honest emotion that carefully avoids melodrama and sentimentality.     Hereafter is not a perfect film and there are enough critics around to remind us of that. Yet the fact that this film was even made gives me hope that amidst the lunacy of today's world, the sense is growing slowly, in the song of Gordon Bok, that while \\"it's so easy in the cold to feel the darkness of the year, the world indeed may be \\"turning towards the morning\\".
B000JQU1VS|4.0|A lovely little collection of some great Sherlock Holmes stories! I thoroughly enjoyed it. However, any monetary symbol and an occasional word was read as a bunch of garbled symbols. Not a big deal, but it was off-putting enough to not give a full 5 star rating. Then again, it was free, and it was still a great read.

0307474275|4.0|It was a great FICTITIOUS book. The book was very intriguing and though provoking in the sense that you really could begin to doubt certain historic events and wonder whether the catholic church really did cover up some many things. I read the book after I watched the movie and I actually prefer the story that the book portrays, the movie doesn't seem as vivid as the scenes that come across while you're reading. Dan Brown really stirred the pot on conspiracy theories with this movie, however the use of all of the symbols is quite entertaining and you can really see all of the different shapes that are depicted in the book. All in all a great book.
B0013ND30M|5.0|the movie is great  but it's really annoying when you see 14 dollars for this movie one minute, and then a minute later, it jumps to 25  I am not amused to amazon on pricing at the moment  also, the search result for sleeping beauty is still 14 dollars
B0006ZFQNU|5.0|I highly recommend these recordings. The performances are top notch and the recordings, even though made from 1968 through 1975, are very good quality.
B000092T6M|1.0|This DVD does indeed include new scenes, as the description says.  And these scenes are indeed incorporated into the film.  My MAJOR problem is that there is no way to turn this feature off.  There is no way to view the movie as it originally presented when I saw it as a kid.  I don't mind having new scenes incorporated into films, but the option should be just that: an option.  There should be a way to view both the 'new version' and the old.  Most films now have a 'directors cut' option for viewing and will allow to view choose between it or the original theatrical release.  The newest Robin Hood with Russell Crowe springs to mind as an example, as does James Cameron's 'The Abyss' which includes quite a bit of extra footage.<br /><br />It really is a shame that on both releases of this film to DVD the big wigs just couldn't seem to get it together and give fans the DVDs they deserved.  On both DVD releases there are issues with sound and picture quality.  The major gripe with the first release is that it is a 'flipper', which means it must be flipped over part of the way through in order to finish viewing the film.  The newer release took care of this problem, but inability to view as it was originally released, combined with the still poor sound and picture quality make for a great deal of disappointment in viewing.<br /><br />This is a great movie, it should not be receiving such sub standard handling when being offered on DVD.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|It's loaded with special features, the digital copy works spectacular, and there are excellent easter eggs for the game of the same name.  It shipped safely and securely and I felt like I reached into heaven when I opened the packaging.  The movie is great if you didn't get the chance to see it in theaters.  If you like videogames, girls, comics, and memorable dialogue this one is definitely a keeper.
1599218011|5.0|first of all, my opology for not so perfect english, it's my second lunguage.  but i will do my best to say my opinion about this book.  WE NEED THIS BOOK, i agree, there is not much new info,nothing , that you can't find on a google, it's very similar to \\"the kind diet\\" by Alicia Silverstone (that book is the reason we start eating healthy)about year ago.  but, unless you aware of this lifestyle, and it's not a diet, it's a lifestyle,you don't know.  all my life here in america, i was thinking walmart , is perfect place to shop for everything, it's cheap, you don't have to go to many stores, just go to superwalmart, get everything you need, done.  after reading Alicia's book, everything change, i avoid walmart like plague, most all food there, loaded with white sugar, hormones, all kind a chimicals etc,.  Kris is delivering message to all of us, who is not aware of what we eating, what we feed our kids.  everybody need to read this book, WE NEED MORE BOOKS LIKE THIS, TIME TO WAKE UP AMERICA!!!!  by the way, i got juicer, breville, it's rocks!!! orange juice now taste like orange, not some sugary orange stuff from plastic bottle that loaded with BPA.  THANK YOU KRIS!!!! LOVE YOUR BLOG, LOVE YOUR HAPPINESS!!! LOVE YOUR BOOK!!!  MAKE JUICE, NOT WAR!!!  DO SVIDANYA!
B003ZTQN1I|3.0|This album on its own is decent, but as the soundtrack for a film where the actors and actresses did such a superb job with their own singing and performances it falls a little flat.  If you want a good compilation from some of the most popular country artists performing today you will be happy.  If you are looking for an opportunity to listen again to the stellar performances from the film you may be disappointed. The songs and performances in the film were exceptional and it is a real shame that the producers chose to go the route of including country super-star versions of songs from the film rather than highlight the pure talent exhibited by the film's stars.
B00393C47M|5.0|\\"Coraline\\" is my all-time favorite book to read because it is funny, scary, and original. It's not a lengthy novel, so it's perfect for a rainy day. I first read \\"Coraline\\" when I was in grade school and fell in love because it is one of the strangest novels I've ever read. It's almost too disturbing to be classified as children's literature, but at the same time it's creative and is an easy read. I suggest \\"Coraline\\" to students in the fifth or sixth grade. This book is action packed and keeps you on the edge of your seat at all times. I've read the book at least a dozen times and something that I like about it is that every time I read it I discover something new!
B002ZG99N6|4.0|A well written and directed movie on the not so pleasant side of a Boston.  I was given this movie because I am originally from Boston.  Not generally a fan of shoot'm up movies I was surprised to see this one had a much stronger storyline than the preview led me to believe.    I did have to suspend disbelief towards the end though...I mean would a real townie hit Fenway Park?  Please tell me it isn't so!
B0000AUHPG|4.0|This spaghetti western had a great cast but, the move was more of an art form  and much too slow to be really entertaining.  Certainly, the Italian Producers  and Director probably think they really did a wonderful film?

B002ZG99N6|4.0|After a bank robbery he pulled off with his three lifelong friends, Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) from the tough street of Charlestown, Boston, meets Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall), another Charlestown resident. Actually Claire was the manager of the bank they robbed, and they took her as hostage (blindfolded before releasing unharmed) the other day. Not knowing his true identity, Claire starts dating Doug - and Doug dreams of starting a new life - when he is given another assignment to undertake. And the FBI led the agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) is closing in on the robbers.    The strength of Ben Affleck-directed \\"The Town,\\" however, lies not in this romantic part, which I think is weaker than compared to the drama involving male characters. Jeremy Renner as Doug's friend James \\"Jem\\" Coughlin, a gang member readier to use violence, and Pete Postlethwaite as Fergie \\"the Florist\\" deliver standout performances. Blake Lively is also very good as Doug's former lover.     The film is often brutal without showing much blood. The car chases (that take place in the narrow streets) are gripping without using special effects. The slick action sequences are proof of Ben Affleck's talent as director. The locations such as Fenway Park are effectively used as the backdrop for action scenes.    I found \\"The Town\\" was a gripping experience, but while watching that, I couldn't shake off the impression that I had seen it somewhere else. Maybe it was a certain Michael Mann film or something else. With all fine acting and well-executed action sequences, \\"The Town\\" did not reinvent the genre.    Having said that, however, I can say \\"The Town\\" is a well-directed and well-acted crime thriller with some compelling heist scenes.
B000JIHP88|1.0|I was very disappointed when I went to attach this mobile to my crib and it doesn't fit! The attachment is meant for small railings, so if your crib has a lot of wood trim, do not buy this! I'm sad because it's really cute otherwise.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I watched this movie this afternoon and love it!  I am NOT a football fan, so before viewing it, I hoped it wasn't too caught up in the sport to hold my attention, and I was very happy to see it wasn't.  This is a story of love, acceptance, and trust, and being based on a true story, I found it inspiring.  It goes to show that no matter what a person's past is, they can follow their dreams to success.  The acting was brilliant, the message prolific.      I noticed the 'charity' tag on this, but don't agree with this.  People should open their hearts and do what is right.  And I believe the family Michael moved in with were just as blessed by the experience as he was, and they all ended up with a loving a family.      I highly recommend this movie to everyone with a DVD player and a heart.  Loved it!
0856261793|5.0|First and foremost I have to say that Sugar Blues is a passionatly written. Why is that important? Because you will also find that Duffy's passion can potentially become yours as well.<br /><br />Though the copy I bought is written in '75, it could have easily been written in 2011. I think I found 1 fact that could have been updated, but it wasn't important enough to recall!<br /><br />There is a lot about the history of sugar, which really was more interesting than a drag to read.<br /><br />After reading this book, I can say I am not inclined to have added sugar in my diet. If you are trying to loose weight and need a reason why you shouldn't go for those Oreo's, let this be mandatory reading for you!<br /><br />Sugar Blues does not go specifically into the science of sugar and the disesases it may be linked to, though it does touch on it.

B0021L8V0W|5.0|I rented this movie and watched it last night; I must say I was thoroughly impressed.  The story had plenty of action in it, but in all fairness was much more than merely another spy action flick.  They kept feeding you just enough contradicting information to keep you second guessing what you thought was really happening.      In case you havent seen the previews, the story starts when a Russian defector turns himself in to the CIA to inform them about an assassination plot against the Russian president when he attends the American vice presidents funeral.  The final bit of information he gives on the plot is the name of the would-be assassin; Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie).  The part that I felt was never addressed in the previews was why she would run instead of just proving she wasnt going to kill anyone.  She runs because she is afraid that the Russians may have her husband and she leaves to find him.  I thought this added some realism to the movie rather than taking the direction \\"Im going to run because Im innocent\\".  At this point the movie is part Bourne, part The Fugitive and all around captivating.  I wont go any further that this so that there wont be any spoilers.    Here are a few other things that I liked about the movie, the first being the movie versions.  In a day and age when most movies try to milk you out of every penny offering a theatrical version, followed by the extended, and finally directors cuts of the movie, Salt offers all three versions on one Bluray.  I chose to watch the Directors Edition,  I havent done the research to see what all the differences are as of yet, but I thought it would be a good place to start.  One of the differences that I noticed was the lack of \\"sexual scenes\\", especially those that were in the previews, gone is Angelina's typical \\"sex symbol\\" role.  I noticed this when I was watching the bonus content \\"Salt: Disclosed\\" and they flashed through a few scenes that were in the previews that I retroactively noticed werent in the directors cut.  The thing that I liked about this is that usually \\"directors cuts\\" add in either more sex or violence that they had to cut to make a more favorable rating.  The fact that the director cut the \\"sex\\" to make the movie more like he wanted really stood out to me.  I dont have any problems with mature content in mature movies, but I thought it was admirable to not just cash in on the extra draw of more nudity or sexual situations, and rather focus on making the movie just how you want it.  Also retrospectively I noticed that I dont believe there was any profanity in the movie, or very little at most.  On the other hand the violence was quite brutal and abrupt.  I dont mean that it was gorey or over the top or uncalled for, quite the opposite.  It felt that the violence matched the type of people in the movie, these are all trained CIA and Russian agents, they arent going to spend a lot of time hesitating to shoot someone who is a threat to them, and arent going to waste a lot of time regretting having to have shot someone who just tried to kill them.      All these things together made a movie good enough that not only do I plan to purchase the movie, but I would like to go back and watch the other two versions of the movie and try and see what all the differences are.  Both Angelina and Liev put up great performances, and fans of either should watch this movie, also any fans of the spy/thriller genre will definitely enjoy it as well.

Classic Jillian, with comments like, \\"If you're looking for an alternative to jumping jacks, look elsewhere. I get 400 pound people to do jumping jacks, you can do them too!\\" Can't really argue with that logic. Breaking the workouts into three 20-minute circuit-based sessions (Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced)was a stroke of genius. I also grant an extra star for being easy to do in a small space. Buy this DVD, you won't be disapplinted.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|First: transaction with Amazon, including S&H, went without a hitch. As for the knife itself, despite reading the glowing review, I was still impressed when I received it! Excellent construction, the sheath is superb and the blade is so thick it can be used as a pry bar. All in all, the perfect tool for WTSHTF.
055358202X|5.0|If you want a top notch fantasy novel, that doesn't protect its characters this is the book for you.  The 4th book in the amazing series Song of Ice and Fire, A Feast For Crows.  Picks up where the 3rd book left off and takes you on amazing journey through Westeros as the large cast of characters contuines on their quests, dreams and grabs for power.  If you want a well crafted story where characters feel alive and you cringe when they die this the book for you.  This book isnt for those who just want a fun adventure where you know the heores will make it, but if you want a rich fantasy world where the characters come alive this is the series for you.
0316044938|5.0|\\"My name was Salmon, like the fish; first name, Susie. I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973.\\" Susie Salmon was brutally murdered and it will take all the courage of her family, friends, and community to stop this cold-blooded killer in their tracks, before her case fades away. Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones, broke and warmed my heart at the same time, with its melancholy tone and deep life lessons.  The Lovely Bones definitely is an eye opener to real life scenarios and themes. It really teaches and makes you realize how much you should spend every day like it is your last. Your life can flash before you in just a blink of an eye, and it is definitely not worth wasting a second of. Family members can suddenly be taken from you and you're left in the darkness to cope with the grief and sadness.  The main character, Susie Salmon, an outgoing fourteen year old girl, truly lives every day like there is no tomorrow. When things go terribly wrong on her walk across the corn field, the once quiet neighborhood seems to come alive. She and her father share a special bond, but her mother, Abigail, seems to keep her distance. Her younger brother and sister, Lindsey and Buckley, once lively, slowly fade away, the years following their sister's death. Nobody on the block can walk by without taking a glance at the ugly green house home to George Harvey. He is one of the suspects among the neighborhood. All of the characters have their individual personalities and Sebold really brings them to life in her writing. The plot and story of the novel is realistic and could very well be inspired by a true story.      The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold is a realistic mystery. If you do not mind reading a tearjerker then this book is probably one of the best you will ever read. If you are afraid you might cry then I advise not to pick up this novel. It is well-suited for a girl or boy's style. It is all told in Susie Salmon's point of view, giving you a real insight on the author's view of heaven. This is for sure one the best, most sad and eye opening books I have read.     The plot of this book shatters your heart at first, but as you read further the holes seem to mend back together, as do the character's hearts. Susie Salmon's life tragically comes to an end on her peaceful walk home from school. The police department eventually discovers the crime scene and confirms that it was a murder. Her family members can barely carry on with their lives without the memory of Susie slipping into their minds. Susie watches from her heaven as her family goes through ups and downs without her. Her family begins to accept her death, while other events bloom in her brother and sister's lives. Susie finally accepts that she has left earth, but it still bothers her that her murderer has never been accused. Read The Lovely Bones to discover if her family ever discovers the truth and if her murderer is ever punished for the blood-chilling crime.  \\"
0385341679|5.0|I waited for a year for this book and I was not disappointed. While I envisioned any number of endings, I think this one did the series justice. I tied up Mac's story line but left a lot of unanswered questions that can be made into a new series.   Life isn't tidy, why should a book be? If she never wrote another book I would be able to imagine what happened to Barron's and the others 1000's of years ago but since she is, I wait in anticipation for how she sees the world she created.     This series was based on Celtic myth, magic and heavy world building and I love it! It wasn't a love story but there was sexual tension and love interests.     Great series!

B002ZG98CS|4.0|Better than Planet Terror.<br />Almost as good as Desperado.<br />This is a return to form for RRodriguez, whose recent work sometimes comes across way too indulgent and desperately in need of a re-write.  Yes he can write 'em, shoot 'em, edit 'em and score 'em, but he does not always do the best job in every one of those categories. This time he shares writing and directing duties, and the \\"fun\\" factor increases exponentially. Collaboration should be RR's mantra from now on.  It works.<br />The Film is well paced and tosses story, action, story at you at 100mph!  It features FOUR BAD GUYS!<br />Talk about giving you your moneys worth!<br />Beats the pants of QT's Death Proof and RR's own Planet Terror.<br />Could have been ten or fifteen minutes shorter and I'm not sure you'd miss it.  But that's just being nit-picky.<br />Some of the \\"humor\\" almost tips it, but not quite.<br />Watching Danny Trejo do his slow burn and then kick ass is simply wonderful.<br />Reminds you of an old Charles Bronson movie (in the best ways).<br />Shows you of how valuble a true star like Danny Trejo is.  He holds the screen all on his own as DeNiro and others pass by.<br />The real test: you don't wish there was more DeNiro, you wish there was more Machete!<br />Hopefully the tease at the end for the TWO more sequels will come to pass.<br />This movie easily falls into the \\"BUY\\" category.

B004BLJQOK|4.0|I thought the movie was great my only problem with it is WHY! THE HELL! would someone replace FANGS! for ZOMBIE TEETH! I've never seen the origional, but soon I'll pick it up.
0440419514|5.0|I don't know how I missed this series growing up but after just finishing the first novel in the trilogy I can happily say that this series is so engrossing and so complex that I didn't want the first book to end- and then couldn't wait to start the second. It is SO beautifully written and keeps you guessing till the very end- I wish more young people were reading things like this instead of empty literature like Twilight. Two thumbs WAY up from me!
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|This time I think Yoko did something really good! The stripped down version is incredible! A must have for all john's fans!
B001AQT0ZO|1.0|I agree with Robert.  The vast majority of the actors in this production quite obviously did not understand the words they were saying.  This was an extremely poor adaptation of a great work.  There are many, many good productions of Shakespeare's work, why did they feel the need to try to \\"modernize\\" such a great story?    I found it to be absolutely pathetic.  It would have been \\"OK\\" if the actors had actually understood the work.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Hardcore Trek fans may balk at the plot-lite action-heavy nature of this latest outing, but for anyone looking for a fun, humor and action-packed movie evening with friends and popcorn, this is highly recommended. And the blu-ray is a wonderful showcase for your home theater system - the visuals are crisp and colorful and the sound will have your neighbors quaking in fear. There are a lot of extras exclusive to the blu-ray release, so if you own a blu-ray player there is no reason you shouldn't be adding this film to your collection.
B002RKSCA6|5.0|This is a great book!  It's so good that I finished it in about three and a half hours!  This taught me that if we ever beleive we are bigger and better than God the Almighty, and think we can fight the devil by ourselves, we just lose the battle between good and evil.  Even if you don't look at the moral you should still read this book!  :D
B004B32532|5.0|Santa Sangre is a brilliant surreal film from Jodorowsky and this blu-ray is the best way to experience it at home. The lush natural color scheme of the hi-definition transfer and spectacular sound hugely enhanced my enjoyment of this bizarre classic. Tons of great extras too - I haven't checked them out but they sound like great value for money.
030726999X|5.0|This book was excellent and capped the series off well. Although, I think there was still some wiggle room to have a fourth book! This book is definitely a top read of the year!
0812979656|3.0|I've never read anything like The God of Small Things before. The words, the phrases, the structure - all fresh and alive. After reading such magnificent prose, I feel like my writing has changed. I feel like I'm no longer bound by the usual, common sense rules of writing. In this, Arundhati Roy is a genius.<br /><br />Paragraph by paragraph, the story is stunning and beautiful. I felt transformed into a child again, where words run together and ordinary things have extraordinary meanings. The composition of the novel was unlike anything I've encountered, or even imagined was possible.<br /><br />It's as if Arundhati Roy wrote the story chronologically on a deck of playing cards, then threw them in the air and constructed the book as she gethered the cards in her hands. The tale is out-of-order, and not in the usual way. While reading, I remained in awe of this new kind of storytelling. At the same time, though, I often managed to get lost and had to turn back a few pages to find my way again. What makes this story brilliant also makes it difficult and sometimes exhausting.<br /><br />Another interesting aspect of the writing is that you know the outline within the first chapter. There is no suspense for what is coming, but rather how it comes. The reader is taken back and back again to the same events, but is given more knowledge and detail with each revisit. I would almost say that this is a novel best read a second time.<br /><br />Rating this book is difficult. I feel like it should be read for the extraordinary language and unique construction rather than for pure leisure. It is a must-read if you're a writer or aspiring writer, but probably okay to skip if you aren't.
B004EQAVHI|1.0|This movie gives excruciatingly bad new meaning altogether. Just when I thought The Road and Blue couldn't be topped in presenting a bleak, depressingly drawn out film along comes Never Let Me Go and makes me rethink how bad cinema can get. We are presented with three children in this movie who are told of the fate that awaits them as organ donors yet although given nearly every opportunty refuse to try and live a normal life. Instead, they gleefully just hand over their organs one by one, ostensibly for.. the good of a society that treats them like cattle and doesn't even acknowledge the idea of them having souls? Somehow, I think they just might rebel against such a fate. Yet no, they do not. They are all too eager to fulfill the destiny set before them and leave it at that. This film is a study in complete and total mindless subservience to a system for which the lead characters should feel no sense of loyalty or duty to whatsoever yet we are meant to feel empathy for their condition? I'm sorry, but I felt none for them since they couldn't be bothered to even respect themselves in the slightest.

0312330871|3.0|Mystery is not my favorite genre by far but I just had to read at least one Agatha Christie novel.  And Then There Were None is one of her best, if not most famous book. It centers around the arrival of ten strangers to a secluded island where one by one they're picked off. The killer remains anonymous to the end and as a reader you're going to try to guess who's it is and just when you think you have it solved, surprise-you're wrong! This book is the basis for the 80's cult classic Clue. One of my favorite movies, so if you've seen that you basically know the entire book but why not read the original. Just when you think you know what's going on A.C. has some nice surprises in store for you!
B0035OC7OU|5.0|Terry Pratchett makes me angry, plain and simple. Not because his books are bad. In fact, quite the opposite - his books are so effortlessly good, so overflowing with rich humor and fascinating characters, so incredibly imaginative, that it makes me angry that he makes it look so ridiculously easy. I mean, Mort is a story in which Death takes on an apprentice for reasons that become more and more clear as the book develops, and over the course of the book, you have foiled assassinations, wizards who become terrified of statues, a massive wave of forgetfulness that doesn't even respond to large posters, an introduction to Death's adopted daughter, a terrifying beast named Binky...and that doesn't even really get into the story. And the man juggles it all perfectly, never dropping a ball and never letting any character get less than the right amount of time, even in such a short book. Even more infuriating? The way Pratchett takes such an iconic \\"character\\" as Death and makes something wholly new and wondrous out of it, something wholly unique and unforgettable. How can you do all that and make it this fun, this funny, and this imaginative, and make it look this easy? It just isn't fair. But you know, I guess I can't complain - not when his books make me this happy and this thrilled to be reading. And the fact that I still have some left to read is even better. Look - if you haven't read any of Pratchett's Discworld books, go. Go now and buy one - really, any of them. But Mort is an awfully good one to get started with.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|For those who have commented on the \\"muddy mix\\" of too much bass, I would say to re-adjust your tone controls to a flat setting. You all have probably over compensated for the digital age of crappy sound - edgy treble and fake digital bass. On a fine hifi system with no tone controls and the subwoofer set to a flat response this CD sounds WONDERFUL!!! It's a rare CD these days that is not over compressed with ear bleeding cymbals and in your face dynamics. This CD sounds so naturally analog that I have repeated listening since I got it yesterday. Sitting in the stereo \\"sweet spot\\" it sounds so right and natural that I ask why other major artists don't make their cd's sound like this (Springsteen, Santana). A great job by Mr. Allman but a special pat on the back to T-Bone for the mix. Fabulous!!!!!! 5 Stars!!!!
B00475BUVM|1.0|We enjoyed the movie itself but as far as the 3-D went, don't bother with it. We had a hard time telling if we were in 3-D or not. It seemed as though only parts of the movie were in 3-D. Seriously, if you're buying this movie for the 3-D don't bother!
0345479092|3.0|I liked a lot of the advice in this book, but that is after having read about a billion books on parenting and babies and pregnancy in general.  The sections on how to get your baby to sleep can be helpful.  We extended our daughter's naps and night sleeping a bit by loosely following this.  The best advice that I took (with my own interpretation) was the EASY routine.  Basically, I didn't want to have to nurse my baby to sleep (and if you don't mind, that's fine - then ignore her) and so started an Eat, Activity, Sleep routine.  This has been great and I have not needed to nurse my daughter to sleep unless I chose to use that secret weapon as a pacifier for a sick or teething little one.  What I largely ignored was any of her weaning advice.  I disagree that you start introducing solids with the intention of weaning a baby - if you are following professional, educated, medical, advice, you should be nursing until your child is AT LEAST one.  I just totally ignored her section on feeding, because I felt she was quite ignorant about how breastfeeding worked.    One note that some reviewers seem to miss - you are not supposed to attempt 'sleep training' until your child is at least 4 months, I believe she says.  Similarly, don't make a baby under 4 months wait 4 hours between nursing, etc.  The reality is babies cry when they need something.  Tracy, if nothing else, accepts that you shouldn't leave your baby alone to sort it out - and I like her suggestions that having been all over the map and trying various things like cry-it-out can break a babies trust.  Babies cry, and you as the caregiver are responsible for their needs.  Sometimes it sucks and is exhausting and frustrating, but there is, quite literally, a life in your hands.
B00356CO1E|5.0|Didn't consider myself to be that out of shape, but this workout kicked my butt. I confess I had to stop it a couple times just to rest for a few seconds, but hopefully soon I won't have to. Just stick with it and do what you can...do a little bit more and push yourself a little bit further each time and soon it'll be easy!
0345528581|5.0|Ok, I bought this book expecting that it would have some bodyweight exercises nothing too exciting.  Im trying to shift my focus from a bodybuilding mind set to a more functional strength training. I want my strength gains to translate into daily living. I agree with his statement that the whole point of doing strength exercises is to be able to be stronger in everyday life not just as he puts it: \\"throw plates around in the gym\\".  I love his no nonsense attitude, also his writing style makes you feel like you are talking to him which makes it more fun.  Well Im sold, makes total and perfect sense, if you want your body to do something you must train it using that same movement repeatedly. While my training at the gym has helped me increase my muscle mass and helped me to lose inches, the gains I have made have not translated so well into functional strength. My puffing at the lateral pulldown machine did not toughen me up and help me to do pull ups which is my goal.  There are a huge number of exercises--I have not counted but he said 125--which includes awesome variations. The variations are both to scale up and scale down. His writing is very entraining, there is a little bar hoping story in there that had me laughing it up. I very highly recomend this book for anyone either looking to gain functional strength regardless of whether you are a beginner--such as myself--or an elite athlete. Believe me there are plenty of advanced exercises in there for you buffs.  He a has all sorts of ideas on how to combine the exercises for a great workout: pyramids, ladders circuits and a whole bunch of other stuff. He talks about intervals and tabatas if you need to decrease your body fat. Also helps you figure out your daily caloric requirements for gaining and losing. He makes it clear that it is going to be hard work and that it will take time. His honesty wins my vote.  Some people might belly acke about his attitude about cardio. Well, let me tell you I myself have testedthis. Im  overweight. I have tried every diet known to men as well as regular old cardio and guess what it got me? Nothing nada but headaches and dizziness due to the severe restrictions of calories recommended.  Any weight I lost I quickly gained back when I could not stay on the diets anymore plus some more.  I stumbled upon all of this by accident when I decided that maybe I was supposed to be big and might as well be big and strong. I droped the cardio and started just concentrating on strength training and eating much more than all the diets out there.  I have been at it for about 1 month and a half. Im eating about 2000-2100 calories a day high protein and balanced between carbs and fat. I have lost two inches off my waist. No dizzy spells no bad temper or irritability due to hunger. True my strength training workouts are intense but Im not hungry and that makes me a happy camper. let it be noted that he does not say that all cardio is useless for fat loss. He is only talking about steady state cardio. He is all for short intense interval sessions--please read the book before you start mouthing off--. I have to confess though that in that whole month that I have been working out and eating well I have done maybe a total of 10 mins of cardio and that just also interval. I do plan to add more interval to my workouts because they are just hella fun. I particularly like jump rope intervals and it kicks ma bootie. I found this study online about balance diet+ high intensity cardio+strength training vs moderate cardio+ good ole food pyramid diet. I will leave it here for you, read to your hearts content [...]
0740797719|5.0|This book offers a very well-organised and succinct discussion of colour and its usage. After having read through it only once, it has already proven very valuable in helping me to solve colour problems with which I've grappled for many years. The author's breakdown of colour and light issues in painting - and the ways in which to address those issues - is superb. I highly recommend this book.
B004D7GU3C|3.0|There is no doubt that Ricky can entertain and he's one of the few bilingual singers out there who sounds as well in Spanish as he does in English. We are all aware of his career highlights, but unfortunately this one is not one of them for me. It's \\"nice\\" but lacks \\"alma\\" and def. \\"sexo.\\" It is at best a pedestrian connects the dots release and not the home-run that I was hoping that it would be. His first single with Joss falls under \\"nice\\" but the release needs some sexy soulful Ricky and certainly one who gets you moving.

B00007ELEL|5.0|I admit it, I didn't get the Dude the first time out. Since that first viewing I have seen it many many times and this is one snowball of a movie. It actually gets funnier each time you see it. There were bits in the film that I smiled at and in later viewings couldn't stop laughing at (the phone scene at Maude's place). This has happened more times than I can count. It's a masterpiece in my book and one of my top ten films.<br /><br />Sometimes there's a movie, I won't say a great movie because what is a great movie? Sometimes there's a movie, for it's time and place - it fits right in there. That's the Big Lewboski. Spend sometime with the Dude, you won't regret it.
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|This book is extremely convoluted the first third of the book, but then things start to even out and we are left with an excellent fantasy book that seems to combine the adventurism  of say scott lynch with the politicking of GRRM.  IMO best fantasy writer living today...Amazing that the author was/is an anthropologist.

1934356476|5.0|This is one of the best Ruby books I've ever read. (BTW, another one of the best is \\"Design patterns in Ruby\\".)    Now I'm reading it the second time. It's enjoyable reading it.     If you're a serious Ruby developer, you HAVE TO own a copy of it.
B000002KDS|5.0|This is simply a rock classic from a classic band at their peak, I am surprised to see any alice fan give this one less than five stars though. But the lowest here is a three star! and that says it all, this is a true classic rocker that lays down solid shock rock like 'halo of flies' and 'dead babies' and then slams forward with  great songs that were at least big fm radio hits 'under my wheels' and 'be my lover' two 'hits' imo by any standard. That's quite good for a band that was like a horror movie made into music! That's what alice cooper the band was and this wasn't just alice , he had a talented band of stalwarts all the way. One has sadly passed away since then but the great tunes live on and any metal or hard rock fan should add this one to their classic metal mix.
B003IPC5UC|5.0|Kylie's eleventh studio album changed directions from the previous three (`Fever', `Body Language' and `X'), which had (on several of their tracks) adopted a harder edge as compared with albums 1-7. `Aphrodite' gets back to being smooth; for instance, the power synths on `X' have given way to atmospheric, strongly reverberant, and at times breathy patches, such that at times the lyrics are difficult to decipher. The emotions expressed, and the melodies and harmonies tend towards more intense sorts than many on some of the songs on `Light Years' (album #7, the last of her CD's that can be characterized as `smooth' all the way through), though here, there is plenty of playfulness as well.<br /><br />The storytelling, formal structure and progressions, the melodic expressiveness, etc. hearken back to quality tunes from Sixties groups as diverse as Jefferson Airplane, (the) Four Tops, and the Supremes. Quite frankly, much of the songwriting, arrangements and performances are baffling, stunning, exemplary, and so on. Surely I wouldn't quite put it on the level of `Surrealistic Pillow', but the comparison is instructive.<br /><br />I'm not convinced that the overall quality, variety, and flow of the tracks quite matches Minogue's other two best overall efforts, those being `Let's Get to It' (album #4) and `Fever' (album #7). But more careful and long-term listening may change my opinion about it.<br /><br />THE INDIVIDUAL SONGS:<br /><br />\\"All the Lovers\\" [5++ stars]<br />The song set begins with this marvelous exhortation to dance. The video, which can be found on both You-Tube and on the CD single, is not to be missed - you'll know the version to which I'm referring when you see the growing pyramid of dancers with Kylie at the apex - the song is extraordinarily uplifting, in consonance with the visual metaphor.<br /><br />\\"Get Outta My Way\\" [5 +++ stars]<br />Emotional anthem not unlike \\"Spinning Around\\" (from `Light Years') in terms of lyrical theme; jacks up the emotional intensity to an even more feverish pitch; continues the exhortation to dance begun with the previous track.<br /><br />\\"Put Your Hands Up (If You Feel Love Tonight)\\" [5++ stars]<br />Great `audience-participation' and dance track. Took awhile for me to warm up to this one, but it really does work well -  a true \\"feel good\\" song<br /><br />\\"Closer\\" [5++++++ stars]<br />Blistering dance track - one of her best ever - breathy synthesizer sounds and intensely moving melodic lines make for an immersion experience. Kylie goes out of her mind on this one (in a good way of course)!<br /><br />\\"Everything is Beautiful\\" [5 +++++++ stars]<br />This medium-tempo stunner took awhile for me to get used to - now I'm convinced it's one of the finest songs I've ever heard/experienced.<br /><br />\\"Aphrodite\\" [5+++ stars]<br />By terms boastful and blistering - great contrasts in terms of levels of intensity, and the humorous vocal hook \\"can you feel me in stereo?\\" (shades of \\"Speakerphone\\" from `X') drive this back and forth, in and out, all around.<br /><br />\\"Illusion\\" [5+++++++++ stars]<br /> Reminds me, not in terms of style, but of emotional intensity, story-telling, melodic inventiveness, imaginative formal structure/progression (etc.) of the best of the Supremes from the mid-sixties, especially \\"Reflections\\", but also \\"Love is Here - Now You're Gone\\", \\"Love is Like an Itching in My Heart\\", and so. The comparison with Motown song-writing, arranging and all-star backing tracks can be found all over this CD and many other Kylie tracks in terms of quality, even though the styles are very different, and from different eras.<br /><br />\\"Better than Today\\" [5 stars]<br />Another medium-tempo gem! Please locate and view the video, which very much helps tell the story via great choreography, shifting camera angles, costumes, and so on.<br /><br />\\"Too Much\\" [4½ stars]<br />A blistering dance track (not so much a listening track) - this does some of the things \\"Aphrodite\\" does, though not quite as well. I wouldn't ever kick it off the dance floor, though; and I'd not be surprised if while dancing to it, at various junctures, my head suddenly would fly off - metaphorically, of course!<br /><br />\\"Cupid Boy\\" [5++++ stars]<br />Kylie lets loose even more than on \\"Aphrodite\\". Though the levels of intensity don't vary quite as much; overall it's at least as strong, churning out more interesting melodic contours, and with greater suppleness.<br /><br />\\"Looking For an Angel\\" [5+++ stars]<br />The varying emotional signatures in the different sections make this one a stunner after enough times listening to it.

0316069884|5.0|Excellent, informative book. A must read. Well researched (over 50 pages of notes detailing where the information came from)! It is well-written; part story, with a lot of facts, but reads as more of a story. Information that is generally hidden from us. Besides the notes, he includes a resource guide if you want more information.  Other reviews comment on Pollan's books (I've read several including the Omnivore's Dilemma). I prefer this one.
0061703087|5.0|Admittedly, it has been a while since I have read this book (about 4 years), but that just testifies that it left a lasting impression on me. For me, it was the science in the book that intrigued me. The detail Crichton goes through to explain how the nano particles work was absolutely fascinating! I would not let the science aspect of this book deter any readers, though. It is a great action book that will keep you in suspense from start to finish.

0440245915|4.0|A Time to Kill is one of the first books that Grisham published and one of the best he has written. In this action packed Carl Lee's daughter, Tanya, is missing, which she eventually gets beaten by some redneck guys. When the guys get convicted of doing this to Tanya, Carl Lee goes crazy and kills the guy who had beaten his daughter. While the trial goes on The Lawyer, Jake, becomes Carl's lawyer. While he is the lawyer, he and his family become under fire from a clan that is trying to intimidate them. as the book goes on the odds are against Jake and Cal Lee on winning the case. At the end of the book they win the case.  This is one of those books that when you start reading you will not put it down until the books is over
1595141715|5.0|My good friend Mike recommended this book to me with the warning \\"It looks like something a preteen girl would read but believe me it's better.\\" I laughed and immediately bought this book here at Amazon.com. I don't know exactly what i was expecting because i had no idea what the book was about until in came in the mail. From start to finish this book is a roller coaster ride. I thought knowing that she killed herself at the end would take away the urgency in reading it but i found myself having to remind myself to calm down and stop skipping ahead from excitement and suspense. It's a mystery with a brilliant message and a the kind of idea and story that will stick with you long after you close the book. And, as i later found out, it's the kind of book that you just have to pass on and recommend after you've read it. It's that good.
B003Q6D25K|4.0|So I just finished watching Paranormal Activity 2. You usually know when the end is coming, with this one you never do. I found this to be a scary sequel to the very scary Paranormal Activity. The first one had images that stayed with me, I have just seen the second, I hope I'll be sleeping peacefully. Not one of the best films of the year but definitely worth watching. It remains to be seen what they'll do with the upcoming third part of the trilogy?!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Ever American should watch this series, and the followup series, The Pacific, to gain a sense of how this generation helped to save the world. I served in the military for 10 years, and I already had a health respect for the Americans that served their country before me. However, after seeing the series I get very emotional about the services the WWII generation gave to the world.

B0042RJWTC|5.0|Historically, this miniseries was very accurate and informative. As for the dialog, and small events, there was a lot of liberates taken by the producers and writers, but they did a masterful job putting these four seasons together for Showtime. My wife and I watched the series twice on Showtime, and have seen it twice on DVD since we purchased it last December (pre-ordered). Definitely a must have if you are a serious collector of good shows/DVDs.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This movie was everything I had hopped the Expendables was going to be! A fun movie that handles aging action stars the right way. A good story with excellent actors doing what they do best. Just the right combination of humor and action. Bruce Willis really knows how to have a good time in front of the camera and he let's the audience share the moment.

B004D7GU3C|5.0|Ricky Martin's newest CD is probably his best ever!  There's something for everyone here - some danceable songs that make you want to get up and shake it, there's a \\"feel good\\" song \\"The Best Thing About Me Is You\\" done in both Spanish and English, but where Ricky really shines is his heartfelt ballads.  \\"Basta Ya\\" and \\"Tu Y Yo\\", are sung with such intensity and passion, it brings tears to my eyes.  And I don't speak a word of Spanish!!  You can feel and hear the emotion in his voice. Ricky is in a very good place in his life and you can tell by the songs in this CD.  He co-wrote all the songs, a first for Ricky and he proves himself to be a great songwriter as well as singer.  You will love this CD even if you don't speak Spanish.  A great job by a superb entertainer!

B004BBDHEK|2.0|I ordered this CD because as a Yanni fan, I figured this one had to be good.  After his Yanni voices CD with all that opera, I was ready for Yanni to get back to his roots to what he does best, his instrumentals. But this CD doesn't do it.  I found it way too \\"tame\\" for Yanni and I miss all those live instruments and those driving beats.  Each song sounded the same and reminded me of music you hear on the phone when you're put on hold - nice, but rather boring. I wanted to really love this CD and was very disappointed with this one.  He seems to be exploring different kinds of music, which is fine, but he seems to be off his mark and not where he used to be with his earlier CD's.  I miss the old Yanni and want him back!
B004BBDHEK|5.0|This album is one of the best studio albums that Yanni has produced to date. The variety of music, the unique sounds, & the emotion of Yanni's music reaches right into your soul. Many of the songs like \\"Vertigo\\" will make you want to get up & dance. \\"Voyage\\" sends you to unvisited places. \\"Flash of Color\\" makes you feel like you are on a tropical island with an exotic drink in your hand. The entire album has something for everyone, & is a must have, make you feel happy album.

B002WY64HA|5.0|The first time I was introduced to Arcade Fire, I was hesitant to buy into the hype that they \\"are one of the 5 best new bands since 2000,\\" according to a few sources. I heard a few songs, and was impressed, but just didn't understand the hype. Then I listened to Neighborhood #1.     From the first track on Funeral, I was hooked. It's beautiful, and to this day, will still bring a tear to my eye. I learned that, as with many great albums, it is important to listen to it in entirety. Splitting it up will ruin the experience. The songs, while great on their own, are made magnificent when played back to back.    Some will call Arcade Fire an overly dramatic band, and point to Funeral as a prime example for good reason. It is a very dramatic album to the point that some will find it pretentious. To me, it's that very human emotion that is woven throughout the album that I love. It's a postmodern take on the human condition and emotion.    Regardless, I wholeheartedly recommend the Vinyl edition of Funeral. It sounds wonderful, has some of the best packaging I've ever seen (thank you for poly sleeves... why can't more artists use these) and you will not regret it.
B001L5U15M|4.0|I have been lugging camera gear around for 30 yrs , and I have probably used every type of camera bag imaginable. That being said I have found the Tamrac Velocity bags ( previously owned the Velocity 7 and now just procured the Velocity 10),are probably some of the best bags for Photographers on the go in both a urban and Suburban setting. The Bag sits well on your back , provides easy access (who cares what side it zips from) and holds 2 camera bodies or 1 camera body with a few lenses and other accessories that the photographer on the go would need. Overall I give the bag a 4 out of 5 stars the only shortcoming is the lack of back ventilation/padding which would in my opinion take this from a exceptional to a perfect camera bag.
0307474275|5.0|This book is exhilarating from cover to cover. The change of scene that comes with the chapter change can prove hard to read, but it begs for you to turn the next page. Readers must remember that it is a fictitious book and while the content can be true at times, it is also bent or construed in such a way to convey a compelling and exciting novel. Jump in, but be careful to schedule in time to finish it because you may just end up reading cover to cover!

B003C1QIO6|5.0|Let me preface this by saying I am a huge Jack Johnson fan.  So take my review for what it's worth.  It's hard to review music because we all have different tastes.  For me, this hits the mark.  But I've not heard a Jack song that hasn't \\"hit the mark\\".  Good music (imo) evokes some sort of feeling or emotion that keeps you coming back for more.  The feelings/ emotions I typically experience with JJ's music range from sunny/ cheerful/\\"feel good\\" to more mellow/ contemplative... or nostalgia... or possibly a combination of the aforementioned.  No matter the feeling, I truly enjoy listening to his music, and this album is no exception.<br /><br />Outside of his music, Jack is an all-around great guy.  An adoring husband, involved father, environmental activist, etc-- and it's all genuine.  He doesn't pretend to be something he's not... what you see is what you get.  His lyrics seems to be from his heart and I can relate to his music.  When it's all said and done, I find myself gravitating toward music I can relate to.  For some, Jack is too mellow (count my husband in that crowd)- for me, he's perfect.  This is my style, tried and true.  So if you're already NOT a Jack Johnson fan, this album may not work for you.<br /><br />Not only do I find all the songs on this album catchy and \\"familiar\\", I find myself listening to it over and over (as do my 3 and 5 year old- I really appreciate the universal appeal Jack has!).  I agree with a previous reviewer who stated that the familiarity of Jack (another criticism of some) is what makes him great. Jack is reliable - but not in a boring way. This album, though slightly different from the others, doesn't stray far from the original Jack Johnson.  All the songs are catchy- if I heard them on the radio for the first time, I would want to find out who the artist is.  One thing about musicians that gets me is you hear a great single on the radio, go out and buy the album, and the rest of it is boring.  No feeling/ no catchy tunes/etc.  Not so with this album or any of Jack's albums, for that matter.<br /><br />Five stars from me!  Keep doing what you're doing Jack!!!

1439107955|4.0|Full disclosure: I'm a 20-month multiple myeloma survivor. After all the glowing reviews, I really wanted to like this book. I did, but not as much as I was hoping. On the positive side, we get a lucid history of the War on Cancer; of the much longer war against cancer that was waged, mostly futilely, before it began; and how we got where we are today. The author also does an excellent job of focusing attention on the perennial tension between the desire of scientists to direct resources toward the effort of understanding how cancer works in order to more effectively attack it, and the desire of desperate patients and their families to get treatments -- any treatments -- right away, to keep them from dying today. These topics take up a large majority of the book. But then, toward the end, it kind of falls apart. The train arrives at the end of the line to a mostly empty station. I do think the author oversells the new targeted therapies. He specifically calls out multiple myeloma as a shining example of their effectiveness. There is certainly no denying that the statistical improvements he trots out are real. But as an experienced clinical oncologist, he surely knows that, for myeloma patients who are young enough and strong enough to endure it, the weapon of choice remains the old tried and true -- and quite horrendous -- peripheral blood stem cell transplant. For such patients, the targeted drugs are relegated to the supporting roles of induction and maintenance therapies. He knows this, but doesn't mention it. Nor does he mention the appalling cost of these drugs: Revlimid, which is being used as my post-transplant maintenance therapy, is costing my insurance company $100K per year. Beyond this, there are niggling annoyances sprinkled throughout, that should probably be attributed to desultory editing. There is the occasional howler, such as the one that earlier reviewers have mentioned (if it's male, it can't be breast cancer: check). And there are more than a couple of instances in which the author makes use of a word that doesn't actually mean what he seems to think it means. This problem is endemic to the blogosphere, but this isn't a blog, it's a book I paid the publisher real money to read. So, no fifth star from me.ouple of instances in which the author makes use of a word that doesn't actually mean what he seems to think it means.

B00007LTIA|5.0|When I had bought the double Vinyl of TALES in the 70s, the two elements that stuck out for me ( before I put the album on) was the splendid and evocative art, and most especially the footnote from Jon Anderson. Jon made reference as I recall to the Autobiography of a Yogi ( a book made popular through the Beatles and their association with the TM Guru ). Anyway, as much as I had read on the topic, the music was just awesome and has remained so for me since then. Pages 12 and 13 of the booklet reproduces what I roughly recall as Jon's \\"footnote\\" on the book he used as inspiration, but there is more then what I recall.         The music is classed as progressive rock, but what I remember from the 70s is that my Rock associates did not like Jon's vocals, and I did. Over time, it struck me that many elements that you can hear in this album have found their ways into the art-form known as Rock ( many types), much the same way that other artists have influenced Rock. So, I strongly suspect that many artists from the late 70s til now have incorporated what they openly or privately heard in this album.Its a work of genius and its great that Rhino has re-produced many classic works when today's music is so empty, and it seems to me that many also steal from the classic artists, still here, or those gone.       I would also note that the Double album is very carefully packaged, and whilst it is not like a reproduction of the vinyl in CD format ( a style I like) it still brings back superb memories, and with the remaster, the clarity is superb.
B004D7GU3C|5.0|I expected something good but was disappointed by the first release, \\"The Best Thing About Me is You.\\"  This song one of two in English is the worst thing about the otherwise supercool album.  The sound is so amazing that it does not matter that you might not understand spanish.  If you like funky dance type music and ballands, then you will appreciate this album.  This is not one to be missed out on.  One of the best albums that I have bought in a very long time.
B000F7CMRM|5.0|The movie itself is superb. As Clooney says in the special features, the star of this film is the screenplay.With Clooney's \\"Bob\\" loosely based on Bob Bauer( to hear more of Bob Bauer, check out his commentary on RED ), this has plenty of realism from the intelligence side, and the consultants are not party political, but as they emphasize, they aim at being a-political; however, I am aware that me saying that is not going to be agree-able to some. Since the film reveals the structure of what happens, and as one producer says, those people doing things that  we might think as morally questionable do not see them as such, in fact they have very good arguments to support their side. So, as stated a few times, its not all black and white but more grey, with plenty of scope for questions.This is a brilliant watch with a superb finish.         The extras show some great material, and the deleted scenes are great, and I would question why they were deleted.          A note about second hand items: I bought this accidentally as second hand ( I thought I had bought a new copy); I did not worry since it was Amazon, and I thought with a rating of \\"Used\\" Very Good\\", I thought it would be great. Well, the digital break up at the start and finish of the film is extreme for a \\"Very Good\\" copy, and might be passable for Good or \\"Okay\\", but not \\"Very Good\\".I will avoid second hand movies in the future.Meanwhile I will hopefully be able to buy a new copy somewhere.

B000E1YVZU|1.0|Really?  This is why I shun nearly all musicals anymore.  Sing what needs to be sung; speak what needs to be said.  And this might have been more enjoyable... just maybe - if that had been the case.  The songs were just awful to begin with.  The forced rhymes and lyrical stupidity.  The checklist of one of each type of expected broadway song.  The bad bad acting.  Idina Menzel baffles me.  She is truly frightening to look at, like a shark in leather pants, and her voice's nearest approximation would be a cat strangling itself.  The whole story is as thin as onion skin and not one of the actor's invests any energy into their character - the exception would be Angel.  And not one of them made me care one iota.  Bleh.

B000R7HY0K|1.0|Of the two movies in \\"Grindhouse\\", \\"planet of terror\\" was fun and \\"deathproof was boring, too talky and had a terrible resolution.<br /><br />It's one thing when Torentino utilizes excessive dialog in a high quality movie where story and plot turns are imperitive components to the movie.<br /><br />But this is \\"Grindhouse\\", not an English art film. There needs to be lots of mega-action and a rational limit on dialog, especially sprawling, philosophical, who cares what you think, rambling talk.<br /><br />You know what this movie is? (sorry about the \\"spoiler alert\\" but there's really no plot to spoil anyway!). They focus on a group of girls, there is a development of character and then they are killed off...run over! And then the movie starts all over again, with a new group of girls, with the expectation that they also will be run over. An these girls talk, and talk, and talk, and talk, and talk, etc. What a borefest!<br /><br />There's so much talk about the 1970's chase movie 'Vanishing Point\\" but there's no big deal car chase in this movie!<br /><br />Torentino was too full of himself for this flick.

1594202842|4.0|It takes billions of years of intense volcanic heat and pressure to transform carbon into diamonds, whose name derives from the ancient Greek word for \\"unbreakable.\\"  Armed with 2000 years of Confucian teachings, a fiery temperament and steely determination, Chua, achieves this alchemy with her children in the span of a few years.    \\"Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother\\" by Amy Chua, chronicles her personal story of using traditional Chinese values [both familial and societal] to transform raw innate intellectual potential into gems of academic brilliance and musical virtuosity.     We watch as Chua methodically marks each accolade in pursuit of Carnegie Hall, ratcheting the bar ever higher for her child prodigies. We wait as Chua harrowingly compresses their formative years into a frenetic pace of study, practice and performance. The reader is left breathless, waiting for not if the cleave will occur, but when.      Chua's book is self-admittedly not a manifesto for child rearing.  Instead, it is at once a piquant memoir of filial piety and an open letter of apology to her daughter's Sophia and Lulu.  It is also extremely funny.  The poignancy of her succinct writing style is heightened by Haiku prose and staccato sentences, conveying the singular intensity and the fast pace of her daily life as wife, mother and Svengali.     Chua off handedly laments, \\"...that I had no talent for novel writing...what's more, Maxine Hong Kingston, Amy Tan, and Jung Chang all beat me to it with their books The Women Warrior, The Joy Luck Club, and Wild Swans.\\"  The \\"it\\" being an \\"...epic novel about mother-daughter relationships spanning several generations...\\" While not epic in span, Chua, as provocateur, humorously explores her immigrant Chinese upbringing and subsequent assimilation, the relationship with her daughters, and her interracial marriage to her Jewish husband.     Chua's \\"no holds-barred\\" accounts of her parenting style and her family life are brutally honest.  She tears away the flesh and muscle to reveal the bones. There is a Confucius quote that states, \\"Better a diamond with a flaw than a pebble without.\\" To all parents raising children, it bears reminding the quote, \\"Let him without sin, cast the first stone.\\"
1439177783|1.0|Someone in my book club picked this book. I have to be honest and say from the beginning I wasn't that interested in reading the book. Nothing against de Rossi - I just never watched any of the shows she's in and didn't know a lot about her. And now, I'm not sure I know that much more.     The book was very tedious to get through, with the writing mediocre at best. She makes grammar mistakes, drones on at times about things that just don't seem that important or read like a how-to for anorexia, and jumps around mid-paragraph - all things an editor should have caught. In one instance, she's talking about her mother and father and how they moved to this new neighborhood and in the next sentence the father is dead. No explanation. I reread the paragraph twice thinking I misread that she said her family (including her father) had moved. Little things like that made the book hard for me to read.     The thing I had the most trouble with was connecting to de Rossi - if this was fiction - I would say how can you like a character that doesn't even like herself? And this holds true for this as well. de Rossi spends so much time telling us how she's not good enough, a part of you is like: ok yeah you're right. It reads very cliché Hollywood starlet that's trying to say how much she hates the fame. I get de Rossi was struggling with self-esteem issues and her sexuality but I didn't feel like she gave enough examples as to why this led to so much self-hatred. The stories of excessive dieting, exercising and self-bashing just grew tiresome. I wanted more reasons why I should care and like her - talk about what it was like to struggle as an actress, or more about why she had decided to drop out of law school or get married the first time.     I think the ending could have been better. It felt like the whole book was about her struggling to admit her sexuality to everyone, struggling to be \\"good enough\\", the eating disorders, etc. and then it just ends with a brief happily ever after. She did touch on her rehab and coming out to the world - but not a lot. And now, we're led to believe that her life is perfect: she's married, she's recovered, her family and Hollywood accept her, she's vegan, and she's thin. The end read too much like the typical Hollywood actress's fitness magazine interview - I don't have to try anymore to be thin - I just eat vegan and don't exercise. Really? Because for hundreds of pages you wasted my time talking about how much of a struggle it was to diet (even though her quest for thin in the past was pretty extreme). It felt like the recovery process was just brushed off. I think the middle of the book with her eating disorder could have been shorter and if she had added to the beginning and ending of the story the book would have ended up a lot deeper.
B00375LMGQ|5.0|There are many themes in this book but, to me, the greatest is the evil of religion and how its avarice nature, unchecked, will worm into lives and destroy all joy and happiness without compunction. This message, wrapped in Waugh's sweet, elegant prose conducts the reader through this poignant, morose tale, that is, even still, utterly delightful.

0316098337|5.0|I can't put into words how beautiful this book is. Really. I sobbed on the bus while reading it yesterday. That I am the same age (give or take a few months) as the main female character in this book added an extra sense of intrigue. Although I'm not a mother, I was able to put myself in 'Ma's' place, and it made the book that much more real to me. Emma Donoghue is brilliant. I randomly picked up 'Touchy Subjects' at a Women's book store a few years ago, and ate up every story. She is incredible at convincingly writing as a male, female, young, old, gay, straight, happy, sad, secular, religious, etc etc etc. I recommend this book to EVERYONE. While fiction isn't my favorite genre, Emma Donoghue is easily a new favorite author.

B000JQUKKU|5.0|This was a great book. I love how Charles Dickens describes the characters and places the way he does. This is a great book, that can sometimes feak you out, sometimes make you laugh. Scrouge is a great character that can help you learn a lesson of love, Christmas, and money. It shows you that you don't have to be rich and powerful to be a great person, and if you are not a grat person for a while, you can change. I am glad I found this free version, otherwise  would not have had this delightful adventure that Charles Dickens has made. I would always recommend this book.
B003G4W49C|5.0|If you do not know any war strategy, you may want to consider putting this book down. otherwise this was one of the best sci fi books I have ever read. I can't wait to read the secnd.
B003EYVXTG|2.0|\\"Winter's Bone\\" is about as dry as one. It's a plodding, poorly-paced movie that did nothing for me.    It earns a star for the performances, which seemed natural throughout, but the actors are portraying undefined characters. Few of them have known, clear motives and practically none have any back story, and it turns out to be the movie's main weakness. That mystery of the character's intentions, rather than intriguing me, made scenes confusing and disjointed. You learn very little about the other players, and by the end (well, probably 25 minutes from the end), I had stopped caring entirely.    It's not a thrilling thriller or a dramatic drama. There are moments in the movie that work, and I did end up feeling for Ree and her struggling family, but when it was over, this movie was wholly forgettable.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|This is an outstanding trip back to being a teenager, since most of my first Beatles records were used mono copies!  The only issues I have are related to the fact that the Capitol issued albums had song versions that the British catalog doesn't match; for instance the longer version of \\"I'll Cry Instead\\" on the mono version of \\"Something New\\" or the version os \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" with the false starts on the original Capitol issue of \\"Rubber Soul\\".  Capitol also was kind enough to include both mono and stereo versions of the albums in The Capitol Albums volumes, why could EMI have not done the same?    Capitol, are you listening?  How about the other Capitol albums,and how about the old United Artists version of \\"A Hard Day's Night\\"?  There's a few of us out there that would buy them!    If nothing else, you could offer these different song versions as downloads.  Still, I recommend this set for the distinctively different listening experience from the stereo mixes; also note that the \\"Mono Masters\\" version of \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" sounds more like the old false stereo mix used by Capitol in 1964 than the \\"Past Masters\\" true stereo mix does.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|While watching &#34;Shelter,&#34; a rather sweet-natured story about a good-hearted, self-sacrificing young man dealing with the realization that he might be gay, I was reminded of the the Otto Preminger film of 1962, &#34;Advise and Consent.&#34;  In it a young but influential senator, now happily married  and with a small child, had had sexual relations with a man while in military service who, now in poverty, is attempting to he commits suicide rather than suffer exposure, an effective if extreme solution to his problems.  CAUTION -- the next paragraphs contains spoilers to the plot of &#34;Shelter.&#34;contact the senator for money and threatening to expose his past. The senator becomes so distraught with the situation before him that   This film makes one realize the distance we have (hopefully) traversed in 50 or so years.  In &#34;Shelter&#34; an artistically gifted young man, Zach, played by Trevor Wright, is helping to support his sister and her little boy, Cody (Jackson Wurth), and their ailing father, and, as a result, has given up his hopes of attending an art academy.  Zach's boyhood friend, Gabe (Ross Thomas), who is straight, has an older brother, Shaun, (Brad Rowe), who had taught them both to surf a few years before and is known by his brother, Gabe, to be gay.  Shaun, who has returned to the area and is living at the family residence in a much nicer part of town,  reestablishes an acquaintance with Zach and a friendship begins to develop  between them.  As time goes on this becomes more than a friendship as Zach comes to terms with his sexual feelings and gradually falls in love with Shaun.  Zach's sister, Jeanne (Tina Holmes), is planning to leave the area with her dolt of a male friend and intends to leave her child in Zach's care for a considerable period.  Zach's relationship with Shaun becomes known to her and she initially doesn't want her child anywhere near Shaun, but gradually comes to realize that Cody, who is very attached to Zach and now to Shaun as well, would be better off under his and Shaun's care than with her and her male friend who isn't particularly fond of Cody.  The film ends with Zach, now having broken up with his girlfriend, Tori (Katie Walder), and his little nephew now living happily with Shaun who has seen to it that Zach will get to attend art school after all.  The film was skillfully written and directed by Jonah Markowitz.  The brief final scene of Zach, Cody and Shaun happily romping on the beach was apparently added some months after the film had been considered complete as both Trevor Wright and Brad Rowe are here seen having long hair.  The cast is generally excellent and the developing relationship portrayed between Zach and Shaun, a bit rocky at times due to Zach's uncertainty and hesitancy, being all the more captivating for that reason.  This is a dramatically and visually pleasing, well-made if rather short film about a character portrayed as being gay who does not necessarily end up as a victim of a mental breakdown, suicide or murder.  There are several scenes in this movie that are quite affecting, most notably the two scenes in which his two straight friends -- his ex-girlfriend, Tori, and his boyhood surfing buddy, Gabe  -- each in their way help put Zach back on the right track toward his relationship with Shaun, his obvious true love.  Zach is, of course, the central character of the story and all of the other characters are defined by their relationships to him. There is essentially no scene in the film in which Zach doesn't appear and the title could easily have been &#34;Zach's Story.&#34;  How the title of &#34;Shelter&#34; was chosen isn't exactly clear to me.  Trevor Wright and Brad Rowe, both straight actors, bring a degree of warmth and believability to their characters that is quite amazing.  Incidentally, in the commentary track, director Jonah Markowitz erroneously refers to the suspension bridge in San Pedro, shown several times in the film, as the Saint Thomas Bridge.  The correct name is the Vincent Thomas bridge.  UPDATE -- 7-11-14:  Well, I held off for as long as I could and finally gave in and bought into the imported region-free Blu-ray of &#34;Shelter.&#34;  I  had some trepidation.  &#34;Shelter&#34; was originally shot as a 16 mm negative, blown up to a 35 mm print, so I expected the possibility of seeing little improvement with Blu-ray.  Not so at all!  The improvement in detail and contrast is apparent from the first frame.  The sound is DTS optional for 5.1 and 2.0 stereo and is an improvement over the DVD version in that respect as well.  And there was no compatibility problem.  Only disappointment -- it doesn't include the commentary track available on the original.  But I have the DVD version tucked into the same case with the Blu-ray, so no big deal.  Worth every cent.
B001QB9H1A|1.0|I was a fan of Jason Statham before I knew he was even capable of athletic moves in action flicks.  His work in Guy Ritchie's \\"Snatch\\" and \\"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\\" had me thinking he was a pretty cool cat.  When I saw the first \\"Transporter\\", I thought even better of him.  The original film is all sorts of dumb, which I can handle if the action is well done and the flick has a good sense of \\"fun\\", and the original had that courtship down pat.  Part 2 was a definite drop in the action and plot department (ripping off 2004's \\"Man on Fire\\", itself a remake) but was still exciting and enjoyable.  3 has nothing going for it but a group of capable people completely wasting their time and talent.  Written by Luc Besson?!?  Action choreographed by Cory Yuen?!? I would've used a pseudonym, fellas: like Alan Smithee!  It's not Statham's fault this movie's so bad but would it kill him to be a little more selective in the roles he picks?  One more of these and another couple of \\"Crank\\" films and he'll find himself securely in Direct-to-Video hell.<br /><br />Frank Martin (Statham) is a transporter, taking anything anywhere for a price, under his strict conditions.  When he turns a job over to a friend of his and the dude fails, Frank is forced to complete the agreement himself.  He must drive a girl from Marseilles to Odessa with both of them restricted by electronic wrist tethers to a 75 ft perimeter around Frank's car or the tether will explode.  All in the hopes of getting the girl's father (a Ukrainian politician) to sign off on letting the bad guy's company dump several ships worth of toxic waste into the Black Sea.<br /><br />Again, I can handle dumb.  I would even go so far as to say that there's an art to it.  Unfortunately, Picasso ralphed all over the canvas! And what didn't slop onto the floor is not art, even in the most abstract sense!  The part that angers me the most is the fist-fighting.  In my opinion, everything else can be forgiven if the fights are good.  They are absolutely HORRIBLE!  Some of the sloppiest editing I have EVER seen on film!  None of Statham's atheleticism is shown without being shredded by quick cuts.  Good Hong Kong action will show several moves before changing angles and I don't think one full move was illustrated without interruption!  Epileptics beware!<br /><br />Bad plot involving environmentalism and ridiculously choppy martial arts sequences?  That sounds suspiciously like any number of Steven Seagal movies, doesn't it? In fact, I recently watched Seagal's \\"A Dangerous Man\\" (2009) and the fights in that were better!  A lot better!  What was I just saying about \\"direct-to-video\\"?  Wesley Snipes was a legitimate actor (and a good one) before he was typecast in action roles, too!<br /><br />The DVD I have (used and cheap, yet I still feel violated) has flip-disc full and widescreen presentation with no special features, and who would watch them anyway?  In English with optional Spanish subtitles.  This is to theatrically released action films what \\"The Serpent's Egg\\" was to Ingmar Bergman's repertoire!  Putting it slightly ahead of Joel Schumacher's 1997 stinker, \\"Batman and Robin\\"!  AVOID it, please!<br /><br />2008are absolutely HORRIBLE!

1601251505|5.0|This is the best revision to the Dungeons and Dragons game so far.  Options have been expanded and rules have been tweaked in a positive manner, consistent with the ongoing game mechanic.  Explanations of game mechanics are well worded and the artwork is simply inspiring. In addition, The book is simply huge and the amazon price makes it extremely affordable.<br /><br />If you have enjoyed Dungeons and Dragons 3.0/3.5 but are interested in a change, then this is it.  This is a rework built on the original system,  and not a completely different game system. (i.e. 4th edition)  My suggestion: If you have played D&D and enjoyed it, then buy this game. It will likely be the best core rulebook you have ever purchased.<br /><br />However, If you have played D&D and you hated it, then go buy 4th edition.  It seems to have been designed by people who shared the same opinion.

However, the first chapter was a bit slow because he introduced a handful of new characters. It was an extremely fast read for me and I loved it. Lots of surprises in store for the reader.
0679746323|4.0|Soon into the book you realize that this is not a stuffy History Channel recanting of Mao's legacy.  Jung Chang hates Mao, and is doing her best to get us to hate him too.  But who can blame her?  Mao and his cadres admit to killing millions.  It's just how many millions they squabble over.  Is it 1 million or 70 million? - up for debate.<br /><br />The book is thoroughly researched, though.  A good 80 pages at the end of the book is the bibliography and references; hundreds of interviews, documents, archives, etc.<br /><br />Also, Jung Chang's husband and co-author Jon Halliday, is an expert in Soviet Political history.  The uniquely soviet perspective is vital in studying this subject.
044654146X|4.0|This is a very readable and informative delivered with insight, analytical skills, and a just a little bit rose-tinted glasses. It covers a lot of ground into Israel's entrepreneurial successes and the causes behind it. When delving into the secret sauce, so to say, of Israel's success, the authors point out there is no secret mantra here, rather a congruence of several factors, cultural, geo-political, religious, and sheer happenstance that have combined over the decades. However, the book suffers a little by its lack of any detailed case study of a company or entrepreneurial success that would have lent the book academic heft.<br /><br />The author(s) also seem to be overawed by Israeli military prowess and success and spend a disproportionate amount of time documenting Israel's many military successes against its Arab neighbors. These details however do not end up fitting convincingly into the narrative. The theory put forward is intriguing for sure, and at least at face value looks convincingly. But a lot more is needed, by careful piecing of several of the pieces that could possibly make this puzzle. Which does not happen in the book.<br /><br />These two picayunes notwithstanding, this is a very engaging read. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Israel is a most unlikely country to be considered a successful breeding ground cutting-edge technology start-ups. Despite few natural resources, a population consisting almost entirely of immigrants, an ever-hostile neighborhood (like you wouldn't believe it), it has still managed to make a name for itself as a country where cutting edge technological innovations are churned out with amazing regularity, a place where technology behemoths like Intel and Google come to do cutting edge work.<br /><br />The authors do a commendable job of documenting and highlighting Israel's long road from its tumultuous creation in 1948 to its present day reputation. They look at several factors that explain its success - both because and despite of. The frankness of the Jews (\\"What is said about Jews--two Jews, three opinions--is certainly true of Israelis. People who don't like this sort of frankness can be turned off by Israel\\"), the military service that every adult goes through, the foresight of some of its early leaders like Ben Gurion and Shimon Peres in accepting the need for and funding the creation of a technology industry, the geo-political necessities (Arab nations enforced a trade boycott of Israel that continues even today - \\"Every government of the Arab League established an official Office of the Boycott, which enforced the primary boycott... According to Christopher Joyner of George Washington University, \\"Of all the contemporary boycotts, the League of Arab States' boycott against Israel is, ideologically, the most virulent; organizationally, the most sophisticated; politically, the most protracted; and legally, the most polemical.\\" \\") and the need to be independent of political allies that could not be relied upon - all play their part.<br /><br />Of all the factors identified and studied by the authors, the military is by far the biggest in their eyes. The fact that it is compulsory, that entry into its elite units is not only very competitive but also something desired on a resume, that military service is atypically non-hierarchical, where authority of even a general can be questioned by even the lowest ranking soldier, that it forces young people to learn to think on their feet and make critical decisions with less than perfect information - are skills that stand them in good staid in the corporate world. The authors however seem to be overawed by Israel's military successes, specifically the Six-Day War in 1967, and probably rush to attribute much of Israel's startup success to this military prowess. Notwithstanding Israel's military successes and famed intelligence services (Mossad), a credible defence of such a position would have required a much more detailed and exhaustive analysis than is offered up in the book. Comparative studies, longitudinal studies or references to such studies, and more is needed.<br /><br />  \\"While it's difficult to get into the top Israeli universities, the nation's equivalent of Harvard, Princeton, and Yale are the IDF's elite units. The unit in which an applicant served tells prospective employers what kind of selection process he or she navigated, and what skills and relevant experience he or she may already possess.\\"<br /><br />  ...<br /><br />  \\"Each year, the top 2 percent of Israeli high school students are asked to try out--two thousand students. Of these, only one in ten pass a battery of tests, mainly in physics and mathematics.\\"<br /><br />  ...<br /><br />  \\"Despite the military leadership's outreach, too few young Americans today feel any connection to their contemporaries in the military...\\"<br /><br />This potent combination of extreme selectivity and extreme desirability can also be seen in the premier Indian schools - Indian Institutes of Technology, and the Indian Institutes of Management. The IITs have had a remarkable run of success where literally thousands of engineers have gone on to found successful companies. Some illustrious names include Narayana Murthy and Nandan Nilekani (co-founders of Infosys), Ashok Soota (found of Mindree), Vinod Khosla (co-founder, Sun Microsystems), Suhas S. Patil (founder of Emeritus Cirrus Logic), Kanwal Rekhi (CTO, Novell), Krishna Bharat (creator of Google News), Amit Singhal (Google Fellow). These and hundreds of other IIT graduates have been very successful in creating value through technology startups.<br /><br />Perhaps a much better explanation of this desire and hunger and almost desperation to succeed can be explained by the socio-economic and geo-political contexts in which people grow up.<br /><br />This drive for technology in Israel is not restricted to computer software or hardware. There are numerous fields in which Israel has achieved notable success.<br /><br />  \\"Israel now leads the world in recycling waste water; over 70 percent is recycled, which is three times the percentage recycled in Spain, the country in second place.\\"<br /><br />  ...<br /><br />  \\"Intel Israel was responsible for designing the chip in the first IBM personal computers, the first Pentium chips, and a new architecture that analysts agree saved Intel from a downward spiral during the 1990s, as we chronicled in chapter 1.\\"...<br /><br />  \\"NICE Systems, the global corporation behind call-monitoring systems used by eighty-five of the Forbes 100 companies, was founded by a team of Talpions.

B003UESJH4|5.0|My husband and I saw this movie a month ago and enjoyed the story and the actors so much that we couldn't wait for it to be available on DVD.  Can you imagine my disappointment when I viewed the details and discovered there was NO closed caption?  There have been so many movies that we would have liked to buy but there  aren't closed captions.  Eliminating the cc really is unfair to so many people with hearing problems and if they can't be considerate of these people, one would think that money would induce these production companies to add closed caption.  In many cases the lack of cc prevents a spouse from buying the dvd out of consideration for the other party.  Shame on them!
1401310400|4.0|I've skimmed the other reviews and agree with most of them, so I don't have much to add, except despite all the obvious references and transparency to Castle and Beckett, and the sloppy proofreading, this is a very fun and engaging read. Look forward to reading Naked Heat once it's out in paperback. Love the show, love the books--long may this Castle reign--thanks to the inimitable NF!
1416550534|4.0|I enjoyed reading this novel as a period piece, a fascinating glimpse into the lives of Edwardian aristocracy.  The story moves quickly and is well-developed for the most part.  For all the author's attention to detail, though, I was disappointed in the not-so-tidy ending.  The idea for the climactic ending was a great one, but it is bothersome when all the threads are not tied neatly together for a complex, layered story such as this one.  SPOILER ALERT  The author never says at what point Grace realized what the final letter said, and this would have been pivotal to the events following Robbie's death and Grace's guilt which shaped the rest of her life.  I think Hannah would have quickly guessed or learned from Grace why her plan did not work, and the conversations/interactions between her and Grace immediately following Robbie's death would never have happened because either Grace would have been dismissed or would have left immediately out of guilt and shame.  While holding the letter to the last page is a nice touch, the final events of the story could have been better thought out.

B001BI6RCA|5.0|Ok then, i know its a bold statement to declare a record as being the greatest ever, but thats exactly what im going to do. First of all lets get one thing straight, just because im saying its the best album ever does not mean you will like it. The best album ever for you is the one that means the most. Personal preference is something that just cant be argued. However , i thought the best way to judge the best album ever is to put personal preference aside and simply examine the the entire albums contents as honestly as possible. I did this with a lot of records, im serious, it took me bloody ages. In the end the decision was easy, Sandinista by The Clash is the best album ever. I can hear you laughing at me now as you wonder how i came to this conclusion, well, here's how....First of all Sandinista breaks every rule there is to break when it comes to making an album. Its too long, the songs are in the wrong order, it remixes its own songs on the same album and The Clash liked one song so much they put it on there twice, only the second version is backwards. Its easy to see that the Clash were prepared to take risks and not bore us by repeating a musical formula that so many great bands seem to do a lot of. I can almost here Beatles fans now saying, what ? you think the beatles repeated themselves. Its ok Beatles fans, The White Album is second on my list of best albums ever. Well then , back to Sandinista. Its great to hear an album that hasn't spent to much time in the editing suite , producers tend to seek absolute perfection when it comes to mixdown and perhaps more often than not the magic was there right at the beginning. Sandinista was made in a very small space of time, just three weeks to record 36 songs and i can assure you when it comes to the way it sounds, it is magic. Ultimately its the songs that make a great album and whilst there is no big songs on this album ( what i mean by big is there are no songs that have become deeply entrenched into the human psych, like say All You Need Is Love is or Stand By Me, you get my jist) but the songs on Sandinista are delivered with such awe inspiring passion. The best way to describe Sandinista is that it is a record that starts out feeling like its to much, but after time, it seems like its never enough....... PS you should listen to this record on vinyl only as cd simply compresses out all of its richness.
B0021L8V0W|1.0|Salt DVD blu-ray was defective in that the sound cut out in same spot, even with replacement DVD. Amazon took return back without any problem.  My daughter then purchased the same Salt DVD without blu- ray at another store and it worked great. We did check our blu-ray machine and it works great with other dvd's.
B003HLM2QO|5.0|If you don't own this album, then buy it now!  This is Ozzy's top fourth of his career (No more tears, diary and blizzard being top 3).  Ozzy re-invents himself on every album and on this one he doesn't sell himself short.  \\"Let me hear you scream\\" speaks for itself and that's why he is nominated for a grammy.  The first 5 songs of this album are incredible, also Latimer's Mercy brings out the evil in Ozzy.  Pick up the tour edition if you can, the bonus tracks are good.  The bonus track \\"One more time\\" is amazing, it should have made the album cut.
B00001OH7Y|5.0|Rock magazines in the early 70s that had writers that thought they knew what songs meant by the lyrics, were wrong most of the time as it pertained to Bowie.  It's been almost 40 years of writers telling readers this or that.    The truth is, nobody knows.  If he toured in 1980 and had a swastika as a backdrop, would that mean he's a nazi?  Probably not with Bowie.  I know that's a hypothetical but what's real has been anylyzed to death, with a wide range of opinions, all are just guessing.  One truth is the music is great, and this might be one of the greatest records ever.  But the webpage says this is the last good Bowie album and the best he would do in the 80s.  He started recording it at the beginning of 1980, so that discounts evrything he did in the next ten years, and the 90s, and beyond.    Besides the flop, Never let me down (which was forced by the record company for a tour) every Bowie album is itself a work of art.  Let's Dance was a great album, not because it got commercial success, that's not what drove the recording because it hadnt happened yet.  Might have in 1987 though, and might be one of the reasons that didn't meet the levels of other recordings.    So he went into a band setting (tin machine) so he wasn't a solo artist making all the moves, a band bounces ideas.  He got it straightened out and continued on recording great material.  Black tie white noise, Outside 1 was spectacular, one of his best albums ever, and the last three (hours, Heathen, and reality) were all great albums.  The climate had changed, computers were entertainment instead of music.    One thing I think I can get a Bowie fan to agree on (there's some really heated discussions about this):  His good material gets better the more you listen to it (and the bad gets worse in the same way).    Most of David Bowie's recordings are great, and his bad ones, not too many, are better than any other solo artist could do.  You can't compare him to the rolling stones or the Beatles,because it was totally different.    The fans expected one thing, probably based on his last record, and didn't get it.  Take a step back,look at it as a whole.  Late 80s there was a gap.  Besides that, everything is solid.  Scary Monsters was better receieved as time went on, as opposed to Let's Dance, which was on the radio every half hour.  That kills a song more than anything in my opinion. Still a great song.
0446569895|5.0|The funniest book I've ever read.  You will be rolling on the ground, but what else would you expect from a god.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is a feel-good family show that can bring tears to the eyes of even the scrooge among us.  Everyone will enjoy it.
B00003CX9S|3.0|I would prob not recommend to watch this movie if your looking for something intresting I bought it so I can write a report rather than reading the whole book.
B000VPPMXO|1.0|Product did not work as advertised.  Unable to get useful responses from iRobot customer support.  Concluded that either the product is misrepresented or I received a defective unit.  Ended up abandoning them because iRobot did not respond effectively.    I really wish they had worked as shown in the videos, etc.      I'm not going to waste money on another set just hoping that I might get a couple that work.  Your mileage may vary.
0380973464|2.0|Cryptonomicon has come highly recommended by several people with (a) marginally scientific degrees who have, at best, a loose grasp of post calculus math (half of this country's engineering majors), or (b) a stated interest in science, but whose understanding goes about as far as what they read in Popular Science.  Indeed, that audience seems to have dictated the treatment of the technical concepts in the novel.  More than once, several pages are dedicated to lengthly explanation of concepts that could have been addressed in a paragraph; Stephenson appears to be writing for a fairly non-technical audience, which is disappointing considering the interesting subject matter.  The two basic plots are interesting and are great building blocks for the novel.  In particular, Stephenson takes advantage of enough eccentric historical figures that the comedy in the WWII section brought more than a few chuckles.   But, as has been previously observed, the modern storyline needs more relation to the historical one.  The two aspects which were most disappointing were Stephenson's handling of character development, and the stylistic and creative drop-off throughout the novel.  Characters begin as entertaining- if rather shallow- caricatures but emerge in the second half of the novel with entirely new personalities without warning or explanation!  This could be a symptom of the second issue: it seems as the pages go on, Stephenson just gets tired of writing it.  In the first third, the writing is thoughtful and engaging.  By the final third, I'm just waiting for it to end and wondering, what could possibly take up 300 more pages?  Nothing.  Nothing of substance fills those pages.  This was a really great idea for a book, and if the technical detail and latter half could be beefed up, it'd be interesting to see what would happen if Stephenson took another stab at it.  Really, I'm stunned at the high regard it seems to command, though this is almost certainly explained by the previously defined populations.  And it's not even close to being as overrated as garbage like The Da Vinci Code, which is generally recommended by an overlapping and analogous group.  If ol' Neal could hold his style steady for a few hundred more pages, we'd probably be looking at a five star work,  but unfortunately Cryptonomicon is a definite 2/5.
B004BBDHEK|4.0|This is a very good Yanni album and shows signs of some growth.    Much of the album sounds very \\"Yanni\\", but he has updated his sound with deeper bass lines and some synthesizer arpeggios here and there, and a few more modern tricks. It's not overdone and it works. He doesn't lose his signature sound admist all of this, which many artists do when they try this kind of thing.    It does take a few listens for the differences in the tracks to come through, and after a few times through some of the songs take on their own character.    There are a few tracks with vocals, and a few live instruments here and there, but it's mostly Yanni and the keyboards.    It plays a bit like a \\"best of\\" album, yet all of the tracks are new. There aren't any obviously bad tracks.    Definitely worth a try if you know you already like Yanni's music.
0307346617|5.0|This book is a perfect book to follow up The Zombie Survival Guide. The layout is easy to read and keeps the reader's interest peaked as it talks about how the Zombie War took over the world. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for an interesting twist on the end of the world.
0670022411|5.0|I love it when you find a new author and you can't put the book down.  You know you are going to love the book when you find yourself, halfway through, wishing that you did not have reach the end.  The mixture of science, history, witches, vampires and daemons is irresistable.  In addition, I am now inspired to visit Oxford...Salem...Lyons....
0316098337|3.0|Why did I entitle this review \\"Punishing to read\\"?...Because that is exactly how it is.  Ma and Jack are trapped in \\"the Room\\" for so long and have been since before Jack was born.  Old Nick is responsible for it all but we never hear from him except by Ma's rare descriptiions.  I found I had to read on while, at the same time, draading what might happen next and realizing that it would be, in real life, extremely unlikely that Ma and Jack could have survived through their confinement.  I only gave a 3 star rating because the reader must read on to find just how in the world this story is going to end while, at the same time, wishing the action could move faster.
0345350499|5.0|I have owned this book for years, and it is still my all time favorite.  I am a huge mythology fan in general, and I love the Arthurian Legends, and this book is by far the best retelling of that story in existence.  I love the way it is written, the way the story is told from the feminine perspective (for once!), and the depth and complexity of the characters and plot.  By the time I finished reading this book for the first time, I felt like I knew the characters personally.  They are so complete and Bradley really goes in depth with their personalities and shows them to be just as complex as real people are.  The journey you go on while reading this story is magical and fascinating.  True, you do have to get through about 100 pages of not-quite-so-captivating groundwork to lay the foundation of the story, but once you push through that bit, you will not be able to take your eyes from the pages!
B001J32H6M|5.0|I had the original, minimal soundtrack for \\"Temple of Doom\\" on cassette when I was a kid.  I never understood why they didn't release it on CD, so this is a welcome treat!  Almost twice the music that was on the original.  Some of my favorite themes from any of the Indy movies.  Great stuff!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me. I didn't think i was goimg to like it because it was so dark. as soon as I got into the second chapter I was obsessed with finishing it.  It was one of the best books I've read since the Harry Potter series. My complements to Suzanne Collins.  I can't wait to start the second book!!!
B003NFM3JK|5.0|I saw it in 3D when it first came out at the movie theater & i liked it so much i pre-ordered it when it came out on DVD.  I don't think it's for kids though, maybe teens and grown-ups. Jim Carrey is great!
1416550534|3.0|Elderly Grace, once a housemaid in Edwardian England, is reliving her past (a la \\"Water for Elephants\\" or \\"Thirteenth Tale\\"), which includes ties to two sisters (Hannah and Emmeline) in the family she served, as her mother before her served. Overall, it's a fairly interesting socio-historical novel, though I felt it was the eensiest bit slow getting started. A filmmaker comes to ask Grace about her time at Riverton House, where a famous poet committed suicide and was seen by the 2 sisters. Over time, Grace relates her memories of the family she served, her own life (which seemed far more interesting) and as she leaves us, she relates the truth of what happened between the sisters and the poet. Verdict: a solidly good read, if a bit slow to begin.
B00000J5Z6|3.0|This is a pleasant enough recording, but has nowhere near the emotion of the originals. Much like the elevator-music reviewer, I find it only a pleasant diversion - but that in itself makes it mostly worthwhile.  My main reason for writing this at all is that if you search \\"SACD\\" in Amazon, this comes up as an SACD. It most definitely is not, and I think the DSD logo on the label has some confused. It is advertised as recorded in DSD, and then down-sampled to CD. So, you get a CD. You can't stuff 24 bits into 16 without losing the resolution that makes 24 bits better. Just enjoy it for what it is, but that's all you get.
0670022411|5.0|An exciting new world.....  Throw away everything you know about mystical vampires, witches and yes, demons....  Very refreshing book intermingling old vampires and DNA research.....  Not a spoiler, but this book doesn't end as a complete storyline, very clear there will be more to come... I can't wait...!
1401324029|4.0|I really liked this book better than the first. It felt like deja vu especially at the beginning, since Richard Castle puts elements from the show into the book. But all in all I really did enjoy the story and the romance between Rook and Heat. I love that Castle!!!
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|This is an amazing and unique Blu-Ray. Evangelion is for a long time one of the most seen anime in Japan and maybe in the World. This rebuild shows us how Evangelion should be made from beginning. This is the Ultimate Version so far(even though I think it can't get any better). This is a must buy.
B002HK9I04|5.0|The movie is timeless. The music is sensational and addictive. It is broadway material (an adaptation that would certainly have age restrictions). It is horribly offensive but worth it in every way. Everyone should see it more than once and truly pay attention to the details.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is one of the best films of our age , warm, loving, I initially had a problem playing the disk that cleared up and the sellers were VERY helpfull and answered my report promptly.
