1454901276|5.0|Summary:<br />Edinburgh, Scotland Detective Fin MacLeod is sent to The Outer Hebrides---Isle of Lewis. The Isle of Lewis is located northwest of the Isle of Skye, and both are off the west coast of Scotland. It is always windy on the Isle of Lewis.<br /><br />  \\"That tireless assault blowing in across three thousand miles of Atlantic. Beyond the shelter of Stornoway harbour there was barely a tree on the island.\\"<br /><br />There's been a murder in the village of Crobost. Ironically Crobost is the town of Fin's birth. The craggy Gaelic people will not all be pleased with his return, many will be shocked. He's been gone 18 years. People change. Yet, life on Isle of Lewis has changed little.<br />During the investigation Fin will have to face the events from his past. No longer can he ignore them.<br /><br />My Thoughts:<br />I loved this story! Let me say that again. I love this story! I want to back up and re-read it. Instead I think I'll look for more books from this author.<br />What I loved about this story:<br /><br />  The authors writing style is fluid, smooth, relaxing. I settled back comfortably in my reading chair from the first page until the last. Although the fluid writing style is polar from the storyline and characters; with both a murder to solve and painful unresolved memories from the past---Fin's character as well as all the other characters are dark and dreary and they drape heavily upon each page.<br />  The Isle of Lewis came alive for me in my mind. I could easily picture the wind-swept coast, the churning pounding white foam against the rugged rocks, the hard-working people, Gaelic demeanor and language, and the village of Crobust trying hard to become adaptable to modern times.<br />  The story tied-in and finished well. I was not completely surprised by the chain of events, but was surprised by who was the murderer, as well as the finality.<br /><br />I want to point out the main character Fin MacLeod is antagonistic towards Christian's. Reading between the lines so to speak. I believe his lack of belief was because of his atheist aunt, tragedy from his childhood, tragedy from his current life, a longing for something more, and unresolved buried memories. At no point was I put-off by his candor. Instead I was amazed at his transparency. Fin is a character that is real, not a hero, but a real man with a multi-faceted personality, and with grim memories, like all of us.ding between the lines so to speak.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|That word ^^ is one that will be etched onto your heart forever, after you read this book. You'll see why, I promise. This book was so emotionally deep, and so real. It left me in tears, and I can proudly say, I am in love with Augustus Waters (:

B005LAIH9A|5.0|Awesome and hilarious movie.<br />Once you see this movie. You have to see the rest that is in the series.<br />This will probably be the last movie they make I suppose.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Indispensable, relentless in its grip. Read this book far into the night. Was drawn to the believable character and rooting for her.
B00BF11STU|5.0|What a powerful movie. It deserves much recognition and praise for what they were able to achieve. Bravo! Two more words.
0385535147|4.0|I wanted to provide this review while it is fresh in my mind. I bought the book on Friday and finished it by Monday night. It is typical Grisham stuff. Some suspense but then the ending became a little confusing or perhaps unrealistic.<br /><br />Regardless of the reviews posted here, I would still read it however it doesn't compare to some of his other works.<br /><br />Towards the end I was anticipating something going wrong in their plans but nothing exciting ever happened. It almost seemed too easy for the main character to pull this scheme off. Making for a more then usual dry ending.<br /><br />Enjoy your read!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Daniel Craig is a great Bond, and the combination of him, a great story, fantastic editing, and strong performances from Javier Bardem, Judi Dench, and the new Q make this movie worth a watch.
B009R9WB34|5.0|I mainly like the cd for the notorious Diamond song.<br />I've heard the song many times on the radio and didn't know who sang it until I did some seaching.<br />That's the only song I like. The remix is the best.

B009FZHYKU|3.0|The first half of season 3 was great but the last half was boring. Started to get better in the final two episodes, so hopefully season 4 is worth the wait!

B000FA5TTW|2.0|Started good, got slow, read till the end to see if they caught the suspect. I just finished. Way too much flashback that got VERY confusing and irratating.
0425263908|3.0|Some say this series is better than Fifty Shades, and I'm sorry to say....not true.  Gideon doesn't seem to learn from the errors he makes, and in this book the reader never learns what trauma he endured to make him the way he is. Eva, too, always seems to be running away.  Not very mature, no matter what trauma she endured as a young girl.  And I'm not at all crazy about the \\"mouth\\" on Eva.  No real woman has to talk with all the foul language and sex words to be alluring.  Maybe younger women do, these days, but not a truly classy woman talks like that.  The story never goes anywhere, either.  This is my first volume in the series, so perhaps I'm coming in, in the middle of the fray, because it surely doesn't stand alone. Don't they have any sweet, slow, smooth sex in these stories?  The 'event\\" in this book always seemed so fast and furious.  I think the writing is stilted and always headed towards the sex.  No big company would allow the CEO to come on to a young woman her first day on the job, even if he owns the company.  At any rate, I am not taken enough with the writing to check out the other books in the series.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Wreck It Ralph is a movie where this bad guy named Ralph (Who lives in the game Fix It Felix JR.) wants to be a good guy so he does all of these crazy things just for what? A medal!?!?! Crazy, right? And here is the worst part, he almost gets his game unplugged and that means everyone dies when that happens. It came out in theaters on Nov. 2nd, 2012. It is an adventure and action movie. It is also a clay-mation movie.<br />Wreck It Ralph is an action and adventure movie because they race and because Ralph goes turbo (You will have to watch the movie to see what that means) and because Ralph goes into this shooting game. The shooting game is cool because you shoot these robot bugs called psy bugs who are robots and are very, very, VERY dangerous!<br /> Clay-mation makes this movie better because it looks better and cooler.<br />And that is why I think you should watch Wreck It Ralph.

B000U0O9FM|5.0|I learned the America with this book - I am Russian myself, so it was very enlightening. The way author writes it, you are the story, you feel those fists against your face, you taste the salt of busted lips. And you also enthrilled with whole story of travel through the states and the deeds that were done to rebel against stale living of the society.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|Works on kindle fire HD 8.9 without problems so far. I've had it a few weeks now and does wake me up! This is an easy to use clock, with multiple alarm settings with snooze, sound choices , looks and color choices and much more. It has the features of either snooze button, solve a math problem or enter in a somewhat code to turn off the alarm. The last one works well to finally wake me. The increasing volume is a big help. I use several throughout the day. There are quite a few music choices built-in. I think you can set your own tunes but I haven't tried that yet.  The stop watch xtreme was added (by Developers prompt) after a few days and installed.  It streamlined into this program easily.  I have tried several others alarm clocks but this one is my favorite.  I'd recommend this one and you can't beat the price!  Get this app try it, you have nothing to lose.

B001DD0HPG|5.0|Julian Bream is perhaps the greatest classical guitarist of the modern era. His influence on audiences and players has eclipsed even that of Segovia. This set collects ten of his LP albums including original cover art for each one. The playing is exquisite and the range of color, style and technique is jaw-dropping. The repertoire covers the centuries from Bach to Britten. If you have only one classical guitar recording in your collection, make sure it's this fabulous set.

B00BG5CXGM|3.0|It's a great looking case but has some negatives which makes this case just ok. It is definitely heavier than I would've liked. The fact it says SLIM would make you think it was light which it is not. Also the back is very slippery and scratches easily. If this case were cheaper I would have no complaints. The fact it was just recently bumped up in price and with all the issues I described I would definitely not buy this case again.

B009DTI3FS|1.0|Anna Netrebko, Piotr Beczala, and Nino Machaidze, are at the top of my list as singers/performers. One would hardly expect that these three superstars would congregate to put out such a shoddy product.  The best the promoters can say about this DVD is \\"This Boheme was the talk of the 2012 Salzburg Festival....\\"  I can imagine what the talk was about.  So much for Salzburg!  I borrowed this DVD, and I am not buying it.  Stick with La Scala, the Met, or the ROH.  The odds are far better.<br /><br />The Boheme to get is the one from La Scala, starring Cristina Gallardo-Domas, Marcelo Alvarez, and Franco Zeffirelli. It is excellent in every aspect: vocally, artistically, and technically.  Cristina is fabulous.  Thanks to Amazon, the price is unbeatable.  One cannot afford not to buy it.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I have always been a fan of Lincoln, but I went into this movie very sceptical. Now a days Hollywood changes the truth about our history. I was over joined by how well done it was, and how they stayed with the truth! Many people try to think of Lincoln as a Democrat, well he was a Republican. The truth was the Democrats didn't want the slaves freed. Thank you, Steven Speilburg for keeping our history accurate in this movie.<br /><br />The acting was awesome, I was so moved and amazed by the whole picture. It kept me interesed through the whole movie. I highly reccommed this picture. You might want to watch it twixce because it is so good.

B0036BK6MW|5.0|Media today portrays American society as degrading and decaying; news media especially. It covers poverty and negative aspects because they sell better; they don't show positive aspects as much. The media makes it seem like the government is corrupt and the people are horrible to each other and the world is going to end. To contrast this mainstream media, the director of The Blindside wanted to share one boy's success story with the world as an uplifting illustration of the goodness that still exists in the world; by showing the positive aspects that still exist in individuals. In the movie The Blindside, the director addresses three social issues to effectively portray to people of all ages the potential and goodness that still exists in humanity: poverty and charity, racism and stereotypes, and the definition of a family.<br />The director addresses the issue of poverty and charity through the characters to reveal human decency. One example of this human decency is when Leigh Anne Tuohy, played by Sandra Bullock, provides a home for Michael Oher and accepts him into her family. She decides to drop by his mother's house in the ghetto of the city so that Michael can go collect his things. The people who live there are poverty-stricken, and Michael arrives at his mother's house to find that she had been evicted and had disappeared. When he comes back to the car empty-handed, Leigh Anne drives to the nearest clothing store and lets him pick out some new clothes. She was under no obligation to do so; as a mother she had a lot of other responsibilities as well. Not many people would have taken the time out of their lives to drive all the way to the other side of town for Michael, nor would they have wanted to spend their own money on new clothes for him. This selfless act is one of many committed by Leigh Anne Tuohy that illustrates the kindness and charity that continues to exist in humankind.<br />Another instance that demonstrates Leigh Anne's generosity and kindnessis when Michael asks her if he can get a driver's license. When she wants to know why, he simply responds `it's something to carry, with my name on it.' She ends up tracking his mother down, so that she can gather the papers they need to acquire a license and so that she can let his mother know how Michael is doing. After talking for a few minutes, his mother admits that she doesn't have his birth certificate, nor does she remember what his father's last name is. She then starts to cry, but instead of leaving, Leigh Anne sits next to her and comforts her. She tells her that Michael will always be her son, but that she is going to take care of him for her. Going through the long process of gathering the information she needed for Michael's driver's license was not an easy thing to do; nor was finding the courage to go and talk to his mother. Leigh Anne didn't have to do this either; she could have very easily told Michael that it was a lot of work to track down his past, and that she would rather not take the time to do it. This gesture of charity and love not only changed Michael's life, but the life of his mother as well.<br />The second issue the director addresses to illustrate the fact that positive aspects of society still exist is racism and stereotypes. After Michael has been living with the Tuohys for a while; Leigh Anne goes out to brunch with her friends and asks them what they know about the projects on the other side of town. They all make jokes about it and the people who live there, but when Leigh Anne doesn't laugh they ask her why she is so interested. She mentions Michael to them, and there is a mix of reactions among them. Her sister, however, questions Leigh Anne's decision; she wants to know how her daughter feels living under the same roof as a large, black boy. Leigh Anne just stares at her sister for a second before replying \\"shame on you.\\" She then gets up and leaves, picking up the check on her way out. Her reaction to this racism is reassuring, because it shows people everywhere that race doesn't matter. Leigh Anne Tuohy didn't see a scary, troublesome black kid. She saw a seventeen year old boy in need of help, and she took the opportunity to do so. Many of us tend to judge people of other ethnicities based on the stereotypes associated with them. We can learn a lot from Leigh Anne and the way she treated Michael Oher.<br />There is another moment in the movie where stereotypes are overcome, when Michael takes SJ out to go buy a video game. They get distracted by the radio as they are driving down the road, and Michael ends up crashing the car. SJ was sitting in the passenger seat, and the crash was bad enough to set the airbags off, which should have killed him. Michael, however, managed to get his arm in front of the airbag and stop it before it hit SJ. Leigh Anne gets a call in the middle of a meeting and comes rushing to the scene, but she is more concerned than angry. She checks on SJ, who is hurt but not severely, and then goes over to talk to Michael. Leigh Anne had more than enough reason to get mad at Michael; he should have been paying attention, but he was also the one who saved SJ's life. Instead of getting angry, she makes sure he is okay and tells him that it could have happened to anyone. Her reaction of patience and understanding is a good example for us in times when our patience may be tested. We need to remember that bad things can happen to anyone, and that our understanding and compassion will go a lot further than anger ever will.<br />The final issue addressed by the director to display the potential of humanity from The Blindside is the definition that the movie gives to the meaning of family. The goodness in the world comes from the structure of family; they make you who you are. One of the main concepts that can be taken from the movie is the fact that family is not always defined as the people you were born with. Family is the people you surround yourself with. In the caseof Michael Oher, he was born into some rough living conditions, and he managed to get out of the situation and join a new family with the help of Leigh Anne Tuohy. This is an important issue to address because there are a lot of arguments going on in society today about the definition of families, and what the parameters of one entail. The movie gives family a whole new meaning; it shows us that family is the people you love and care about more than the home you were born into. Leigh Anne was willing to welcome a complete stranger into her home, and she never expected anything in return. The Tuohy's, in turn, ended up gaining a new family member, and Michael Oher's life was changed for the better. That is what family should be about.<br />The Blindside is a movie that goes to great lengths to restore our faith in the goodness and potential of humanity. Three important social issues are brought up throughout the film; the director does a great job at showing these issues as they are in real life, and does even better at teaching his audience how these things can be overcome. We would do well to keep Leigh Anne Tuohy's attitude in mind as we go about our lives; when told by one of her friends that she was changing Michael Oher's life, she simply responded, \\"No, he's changing mine.\\"
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|best submarine movie ever. even though it was subtitled i felt i new every word that was spoken. Tremendous acting and excellent story. i was a long movie, but one i could not stop watching
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Since I found out the releasing of the DVD I pre-ordered the package but then I noticed it was another item where you receive Blu-Ray + DVD + Digital Copy + 2 hopping Eggs and omg I knew it was one of the most wonderful things. You can watch this movie in all the formats! And you have a little gift that it's totally worth it.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|This is a wonderful story with great characters and an inspiring story.  Loved the music and it is wonderful to see the hand drawn animation again...it does make a difference.  Enjoy!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|If you haven't seen the Sons then try to catch season six starting on September 6th on FX at 9:00 p.m. you will not be disappointed. You may have to order the first five seasons then.
B006I1OB0U|5.0|If you haven't seen the Series, I recommend it.  I get credit for a Chick Flick, and the story is great.  Wife loves it, and I enjoy the benefits.  Christmas Special was really something.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The movie did not stray too much from the book, but I highly recommend reading the book first as you can predict.<br />This is such a creatively written novel that will keep you glued to the pages. The way the author writes the voice of Pat is undeniably perfect.
B004G600A4|5.0|Great Disney movie...love the characters and the story.  I miss the hand drawn animation but enjoyed this interpretation of Rapunzel.
0790743132|3.0|Bought this movie for my husband.  He has passed away and I don't know where the movie has gone, but I never watched it
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was an amazing follow-up to the first book. I can't describe how it left me by the seat of my pants...q
B006LSZECO|4.0|Interesting the way the story is laid out.  She tells her story, he tells his, and it goes  like that throughout the entire book.  It was actually one of those books I could not put down.  Until the end .... hated the ending!  But I won't spoil it for anyone.
B000FA675C|5.0|There are no words in the dictionary to express what I was feeling as I was reading this book!  I could not put it down.  I actually felt a huge loss when I finished reading it.  I wanted it to go on forever.  I have read it three times and will read it again!  I feel so grateful that Dan Brown, a writer of such high caliber, not only decided to delve into history to find out the truth, but to have written the book for all of us.  By us, I mean those like myself who has known from a very young age that there was more history, life and &#34;Truth&#34; than what I was being taught.  Anyway, I believe in God and the Universe being a crucial part of my life and existence.  As far as what happened 2,000 years or so ago, well, my views are as Dan Brown writes about in his book; The Da Vinci Code.  I've read all the other books written by Dan Brown and loved them all!  I am looking forward to his new book coming out in May.<br /><br />I respect everyone's believes and religions and believe in &#34;Live and Let Live&#34;.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br />E.L
0385508417|5.0|One of my favorite books.  I bought many copies so I could give them to people when I was talking about the book due to criticism of the way we celebrate our Christmas Holiday in this day and age.
B0094K1QR8|3.0|I think it was a cute movie but too much foul language.  It would have been better without the bad language.  I liked the plot and the story was good
B0089AD8IO|5.0|This is one of my favorite series of all time and this is the introduction to the modern remake of the series. Christopher Eccleston is brilliant as the Doctor and Billie Piper as Rose the companion sets the scene for space time travel adventures! If you liked the classic series then you will love this!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|if you are horse.lover you will love this game but if you Re notary horse lover then this gamebmight be for you if you try it also best game ever duhhh
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Finally the two ofgthem sre allowed to expand their rolls. Moist enjoyable and it has set predence for more to come.
B000PAAJYW|5.0|I prefer movies that deal with relationships & this fits the bill for me. It is an older movie, but vey engrossing. There are separate vignettes that deal with situations in in the lives of people in this movie. I recommend it highly for those that prefer this type of movie also. I am definitely going to watch it again soon.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|Used with the Aluminum Short Dual 1.0 inch Socket Arm and Universal X-Grip Phone Holder. It was a cinch to install and it secures well.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Classic Tina Fey ... interesting insights into SNL - intelligent, funny, sharp ... She writes as well as she performs
B003THHIEM|5.0|best of all has to be the opening show where all the main characters are shown..... I have it i n my Kendle and must have watched it  a dozen  or more times with more to come.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|No major issues.  Very entertaining.  Would be nice if you could use it while not on WiFi though.  But other than that very fun indeed.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|Amazing movie; great action, drama, comedy and especially heart. Definitely watch the extended version. The extra 20+ minutes is as good as the rest.
B00820N2JG|5.0|Let me start by saying that I love South Park. This movie is much like a long episode of South Park ,but with puppets. Tons of satirical humor and cliche'd characters. They are just as hard on the U.S. as they are on the terrorists when making fun either. And to top it off you get to witness the very best softcore sex scene EVER FILMED between two puppets ! As a side benefit the A/V production values are top notch as well as some very lavish live action set. Just good unclean adult fun.
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|Listening to the score for \\"Oblivion\\", there is no doubt that Hans Zimmer could rightly feel ripped-off by the several sound-alike pieces so akin to his outstanding Batman soundtrack trilogy. Yet, the redoutable M83 tunesmiths also give us many fresh, fascinating, and firey movements. This can especially be found within the Deluxe/Extended edition available elsewhere in a thirty-song download version. A definite contender for a March 2014 oscar, the power and scope of M83's epic music sets a high expectation bar for the film itself to match.
1582701709|5.0|Not only is this book amazing, but the price was reasonable for it. And it came in a good condition, so I am very satisfied!
B004ADH1RI|5.0|A great adventure movie involving kids that don't always fit in but do have dreams of making things better and believing in the past!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Great message; I would recommend this women (and men) of all ages. It was very easy to get into and a quick read.  Highly recommended.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|, but a full album at one rime is a bit much for me.  Beat is too monotonous.  Does it come in a none dance version?
B0047Y0FGY|1.0|I do not find her particularly funny - it was a very boring read - do not know why I bought it.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|How often do you get excited about a piece of technology that performs a standard function that we are all already used to? I'm certain at this point that if you've been around computers you've seen multiple USB hubs. I used to think they were all pretty much the same. That is until I received my Anker 4-port USB 3.0 Hub. This little guy actually had a few tricks up its sleeve.<br /><br />  It was compact enough to be easily transported but rather than cramming all of the ports onto one side and expecting you to force your cables or flash drives into such a cramped space, it had one port per side. This may sound simple but it gave ample room for anything you choose to connect. Even if it's that geektastic animated flash drive with the cute little, well you know, attached. The next thing that I noticed since it is USB 3.0 it is fast. I attached my USB 3.0 to SATA adapter to it and an old SATA drive from my closet and transferred gigabytes of data at a very reasonable transfer speed.<br /><br />  I own several Anker products and I continue to be surprised by the quality of them and even the design of the packaging they come in is slick. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend these to a friend. With how limited USB 3.0 ports tend to be even on new computers this device really increasing the number of high speed devices you can attach. Also, How many reasonably priced devices come with over a year warranty anymore? You are lucky to get 90 days on most of them.<br /><br />  The only thing to keep in mind is that this hub is powered by the USB port on the computer. In other words, it is \\"self powered\\" - all this means is that you can't attach devices that draw a lot of power from the ports alone. However, for me this isn't an issue all of the devices that I have that draw more power have their own power adapters with them. I suspect if you look, you will find the same thing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My favourite game. I play this on everything except I cant get it on my phone so that really bothers me but other than that its amazing
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Well it was great movie. Acting was great. Suspend had you on the edge of your seat at all times.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|No problems with this order at all and i love the music. The CD made a great birthday gift and was much appreciated.
B000FA675C|2.0|I downloaded it because it was free, and I've always meant to read it, since it caused such a stir with its release. But, honestly, it was predictable, dull and took a while to get past the exposition.
B0091REZMW|4.0|little repeative. fun. you need to make friends in game to complete many of the tasks. good time waster without trying to require too much commitment.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|I didn't enjoy the movie one bit. Don't how won so many awards. I didn't like the actors or anything about.
B000FA675C|5.0|All of the books in the series are excellent but DaVinci Code is the best of them,<br />Poorly portrayed on the screen. Read the book and be thrilled.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Beautifully produced and acted! Love the period costumes and the storylines. I started at the beginning with Season 1, and haven't been able to quit watching!
B00BU2SIW4|5.0|I have been a fan of Depeche Mode since I heard &#34;Enjoy the silence&#34;. I love the sounds of this new album and the combination of David Gahan and Martin L. Gore voices. Highly recommended.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|at first I thought it was going to be a rip of but I ended up really loving this game after a while it seems boring and then fun again but this game is awesome
B004WR125O|3.0|This thing would've been completely awesome had it worked. I installed it, seems to be picking up wireless signals okay, not sure if it's a problem with the wireless adaptor or the receiver, either way I don't have wireless so a waste of $$
B008HK3XOU|5.0|It should have a holder for a stylus  That way you don't misplace the stylus  Other than that, it' great.
B005UKJZ10|2.0|What was up with the LSD inspired shots of the world being created?  A couple minutes of that would have been weird and a distraction.  For it to go on endlessly was nothing more than a bad joke on everyone who hung in there hoping for something to tie it all up.  A good basic story and some very good performances ruined by Brad Pitt's narcissistic attempt at film noir, where he was out of his league.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|exactly what I was looking for. awesome to fall asleep to. wide variety . and the selections are perfect. love this app
B0030SZ2D4|4.0|The collection of sci fi effects and darkness brings new meaning to terror after the suns set. Combine that with Van Diesel and you have a classic.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars but It's to modern for my taste.  Not good to watch with grandchildren.
B007P3S1AQ|1.0|Maybe if I had read the book I would have appreciated it more.  I expected to be moved by a story about a family being devasted by 9/11 and just got a fairly tedious portrayal of a weird kid.
B000G6R7B8|4.0|This is a nice looking watch and the photos don't do it due justice. I like machinery a lot, in spite of it running a &#34;little bit&#34; fast (read other reviews to find out how much; I am not interested in doing as thorough an analysis as others have done - I don't care if it gains a couple of minutes in a week.) What I didn't know was a feature was that the days of the week come in TWO languages: English and Spanish. Once you select one language for the day of the week you set, it will advance keeping the same language. Another interesting point to me was the font color of the days of the week: black for the work days, green for Saturday, and red for Sunday. This was a very nice design decision. I was confused looking at various pictures around the web that showed days with different colors, but now, the mystery is solved.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is the best book of the hero's of Olympus but I think that the house of Hades will be better because they left you hanging
B000QCS8TW|5.0|An honestly entertaining read, expertly crafted although too vague in its conclusion. Martin is a master first-person storyteller and does a great job of tying various threads together through compelling character development. Time to start book 2!
B003UBTX7C|4.0|From the first page to the last page Hell's Corner is a page turner. Intriguing plot, that takes Oliver Stone and his Camel Club friends down misleading trails platted by a challenging  villain that keeps the reader guessing until the last chapters.
B005VO6MYS|5.0|I always resented the fact that the content that would have fit in a single CD used to be sold as two-CD pack. It was a great opportunity to swindle buyers out of extra cash and it worked on people who remembered that it used to be two records, when it was distributed in vinyl. Now that the price is fair for digital content, I finally went for it. After a couple of listens, I almost regretted waiting so many years to buy this again in a different format: it was a very often played record that I had chosen to boycott, but here it is. I love it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loved it from the very first episode and watch all 3 seasons in a period of two weeks.  Can't wait to see what season 4 will bring!
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|The CD came in a timely manner and in good shape.  And it is one of the best romantic blues albums I have ever heard.  I love Cohan's singing voice and the choices on songs.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I found them by listening to The Civil Wars on Pandora radio. Like the folk sound  I like them not ads much as The Civil Wars. But I do like their blend.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I recommend this app for old and young. It is relaxing to sit back and take care of the horses.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|Funny and touching.  Very much appreciated his candor and insight into his own life and mind.  Love him on the Late, Late Show.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is one of the best games that I've played in a long time.  As good as Bejeweled Blitz!!  I am totally addicted!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|IT WILL LEAVE YOU HANGING .  I  founded that IT was hard to put down every time I thought I new IT switched up on me . So you might like the story.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Nail biting experience. Wasn't expecting it to end the way it did.  I can't wait for the sequel.  I will definitely go to see it.
0385493622|5.0|accessible to the layman, appendix has math that can be understood by anyone with a high school education.  book is a detective.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|As a fan of both the Hobbit tale and the Lord of the Rings from it's original writing, I looked forward to the presentation on the big screen.  As this is a somber tale filled with Elves, Wizards, Dwarfs, and Hobbits,plus Dragons and Orckes and Trolls,one can only begin to appreciate the visual effects brought to life on the screen.  As a prequel to the Lord of the Rings tale, you get to see the beginning of the evil in this tale.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|This is one of the best cds I have ever listened to! Every song is amazing. I highly recommend buying it.
B000OIZUW6|5.0|If you like Ken Follett, you'll love this book - it's fascinating and holds your attention - a good read...
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Lots of violence, somehow didn't capture my interest as I expected.<br /><br />The second half was better, a little more exciting. They should have reduced the first hour to about 15 minutes.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|If the movie is exactly like the book I will love it.  Could not put it down stayed interesting the whole time.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|We have Temple Run Now Temple Run 2!!! Love them both and they are free ! ARE U KIDDING ME!! From 4yr old to Grandparent we are fans!!!!!
B009CG2YDE|4.0|Unfortunate Overall A Great Little Game To Bring Back Old Memories. Instructions Are Unclear At First Though. I Haven't Gotten To Where In Game Purchases Are Needed But That Is Unfortunate If True
B003E2UQMS|4.0|Its a nice book i love the story and it was really nice reading it after watching the movie!<br />The only think I didn´t like was the ending of it because i expected a little more pasion!
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|This book is the best I've read in a long time and I read a lot. The most authentic loss of virginity scene and then back to fantasy because it is a romance novel.
0743455967|1.0|Mr. King, one of the most popular writers ever, threw this together as he was convalescing from his auto accident.  He warns us up front, this is not a &#34;how to write a best seller&#34; manual, in fact, it is not a &#34;how to write&#34; manual.  It is mostly his reminiscing, but that's okay, just not on my time.

B007TKT2SK|5.0|this calculator helps me with math and sometimes just in my everyday life like at restaurants or at the bank
B000RHKARY|5.0|This is an important addition to my collection: like many at the time I was fooled by noisier people like--dare I say--the Rolling Stones to pay attention to the true professionals. Mick Taylor was right to observe that the RS struck him as unprofessional when he went to the first rehearsal.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|at first I had heard about it i thought it was dumm but then I got the 2 temple run omg mii head exploded not Bc it was awesome on a ipod but Bc it was on mii kindle fire so I'm now addicted to it :):):) when u have the chance get it!!!!!!
B001JOIEZ4|5.0|I never really pay much attention to the music IN the movies I watch, but when a friend of mine had this Twilight soundtrack playing on her iPod, I found myself really enjoying the music.  I don't normally buy soundtracks as there always seems to be numerous lousy songs littering the album with only 1-3 decent songs mixed in.  This soundtrack is great from beginning to end and is a great listen!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Peter Jackson has chosen an incredible cast - each member who fits their role perfectly.  The direction of the movie is great and the story is wonderful.  I have loved &#34;The Hobbit&#34; since I was a teenager and I find that the liberties Jackson took are small and only help make the story more visual!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|My family and I love Downton Abbey and with our new DVD's we can watch whenever we wish.  Perhaps we will have a movie night and invite friends. Very happy with service I recieved.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Well written, interesting and fun to read. The commentary on the US prison system is amazing. The plot twists are great.
0385341008|5.0|As soon as I finished it, I started over - so that I could savor the story and notice the details that I missed when I was in such a hurry to reach the end the first time.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This game has taken over as my go-to time killer game. If you plan it right, it is easy to take over players much higher in rank than you. It is possible to play the game without spending real money. A big bonus with today's games.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book was informational and entertaining! It provides a historical and political perspective by someone who was really there. This book provided insight to the sacrifice america's fighting forces deal with daily.
1476733953|5.0|I purchased this E-Book ONLY because it showed up on a 'amazon best sellers' list and had such a high rating and so MANY reviews (thousands!).<br /><br />Here I am ~24 hours later and I've finished this book (~530 pages).  This is a fun, interesting, engaging book about a post apocolyptic world.  I absolutely loved it.<br /><br />Well done Hugh!  Now, as I peaked at your website, it seems that there may be volumes out beyond volume 5....I'm off to find them now!
B000QCQ9O8|5.0|In brief atonement is one of and perhaps the most compelling book I have read in some years. I can't recommend it more.
1451648537|5.0|The author spent a lot of time with Steve Jobs and has written a wonderful book. It's obvious that Isaacson really admired Jobs and tried to write a balanced story of his life. Because Jobs lived during our own lives, we all know who he was, or we thought we knew who he was. In fact, he was a genius but a difficult person sometimes, as is often pointed out by the author. Steve's adopted parents were wonderful and went to great lengths to bring him up with lots of love and values. When he was in the fifth grade, his school suggested that he skip two grades as he was so bored. He actually skipped only one grade, but when his parents found out that he wasn't happy in his new school, they asked him what would make him happy. He chose the school he wanted to attend, and they sold their house and bought one in the school district of his choice! At the time, he was only about 10 years old, but it was obvious to everyone that he was smarter than his parents and almost everyone else! He did well at his new school (the best in Silicon Valley) and met many people he would continue to have as friends and colleagues throughout his life! His adoptive father was an excellent example for Steve and Steve learned the value of doing your absolute best in everything. This continued throughout his life and from the time Steve met the other Steve (Wozniak), he knew he would excel in everything. They created the Apple computer, the first personal computer, and went on to more wonderful things; however, Woz didn't want to be rich and famous so he took a back seat to Jobs. We all know that Jobs wasn't an engineer but rather a visionary. What a rich story and one we all know is true. This is a must read for anyone who wants to raise children who excel and also for anyone who admires purity and excellence! I'm just sad that Steve died so young!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I was excited to play this Sim type game, however i waited and waited for the game to load and finally gave up, uninstalled the app, and never played this game.
B009ZW9DU2|5.0|The first time to read James Bowen and I found the story interesting, it made for light reading and if you are a lover of cats you will really enjoy it.!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|It is easier, sometimes, to witness history via a movie than a book.  However, one does have to bear in mind the use of artistic license
B0063GORYU|5.0|I chose this rating because every time I turn on my Kindle Fire, I play this game before I do anything else! If you are good at Solitaire, you will love this game as you actually have to play six games of Solitaire to win. Enjoy!
B000ID37RM|5.0|I was reading the book and i just had to see the movie... good quality and audio :-) :-) :-)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down. I found that it wasn't overly technical, a refreshing change from most sci-fi. The reader is able to visualize the action, the setting, and the characters throughout the entire story which will probably help this book remain accessible to a wide audience, not just sci-fi lovers. There is some very imaginative storytelling going on here, mixed with plenty of page-turning thrills.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Interesting look at the scouting background in baseball.  Clint Eastwood plays a believable character and interest doesn't wane during the movie
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Sky has simply endured every relationship she has had up to the point. She hides within herself during all romantic encounters. Holder will not tolerate Sky’s numbness when she is with him. Having never felt an emotional attachment to any of her other boyfriends, Sky fears the feelings she has with/for Holder. What Sky doesn’t realize is that her inexplicable deep feelings for Dean are easily explainable, she just doesn’t remember why.<br /><br />Dean does everything in his power to avoid having to shatter Sky’s world. However, neither of them knew of the other demon lurking in the shadows and how many people it would touch before the damage was done. Once all is revealed Dean and Sky will have to figure out how and if they can move forward with a future together.<br /><br />The pain that each of the main characters endures is very hard to read but the story is incredibly captivating. You can’t help but want to finish the book to see what happens and how it ends. Colleen Hoover has created characters that possess great strength and endurance. While the book doesn’t end with a happily ever after, it does end with the impression that each of the characters are stronger than they were at the beginning and that they will find happiness.<br /><br />Note: This book could emotionally overwhelm some readers. Having read it, I now fully understand that while the story may be about two young adults, some may not be able to handle the content.
B0063M22QO|5.0|It is my relaxing time on the train ride home. I look forward to the end of the day. Could the tiles be a bit larger?
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|This movie had a lot more substance to it than I thought it would. It was longer than I thought it would be, too. I really liked it.
B007Q0OUKS|4.0|Son-in-law is an avid Lego fan.  He has many kits and this one was on his wish list of kits
B000SVZIDA|5.0|Loved the sets, the story and of course the music. The characters were drawn very well and the story moved along at just the right pace.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This is by far the best game of its kind I have purchased yet. Well worth $2.99, I would definitely recommend this game. The story wasn't boring at all, graphics are great, I was amazed at how many of the actual &quot;hidden object&quot; scenes there are! It's not too hard to play but not too easy either, I played on expert mode, which I liked the fact I could choose to do so. The way the map is set up makes it easy to follow what you need to do, it was very helpful. All in all this game is EXCELLENT, five stars!! When you play a game you like you don't want it to end so The bonus chapter (scene) at the end was a great addition. (kindle fire HD)
B0027Z5DM6|5.0|Like many movie watchers, I have mixed feelings with Adam Sandler as an actor.  Sometimes he's funny, other times he comes across rather obnoxious and annoying.  However for Click he clicks (hehe).  I'm surprised how the pacing of this movie gradually shifts from several over the top comedy segments into a more emotionally devastating sad tone by the conclusion.  The transition is actually amazingly well-executed<br /><br />So, what's the storyline about?  When Adam Sandler accidentally stumbles upon a mysterious angel of death (Christopher Walken's character) Adam is given a remote device that can alter time in several different ways.  For the most part Adam uses the remote to go into the future and skip over all the family-related annoying aspects of his life that gives him the biggest annoyances (such as his EXTREMELY HOT WIFE (played by Kim Beckinsale) nagging at him to do his chores to name one example).  There's quite a bit of depth to Adam's family which is respectable.  It proves a fair amount of time was devoted to this movie.  I do recall a certain period in 2006 when the hype for Click was pretty high.<br /><br />Later on Adam realizes he can use the remote device to not only skip past the events he doesn't care for but also freeze time, eavesdrop into other peoples conversations and alter the size and shape of his face as well as his boss's body size (played by David Hasselhoff).  Admittedly it gets a bit silly by this point but please, keep watching!!  By the way it's somewhat funny seeing David Hasselhoff play a serious character after a certain hamburger incident he went through a while back.  I haven't seen him play such a role since Knight Rider!<br /><br />Anyway, you're probably wondering how it's possible that with all this skipping into the future chaos and Adam's often overbearing obsession fiddling with his time-travelling remote, how the storyline can possibly become emotional?  It's when Adam realizes that he's skipping ahead TOO much and missing key elements of his family's life.  He realizes he's spending too much time with his work and not enough time with his family.  This is when the storyline changes dramatically.  Like I said above though, it's a natural transition from comedy into seriousness, and trust me, Adam actually comes across convincingly in a serious role.  I know, usually he fails in that regard.<br /><br />By the way there's a Michael Jackson joke that's sort of eerie given the circumstances of his death a few years after this movies release.  Also, the dog humping segments were overkill and unnecessary.  Basically it's a time travelling movie, and one that succeeds in my book.  I know it's really easy to dismiss Adam Sandler as an overrated goofball, but in this one, his performance is actually pretty good so it's highly recommended that you watch it.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is from the same bunch that puts out &quot;Bridges&quot; - also very enjoyable and quite addictive.  Also good brain training in spatial relationships.
B004I2K4DY|4.0|I liked the first one better but this was very enjoyable. Excellent orchestration and loved all the different actors returning.
6302373921|4.0|I loved the songs they showed. However It would've been nicer if they included all the songs they played at the Rose bowl.
1449410243|5.0|Both my friends found the book very enjoyable and a great birthday present.  VERY FUNNY - web site also interesting.
B001DJLCPE|5.0|I THINK &#34;THE WAVE&#34; HAS GOT SOMETHING SIMILAR TO &#34;STRANGELOVE&#34;, WHICH IS ALSO SHOWING INNOCENT OR MANKIND WHO FIRSTLY WAS UNABLE TO DECIDE HOW THE STORY GOES, FINALLY TURNED EVERYTHING WORSE. THE ROOT IS THAT, WHEN EVERYONE HAS GOT PROBLEMS(NO MATTER WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE), ONCE THEY'RE IN CHARGE, THEY'RE ON THE COUNT AND READY TO EXPLODE. POWERFUL FILM UNDER THE WISDOM OF KUBRICK, IN AN OH-MY-GOD TRANSFER.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|I would have preferred a broader brush of Fantines character as in the play. She cared about her daughter so very much as well as the father that left them high and dry. It went too fast and it did not show that Jean Valjean took care of her in his own home before she died. The real caring seemed to be glossed over. Still loved it but a bit disappointing. I thought everyone played their parts superbly and the singing was incredible, including Russel Crowe.
B000002LGW|5.0|If you went to this concert, it brings back good memories. The sound is great and it makes you feel like you are enjoing the concert all over again.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|I enjoy the show. much better without commericials.<br /><br />every so often one will get hung up on getting in my Kindle, but usually goes well.
B0000TAZYW|5.0|THE WHOLE ALBUM WAS ARRANGED IN AN UNEXPECTED  AND BREATHTAKING MOOD THAT YOU CAN'T EVEN TRY TO GET YOU MIND OUT OF EVEN JUST FOR A WHILE. IT PROVED DIANA AS ONE OF THE GREATEST DIVAS IN THE DAWN OF THE NEW CENTURY. THE DVD-AUDIO PRODUCATION MASTERING WAS EXCELLENT, AND IT PRESENTS A DIFFERENT DEPTH AND SENSE THE ORIGINAL CD EDITION DIDN'T MANAGE TO TRANSFER.
B007QDNKQA|5.0|A good action movie that keeps you interested from very beginning to the very end. Mark Wahlberg at his best.
B0049SIE70|5.0|It's 2 Bad There's Only 5 Parts to This Series, In A Perfect World This Show Would Be On Everyday Like Your Moms General Hospital Ya Know. But Still The Walking Dead on AMC is Goin' Strong. There Needs To Be More Zombie Horror on TV and In The Movies 'Cause I Can't Get Enough.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This movie is great for those with a nice large HD TV. Beautiful images and a gripping story. Thoroughly enjoyable a movie that is a great way to pass an evening.
B001HPP2XW|5.0|IN MY MIND, IT'S AN ACADEMY -AWARD AFFIRMATED CLASSIC. HOWEVER, WITHOUT CAPOTE'S FANTASTIC STORY AND AUDREY'S SHINY PERFORMANCE, IT'S ALMOST NOTHING. HALF A CENTURY WOULD DO NOTHING TO A FILM THAT HAS SOLID SYNOPSIS AND EMOTIONS INSIDE. AND TO ME, EVEN DVD EDITION IS ENOUGH, FORMAT AIN'T EVERYTHING.

0061777250|5.0|Based on Anne Rice's review of this book, I finally got it and am reading. I did not want to wait until I'd finished to make my own recommendation: this is an excellent, sophisticated, elegantly written and well-documented book. Anyone interested in the science of the mind is highly advised to read this book. Van Lommel has put together a very compelling case that any simple explanations of NDEs and death itself are unfounded and frankly wrong. As they say, to disprove the notion that all crows are black, one only has to find one white crow. This book has a flock of them. :-)<br /><br />And one other reason to read: we will all get to experience death (100% of us, 100% guaranteed!) and some will experience a near-death phenomena. So why not find out what it is about and be prepared? Seems wise to read up on a place before you make a journey to it, so why not treat the inevitable with the same care and planning?
B00BRR66SA|5.0|JT did what more pop artists should do:<br />1. take time off,<br />2. develop a vision,<br />3. execute it<br />3.5 perfectly<br /><br />echoing the spirit of Frank Ocean's lyric &#34;the best song wasn't the single&#34;,<br />the 20/20 Experience takes you through a vivid aural landscape, rather than a sequence of tracks<br />the songs often top 7 minutes and Timbaland's expansive production is smooth and danceable (think candlelight vs strobe light),<br />while JT's swooning is confident and charming, delivered in a falsetto that other artists still chase with out-dated auto-tune.<br /><br />experience it yourself.
B00C32REYI|5.0|after listening to this album using high-end headphones and iPod with portable DAC/Amp I find it amazing how James Blake &#34;layers&#34; his music, creating incredible depth. I think James Blake is and amazing artist with a great sense of perfection.<br /><br />definitely recommend this album for any James Blake fan or anybody interested in electronica music.<br /><br />so far the Amazon MP3 quality has been pretty good as well.<br /><br />enjoy!!
B0009UC7QQ|5.0|This movie is amazing.  Great story, very paranoid and with an amazing ending.  Jim Carey is the best and there's so much going on here that it's worth multiple viewings.
B004V5A7K8|4.0|The musical chime at the end of each level is great. It caught my wife off guard. She looked around, asking &#34;What was that? I like that!&#34; I thought I was in the movie version of Popeye for a second.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I loved it. I watched it once and now will play all 4 disc's in row. I like hobbits.<br /><br />Pat
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting!!!! Hours of fun. Awesome game! I love it! What more can write for this review!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|It's a good fun matching game with a twist. It's not really complicated so don't expect super complex puzzles but if you need to waste some time this is a great way to do it.
B009JNXK88|4.0|Controls aren't the best use of touch screen, a game pad almost seems necessary for this type of game. Everything else is pretty sharp though.
0345803485|1.0|I never write reviews but this series is really awful.  Although I only got through about 1/2 the first book before realizing it's not going to get better, I read a review on the trilogy and determined I just can't waste precious time reading something that is so demeaning to women.  Sex scenes are one thing but abuse (mentally and physically) is not something I want to willingly read about... unless it's how to break the cycle.  I'm so glad I borrowed the books and didn't buy them.  What a waste of money!
B004EWFUQY|5.0|This diet really works.  I've lost 20 lbs since purchasing and following the instructions in this book.  I am trying to lose more.  Will have to write an addendum if I succeed.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This was a perfect follow up book! I cannot wait to read the third book. I definitely hooked to this series.
B008L1DNGI|4.0|The game is pretty kooky. It runs good too on my old MyTouch 4g. No complaints here! Love some old Sega games on the cheap.
B003TH6P9Q|5.0|I am still new to the show. However, this show must not do what &#34;Bones&#34; did and wait to long to get the two stars together. They almost lost Bones for good.  I understand you let the chemistry build. But then it can be a bit silly. They need to move it a long a bit faster for my taste anyway.  It is a first rate cast, the writing Is great but needs a few changes. But I do love the show and I really love that woman!!!!  lol  I have moved from the mentalist which I was not a fan of but learned to like it enough to watch, then i have moved to Castle. I am now caught up. Please Read the Review of &#34;JB&#34;. This person did a review that felt like he or she read my mind. And JB wrote it better than I will. Castle is funny, a kid at heart, and Beckett is a strong woman, and both have now been throw in a position to go one way or another. In the show Bones, in the forums, and ratings, it showed they had to put bones and booth together or lose the show. It was very simple. The writers lost that battle to screw with us. And House, they gave him and Cuddy four episodes before they destroyed their relationship and the show for good. And that show could have gone on for at least ten to 15 years depending on what they wanted to do. In Castle, they turned him dark, not as funny, they made it all about Beckett and all her whining.<br /><br />She is suppose to be the best Detective, hard and strong. But yet, all she does is whine. And the writers are doing all they can to make us feel like they love each other but they always have something, and it has become usually something so silly that precludes them from having one talk that would clear things up. Then when Beckett gets shot, Castle finally says &#34;I love you, I love you&#34;. Beckett has on so many occasions made remarks about how Castle has not said anything about how he felt about her. So finally in a really tough moment, he realizes He needs to say it to her finally. So he says it, then she passes out and ends up in surgery. This is how predictable this series is. When he said it, &#34;I love you, I love you&#34;. I knew she would say, &#34;i don't remember anything&#34;. And i also knew she would be lying when she said it. Then not long after, she is in therapy which is where we do actually hear her admit that she remembered everything. So again we are ending season 5, going into season 6 and they are not together. I should warn everyone now. The writers think they are clever.  So clever, they are not going to be on the air much longer unless they get these two together. So brace yourself. The things we loved about the show early on, have been gone for a while. It almost seems like they are writing the series and just finding ways to keep them apart. It's not as  fun anymore for me. Not the way it use to be. If they are not careful, they will not be on past season 6 and that is not even for certain. They need to lighten up the show, with the serious themes when they need it, and they need to get them together. Even kids and children have more sense then these adults. These types of shows are so predictable its the reason that most of the time people don't watch them and they are canceled. How about do something different. Put them together and have it work out? They did it on Bones and they are doing well. They ruined House.  The show will do better and the fans will be happy. Don't believe me? Read the forums. Look at the ratings from early on to now. I like this show and i hope they correct it so that it stays on the air. i use to really enjoy it. I am loyal and will watch, and hope they get together and really make the fans happy and extend the years of the show.  Such a great cast!!!s up in surgery. This is how predictable this series is.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have not watched TV of any kind in the past 5 years for a variety of reasons but decided to watch this and think it is very interesting, very clever, and beautifully done even if it is just a high brow night time soap opera.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|this is one of the best games and I am not a game person. I am staying up too late.
B004HO6I2E|5.0|MY BROTHER GOT MOVIE AND HE SAW THE MOVIE AND CALL ME TO TELL ME ABOUT THE MOVIE..SO I HAD TO GET IT...
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Amazing movie. It keeps you interested every minute. Wow.. i am still blown away! I will watch this again soon.
B005K2YTG4|2.0|The product headline and description state it is sized for the Kindle paperwhite; however, it is over an inch longer than it needs to be even allowing for the fact it is an envelope sleeve. It is large enough that I can add my iphone in its otterbox and small wallet as well. I was looking for something sized more appropriately and would fit the kindle securely, but there is a lot of movement on the inside. I will consider using it as a back up for my kindle fire, which it fits more appropriately, but I definitely don't recommend it for the paperwhite.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome the second I started playing I was addicted to it I have it on my ipod and kindle now but if the makers of the game read this please lower the prices of the charicters they are too expensive in game

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|SAw this at the movies and with the DVD found things I had missed the first time round. Loved  the dwarfs and especially Richard Armitage as Thorin. Kept me glued to the sroey and a film I can watch over and over again.
B003XQPYR2|5.0|It 'fiddles' with history a little, but give plausible resons for some other things.  Well thought out, well acted and really protrays king John for the slimeball he was.  It has some intrigue, plenty of action and give the reasons (treatment of his subjects/Northern Barons, etc) leading up to the signing of the important Magna Carta.
B003ZSISGM|3.0|I find with this book, especially book one, has great parts but also has so many slow parts that its a difficult book to continue reading. During the really slow parts, I find myself having to always re-read sentences because my brain doesn't absorb the boring parts and the first time unread them. The only reason I'm still reading them is because I always have to finish series I've started lol.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Couldn't wait to see what happened next, Watney was one tough sob , he never gave up.  I was happy he made it off of Mars.

B00007KWHN|5.0|I had this CD in a bunch I thought I might get rid of, I looked through them, pulled \\"Yes\\" out, slapped it in the player, put on the headset, I got blown away!, how in the world could I ever think about parting with this absolute gem?, I'm still kicking my arse, it is the best album Yes ever put out by far, \\"Starship Trooper\\" still wipes me out!, sorry I never got to see them live, please buy and KEEP this disc!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I thought this movie was awesome. It is the best movie i have seen in a very long. Dont listen to all the negative reviews. Peter Jackson and everyone involved did a amazing job taking  a great book and turning it into an amazing film. The images of New Zealand are beautiful.  I cant wait till the next one.

1476733953|4.0|I really don't even know if Wool fits into the post apocalyptic genre.  A different concept of surviving and the will to survive in a hostile environment.<br /><br />I really like this book but, it did drag on in the beginning and then it picked up speed all the way to the end.  There are a couple of concepts in this book that just was a bit hard to swallow for me and hence the 4 stars.  Wool would make an excellent movie if only the producer and director would follow the book.  One thing I can say about this book, it really makes you think of the people in the silo and what you would do in a situation like that.  Are we so inclined to accept the way things are and what is handed to us?  Is it much different from what it is like here in the present?  Kinda makes you wonder . . . . . .
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Wonderful book from beginning to end.  Once I started, I couldn't put it down!  What an amazing woman!  Great read!
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Went in thinking this was gonna be one of those really funny movies, such as 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, or Forgetting Sarah Marshal, like it was advertised as.  BUT NO! It had a couple of funny moments, mixed with very sad and serious life issues. A copious amount of fighting, marital issues, family issues, and general mopiness and life sadness goes on in this movie. Wish I could take back watching this movies. SEVERE LET DOWN!
0743289684|2.0|Unfortunately I made the mistake of listening to a TV personality who raved about the book.  Don't waist you money.
0307719774|5.0|I have been looking for a Diary type Jourmal.  This is perfect!  Take a peek inside the Book ... I am sure you'll agree.  The book is well made and not cheap.
B00785P2QC|4.0|it is a good game. I agree with that, but you have to pay for investment points and they are really expensive.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|it is a good game it has a bunch of different levels and people don't forget the carsall in all its good
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|I wanted to love this book but did not. Could not get past the 16 and 17 year old characters talking and acting like they were 30.
B005LAIH54|4.0|Ungrateful as ever, Perseus (a grim Sam Worthington) fishes while the number of gods dwindles to a mere handful of holdouts.  To stay alive, the gods require worship/belief in them; otherwise they snuff out like candles.  Isn't that a little like clapping your hands if you believe in fairies to save Tinkerbell's life?  Makes one wonder just how much power they wield if ignoring them ends their existence.<br />Be that as it may, not being a history buff or an expert on mythology, I had to view this solely as an adventure flick.  As with the first film, a quest is involved along with a stringent deadline.  It's brother against brother and while I do appreciate a good family melodrama, this isn't it.  There's redemption and death galore.  The CGI is front and center and holds sovereignty over everything.  Lots of action for the sake of action (not necessarily a bad thing).  Kronos does not make for a particularly scary monster so it's fortunate they have others to contend with as well.  Bill Nighy is great as the befuddled Hephaestus (his nemesis is small, gold, and fowl).  Ralph Fiennes, the villain from the first installment, is now reduced to serving as the petulant sidekick of the EVIL Ares (Edgar Ramiez).  (Ares is the most confusing casting choice of the lot, being Venezuelan, with a heavy accent that doesn't really coincide with Greek gods.  Did Zeus send him away to a South American college while he doted from afar on his son Perseus?)<br />This is a dopey but fun/exciting film that I can easily watch numerous times.  As long as I stop thinking about all those pesky details that make no sense.  From accents to why Andromeda went from a brunet to a blonde........<br /><br />Supposedly, there's a third installment in the works: Revenge of the Titans.  Considering the number of gods left, who's going to take up the vendetta?
B0083Z614S|5.0|LOVE IT ALL TIME FAVORITE.<br />ALL TIME CLASSIC ALL SHOULD READ IT...  THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY TO YOU NOW.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love Downton Abbey and can't wait for the next season to start.  I ordered this one episode because I missed it.
B0058U08Y0|3.0|I have always loved this band, one of my all time favorites.  This album definetly has it's moments.  Great musicianship all around.  Good lyrics, or should I say, good story's, awesome guitar work......well done.  So why only 3 stars?  I have 2 problems with this. 1) I really don't care for the long spacey intro on the first track, or some of the other spacey stuff on the rest of the album.  It's cool if they want to experiment, but at times I forgot I was listening to Maiden. And 2) I don't understand why the first Grammy the band ever received was for El Dorado.  I mean, it's not a bad song or anything, but if this song get's an award, there should be MANY others before it that got an award too.  It's almost as if the Grammy commitee decided that Maiden deserved an award for what they have accomplished overall, and they would've got the award regardless of what single was on the album.  If it was say....Run to the Hills, or Aces High, or the Wicker Man on this album instead of el dorado, then those songs would've recieved the award instead.  It's all timing, and I don't agree with it.  But regardless, all Dickenson Maiden is AWESOME!!!

B001GH3KLW|4.0|There are some good jams here, downloaded this mostly for the unreleased material. And my personal favorite Grateful Dead album cover.
B001TH15UM|5.0|Excellent playing by all, and fantastic production values. Steve Howe is on top of his game. The Tokyo audience is the standard, non-punk, quietly clapping iteration we have seen in so many videos.
B000ELJBAK|5.0|Gilmour's version of Floyd started here (literally, considering the instrumental &#34;Raise My Rent&#34; would form the basis for &#34;What Do You Want From Me&#34; on The Division Bell), but it still has a sound fitting that period of Floyd (Animals, Wish You Were Here), and another song or two were heavily altered or borrowed from for guitar parts on The Wall.  Long story short, if you're a hardcore Floyd fan, you've already got this.  If you're a casual/starting Floyd fan - don't hesitate to pick this up just because it's a solo album, especially if you enjoy post-Waters Floyd or Gilmour's playing and voice in general.  This is definitely his strongest solo album overall; not a disappointing track on here.  About Face has, IMO, his best solo moments though, while having a couple mediocre moments.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Wonderful story. I have read many books, but this book held me in ways I haven't felt in a long while. The way the main character develops through the story is a great story telling master piece.
B0018AM1YY|5.0|Has all the great hits!, brings back so many memories from my youth! it a Great buy! I highly recomended
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I want expecting much and not really a fan of farm games but I love Jurassic park. Win in my book.

B004GYY714|4.0|Works well the vast majority of the time. Tons of stations to choose from. Great for special occasions like Christmas and st Patricks Day.
B000FA675C|3.0|The idea is an interesting one, but the author's execution just isn't for me. The writing, especially at the beginning, seemed rather clunky and plain. Throughout the book Brown has a habit of going into deep description of things that have nothing to do with the plot whatsoever. It's ok, but I definitely won't be reading another Dan Brown.

030758836X|2.0|This book is a best seller and a hot title on many \\"to read\\" lists, getting buzz all around. That's how I learned of it and I was psyched to dig in, hoping for more than I got. I'm not sure quite how to review this book because while I think the premise is smart, in the end it was an unsatisfying and inconclusive read for me...from the beginning actually. It's not often that I just give up on a book but I was almost there on this one at 100 pages in. A good friend encouraged me to stay with it until Part II. I didn't know that Part II was half way through the book, so at that point, I just decided to go with it although the opening event(s) of Part II were not a surprise to me, as I'd hoped it would be.<br /><br />Getting back to smart, the format of the book told by different narrators is a bit different and takes a little getting used to, but if you've read \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" and can follow that, this is a breeze. It's billed as a \\"Psychological thriller\\" and I guess I could agree, but if you figure out the pattern, the thrill doesn't last long. I couldn't help but think of the main characters in the same vein as the main players in \\"Seinfeld\\", except they weren't funny. Clearly the protagonists are smart and ingenious, but they're also shallow, selfish, unscrupulous, vacuous and I couldn't find a redeeming quality among them. The police were played for fools and their behaviors made the plot quite unbelievable at some points. In fact, there were lots of holes in the actions that woulda, coulda, shoula been discovered by the police authorities or plugged by the author prior to publication. I think it would've made for a stronger plot. Some of the background players that had limited page time were far more interesting characters that might have had a better story to integrate into this one.<br /><br />The ending was a let down for me with no real conclusion. I don't want to say more and give away plot lines, except to say that there's plenty of \\"evil-doing\\"to go around with a few twists that unfortunately aren't entirely unexpected. If you are looking for an easy, throw away beach read and you get this book cheap, go ahead and read it; you'll get a cheap thrill. However, I can't recommend paying full price for this as I found it unsatisfying and felt as if it was incomplete in the end. This isn't a thriller that will stand the test of time.

B003H6Z194|4.0|I am super thrilled lately at the opportunity to review some great Christian Family DVD's and the latest from Word Films, the makers of inspirational films like Faith Like Potatoes and Journey To Grace, has launched it's newest one, Break Away. Break Away is the inspiring story based on actual events chronicling the story of a hard working husband that loses his job and is forced to use what he has and let God multiply it. It takes place in South Africa and accounts Francois' challenge of providing for his family after losing his job. He is forced to use what he has, including an old bicycle. With the help of his \\"black sheep\\" brother, a bicycle shop owner and pro-cyclist, Francois makes some life-changing discoveries about his life, career, and faith in God.<br /><br />This is a powerful look at what so many are experiencing all over the world in these economic hard times. What would you do, if no matter where you looked for a job, they all seemed to come up empty handed. Not only that by the collection calls continue for your credit cards and mortgage, but with no money in sight, you have to make the best of what you have. I think what really touches the heart of the viewer the most, is that this isn't a quick fix, and that Francois and his family really struggle with the same issues we all do. How can we have faith in God when it seems like our prayers are going unanswered at times. How as the man, the main financial provider, in his family, he feels like this is a personal burden and ultimately his responsibility to provide for them. The solution isn't an easy one and you find yourself rooting for Francois the entire time. His ability to create something from nothing is mind-blowing and really pushes us to think outside the box in answers to our own problems.<br /><br />I received Break Away from Word Films compliments of Blogger Gateway for my honest review and received no monetary compensation for a favorable one. Because this movie was filmed in South Africa, at times, the accents can be a bit difficult to understand. However, that does not take away from the impact of the story. This DVD runs 113 minutes and really encourages us to have faith when it seems like the odds are truly against us. I personally rate this one a 4 out of 5 stars.at times, the accents can be a bit difficult to understand. However, that does not take away from the impact of the story.

B003TJR2HS|5.0|This adapter finally allowed my 3rd generation iPod integration in my car (&#34;Dension ice link&#34;), to charge my iPhone 4S.  No more &#34;charging not supported&#34; message on my iPhone!  It did not affect my ability to use my steering wheel controls to change songs on my iPhone either.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|At first I was all, &#34;Oh, joy, another sappy love-story&#34;, that my MOM insisted I start reading. I finally succumbed to buying this book and reading it. Once the more riscae parts came, I just thought to myself, &#34;WTF am I reading??! And why can I NOT put this thing down?!?!!&#34; Needless to say, I was hooked and read all three books on my deployment. Don't read it! It's like literary crack: You get suckered into it, then the next thing you know, you have ot have more. Fight the urge! ;)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very addicting game!  My kids often want to grab my kindle and play it too!!  I also have a hard time putting it down.

B003H9M1Q2|5.0|We bought this because our grandson loves trains and animals.  This is the perfect combination of gorgeous color and a fun story.  And Casey Jones and Dumbo are the icing on the cake.  Our grandkids watch it every time they come to visit-which is at least once a week!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This is an awesome fps fun campaign great multiplayer awesome graphics and sound the controls are a little hard to get used to but overall one of my favorite games

B001EBV0OY|5.0|One of the best movies of all time.  It can be a tiny bit uncomfortable to watch at times (not a kids movie) but its very entertaining and never boring.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I couldn't put the book down.  Fascinating while at the same time a bit unnerving.  Strayed doesn't hold back and it's a wonder she made it with all her &#34;issues&#34; in her life.  But, a real insight into someone pressing forward even with all the demons they have experienced in their life.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Game is fun works well for the money lol easy to learn and control would recommend it to a friend of mine who like. this type of game
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Written from the witty point of view of a 16-year old girl, I couldn't enjoy this book more; I did suffer quite a bit more.<br />I praise John Green for his writing, and this book opened up my eyes to the world of those who live with death like a chip on their shoulder. I love it.
B000FA675C|5.0|Like Stewie Griffin... I. LOVED. THIS. BOOK.<br /><br />I read the whole thing over two days and found the whole experience very enjoyable.  What a great gem.  But stay away from the movie.
B0017HEX76|5.0|I watched this movie as a child and now I can watch it with our grandchildren.  The music is what draws you in plus the animation is simply spectacular.  I don't think our grandkids realized that this is music (and movie making) for the ages!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game. It so fun I play it every time go subway surfer! Go subway surfers! This game rocks a lot!
B00BJS7104|1.0|Django Unchained is an utterly despicable film made by a talentless hack who excels at simultaneously mimicking and mocking true artists. It instills anti-white hatred and encourages horrific violence based on a made up history.<br /><br />You have to be one sick and twisted individual to enjoy this 'film'.
B005K2YTG4|5.0|Lightweight, sturdy, and a cheery color scheme I never tire of looking at.  Protects the Kindle anywhere I go.  Five stars!

B003U53GK8|4.0|The acting is terrific and so is the suspense, but I dare  you to figure out what's happening. I get the sense that the writers had a field day exercising their imaginations. There's no end to the permutations and combinations of plot lines and time travel. If there's a rational plan or explanation for the unfolding of the series, it escapes me.
B000FA675C|5.0|Yes it's not the best mystery story ever.  Yes he's not the best writer ever.  But if you like an interesting read with some historical facts and etymology thrown in, give it a read.
0670024813|5.0|My son is an Anthropologist and has directed me (as a novice) to read certain text.  This was one of them.  I enjoy Diamond's style and his ability to relate history, psychology, anthropology, science and literature into one cohesive story.

B003WUYP56|4.0|Smolin is is a theoretical physicist (at least part-time) so were he to use the actual language his profession uses I could not have gotten past the introduction. Instead he uses lots of normal people language, making his telling of the physics/math histories -- even some of their politics -- very readable. It's cool to think of these scientists as human. Smolin does a good job expressing the emotional side of his work, the ups and the downs. In terms of the &#34;problem&#34; he discusses, I leave his story wondering if our brains won't understand the next stage in understanding reality until or unless some kind brain evolution occurs.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Made me laugh.  Catchy tunes.  Good quality.  Ended up buying the movie after I kept wanting to re-rent it.  Definitely a good easy laugh movie.

B009FZHYKU|4.0|A turning point in the plot line of Walking Dead in season 3, the 303 episode was full of new story and character introductions. Starting with the helicopter crash of the National Guardsmen, to the netherworld od Woodbury, the Andrea, Michonne, and yes, the demented Governor, depict the masked hope of a new civilization beyond Rick's prison safe haven. Of course, we know how bizarre this town haven can be. Especially when we see how the Governor spends his quiet time in his personal man cave in the last scene.

B00B2YH7D6|5.0|Dave Grohl and the production staff have put together an incredibly entertaining, historically important, rock and roll masterpiece.  I know some of the people that recorded at Sound City and their descriptions of the place, the feel, the sound, etc. of this venue matches up perfectly with the movie.  If you're into music, guitars, drums, recording, etc. you have to see this movie.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like how you can have a save me now and u can't die as much. Also that you can be in different city's
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I truly enjoy seeing the series as Batman was intended to build the character, his fears and flaws.  A little darker and less comedic.  The technology concepts are amazing.  A fun movie to have in the library
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I can see what they Judd was going for here, but the film doesn't pull it off.  Parenthood is a better film overall, and illustrates what I think Judd was aiming for.  Seriously - a guy asking his wife to look up is ass for hemorrhoids?  That's not 'real life' or funny - it's just stupid and disgusting.

B004LROUNG|4.0|Good plot and humorous too! The two older lawyers and the judge are are some characters! I like this kind of reading.
B00AZRBLHO|3.0|I concur with a lot of what Nonapeptide said. http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2MQ3AZEVSULT3/ref=cm_cr_rdp_pdp<br /><br />I work in IT, Sysadmin and occasionally DevOps. If I didn't have a lot of time on my hands at the moment due to an injury, I probably wouldn't have finished this book. Although the descriptions of all types of IT disaster were incredibly accurate, the storytelling was complacent and the characters extremely stereotypical. Everyone came to terms and learned the intended lessons far too easily.<br /><br />I might've appreciated the novel style of this book more if the methodologies mentioned were footnoted at the end of each chapter, or a study/reference list at the end of each chapter. That way I could glean the concepts from the fiction and have immediate access to the source materials to reinforce the concepts.<br /><br />Great effort, but the facile problem resolution at every turn left me feeling more than a bit 'meh.'
B008V8FVTI|5.0|a very accurate description of the era and its problems...<br />an it was a good story well told!<br />would defiantly recommend ..

B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I love this film. I was so excited to purchase this special edition DVD when it came out.<br /><br />I was blown away by the 2 HOURS of behind the scenes production diaries.<br /><br />I was, however, extraordinarily disappointed that this DVD did NOT include a director's commentary. I know I'm probably the only person who cares, and the only person who actually takes the time to watch a film with the director's commentary, but honestly that's one of my favorite things about DVDs. I love hearing directly from the people who create the film while I watch it. I'm just incredibly disappointed that Peter Jackson didn't do a director's commentary for this film. Sure, he comments a lot on things during the special features, but I miss that real-time commentary on the finished product.
B000FA675C|5.0|This book was great. It had mystery in every chapter and kept me wanting to read more. I love all of Dan Brown's books and I am a fan. I would recommend this book to others.

B0092MKTL2|4.0|I'm relatively new to the Imagine Dragons, but I have fallen in love. Their music will take you on a journey, through ups and downs. I love that they can have such a stylistic variety on this album, and yet it still feels like it's them. I have been recommending this album to everyone I know. Definitely worth it, especially how cheap it is here on Amazon.<br /><br />I'll just echo some other reviews when I say that the actual audio quality is a little subpar here. I think it's more a production decision than an amazon problem, but I wish the songs were more crystal clear instead of sounding so muddy.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Completely addictive.  Very cool &#34;tetris like&#34; game.  The kids like it too!  The levels get gradually harder without overwhelming the young ones.  Great for all ages.
0812982622|5.0|Adam Johnson is a remarkable author.  He gives us an amazing glimpse of life in North Korea through the use of his characters, their lives, loves and relationships.  His research of North Korea allows us to understand the fictional story on a different level.  We learn about orphanages, fishing boats, prisions, interrogators, torture, etc.  There were many times I didn't want to read what was going to happen next but I couldn't stop myself from continuing.  I needed to know what would come to the lives of my new friends, living such an unbelievably oppressive life.  The story is depressing, yet inspiring.  Humans can face almost anything and continue to feel and to love.  I learned much about North Korea while getting carried away in an intriguing story.
B00821OX98|5.0|This show does more than it has to. I would have watched for the premise alone, but it's smart, creative and packs something fresh into each episode.  Looking forward to season 2.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Sad, soulful, and gut wrenching. I'm not sure the happiness in the end makes up for the misery dealt to Mr. McCLoone. I hope that all those involved in so called \\"orphanages\\" get due justice from God.
B009G78EE2|4.0|Writing in this space as Amazon won't simply let me star rate an album. Seems a bit much if they want people to actually rate music.
B004AGI2L4|4.0|It was entertaining. A bit gory sometimes. If you're looking for an action movie set  in  some cool locations it's pretty good.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Just started playing but so far I like it!  Run out of energy quickly though and have to wait for more.
B007SNFWU0|4.0|a real page turner.  Well written and builds slowly. Keeps you wondering..what next?  I would recommend this to anyone liking intense thriller type stories.  I also liked the way the story flashed back and forth between the two timelines.  Well done!
0061537969|5.0|I'm only halfway through the book, but when I get to reading it, I really get into it! Gives you a whole new perspective of dogs, and animals in general. Heartwarming, tear-jerking, and humorous all make this book one I believe animal lovers need to read!

B009LMTDL0|5.0|As a woman in my 70's I find this book so important for all women to read. When I started my career in 1955 there was no thought of women doing jobs held by men. My generation made many mistakes and were called bitches, though we opened doors for other young women. If more women were in executive positions there would be greater productivity and high morale. Folks who worked for me were worried at the start then they found out that a woman will teach, coach,mentor and promote those who are willing to make an effort to succeed. I know more women would go high in their field if they would read this entertaining and educational book.
B000FA675C|5.0|it is very good, I think it is worth reading and I will suggest it to my friend. I will continue to pay attention to more books
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|this is a cool game it is really fun to play with all your face book friends and family u will enjoy it I am sure if not un install right
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Of course I had read the reviews, how popular this book was.  When I noted it was on sale I relented and thought I'd read it for mindless entertainment.  I couldn't get pass the introduction of the two main characters.  I was bored and I hadn't even gotten to any of the sex scenes I had heard so much about. Unrealistic superficiality is the best term for what little I could stomach.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Way better than the HBO series.  Cannot wait for the next book to be written so I can read that one too
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|Very creative and well done!!! Now they want me to write 14 more words to satisfy the minimum requirements. Done.

0670026603|5.0|Louisa Clark's life is a small one, in that she has never been farther afield than the castle in the tourist town where she lives.  But she is comfortable working in the local cafe and with her long-time boyfriend Patrick.  Her only problem with living at home with her parents is that she has to live in a \\"box room\\" so that her sister Katrina and her son can have the bigger bedroom.<br /><br />But then the cafe closes and Louisa is forced to find a new job.  At twenty-six, she has very few skills to recommend her.  Nevertheless, the option of a job as a caregiver for a quadriplegic man named Will Traynor does not seem very appealing.<br /><br />But she signs a six-month contract and manages to get through the first days and weeks with the acerbic, moody boss who doesn't seem at all amenable to her attempts to cheer him up.<br /><br />Then Louisa discovers something shocking.  Something that will change everything about the next six months.  And as she strives to make every day positive for Will, she also begins to find her own life and her own outlook changing, too.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0670026603 Me Before You: A Novel]] is one of those kinds of stories that grips the heart and plumbs the depths of one's soul.  I felt happy, sad, and inspired as I joined Louisa and Will on their explorations.  Told from Louisa's perspective, and then alternately joined by other narrators, like Mr. and Mrs. Traynor and Louisa's sister Katrina, I had the opportunity to see inside each of them as they struggled with Will's choices.<br /><br />A part of me kept hoping for some kind of miracle, but even as I realized that not everything would turn out the way I'd imagined, I was also pleasantly surprised by a nice mix of sadness with feel-good moments. A lovely, unforgettable love story full of inspiration. Five stars.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I love Mumford & Sons and this CD is fantastic! The quality was great and it came very quickly after I ordered it. You can't go wrong with Mumford & Sons so I highly recommend this CD.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|Has a decidedly philosophical bent without being in your face about it.<br /><br />Last episode very disjointed, but I suspect it was because the writers knew it was the last one.
B009K0OL06|4.0|My wife and I are huge fans of Revenge and, after viewing Season 1, had to buy Season 2. The show is so riveting and chock full of twists and turns that it leaves you yearning for the next episode. Of course we have a big screen HDTV so the HD version was a must.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sheryl Sandberg writes a strong advocation for awareness. This book is a call to both women and men to recognize that there still is a gender gap. And to top it off, she explains how it is women holding ourselves back! Her explanation of social expectations and stereotypes coupled with research to provide the facts helps us to understand what is happening and how it can change.

B00005KAQP|5.0|I saw this film when it was first released in theaters and immediatly fell in love with it. When it became available on home video(VHS) I bought it not only for myself but also for my brother and sister-in-law. I still have my vhs copy, but as Iv'e gotten older, I can noonger hear some of the dialogue without turning the volume up full blast. I love the fact that now with the dvd I can look at the subtitles, and not miss anything of this very funny movie!
B008602KQI|4.0|I enjoyed this movie; well done entertainment. I was a bit apprehensive but the action and story were pretty good.
B00190N4E4|5.0|The movie Gandhi follows the life story of one of the most influential non-violent leaders. The beginning shows his assignation, but then back tracks to earlier in his life. He moves from English where he is a respected lawyer to South Africa where he is treated as trash. He is astonished by such treatment that is received to men who are laborers to men who are educated and wealthy. He proposes changes. He wants equal treatment and rights. He doesn't not believe they should be required to carry passes that the white men are not required to have. Slowly, he gains supporters. These supporters are scared to stand up, but their bravery shows thru and they do. All of the ideas that Gandhi proposes are non violent. He explains that he will be struck, his bones may be broken, he may be killed, but they will never have his obedience or spirit. He is imprisoned after a non violent march, but that raises questions within the white Christians of the town. The government contends to his requests to remove the new legislative paper laws and releases all prisoners from the march. Gandhi's changes are not only for the government but for Hindu's aswell. He wishes to do away with the caste system. He even goes so far as to do the jobs of what is considered for the untouchables or the lowest caste. Shortly after, Gandhi returns to India. After the incident in South Africa, Gandhi begins to dress as a common Indian man as opposed to what his status would have been in that time. While he is in India he travels all over. He grew up in England so he did not understand the real conditions at which the people were living in. Traveling across India he does what he can to help his people. He is constantly arrested and down trotted by the English politicians. Gandhi always preaches non violence and his followers do the same. At a meeting where Indian men and women gather to speak of this non violence English soldiers unleash fire and killed over a thousand people who never fought back. Gandhiexplains that the English will walk out of India because they will realize thru non violent strikes they have no place. Some Indians still break out into riots and fight so Gandhi chooses to fast until there is no more violence. One of Gandhi's most memorable non violent marches is when he walks to the sea and makes salt. At the time, this was illegal since all the salt profits were owned by the British Empire. As Gandhi persist with his nonviolent speeches he and his wife and sent to prison again. While in prison his wife suffers from a heart attack and passes away. Shortly after, India gains its independence from the British Empire. After its independence India still had its own problems to work out. India was filled with Muslims and Hindus. Both of these two religions were scared to be ruled by the others. The solution, though Gandhi did not agree, was two independent nations: India for the Hindus and Pakistan for the Muslims. Many were forced to leave the homes they always knew to journey to their appropriate country. Violence broke out as many traveled hatred that was once directed towards the British was now directed towards each other. Gandhi fasts once more in hope that the violence will end once more. Finally, the Hindus and the Muslims alike lay down their arms and vow no violence against each other. In the end, surrounding by a sea of his admirers there is one man who comes and shoots him. Gandhi's body may not live on and but his teachings, that were recorded, will always live on and be remembered.

B0060CV6ZA|5.0|I loved this as a kid, thought it was an adventure of highest order. Watching it today, it is still a wonderful adventure that avoids all the trappings of modern films that try to present an origin story that makes the first 1/3 of any movie rather boring. (how many times must we see the hero be called to a rich benefactor and told of the dangerous mission that his team will embark on?) This movie dumps all of that and we are in for an old-school serial-adventure from the start. The effects many times work well, but sometimes belie their 1979 origins. The acting is suitably hammy, complete with mouthfuls of techno-babble thrown together to sound amazing. Some of the &#34;science&#34; in this sci-fi is dubious at best, including moments where you wonder how they thought this was believable. Some of it made me laugh when that was not their intent... but boy did I have fun.<br /><br />Don't take the above as a slam on the movie. I really enjoyed it, In all it is everything it should be for a &#34;Saturday matinee adventure.&#34; I just realize that nostalgia may be a large factor in my enjoyment. While that fact tempers my endorsement, I do have 3 younger kids that also enjoyed it greatly. Watching their faces and seeing the same reaction on them as what I remembered proved to me that the movie captures some element of adventure that everyone's inner 8-year-old longs for.<br /><br />Enjoy the movie for exactly what it is: a fantastical time of imagination and fun.
B003AKLFAG|5.0|loved the story line and the suspense..Like said in other review not the weak mind..Highly recommended for someone who wants to watch an interesting movie

034537410X|5.0|As far as the reader of this book whom I bought this book for is concern, he was very pleased. I bought this as a gift requested by a friend who was in serving in Afghanistan. He was very pleased.
B000FA675C|2.0|Not something I would read all the way through...Glad I did not waste my time and money on the movie... But, hey how would we know if we did not try to read it.....?
B004BSFC6Y|4.0|This was a gift for our niece.  She loved them, the only sad part was that they grow out of them so quickly.  They were exactly what we expected them to be...noisy play toys!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another great Grisham book-Can't get enough!!!  ....and it has a twist at the end, so enjoy the bumpy ride home.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|solid movie that is probably not best for young kids but does show an interesting reality.  great actors and good acting follow.
B000I8ES5C|2.0|I love this movie when it is dubbed. usually I will always go for English subtitles over English dubbing, but the actors who dubbed this film made it 100% better. I thought I was buying the English dubbed version since it did not specify which it was, but I was ultimately disappointed. This movie is boring in it's original language, and I would not buy it if you have the option to get it in English.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Like the many options for Bible version and for reading plans.  Also love the catch up feature for when I get behind (because life happens) or read ahead.  I recently discovered the search functionality - great for when I am looking for scriptures on a specific subject.
B000MZHW40|5.0|This, could be, the way some diamonds reach the world markets, I remember all the news of brutal human stories back in the 80's and 90's, more likely, way before that, in countries that mined diamonds...working under gun wielding thugs, for pennies a day, only to suffer from the harsh environment, living onsite in guarded camps,wanting to leave, they would not hesitate to shoot you where you stand innocent or guilty, this is a trip thru the in's and out's of the diamond business...gripping, heart pounding movie...

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really enjoy playing this fun game. The difference between this game and the first version is that this one has better graphics than the previous on. The controls are the same. Only one gorilla is chasing you instead of multiple gorillas. It's a game that I really recommend.
B000M341QE|5.0|Martin Scorsese (Goodfellas) who directed a cast of \\"well known actors\\" in this movie, Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen, Alex Baldwin and others....(and produce by Brad Pitt)...but  \\"Jack Nicholson\\" who was the mob boss was nothing but a \\"who did what\\" double cross, of crime and consequences of a con, and a gun...... entertaining, gripping, heart pounding, well directed movie....with surprise ending....it caught me off guard...a must see...
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Best money I think I've ever invested in entertainment! Searching for Sugarman Rocks! Deserves all the accolades it's recieved! Highly recomend it!
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The cast did a awesome job, the story line was intense!!!!!
B00AYQNOU8|1.0|Total waste of time and money... oh well... there are plenty of duds in video land and this one tops the list.
0792838068|5.0|In not giving away the storyline, this is about a down and out lost soul (Cage) who has nothing else to do except turn to alcohol to<br />wipe away his failure....until he meets a Vegas call girl, (Shue)....he has one goal, to drink himself into oblivion, and she see's something about him enough to help him cope with his serious depression, only to fall in love with him...
B004ZJZPZC|5.0|I used the digital download to put this movie on my iPad. I am enjoying the film and music in the car and at the gym. I love it.
B000JZ68GG|1.0|I remember when I saw this as a kid, it was like the poison fruit that all kids wanted to see.  Now, I see that it was just a really bad movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Wonderful graphics, love the variety in horses, and I have a lot of buying my horse new tack.<br />Would like for the prices on the horses to drop to a sensible price though.
B002IYEQR4|5.0|One of the greatest stories ever told! The book really spoke to me on multiple levels. So the ultimate cut blue ray is just a great effort by a film maker to be respectful of the source material. Really pulled it off!
B004UPALT6|5.0|I love this since the 80's,  avid Bruce Campbell fan and the series is awesome. Evil Dead 2 rocks above all.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Long but worthy!! I love this movie, and the fact that it's a true story makes you love it even more.
B00992CF6W|3.0|it's good but if it had a lite I would be happy!!!!!and if it  had monsters In all modes that
0486295559|2.0|The Good: I was interested enough in the plot to want to finish the book and understand what happened.<br /><br />The Bad: Persuasion kept putting me to sleep. So, after weeks of fighting it, I made it the book I would read before bed. Two pages and I was out like a light. Of course, that made progress basically non-existent and it was virtually impossible to keep the characters distinguished from one another. About a little less than three-quarters of the way through, I gave up. Put the book down. Googled the cliff's notes. Got the general gist of what was going on that I, for the life of me, could not grasp. And thanked heaven above that I had to read Emma in high school and not Persuasion.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|i liked this because as a retired person these peole were believable and most interesting.  It is amazing how they could adjust to such a different world at their advanced age.  The older you are the harder it is to adjust to change.  Maybe that is why this is such fun to watch.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The back story was a bit ... well ... stupid and the acting suggested the actors knew it.  Still, the cast and director somehow pulled it off and the movie was very enjoyable once I got past my initial disappointment with the back story.
0439023521|5.0|A great read.  A book that has it all.  Suspense and romance.  A book for teenagers and adults.  Love it!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book all the way to the end. I was smart and compelling. One of the better books I've read in a while.

B00932A3SK|5.0|first it's northEurope film ,not high product or fast food style movie of hollywood.<br />secend  this film is good plot ,great making , good actors ,and most popular skill design,  anyway it's great entertainment film , while has unique  northEurope flavor which deserve five star!
B008KZVNLC|3.0|I REALLY wanted to love this movie. I love most everything BBC and I love ANYTHING Benedict Cumberbatch. Sadly, this movie proved me very wrong on both counts. While the cast is beautiful, the scenery equally beautiful, the story is just soooo boring. You can't really feel for anyone in this movie. There are moments where you find yourself pulling for someone and then you get slapped in the face with just how dull and uninteresting their problems really are. The whole movie you are being pushed by the other characters to feel as though Cumberbatchs wife is this vile woman and that he deserves better but in fact, I felt as though SHE was the one who could have done better as he was as fun as watching grass grow. Anyhow, my main thought is this... if it comes on TV, by all means watch it. DON'T buy this though... it's simply not worth the price.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Not really my kind of book, it was the first book I read with my kindle.  I need more suspense and less romance.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book surprised me. I was looking for a book to pass the time on a long flight but it was so well written and engrossing I found myself counting down the hours before I could get back and find out what happened to the main character. Very worth the read, and even more so for the price.
B00A7ZWUJC|3.0|First of all, I like Rihanna's music, in general.  I still think her previous music is better than pretty much everything on this CD.  I feel like the CD, in general, is lacking something - creativity?  I got sick of it really fast which is a bummer, and I thought some of the tracks had very little substance, example, &#34;No Love Allowed,&#34; could have been so much more than it was.  Missed the boat there!  I feel like she started the song off great but never finished it.  That song just didn't scream Rihanna, it seemed like they forgot to finish it.  It lacked the same kind of depth and development most of her other tracks have.  You can hear the difference.  Some of the tracks I thought were really just a waste of space were &#34;Nobody's Business,&#34; and &#34;Pour it Up&#34;.  I don't want to hear about Chris Brown anymore, that's YOUR business, right?  As for &#34;Pour it Up&#34;, I'm a fan of the occasional grimy track about ballin' out, but this was better sang by a man, not by Rihanna.  That sounds sexist, oh well.  Leave the 'throwin' it up' and 'dolla' bills' to the thugs and rappers who don't have anything else to rap about, we're way to oversaturated with that trash.  Hope the next CD is better!
1441979212|5.0|It tells you how to write paper step by step in details.For example,how to structure the framework of papers, what need to be think about when writing the introduction, method and so on.<br />You should not miss it!
B004UO0SAO|1.0|I bought this so I could always have the calculator for my finance class. I have yet been able to use it on my kindle fire. The buttons on the right to add and everything do not work and I regret buying this app.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|World War Z was not only a standout Zombie novel but a very well thought out commentary on how different cultures and nations would handle a disaster. I was originally worried the writing style would keep me from connecting with the story, but that wasn't the case at all. Overall this is hands down my favorite book in both the Zombie and Apocalypse categories, and I'd recommend it to anyone who is considering it.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I got this book because of all the reviews about how hot the first kiss was and the price was not too expensive.  I enjoyed it because I like romantic stories.  The story sort of reminded me of a Tyler Perry movie - very dramatic.  Even so, I wantd to continue reading it so I could see what happened.  The kissing scene was nice, but not so super hot like so many other reviewers indicated.  I think the kissing scene in the first Twilight Movie with Bella and Edward in Bella's room was way hotter.  The kiss is still sexy, but not so sexy that it changed my life or anything, or that I would say it's the best first kiss of all time.  I'm sure there are other first kiss scenes I have yet to see or read about so until I am able to make a fair comparison, I would say it's a good first kiss but not better than Twilight's first kiss scene.
B007SGM084|4.0|It was entertaining, but certainly not the best work I've ever read.  I would rate it 7 out of 10.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|Helen Hunt handled her role in an extremely touching situation that had me mesmerized from the beginning  Couldnt help but shed tears at the end.....very moving portrayal of a real life situation.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Lone survivor.  Outstanding book. Great story. Love our military, and there familes. Good bless America, and all who serve my country.
0393343405|3.0|Really interesting stuff and beautifully written, but it requires full attention. No reading it in little snatches on the subway.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Me and my 4 year old love this app and its awesome that you can choose what puzzles you want to play
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|WOW, great fun. Super graphics, nice music, and loads of neat stuff to look for and try to drive too. I am happy I found this app!
0060936223|5.0|Patti Smith's unapologetic study of her early life, her development as an artist, and her dynamic relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe is funny, sad, and inspiring. She provides a window on an incredible moment in American culture and life in New York City. Like her music, her story is raw and poetic, spontaneous and considered, all at the same time.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|Good movie acting by the leading actors. Eastwood is hard to beat in any role of this nature. If like Eastwood you will like this movie.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Great game but have some issues on my Kindle when trying to connect to Facebook. Really like the game though.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|I must admit that, before hearing this album in its entirety, I was somewhat dreading listening to it.  Steven Wilson's last solo work \\"Grace For Drowning\\" was somewhat underwhelming as was \\"Storm Corrosion\\", his collaboration with Mikael Akerfeldt.  I loved his first solo album \\"Insurgentes\\" and obviously I am a Porcupine Tree fan as is everyone who has posted a review of this current work.  I can state unequivocally, after listening to \\"The Raven That Refused To Sing\\", this album is truly a musical masterpiece and should serve as a notice to all of us that Steven Wilson has undergone a transformation from indie artist with measurable talent to a gifted music maker and collaborator.  \\"Raven...\\" is amazing!  When listening to it I am immediately thrown back to an era of music from the 1970's.  Steven Wilson has managed to capture a spirit of Progressive Rock that has caused some stirring in my lizard brain.  I read that Alan Parsons was the engineer for the recording of this album.  Wow, what a great choice and his choices for accompanying musicians should also be recognized.  Guthrie Govan and Adam Holzman are tremendously talented as well.  The biggest shame, is that 99% of the people who listen to music today will probably never hear this album.  Program radio is God awful and those people who are held captive by it will never know what they're missing out on.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Washington does his normal great job of acting. Special effects are amazing. Story line a little hard to watch but good movie
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Art direction, story and costume design excellent. A must-see for sure.<br />I love the drama, comedy and mystery all in one package.
B009RI4ZKC|3.0|Nothing speical. Watched it because of Willis, but not his typical role. Entertaining but as I said nothing special about this movie.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|Most important thing to know about this volume is that it really is the Complete Sherlock Holmes, in the chronological order in which Conan Doyle wrote them. They are organized within volumes well known to Sherlock Holmes fans, and it is worth it to purchase this edition to obtain the Table of Contents, which makes it clear and easy to see how the stories are organized.<br /><br />Otherwise, these wonderful stories speak for themselves, and the Kindle edition appears to be accurate. I have only read the first dozen or so novellas and stories, but all appear to have been well translated to the Kindle format. It's a pity the drawings from several of the original collections were not included, but obviously people read these stories because of their love for Conan Doyle's immortal Holmes and Watson, and not for the &#34;pictures&#34;. The warts from the original stories remain, such as Conan Doyle forgetting Watson's first name near the beginning of &#34;The Man with the Twisted Lip,&#34; having Watson's own wife call him &#34;James&#34; instead of John. All perfectly forgivable, errors of a different time, and before all the Sherlock stories were collected in one or two volumes and could be read in a short period of time, rather than over the course of many years, the way Conan Doyle wrote them.<br /><br />The stories still hold up remarkably well, and are great fun, in spite of all the Sherlock Holmes movies, and now TV shows, that have sent him in innumerable directions never intended by Conan Doyle. Although he no doubt would have a good chuckle over all of them. If you are a fan of the original Sherlock Holmes (and Watson), and want to own the full set in your Kindle, you cannot go wrong with this set.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Movie was hit or miss the first time I saw it, I wasn't too sure what I thought. When I had the opportunity to see it again I really enjoyed this movie and decided to order it and watch it a third time and add it to my collection.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I think I picked this book because I was interested in how the author was going to pull this one off. I was suprising pleased. Lots of twist and turns leaving the ending a little unpredictable.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|First Season is AMAZING! Not a fan at all of the second season. DVD was brand new and came wrapped and in perfect condition. I watched it as soon as I received it.
B00009R86L|4.0|My computer bag is always very heavy because I carry so much in it - This pad does a good job at distributing the weight on my shoulder and padding it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game that keeps you moving and it I'd not easy but a challenge so it lasts a long time playing.
0385349947|5.0|This book has a lot of controversy around it, but I personally enjoyed it, and more so than I had anticipated. I don't think I'd put the title \\"manifesto\\" on it, but she offered some really good advice and thought-provoking points. All her advice and commentary is rooted in her personal experiences. I like that she sticks to what she knows (her own life) instead of taking the one-size-fits-all position for gender equality, but it also means that not every paragraph of every chapter resonated perfectly with MY life. That said, I still got a lot out of it and am really happy I read it. I just recommend having that expectation going in.<br /><br />It's a short, quick read. Her voice is funny and kind and humble. As a young professional woman, I value the advice of a woman who has made it to the top. I don't think it addresses every issue of gender inequality (and honestly, I like that it doesn't.), but it's a piece of the puzzle and I highly recommend every man and woman give it a shot.<br /><br />Finally, I LOVE that the book is designed to be a launching point into public discourse. The website/Facebook page are evidence that the book is just the beginning and I think that's awesome! I love the Lean In Circles!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Very short but great graphics. The story line was intriguing. The music and sound effects are creepy. But the game was easy to follow. I just wish it would have gone on for longer.
B0092C2X7U|4.0|I really like this game. I downloaded the free on first not realizing it was just a demo. But I figure it's free so I would play as far as I could that's that. Well for 99 cents i had to keep playing. Will want more went I finish this game.
B00BI73CVI|2.0|Overall performance was great. The entire movie was in song and I got bored. I know it's a musical, I usually like musicals, I was just hoping it would be more interesting, given all the reviews.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Great book. Great lessons for life. This is a book you will want to pass down ans read over and over again.
B000FA675C|4.0|A lot of conjecture but a good story and interesting read. It prompted me to further investigate the validity of the subject!
B004PR71JC|5.0|I like that my kids listen to different types of music, not  that pop 40 crap on the radio.  There are songs that fit top 40, but overall, the soundtrack is fantastic!
B002TLSSXO|5.0|Great Buy.  I loved the way they looked and the colors that they came in.  What a great idea for cooking
B008C20TDG|5.0|I had heard about the whole30 from friends of mine that are big into crossfit and had done it themselves.  I considered myself a healthy eater until I started this program...whoa.<br />I am not 17 days into my whole30 and I've never felt better
B000FA675C|3.0|As a thriller, Dan Brown got The Da Vinci Code just right.  As a historical novel, it's off in a few places, as is his geography.  If you can suspend your disbelief enough to get through that, though, quite an enjoyable read!
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Hasn't everyone seen this already?  It's unique and yet another classic from Clint Eastwood capitalizing on his advanced age and spinning a fantastic movie around that
B00BW5K5DO|4.0|I LOVE THE GAME.  IT IS ALOT OF FUN  BUT IF FREEZES UP FOR A FEW SECONDS AT A TIME.
B000FA675C|5.0|such a wonderful book that really makes you think!! I thoroughly enjoyed it!  I highly recommend it... could these events truly happen our have happened...we'll never know...
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Remarkable story of hardship overcome by courage and will power. A tale of the will to survive and never losing faith.
B001FB0WBK|5.0|Tommy Emmanuel is absolute genius!! We've watched this concert several times with different friends and are still amazed that one person can get such varied music from one instrument.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of the Vince Flynn novels and everytime I am impatiently waiting for the next one to come out. Flynn's style of writing allows for an easy flow yet is detailed so that you can picture every scene in your mind. I have recommended the Mitch Rapp series to dozens of family and friends and every one of them has completed the entire series and loved it. Keep them coming, can't get enough of Mitch Rapp!
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Really could get into this. Visually great and locales also. Recommend this to those that like and action film. Not as contrived bloody mess as many strife to in this day and time. Historical accurate, not so much. But that is with all films of this type.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Just lots of little things to make it enjoyable.<br />Really like eating the swimmers, and the sign up on the beach makes me laugh.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I enjoyed this book, but it was too predictable. There wasn't enough dramatic moments or \\"catch you by surprise\\" moments. The characters were a little bland and too innocent. However, overall enjoyable.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I love the game but, i don't like all of the ads at the end and the begining of every game its very annoying.
0920668372|5.0|My mom's friend suggested this book to her when I was a kid. I bought this to read to my son and still can't get through it without choking up.
B0017HEYEI|1.0|my husband and daughter sat down to watch this last week and were very unhappy with the subtitled movie.  It was a challenge even to get the english subtitles to appear.
B00BHU9BV6|5.0|It's an artsy film, but in a very good way. The outfits are excellent, the acting is very good [including Keira Knightly who I normally do not like] and the story moves along ~ I am going to buy the film as I definitely will want to see it again
B007BFSYMS|2.0|I had a hard time navigating this app. I also found it hard to shut off and I kept feeling like this app was taking over my phone. I didn't know how to control it.
B00000DUE7|5.0|As a listener and non professional musician I find Vivaldi's Choral works the most pleasing of all. This sort of music is also good for brain plasticity and neurogenesis.<br />Dr Robert Wentworth,<br />Sydney.
B007SGM084|5.0|I love that I can have this on my kindle and on the go. It helps me keep my hard copy books uber protected and I still get to read it wherever I am!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Hi guys and ladies! This was/is a great virtual horse game with decent graphical features. Try it for yourself :) just got my kindle Fire HD tablet btw. Very happy with it so far. Like I said though, very good game. Looks so real! :D
B008IJT0CE|5.0|So much better than sleeping with the TV on.  I like that you can mix and match sounds (and control the volume of each one individually).  Good customer service by the developer.  I sent a question and got a very quick reply.  I liked the free version so well, I upgraded to the paid version.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is a really great free app.....  my kids love it . Graphics great.  Earn coins to get better cars and power ups
141659521X|5.0|The only problem with Vince Flynn books is he hasn't learned to write as fast as I read.<br />I enjoyed this book...as well as his others.
B00BL5EQLC|3.0|The Grudger is an ok download, challenging levels, ok music, real funny rag doll death sound affects, completely free, I got it as free app of the day. The swipe controls sometimes don't respond well. And the game gets repetitive after completing all the levels, survival mode becomes boring fast. I don't think that this game should have a price it should become a free app because it just doesn't have enough levels and activities in it to keep someone playing.
0307594777|4.0|In order to really understand everything about this series, you absolutely have to read all three books in order to form an<br />opinion about them.  There are some parts that are perhaps a bit uncomfortable for some people and you should take<br />that into account, but I enjoyed the series, thought the characters were very well developed and the plot excellent.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Omfg!!!!! This book is so good!!!!! If you are married, about to get married, pregnant, about to get pregnant or all of the above then you should totally read this book!!! This book deserves 5 stars baby!!!!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Game is so cool first time playing this game and can't get over how fun and awesome it looks game play is smooth graphics are incredible highly recommend it
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Great feel good movie with cute plot and funny characters. I recommend this movie and hope to buy the soundtrack.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is my &#34;easy&#34; work out video of the week! I've only been doing this for about 3 weeks and have not weighed myself at all so I don't know if there has been a weight difference, but I do know that now thank to Jillian, I have much more energy throughout the day and I'm feeling good! Thanks again Jillian! I highly recommend this to anyone out there who needs a doable work out! I started at 175. I'll see if my weight goal of 140 is reached!
B003629IPW|5.0|Great movie. Interesting to get a glimpse into his concert preparations and the process of how a concert is made.
B00821OX98|5.0|Aliens killing people, people killing aliens. Aliens forming rebellions against aliens......  What's the universe coming to? You guessed it, RATINGS!!!  Hope to see it for years to come.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I didn't think that a book about a long walk would be able to hold my interest, but as I read it, I found myself fairly entranced. Joyce doesn't let Harold's journey take the expected path, and though there were things that I wanted to have happen in the book, it is better because it didn't. The narrative is about Harold's journey across England, but the book is about the journey of life, and it resonates for all of us.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Why can't there be another kindle fire game like this? It is so awesome I totally recommend it! It is AWESOME
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Maybe my expectations were too high, but I thought this was just so-so. The book just isn't that funny. Which is strange, because on TV I find her to be hilarious.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Interesting novel that allows one to suspend his/her disbeliefe and be entertained.  Interesting dynamic between Heat and Rook that will have to be solidified at some point in time.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|This venerable series has taken on new life in recent years.  The writers have woven a compelling, emotional story of friends thrown into the most amazing situations.  The Dr Who world promises to continue to thrill in future seasons.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This was a lovely book with a beautiful ending.  Like the Shawshank Redemption; worth it all for the last few seconds.
B008LA7RM0|5.0|By his own admission, George Martin modeled the Beatles' Sgt. Peppers after this Beach Boys tour de force.  Completed one year BEFORE Sgt. Peppers, Pet Sounds contains many of the production techniques later used by the Beatles' producer. But genius always needs an inspiration, and Brian Wilson found that in the Phil Spector productions of the mid 60s.  You can hear Mr. Spector's production values in every note of Pet Sounds.  This album sits smack-dab in the middle of the 60's music revolution, and is a bridge to many subsequent pop music styles.<br /><br />If you missed it the first time around, this is a good opportunity to hear an album that was instrumental in the evolution of the Beatles' sound.  The inclusion of stereo mixes, along with the original mono versions,s gives the listener extra clarity to hear all the production nuances.<br /><br />Pet Sounds is one of the most important records of the 60s.  Listening to it 50 years later only serves to show just how important it really was.
B0018BF1LS|5.0|Surrealistic Pillow and Crown Of Creation are absolute classic albums. All five are good reproductions of the originals. I've pretty much worn out my old vinyls, so I was very pleased with this set.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a fantastic series! I stumbled upon these books looking for some good post apocalyptic science fiction and sure found it. I'm a little nervous that I'll never find anything quite like t,his again but at the same time so gratified that I did find it. Kinda coming off a Wool readathon high here! Hugh Howey you sir are the man!  Thanks for the read and I look forward too checking out your other works.
0451213092|5.0|This is a great book!  It's a fascinating look into the true story rescue mission mounted by Ross Perot to free two of his EDS-Iran employees taken hostage by the Iranian government in the very early days of the its Islamic revolution. What is particularly interesting is the glimpse that we get into the \\"can-do\\" personalities of the rescue team members and EDS executive support staff.<br /><br />I couldn't put this book down.  It is well written, detailed and informative. My only criticism is that I would have preferred an larger Epilog section.  For example: what happened to Rashid and Dadgar?
B00AWBNNAG|2.0|I recently bought the Lego haunted house.  I downloaded this app in hopes to have an extra booklet, but it was not on this app.  This is the reason I gave it a 2 star rating.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|So slow! I loved Lord of the Rings book and movie and the Hobbit book.  But this is like when you're supposed to write a ten-page paper in college, but all you've got in 3 pages, so you fluff it out.....I'll skip the next two, or watch them on high speed!
B004EPYSN2|5.0|Marion zimmer Bradley is a fantastic story teller and character developer. This book is full of intriguing yet flawed characters.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I enjoy playing this game.  I find it challenging, and fun.  The add on's are worth it - and add more of a challenge.
B004UPALT6|4.0|It's nice to watch a horror movie that doesn't give you nightmares.  They must have had fun making this movie.  It's a combination zombie/ghost story and has lots of blood squirting around, people sucked away by the evil wind and even  a witch in the basement.  Made no sense at all, but that's ok.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I've only read 3 or 4 of the Reacher series but I like this one best so far. Something for everyone.
B009VMN3RA|2.0|First half of book was interesting; second half was very dry.  Felt as if Sachi's adult life was not part of this book.  What happened to her marriage?  More about her parenting skills with her children?  What did she learn from her mother and her childhood?  I felt let down in the second half of the book.  It just stopped.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, it is different than most books I read.  The Night Circus has all the elements of fantasy and romance. The characters are great and the description is amazing!
B00B6QXN56|4.0|unbelievable performance, great price and recording. I had everyone in the office moving some part of their body but quietly
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|great movie. too bad one has to wait 3 years to get the complete trilogy. great special effects and character continuance of the Lord of Ring series.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|J rick and the ground floor to the ground up to the power of a new study shows that you are a new comment by the sims so that you can see the sims free
B000FC12SM|4.0|This book is really good...I'd recommend it to anyone that is trying to understand their spouse..the only thing I don't like is that they are compared as people from Venus and Mars...it does get a little confusing. However, that is the context of the books it is expected. Hopefully the tactics in this book can help me with my relationship
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game has every thing like building and living. they also are coming out with a new one 7.0 that u can play on a server without having to be right next to your friend and be playing it you can play at home and so can your friends. this game is the best out of all!
B0043RGXJS|3.0|I thought this CD would've been better, as he's incredibly talented.  Disappointed in the selection on here - have other CD's / digital music by Michael Buble and there much better.
B008476HBM|5.0|Jane Austen is one of my all time favourite authors! Pride and Prejudice is a fantastic romantic novel, it deserves all of the praise and fame it has attracted in the centuries since its publication. I couldn't recommend a better book!
6303327982|5.0|I'v loved the movie Natural Born Killers since I first saw it. And to have it on VHS is a true honor. If i could describe it, I would say it's like Bonnie and Clyde of the 80s on steroids. Mickey and Mallory deffinatley earned there spot in the serial killer hall of fame. Who cares how much violence is in it. The violence makes it all the more awesome. Over all its one of the greatest movies ever made.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|when I picked up this book on Kindle I was on vacation with my 14 year old daughter and 12 year old son. Thinking that it could be an interesting read, I found that the book was mostly disturbing rather than interesting. I used to be a psychotherapist and have worked with clients in the criminal justice system so it was almost like reading something that could have been applied in my life except for the fact that my son hasn't been accused of murder nor would I allow a psychiatrist to make a judgment call about my kid based on questionable science. Nonetheless while interesting, it was disturbing that a book would promote the use of a \\"murder gene\\" to determine guilt or innocence when there are so many other factors that play a role. I know this is fiction but someone most assuredly will read this and take it as fact. In the end, without giving the end away, I believe it is more disturbing than entertaining.
B0034G4ORC|4.0|As pointed out in one of the highlighted reviews, this is only superficially a war against the aliens movie: it is an urban combat  film. Aliens are about the  only safe foe to choose these days for such a film, without raising somebody's  political hackles. I have never (to  my knowledge) seen any of these actors before, but they handle their jobs quite well.  The star is excellent. I can't comment on the verisimilitude of any of the combat hardware ( of our side) but it looked good as did the marine's responses to the tactical situation. There were cliche's,<br />of course, but that is just shorthand for experienced viewers to insert the appropriate behavior and respond to that rather than to the symbol which represents it. Actually, little time was consumed in such sidebars to the flow of violence (which is what combat is all about),<br />In sum, I was quite happy to have taken advantage of the skimpy price at which the disc is selling right now. I commend it to anyone with an urge to  view modern battle without enduring the sight of real people really suffering the death and shattered bodies that reality imposes.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Fun and easy to play. None of the problems you find with other simulation games. Love it!! Definitely worth the price.
B008J34466|5.0|Filled with lots of up tempo songs, fun to sing along to in the car.  Even the slow songs are super good and pretty.  I'd never think of Pink as a &#34;pretty&#34; voice, but she totally is.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Primarily we bout this 3 cover to protect our IPhones and you have to believe me this cover really protect your IPhone has you see in all the advertisement, but the protection doesn’t mean that we can’t use the IPhone functionalities<br />The IPhone inside of the cover enclosure used as a phone the audio quality it’s very bad the people doesn’t hear you well and you hear the people in a robotic or metallic way and if you try to use the speakerphone the things turn it worst!!!<br />The plug adapter for your headphones broke in a short time of use If you want to hear your music using the speakerphones… mmm… please don’t do that it’s the same thing that trying to hear it with the phone under the water<br />I bought 3 of this covers at the end of January, two month later all of them are broken, my daughter and I stared to pull out of the cover for use ours phones or to listen music and it stared to damage in the corners and at the flipped parts<br />Im also buy two sport band and with the cover broken those are useless<br /><br />Simple I don’t recommend this expensive product!!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is full of twist and turn with boosters to make u go father and survive. The only thing is it has a option of buying coins with real money. I have not because omit is a waste of money to but, it is very tempting. Over all dispite the one bad thing this is a great and addictive game.
B005HEJ2DK|3.0|I enjoy all Star Trek TV series, and this season Enterprise finally tried to get some direction. Didn't quite make it, obviously, but worth reliving.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This version of AB is good.  I like the holiday themes. Playing is fun if you don't mind being assaulted with ads.
B00BJS7LHC|2.0|This movie doesn't cut the muster. Being a Black American, I understand the subject matter, but I honestly think that it shouldn't have been shown as a comedy, which failed miserably. This was a serious time in our history, and should have been portrayed as such.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Not only was this book heartfelt and thrilling, it also has a few twists and turns that kept me frantically turning pages all hours of the night. Another fantastic success for Nicholas Sparks.
B0094K1WZE|3.0|Way too much action which was unbelievable. Also, plot got lost, and eventually got boring. IM has worn out its welcome, IMHO.
1616550414|5.0|My twin 13-year-old daughters who discovered the Legend of Zelda a couple of years ago with games on the Wii and Nintendo handheld units, became obsessed to the point of doing drawings and animations and the like. When this book appeared, I asked them if they were interested and received a resounding &#34;yes!&#34;. Well, the book definitely didn't disappoint. They can't put the thing down, continuing to review drawings and attempting to emulate the style in many areas. A couple of their friends are enjoying it as well, when they visit. I would bet that any &#34;Zelda completist&#34; will love this tome.
B00985E3UG|4.0|Fascinating book on how the food industry manipulates consumers. Anyone who has tried to lose weight should read this book.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I just feel the app is slow on my kindle. It is faster on my Iphone but I still utilize it.
B009RX7WTI|5.0|I love love greys anatomy... Im looking forward for the complete season 9... Ive watched season 1 to 8 on netflix
030759565X|5.0|I love cookbooks. I love reading them and trying new recipes. Smitten Kitchen is a awesome book!<br />I just don't like the layout of the recipes. I lost my spot a few times and would have the re-read the recipe to find out where I left off. Not a huge problem but I get frustrated easily ;)
B00B52F278|5.0|So I reviewed season one and the prequel Gods of the Arena, and gave them both five stars. So let me skip to season three, and say as a dedicated fan from the very first episode, it's still a great show. Um, and it's still gay porn. Yeah, OK, there's naked women, too, (like one for every three naked men,) but that's not why I watch this show. No...not for the nude men, either, (I heard you thinking that you pervert!) Just kidding. You're not a pervert if you watch any of these shows. Like I said in my first review of season one, despite the porn, (the GAY porn,) it's still one hell of a great show.<br /><br />I'm a lover of anything Roman Empire. I'm not a youngster anymore, and I don't get thrills from seeing nude women. (Never was thrilled about nude men.) But the cast and the production and the writing and the everything over the top works for this show. Yes, even the porn. Or is it porn? Hey, I don't look too carefully, it's like I don't hit pause and study the naked actors or actresses, I mean, but I'd swear those are fake bushes on those nude women. I mean in season three, especially. It sure looks like those are female pubic hair toupees, if you will. And I've read several comments that the male members are prosthetics, too. But that's not the point. I don't care about any of that.<br /><br />What I do care about is a punk teenager, (son of Crassus,) raping Julius Caesar. I mean, come on. Yeah, I know the producers are taking liberties, and even though Caesar had no historical participation in the Spartacus wars, they thought it would be a good idea to include him. But as this punk's biatch? Now, you're talking perverted. But you know what? According to the writings of Gaius Marius, any type of homosexuality in the legions was a capital crime. So that's taking their \\"liberties\\" a little too far. But they're taking everything too far. And like I said many times, and in many different ways, it works for this show. Spartacus will be missed. At least I'll miss it. Until the next Roman historical show comes on. Maybe that show about Leonardo will be good. I'll be watching it. Fingers crossed!
B005BGBPBG|5.0|The movie was great but I read the book prior to the movie and did too much comparing.<br />I wish the movie was EXACTLY like the book but I know that never happens..
B009KEN87O|5.0|It takes me back to when I was younger... love the old school graphics.  Keeps 6 years old boy entertained
B000FA675C|4.0|The Da Vinci Code, is a great beach or airline read. It is entertaining, fun and the plot idea is excellent. The twist can be seen from a mile away and the prose is average at best, so this book will never be one of the greats.<br /><br />As a &#34;time-pass&#34; book, it is one of the best.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the whole series, Couldn't wait for the next one.  I hope el james writes more novels very soon.
0446554995|5.0|It's a Preston Graves books, what's not to like!  It's a sad and exciting story all at once with our favorite eccentric FBI Agent. character.  I can't wait for another to carry on the story line.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A very great book I read it in 3days I just could not put it down. I would defiantly recommend to anyone

B00BP4X7TG|5.0|What a terrific film.  I wouldn't have known about it but for my brother's recommendation.  Funny, uplifting, moving.  I highly recommend this movie!!
B005QBBCMI|4.0|Its a well acted movie about a sad man's downward spiral who actually fines a small taste of happiness.  Elizabeth is delightful and gloriously seductive
B009YMNVMO|4.0|Nice movie. Funny, funny, funny. Great animation. Sure to be enjoyed by kids and parents alike. I like it a lot
B000FA675C|5.0|This book was suspenseful and very well written. Dan Brown is an excellent writer and I would highly recommend this book.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|Nice app, but so far I have one gripe because when I dock my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 to my cradle it auto launches this app even though I didn't set it up that way.  I checked the app settings and there's no way to turn it off and I reset all of my app settings on the tablet and it still didn't work. A little annoying.
B00A757EFW|2.0|Very  much like to original arcade version.  it just stinks that after reaching a certain score you can no longer play til you pay for the full version.
B0010YPTGU|5.0|I have all of  Andrea's concerts on DVD now and am going to try to get the latest one in Porto Vino when it comes out.  There is  nothing like sitting back and taking in the beauty and majesty of Bocelli's performances along with the scenery, the orchestrations and guest musicians and singers. All of it is done up 100% in style and classiness. It makes me feel rich in soul to hear and watch these concerts. I listen to them over and over.  Bravo!<br />Connie Geron
B003TSEEDY|5.0|literally the best book i have ever read. amazing how awesome of a writer he is, needs a 2nd book!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great show,  I bought season 1 on DVD and it has been borrowed over 12 times.  I am a Downton Abbey dealer,  getting people addicted !
B00C1BU8G2|1.0|This movie is terrible. It does no justice to the original film. Lost World was a much better film than JP 3, it is even comparable to the original film. Up until the disastrous Hollywood \\"let's have dinosaurs in California\\" scene and the awkward news cast at the end of the film.<br />  Well this film is a 92 minute extension of that disastrous Lost World ending. Most of the acting in this film is so over done a that a burnt steak look rare. The CGI is also very bad. Jurassic Park was made in 1993 and the CGI in that film still ranks among the best. The shading and textures in that film are some of most realistic out there even still. What a great accomplishment in the early 90's. Jurassic Park III just does this series an injustice. The story line had some real potential; but for some reason this story translated from script to film all wrong and it mutated into something unexpected. When watching this movie, it leaves an empty feeling and cheap taste. Many scenes were just wrong or dumb. How could the sound of a phone inside a Spinosaurus echo throughout a forest? The ending raptor scene just not a good logical climatic ending made me feel like \\"that was it?\\" For 93 million dollar movie it could have been much better.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is another Colleen's great story!  Very dense and truly beautiful.  Holder is someone to be hold!  I enjoyed immensely this book.  Just think that Sky's friends, Six and Breckin, got kind of lost as they never learned about her true story.
1883217040|5.0|Great information.  Enough content in this book for the intermediate jazz student to study for a LONG time.  I highly recommend this book.
B00004CXYQ|5.0|Even after watching this move three times over the last few years I am still amazed at the artistic ability of the characters; not only in the movie but in real life...like Geoffrey Rush!<br />I also own the soundtrack and play it often.<br />I can't say enough about how much I love this movie.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Great characters, great story.  Set was beautiful.  Kept us &#34;glue&#34; to the TV and could hardly wait for the next episode.<br />Sad when the series ended.
1250012570|5.0|I'm sitting here wondering how a girl like me, a total HEA kind of gal, can read this book and the only word that comes to mind is PERFECTION. The writing style is flawless. The characters are more authentic than any I've ever read. The emotions are almost physical in their nature. This book is just fabulous.<br /><br />Park's mom is written with a frightening degree of accuracy. She is the embodiment of my Korean mother-in-law, if Lee were an Avon sales lady from the 1980's.<br /><br />Park is the unequaled in the world of fiction. He has a sharp dislike for Eleanor at first and has a tendency to be outright rude to her. As we learn more about Park, we see that his initial reaction to Eleanor is a direct result to being half Asian in a predominately white environment. He didn't understand why she would dress in a way that makes her stand out, a complaint he ponders often in the beginning. To someone who has spent his life trying to fit in, her choices are a mystery. As the story moves forward, Park begins to accept and eventually love these very qualities about Eleanor. It is these seemingly outrageous decisions that cause him to tell her that she's the bravest person that he knows.<br /><br />And Eleanor...God bless Eleanor in all of her Big Red crazy-haired glory. It is through Eleanor's character and Park's reactions to her that I was able to think back to the early days of dating my husband and see what it is that he was able to see in me.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|One of my favorite shows. I love to watch it over and over again. Picture quality and sound were great.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|This is a very inspirational book.  I would recommend this to anyone, man or woman.  Great book to select for a corporate book club.

B004XZR63M|4.0|My husband told me I should read this book and I am glad he did. We are now on our way to becoming financially free. From a literary aspect this book started slow and was bait confusing but I soon adjusted to the style.
B004TI5N38|3.0|slow moving, predictable outcomes<br />Zero Day is not, in my opinion, one of Baldacci's<br />suspence, driven novels. I, however, did enjoy it<br />for the most part.

B007UWBQEU|5.0|What can I say?  It's Carrie Underwood!  She has an amazing vocal range, perfect pitch and a very strong voice.  This is considered country music, but I overlook that fact and listen to it just due to her amazing voice.  This album is just as good as her earlier ones and should easily sell a bazillion copies!  There are at least three hit songs from this album already and who knows how many more will come from it.  You can't go wrong purchasing a copy of this music.
B008RTE09S|4.0|As others have said, the blu-ray of MMT is a nicely restored product, far superior in image and sound than any previous DVD. The picture is not perfect, e.g., not extremely sharp in all places, but it was made for TV in the 1960s so that should be expected. The extras are fun as well with interviews from Paul and Ringo and previous interviews from George and John. But one thing that bothered me... I enjoyed the mini-bios of the supporting cast but where was the entry for Mandy Weet/Miranda Forbes who played Wendy Winters? She easily had as many lines and scenes as the others and for my money was the best looking gal in the film. Though she's passed on it would have been nice to see her included, perhaps with a bit from her later TV career. Oh well. If you are a Beatles fan or at all interested in this rather odd little film, buy nothing other than the blu-ray. One star deducted for general TV quality of print.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This is a well written book with a very interesting plot. Liked the whole thing! Will recommend it to friends.
B00A7WZZ74|5.0|This record is crisp and clear with rich bass. Everyone who likes vinyl should have this in their collection. Thanks
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Another reviewer noted how easy the early levels are.  That's just a means of luring you in.  Later levels are quite challenging, yet you know the solution is there...just around the next bend.  Great game!
0670026638|3.0|Picking up this book, I thought this was going to be a story about the fascinating life of the rebellious great grandmother who also happens to be a buddhist nun, instead the main focus ended up being the life of a bullied teenager in Tokyo (not what was promised on the cover). I also agree with one other reviewer who thought that the \\"Ruth interjections\\" were not particulary helpful to the story.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book, I love to read the details you don't get to see in the movies!!<br /><br />The author is wonderful:)
B00BI5IXL4|4.0|The singing and acting is not stellar, but it is very 'real' and less 'hollywood'. We thoroughly enjoyed the film!
1416572295|5.0|After hearing about this book for so long I thought I would buy it to read. And it was worth it. A really fun book from start to finish with a great story. I think the dog is a genius. The description of the physics was really good and Chad Orzel made the task for explaining quantum physics very easy for myself to understand. It was a clever way to teach people about complex matters of physics in a simple and light approach. I learnt a lot from it and take away some good thoughts about science.
B0078Q2HAA|5.0|While I did not agree with MT on many of her political positions, I have to admire her spirit and determination.  This movie captures her rise to power, and the sad decline of her later years.  Meryl Streep is wonderful!
B00BRR66SA|4.0|But then again that is what I have come to expect from Justin. He is so refreshing in this CD mixing a 90's R&B style with a poppy hip hop feel... Did I say sexy! His lyrics are so sexually charged throughout this CD that features longer, more complex songs and melodies. I loved it!
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Seriously, this movie has never looked more amazing. the sure don't make 'em like this anymore (sadly)<br /><br />This blu ray is worth its weight in gold...
B000AP04NI|5.0|We had this recorded off TV but watching it on the HD tv was LAME! This recording is fabulous even i it isnt blu ray!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I love this movie. It is very upbeat and humorously tongue-in-cheek. I wish they had included more outtakes but I was happy with the purchase.
B001RHPJBU|4.0|Love the classic 80s Jams... Phil... Genesis. Before Or After... I am a fan! Gotta have that music to reminisce from.
038533348X|4.0|I walked into Cat's Cradle unknowing of the brilliance that is Vonnegut. I was browsing through the Classics section searching for some 20th century literature [that isn't Kerouac] and chanced upon a collection of mid-life works of Kurt Vonnegut. I'd only heard his name before, and read a few letters, but Cat's Cradle was the first work of fiction of his I read.<br /><br />I didn't realize this was a sci-fi novel. The first few pages reminded me of Ayn Rand, preaching me some philosophy that was self-made and obnoxious. I didn't understand the point of going through the[se seemingly irrelevant] events of John's life as a writer. I went as far as to almost skip the vignette on how ice-nine works! (If you haven't read it yet, don't skip that part!) I knew that I liked the book, I just didn't understand how it all tied together. It was about page 100 (out of ~130, in my dictionary-styled collection) that I saw all of the events, information, and narration coming together. And boy, was it glorious!<br /><br />The climax had me eager for the ending, but when I finally reached the final page, I was shocked at how sudden it was. This isn't to say it's bad, it's actually quite good. I can't help but feel that every line has an underlying meaning to it, especially the ending. To appease this, I definitely need to read more into the reasons for the book's genesis, along with the philosophies and activism of the author, and come back for a re-read.<br /><br />Overall, it was a quick read (3 days) that had so much more to offer than expected. It exhibits the brevity and cynicism that I absolutely adore in 20th century lit, and although the author bio starts with \\"Like his idol Mark Twain,\\" Cat's Cradle is infinitely superior to The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. I never got to the end of that one.
B001BIMYXQ|5.0|Love the old jams for sure! Sweet Dreams...classic! So much of this music I grew up listening to or hearing played around... I soaked it up like a sponge.
B00BG08FKK|4.0|The DVD of Les Miserables, like viewing the show in the theater, is a shattering experience. The performances are SO good. But here, divorced from the visuals, some singers don't hold up to their competition in the multiple other performances.<br /><br />Four people are problems.  Russell Crowe is a stolid Javert.  That can be an asset, but like Carreras in Bernstein's recording of West Side Story, singing the right rhythms doesn't mean giving a detailed account of what the character is all about. He is too wooden.  Unfortunately Hugh Jackman is absolutely right on the money stylistically, but, particularly in the first ten minutes or so, is thin of voice and sounds hard pressed. &#34;Bring Him Home&#34; should have improved greatly, but here the difficulties of casting the role come to the fore.  It is both low baritone and lyric tenor. Jackman tries very hard, but doesn't succeed on all counts in a strictly vocal comparison with others.<br /><br />Sascha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter are not the joys they should be.  HBC seems out of her element here vocally, and Cohen is so busy chewing up scenery that he creates almost no impression at all (and what impression he does is negative). I find Hathaway, Redmayne and Seyfried beautifully sung and acted.  Redmayne's performance of &#34;Empy Chairs&#34; actually carries over in strictly vocal means the impression he made in the visual.<br /><br />The crown scenes (Do you hear the people - particularly) have wonderful depth of sound.  The show is complete, unless some strictly musical interludes under dialogue were eliminated.

B00A6PD9I4|4.0|We all enjoyed the spirited character, the action, the fun. From grandmother to mother to daughter, it was a hit all the way around
B001KZG99A|5.0|This is great!  I love Robert Downey Jr. in this role.  The CGI is first rate and it has good action with subtle humor.
B001HDWKMA|5.0|I've owned Trouble since it came out years ago and I even bought Till the Sun turns Black but I think I read a bad review or something silly like that and I've been missing out because of that.  This album is quieter than Trouble but it packs just as much soul and heat.  Buy it and love it

B00AB0Z88S|4.0|We enjoyed it very much.  Color much better when not viewed in 3D. A great adventure with good graphics and scenery.
B008476HBM|4.0|As a non-native English speaker I found the first half very difficult to understand, however the second half is much easier to read. Definitely a book all people must read!
B005HEPL8K|5.0|Gotta love Star Trek The Next Generation. I enjoy the whole series and I could watch reruns for years to come.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Very addicting.  Also a good microcosm of commercial enterprise demonstrating the interdependence of goods and commodities.  A good option would be to turn off the Facebook interface.
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|I think my title says it all. What a awesome album. More pop than rock but it works for just the three of them.
B00007FOMP|5.0|Incredible album by an incredible artist.  The music is as fresh and relevant today as it was when released over 40 years ago.  It is simply one of the greatest albums that I have ever heard.
B000001GPX|5.0|These Beethoven Symphony pieces are excellent for relaxation and healing. I listen to this music in the background and it is always soothing. My favorite is Symphony 2, but both are excellent. This music helps to keep away the stress. I highly recommend listening to it in your car, in the background at work (soft), at home, and while laying in bed to unwind. The Beethoven Symphony 2 even seems to help me to feel better if I feel ill. Someone mentioned to me that this the Symphony 2 really resonates with humankind and I believe it does from my own experience in listening to it!

1439153663|1.0|I resent an author using sentiment to keep me interested and committed to her book.  How about beautiful writing, language, unique characters, a little history and some facts.  This women is not a great, or even good author.  I will carefully avoid ever reading another book she writes,
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|The movie is basically all talking, no action.  What makes it captivating is Daniel Day-Lewis's performance.  There are other great performances in this film but he's the one you can't take your eyes off. He is the reason why this movie should be watched.  Wonderful.
B00B5A9FOG|2.0|The sound on the Merline episodes is awful - barely can hear it.  I got one and sent it back for this reason and got the second one only slightly better. I had to get right up to the TV to hear it.  The sound in the preliminary parts of the dvd are fine, but not the episodes. I would like a dvd that has episodes that I can hear.  Is that possible?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had seen  the movie before I read the book and really liked it but the book is that much better! It goes into more detail and you understand more if what is going on.  Can't wait to start on the next one!
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Solid book with a real vision, but never knocked me out.  I would definitely recommend, especially if you're looking for easy to digest hard sci-fi.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|It's a good game. The graphics are well put together and the game is pretty fun. It's really addicting when you play it 4 a while!
B00AFEY354|5.0|this is my favorite movie of all time! The actors and actresses make you feel like you are a part of the story that is on your tv. This move really followed the book. now when ever i read the book i can picture the actors and actresses of this movie, it feels like they were made for their parts.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Really great book once I started reading it I couldn't put it down.  Great love story!!  I would highly recommend!!

B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I haven't used it that much, but nice to have one on my Kindle.  I,m sure I will be pleased.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I do not mind reading a book that is a movie - do it all the time in either order.  The movie is not this exact book made into a movie, but it clearly has a lot of overlap.  This offers the POV of a seal and not the female agent.  She is referenced in it of course.<br /><br />But the book, while a great page turner, does not offer anything important or significant over the movie IMHO.  It does cover that many more seals shot the body which was not totally covered in the movie, but in reality that is a detail that does not change the story.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|I need to know the time in several zones this does not allow me to see more than one time zone.

B0000042MY|5.0|This is simply beautiful music I can picture certain parts of the movie just listening to this cd! Received before stated time Don't know why it took me so long to order it Good service too!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This book went way beyond my wildest dream! I won't ruin this book at all, but it was simply an amazing ending to the series!
B001NHNG64|4.0|The book kept my interested. I was constantly evaluating the characters and trying to figure out who was leaking information. I will probably read one more book using Jack Reacher in hopes that the themes are not too close to Books 1 and 2.
B0084U0IEG|2.0|I loved all Ian Mcewan books except I haven't read Solar yet in this one I was missing the intrigue and tension which made the previous books interesting I kept waiting for more surprise and in the end I asked myself that is it?
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I kept trying to figure out stradegies that could be used against the bad guys.  I like the fact that the book was dealing with money and not drugs.
B0019N95IK|2.0|\\"Star Trek: Enterprise - Season One\\"  is set in the early days of the Earth's exploration of the universe.  The year is 2151 and the Vulcans have reluctantly released star charts to the humans, enabling them to navigate deep space.  Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula), the commanding officer of the starship Enterprise, is a charismatic leader with an insatiable curiosity who inspires tremendous loyalty among his crew.  At the time of \\"Enterprise,\\" technology is not nearly as advanced as in the \\"Star Trek\\" series, set further in the future.  Many aspects of space travel are, for the people of Earth, works in progress.<br /><br />In the expansive \\"Star Trek\\" franchise -- both on the big and small screens -- \\"Enterprise\\" was the last TV series, coming long after the successes of \\"The Next Generation,\\" \\"Deep Space Nine,\\" and \\"Voyager.\\"  It was the first \\"Star Trek\\" series to be produced and broadcast in high-definition video, but lasted only four seasons.<br /><br />Though some episodes recapture the magic of earlier series, there are a number of drawn-out, talky shows that are better geared for radio than television, since they lack strong visuals.  Perhaps this has to do with a limited budget, but it's sad to see such a glorious, highly popular franchise diminished by pedestrian writing and lackluster acting.<br /><br />Bonus features on the six-disc Blu-ray release include a new three-part documentary containing new cast and crew interviews and vintage behind-the-scenes footage; cast and crew commentaries on select episodes; and \\"In Conversation,\\" a candid interview with creators Rick Berman and Branon Braga.
B009GED3HS|5.0|This show is absolutely amazing.  Whether it is your first time watching, or you have seen it 10 times, the humor never quits!!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Wonderful in every way--dynamic storyline with great acting and great concept.  When one gets to the last Season, one is asked to pay $1.99 an episode.  I'm happy I watched so many seasons, and by the time the last season(s) are included free in Amazon Prime, I will have forgotten most of it so I will have the pleasure of watching it all again.
B00013RC8O|5.0|I was so jazzed to finally get a dvd of Vanishing Point.  I too saw this movie when it was released to the theaters and I just loved it.  Frankly I am not much of a 'car flick\\" gal but I love Barry Newman's acting and all the supporting actors.  Still a very enjoyable movie.
B008602KQI|5.0|Saw this at the theater.  Was glad that I had read the book first.  Watched it again thru Amazon streaming on Toshiba tablet - video and audio very good.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|If you're looking for science fiction this book is not for you.  Vonnegut displays war's disrepair and futility softened by time travel to \\"Tralfamador\\" and by resignation to death with \\"So it goes.\\"  It's a thoughtful read.
B000O9RFDW|5.0|I owned this album back in the 1970s and really enjoyed it.  Now that I started playing vinyl again, I wanted to hear it once again.  Albums sound so much better than their digital cousins.
1617751588|4.0|This is the third book in the Simon's cat print series. There is no real continuity issue across the series, and the characters are just stand-ins for characters you might know. Overall there is little substance or depth, but that's not what this is all about, it's about making you smile, as you can relate to the actions of the cat (and now kitten). And at this, as a cat person, it is likely to excel.<br /><br />What makes this book interesting was that whilst the first two were about the cat exploring the home and then the backyard / beyond the fence, this book has the added layer of being about sibling rivalry and kids being mischievous to each other or their parent. So the new character, which unlike book two's hedgehog and birds, has a much clearer defined role and makes it easier to relate to.<br /><br />As per usual Tofield's drawings are gorgeous, and it is easy to relate to the situations. Also featured are the dog, the hedgehogs and birds make a return and (my favorite) the turtle. The reason I'm dropping a point is this: there are stickers that come with the book, but the page is bound into the middle of the book, so you can't really remove them, without having a blank page or a missing drawing. Its not a big deal because they are gorgeous and if they had not been bound in odds are you'd loose them :) .<br /><br />The other reason is there is a guide of how to draw the various characters and this is fantastic but he left out the turtle, and that's just an outrage!<br /><br />If you enjoy the videos and either of the previous books (or are a cat person), odds are you'll enjoy this one. I think title is distinctly better than the second, though maybe not quite as good as the first.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Be patient and this book will reward you. A worthwhile journey through time and space and thought. Read it. Go ahead :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|No issues... maintains my little girls interest. It is a really cute game. We both have a lot of fun with it.
1423140605|5.0|The book was in great condition when it arrived and the book itself was a great read. I highly recommend it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I almost put this book down without finishing...something I rarely do.  The plot seemed so transparent and the dialogue so sappy it was almost nauseating.  What an incredible twist!  I was completely sucked in by this author...ha ha ha ha...what a great 'gotcha' surprise!  Loved every minute of this book by the time it ended.....pure entertainment.
B00AB7HESI|2.0|I really want this app. I've been waiting for this and it won't install i wasted a dollar! It says there is an error installing and to try again.
B006X5L6VS|5.0|I live in a 'Dark Skies' community on the outskirts of a metropolis, in the AZ desert.  I marvel at the beautiful things I have missed most of my life...the bright and twinkling mysteries 'out there', the expanse of the Milky Way, shooting stars, the seasonal changes in the visible beauty.  In the Spring, about 1 am, a bright star beams in my window every night...Vega...I never knew her name until I found this app...Thanks!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I felt the second book was better than the first and I can't wait to finish the series! There wasn't a moment where I felt the story lost momentum.

B0042RJWTC|5.0|Seems to preserve history, beautiful costumes, great production.  Only criticism are the repeated previews that we have not been fast forwarding through.  Although good when not able to watch for several days.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SERIES.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|This is the 2nd part of a trilogy and tells the story of the families during this time period which are also described in the first part. Now the 2nd WW is starting and Kenn Follet shows the very different views from different parts of the world: The UK Russia, Germany, Berlin and the USA<br />The people are from different backgrounds and political views I loved to read this book<br />Especially the German part where you meet people who are against the Nazis<br />Strange that there was almost nothing on the concentration camps<br />I am looking forward to the third part of this trilogy

B00127RAJY|5.0|30 Day Shred is one of my go-to workouts for rainy or time-crunched days. Great workout for arms and legs; core is worked but not excessively. I really like her system of 3 minutes strength, 2 minutes cardio, 1 minute abs. The levels do get harder, but I take the freedom to move between levels as I want. I think 10 days straight of one level would be boring and a little ridiculous. I would definitely recommend this to anyone seeking a boost for their own workout routine.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|Well written, captivating book. It majorly distracted me from my day-off, to-do list. Kudos to another triumph in the Lincoln Lawyer series.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This was chosen as the book-of-the-month for my 12-person book club; 9 of us were able to meet and discuss it and it was a universal hit.  I had read other Kate Morton books and like her works a lot.
6304712936|5.0|Great movie - Academy Award winning - great story!  If you haven't seen it - check it out - it's a must!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It  does what its suppoeed to do. I cant think of anything more that could be offered by a battery app than what this app has. And I really appreciate its character. It feels refined. Like someone put a lot of time and effort into this. If you are looking for a gold battery app, look no further.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The speech patterns of the characters don't add up and make it obvious that this story, set in the Pacific Northwest, was written by a Britt and one that was just going for shock value. It should have been edited by an American living in America that would have picked up the odd turns of phrase. I found this really distracting. For example, the characters continually indicate that they need to \\"fetch\\" something. Only Britts \\"fetch\\", Americans \\"get\\". This would be pardoned if the characters in question were well traveled and spent much time in Great Brittain, but the author takes great pains to point out that the central female has never left the USA. One other problem is the gratuitous use of the \\"F Bomb\\". Again, the female central character is well educated, a literature major in college and not street smart. It is incongruous that this woman would regularly drop the F Bomb. Most of the characters are either well educated or highly successful professionals, so the every other sentence usage of the F Bomb is incongruous. Some of the common phrases in the book aren't common uses in the US (if anywhere) \\"Holy F\\" is just not what people say. The story line isn't bad, so If you're just looking for salacious junk reading and aren't bothered by details, go for it. However, if you're looking for characters that make sense, try another book. The author could have elevated the book by sending it to an American editor living in America that was paying attention to the speech patterns of the characters. It could have been a much better book.

B00AQB2A3I|5.0|Steven Wilson never disappoints.  Ever innovative, creative, and the most prolific song writer in the world today!  The level of musicianship is stunning and so incredibly rare anymore.  You don't have to love progressive rock to love this album - You just have to love great music.
B006QQ77F8|3.0|This movie was probably quite progressive for its time but feels very dated now.  The acting is good and Kubrick is a genius (though this is worst film IMHO).  The screenplay is so tame, compared to the novel, that it doesn't really make the points the novel does.  The societal conventions when this movie was made give us a 14 year old Lolita played by an allegedly 16 year old actress (who looks 20), which totally changes the story and its impact.
B00914JWSW|5.0|How can anything Barbra does not be worth the price of the CD.  Love love it<br />And if you love BS, you will want it.
B0034G4P26|5.0|My 3 year old loves fish, and makes us replay the ending over and over again.  He loves claymation styled movies like Chicken Run.  Pirates was a hit in our home!
B0012FHGCW|1.0|If you look around on the web, you'll see that this guy was pretty useless to begin with and wasted all his opportunities, ending up dying. This movie glamorizes both Alaska and this jerk's life. He had a fishing pole, he had a map, he poached moose and let it rot. He went completely unprepared into this situation and even then had the tools to get himself fed and get out of the situation. This movie, because it's meant to portray reality is utter crap. There was nothing glamorous about this idiot and nothing noble about being useless and unprepared, then going off and dying of starvation in the wilderness because you're stupid.
B005DJGMQE|5.0|The film was very authentic, I enjoyed the story! Good actors and great costumes. It was a story line that I had not heard.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The new updated version I use is amazing. No flaws I love it. Please buy app in the store . I recommend it to you.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|The cap that comes with the Nikon 18 - 55 mm Kit lens is not adequate. This is an excellent replacement and should have been included with the lens as purchased.
B000FA675C|5.0|Intrigue is always interesting and Brown weaves very well. Every book I have read that he has written has kept me page turning, and yearning to get back to it when not reading. The Da Vinci Code rates right up there with the best.
B007XAYKX8|5.0|Fastest is one of the best racing documentaries period. The action shots are up close and technical. The interviews are short, concise and compelling. Do not miss it. It should be on your short list of racing documentaries.
1449325947|4.0|I am a person that learns by reading and then doing, the Missing Manual Series of books are always the first ones I go to when wanting to learn more indepth about a topic for design and web.  My instructor used them in school to teach us and learn themselves, so I continued seeking them out for growth in my career.<br /><br />I love the great examples given in the book for what is supported in the different browsers, what is deprecated, and whats better on different devices and screens.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|I really enjoyed this film.  Basically, every character in this based-on-real-events screenplay is a criminal in the setting of moonshining country during the Depression.  In other words, as a viewer, we are compelled to pull for whichever is the most honorable among them:  the moonshiners, the corrupt police, or those in organized crime who play both sides against the middle.  The action, the relationships, and the overall conflict are all wonderfully written, directed, and acted.
B00003CXIP|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! Everything about it is just amazing. First of all, let's start off by how great the cast is and how well they portray their characters. River Phoenix (may he RIP) is absolutely phenomenal as Chris and his performance made an impact on me that I don't even understand. It is a classic coming-of-age story about 4 small town boys on the verge of their teen years and all the confusion and mayhem we all feel at that time. It wasn't so long ago that I was the same age as these kids and this movie just brought out everything I loved and cherished about my childhood, even though I never went on a search for a dead body. It just made me think back and really appreciate being a kid and also made me wish I could go back! I recommend this movie to everyone! It was made back in 1986, which is before my time, but that's the beauty of it. Anyone can watch it and still enjoy it because of that timeless factor that it possesses. However, I can't help but be sad about River Phoenix when I watch this because of how much his life resembled that of Chris Chambers. Anywhoooo, great movie! 5 STARS!
B00BGZ8OLA|3.0|While the gorgeous cinematography of this movie alone makes it worth seeing, I wasn't impressed with it overall.  A man retells the events that he experienced as a boy during and after a shipwreck with zoo animals and his family.  The promise is made early on that this is a story that will &#34;make you believe in God.&#34;  If this, indeed, is the purpose of the film, it failed miserably.  On that front, it was confusing at best.  I think it would be much more accurate to say, &#34;This is a story that explains how some people view religion and ecumenicalism.&#34;  On the positive side, it does make the viewer think long after the show's over, but by the time I was done thinking, my analysis was that I didn't agree with the author.  Eh, it was probably worth seeing, but it's definitely not going to make my top 100 list.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|will keep you entertained for hours. addicting. very cute. great for really any age. wish some new levels would come out though
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I loved Argo.  As someone who lived during the time of the events depicted in the film, I can testify that the feeling of the film -- the costumes, the film quality, the dialogue of the characters -- completely immersed me in the late '70's.  It was an incredibly tense time for Americans in the Middle East, and the thought that anyone would actually go into that setting to save others is mind-blowing.  To see how he did it is amazing.  I went into this movie knowing the outcome, but that didn't diminish the intensity at all.  In fact, in order to be able to stand the tension, there were times I had to chant to myself, &#34;They're going to make it out alright.  They're going to make it out alright.&#34;  That being the case, however, I still couldn't imagine HOW they were going to make it out alright.  Absolutely awesome!
B004LROUNG|5.0|The characters were so human and the story kept me captured.  One of John's best reads.  I have recommended to my friends.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|To one who's expecting an action adventure, this film would surely be a disappointment.  To anyone who enjoys history or politics, though, it's an wonderful movie, well worth watching.  Like many movies, I felt this one started off a bit slow, but once I got all the characters sorted out and exactly what the Thirteenth Amendment was all about, it became very interesting.  The actors and the directing were all excellent, and the writing seemed very historically-accurate, also.  For example, I've always read that Lincoln's voice was rather high and thin, but this is the first movie I've seen where Lincoln wasn't played by a baritone.  Daniel Day Lewis was highly convincing, as was Sally Field as his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln.  It was also good to see Abraham Lincoln portrayed as a real, live, quirky human being -- one whom I might believe to be a bit off-putting to his political peers.  Too often his historical importance causes writers and directors to view him as a superhuman who is so obviously correct that it would make no sense for anyone to disagree with him.  In fact, I believe the gritty, contradictory personalities and opinions of all the characters and my wondering how they could possibly be persuaded to change their minds is what created the interest of the movie.  I really enjoyed it, and I felt smarter for watching it.
B004WKOCP8|5.0|Short and sweet, Incubus is all about constant evolution and their unapologetic shifts in style are what keep them relavant and interesting in my eyes. As most new records from a highly anticipated album, I was a little thrown off by my expectation of what I thought the record would be VS what it is... It grew on me exponentially and it's one of my favorite Incubus records. Buy it!
B00BGICGJ8|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. It was funny and in some parts inappropriate but I still enjoyed it. Can't go wrong.
B003U53GK8|5.0|A active drama that's very exciting right to the very end. A story you couldn't figure out until the very last episode.
B000002J6H|5.0|\\"To a Flame\\" alone makes this album sparkle and shine with unending beauty. Both David Crosby and Graham Nash released solo albums after the rock breakthrough, \\"Crosby, Stills & Nash\\". All 3 had Gold solo albums, but, Stills also went Top 3 while his partners peaked at Top 15.<br /><br />Stills had the radio smash, \\"Love the One You're With\\" that had immediate entry into the American rock songbook with a wide range of artists from Aretha to The Isley Bros. to the post-Diana Supremes and The Four Tops, as the \\"Magnificent Seven\\" releasing versions within months of the original. That gave his solo debut velocity.<br /><br />But don't miss \\"Old Times, Good Times\\" and \\"Go Back Home\\" with Hendrix making a guest appearance!<br /><br />This was definitely a rites of passage album for me. \\"To a Flame\\" soaked deeply into my soul and could bring me to tears. As I was entering college when it came out, Stephen rose above the other members of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young with this album. Once Neil joined the group, he got the bulk of the critical praise. Neil was great, but, Stephen truly trumped the deck with this debut.<br /><br />I must go put it on right now.

006224454X|4.0|I have been wanting to read this book for quite some time.  I'm not sure why I finally picked it up, but I'm really glad that I did and VERY surprised to learn that this is the author's first novel.  There's a lot of talent here!  I can't wait to see more.  Anyhow, about the book:<br /><br />The story starts off very slowly and I remember thinking \\"I hope this gets better, I hope the whole thing isn't like this!\\"  But it picked up fairly quickly.  The story goes from her daily life, which basically starts over again everyday.  The main character had a horrible experience that has left her with memory loss.  She can remember only the day she currently lives in and forgets everything while she sleeps.  Therefore, no matter how often she is reminded of something, the next day it is gone.  She wakes up: where am I, who am I, who is this man...etc.  She gets a phone call and is reminded by a doctor that she has been writing in a journal and that's when the novel really starts to draw you in.  The act of writing allows the main character to remember things.  Slowly, memories are triggered, from childhood, to adulthood, to the horrible night that this happened, but we never really know HOW this happened.  Then everything gets really intense.  She asks her husband certain questions, and he is lying.  Or she THINKS he is, because she wrote down one thing, and he says another. She is attempting to figure it out all before the moment she has to close her eyes and fall asleep.<br /><br />The way the author rolled out the story was really well done.  It was a bit repetitive, as others have mentioned, and it does start to annoy you as you're reading.  But I think it really adds to the story in this particular case because she has to be reminded who she is every morning.  It must have been taxing to write it that way, but I can respect the author's devotion to keep the story believable.  My only gripe is that the end was really short and fast.  It was just kind of ...this is what happened! THE END.  I found myself wanting just a little more...just a BIT MORE!  But overall, I loved the book a lot and the ending was GREAT.  While you spend the entire book thinking, is it this? is it that? FINALLY you get to the end and BAM! It's good, and worth all the repetitive reading.happened! THE END.  I found myself wanting just a little more...just a BIT MORE!  But overall, I loved the book a lot and the ending was GREAT.  While you spend the entire book thinking, is it this? is it that?

B00BAYLQI0|1.0|Hokey, and way too sappy, Hollywood reimagining of the 2004 tsunami that washed away and killed over 230,000 people, including washing away this one insufferable family on vacation in Thailand. The opening 15 minutes of \\"character development\\" for this bland family offers no character development whatsoever except one kid is mean to his brother and Mom and Pop are concerned about money, so it's off to a pretty lame start right from the get-go.<br /><br />Then the wave hits and it looks pretty much just like high tide at Zuma Beach, although you do see one whole car being washed away. Wow! Even though the resort the family is at is full of people, once the wave hits, the only two people who we see and who can stay afloat (separately, I must add) are Naomi and one of her kids. They yell to each other from afar as the second wave rolls in, and finally manage to swim into each others' arms in Hollywood schmaltz at its finest. How touching! The music swells to high heaven, of course. A couple of bloody marks on them, that's it, whereas the strength of a real tsunami would have ripped them to shreds. Yes, I know this is based on a true story, but there is nothing the least bit realistic about the way any of the drama or action taking place in this film is depicted. Seriously, for a disaster that killed thousands and thousands of people in the blink of an eye, Naomi and her kid ride out the waves as if it's family day at Raging Waters. From then on, it's just one unconvincing development and cliche after another as these survivors spend 90 grueling (for the audience) minutes meeting native survivors and other annoying characters, all filmed with super-annoying shaky cam and with over-stylized editing. Why do we care about these people? Well, we don't, not at all. So let's now cut away 1-hour in to tell Ewan's story instead. That will keep the viewers watching!<br /><br />Even the tsunami's aftermath is laughable. As soon as they drive a little bit inland, there's no devastation, just random injured people sitting or laying at the side of the road. Has the director never seen any photographic documents of the devastation that this tsunami actually left behind?!?!?! If not, maybe he could at least look at some of the many youtube clips of the tsunami that happened in Japan to see how much wreckage and devastation a tsunami wreaks. Any of those real-footage clips is a million times more powerful than any one second of this sappy, Lifetime movie junk.<br /><br />THE IMPOSSIBLE is akin to watching a mom and kid fall off a slide at Raging Waters. They get bruised up a little bit, and then we have to watch Mom and kid's trek to their car in the Raging Waters parking lot, and then Dad tries to get off work and treks over to meet them there. Will Naomi reunite with Ewan, and will their insufferable kids be nice to each other from now on? If you care about either part of that question, this movie is for YOU. Otherwise, steer clear of this excruciatingly banal insult to the memory of anyone who has died, or even survived, such a horrible disaster. The scene where the three kids reunite and the overly emotional music swells, I almost vomited in my mouth. Cliched, poorly directed and edited, terrible script, unconvincing effects, sappy score. Oh ya, I almost forgot, you get to see an even longer depiction of the tsunami near the end of the film as Naomi dreams about it; wherein a CGI Naomi does 'battle' with branches and other underwater debris! Just like in a cool videogame! Hey, it's a little more convincing than the kiddie wave shown at the start of the film, so I'll give it that, at least.<br /><br />Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor are always terrific, and they are both terrific here, but even they can't save this junk. One of the year's worst.
0439023513|1.0|I won't give out any spoilers, but this book was such a disappointment. The first of the series was amazing, the second was good, but this one really sent The Hunger Games series into a downward spiral. I don't think I cried this much since all of the deaths in Harry Potter! Just read the first book and assume they all live happily ever after.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This show is great... I cant wait for the next season to be available to watch for prime members..As of now I have watched all of the seasons prime has to offer at no cost.. I cant wait to see what happens next, the story is building and becoming very suspenseful, i cant give anymore details than that without ruining the show for new viewers.. DEFINITELY A MUST SEE!!!! Highly recommend..
0345803507|5.0|The third time is a charm and in E.L. James trilogy, Fifty Shades Freed comes full circle as Anastasia and Mr. Grey finally make it official as husband and wife.  Seems like the two are moving toward happily ever after but yet again destiny has other plans. James' books never are what they seem and they are filled with twist and turns.  Can you truly find your soul mate that fulfills all your naughty desires or should be happy with the one you are with?<br />Anastasia tries to find her way to the wife of a very wealthy and successful man in Mr. Grey, but she discovers that having everything that money can buy can bring its own challenges. How does she keep the sex nice and hot, while not being held back by life's realities?  Finish off the series and read the book.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|very much like Creed Green Irish Tweed,  but a tad bit more neutral and dry.  good for everyday wear.  recommended.
B004EPYZXK|3.0|I had very mixt feelings when I finished watching this film. I rate it three stars (which means \\"It is OK\\"), because it was not bad enough for me to hate it - but also certainly not good enough to be liked. Below, some more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.<br /><br />As we learn at the very beginning of the film, this is the story of the \\"Apollo 18\\" lunar mission - which officially never took place. It seems however, that some conspiracy theory passionates found \\"lost footage\\" filmed during this mission - the film is supposed to be a kind of \\"you tube\\" viewing of those miraculously recovered tapes...<br /><br />Three astronauts were send to the Moon in \\"Apollo 18\\", which officially was an unmanned probe - it was necessary to invent this cover story to deceive the public, as it is a little bit hard to conceal the take-off of a Saturn V giant rocket from Cape Canaveral... Commander Nathan Walker and Captain Ben Walker were supposed to land on the Moon and deploy some special electronic captors for the Department of Defense (the official reason why this mission is so secret) - Lieutenant-Colonel John Grey was supposed to stay in the orbiter and wait for the return (the same procedure as in real lunar manned mission).<br /><br />Well, as you can see on the cover, at least one of them will land on Moon and he will have a great number of reasons to regret it... No more spoilers here.<br /><br />Now, visually this film is a very good thing - the \\"lost footage\\" seems really like something that could really have been taken during a genuine lunar mission. Spaceships interiors and lunar landscape were well done, no argument there. Actors were unknown to me, but they did a good job. Sound editing was particularly well done and acoustics play an important role in this film - freaky interferences which plague radio communications during most of the film were really well thought and conceived.<br /><br />However, I must say that I didn't care for most of the scenario. Some limited SPOILERS here. Really, people, would it really hurt that in at least one SF film people who are send on a mission are actually briefed about the REAL reasons for their mission? Virtually everything that happens past the first 30 minutes is such a \\"clich&eacute;\\", that we can anticipate EVERY single development until the final credits... It is amazing, how one can combine a rather original initial idea (a secret lunar mission) with every and each one of the un-original, stereotyped, saw-it-all-one-thousand-times-before, yawn+fastforward tricks.<br /><br />Some reviewers didn't like the general scientific idea behind the scenario, but I for one rather appreciated it. Possible HUGE SPOILER ahead: if you are concerned about the scientific realism of this film, please go on the internet and look up the very real living creatures called \\"tardigrades\\", most complex of all currently known polyextremophiles... But if you didn't see this film yet, you may want to postpone this research for after the viewing. However, once again, the excellent initial idea of hasards lurking on the Moon was wasted by the following accumulation of all possible and imaginable \\"clich&eacute;s\\".<br /><br />So bottom line, I personally found this film OK, but somehow disappointing. But one can not deny it some originality in the general ideas and the visual and acoustic aspects are pretty well done indeed. Therefore, if you are into SF and/or horrors, you are encouraged to see it and make up your own mind. Otherwise do not bother. In any case I will not keep this DVD for any future viewings..

B00BVVA138|5.0|So...I'm not a pure KS fan in the sense that I haven't been following their work that closely. I'm 53 and not that testosterone/angry so don't head bang a lot...I had a couple of their earlier albums on my playlist for a while but they didn't stick for long.<br />All that said, this one - after just a few spins - sounds epic.<br />Ultimate aggression backed up by super melodic tracks and awesome vocals.<br />This is one frickin great band.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I can't stop watching . Since I don't have cable of dish this is a great way to catch up on the show.
B0091WUZJE|2.0|Perhaps many John Wayne old movies are like this.  I'm not sure as I haven't seen one in a long time.  It was so bad it was actually funny.  For starters the movie takes place in &#34;Texas&#34; but is actually Monument Valley.  The scenery is good the acting is bad.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|I would recommend this book to any one that has read the other sword of truth series or has seen the tv show Legend of the Seeker. I love this series
B005K17RU0|5.0|Easy to use and very informative.  Gives me everything I need to know weather wise in just a few minutes.
0385512104|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  I have a high-functioning autistic grandson and was glad to get a view of the world through his eyes.  This is a haunting portrayal of real life, with real people.  They are not ideal, they are not the best we could hope for, they are what we have.  So the reading is sometimes disturbing - but not terribly so because the author knows how to dose the necessary out in small doses leading to something lighter than relieves the tension.<br /><br />This is well-written.  It is a must-read for anyone curious about the mental workings of people on the autism spectrum and is a must-read for anyone with such a person in their lives.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|We love this game & have made friends playing this constantly. It is so much fun even if you can't draw well. You get better & earn points to &#34;buy&#34;more colors etc. It really is one of our favorite games! Recommend it to everyone!

B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Great<br />This CD will definitely take you back in time to the 80s.  Great music, and the motion picture cast did a great job too.  Watch the movie too.  Baby Boomers will enjoy this walk down memory lane.  A very good variety of musical hits.  I ordered three more as gifts!
B006LSZECO|1.0|This review is to stop people who might be like me from buying Gone Girl.  I like books where I can identify with at least one of the characters and at least one of them has a redeeming quality.  This book has no characters like this.  They are bad people and made me sick.  I don't use the word hate often, but here goes... I hated the plot, I hated the characters, and I hated the ending.  I was actually angry when I finished reading it.  What bothers me most is that there are a whole slew of people out there that liked this book.  I still wonder what kind of sick twisted mind could come up with something like this.  My apologies to the author for being so candid, but I really found it to be extremely unsettling and wish that I had never read it.
B0067R0APK|1.0|I paid for and downloaded this app over a year ago.  Last night I went to use it and I got an error saying I was not entitled to the content.  I guess they want you to pay again and again.  Don't buy it.

B00742GBDM|3.0|This movie is ok, it does have some big differences from the book but the people who made the movie probably felt the changes/additions were necessary.
B004WO8B60|2.0|This is the movie that inspired Quarantine which I have to say is the way better version of this film. Normally the original is better but I don't think it is in this case. Basically if you've seen Quarantine then you've seen this but this is just a spanish version pretty much. It's not horrible but not nearly as good. Check it out only if your curious to see where Quarantine came from.
0811876373|5.0|I love Bakerella and her cake pop creativity! She is so cute and this book is great! It has lots of pictures, instructions and ideas for many occasions or just for fun! Enjoy!
B00BSBY38A|3.0|It wasa pretty entertaining movie to say the least. Would I buy it? Probably not but it is worth a watch. The HD quality was pretty poor I think so I would recommend renting this on blu-ray or something if you want to get the most out of your viewing experience. Has a very awesome boat sinking scene though. Didn't really care for the ending that much but that's just me. Visuals were also really well done.

B00BRUYQFC|3.0|The album to me is average, there was more hype than worthwhile content. Suit and tie is the best song, a tune that was always in play on the radio. Smh
B000BMSTMS|5.0|Swearing. Dark lyrics. KoRn. 5 stars doesn't do it justice for this awesome album of theirs! Perfect condition and perfect quality. Arrived a day early, which was awesome. Amazon never done me wrong yet, so I continue to do business with them. :)
1469220474|1.0|This book was not that great.  In fact, I really didn't like it.  It was unimaginative and dull and it felt like the author, Sylvia Day, said \\"I can do a better version of Fifty Shades of Grey\\".  Both books had an extremely handsome, billionaire main male character, under 30 with serious issues.  And in each book, they pursued a young woman who eventually falls for him.  Neurotic, possessive and controlling are serious character flaws.  Not something to be cherished.  Sex?  Yep, it's in there!<br /><br />While \\"Fifty\\" introduced the BDSM lifestyle, \\"Bared\\" seemed to throw in a word or two to say, see, we've got that too! I guess if you use the word \\"topping\\", then you're into BDSM too.  I purchased the book and audio CD.  Eva spoke as if she were a 40 year old woman, not a recent college grad.  I may be quite removed from my college years, but I work at a university and most of the young ladies I talked to (and overheard their conversations) didn't speak like that.  That's the main thing that made this book so painful.  If Eva is so mature to recognize the failings of Gideon and even herself, why would she behave the way she does?  Twice I had to put the book down and walk away from it.  It didn't make sense.<br /><br />There seems to be no significant timeline to gauge how much time has passed.  It reads like: \\"I met a guy, told him to get lost, now I'm in love.  OMG, he's got serious problems!  Hey, I've got serious problems too!  Most people would recognize immediately that this can't possibly work, but I'm in love and will love Gideon forever and everything will be fantastic.  It doesn't matter that behaviors still exist, our love will power through\\". Seriously????<br /><br />I guess what's aggravating about the book is that I was optimistic and had high expectations.  I wanted a book that was steamy but could tell a decent story with decent characters.  If I read about another billionaire, I'll pull my hair out.  What's wrong with a millionaire?  I bought thisbook (and audio) for the treadmill thinking I could enjoy a few steamy scenes while burning off the winter calories.  All I did was get ticked off.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book.  Read something funny like Wallbanger instead.
B004WR125O|4.0|I wanted an inexpensive wireless network connect stereo receiver.  This plus the Onkyo TX-8050 Network Stereo Receiver fit the bill.  This works great in a closet, in a bathroom, on the opposite side of the house from the wireless router.
B001CDD84Y|5.0|I like Jumper for its entertainment value primarily.  I also like it because<br />I firmly believe one day we humans will be able to use our minds more than we do our hands to move objects, communicate without electronic devices, and other cool stuff, and Jumper give us a glimpse into our future or at least what may be possible provided the government does not try us future Jumpers from doing our thing.
B001TM14VC|3.0|I've seen better, more full movies, but this one is just plain enjoyable to see.<br />The love story was a tad sappy.<br />The action sequences were kidna pro-forma<br />Inter-character interaction was good.<br />Hi-Def does not really help this movie.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Although I did not expect to actually care about the meanings of different flowers, I DO NOW!  Thank you to this author for finding a way to educate readers on this subject, in addition to telling a tale of foster children and forgiveness.  The writing is fantastic and I especially liked the way the story alternated between two time periods in the main character's life.  I will definitely think twice (and check my flower dictionary in the back of the novel) before purchasing flowers.<br /><br />Wendy Curtis<br />Author of The Seasons of Winter
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book grabbed me from the very beginning. I couldn't put it down.. I love that it went back and forth in time...I really got a sense of the characters as children and as adults. Gillian Flynn has this ability to capture intense emotion from the reader. This is the se book of hers I have read, and I intend to read them all.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|It was a great movie, with a great story. My kids, my husband and myself all laughed through out the whole movie.

B00BJS7LHC|4.0|A bit brutal but that's his style. Very entertaining but a bit corny in the end.<br />I see why Christof Waltz got best supporting actor. Well done.
0811879542|5.0|Instant obession with this book at our house. I feared our 20 month old was too young for it, but he is absolutely enthralled with following the directions and seeing the pictures change on the next page. Like most toddler boys, mine is obsessed with pushing buttons on electronics, and this gives him an outlet to push and shake away without any danger. Definitely recommend.
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|This dvd is by far the best Christmas dvd I own. It just brings out the festive holiday spirit. Beautiful music. Recommend to anyone who loves clasical holiday Christmas music
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Im not in love with this book.  The story is for younger people.  I thought it was a slow moving story.
B005LAII44|5.0|I have been a Joe fan since the very beginning--I have all the comics and most of the figures--and, though there are discrepancies with the Joes I know from the comic books (isn't there always with Hollywood?), these movies ROCK!!<br /><br />I don't want to say much about what happened in the movie, since a couple of reviews I read before seeing it spoiled a point or two for me but I will say it renewed my faith in Hollywood's ability to use at least SOME of the original plot points and character histories.<br /><br />I'll admit, I went to the first one to see just how bad they screwed up my all-time favorite (comic book) military unit only to discover myself hooked on the movie.<br /><br />I went to the sequel to see if all the bad reviews I'd read on Yahoo! movies page were right.<br /><br />THEY WEREN'T!!<br /><br />This is an action movie worthy of viewing even if you're not a Joe fan.  If you are, then definitely get it and be prepared to see more of the comic book storylines for the characters.  This movie endeared itself to me just like the first and, also like the first, has me hoping and anxious for a next chapter in the ongoing struggle between G.I. Joe and Cobra.<br /><br />Yo, Joe!

B009UX2YAC|4.0|Personally I really enjoy subway surfers. I think that it is really good and extremely addictive! I can't really fault it apart from a couple of minor things:<br />1) Sometimes it isn't very smooth to run and easy to turn<br />2) It takes up quite a lot of storage<br />3) It drains your battery<br />Apart from that, I love subway surfers
B0015DYIH2|1.0|Don't Waste Your Money, The Movie Was Definetly Better. The Ending Of This Book Drags On ForEver , And Is Anti-Climatic. Worst Ending I Have Ever Read In A Book, And I Have Read Some Turds. This One Takes The Toilet bowl.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|After watching the movie it was great to read the whole story. Both movies and books are different media- but you can't beat books to really capture the detail and feelings of how the characters, environment and circumstances are truly portrayed.<br />Sometimes you can be disappointed in comparing the two- but they are both well worth watching and reading.

B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|This book was really interesting! I might just have to give this a go! The benefits of this eating strategy make it worth a try.
B0011NVCSO|1.0|Love this album and figured for $11, might as well have it on Vinyl. Like other reviewers have said, this is an awful pressing- surface noise at times distorts the vocals.  Freaked out for a while thinking my $1100 dynavector 17d3 was damaged before seeing other reviews to the same effect. So sad as this album deserves a proper pressing.  Vinyl lovers beware.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|as long as you are ok with some cussing, this book is absolutely wonderful. I definitely cried happy tears. I also believe in silver linings.

B000FA675C|5.0|If you loved the movie, then you will love the book! While the movie was great, there were parts that couldn't be included due to time constraints. Growing up catholic made this book very interesting & enlightening
1439152802|3.0|I can't say I didn't like this book, but I certainly didn't love it.  It was hard to get into, but picked up speed in the second half.  A lot of the first half of the book was superfluous.  However, the second half of the book is it's redemption.  We're introduced to the character of Vivien, who's story is much more interesting.  She's also more likeable than Dorothy.  One of the things I did enjoy was trying to reconcile the 90-year old Dorothy with the Dorothy of flashbacks.  Though they seemed so different, Morton is able to weave everything together.  Her story really picks up pace in the second half of the book, and everything just clicks.  If this is your first Kate Morton book, don't judge the others by this one.  It's her weakest book, and even with that being said, it's still a good book with a fabulous, surprising, and believable ending!
B008602KQI|5.0|I don't find nothing fun in children that they have to die, but the movie was really really good , one of the kind that I would re watch more than once ! 5 stars
B002VPE1WK|3.0|Defintly it is what you pay for. If you can spend more, go for a Photographer brand. When I got backpack, at first I was amazed. Looked so great for me, lot of space, protection, etc... But then, I made a couple mistakes. They were my fault, but the backpack didn't help at all: first, I put it on the floor, wich was very wet but I didn't know, because it was really dark. It absorb the water like a sponge. Luck for me that my camera was at the top of the backpack and not the bottom, which got all wet. I had to get everything out and dry it as fast as I could. Second: I was running because I was about to lose a train, and the zipper opened by itself... And yes, the camera was the only thing that felt. The worst nightmare in life. It rolled all over the floor... Very fast. But nothing serious happened. I will take the lens to review just in case because the AF feels a little bit different. Such a luck for me. But for the bag, I am disappointed. Now I have to be so carefull with everything I do with it, something I wouldn't want to do all the time... So think about it.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Eleanor & Park was a novel of many stories.  The angst of teenagers, terrible family, loving family, doubting teenager, never fitting in teenager, first lov teenager...  You name it ..  But written with love for the main characters and told with stark reality.

B004T4KQJS|5.0|The way Krauss explains the universe is very relatable and understandable for laypeople.  If you're interested in Cosmology and the 'archetypal' questions of humanity, give this book a try.  As you read through the book you won't feel like you're trying to get through a long, drawn-out lecture.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is a sort of bizarre story, but kept me interested all the way.  Fun and poignant, bizarre, but realistic.  I loved it!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie is entertaining and original. It's based on a popular book which shares the same title as this movie. Lets just say I should add it to my personal collection... But I haven't done that yet because amazon provides it for me free with my Prime account!

B00AA0TZTW|5.0|I like this album just as much as the Jimi Hendrix Experience collection I think. I have heard other versions of the so called \\"inferior\\" tracks and they aren't any better. . . so that one guy was full of s***.    Damn this guy was an amazing artist.
B00BP4XDNQ|5.0|This movie is not for the faint, I was disgusted with how Jewish ppl were treated..that's all I will say...A MUST SEE!
B004X4QW42|5.0|This is not the usual Karate movie.  It has History and some things I never knew.  A friend loaned me a copy, and the guys in family really enjoyed it.  I got my brother a copy for his birthday, he really like it too.  It may or may not be as authentic as others have stated, but if you like this kind of thing, its a good movie.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|2nd time around for me. Now at a later age its even better. A must for all kids and adults!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|After watching the trailer I was very keen to watch what promised to be a very good movie. So I went through all the process of downloading the viewer software and entering my credit card details to buy the download. At the very last stage I get a message telling me I can't buy it for geographical reasons! I can't find any other reference to this movie not being available for download in Australia. What's going on? Could someone from Amazon please explain the problem and make sure that prospective purchasers of this, or any other restricted download, are told about the restrictions at the start of the purchase process, not the very end.<br /><br />PS  Have a nice day ;)
B000FC0P9E|4.0|The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is a short compared to other Stephen King books. I wasn't planning to read it but buying  an unopened pop-up version changed that. So I read a paperback. The title alone made me think it would be different from his other stories. I was wrong! Try i you'll like it&#34;
B0089LOKHG|5.0|This book although does have some slow parts will keep you on edge with the decisions that are made and the sacrifices that Lena must face to finally end her and everyone's suffering and regain their choice to love.

B009IEXKXI|4.0|Practical thinking, but it's difficult to describe the actual hardships that would be met. At least I know what to do now.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Thought book 1 was great and am in middle of book 2 now.  Hard to put the book/kindle down and find myself thinking about what is happening.  Can identify with Katniss's feelings.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great storytelling with rich characters. An addictive series from start to finish. Can hardly wait to see the next season.
0439023521|4.0|After seeing the movie first then reading the book I got a pretty good comparison, here's what I liked from both.<br /><br />The Book: I felt the desperation more while reading the book, I liked the voucher and how you can get your name entered more than once if you sign up for voucher's each month, I thought that should have been in the movie.  The mutations turned out to be a pretty big reveal, but were nay slightly mentioned in the movie. I also liked that that they kissed more than once in the book.<br /><br />The Movie: It nailed the casting, of each and every character.  I liked the beginning in the book a lot more than the movie.  I did love how they let the gamemaster be a character, that  really worked well, in the book he mentioned a couple of times.  The ending the movie really got right they cut out the fluff and kept the story moving, The book shows Cato being scared, I liked him in the movie more being an emotionless robot.<br /><br />I enjoyed both the book and the movie, bot and would recommend reading and watching both, there's enough differences that makes each enjoyable.
B003VWU2WA|2.0|I bought one for use as a volume knob for a Win7 media center system.<br /><br />It works OK after a reboot, but the drivers (and/or the little system-tray app) will inevitably crash after a  while, making it unusable. I've been through this with four separate computers (Dell, Toshiba, Lenovo, and home-built).
B00AFEXRME|3.0|Previews indicated that this movie was action packed. In reality it is rather slow and boring. I would not recommend.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Purchased because the original was lost. Woks the way it should. Certainly would buy it again if the original was lost.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Fun to watch 2 robots fall in love. Bought it on Amazon. Loved the ending and the end credits. Watch ith your kids or by yourself You won't be sorry
B00BF11STU|2.0|All the characters in this one were bad across the board.  The Americans in the film were mostly lifeless, without personality, and always found a way to use curse words un-necassarily.<br /><br />The depictions of Muslims in the movie had some inaccuracies.  For example, many of the Pakistani's or Taliban characters seemed like long haired pretty boy actors they were trying to convert into some hard-core &#34;terrorists&#34;.  They ended up looking more like a band of thugs involved in the drug trade than religious zealots.  Nearly everyone of them smoked cigarettes for example, whereas a Muslim extremist would be very unlikely to smoke cigarettes, especially from regions such as Afghanistan and Pakistan.<br /><br />Still, at the end of the day it was somewhat informative.  It showed what may have went on in the background of the search for Bin Laden, and some of what may go on within the CIA.  The scenes that were taken abroad looked very real and are engaging to the viewer.<br /><br />Without getting to political on everyone, I will say it could have been worse.
B00003CX95|5.0|I buy a lot of classic movies and this is a great movie.<br />It's a long movie ( about 4 hours long)but worth watching. I kept seeing ads on cable so I bought it on Amazon. True story abour William Wallace.<br />His family was killed and he wanted vengence (can't blame him), but a very sad ending.<br />I wanted to see in in it's entirty with out any intrupptions.<br />He got all the Clans together to fight the English king. after a Soldier raped his wife then the lord of his land had her tied to a stake and killed her.<br />One funny part was when the King got Irish to fight for him, but when the king told them to fight they ran up to the Scottish soldiers and joined forces with them, all hugging and laughing together, then I think they mooned the KIng. You will have to aee it.
B00BESKTMG|3.0|I've been a fan of Rza since probably 98' when I was around 16 years old.  He's a hero, a genius and a true ambassador in the realm of hip-hop culture.  He actually did the score to the movie Ghost Dog years back, and that was a very cool movie with a tantalizing, thought stimulating sound.<br /><br />The problem is I'm not really a big Kung Fu fan, but I had to see this because of Rza.  The fight scenes were certainly overkill, with blood squirting out like fire hydrants.  The sexual content was also overdone and distracting, unless your the type of person that enjoys porn.<br /><br />I did like the Rza's character though.  Kind of a subdued, outsider with a good heart.  I thought it fit him well.  The back story was slightly corny, but it was very ill seeing him ultimately get taken in and trained by Buddhist monks.  Me not being a fan of Kung Fu action, that part of the story line was the highlight of the movie for me.

B00BHMETKC|1.0|Definitely not the movie I was expecting to see.  I actually thought this movie was going to offer exposure to people who were ignorant to Iran, but instead it only confirmed and reinforced any prejudices one might have about the country and it's people.  There were many scenes of Iran in the movie (actually shot in Turkey) and in almost every scene the Iranians are depicted as one giant mob of frowning, belligerent, lifeless-zombies.  Their mouths are literally drooping over as they crowd the streets in search of flags to burn and people to hang.  It's like night of the living dead.<br /><br />Along with that there are more subtle, totally unnecessary depictions of Iranians.  For example, the rule is, if you are an Iranian and you are in a rush and running somewhere, you must find a random woman to shove to the ground on the way to get where you are going.<br /><br />But all is good in the end, when the heroic Americans escape and are informed on the plane that they can now begin drinking their booz again.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I think that subway surfers copied off of temple run 2. In temple run 2 they have dimonds that save your life. In subway surfers they use keys but still the same concept. I like it but, u guts copied.

0812993845|2.0|Sophie Kinsella is an insta-buy for me and I was eagerly awaiting this book's release.  Little did I know that anticipation was going to be the best part of the book, to me this was just too long with too many characters I cared nothing about.  Lottie and her sister Fliss weren't the most endearing characters and I didn't really like Lottie's random scatterbrained antics like I have in past novels.  Most of the male leads in the novel were just so-so for me and at 500 pages I had to force myself to keep reading.  I would wait until this one is on sale before purchasing.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Argo was certainly entertaining, but this appears more substantive.  The early scenes on waterboarding could have been eliminated without significant loss--and might have made this picture more politically correct.  Nonetheless, this is a very interesting story of determination and ultimate success.  The dialog seems authentic and the plot moves along nicely.
0802473156|3.0|Great book. Husband has started reading it. We have done the love language profiles and so far so good. Strongly recommend.
B000002O4X|5.0|I listen in the car - what a relief from the humdrum radio music.  I have lots to visualize while I'm listening.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good to know the ending to this series.  Keeps you wondering if anything like this could ever take place. Would stronly recommend the series
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Amazing the controversy a book like this stirs up - with friends saying it is not true because it isn't biblical.  This is this man's experience - it was true for him - and it turned him into a believer.  What more do these people want?
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this third book in the series.  One can't help having sympathy for Lisbeth. After the second book, I couldn't wait to find out what happened to her.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I think this is my favorite season so far - with season 5 as a close second - and I love watching it over and over again.  The gag reel is not to be missed!
B0087HT36U|4.0|There are occaisions when the graphics show no support under the bad guys but they remain as if there is something they're standing on. That said, the game is a fun casual game. The strategy has to do with finding key stone and other fortification weaknesses that will bring structures down with only the weapons provided. The sounds are not as clever as Angry Birds, but it makes a nice change of pace from that game.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|This show just keeps raising the stakes and keeps me wanting more.  Part of it is the magnetic cast, but the writing is what really punches it up to must see TV.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|The quality of the editing is apalling.<br />As the books go on (which are too small by the way and broken at rediculous places) there are more and more errors with grammer.<br />There are sentences that do not make sense or are missing words.<br /><br />I suspect that the books have been broken up in smaller sizes just so that we can be ripped off by having to pay more to get to the end.<br /><br />For some of us, even though the story is average, we still need to know then ending.<br /><br />Disappointed at the quality and quantity in all books.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This book is not nearly as good as the first two books. Since I read the others I felt obligated to read the last one mainly because I wanted to know how it all ended. I felt like this book had a great deal of slow parts and I felt like I had to force myself to finish it. I also still have some unanswered questions: what happened to Ana's ex-boss (never mentioned if he had to serve time or not or if he got off)? What happened with the plan for ruining Linc's life? How we're Linc & Ana's ex-boss connected? Way too many unanswered questions left for me.
B0044WZN9I|1.0|Someone had told us this was good a long time ago, so we finally got around to watching it. It is one of those movies you would see at 3 a.m. on cable. B-list everything.
B009FZFONO|2.0|I was really intrigued by the show at first. I felt like There would be great adventures as we watched the characters grow and change as they survived, and most importantly, I felt I would learn about the zombie apocalypse. Unfortunately, very little of this happen. Other than Rick spacing out a bit, he remained his old self righteous self, and Andrea continued to saunter along like she was have zombie to begin with. I hope the walking dead returns with more answers, a more changing plot, a faster paced story,  but most of all characters growing and changing.
B00127RAJY|5.0|When I first started doing this, I was sweating like crazy and could barely breath! It definitely kicked my butt. As it got warmer, I started to walk/run outdoors, hike, rock climb and really upped my fitness level. I decided to use this again one day when I wanted a quick workout. It was so easy! I was still sore the next day, but I remember thinking back several months how I would pray for the 20 minutes to end. I couldn't have gotten in shape to begin with without this video. You can do anything for 30 days, and it is only 20 minutes! And she reminds you - no breaks, if you want to get in shape with a 20 minute workout, every minute has to count.
B000FA675C|2.0|Taken as fiction, this is a solid page-turning thriller. To write the ultimate &#34;conspiracy theory&#34; novel—questioning the foundation of Christianity and Western Civilization—is one thing. But for Dan Brown to pretend his work is based on anything remotely resembling &#34;facts&#34; is craven self-promotion.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I've only watched the first 3 or 4 shows in Season 1 but I find it refreshing and endearing. There is a lot of love between the characters and I am looking forward to watching many more episodes.
B000FA675C|4.0|While the book won't go down as a masteripiece in literature, The Da Vinci Code exploits the reader's curiosity and love for a good mystery and turns it into a product that you will definitely enjoy and that will fuel your imagination as well as your thirst for more.
B000001EG6|4.0|This is a very good, but not great Elton John album.  Has some great tunes (Your Song, I Need You To Turn To) but some clunkers too (The Cage).  Here is a song by song rating.  Recommended.<br /><br /> 1. Your Song - 10<br />  2. I Need You To Turn To - 10<br />  3. Take Me To The Pilot - 8<br />  4. No Shoe Strings On Louise - 8<br />  5.

B005QJZ5FA|4.0|Fun, Funky, and Sultry sound...Lana Del Rey is now one of my favorites!  Diet Mountain Dew can be really addictive...fabulous retro sound and look!  LOVE HER!
159562015X|5.0|I gotten the book in great condition and the access code untainted, thank you so much I couldn't be more thankful in a great price!
B0061Q13V2|5.0|There very few days that I can remember exactly where I was and how I felt when certain events happened like the space shuttle exploding on takeoff, attack on the World Trade Center, my father passing away, and US winning gold in Atlanta. Dominique holds a special place in my heart.
0061122416|5.0|Same book, great condition and material only problem it wasn't the exact paper frontal cover I expected. It's the latest edition and that's okay just wasn't expecting that.
B009LMTDL0|1.0|Nothing new in this book, more about her.<br /><br />Hard to read it's so dull......<br /><br />I certainly wouldn't want to work with or for Sheryl Sandberg and am aware of many other very smart, successful women who feel the same way.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|Much prefer this to the Oprah narration. Nothing against her, but I just don't like her narration. David Attenborough just seems to embody this sort of documentary, while Oprah sounded like she was in a studio, recording narration.
B000FA675C|5.0|I read this book a few years ago and loved it.  This book makes you stop and think what if?
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|A gripping story that, like all Jodi Picoult novels, forces you to analyze yourself and your innermost assumptions. Brava, Jodi!
0694003611|5.0|It's a classic for a reason! My son loves this book as well as My World. We read them every night before bed.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|i read a lot of fiction, probably 5 books per month.<br /><br />I thought this book was extraordinary!!  not only is Steve Jobs an amazing person but the way the bok was written keeps you engaged the whole way.  Congrats to all involved.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Self contained living systems in underground silos make for interesting setting. The whole conspiracy is also interesting. I'm not sure about the end. It seemed a bit abruptly cut. Given the philosophical paragraphs and attempts to hint on some deeper issues within the system I was quite disappointed with very short resolution and closing.
B008M7BQHE|5.0|This is such an awesome show. I am super addicted, cant stop watching it! Thanks JJ you are the man.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH AND CANNOT WAIT UNTIL THE THIRD SEASON IS RELEASED ON DVD  DO NOT REALLY HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY OR NEED TO SAY BUT THE HAVE A MINIMUM NUMBER OF WORDS REQUIRED FOR THE REVIEW
B007712XAU|5.0|I haven't viewed Season 1 yet but found Season 2 satisfactory. Both sets were packaged as new and arrived in good condition.

1118109791|4.0|If you are preparing for the GMAT, get this book. After studying for a couple months, I would say this book is probably not enough by itself, but it is the right foundation to start studying with. For me, I had been away from math for a few years, so I needed a refresher math book, and I went with the Cliff notes math test refresher book (which is also a great product). That book does a great job of bringing you up to speed on the math basics you need for the GMAT. This GMAC book continues where that book leaves off. Most importantly, this book uses a very similar language to describe math/verbal/awa/IR principles to the language used on the actual GMAT test. I think this is important to note. As said, this book provides a solid foundation for studying, but what it mostly lacks is enough studying questions. Don't get me wrong, it has hundreds of study questions, but if you want a decent score you will probably need to study two to three times the questions found in this book. Nevertheless, I would certainly recommend this book.
B004JQN4WM|5.0|Another great addition to the Papo collection. Very well painted, sculpted and detailed.I guess it's not anatomically perfect as some have mentioned, but the pose and overall quality make up for it. I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in dinosaurs for collecting, dioramas, whatever. If your shopping for a Ankylosaurus look no further.
B008JFUO0Y|4.0|I thought this was a pretty decent remake/sorta kinda sequel to the original classic. I didn't love it, but I don't hate it. The gore and special effects were great! The setting and atmosphere were very creepy, but it's not 'the most terrifying film you will ever experience' A group of friends are meeting up at a cabin to help Mia quit her drug problem, cold turkey. When Eric reads from the Necronomicon (in this film, it's called Naturom Demonto) all hell breaks loose, unleashing demons to possess the souls of the group. There were a few scenes that made me cringe. If you want a bloody gory creepy good time, you'll love EVIL DEAD!!!
B002VX3RCW|5.0|This quickly became my 4 month olds favorite toy, now 2 months later it still is.  Great textures and sounds.  I would recommend to anyone.
B0020MKTOS|5.0|study of a old man trying to adjust and in the process helps those he at first hates. Clint Eastwood at his best
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Although a fan of the fantasy genre, I felt that this was going to be derivative when I first heard of it.<br /><br />I. Was. Wrong.<br /><br />This show masters the art, with skillful complexity, of meshing emotion and action in an even mixture. An ever-brewing sense of urgency pervades the lives of all characters involved into a turmoil-tortured dramatic paradise.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|The graphics were really nice and it has a good storyline. You don't have to go back and forth too much which is nice. Puzzles were entertaining but not so hard that I got frustrated.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Have been looking for the double set for a while and finally hit on this.  A wonderful movie that is a must to see at Christmas
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is a game that everyone with a tablet of some sort should buy, it's amazing, every Month subway surfer changes to a place somewhere else in the map.You can buy characters, boards and powerups to use. It's an amazing app. I really recommend it!
0399230033|5.0|This book is short on words, but has incredible illustrations to tell the story. This book is delightful to read and very humorous as you pay attention to the details of the pictures. This book also is a great book for having dialog with a child while reading as you can ask questions about what is happening or what the child thinks might happen next. I love this book all the way around.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very fun game for children to play. I'm 23 years old and I even enjoy playing this game.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Apparently, not loving Downton is a thing since my husband refuses to watch it--citing too much drama. My 18 year old son, on the other hand, is refining his TV watching taste with this one. I got the second season through Amazon when Netflix only had season 1 available. I have streamed a few things through Amazon before and was just as happy with that experience as I was with this one.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Lincoln was a crafty politician and Daniel Day-Lewis was superb. So was Tommy Lee Jones.The last scene in the movie  was a masterpiece of irony and poignant sentiment.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I ordered this to transport my camera gear for vacation. I needed something I could pack with me easily. This little pack is great. Not too big but plenty of room and compartments. It is now my number one bag. It seems well made but at this price if it does break some day I will just buy another.
B00C32REYI|5.0|If you love James Blake, you won't be disappointed. Overgrown, Life Round Here, Retrograde, and Voyeur are my favorites on the album.
B005EY2XFC|5.0|This is a visually stunning, suspenseful, & action-packed film. It was on sale at Wal-Mart for $5.00, but I felt that the Blu-ray version would be far better & it was! Even though I'd seen the movie before, it still kept me on the edge of my seat. It's like film noir in High Definition. Great movie!
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Shocking, amazing video cinematography...  where did this come from, where has it been hiding.  Amazing movie.  If you like stunning and bizarre you'll love this.
B000Y5JFN4|5.0|I always loved the movie & often thought of getting it. When I punched it up on amazon.com & saw it was out on Blu-ray, I jumped on it. Being a musician myself & having played rock'n'roll (& heavy metal) for years, I could really relate to the material in this. Also, it pokes fun at some of the quirks of rockers & other people associated with the music business. Rob Reiner was great in this too.
B004RGHWIQ|5.0|This is an awesome movie, in 3D.  You need a 3D TV.  I recommend a new LG with &#34;passive&#34; 3D, first.  There are more and more 3D movies out and coming out.  Avatar, Titanic, Christmas Carol, Alice in Wonderland, etc., etc., etc.,  ...and now Jurassic Park, Oz, the Great and Powerful... and many more to come, new and re-mastered.<br /><br />3D TV is totally worth the price.  Just as good, (if not better) than the movie theater experience... right in your own home.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|I thought the fim was fast-paced & well-done. I especially liked the fact that there wasn't a lot of &#34;dead space&#34; or people sitting around not doing much. You could love the guy or hate him, but he definitely knew what he was doing & where he was going. Earlier on,  I had just seen this on a cable channel & they &#34;bleeped&#34; so much out & they cut info off at the end & it ruined the continuity of the film. So I ordered the Blu-ray & it is great! Has some cool extras too.
B000MGB6M8|5.0|Great movie, lots of fun, great action, with funny moments, very well filmed... and with Angelina (Brad if you're a girl), how cool is that?  Got to get this if you like good movies.
0634022296|5.0|This book is a great compilation of great songs, presented in an easy to read format.  I love it !! It could only be better if it were spiral bound, but it includes so many songs, I don't know how that could be accomplished.  I recommend this book to all Beatles fans.
B00371QQ0M|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of the movie (as some are), but I wanted a good quality version of this.  This (Blu-ray) is that.<br /><br />Those that suggest that the video quality is not top notch, here, are insane.  This &#34;Blu-ray&#34; is perfection.  I don't see how it could be made any better.  If you are a big fan of this movie and are wavering due to prior poor ratings of this &#34;disc&#34;, stop your wavering.<br /><br />This movie, in &#34;Blu-ray&#34;, is stunningly perfect.  You will not regret getting this based on image quality.  It's truly amazing.
B008JFUUQ2|4.0|No matter it is almost a youngsters' comedy and the end is predictable from the very beginning, the acting is very fresh and the performances are great. If you like musicals, this movie is for you. The cast is well balanced and the description of the &#34;a capella&#34; world is hilarious. I definitely recommend it.
B006H5120E|5.0|My wife and I saw the re-release, in 3D, at the theaters... and it was very good.  I already owned this on DVD, and wondered if it was worth getting again in 3D... it was.<br /><br />It seems better at home, on our 3D TV, than it was at the theater (in3D)???<br /><br />Of all the movies I now own and love in 3D, this is my favorite.  Shockingly, amazingly good in 3D.  If all the great movies can be &#34;re-mastered&#34; like this, in 3D, OMG...<br /><br />You must get a high quality 3D TV.  We have an LG, and love it.<br /><br />Then, go get this movie. You will thank me later.
B00181JGI2|5.0|There are a select few movies I get overly excited to introduce people to, this is one of them. Brilliant writing, hilarious characters, fluid and bizarre plot. The Coen brothers hit it out of the park with this movie! Possibly the most quotable flick of all time, or at least challenging The Princess Bride for the top spot. Casting was perfect and the actors nail it all the way around.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I'm a fan of these movies... getting them all in &#34;Blu-ray&#34;, well worth it.  The image quality is stunning, and for movies with such brilliantly done cinematography... how can you NOT get these in &#34;Blu-ray&#34;?  If not now, when?
B007PKDW44|5.0|I'm a 41 yr old SAHM and I can honestly say that I haven't blasted my car radio since I bought the STP CD back in '92...that is how much I freaking love this album. It's reminiscent of the hair bands I loved, a little Megadeth, a little Pantera, and certainly a little country....but I can overlook that for the jams :)
B000VZGK3K|5.0|On Blu-ray.  worth it...  One of the best recent movies I've seen.  If you are a fan of Howard Hughes, or this era, this is a must have movie.
B00A3CVFMM|3.0|It's good because of the emotional tie to the film. But on its own, it can't compare to the excellent fellowship soundtrack
B003NFM3JU|5.0|I've long been a fan of this MAJOR &#34;classic&#34; book and movie... done countless times.  I've seen every movie version and read the book endless times.<br /><br />This movie could possibly be the best example of the story yet.  In 3D, it is stunning, stunning, stunning.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|David Baldacci at his best! His cast of characters were realistic, The continuity of the story was great. Hard to put the book down until the final period!
B00006WKY9|3.0|Brings back memories of early 80's for me. The Scorpions were &#34;rock stars&#34; back then and I essentially picked this up to help complete my Scorpions discography
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Streaming quality was perfect, sound and video.<br /><br />THe movie was alright.  I enjoyed it but some of the characters are super weird to the point of being distracting from the story.
B000001EUP|4.0|But, I do now. Thirty years ago, I didn't think much of this album. I knew it had two &#34;hits&#34; on it but, it just never struck a chord with me at the time. As I grew older my taste for the stuff they call music today makes me want to vomit so, I have gone back through giving some artists a closer listen and this album turned out to be a real gem! I have always liked the Scorpions since the Lonesome Crow days and this album is even better than &#34;Love At First Sting&#34; in my opinion. It was less commercial than LAFS but, still had good musicianship and the songs are still reminiscent of Lovedrive and Animal Magentism.
B000SEGEKI|5.0|I'm loving this book and I am amazed that it portrays the reality of software development so well even after so many years!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I like the Feedly interface pretty well.  One thing I am not sure of is that when I use it, it does not seem to display all of my unread rss items.  I'm sure there is a setting for it.  It also could he that I'm flipping through a few items at a time, so it goes faster.
6303314015|5.0|The Lion King was purchased for my two younger grandchildren. They loved it. The tape was in pretty good condition and still works today. There was a small area that jumped at the beginning of the tape, but after the movie started it showed perfect. I would recommend it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Beautifully done.  Love the story line and characters.  Excellent costuming and staging.  Will be anxiously awaiting season four next year.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it's silly how much I enjoy playing this.  It's just mindless fun!  No thinking needed.  Been using it two months.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Enjoyed the book.....good read! I liked the characters and as a parent myself it makes you think what you would do.
B0019IB0II|5.0|Loved this book. Really informative and written for all to understand. Made the details of a stroke easy to explain to others.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|Loved it all. First saw it in the theater two days in a row. First one with my spouse and the second with nieces and nephews from ages 7 - 15.  The first night ended with the whole audience clapping.  Of course I had to buy it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|a dystopia novel where there is an entire civiztion living in the missle silos of nd. combines sociology, political sciene and engeneering into a copmplex plot.
1451695195|2.0|I actually turned to this book after reading the Wave, and wanting to believe so desperately that those we lose are not really gone.  This book was informative--Dr. Alexander gives a detailed account of his \\"NDE\\".  However, I found myself constantly rolling my eyes at what, to me, sounded pretty much like he was recounting all his successes as a physician, how amazing his recovery was, etc.  I'm certain it's all true, but for me, it detracted from what I hoped would be a spiritual book.  Also, there is a LOT of science in here--I think that's the point, really.  Too much for me, really.  One last point--I think the writing is pretty awful.  It's dry, and each chapter leaves with what I think the author wanted to be a \\"cliff hanger\\", but it's really transparent.  All in all, I wouldn't have purchased/read this book in retrospect.
B0019O6IWU|5.0|Since becoming a mother I've spent many nights cuddling my kids next to me.  While they dream I read.  I've never found a topic so intriguing as parenting.  I've long been settled on attachment parenting and have read extensively on the topic.  I could never put my finger on it, but the more I read the more I felt I needed to learn.  This book gave me what I needed.  In hind site what I needed was a respectful way to parent that allowed me to express and eventually completely dispel all the anger and resentment I have inside myself toward my own parents, so that I could parent my own kids the way I truly felt was right.  This book answered exactly how to do it.  Every question I've ever had has been answered and even points brought to light that I hadn't thought about yet.  The even bigger plus is that after presenting some of these incredibly simple and helpful techniques to my supervisor, he agrees that we can start implementing changes at work that will hopefully impact everyone there positively.  A 'two fer,' what could be better than that?!?<br /><br />Buy this book!  Everyone says communication is the key because we know its true, this book is a how-to-do-it-most-effectively guide, and by far the best one I've read to date.
B009R659L8|5.0|This was great it had different charators then usual, was great downloaded<br />to my ipad, great reading only I finished to quickly.

B000FA675C|5.0|This a well written suspenseful book.  I would recommend this book to anyone looking for action.  From start to finish, I was never bored and never eager for the book to end.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Firefly,  is very enjoyable for me. I like the sound track , and its cowboy, space and alien twist.<br />Remamber this was on before Cowboys and Aliens.
B007L96SI6|5.0|excelent
B000KLRUKC|5.0|Was there ever a grander grand opera than Verdi's Aida, and have there ever been any grander recordings of it than Karajan's two stereo performances on Decca and EMI? Coincidentally, both Decca and EMI chose to reissue their recordings at about the same time, in 2007, and while the earlier Decca interpretation may in some ways be the grander of the two, it's the later, 1979 EMI recording that has the slight sonic advantage. I hadn't remembered how slowly and deliberately Karajan conducted the earlier Decca performance. While the singers are splendid and the chorus is even more intelligible than on the later EMI recording, Karajan's odd, calculated tempos and sometimes hesitant direction tend to stand out.  Twenty years on, he had lightened up, and the EMI reading sounds more spontaneous.<br /><br />Interestingly, I had also not remembered that Decca cut their recording slightly. There is a whole chunk of music missing from the beginning of Act II, Scene 2, just before the \\"Triumphal March.\\" I suppose that's why they could fit the opera onto two discs rather than three. Anyway, I had additionally forgotten how very good the recording still sounds.  This is quite a delight.<br /><br />John J. Puccio<br />Classical Candor
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|A fun game.  It's a little repetitive for my tastes.  My grandchildren like it and play it sometimes. Thank you

B00280LYIM|4.0|Well obviously another good book of the series and another MUST READ next book. I don't remember who made the books for the kindle but props who did this is a way better way to read the series so I CONTINUE.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am not a fast reader, but I FLEW through this book!  Very entertaining! I already started the Silo series. I would highly recomend.  Thank you Hugh Howey for a great read!
B00A6VAW9W|4.0|Thought it might be &#34;too country for me, but the writing is really good and the harmonizations between the 3 of them and the background singers is wonderful !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004J09ONG|4.0|This is a heartwarming classic.  It is well done.  You get to escape to another world. I love it each time I see it.
B008SOS63S|5.0|This rates up there with the best of them. Mr. Bonamassa is a true master of the strings. With the guest appearance of John Hiatt and Paul Rodgers it really gets you into the music. The vocals of Beth Hart brings depth and and a more family feel to round this album out.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It was helpful to me and my family because of that I rate a five<br />My 10 year old son found it real easy to use.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Hate to admit that i had never heard of Mr. Bonamassa until i happened across  a show on PBS. I ordered it within the next hour. I have never felt such a feeling of musical passion that wanted to be shared. I love acoustical guitar and envy someone with the talent to play with such heart. This is Blues with a bit of Bluegrass and so much more. I can see why Mr. King {B.B.} gave him such high praise. Put this on a good system, turn it up and melt away.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|jewel legends tree of life has been fun so far up to level twelve and still going waiting for purchase option to come up
B004NOH9LC|4.0|Found his scowling off putting but he came thru in the end. A cute movie which is why a gave it four stars.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|Having seen both the play and now the movie,  I think I prefer the play.  This because the play had excellent singers.  Although the movie was good,  the singing left alot to be desired (especially Hugh J).  But overall it is worth seeing.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|What a great story! For these two to meet and get together...what an unlikely pair! It is an incredible love story about compromise. And just the right amount of spice!!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|At first I had to build a lot of houses,but then I bought some more land then I was on track:)
B00846REIS|5.0|Good read ALTHOUGH it mirrored Fifty Shades. I got a little tired of Eva's constant &#34;Am I good enough&#34; &#34;Why would he want ME&#34; throughout the whole book.
B008COII1Y|3.0|Decent movie. Not a very large budget but i think they tell their story well. Not a waste of time to watch, decent movie.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Not a bad story line although I thought it mirrored the Fifty Shades of Grey a little. it was not bad. It really was BAD when the publishers kep pushing back the release date for the third book.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Not since the Sound of Music, have I wanted to watch a musical over and over, taken in by each character's performance every time.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Here ended the most poignant love story I have read in a long time! So easy to get caught up in this eries!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is close enough to mario bros that it made me happy and very nostalgic. A wonderful time waster.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Love the movie, love the Amazon streaming experience. Only possible room for improvement could be a mobile app, to better navigate the Amazon app on smart TVs.
1400052181|5.0|So glad to find this book at a great price.  Required reading for all Freshman at UAB.  Son loved the book but will probably never read again... nice to not pay a fortune for it!!
B000FA675C|5.0|I would highly recommend this book (and Dan Brown's other books).... it is a great combination of fiction/non fiction.  Dan Brown has a great gift in being able to engage the reader .
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Great insight into war experiences.<br />A really good read.<br />Would recommend for teens and adults to get a true feel about war!
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|This game is so good, had a lot of fun playing with friends on the internet :)<br />It is easy to understand how to play and you can unlock powerful abilities by playing the game.
B004SIP6BI|5.0|And now it is one of my friends favorites.  Purchased as a birthday gift that was much appreciated.  She's a chocoholic - LOL
B000007PSL|5.0|beyond the thunder was beyond incredible. This was Neal's best solo album. Really tranquil, clever and relaxing. I highly recommend
B0074VA2T2|3.0|Did not discover this until my grandson was really too old for it but it is cute, but definitely for a 2 year old, at 3 he was bored senseless in seconds- but for a 2 yr old, I think its adorable.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|This book was very good,  Always kept me on my toes to see what was happening next.  Was quite surprised of the murderer.  I would recommend this to all my mystery friends.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A great read that pulls you into the story right away. The decision to present the story through the different eyes of the people involved is a great touch.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|A great mystery with its story can also be laced with wisecracks and asides.  DeMille has created a character perfect with them.
B000FA675C|5.0|This book is great!! (And the movie does not really do it justice  even though Tom Hanks is wonderful)<br />I lost myself in that story and couldn't put it down. I was sitting in Las Vegas at the airport, waiting for my flight to Tucson and I was so immersed in my riveting book that, when a lady spoke to me and told me that she thought the book was really good, I jumped (she almost gave me a heart attack) and threw my Kindle up in the air!<br />I recommend the 'Da Vinci Code' to everybody - great story, great subject, great read!
B000FA5SMK|5.0|DeMille's character, John Corey, is a smart aleck to the ninth power.  Love the twists in the story and all the laughs to go along with it.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I love dog stories.  This one was wonderful....not overplayed.  His call to duty was wonderful....made me think of the dogs our military use....The only problem I had with it was not being able to see it clearly at the end (of course this was due to the tears in my eyes, and running down my face, and grabbing tissues)  I had to replay the last 20 minutes of the show and even knowing how it ended, I cried again....but fewer tears this time.  Anyone who loves animals...ESPECIALLY DOGS....will love this movie.  Just make sure you have enough tissues in stock.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Preston and Child did it again. Love Pendergast. Love the surprises. Expect this saga to continue based on how it ended.
B005OT2YVA|4.0|I do think the first one is tbe best though.. but I like the graphics in this movie you do have to see this one as well. .
B008OOYALE|5.0|I have to say I bought this game hoping for a fun A cityville type game and I got much more. The cute dragons and farming elements make the game just charming 5 stars
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I downloaded this and can't get get enough of using it.  The features are easy to use and the alarm wakes me up and I sleep deep.  Thanks for an app that will get its use twice over.
B007MC8YLQ|3.0|Not my kind of game or maybe I was just tired.I like Spider better or regular solitair. try it you may like it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Totally, like, totally fer real bra. Totally and fully total. Gnarly. Bra. How many more words? Oh three more? Totally.
B0063M22QO|4.0|hard to stop playing.But when you get to the end of level 1 you have to buy next level. I went back and played first level again. I don't think it was the same.
B00340O3KQ|4.0|It was fun trying to keep up with who was who. The idea of switching characters was unique, at least it was to me. I found it interesting.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|My kids and I have been playing this game. It teaches about gardening, taking care of plants and bugs. You really cannot go wrong with the Dr. Pand games!
B00A5FPQBI|4.0|The film was exciting. It was obvious how poverty caused the two young boys to resort to crime from an early age.
006220629X|5.0|The Prisoner of Heaven is the third book in the Cemetery of Forgotten Books series by Carlos Ruiz Zafon.<br /><br />Carlos Ruiz Zafon hooked me with The Shadow of the Wind (Book 1), left me desiring a little more with The Angel's Game (Book 2), but tied it all together fabulously with The Prisoner of Heaven (Book 3).<br /><br />The author says that the books can be read in any order, and when you change the order, you change the way you experience the story.  This seems to be true, however, I loved reading the books in the order they came out, where The Shadow of the Wind and The Angel's Game were somewhat related, but I wasn't sure how until The Prisoner of Heaven came along and basically slapped me in the face with its awesomeness.<br /><br />The Prisoner of Heaven may have been my favorite of the three books.  I could not put it down, reading all 300 pages in less than a day.<br /><br />Daniel Sempere is happily married and running the family bookstore with his father and best friend Ferm&iacute;n Romero de Torres.  Ferm&iacute;n will soon be married, but something is in the way.  When Ferm&iacute;n opens up to Daniel about what really has occurred in his past, secrets are revealed, questions are answered, and more questions arise.<br /><br />The Prisoner of Heaven was a phenomenal read that sucked me in and kept me turning the pages without wanting to put the book down.  Carlos Ruiz Zafon did a great job tying up loose ends while still leaving the book open at the end for another in the series (which I would read in a heartbeat if you are writing it!).  And of course, Daniel visits the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, which is one of my favorite fictional places in the entire world.<br /><br />I highly recommend that you read all three books in this series, but I have to say, I think this book was the best of all three so far!<br /><br />Who's up for a trip to Barcelona???<br /><br />I received this book from TLC Book Tours in exchange for a fair and honest review.<br /><br />What do you think about reading a series out of order?<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />Rebecca @ Love at First Bookyou think about reading a series out of order?<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />Rebecca @ Love at First Book
0345803485|1.0|It's such a sad comment that so many women want to be abused - physically - verbally - emotionally, be tortured and be sexually tortured, be treated like objects that can be thrown away, discarded, chopped up ... Stories and authors who glorify sadism and torturers and people love it?  negative 5 stars. And the women cry out they are treated subserviently, as second class citizens.<br /><br />When you (and I'm female) treat people with respect and act respectfully, others treat you with respect. If you wish to be abused, you just attract abusers and users into your life. Hope everyone involved in this project get what they deserve.
B0062OCNAI|5.0|I love this book.  I could hardly put it down.  It shows the  love of family and the depth of that love.  The belief that there is an afterwards.
B00BF11STU|3.0|Is Zero Dark Thirty a good movie?<br /><br />Yes - Top notch acting, good pacing, good cinematography, interesting story..<br /><br />No - Loaded with government propaganda, justifying torture (\\"Sure, I'm gonna torture you, but its your fault, blub-glub-glub..\\") ..<br /><br />Its a mixed bag, but well worth watching purely as a film.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|This  book definitely keeps you wanting more. It's hard to put down! Good read with an interesting twist! Good for suicide awareness
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|I sincerely hope that this doesn't become a trend in Blu-Ray, but I'm not surprised that Disney is doing this. The 3D Blu-Ray and 2D Blu-Ray are separate releases. This wouldn't be a huge problem if the cost wasn't the same as previous releases that combine both. But unfortunately they are. Yep, if you want to own both the 2D and 3D Blu-Rays of this movie on Amazon as of now, it will cost you $63.<br /><br />This benefits no-one, not even Disney, as owning a combination of both 2D and 3D was an incentive for 2D watchers to upgrade to 3D.<br /><br />If you are wondering why this is such a big deal, or why many reviewers are passionately giving this product one star, just think about the long term effects. Although movie studios are trying to push people to downloading movies, there are still many people who still prefer to buy the Blu-ray versions and are willing to pay for it, because they desire the quality that downloadable content cannot reproduce. If you're reading this review, you're probably one of those people.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|Purchased the extra, but would be great if this little kitty do other things.  But know matter what we all neede to laugh and this kitty does it.
B004LROUNG|3.0|Pretty fast read. Always love Grisham. This was my first ebook and I look forward to reading more John Grisham books.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Although I have only played this game once, I know I will like it very much as it is challenging and fun.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Fascinating look into an impractically taboo subject. All of the performances were wonderful. I love movies like this that are told with a subtle hand.
1416511946|5.0|ALL I CAN SAY IS WOW!!! Definately a person who underestimated himself during this miserable year, but it wouldn't have made him the person he is today, everything is a learning experience and stimes we have to experience the worse to become better people.  I wanted to jump in the book and try to save him from himself and his demons but at the same time he had to do it, it's what he wanted....will never forget his story and more so appreciate him even more after reading his miraculous story, made me cry many times NIKKI SIXX...YOU ARE AN INSPIRATION TO MANY PEOPLE❤
B001XUPGLY|5.0|Directed by Leonard Nimoy this Star Trek movie brings new dimensions to the first Star Trek cast, and with a new kind of nemesis.  Humanity itself.  Released in 1986 it earned 4 Academy Awards, The film shows how the extinction of Humpback brings by commercial whaling directly results in an extinction event for humankind itself, centuries later.<br /><br />The wit and humor of this film separates it from all the other Star Trek films, but it was Nimoy's foreshadowing of things to come that likewise makes it prophetic because 17 years later in 2003, Stanford University released a study that focused on the genetic harm being done to whale species by commercial whalers.<br /><br />The study clearly showed had previous estimates were wrong but more importantly showed that whale populations are being reduced to point where they may longer be genetically viable.  Yet, the pressure remains to hunt these species into extinction.  That's why this film should be required viewing in every biology class in the nation.
0060989157|5.0|thouroughly enjoyed...sadness and happiness all in one! how they survived is beyond me, but one thing is for sure, four talented people who KICK ASS and showed some big knobs how its done!!!  LOVED IT FAARRKEN!!!
B00A14V0MM|3.0|I bought this just for the song by Alabama Shakes (which rocks!).  The album is ok, I will probably enjoy it more once I see the movie.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|each song is powerful and meaningful in its own way! James Michael's voice gives me goosebumps, whilst Dj's guitar gives it power and and the lyrics well what can I say, written by one of the most Phenomenal artists that has blessed us in this world with his gifted talent, rich and powerful words, laughed, cried and was shocked throughout the book which I couldn't put down, hits home only to realise just how lucky some of us are in this world who have families that makes us feel loved and wanted...Takes a special person to publicise his personal nightmare to help others make the same mistakes he did and listening to the soundtrack just makes it even more heartfelt.....THANK YOU
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The movie is great, the book is better.  It is funny and serious and an all around good story.  I recommend both!
B0007TKNL0|4.0|So very romantic, although Gerry's singing doesn't quite live up the the moniker of \\"angelic\\" (not as good as Ben Lewis!), it is surprisingly good! But he is rather romantic! Emmy Rossum is spectacular. Singing like that at her age...Amazing!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I have loved dinosaurs ever since I was a kid, and to go along with that, I am a HUGE Jurassic Park fan! But this game was a total let down because it doesn't even work! It always crashes whenever I try to play it. I haven't even gotten passed the loading screen!
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I have been watching this on YouTube. But when it was pulled, even the movie was not satisfying enough like this concert was. Just had to have it. The vocalists in the concert are astounding. So much better than the movie.
B008K9UZY4|2.0|Maybe it's the tablet, maybe its the app but its hard to look at - liked the version on the old school game system better
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Love Sherlock Holmes and his deductive powers. Simple, if you keep your eyes and mind open. Watson is a great side kick.
B00122N0MU|4.0|I just like their style.  They have an artistry that is lacking in the more modern stuff.  I wouldn't go out of my way to buy most music from more recent musicians.
B000L3CHC0|5.0|Bought this watch as a gift and he definitely liked it. The packaging and the presentation of the watch is worth a mention especially if you are planning to gift it to someone.
B007BT0RKG|1.0|There was just not enough information on these maps.  I liked the Mobile Soft app much better than this one.
B004LX0D36|5.0|I always love Jane Austen even if by some standards they are prudish and formulaic. This is an especially good story and I love being able to see the great illustrations.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Rewarding play, hehe. Nicely designed game, with the prize bonuses &amp; notification when max coins have accumulated, etc. Table &amp; coins not as slippery as the other (frustrating) coin game I tried. Great app!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Easy to play, grear size, very good edition for Kindke Fire.  Excellent entertainment and fun for the whole family regardless of age,
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|This movie had me laughing out loud several times. I really enjoyed it. It made me laugh because I am 40 and my husband and I have been through some of these same situations...For those who didnt like it, come back and watch it when your kids are teenagers, when your parents are more like your kids, and when laughing until you cry with your spouse is what gets you through it all...
1591844096|5.0|Listen to the 5 star reviews.  Seth has made numerous & astute points. Take heed to what he says, and you will be the last to be laidoff.<br /><br />Here is a very small sampling of the many statements that are worth quoting from this book.<br /><br />\\"..the resistance.  The loud voice of the lizard brain telling you that you can't possibly do it, that you don't deserve it, that people will laugh at you. We don't have a talent shortage, we have a shipping shortage...the linchpin is able to invent a future, fall in love with it, live in it--then abandon it on a moment's notice...Successful people learn from failure, but the lesson they learn is a different one.  They don't learn that they shouldn't have tried in the first place, and they don't learn that they are always right and the world is wrong and they don't learn that they are losers.  They learn that the tactics they used didn't work or that the person they used them on didn't respond.\\"<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|This movie reached all time low ratings from me.  The language was so unlike normalcy in real life.  I am surprised that you guys asked me to review it.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|Here's another case &lt;G> that they should make room for TEN STAR's. You can look at my review's and know I mean what I say. Yes it costs three times as much but it is worth it. It is the first part of April I will edit as needed.<br /><br />dray<br /><br />JUST DOESN'T GET AHY BETTER
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I like Daniel Craig, but the story is very much written by an amateur smoking pot.  All the great Bond Movies had some sense of reality and were believable.<br />Oh for someone who could write a story that matched Ian Fleming's ideas of what a 007 really is and does.
B002APU580|5.0|Great when you want a quicker Darcy fix.  The longer version is much better, but this will do in a pinch.
B008966SI0|5.0|Just a lot of fun and happiness! GREAT!!! Buy it and audition it with a smile! Happy to own it......
B009AMANH4|1.0|I'm a dedicated movie buff. All the hoopla, notwithstanding, I found it impossible to \\"get into\\" this film. It is a strung together series of vignettes which quickly exhaust one's attention reservoir. The opening scene wherein Union soldiers recite, word for word, the Gettysburg address to Lincoln  is corny to to the extreme. The first glimpse of Sally Field emphasizes her head rising only to the level of Lincoln's navel is a riot. Above all, the movie is BORING. Very disappointing.
B003Y7PML8|5.0|Sipping on Burbon with a big smile...!!!!MOFI is the King of Recordings...Period....MOFI is the King of Recordings...Period...MOFI is the King of Recordings...Period...MOFI is the King of Recordings...Period
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is so enjoyable and includes so many of my favorite actors and actresses.  I will be purchasing the whole set soon.  Can hardly wait for Season 4.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A good story with a profound philosophy and outlook on life's challenges. It is told in a unique way with  characters that you care about.
B000SEI230|5.0|Best book I have ever read. It heart wrenching an  an emotional roller coaster that will<br /> leave you crying at the end. Nicholas sparks is my favorite author and his books always make me cry at the end. If you love romantic books with a great story line and twist, this is the book for you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|very good reading!  This kept me wanting to read more and waiting for what would happen next.  It was refreshing to remember that families are important to some people.  This was interesting reading because it was not only suspenseful, but rewarding to find that the author focused on some people
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app rocks I use it every night! Totally get it.  I would never choose to get a different alarm app than this one.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was so easy to finish because I could not put it down.  The suspense kept me with my eyes on the pages.  A beautiful love story as well as a story of how battered and abused women have a hard time getting away from their abuser.  This book also shows women how they can work their way out of despair if they can stay focused.  Of course abusers will not stop and that is scary.<br /> Wonderful story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its better than temple run its different than other games and its just so fun plus its even adicting to adults everybody loves this game
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have ever read.  Nicholas sparks writes so that the reader cannot leave the work.  I had to just keep reading and reading and was not so happy when it ended only because I enjoyed it so much.  I was sad that it couldn't have ended differently, but there was no other way to have a happy ending.  This book was my favorite.  (For now)  Nicholas Sparks is a great writer
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing book that had inspired many people young and old but all I can s as y is wow! !!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a page turning book, i don't feel like my money was wasted. I am currently reading the second book ,it's not as good as first book.
B00013M6NK|4.0|No surprises - works in the camera after charging overnight.  Held the charge well.  A good deal at the price paid.
0307474259|5.0|Shippment was quick and the book was in a good condition. I can't wait to read it. My friend told me about this book and I wanted to order it from Amazon since the price was so affordable. Thank you!!
B000FCK65W|5.0|This book was selected for my monthly book club. I really enjoyed the story. The way the book was written made it really easy for me picture what was happening as if I was in the story. I also loved how the author made you feel for the characters.
B00003CY0V|1.0|This is quite possibly the worst movie ever made. Not in a so-bad-it's-good sense. For example travolta's  character has a black person lynched. Not to make some civil rights statement but that's just how clueless an arbitrary the writers were.  Why didnt the actors rebel?  Nor is it A-list actors like don cheadle, Hugh Hackman, Halle berry, struggling with a bad script.  No they are giving the worst performances if there lives. Hysterically toned bad acting.  Travolta's performance makes his role in the dismal battlefield earth look like triumphant comeback performance by comparison.The director can't sustain any tension or find interesting viewpoints or come up with credible computer hacking simulacra. I'm not judging this as a fine drama but as an action flick.  It just reeks.  The problem with giving thus one star is that. I feel like I need to now upgrade every movie I previous considered to be one star. Sets a new low on every level.
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|this movie is awful for so many reasons, which nobody will read because it already has 3000+ reviews... i just wanted to add my 1-star review to the pile. speaking of piles, this movie was a steaming one. i only sat through it because i was stuck on a 6 hour bus ride and the driver put this in.
B005XLN97M|4.0|I bought for my Friend's daughter and she liked it a lot because of lots of barbie accessories as well as.
B00136S0NE|5.0|I watched the movie as part of a date night with my boyfriend and fell in love the music of this movie. I just had to get the album. ;)
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Fantastic album! Had it on repeat for ages after i got it! So glad Bowie if back and making music
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan, since I saw her first public appearance in England's talent contest, has captured the heart of those who admire her and her tremendous talent.These are the songs she loves best. I have shared it with many of the millions who egard her as a very special talent

B00466HNHM|5.0|It was  a necessity to update my regulard dvd, vhs to a blu-ray version as collector of all movies and music of the late great Whitney Houston.
B004RKXW0E|5.0|The item arrive on time and was in perfect condition. There were no scratches on it at all, and my nephew will not stop talking about it. Thank you so much for the product.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I have this on my Fire HD and my iPad 2. I enjoy it more on the Fire. Puzzles are very colorful, I like the 200+ piece option best. Great to be able to indulge in a jigsaw without worry of losing pieces or having to set one up hoping pets don't eat a piece or two!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|this is well thought out and fun, one of the best app games I've tried out, will definitely keep this one
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Funny, short episodes and good humor. It is the perfect end of the day, settle down and be done show.
B0059XTUVI|4.0|While I agree the movie spends too much speculating on Baroness Thatcher's dementia, there is no denying the brilliance of Streep's performance. Her ability to capture Thatcher's every gesture is incredible to say the least.<br /><br />Like 'The Queen,' 'The Iron Lady' gives a sympathetic view of Margaret Thatcher. The scenes showing her family persevering through the bombing of Britain as well as her father's work ethic helped shape her political philosophy as well as her will.<br /><br />It should be noted it was the Russians that dubbed her, 'The Iron Lady.' One can only imagine what must have gone through their heads when she sent the British Navy almost 8,000 miles to take back an island of 1,800 civilians. It was a clear message to the soviets as to what would happen should the cold war ever heat up on her shores.<br /><br />One must ask the question; if the British Embassy in Benghazi had been attacked on Thatcher's watch, what would she have done?<br /><br />Gone to Vegas?<br /><br />by David Feeney, Author [[ASIN:B00CWRQAJY Terror On The High Seas]]
B00136JS12|5.0|I have loved this selection since the 1970's when I first bought it in 8- track format. love that Amazon had it on sale this CD is hit after hit after hit
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Just finished this novel and recommend it highly, as does my book club of 8 ladies.  It IS an emotional roller coaster, so brace yourself, but the writing is solid, and the characters are very interesting.  We found the Victorian flower language fascinating, too.
0061537969|3.0|Cute perspective from a dog, quick read, the plot twist in the last third of the book is unnecessary and &#34;cheapens&#34; the story
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|Since his very first album to his latest, I don't think there wasn't a single album I was disappointed. His sound is always elegant and different every single time.<br /><br />I love it.
1400049628|5.0|This is a fantastic zombie handbook, loads of fun. A blast to read in a group or just to pass the time.
030726999X|5.0|I've devoured the full series of three books.  I found them a fascinating read and quickly picked up on the fact that the lead character had a handicap.  I was pleased I figured out exactly which kind before the last book revealed the issue.  Great read!!

0723259674|5.0|This series of wonderful books were sent to two four year old girls who really love the stories and pictures.  Their parents were amazed that Beatrix Potter had written so many stories!  They have reported the pictures are fabulous!  The whole family is enjoying the books.  Another nice feature is the size of the books.  They are wonderful for small hands.  We sent the books as a gift and I don't believe we could have found one better!
