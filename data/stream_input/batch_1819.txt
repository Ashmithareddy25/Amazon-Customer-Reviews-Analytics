B005H0IW6W|5.0|This was a gift for my niece and she plays it even in July! It got here quickly and in good condition. Thanks!
B009P5K4HK|5.0|This 2 cd set is lovely.  Really enjoyed the dvd of her trip to Ireland.  The world is at a loss.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|I really thought &#34;whats the big deal&#34; about this game? I hear alot of people talking about it and being addicted to it but it just didn't happen with me. Sorry.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I love this series ... made me interested in politics.. I like it alot more this way then the real stuff.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|This game &quot; Symphony of Eternity &quot; really reminds me Dragon quest,  FF,  Golden sun series on GBA. I used to spend hours and hours on those &quot; Japanese RPG &quot; until they started to focus too much on the graphics. I thought Kotoniki ( developer) did fantastic job on this game for everything. Attractive characters, solid storyline,  simple game control .. I can't think of any negatives for this game especially they offer pretty low price ( $2.99).<br />Yes,  now FF is available on kindle and FF is fantastic game but the price is quite steep ($ 15.99),  so if you just want to see how RPG works on kindle before $15.99 investment, you can try this game. I 'm sure you will enjoy it!
B007HO392S|5.0|There is not much one can say about a cd. Iike the singer, the songs and I just like it
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This was a gift for my wife. She was very happy with the movie and she rated it 5 stars. A very moving movie.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This game is so OFF The Wall that it is more fun when you play it with a friend or family member. It is very addicting when you can't sleep, and better than taking a sleeping pill...lol
B004SBQGHS|1.0|I thought this game would be engaging for adults as I had read about my friends on Facebook playing this game and moving through it quickly. I purchased this game thinking it would be a nice diversion. It is so simple any idiot could play it. It is great for kids 10 and under but anyone older than 10 would find it boring. My husband played it once; I haven't played it and won't bother. Wish I could get my money back.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is wonderful the characters are wonderful and intriguing. I would recommend this to all my friends and family.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Wow much faster paced than book one. Get ready for a rebellion of an ending in book three.  Go katniss!
B001J29H9I|5.0|I have listened to this album several times in a row. Even though it's a cover album of Junior's work, The Black Keys difintely put their own spin on the record.<br /><br />If you are only familar with the Black Keys from the albums El Camino and Brothers, this is a very different album. But you should give it a try.<br /><br />Love the album art as well. I bought a frame to store the album on the wall as art.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|great knife sharpener handy tool for whats needed of it thank you for fast ship also! Great product fast process
B004EK926K|4.0|A very good retake of the old classic.  The animation is outstanding and almost real. It is a great movie to watch with the family during the Christmas season..<br />Our family hadn't see this since it came out originally, and we weren't sure if we wanted to commit an evening to it. It was well worth the time and we all enjoyed it.<br />Only cons was that sometimes Jim Carey interjects comedy when not expected.  We loved it in total.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|This is classic Rod Stewart.  The album is wonderful and really put everyone in the house in the Christmas mood.  You cant go wrong and with Amazon pricing what are you waiting for??
B0050SYS5A|4.0|I was very skeptical based on all of the negative reviews but couldn't take the thought of shoving my couch around each time I wanted to use the Kinect. I decided to risk it. I'm glad I did. Installed easily and did not scratch my Kinect like others have said. Maybe if I keep taking it off and on it would scratch it, but so far so good.<br /><br />As far as getting it to work, I didn't experience any of the issues noted in other reviews. I made sure it was installed correctly (the green Kinect light will show through a pinhole on the Zoom, letting me know it was positioned over the lenses) and I didn't panic when the Kinect saw all black.<br /><br />I went into my xbox settings and recalibrated the Kinect using the card. It looks like there a dark halo in the sensor preview, but continue to press forward with calibration. Again, don't panic. My kinect did have a problem seeing the floor, but it didn't seem to be a stopping point in the setup so, I continued to calibrate.<br /><br />Once calibration was complete, I played my heart out and it tracked fine. Where Kinect used to cut the preview off around my knee area, it was showing my feet. It's like adding an extra 3-4 ft to your living room as far as your xbox is concerned.<br /><br />Give it a try... as always, your experience may vary, but I think a majority of these reviews are people who either freaked out during the install, lost patience, or are under 15 years of age and give up. The company has videos on the web to show you how to install properly and various FAQs state that the black halo on the sensor preview is normal, the Kinect tracks through it just fine and it doesn't affect gameplay whatsoever.<br /><br />My .02!
B000055Y0X|5.0|If you do not own this movie then you need to buy it period. It's one of those movies. If you watch it and don't enjoy it then I would suggest that you don't say that outloud because I personally guarantee that someone will argue with you about the genious that is this movie. So please don't bother... Just buy the movie.
B005V4FJC4|4.0|I have enjoyed She and Him in their previous 2 albums, and this was a nice festive follow up to add to the mix. M. Ward's unique arrangements of classic songs add a new twist to old favorites, and Zooey's voice (which has a timeless appeal) is charming throughout the album. There is a sense of frivolity, even in the slower tunes, which makes the whole collection of songs cohesive and fun to listen to.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|This is fun. I play around with it to find a melody I am in the mood for. So far each night  is different since there are not only many choices but you can also mix them. I enjoy trying different combinations. It also plays for an extended amount of time. Really nice and appropriate for what it is intended for.
B007Q0OV6Q|3.0|The child was delighted with it, but I thought it was a little cheesy for the price. The box is the calendar.
B006ZE66P8|4.0|I love good art work, fun expressive characters, easy to read  to grandchildren. We read this first before watching a film version.
B005K2YTG4|5.0|This sleeve, made specifically for kindle, is exactly what I was looking for. It has lots of options for colors. The sleeve is heavy duty both on the outside and the inside. The inside has a nice fabric that is soft and won't scratch your kindle screen. It's not weighty or bulky and it's easy to carry around.
B0015XASFS|3.0|Maybe it's all in the timing, but I didn't enjoy this CD as much as I had hoped to.  I really like Josh Groban's voice and music....
B0029XFNAI|5.0|The visual quality is excellent!  I wasn't sure how it would be since it's an older movie, but it is great!
0684853523|5.0|I was surprised by how Stephen King laid this book out.  I loved how he shared his own personal journey and story as part of how he became a writer.  I found this to be an interesting and inspiring book.  He does share helpful insights on how to become a better writer, as well.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King always has a good book. Could not put it down! Thought I would know the ending but was surprised. Take a chance and read it. You won't regret it.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|I ordered this movie and it got to me in three days. So fast. I am very satisfied. It is a gift so can't review movie. I heard it was a great one.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Really kept my interest until the final story.  Not too hard,  that if you get stuck you can get a hint to go in the right direction.  Graphics were very cool.<br />(
B000000OF6|5.0|This set has all of my favorites - disc one especially rarely leaves my cd player!  Disc two is pretty good too.
B004EPZ0H0|4.0|Raises a lot of challenging questions about scientific research.  There are a lot of characters in the book and at times this is confusing.  Generally well written with a few places where the story seemed to lose itself.
B00005LOUP|5.0|I have to admit I was skeptical about this one because of my deep love of the cartoon version, but I love it almost as much.  There are times when the Grinch is very &#34;Jim Carey&#34; and connections to other characters he has done can be seen/heard, but the story, costumes, and overall whimsical Christmas spirit affect more than make up for that.
B003DT194G|5.0|My mom loves this movie she's f.rom Texas!!!!  her fav actor is John Wayne but henry fonda does this movie justice!!!
B001AQR3IU|5.0|Fun story! I find stories like this to be lacking today. Glad to see this as an innocent fantasy driven story without too much of all the violence and gore that you really see out there today for shock value. Too many times you see a movie an get surprised by all the violence. This is a charming take on heroes vs. villains that is funny, witty and in some ways fresh. Glad to own it and have seen it.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This was a book club pick ... and very valuable information for our friends and families, as we have all been touched by Alzheimers in one way or another.  I recommend this book to friends with loved ones going through this insidious disease.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|&#34;John Adams&#34; is great because it is based upon David McCullough's book by the same name. I would recommend it for teens and adults. It brings our second president into sharp focus. It shows his complicated relationship with Thomas Jefferson and how much he leaned upon his wife Abigail. It covers all of the critical events in Adams' life.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|I have used this product more times than I care to admit.  We all need to decompress sometimes and Tom Cat does it for me.  When someone makes me mad, I pop Tom in the face until he falls back and when he stands up, I punch him again.  Talking Tom Cat II is also a lot of fun and Talking Pierre (the Parrot) All of them are free and can be very tranquilizing.  I know plenty of adults who have downloaded this program and feel it is therapeutic.  My accountant turned me on to him and loves him.  When he gets finished with his clients for the day, he says everything he wanted to say to them but couldn't to Tom including &#34;Shut Up&#34; and when Tom says it back to him, he cracks up. All of his stress lines release from his face.  Sounds silly but can be quite relaxing at the end of a hectic day.
B005LAJ17M|1.0|I paid $42 for a brand new first season of Homeland--in Blueray. Instead I just received a bunch of loose DVD's. No DVD case--and of course this is now NOT gift material (it was intended for christmas gift).NOT what I wanted or expected, and I am seriously annoyed at Amazon and this seller. Will not buy from seller again.
1611761182|4.0|It is very good, and draws you into the characters. Am looking forward to the last book in the Trilogy
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The story has you from the first page.  I don't need to see the film.  I love it on my Kindle
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't get it.  The book started off ok but then it just drags on with nothing happening.  The other two are even worse.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. The price was excellent (less than a coffee), and was commonly recommended by Amazon to read this title. I did and I was not disappointed. There were a few points in the story that seemed to be very similar to other fantasy genre books, but I don't think this is a poor characteristic of Blood Song, but perhaps the genre in general. It's a fast paced book, well written in parts, and would recommend this book to others.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game doesn't have the graphics but it is extremely addictive! I played this game for hours until my tablet's battery ran out.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|Arg! This was the season that got us hooked! We've now purchased all the seasons and are eagerly waiting for the latest. Curse you, Showtime! Such a great show.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is by far one of my favorite Nicholas sparks books! I could not put it down.  So many twists and turns and still as romantic as ever!
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|excellent product  good price  had my black chanel stolen  and like the skagen better  (the clasp a bit tricky but with some practise it works perfectly)
B006LSZECO|5.0|It took me a few chapters to get into this book, but then I was hooked! I was sure I knew who took/killed Amy as I am sure you will too,  dumb bitch dumb bitch is all I have to say. Lol, thanks for the good read!
B00979CS50|5.0|I have already recommended this cd to friends. New music  from Neil it does not get much better for old guys.
B004Q3SGWG|3.0|This was a decent movie, I just didn't really love it.  It was exactly what you would expect... a guy has a rock fall on his arm and then he is trapped there for 127 hours until he eventually has to cut off his own arm.
B000QE1U9K|5.0|I got this. the price was right and there was no question of the quality of the recording. last one for the collection.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this is an app that not only my kids absolutely love but I do too! I love the different breeds of dragons you can make and its a surprise every time! very awesome graphics and amazing colors that just pull you in for hours of fun! now all you need to come up with is a Zombie Story and you'll have me completely hooked! ;)
B002ZG98LO|5.0|needed this to complete collection. Brody is great in this. outside of his norm. can't wait for the sequel. due in 2014 I think
0393057658|5.0|Works as expected. Would buy it again and give it as a gift.  The price was right and that is my story.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|For none Dead fans this is a must, but be sure to watch the other two seasons first. Season 2 is a bit of a yawn at times but really builds to how AMAZING Season 3 is. Do whatever you have to, get into this show
B001P9KR8U|5.0|Works as expected. Would buy it again and give it as a gift.  The price was right and that is my story.
B0041KVW2K|2.0|I purchased six titles from 4 different vendors including Amazon.  I am shocked at the lack of quality control involved in manufacturing these records.  I do not recommend them if you want defect free vinyl.  I can live with the minor defects like rough or sharp edges and scuff marks.  I refuse to deal with off center pressings and deformed discs that impair playback.  Here is a list of my experience with the titles I purchased.  Its too bad because these are the best sounding recordings of the Beatles. If you want a box set buy the CDs.<br /><br />White Album - One disc was warped and sides 2 and 4 were pressed off center.  Returned due to defects.<br />Revolver - side 2 pressed off center and side 1 was perfect.  Returned due to defect.<br />Sgt Pepper - side 2 pressed off center and side 1 was perfect.  I kept it because the defect did not impair playback.<br />Magical Mystery Tour - side 2 pressed off center and side 1 was perfect.  I kept it because the defect did not impair playback.<br />Rubber Soul - side 2 pressed off center and side 1 was perfect.  I kept it because the defect did not impair playback.<br />Past Masters - no problems<br /><br />I would normally return a record that is pressed off center.  In this case I kept a few of them because to my ear the playback was not impaired and I would probably end up getting a copy much worse than what I already have.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Works as expected. Would buy it again and give it as a gift.  The price was right and that is my story.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I enjoy stories of animals which are based on fact, and found this film to be very entertaining and well done. I believe it was based on the true story of a Japanese gentleman who adopted an Akita, who waited faithfully at the train station for his master to return from work each day for many years after his death. A statue of Hachi was erected at the spot where he waited each day.
0790729725|5.0|Works as expected. Would buy it again and give it as a gift.  The price was right and that is my story.
B009P13RQY|3.0|The Sword move forward with their increasingly groove-driven sound on &#34;Apocryphon,&#34; showing that the grim and grit of earlier records like &#34;Age of Winters&#34; are in the hazy, pot-smoke cloud past, and the 1970s sci-fi vibe started on &#34;Warp Riders&#34; is the future. Lyrically the album reflects deep readings of Adam Warlock, &#34;Heavy Metal&#34; magazine and J.R.R. Tolkien with some Michael Moorecock thrown in, all mixed up in the haze of special herbs of course. The Sword inherit a stoner rock legacy forged by Sabbath, Candlemass, Fu Manchu and others, and by &#34;Apocryphon&#34; have made it their own. So for longtime fans this is a band that's refined its sound to a knife edge, and are beginning to own it and control it. The downside is there's not much here that &#34;Warp Riders&#34; didn't already cover. That doesn't make it a bad record though.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Works as expected. Would buy it again and give it as a gift.  The price was right and that is my story.
B004T6WHLG|3.0|Sacred Heart is a mixed bag that comes off a pretty strong run of studio and live albums (Plus an EP) from the original Dio lineup. This lineup is arguably the only one where it could be argued Dio was an actual band, and not just Ronnie James Dio's solo project. Hence &#34;Sacred Heart&#34; is the final statement of this lineup, and after churning out &#34;Holy Diver&#34; in 1983, barnstorming across the globe for years and following with &#34;The Last in Line,&#34; &#34;Sacred Heart&#34; shows some battle fatigue.<br /><br />For starters, &#34;King of Rock & Roll&#34; has a great riff to propel it, another opener in the vein of &#34;We Rock&#34; and &#34;Stand Up and Shout,&#34; but does nothing to progress the formula, and lyrically it's water-treading for Dio, who really phoned in the lyrics for this whole album. &#34;Another Lie&#34; stands out for its dearth of fantasy themes, a rarity for Dio material, but it still rates a &#34;just okay&#34; rating. &#34;Hungry for Heaven&#34; is borderline pop, and had it been redone by a late-80s pop group would've fit in on Top 40 radio with nobody noticing. The song which showed the most promise was &#34;Rock and Roll Children,&#34; an ode to runaways which could've been serviced by a stronger lyrical effort by Dio.<br /><br />Overall &#34;Sacred Heart's&#34; biggest problem is the strong over-reliance on Ronnie's favorite topics, such as dreamers, rainbows, evil women, and more dreams and dreaming. It takes the bite out of the band's attack, because musically Vivian Campbell does a good job on his last studio effort with the group, Vinnie Appice's thunderous and tight, and Jimmy Bain knew how to play bass the best with Dio's compositions. The darkness and mystique of the earlier records simply isn't here.<br /><br />Negatives aside, it's a must for Dio fans and completists, musically there isn't a weak performance on it, and when it hits the high spots, &#34;Sacred Heart&#34; still comes close to the earlier triumphs.
B002RI9ZQ8|4.0|Great book and really enjoyed part 2 and 3 before I read part 1.  Had to find out why?? Great writer, a shame there will be no more
B00122OULK|3.0|What's with Ronnie James Dio and his obsession with rainbows and dreaming? It's permeated nearly every song he's written, but by the late 1980s, it was getting very, very threadbare. After already milking hard on &#34;Sacred Heart,&#34; on &#34;Dream Evil&#34; Dio and Co. (Now into Mark II of the Dio lineup, featuring former Rough Cutt members Craig Goldy and Claude Schnelle) rub the poor cow raw. There's a definite difference in sound due to Goldy replacing Vivian Campbell, and in some ways Goldy's playing is bluesier (Particularly on &#34;Overlove.&#34;) and more relaxed compared to Campbell, who brought lots of adolescent piss and vinegar to his Dio recordings.<br /><br />The two singles off &#34;Dream Evil&#34; are overwrought ballads, and easy targets for Dio's critics. &#34;I Could've Been a Dreamer,&#34; is way more pop than it is metal, while &#34;All the Fools Sailed Away&#34; is aiming to be on some mid-80s romantic comedy of sorts. Having &#34;Night People&#34; or the title track might've helped this one sell some more units in its day.<br /><br />Like &#34;Sacred Heart&#34; before it, &#34;Dream Evil&#34; is more for diehard Dio fans than anything. It's certainly better than Dio's tired output that comes later.
B001R1PZ9M|5.0|It's what my grandson wants. He is into the TMNT right now so I try to get what he wants and Amazon usually has it.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I don't understand why this series is so popular. The story plods, Bale's portrayal of Batman is really sub-par, and, for such a cheesefest, this movie really acts much more important that it really is. I'd like to say save your money for a better movie but this is pretty standard fare now. Had the studio decided to leave Batman out of this movie and focus on the Robin and Catwoman characters, both of which are woefully neglected in this movie, this probably could have been an interesting movie.
B005LAII12|1.0|Ted(released June/12)stars Mark Wahlberg as John Bennett,with Seth McFarlane(Family Guy) doing the voice of stuffed bear Ted.On the surface this idea of a stuffed bear coming to life,would suggest a myriad of comic possibilities.Written,produced and executed with a deft and smart touch,this movie could have been a completely different and far BETTER film.Instead we are given a film populated with the kind of gutter crap that passes for humour these days and it constantly offends ones sensibilities throughout.This film is not a film for anyone under 18 years old but I personally know a father who has shown this to his young teenage boys,and I'm sure there are plenty more out there who think:\\"guy,talking teddy bear,oh how cute,let's all sit down and watch this\\".Believe me,keep this movie as far away from your children as possible.The stuffed bear utters language I would never use,has sex with various women,smokes up constantly and does other disgusting actions I just cannot say in this review.<br />The story starts with an eight year old John Bennett.He's a loner who wishes he had a companion.Voila,Ted comes to life and the two remain inseparable from that point on.John only keeps the secret so long and eventually Ted is introduced to various people and word spreads like wildfire.Ted becomes a celebrity.Fast forward and John is now 35 and he and his bear still co-habitate together.John has a girlfriend but their relationship is rocky at best,all centering around John's relationship with Ted.<br />In order to please his girlfriend he forces Ted out into his own place.Ted,trying NOT to,has gotten a job in a supermarket.This helps John and his girlfriends relationship for a time,but comes a party his girlfriend's boss throws.Ted phones John up saying their on-screen hero actor from the /80s Flash Gordon movie,Sam Jones,is actually there in his apartment.John reluctantly races over just to spend 30 minutes,but 30m turns into over two hours.His girlfriend hits the roof and finally leaves him.<br />At this time a slowly developing side plot enters the picture.A dysfunctional man and his son appear and kidnap Ted.Of course Ted puts out the SOS and John and his girlfriend come racing to the rescue.Ted is ripped apart in the struggle and loses his stuffing which eventually kills him.They race him home,put him together but nothing brings Ted back.Next morning Ted awakens to a startled John.It seems John's girlfriend wished her life back,which brought Ted back.The film ends as John gets married.<br />In cameo's,Ryan Reynolds appears as a gay lover,Norah Jones appears as someone Ted made love to some years back,and Tom Skerritt appears because one of the characters has kidnapped his daughter.Really twisted plot reasons to get good talent to make an appearance in ones movie.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.There are two versions here,a theatrical and an extended unrated version.The unrated is even raunchier than the theatrical version.Both are restricted anyways.Extras include a gag reel,a featurette and commentary.<br />All in all a totally disgusting film.This movie,put in the hands of someone who is smart and imaginative,could have made it so very much better than what we have here.Instead we have to settle for what passes for comedy these days,and get almost two hours worth of unfunny and mind numbing college frat humour.If you like continual four letter humour,then this buds for you.Mr.McFarlane, please stick to Family Guy,and leave real movie making to the professionals.finally leaves him.<br />At this time a slowly developing side plot enters the picture.A dysfunctional man and his son appear and kidnap

B0015DYIH2|5.0|It was amazing! I will recommend it to all my friends! It was an amazing turn out. I will definitely read it again.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Its just like the Weather Channel. Weather, news, updates, and a moving forecast just like on the Weather Channel television channel. Advanced app.
B000YHG72E|5.0|I was expecting it to be stupid, but it was hilarious! I'm glad I rented it. Very different story, not you typical Christmas movie.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is a great game. It really makes you use your brain. Logic, and intelligence are NEEDED for this game. There are several levels, and this is a good game for any age. The graphics are amazing, I just love it. There is no other game like it!
B008PUXMP2|5.0|The very best of the set is Back to Back, but the others are growing on me. What an amazing talent we have lost.
B005HSL626|3.0|I downloaded Fruit Ninja (free) because there was such a rave about it. I have played it for a while now, and I dont understand why there is such a rave over it, all you do is chop fruit that is tossed up into the air. It gets quite boring after the second round. There are also bombs that ruin your score, etc. Other that the bombs, there is nothing explosive about this game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Seriously, the best book of this whole series!<br /><br />I love children/teen series books, and found this one addictive, compelling, and a great depiction of what life would be like in this environment for all the parties involved.<br /><br />I highly recommend reading this.<br /><br />If you like this series, I would also recommend the Tunnels Series!  Also, brilliantly written
B0091REZMW|5.0|I LOVE this search and find. There are different levels, its hard to find the different items, and even though you will go into the same room a few times, there are always different things to find. Always something new. There are levels that are lit, done in the dark with just s scope of a flashlight, and there is a map where you can chose what room you go into. You DO NOT have to purchase coins/diamonds to continue playing, just wait a few hours and they will reload themselves... I dont understand the point of that, but whatever.. its a good game. And this is not a pay to play game like so many other reviewers said. All you have to do is wait for the energy to reload, and you can keep playing for free. Also, to get more diamonds for free all you have to do is level up in the game, and to do that just keep playing. Its 100% free, unless you WANT to pay for items that you can play for and get for free.<br /><br />UPDATE: Change her back to a brunette.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a good story.. It had me from the start.. But the ending needed more to it.. Yes they get together but that is it...
B0073RSVMC|5.0|paint is amazing. a bit smaller than expected but great quality, daughter loved it. would purchase again from this maker.
B005GYY0GA|5.0|I thought I would get something that was new from Johnny Winter and after reading the reviews decided to try Roots.  The cd contains a lot of songs that have been done from a lot of different artists so I was somewhat skeptical about what I was going to get.  Another rehash of a blues classic with a little twist by Johnny?  Something done differently that is detrimental to the song?  I can say, none of the above, what you get is Johnny Winter with his voice sounding stronger than ever and a cast of very fine musicians playing on this cd.  In fact you get some OUTSTANDING musicianship on this cd in my opinion.  If you're looking for a great blues album for your collection from one of our all time greats, get this one, you will not be dissapointed.
B001AGXEA6|5.0|My wife and I love this movie, we put it on every year for Halloween while we carve pumpkins!  All the actors are great, and its just a fun movie for all!
B0098460O4|5.0|These two young people are amazing!!  I love the cd and I just wish they had more cds that I could purchase.
B002RVCD6O|4.0|Amazing visualizations of the book content. Sound effects were superb, yet the highs/lows seemed out of whack - as such having to constantly adjust volume between normal dialogue and overwhelming special sound effects lessened the experience a bit.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|A good story. I like Grisham and read most of his books.This one was slow to start with a fast finish. I wish some of the end of the story could have been part of the beginning as a set-up for the last part of the story. The last few chapters were the best.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|What can you say?  It's a DVD; it's Castle first season; see how it all began; it's also Nathan Fillion.  Great.
1586217194|5.0|If you liked TIPPING POINT you will love Blink. I wish I could make this required reading in my university business ethic courses. It inspires people seeking  guidance in the classroom for management in all areas. It is a feel good book without the warm fuzzies.
B002MFX0RQ|3.0|I had a list of movies to watch about people with disabilities, and this was on the list.  I had never seen it before, but know it is considered a classic.  I did enjoy Jimmy Stewarts portrayal of a man who believed he had an invisible giant sized rabbit as his pal.  He was very good.  But the premise of the story is so unrealistic, at least in todays world.  I don't know how mental illness was treated in that era, but if people could be committed so easily, it was tragic, scary, and very sickening.  I didn't like the person who played his sister...she was whiny and just crazy herself...too much for me.  Again, this is a classic movie, but it is not my favorite.
0205632645|5.0|Celebrate its anniversary and buy yourself some style from the best! Your English instructors and others will love you. Your colleagues will admire you. Your students will emulate you.
B002CNOA6S|5.0|Dustin Hoffman plays a very convincing role as a man with autism.  And, Tom Cruise is always good.  I am taking a Special Education course and watching several movies regarding people with disabilities was required, and this movie was on the list.  I have seen it before, but am glad i had the opportunity to watch it again.  Highly recommended.
074350917X|5.0|Instructing and managing three departments has been known to be time consuming if not draining. K. Blanchard offers simple and easily attainable methods in improving performance while making those you lead feel even better about themselves. Happy people who feel good about their work and achievements  want to achieve even more. It feels good not to dread reprimands. It feels great to have an easily execution-able action plan. It feels wonderful having structured positive encounters that create time in the day.
B000ID37RM|5.0|I am 52 years old and have never seen this movie.  I am sure glad I finally watched it.  It is a great movie about prejudice, good and evil, and about how people with disabilities have been treated.  I highly recommend the move for those who have not seen it, and for those who have...watch it again!
B007UWBQEU|5.0|The power and range of emotion in this song was a amazing. Carrie knows to take a song and make it her own.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|One of DeMille's best.  I could not put the book down until I was finished reading it.  It did have a few spots where it was overplayed but on the whole an excellent book.

B007HACDLK|5.0|I love Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp series and hope he's doing well. The Last Man left the door open for more Mitch Rapp.
1419707663|4.0|My grandson has read some of these books and he loves them.They are perfect for young kids to read,the stories are fun and he can read them to his younger brother.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|As always the perfect murder never exist, but it's fun to watch the twist and turns. The successful family is all in play, the loving wife with the busy job. The husband who never there or is he. The niece - daughter who happens to be the computer geek and gay, who's fantastic skills saves the day. Oh let's not forget the uncle, who is an over aged cop with issues of his own.<br />Add a layer of supporting characters and a good murder, gives you a great book that's hard to put down.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Breath of fresh air! Fun ajd addictive. Minor dislikes  involving daily gold gift outs and not being ahle to discard eggs you dont want. But  still enjoyable.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|This is a great collection of whitney Houston's work.  I wish it was bigger with more of her later works such as &#34;million dollar bill&#34;
B003Z0D4S2|1.0|Whereas I enjoyed the other two books preceding, I found this very dull.  There is so much detail about who works where and who is who that I found myself nodding off.  I do not plan to finish this book.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Heart touching book I loved every single word of it. It was so good I even read it again. Awesome.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Another great release by G5! Excellent graphics storyline etc. 5 stars as always! Can't wait for the next one. Well worth the download.
B00008O89K|5.0|The reviewer of 1/9/2005 gives perhaps the best possible summary of this disc, certainly in terms of comparing this release with the Varese Sarabande edition, which has more than a quarter hour of additional music. In any case, this one has pretty much what I consider the best core material: Anvil of Crom, Wheel of Pain, Theology/Civilization and The Orgy. While certainly the Varese edition is preferable if you can get it at a reasonable price, this one should be snatched up in its absence. Rarely has a fantasy film and its score been so perfectly matched -- Poledouris' themes exquisitely match the setting, tone and action of the movie, but also are able to stand -- and get around -- on their own. Highly  recommended
B002S8AGZG|5.0|Loved this movie and now that it's on blu-ray is even better I would definitely recommend this movie to my friends just loved it very funny.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|A must see if your into once apon a time show but be careful the queen shreak's a little loud!

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read every book John Grisham has written.  His plots are suspenseful and the endings surprising.  If you haven't read a Grisham, try it -- you will enjoy his page-turning style.
B0058N2T3K|5.0|Finally I have been waiting to get the series on blu-ray this series is really my favorite and I would definitely recommend this movie to all my friends
0714834491|5.0|totally off-beat and eclectic - - & taken a page or two per day - - this book will stimulate your mind daily for a year or two.
B002NXSRX4|5.0|I really loved this movie very entertaining and very funny too I would definitely recommend this movie to all my friends just loved it.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I came across Mike's book recently and I was curious to know what was so great about a book that was released a few months ago, yet in a very short period of time, it has received TONS of positive reviews so I thought I'd give it a try but I wasn't expecting much. This book blew out my expectations and surprisingly I got more out of the book than I expected. This concise book (less than 200 pages) is just clear, straight to the point and just sticks to the underlying basic principles, which makes it an excellent guide for training and nutrition. The book simply skips all the BS you normally read in magazines and over the internet that are normally filled with trash , which often bore you with endless drivel and wrong information about exercise and nutrition.<br /><br />Mike covers the main aspects on strength training, cardio, nutrition and supplements. He is sticking to the basics that will earn you results, instead of all the gimmicks that get you nowhere. He also lays out a proper yet demanding workout plan (no one said it's going to be easy,right?) aided by some useful tips on nutrition (essential ingredient that you must take seriously). You'll have to put a lot of effort into it and dedicate an hour a day for exercising, but if you stick to it you'll see some major changes. Just commit to it and be patient. In 8 weeks, I lost 10 kg by combining weight training and cardio and sticking to healthy food (most of the time). I am down to 200 lbs now, reduced my body fat by ~10% and I'm gaining some lean muscle. I'll try to post updates on my progress over the next few months.<br /><br />Mike also provides a year's worth workout plan in his bonus report, which is quite useful when combined with his book. The best part is that if you have any questions or if you're confused about something, just shoot him an e-mail and he'll get back to you very quickly with a detailed reply.<br /><br />In short, this book takes a straight non-BS approach to training for those who areserious and willing to commit to it. Do yourself a favor and buy this book!
B0058ZPMYG|5.0|This movie was great when I first watched it I just loved it and I would definitely recommend this to my friends to watch very cool.
B0072OFM28|3.0|LOVED the hell out of \\"Blood and Sand\\" and \\"Gods of the Arena\\".  But the second season of the Spartacus saga (or unofficial THIRD season, depending how you look at it), called \\"Vengeance,\\" well, not so much.  This season, the bad outweighs the good.<br /><br />1) Liam Mcintyre, the actor picked as the \\"replacement\\" Spartacus, pales in comparison to the original Spartacus played by the wonderful Andy Whitfield.  Liam has none of the charisma, presence, personality, physical prowess or acting skills that Andy had.  And consequently, the character Spartacus is now a total bore to watch.<br /><br />2) Worse yet in the actor department, the wonderful actress Lesley-Ann Brandt (who played the character Naevia in \\"Blood\\" and \\"Gods\\") left the show and was replaced by the horrendously awful actress Cynthia Addai-Robinson.  Whenever Cynthia Addai-Robinson is on-screen the show is unwatchable.  Her acting is cringeworthy and she seems so out-of-place in comparison to every other actor on the show.  The producers of the show just could not have cast a worse actress to replace Lesley-Ann Brandt as Naevia.<br /><br />3) The action \\"style\\" of the show has gotten WORSE.  Instead of toning down the stupid \\"300\\" style action scenes, in this season the producers dramatically increased the irritating super slow-motion action and ridiculous looking gushing geysers of fake looking blood.  At this point the show might as well just become a cartoon or video game, because the action is just that goofy looking.  There's just ZERO imagination or creativity going into the fights and violence of this show now.<br /><br />4) The writing was very weak this season.  Seems like the writers really struggled this time out to come up with decent story lines, and the stories they did come up with mostly felt either rushed, underdeveloped, overcooked or nonsensical.  For example, the Seppius and Seppia characters seemed like great new additions to the show, but both were killed off, making their additions to the show seemingly pointless.  Likewise, the storyline involving hot new blonde Chadara went NOWHERE (again she was killed off before her story could develop).  And Lucy Lawless' character Lucretia really felt like she had little place in the season; her character turned into a mess and really served no purpose.  Also, Spartacus's tiny \\"army\\" of rebellious slaves started off strong, planning attacks and pulling off miraculous rescues of other slaves, but then mid-season they just sort of bog down at a temple and just sort of sit there waiting to get attacked for a very long period.  It became boring.<br /><br />5) The expected \\"love story\\" between Spartacus and Mira also seemed to be a non-starter.  It never developed into anything close to a love story, and then, spoiler alert, Mira dies, killing of any chance of a love story to bloom in the next (last) season.  Similarly, the relationship between Crixus and Naevia went nowhere.  The roller coaster relationship between Ilithyia and Glaber was the best \\"relationship\\" in the season, especially earlier on when Ilithyia was trying to leave Glaber.<br /><br />Overall, a huge disappointment.  But then the standards set were SO high.  \\"Blood and Sand\\" and \\"Gods of the Arena\\" are just so awesome.  It's hard for any show to maintain that level of greatness.
B006PYHYXG|5.0|If you are looking at this you are ready know the quality of Ergotrons products. Most people will not need this, what comes with the mount is more then enough. I use three monitors in a corner tight against the wall, and fount that is it almost impossible to adjust the two side monitors left and right with keeping them as close to the wall as possible. I added one of these to each bracket and it gave me that extra degree of movement so I was able to keep the monitors tight to the wall and inline with each other. A little costly, but will last forever, well worth the money.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|I enjoyed the film and it's take on a legendary bootlegging family.  Tom Hardy is fantastic in his role as leader.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|I really enjoyed the ending to this series. Very entertaining and ending was a surprise since I did not finish reading books.
B009VB9VKY|2.0|Not worth the money we spent. Wait until you can watch it for free. Acting was almost non-existent. Cannot recommend.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|These books are very good. They are easy reading, which I personally need. I don't like too much history as it bores me. The author is very vivid and graphic without being gory. I like these books.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Loved the book AND the movie.  Wish I would have read the book before, as it adds some nice asides to what happened on the screen.  Doesn't matter.  Well worth the read!

B003CSV7TK|4.0|I love this movie it's a perenial fav.... the movie quality itself on the authentic black and white version was a bit &#34;iffy&#34;. But all in all a fine movie.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|to be honest I have to say the theater version is by far better than the enhanced version,becuse ths computer graphics just don't look as real like in the orginial version.I think its simplisicty was its charm.some of the scenes such as entering the space port it showed the audience more and bens home the sapce battle at the end sort of wrecked its simplisicty with the extra footage they should have stuck with the orginial.I hope my views don't offend anybody
B007HACDLK|5.0|Loved it. Vince Flynn continues to impress. Reads well and is non stop action.  Can't wait to see what Mitch will do next
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Its like, lets get a book out for people to buy for the holidays, they will buy it because their friends like Grisham. Not his best.
B0015AARJI|3.0|X button was kinda stiff. Other than that the control gets the job done. Been using it for about 3 weeks now.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Did not watch first two episodes. I had a preconceived idea I would not care for the scenario of a female Dr. Watson. Watched episode 3 while visiting with the children. That night I signed up for the series to be delivered to my library on Amazon. AND Lucy's Watson rocks.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Felt all the emotions that the book had to offer its a little over whelming at times but a great book none the less.
B001HN6918|5.0|Kung Fu Panda 2, by name alone, may sound like a childish, uninspired film. Not at all. It's a very sweet film that has a lot of love and care put into the detail -- the character development, the animation, and the well-written script. It's a kid's film, but anyone can enjoy it.<br /><br />Despite an A-lister cast (Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, etc.) the film blessedly never lampshades the actors. Gary Oldman is especially awesome as the sinister peacock Shen. Yes, a peacock, and he's an excellent villain.<br /><br />Kung Fu Panda 2 is a great film, and definitely underrated by the Pixar-dominated market.
B009JBZH54|5.0|We are huge dark knight fans and I had to buy this for my husband for Xmas the box set is great the box is awesome and comes with a booklet of pics which is really cool gave it to my husband early because I was dying to watch them couldn't be happier and great price

B0063IYR4I|5.0|I have tried 3 breathing/meditation apps, and this is by far the best so far.  You can use sound and/or visual cues to pace your breathing.  A progression of levels from beginner to advanced.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|As entertaining and suspenseful as all the previous books in the series...I highly recommend it to anyone who's read the series. And if you haven't, go back to the beginning and do, they're great books!
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|This movie was so so. They tried to hard to one up the Dark Knight. Too much info, slow action to develop.<br />I still enjoyed it but I liked the Dark Knight better.<br />This was my first purchase on Amazon Video and it was AWFUL!!<br />I purchased the HD version and it kept buffering saying my connection was too slow (Not the case because I have a 18 mbs connection). Netflix and Hulu work fine on my PS3 so I am blaming it on Amazon.<br />The quality of the movie was downgraded and it was still buffering. I watched the movie in standard definition and clinking the continue button every 2 mns.<br />I will be buying my on line streams somewhere else until this is fixed.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Am I the only one in the world who is sick and tired of these 'fans' of movies stating how much they hate the<br />basic premises of good and bad films?  How much they would have liked something more if it had gone this way or that?<br />If a movie had shown this, the actors done that, or the plot developed to this end?  Double-you-tee-eff!!!  Yeah, that's right, I typed it out.<br />Wouldn't want anyone to get 'confused' now, like a few who couldn't follow this story and are now backlashing online.<br />Who in the world cares what you wanted something to be, what about what it already is?  If I have to see or hear your opinion, make it something<br />worthwhile and informative.  'This is a waste of money' does not cut it.  My absolute favorite was the guy sitting behind us the second time we<br />went to see it at the theater standing up at the end and saying, \\"That's it?\\"  In the words of Monday Night Football analysts, \\"Come on man!!!\\"<br />I hope I speak for a majority of the real fans of movies out there when I say, \\"Who Cares, Dude!!!\\"  I don't care about YOUR expectations, I don't<br />care about how badly YOU THINK the actors did their part.  Most people's opinions are useless and uninformative at best, even those who get paid<br />for theirs.  Please don't waste my time, any other fan's time, or Amazon's type space to tell us who or what you've 'LIKED' on facebook as far as<br />movies and actors/directors.  This is not facebook.  Go back and check out the 'Was This Review Helpful' section of your drivel and witness firsthand<br />the disparaging ratio of 'yes' to 'no' if you don't believe me.<br /><br />And why were people reviewing the movie on here before the DVD was released?  Again, WHO CARES?!  And if I have to see one \\"more\\" unpunctuated<br />or, overly punctuated sentence,., one more mistspeled <- word, or one mor gramatuecal arrors, I'm gonna P-U-K-E!!!!  Why should we listen to your<br />suggestions on improving the film when you didn't take the time to improve your review?<br />People, if you see things like this, disregard everything in the rest of the so called review.  Oh, and about those who miss Sigourney, there is<br />a group of fans out there who cheered when Ripley died in Alien3, so I don't want to hear it and neither do the rest of us.<br /><br />I'll step down off of my own soapbox now.<br /><br />The fact is, this is a great movie, one of the best of the year, and one of the best sci-fi movies ever.  The quality is high in all aspects,<br />don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  The production is great, the cinematography is excellent (of course), and the acting is great for this movie.<br />Oh, and guess what, the CG effects don't ruin the movie like almost all of the other sci-fi films of recent memory.  Nobody's going to win any<br />awards for their performance, but the crowd who watches these pictures doesn't give a hoot.  The Academy usually rewards<br />over-actors anyway.  Thankfully, you won't find any of them in this film.  These things being said, if you need anyone to tell you their opinion<br />of Ridley Scott's return to sci-fi filmmaking before you see it for yourself, you have no business watching it in the first place.<br /><br />The only bad thing about the whole experience is that the movie actually asks more questions than it answers, which will most likely be mended<br />with subsequent sequels, the limits of which are unfathomable at this point.  They've set themselves up to do even more great things with a separate, yet<br />interconnected, series with this film.  If they continue on the path the ending suggests, we could have an epic, and I mean EPIC series!!!  Yeah,<br />the story doesn't explain all of itself in this one sitting, but praise to the filmmakers and writers for not making this an episode of Law and Order,<br />so cut-and-dried from start to finish.  THANK YOU!<br /><br />The DVD is paltry, most are nowadays, with only deleted scenes (the best special feature of any movie anyway).  The menu is designed well and is<br />themed around the visuals of the film.  The only thing is, if you've seen all of the trailers and TV spots, you'll notice that not all of the<br />deleted/alternate scenes are here.  I'm with some of the others in hoping for a Director's Cut in the future, just for fun.  I don't think the<br />film itself needs it, I just remembered and waited for a lot of the scenes in the TV spots to happen and they didn't.  Buy it, rent it, see it however<br />you wish, but SEE IT!  Don't miss out because of some other 'fan'.  This film is deeper than a lot of people will understand and the questions asked<br />and answered are bigger than most sci-fi movies have ever bothered to conceive.  As a firm believer in God, I can still get enjoyment out of the<br />alien-creation stuff because, hey, it is SCIENCE FICTION, and even knowing the real truth for myself, the premise of the movie is still fun and very cool.<br /><br />P.S. The only other thing that sucks is every cover for this movie.  There was so much more iconic imagery that could have been used.  Again...Director's Cut?
B003L77FYS|5.0|I love this show so much. I just bought all of the seasons on DVD & I will be spending my winter break watching all 4 seasons! CASKETT FTW :D
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I like John Grisham because his books are exciting to read.  He is a bit wordy and it is sometimes difficult to follow the story's theme, but makes you more curious about the final outcome.  I would recommend &#34;The Racketeer&#34;.
B005723JSQ|4.0|I am weird. I loved all of Kinsella's books except the Shopaholic series. This one was great! More along the lines of Can You Keep a Secret? Definitely worth reading.
B008M0UTRO|5.0|All I can say is that From Up on Poppy Hill is definitely Goro's best film. Why? Because his DAD is helping him with this film!<br />Now that is a classic! This is a Miyazaki Film! The art is beautiful. The characters are amazing. I know the English dub is coming at March 2013, but i will give it a shot. I highly recommend this for all audiences. And like I said, from Tales of EarthSea to From Up on Poppy Hill...Goro is forgiven!
B002RSDW80|5.0|Another big hit. The story of both women was inspiring. I got very hungry watching it but still just loved it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm looking forward to more.  The characters are well thought out and easy to relate to.  The book has a nice easy tempo and moves along at just the right pace.  Even when switching back and forth between plots in the last book the chapters were spaced just right.  You were ready to hear more about the  parallel plot just as you got to the end of the chapter and switched plots again.  Very well done and a terrific bargain.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This book was a good, fast read as I found myself unable to put it down and wanting more. I know this is a subjective comment as only the author knows what he experienced, but as a Christian - I found it very disturbing that there is no presence of \\"Jesus\\" in Dr. Alexanders accounts of passing through the levels of heaven. Wouldn't we hope to have met Jesus himself and be in front of God for our judgement before crossing through the levels of heaven as Dr. Alexander claims? Isn't that the whole point of the \\"only way to heaven is through Jesus\\"? While the story is titillating and engaging, as a believer in Christ, its missing the main ingredient. Where's Christ? Makes one wonder...
030758836X|4.0|Gone Girl is extremely well written with plot twists galore. The tale is a bit disturbing in that it says so much about how some people behave. Kudos to Giliian Flynn for a great book.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|This book lives up to the promise of the prequel, The Governess Affair. I found it absorbing and a little maddening, but good enough to lose sleep to.<br /><br />I found the handling of Robert's crusading excellent. He has all the right intentions, but because of his enormous privilege, he sometimes screwed it up. He forgot to consider other people's feelings. He came from a position of power, and it made him make mistakes. I sort of love that his entire character development was pretty much privilege-checking and apologizing. And his family loves and teases him about both parts.<br />\\"Sebastian grinned. \\"On the eve of your wedding, Robert, we shall offer you the sorts of female delights that you have always lusted after. Philosophical tracts upon philosophical tracts, all of them advocating political change that would result in an upheaval of the current social order. We shall set forth their essays, and then...\\" He paused, as if for dramatic emphasis. \\"Then, my friends, we shall argue about them!\\"\\"<br /><br />On the other hand, Minnie has a secret past. An atypical secret past. If you like cloak-and-dagger Napoleonic spy stories, you might enjoy this. She has lived her entire adult life trying her very hardest to blend in, to fly under the radar, to not make waves. That doesn't mean she's not blazingly smart. And Robert loves her for that. Also, he thinks of her with really STRONG analogies. It's so refreshing to realize he's thrilled to find a woman who can outmatch him. I want people to think of me as a great powerful beast just pretending to be good!<br />\\"He had that sense again, of a great beast pacing in its cage. He wanted to touch her cheek, to turn her face up to his. He wanted to whisper that all would be well.\\"<br /><br />\\"\\"Physiological fact,\\" His Grace said. \\"Arousal makes me stupid. It makes me say idiotic things like `I like your tits' and, `Help, we've had a paste emergency over here.' It makes me want to stay around you even though I know I'm overmatched, even though I'm sure you're going to win.\\" His voice lowered. \\"You see, I want to watch you do it.\\"\\"<br /><br />(swoon)<br /><br />Of course, this is a Milan book, so at least one person has to have psychological damage (I actually like this feature, but it seems good to warn people.) Minnie is terrified of crowds. Robert had a hellish childhood of rejection. And Robert's mother has Issues. None of these things is actually solved in this book, just... ameliorated by love and behaving like adults.<br /><br />I liked that it was work for these people to get together, even though they had feelings for each other. Feelings don't operate in a vacuum, and I like a story that shows that.<br /><br />Be aware that this is more Victorian than Regency, so there are trains and industrialization and stuff like that, and the role of women is slightly less constrained. Also, can one assert there is a Boston marriage in industrial England? Because there so is, and I love it.<br />\\"And when they failed to find men that they loved after a handful of Seasons, they had refused to marry for convenience. Instead, they'd retired together to the small farm that Caro owned just outside of Leicester--friends and spinsters for the remainder of their lives. They were as close as sisters. Closer, Minnie suspected.\\"<br /><br />I am really looking forward to the Christmas-themed book in this series, which should be out annnnnytime in the next couple days.<br /><br />Read if: You have enjoyed other Courtney Milan books.

B0013TPV0Q|5.0|Sedaris is brilliant.  Just as amusing as his Christmas story.  I am going to recommend this book to everyone I know.  He writes about ordinary things but his commentary is extraordinary.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Taleb might be a little didactic.  And sometimes hokey. Yet, he delivers a  provoking thesis and in the world of herd mentality it should serve as a signal amongst the noise...good complement with Nate Silver's book.
0547569653|4.0|This is a great book about running, food as fuel, and strength of mind and spirit. I would recommend to runners and non runners alike.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|if this is your cup of tea -- it's an masterfully brewed one.  Pure enjoyment -- the classiest of soap operas with characters you love, and love to loathe.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I  have Evernote on my Android phone, PC and Kindle HD. It is very easy to understand and very user friendly.
B004J7D3TK|4.0|am impressed with how mark zuckerberg had such a vision that translated into billions. these young people are born with such gifts. wisdom from the mouth of babes.
B0038P59A0|5.0|It was just an awesome movie! And I like the fact that I didn't have to go to a movie rental place or redbox to get it.
B002RWKSII|5.0|I love the original brian Wilson music but his harmonies are so beautiful with Gershwin. Wilson is my favorite artist.
B000FCKC4C|2.0|Needs more twists and a more interesting plot that keeps the reader engaged. But it was not terrible but on the other hand it wasnt good either
B007U1FEJE|5.0|brian Wilson is a genius and is my favorite songwriter. I have danced to his music since I was a teen and I am uplifted by his harmonies and spiritual beauty. too bad he had such a tortured youth.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|i played this on my kindle fire.  loved it. will play it again and will watch for this developer in the future
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I have all her 4 albums and loved them all. her voice is angelic and proves that god can bless you no matter how old you are. am so grateful she is now a world known talent. about time.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I stopped playing this game once ownership transferred due to all the annoying ads. It really killed the fun for me.
B0002ZMITY|1.0|it was pornographic. didn't expect it. thought it would be more witty but it was crass and vulgar. a disappointment.
B004SN8Z5M|5.0|For the price they are posting for the blue shoes, it can not be beat. I've been wearing semi-barefoot and barefoot running shoes for the past year including the reebok realflex and the vivobarefoot running shoes. I've been looking at the merrell trail gloves for quite some time, but they were too expensive at the time. When I saw that these were on sale I snatched up a pair immediately. These are light and seem to give adequate protection at the bottom. However, since these are almost identical to the trail gloves, which are made to be used on trails, you lose more \\"feel\\" than the vivobarefoot. Also, the realflex seems to be more flexible than the sonic gloves. However, the quality of this shoe is top notch and seems better than the other two. I also like how this shoe keeps debris out of the shoe, unlike the vivobarefoot. I'll continue to rotate the shoes and see which one I like best for everyday wear/running/lifting.<br /><br />Update:<br />For those that worry about the aesthetics of the shoe: I bought the black gradient one. The back seems to be black and transitions to a hue of blue near the toe area. I know a lot of runners prefer the flashy shoes, however, I like mine more low key. I would have preferred the shoes to be one tone, the material with the black gradient on it would look better all black, dark grey, or white. Just my opinion. The shoes itself are still great.
B006OAB3ME|4.0|another gem from a prolific artist. how can one be so productive all these years. amazing. a truly gifted artist.
B002CW4K7S|2.0|This is an outstanding record, and this reissue in particular is an excellent remastering/packaging of the original pressing.<br /><br />My complaints are not about the product, but about Amazon's listing of it.  At least two details are incorrect: (1) It does NOT include \\"a coupon for MP3 download of the album\\" as outlined in Amazon's editorial review, and (2) it does NOT include the tracks \\"Blue Monday\\" nor \\"The Beach\\" as outlined on Amazon's track listing (as it's a reissue of the original pressing, not the later American CD/cassette releases which included them).<br /><br />These are both very important distinctions to someone considering purchase, and though it might not be intentional, from the perspective of a customer it appears as a bait-and-switch type of deception that Amazon suggest their inclusion.  These kinds of lazy research errors seem all too common with Amazon listings, and are nothing short of criminal.<br /><br />Get it together Amazon.
B000002LCU|5.0|brilliant. great hearing his works again. some people are born with special gifts. I am uplifted by his music. such a talent.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|Love it, no problems at all, product is exactly as explained by the sellers with the exact final result mentioned.
B0012EM5D8|5.0|so easy watching movies from home. Seinfeld is so funny. great movie. good for kids. original thinking. must be nice to have such talent.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|oh my gosh I love this game and I'm thirteen! I bought it for my little sister but I love it too!
B000SSV8HI|5.0|loved the energy and music of the stones. was so inspired that even though I am as old as they are, they still rock therefore so can I. what a bargain purchase this was.
030716327X|5.0|It was everything I hoped it would be, and the the ship time was decent. This a good book  for curious kids.
B002QGSYRC|2.0|It is well written i.e. easy to read and that is about all I liked about it. However, I found the spin the author presents false, specifically:<br />-  the Korean war was partially a result of the Truman administration support for Chiang which was due to the China lobby pressure. If we only recognized Mao communists early and worked with them there would be no conflict. I saw similar reasoning in the communist propaganda back in the 50ies so David Halberstam is not original.<br />- Dean Acheson presented as the saviour of the American Army who fought valiantly for increased military budget and capability<br />- the US administration \\"communist infiltration\\" scare is presented as the Republican invention to end their electoral defeats. I think when the book was written most of Venona material was declasified so the \\"scare\\" was not invented.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer that it is a book about \\"how MacArthur contributed to the Korean war and then lost it\\". I felt the author bias is very strong, e.g. there is a whole chapter on defending small piece of frontline in the Pusan perimeter and then only 2-3 pages about the Inchon landing.<br /><br />Overall, I would not recommend the book and since I bought it based on its Pulitzer prize award I will now treat Pulitzer awards for history reporting with \\"measured caution\\".
B008LY9AWG|4.0|Good reads, but not exactly classicd Connelly. Thought there would be more to it when I finished. Again, good read.
B00026WU9Q|5.0|There are no limits with Bob Dylan.  He sings about it all....God....the jews....the rest of the world...the good, the bad and the ugly....the innocent the weak...the rich, the poor....every one in every walk of life.....he's in a class all of his own and will go down in history as one of the most celebrated and appreciated artists of our time.<br />Milly, Mississauga, ON Canada.
030758836X|2.0|This book grabbed me immediately and I anticipated a psychological thriller. Then ridiculous contrivances ensued and the discovery that all the main characters were so vile that there was no one to root for. Depressing, sickening ending. I wanted to scrub every word out of my head when I reached the abrupt conclusion.
B0009MAP9A|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy all of Bob's songs.  He's one of the most prolific writers and singers of all times.  There is so much wisdom and forsight in his words.  Working on collecting more of his music.<br />Milly, Mississauga, ON, Canada
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I think that everyone should play this game. I am so obsessed with it!!! Everyone should download it. It should be illegal to not play this game!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book completely cuts through the BS that exists inside of the training world. Its a great guide for complete novices, or for people who have been overtraining their whole lives. Mike does a great job stripping out the BS and giving you simple/ proven core concepts that are backed up with research and ultimately results. He does not lie to you about magic methods/ products. He gives you a diet and a workout regiment that will end in great results. Now its up to you to do it, thats the true secret. Its a great book for all levels of training, guarantee you learn something new.
B007704HO6|5.0|Love this book! This story will draw you in! Heard about this book from my sister, and glad I decided to buy it! I would stay up quite late a night because I couldn't put the book down. You won't regret reading this story!
B006903GX8|3.0|I love this series and was excited to read more about the show and the history of the period and characters portrayed. I found the content very informative.<br /><br />I purchased the kindle version and later found at least one of the photos wasn't in the kindle version. I think the ebook versions should be clearly described if there are edits and omitted text or omitted photos that are in the print versions. Ideally technology should adapt pictorial works in full glory for ebook versions or the publisher should abstain from selling an ebook without full disclosure.<br /><br />I will think twice before purchasing any ebook version of an illustrated book. I do wish Amazon would disclose any variations between the print and kindle versions.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Super fun yet addicting game . Keep a eye on your clock or you will stay up all night playing
B006LSZECO|4.0|I couldn't put it down! Very intriguing storyline! Great book for book clubs!<br />It's a good book for traveling and sitting on the beach!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My kids and grandkids all love anything Angry Birds. Great blend of Star Wars & Angry Birds. It's highly addictive and fun.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|It was a very good read! Loved learning so much about flowers and their meaning along with an inspirational story! Gave me new insight into foster care!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love the series and I way love the book it's detailed and will always give you somethin a movie will not wish there was more to the series than jus three books sad face to that. Will read again and again
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This is one of the quirkiest  most delightful movies I've ever seen.  I heard a review that put it well - it's about a lot of dysfunctional adults who come together for the sake of the kids.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I find this game confusing and there are few guidelines on how to play.I very Much prefer regular Angry Birds
B004D1CK32|1.0|Toshiro Mifune gobbles up the screen.  His presence saved this movie for me.  There was too much 'drama' in this movie. It took me a really long time to get invested in the characters. I found it simplistic (although that was intentional). The other thing I enjoyed was seeing the countryside.  I know it's a classic but it's too long for me. It takes too long to get the samurai and bring them back, and then too long getting ready for the attack. So shoot me.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great time killer. good for a short distraction when having to wait for something or when winding down before bed
B008XG1X18|5.0|Now my crack-pinterest addiction can go with me anywhere I go.  Oh how this product is not only perfect for filling boring spots in my schedule (or making me procrastinate what I should be doing), it also gives me so many great ideas & tools that I can look up at a moments notice.<br /><br />P.S. I have been known to hide under the sheets at night when I can't sleep and surf this app when my husband is sound asleep!
B005IQ39AY|3.0|Deactivate vibrate ... Please? Apparently I need to use more words to get this simple point across to amazon. I don't like my phone vibrating when I play the game...
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Surprisingly a really good movie.  My husband even liked it and Theron was outstanding in it, along with Stewart who I have never cared a whole lot for.  This movie changed my mind.
0545265355|5.0|I wasn't aware of the Hunger Games Trilogy until my younger sister told me about it a few months before the movie was released. I decided to catch up on what everyone was talking about and the boxed set was the easiest way of doing that.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Who doesn't love this movie.  I downloaded it for my nieces and nephews to keep entertained when needed, but I think I watch it more.  Good, clean, cute, & funny.
0439023513|5.0|Love Hunger Games!  These books are awesome and I cannot recommend them enough.  While some think that this third book is a let down, after reading it I realized it was the perfect ending.
B0086700CM|2.0|My kids wanted this game after hearing friends talk about it.  So we got it for free to try it out.  It's OK.  Graphics are not that clear.  Game is very similar to Subway Surfers, which has more options and much better graphics.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|ok I don't understand a lot of you people says your kindly fire crashed well mine didn't why do y'all put stupid stuff when y'all haven't even played it
B00A757EFW|4.0|i think that this game is a classic i used 2 play it on my nintendo 64 but the controls could use  work but awesome game
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|The product was shipped promptly and it is really with the limited edition count (xxxxxx/xxxxxx). Very happy with the product. You should grab one while they still have it.
B007ELN8Y8|1.0|Couldn't wait for this film to get over.  It was a boring movie trying to bring some kind of artistic value by making it in black and white.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|We really enjoy watching this video with our kids.  It is a great story told from a mother's perspective to calm her children's fears.  It's not too long and contained nothing offensive.  Simply delightful.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Really enjoyed this.  Didn't have high expectations that MIB could pull it off another time but they did a very good job.
B005LAIHHC|3.0|I went to see it to the teathers and I found it really bad, I mean, in a scale of 10 11 but it was peeing-in-your-pants funny, literally I went to the bathroom inn the cinemas because of the fun.<br />I still haven't got my Blu-Ray but whenever I get it I will review the quality
0374533571|5.0|My daughter has seen this movie 3 times and this will be one of her best Christmas presents since undoubtably she will by the DVD when it comes out.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I bought this because my husband asked me too so our family could watch it together, it has a very good message.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|well written with stories weaving in and out.  Gave the reader a lot to think about life, dealing with aging and relationships.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|For my husband and he loves it,he is a angry birds fanatic.he never stops playing in the evening after he gets home from work.
B004YRSBTW|4.0|Very interesting,keeps your interest.Liked the actors also.The word requirements on these reviews are ridiculous, You shouldnt have to write your life history to give your rating!!!
034580404X|4.0|If you liked the Twilight series you'll love this trilogy.  It is extremely well written with character depth and a great plot.  The plot gets a little cheeky in the second two books.  There is sooo much going on you wonder how any person can stay sane through all of that. However, despite its heavy drama this is an exceptional series.
030758836X|1.0|I was super excited to read this book. About 100 pages in I wondered if I should keep reading or not- it felt like it might be a novel akin to fast food- you can't resist it, but after you're done you feel a bit sick. This book was a complete and total waste of time and the ending...sick. I can't believe I wasted my time reading this. I'm all for a good dark mystery/thriller, but she truly does not deliver this. And, given the ending, the author strikes me as very self-satisfied with herself- \\"look how clever I am!\\" Please. Don't waste your time on this book.
B000JQXZ2U|5.0|My children owned this book when they were young and loved it.  My daughter bought this one for her great-nephew, my great-grandson.  It is a wonderful starter book for children who like to draw.  His figures are easy to complete and give the child a warm feeling of accomplishment.  I would suggest this for any young artist frustrated that his horse looks like a cow.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I mainly game and do some renders, but this cpu runs fairly cool with the stock cooler. I love to multitask and have had no problems doing so, the cpu never goes past 55% load except when stress testing.
B0054JELS4|4.0|This is a Christmas gift, but my husband enjoys the show on TV, so I know that he will enjoy watching the DVD set.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this book. This book, written by R. J. Palacio, provides insight about what it's like to live in a society that looks down at and is scared of those with physical deformities. The book is about a 10 year old boy named August, who is born with a severe facial deformity, and how he copes with his appearance. The book covers his perspective as well as those close to him. This is a must read as it provides insight and emotion about a true hero.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It just keeps getting better and better. I cannot wait for February. I hope I get the comic book for Christmas.
B0036BK6MW|4.0|This movie is very good. There are a lot of nice developed characters and a really nice story of redemption. The reason why I am not giving it a 5 star it's because there are some unclear things in the movie. Like we never really figured out what happened to Oher and his brother and why were they separated. Oher's past has not being explored enough. Also, the character interpreted by Sandra Bullock's husband is little too submissive, which he is not in real life. It is made for the purpose of making Bullock really dominant force in the family, pulling decisions in adopting Mike etc.. However, the movie portrayed her husband little bit like a pansy and not like the man in the house. Also, as I Christian I don't like american football because it is too violent and I don't like Christians cursing and stuff which happens in the movie on couple of occasion (b word). Also Christians should not revenge and retaliate which Sandra Bullock does all the time. But overall, this movie has a good lesson. I enjoyed the interview with Tuey's and Papadopulous on internet after I watched the movie. These people are really great in real life.
B008A1NSTG|4.0|Fun family movie.  Uplifting and perfect for family movie night.  I don't think I'd purchase to own it's a great rental
B005LRWRZ8|4.0|A great metal band through time that put its own powerful metal music twist on the scene to be reckoned with.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Love the story line and the characters as they have developed.  Well filmed and the speaking isn't over-powered by the background music like the first Sherlock.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Now I have not had a chance to watch this one yet. But I know I will just love this movie. Planning on watching this movie very soon. It will more enlikely be a real tearjerker.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|Got the movie just in time to watch it with my students.  They had never seen it before, but loved it.
B00333NCTM|5.0|I read this book from start to finish within a few days. It was so good I couldn't put it down. Every moment I had of down time I was reading this.<br /><br />  Ozzy goes back in time starting from his life as a child, to working in a slaughterhouse, To Black Sabbath, to solo career, to sharon, to the tv show...EVERYTHING. You can pretty much hear Ozzy's voice as you read the words. It is filled with English slang and Ozzys mannerisms. This book is quite a laugh at certain parts. I found myself laughing out loud at times. There are some pretty cool facts that you learn about Black Sabbath and different albums as well.<br /><br />Whether your a die hard ozzy fan or listen to him every now and then, you will enjoy this book. I loved it and wish it coulda went on longer.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Ted follows John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) as he tried to balance his relationship with his girlfriend, Lori (Mila Kunis), and his magical teddy bear, Ted (Seth MacFarlane). What we get is a raunchy laugh-out-loud comedy with a pinch of innocence.<br /><br />First, when I use the word \\"innocence\\", I mean it has heart in its story; its a story about a man that struggles to grow-up after experiencing true friendship. I also mean: the comedy in this film is very balanced, as in, most jokes are dirty and raunchy while others are, for lack of a better word, innocent. The intro immediately comes to mind when Ted is first introduced as a character and John's father screams for his gun and the police, and Ted softly replies \\"Is it a hugging gun?\\". Aside from the major jokes shown in the trailers, some of these small lines really made me laugh or smirk. Don't get me wrong though, this is still an adult comedy. Also, it's packed with references from Flash Gordon, to the ringtones, and overall soundtrack; I loved this because it does it right. The acting was great, as well; Mark Whalberg, Mila Kunis, and Seth MacFarlane have great chemistry. Also, there are plenty of familiar faces and voices if you're a fan of Family Guy or American Dad. I knocked one point off because it was a bit predictable story-wise, and a little on the long side, but they weren't really significant problems.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed Ted, it was consistently funny with balanced jokes, so it didn't rely heavily on one type. Don't expect some type of mature or \\"sophisticated\\" comedy and you should be fine. I highly recommend a purchase or rental.<br /><br />Ted has some violence, strong language, drug use, and some nudity (one brief scene) (Unrated version)
B007EDYN36|5.0|I read both Gene and Ace's books and thought they were great. This was no dissapointment. I pre ordered this on my kindle before it officially came out and boom! in the morning there it was.<br /><br />  Just like the other two, Peter goes back and relives his life and tells you some crazy/funny/cool stories that happened before, during, and after KISS. Of course my favorite was when he was talking about the glory days of KISS in the 70's. He voices his opinions very openly about the other members of KISS. Especially Gene Simmons. It was nice to hear the story of a living legacy band through the eyes of the drummer for once. We finally see the story through the eyes of the Catman.<br /><br />  Every KISS fan will enjoy this book. I'm not crazy about KISS but i still found this book interesting and couldn't put it down.
1451695195|5.0|I enjoyed this greatly. He has been able to put into words ,experiences ,that I have had myself ,but am unable to express . A wonderful book ,written with love . Do yourself a favour and read this book.
B001E95ZI8|5.0|Rain Wilson is so funny in this movie. This is one of those movies where every now and then i gotta throw on for a good laugh.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I have the new Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this app is terrible on this device!  Pictures show up HUGE, and text is small.  Plus mine will only show about 5 new post and when you scroll down they all turn gray!  ??  Facebook works great on my iphone.  Not sure if it's the app or the device
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Was a decent book.  Too much of Corey's sarcasm.  I have always like the character of Corey, especially for his sarcastic comments.  But I think DeMille went a little overboard with it this time.  Some parts of the book sort of &#34;dead ended&#34;.  Could have developed more.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|And so I continued on...mighty entertaining.  Thinking about wearing a &#34;red room of pain&#34; shirt & see who gets it lol.  Actually DID NOT immediately continue to purchase the last book.  Guess I thought it was predictable...kind of like skipping to the last page and reading the end.
B000F8O35U|5.0|only place at the time where it was half price.  It was a gift from grand ma.  I have no more words.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Heard about it, but didn't realize it was three books.  What a trip!  Fun to read about someone that I would never want as a boyfriend/husband! Most entertaining book I've read in awhile.
B0041KVZ0Y|5.0|It's cool to hear this music remasterd and on vinyl! It feels like it takes me back to the days they were still together :)
B004LWZWGK|1.0|This is the worst batman movie ever. Christian Bale, WRONG GUY TO PLAY BATMAN FIRST OF ALL. Anne Hathaway as selina was the only bright spot in the movie. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this crap. NO comic relief, AT ALL. The villain I don't get. I guess, l like villains who are psycho and just total JERKS who are not witty. Get this, Batman becomes brokendown weak minded OLDMAN in this movie. Why even call this movie Batman? You only see him 20% of the time.  I couldn't believe some of the bad acting. Few wellknown actors, just not convincing and were miscast to begin with. It was like I was watching a TV drama cop show. I found myself bored within  first hour.  Thinking it was going to turn aound soon. Wrong! If you want to be depressed and bored for 2 hours. Watch it. I gave up. I rather had seen Batman Die, than watch that crap.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Having read this when I was little it was an interesting read to get back to<br /><br />Very good and definitely get your kids to read it .
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Everyone is in love with this show, and I'm no exception.  Brilliant.  Beautiful.  My husband and I are hooked.  Yep.
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|okay so I was doing a hard math prob. then all of a sudden it says error and then it freezes I don't understand it WAS working but not anymore
B000784WMW|5.0|This is my absolute favorite version of Jane Eyre.  I've seen it more times than I can remember and even now when I read the book, it's Zelah Clark's voice in my head.  I love how it is so true to the book, though not 100%, pretty close.  Charlotte Bronte is brilliant and this is probably my favorite book ever (and definitely in my top 10 favorite movies!)
B0076DELIG|4.0|Lots of twists and turns as well as action. Connelly always keeps you guessing!  I especially like the relationship Harry has with his daughter.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|A must have, can't put it down!!! if you enjoy bejeweld you'll definetely want this game... so addictive! Love it =)
B009JBZH54|5.0|I just received my shipment today. All of my disks were included as well as the ultraviolet copies, and booklet. I tested all of the discs and everything works perfectly.
B009E2WX3W|5.0|I liked so many songs from this album, no wonder it's the one everyone who's not a native fan will think of when they think of his distinguished career.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I didn't care for &#34;mopey&#34; Batman, but special effects were good.  A depressed Batman was just annoying!  Liked Cat Woman though!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It reads the pdfs I place directly on the device, instead of having to send it to my kindle e-mail account so that the native reader can download it, which takes longer than an instant, and is at least an instant longer than it ought to take to get a pdf... just a design flaw of the fire I guess.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|Wow! I absolutely loved this book. This story reminded me of old school storytelling, of books from yesteryear. With the 13th tale, the reader could come away with finding a 14th or possibly a 15th tale to be added.<br /><br />When Vida Winters, famous author, writes a letter to Margaret Lea, a biographer, Ms. Lea could not foresee what story was to be told. All Ms. Lea could think of is this is another one of Miss Winters' tales she loved to spin, but it turned out to be so much more than that.<br /><br />The writing is very strong in this book, and there were times when I felt the book could have ended, but after reading the way it ended, I see why it was necessary to keep the reader engaged--and engaged you shall be. I loved this book. A wonderful goodread for all to enjoy!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Really enjoyed the movie. It had lots of action and the script and actors did a great job of tying all the MIB movies together. I would recommend to everyone.
1439153663|4.0|This was a wonderfully written book that takes place in the 1800s during slavery, where we find Lavinia, the main character rescued by the Captain who takes her to live with him and his wife, Mistress Martha. She is immediately given to the servants of the household to look after her. The slaves welcome and embrace Lavinia with open arms, and at first she is reluctant because she does not understand why she is there, but soon becomes one with the servants and she's considered family.<br /><br />At the tender age of seven, there was much she had to learn, and the biggest was learning her \\"place\\" in society. Being around the slaves, she considered herself as one, and she quickly learns that her white skin afforded her benefits in society that she didn't understand why her black family couldn't have. The secrets that take place inside the Big House and the Kitchen House were unspeakable and the voice that she and her adoptive slave mother, Belle, tell is one that is soon hard to forget.<br /><br />This book will most definitely keep you turning the pages, but for me, the story was somewhat bittersweet. I suppose I gave this book 4-stars, which isn't a bad rating, because there was so much sorrow and it seemed like the wrong people didn't really get what they had coming, although one character, in particular did. When dealing with the subject of slavery, I don't suppose there's much joy that one can tell, but I did enjoy this story very much and the author did an outstanding job in spinning the tale. I feel she did this story justice.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this set of games engages you just enough to let you not think about anything else while still letting you relax...great to play after days work
B007J4T2G8|1.0|What do you get when you put a virgin and a sadistic non-feeling, broken man together?--Fifty Shades of Grey; however, I would call this book Fifty Shades of *&%$#*!<br /><br />I had heard so much about this book and how good it was and all the hype and this book was a complete let down for me on so many levels, I don't even know where to begin! Well, actually, not totally true--I do know where I'm going to begin.<br /><br />Let's start with the story? Oh yeah. . .that's right, WHAT STORY? Out of the twenty-eight chapters I read, I believe twenty-four of them were chapters of pure sex. I must admit, upon reading about the sexcapades in the beginning, it was a bit of a shock and tantalizing, but as the book unfolds, it continues, and continues, and continues and continues, and I'm reading waiting to find out what story is there other than sex?<br /><br />So Anastasia Steele meets the wealthy Entrepreneur, Christian Grey, by fluke because her best friend/roommate, Kate, was sick--so as a favor to her, Anastasia agrees to meet with Mr. Grey to interview him for Kate's college newspaper. Immediately, there is an electric charge of feelings between Ana and Chris, and quite naturally it develops into something more.<br /><br />Sexual desire burns between the two of them, and Christian advises Anastasia he is looking for a \\"Submissive\\" for his Dominant lifestyle and would like her to sign a contract agreeing to his terms. So, Ana is left with a dilemma--should she or should she not sign this contract. Oh by the way, the contract is not legally binding!<br /><br />Here's where the problem comes in. Although Ana never signs this contract in this first book of the trilogy, she most certainly tries, with all her might, to comply with some of the things Christian wants, because after all, she's in love with this broken soul--sexing on a trial-by-basis! I could see if there were many years between them, but we're talking an entire week--and within that week, loads upon loads of kinky, graphic and extremely descriptive sex takes place, and still no contract has been signed. Wow, amazing how feelings can develop within one damn week! Boy, what a lot of time to get to know someone, screw their brains out, and fall in love--all within seven days!<br /><br />So out of all the chapters of sex, which is literally every chapter, Ana manages to meet Christian, fall in love with a man who is definitely into S&M, screw, screw, screw, and screw some more, graduate from college, gets her degree, finds a job, and there's your story. Sex, sex, sex, sex! And this book is slated to become a movie. Hmmm, Rated \\"R\\" is the highest rating a movie can receive for the general public, but I believe in order for this sex-fest to be seen by the masses, Hollywood would need to make this an X-rated movie and offer to the public for sale on DVD, skip movie theaters all-together! The only movies I'm aware of that have tons of sex are adult films, with little plot, which that's all this book is!<br /><br />Now I'm being told by readers who absolutely LOVED this book that the other two I'll learn more about Christian and what makes him tick. I was told I'd learn a little something about him in this book. Well, yes, I learned something, but not much insight as to what makes Mr. Grey truly tick, other than his sick and twisted mind of how to hurt his Submissive sexually as a turn on! It is obvious that something very traumatic happened to him to cause him to be the way he is, and I'm supposed to learn that in the next two books, really?<br /><br />The only reason this book is on the New York's Best Sellers List is because of the sex. If you took away most of the chapters of sex, this book would have been a novella--yielding less than a hundred pages at best. I found this book to be fifty shades of pure 'D' Crap!<br /><br />I love great sex in a book, but every chapter is downright insulting and boring, and if you're going to heat up a reader, or at least this reader, you better have a damn good story to back it up, and I didn't find it in this one. This was Fifty Shades of Hype. I think some readers who found this book \\"all that\\" haven't had good sex in a while and need to get a damn room and use their imagination, but obviously some don't have any if one would think this book was that great! And yet, these are the same people that turn their noses up at porn. Some may have to rethink how they feel about that judgment, after having read this book! There isn't that much sex in the whole wide world! Sorry, didn't do much for me! As Ana stated to Christian, she needs more, well, so does this reader! I'm sorry I wasted my precious week on this *&%#%*@!etter have a damn good story to back it up, and I didn't find it in this one. This was Fifty Shades of Hype. I think some readers who found this book \\"all that\\" haven't had good sex in a while and need to get a damn room and use their imagination, but obviously some don't have any if one would think this book was that great!

B0009P5YXO|5.0|This is it guys, what I've been waiting for, Its the tenth Doctors sonic screwdriver.  Its the right size for your pocket, so you can take it anywhere and its a pen so you can actually do some good with it.  But really come on people even if it wasn't a pen you would still buy it, right?  Its crazy fun and I'm already driving my family mad with it, so i think this deserves a win!!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre with my sister.  I loved it so much I ordered it for my friend for Christmas.
B0060QM09M|5.0|My wife is an avid animal lover and likes James Herriot books and the humor in them. She can relate to him.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Really did expect so much more from this movie. I love the actors and director, but could have been better.
B007V508CC|5.0|The cd was in really, really good condition. I am definitely satisfied with it and it is a great album!
B009X00E18|3.0|I like the slim design. The protection it offers is good enough. The price is a little high for the materials used in this product.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|This game is too simple.  Didn't seem to be a challenge.  It replicates other games, but without the complexities of the other games.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|If you love the adventure /hidden object /puzzle type games like I do, I highly recommend this one!  I've played a ton of these and this is definitely one of the better ones.  you can zoom in (I played on my kindle fire).  the puzzles are pretty easy but that's what I tend to enjoy, as I like to play these games before bedtime. I would warn that this one is fairly addictive ...I ended up playing it non -stop and finished in about six and a half hours. it was worth it to pay the full price for the complete game.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Likeable character; easy to relate to; heading down a deteriorating path.  Chilling, but written in a way that makes it easy to understand, and somewhat less scary than thinking about it in the abstract.  No matter how you take the pill, alzheimer's would be a devastating diagnosis.
B005LAIGN2|4.0|It's 1944 and Blacks in the military is an experiment. They are kept in their own unit in Italy and not given any important missions so they can't really succeed. One black colonel and one white colonel believe in the 532nd and are in the states to convince those in charge that this black unit is capable of serving.<br /><br />Though it has the typical language of a war movie, the blood is less than I expected. It is a bit more lighthearted than most war movies, though I suspect this is to expand the viewing audience for more people to learn of the Red Tails story.
0765350386|5.0|Rarely am I hooked from just the first few pages of literary fiction, especially with epic Fantasy. It usually takes a couple of chapters to draw me in. Mistborn pulled me into the story in a few paragraphs. I was so invested in the story that I eventually bought the entire trilogy in hardbacks, another rarity for me.<br /><br />Every aspect of this incredible world was spectacular, from the intricate world building, the complex system of magic with the Allomancers, to the realistic yet poignant characters. I loved the world of Allomancy and rebellion of the oppressed Skaa, I could actually feel the ash failing from the sky onto my face. But it was the main characters,  the irreverent Kelsier, the wary but courageous  heroine, Vin, the mentor and protector Terrisman, Sazed, and the outwardly blase player Elend, were my absolute favorites things about this story.<br /><br />Mistborn is the first book in a remarkable series, this is the best , across any genre, that I have read in a decade. Very highly recommended.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love the game and the application is easy to use and responsive.great that it is free! I like that you can replay a level and try to pass it a second time. Great game to pass the time and keep you entertained and brain activated.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Maybe not quite as good as the first book, but I enjoyed it and will read the third one too!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This is a new and upcoming true to be classic icon of a movie. Beautiful graphics and story line to enchante all ages.
B00AHSINKO|4.0|I wonder if Tommy Lee Jones is cut out for comedy though.  He did play his role well but it was not the superlative performance of Ms. Streep.  Overall I think it is a must see but I do not see myself buying a copy for recurrent viewing
B00913P6G0|5.0|I LOVE Kendrick Lamar! He's a very talented artist! This album is awesome! It def worth getting. Came early and in perfect condition. :)
B004KA9UXO|5.0|I read this book when it first came out and couldn't put it down and it was just as good a read the second time around.<br />I am now reading the third book in the series of five, and have already downloaded the other three.<br />His style of writing flows well.  It helps to understand where he is coming from if you Google Frank Herbert and see where his ideas germinated.  It will give you a better understanding of his writing style.
B00004RJ71|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie! A must see! Movie was in perfect condition...and came very early. Thanks fort that lil suprise.
B007HACDLK|5.0|great book keep your interest, wanted to keep turning the pages.  I would recommend this book.  Not a love story but, it really kept your interest. looking forward to reading another of his books
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Mr. Grisham never fails to amaze me. I wish he'd publish more books throughout the year. His new releases are the only non-fiction books I read each year and indeed it's worth the wait.
B000002OZY|5.0|It's so strange to have teens who like the same music you listened to when you were in Jr. High School.  I hadn't heard this whole *album* since Jr. High! But I'd purchased the Tommy DVD for them and they fell in love. They didn't want the soundtrack, they wanted the original. I've now heard it in the house and the car as many times in the past few months as I did in my first 50 years put together. And believe it or not, I'm still not tired of it. :)
B004LQEYAG|5.0|This is among the very best of westerns ever, containing comedy, romance, first class actors, and fascinating story based on real historical characters, but with many liberties taken.  Robert Redford and Paul Newman are among the very best teams in movie history.  If you've never seen it, give it a chance.  I'm sure you'll love it too.
B0043RSK3K|1.0|To liberal one sided  had sloped opinion Hollywood view of history  I read half and was bored to death.maybe stone should move to North Korea.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|And he should, with over 2100 years to develop it! The dog Oberon is the perfect foil to add some great humor to an awesome action novel!

B009B8YZKS|5.0|This movie well worth the time, halo fan or not this was well done! Acting was good, special effects great and a good story!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I have been waiting so long for these classic three movies on Blu-Ray and I was not disappointed. The quality is amazing.  These films speak for themselves, so I won't bother to review the individual films.  Watching them on a big flat screen in surround sound completely blew me away. Do not hesitate to buy this trilogy!  There's great bonus features too, and even a free beverage coaster created in the style of a &#34;fourth movie disc&#34;.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I had purchased the case cover with my original order for the Kindle.  My good friend Penny (who helped me set up my Kindle account with Orange County Public Libraries) admired it on several occasions because she had no cover for her Kindle.  For her work on my behalf, I got her one as well.  She loves it!  (And so do I.)  It is durable and protective of a valuable device for reading, games, and the many Kindle perks.
B009FB3WQ4|5.0|The production was awesome, with top preformers singing some of Barbara's best songs, then ending with some by her as well.  Very welll done, beyond expectations.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Absolutely loved these books! Well written and addicting. I enjoyed the conclusion of the trilogy. Great way to complete the journey!
B0086700CM|5.0|its so great  i downloaded it on about 3 divices its crazy how good it is no problems at all great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
141659521X|5.0|This man is a genius!  His books keep getting better and better!!!  I hope he gives us much much more to read in the near future.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|I thought this was a strong finish to the trilogy.  I really enjoyed Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.  Although this film is much slower at times than the previous two, but I think the slowness plays well with the self discovery Bruce Wayne has to complete in order to not only safe himself and succeed, but to ensure Batman succeeds and lives on.<br /><br />As an aside, my viewing of this was off to a rough start.  It did not stream well through my Apple TV and I was forced to reorder through Amazon on my Roku.  It played flawlessly through Amazon.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I couldn't put it down.  When the end came it left me wanting more and I can't ask for more than that from any writer.<br /><br />Great story and great characters.  Look forward to reading other books from this author.
B00002MZ2C|3.0|As a fan of RATM, you can't say it's a bad product but it lacks the originality the first one has. Still, a couple of songs will blast you off your feet and make it worth listening.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|A must read book for the people who love history. Although the story was fictionalize the events capture the feudal age of JApan
B0000028RR|5.0|Those who were into music when it came out can only recall with emotion what a shockwave this album spread throughout the world. In my opinion, all but one song on this album are hits and 20 years later, it still sounds as fresh as ever.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Good book - fast read and entertaining.  But lead character's, Reacher,ability to quickly put the pieces together and act are a little far fetched.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game helps keep the kid in you alive .it fun. so much to do so many game to play I love it
B005NPCUC8|5.0|Love the guitar solo on &#34;Time,&#34; the vocal on &#34;The Great Gig in the Sky,&#34; and the guitar parts on &#34;Any Colour You Like.&#34;  This is an all-time great album; not much that I can say to improve it's reputation.  Worth having in your collection.
0525425764|5.0|Love the caractors in this series - always look forward to the next book.  Theo is like the kid down the street.
B003777QYQ|5.0|Like many of the other buyers of this book, I was hoping for insight into how King writes, how he's made his fortune, how he kicks out idea after idea. Luckily, he doesn't reveal any of that, at least not in the form expected.<br /><br />The book is mostly a personal bio of the man behind the books, his struggle as a former \\"average Joe,\\" how he toiled like the rest of us until his skill and determination got him where he is today. It's his unexpected honesty, straightforwardness, and realism that make reading this work invaluable. He admits what other authors of \\"writing books\\" don't. He tells us the writing life is frickin' hard and instead of looking for an easy way through, we should learn to love our chosen path and use the skills we have to derive the desired benefits from our own careers.<br /><br />There are a few sections of style guidance included, nothing more than you'd find in an academic style guide. Here, King confirms that the key to success is your own wealth of ideas, ability to be based in the real world while creating alternate worlds just as real for your reader, and putting your whole self on the page.<br /><br />Kudos to King on a valuable book...if only I could get through more than just one of his actual fiction stories....
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I enjoyed every word of this book and I am sure my husband was glad when I finished so that I wasn't waking him by laughing out loud in bed.  I got the Kindle edition for my iTouch and it was wonderful to have.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|Blu-ray. Breaking Bad. Brian Cranston. Esposito. one of the few most well written, incredibly directed, and entertaining TV serieses since HBO's The Wire. Yes, I said it! a cable series with the quality of one of the greatest HBO serieses out there, of all time. What more is there to say?
B009O07NDY|5.0|There can be no doubt that this a strong start for The Hobbit movies. There's just the right blend of innocence, familiarity, and excitement. It feels like Middle-earth but also has a new sense of adventure and discovery we weren't introduced to in The Lord of the Rings. It captures the spirit of Bilbo, the dwarves, and the forces of light and darkness in one complete package. Here's my track by track analysis:<br /><br />Disc 1<br /><br />My Dear Frodo (8:04)<br /><br />Reminiscent of \\"Days of the Ring\\" from The Return of the King, this track has lush strings leading us into the memorable Shire themes. It's like we never let Middle-earth, or that we're returning to its sanctity, akin to slipping on favorite, old pair of shoes. Then (after a repetitive triangle ding of all things) it gets darker to set the mood for the whole film, serving almost as an overture.<br /><br />Old Friends (4:29)<br /><br />This, again, takes us back to The Lord of the Rings, sounding very much like the music that backs Bilbo's narration in the extended edition of The Fellowship of the Ring, At the same time, there are variations, reminding us that these are new adventures. The friendly, homey hobbit theme is in full force, but like the previous track, it turns darker before the end.<br /><br />An Unexpected Party (3:52)<br /><br />\\"Like and yet unlike\\" as Gimli might say. This one is dark and different - with unexpected starts and stops. Yet it fits right into the musical universe Shore created for The Lord of the Rings. In the second half of the piece, Shore plays around with a 3/4 chromatic theme, like a medieval dance song - which will reappear throughout the soundtrack.<br /><br />Axe or Sword (5:59)<br /><br />This one reminds me of the music in Moria as Gandalf talks with Frodo about Gollum. It's not the same theme, but it's a slower number that combines light and darkness in a similar way to fill the soul with a longing to see the wonders of Middle-earth.<br /><br />Misty Mountains (1:43)<br /><br />A standout to be sure. Richard Armitage and the Dwarves are great, and the tune is out of this world, being deep, dark, and majestic and expressing an importance that's moving. Tolkien would have been proud. The song sells the whole point of the film, setting up the deep meaning the quest holds for Thorin. It's just so... Dwarvish. This will probably be remembered as the signature song for The Unexpected Journey. The song's melody is a cornerstone to the Hobbit soundtrack, reappearing throughout.<br /><br />The Adventure Beings (2:05)<br /><br />This one has a beginning that sounds similar to the music that follows Aragorn's tumble over the cliff in The Two Towers - when Legolas and Gimli are looking for him. Then it spills into a quick uptempo frolicking number reminiscent of when Sam and Frodo run into Merry and Pippin in Farmer Maggot's field. It's easy to imagine what's going on in the film here. An unexpected journey to be sure!<br /><br />The World Ahead (2:20)<br /><br />Bright and cheery, this track is like seeing the world for the first time, full of innocence and happiness, with strings, brass, and woodwinds trading the spotlight. It continues to play with that chromatic theme before working its way into the \\"Misty Mountain\\" theme.<br /><br />An Ancient Enemy (4:58)<br /><br />With its high strings, percussion, and choir (and 5/4 time) this one is sure to bring back memories of The Fellowship of the Ring. This is one of those dark, evil pieces sure to scare the kiddies. It even has a hint of that descending third motif that Sauron loves so much. It's reminiscent of Weathertop and Isengard... as if the two had a child.<br /><br />Radagast the Brown (4:55)<br /><br />Like Bilbo's song (from the closing credits of The Return of the King), this one uses a children's choir to deliver a sweet melody. Unlike Bilbo's song, it has a demented side (and a bit of a jig). Once it gets going, it moves swiftly and is full of rhythm, including an ascending motif and what almost sounds like a ticking clock.<br /><br />Roast Mutton (4:03)<br /><br />Beginning with tremolo and then adding pizzacato, this suspenseful piece will remind you of the music from The Return of the King as Pippin is trying to light the beacon! It has a different theme but the same mischievous smile to its phrasing as it builds up the suspense - like the beginning of \\"In the Hall of the Mountain King\\".<br /><br />A Troll-hoard (2:39)<br /><br />Just a mood setting piece, this one is dark and ominous but not really noteworthy, lacking a soaring melody to take center stage - probably on purpose.<br /><br />The Hill of Sorcery (3:51)<br /><br />This has a bit of \\"I wish the Ring had never come to me\\" music to it before reprising Radagast's theme. It's quite a percussive little piece, building suspense with a dark tone.<br /><br />Warg-scouts (3:02)<br /><br />As opposed to Radagast's ascending theme, the evil forces have a descending theme, backed by a quick beat, plenty of high strings and percussion. This track is certainly an action piece, full of suspense and thrills!<br /><br />Disc 2:<br /><br />The Hidden Valley (3:52)<br /><br />This one begins somewhat similar to the music in the background when Aragorn is looking at the entrance to the Paths of the Dead. There's a timeless or ancient quality to it that demands respect but simultaneously creates a feeling of unease. And then we get that familiar Rivendell music in all its glory! (Brings a tear to my eye.) The piece ends with an uptempo march with ascending strings.<br /><br />Moon Runes (3:20)<br /><br />This slow, somber number uses the various instruments of the orchestera to fill out some very long phrases that build the uneasy mood.<br /><br />The Defiler (1:14)<br /><br />Here we have one of them there evil pieces, with tremolo strings and deep brass creating tension above a percussive underscore. It would fit right into The Two Towers, but it doesn't last long.<br /><br />The White Council (7:38)<br /><br />This has some of the same themes as \\"The Hidden Valley\\" and \\"Moon Runes\\" and is more of the same, sounding ancient and majestic - with an occasional choir part thrown in and a tremolo ending.<br /><br />Overhill (3:44)<br /><br />After \\"The Misty Mountains\\" motif, LOTR fans will jump out of their seats as the track works its way into the Lothlórien theme, the opening notes of The Lord of the Rings prologue! It even has a bit of the Shire theme, stylized the same way as the end of The Two Towers when Frodo tells Sam he wouldn't get far without him (before telling him to go home in the next film). The track begins subtle and quiet before working its way into a more exciting tone, featuring stringed arpeggios over the Misty Mountain motif.<br /><br />Harry Defeats the Dragon (4:54)<br /><br />What the? Oops... accidentally switched my ipod on shuffle. My bad. Let's move on.<br /><br />A Thunder Battle (3:55)<br /><br />This is one of those \\"truth in advertising\\" tracks. It's a battle! The strings climb upwards, built on a swift matching beat (like that in the background of the Siege of Minas Tirith), and the excitement we expect from a Peter Jackson movie builds throughout this piece.<br /><br />Under Hill (1:55)<br /><br />We keep the swift beat but change the meter to really crank up the tension, with different parts of the orchestra working their ways in and out of the spotlight and to create one of the most exciting pieces on the album. You can almost feel the Goblins breathing down your neck as a repetitive 5/4 ascending motif plays.<br /><br />Riddles in the Dark (5:21)<br /><br />Not surprisingly, familiar music from LOTR pops up here, with the \\"History of the Ring\\" theme taking center stage. But there's another quality about this track that makes it new and different. There's a sad innocence and naivety to the music, with the strings and woodwinds playing simple lyrical lines - like the back half of The Fellowship of the Ring's prologue.<br /><br />Brass Buttons (7:38)<br /><br />This is a suspenseful piece that will have listeners on the edge of their chair, with various bits that move and out of leitmotifs previously established. It's clear we're approaching the end of the film! Much like the Dwarven chorus for Moria in The Fellowship of the Ring, deep voices chant a foreign tongue to set the mood before the (long) piece ends with a slower part with a more gentle choir.<br /><br />Out of the Frying Pan (5:55)<br /><br />Full of brassy urgency and staccato strings, this number is reminiscent of the great battles from The Lord of the Rings, with an uptempo pulsing rhythm and more edge of the seat excitement. This again uses a choir (and distortion) to accent the drama, with a hint of the \\"nature's reclamation\\" theme from The Two Towers.<br /><br />A Good Omen (5:57)<br /><br />Full of hope and featuring the choir, this song is... well, a good omen. It has a swift 4/4 tempo and makes you feel like you're soaring through the air!<br /><br />Song of the Lonely Mountain (6:01)<br /><br />Neil Finn is wonderful, singing this \\"Misty Mountains\\" song in his tenor voice. (It's done as more of a pop song of course.) Guitar and strings serve as the background. It also fittingly includes an anvil being struck.<br /><br />Dreaming of Bag End (1:57)<br /><br />This Celtic inspired track conjures up images of the Shire with its whistle and strings, giving the soundtrack a happy ending.<br /><br />Bonus Tracks!<br /><br />These bonus tracks are available with the special edition. Their short, but I think their well worth the purchase:<br /><br />A Very Respectable Hobbit (1:22)<br /><br />With its spritely version of the familiar Shire theme couched in the newer themes of The Hobbit, this is a bright, cheery fun track with that begins in 4/4 time with a heavy downbeat before switching to 3/4 time for a coda featuring the chromatic theme.<br /><br />Erebor (1:19)<br /><br />Texturing the background with a rhythmic pulse, this is an exciting piece foreshadowing the coming adventure. It reminds me of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in some ways, actually. However, unlike the Potter soundtrack, this features uilleann pipes to give it a Celtic feel. Very short, but fun.<br /><br />The Dwarf Lords (2:02)<br /><br />Reminiscent of The Two Towers and The Return of the King, this track will bring back memories of the men of Edoras and Minas Tirith preparing for war - and yet it has its own charm as well.<br /><br />The Edge of the Wild (3:34)<br /><br />String arpeggios lead us into a bright version of the \\"Misty Mountains\\" music, conjuring up a spirit of adventure.
B004EARTN8|1.0|The movie is unbelievably bad. As a viewer, I waited for something to happen during the entire movie, but nothing happened. When the movie ended, I thought that it was a joke! I was still waiting for something to happen...
B009WO7NQO|4.0|its a good game needs easier way to pay confused.  very well its a fun and exciting game 4allthe ages to play
B002XLBC6K|4.0|I first heard of Green Carnation while driving to a concert a few towns away. The person I was driving with, owned this album. I'll admit that an hour is a long time for a song, but this Tchort wrote it so fluidly that it never gets boring. Buy this album.
0439023521|5.0|Devoured this book during a summer vacation.  Fast paced story with good character development.  Appeals to a wide range of readers; my 12 year old son, my husband and I all read it back to back.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Definitely a great addition to the collection. Amazing quality on the kindle also. Worth renting on instant video for movie night.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Sometimes hard to tell if some tiles are open but otherwise good game. I would recommend this as a good game.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book caught me on page one and I couldn't put it down. I knew the outcome but was in awe with the men and women who keep our country and half the world a safe place. The true details behind the &#34;perceived&#34; news story made me shut off the evening news with contempt for the political machine.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I bought this for my daughter as I have made her a huge Dr. Who fan... She hasn't got to play with it yet.  But I love it.  I sonic everything.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Interest sparked by watching the movie and with reading the book I found myself only ever more enthralled with &#34;Catnips&#34; story of rebellion against an overly oppressive government... Amazing read especially enjoyed the many plots twists and the unlikely ability of the seemingly inferior competitors of the games to challenge and outwit the crazed President Snow.
B000SW4DXK|3.0|5 stars for the movie, one star because I ordered it in part to watch it on my iPad through the Amazon instant video app and it wouldn't work with my airplay and apple TV... no video showed, only sound.  please fix this amazon.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is a whole lot like mincemeat and I am advertising this game, it's so freaking AWESOMEST of AWESOME
B006WQLH7G|5.0|SOLID performance. Updates on its own several times per day and keeps on eye on everything going on.<br />Great reputation, SOLID performer.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|Great game but It needs something, something like being able to shoot webs everywhere and anywhere you want. So anyway I would recommend this game.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love all the music on this CD.  We listen to it in the car and in our house all the time!
B000FBFMFW|4.0|Book started off slow but picked up. The ending could have been better written. Characters ended with the story in terms of development.
B001GCUO5W|5.0|If you haven't seen the movie, it's definite MUST BUY, especially if you're into mind-bending thrillers.<br /><br />The story follows Teddy Daniels, a Federal Marshal tasked with investigating an escaped patient at the harrowed Shutter Island facility. But as soon as he lands on the island, he realizes that there's something more going on this island than he knows about.
1451675046|5.0|This book is easy enough for children to read. This book is brilliant. Great for adults but even better for children. Great way to introduce science and reality to those who lack common sense......
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|Worked as expected and liked the movie. If you like a good plot then you will enjoy this movie thoroughly. Liam does a good job.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think building and being an architect will help my son get smarter :) it is also a good game for adults. I build on it :)
034580404X|5.0|OMG! What a hot book to read, drove me absolutely crazy ;) grea, great, great, read! Would reccomend to all you romance lovers out there.
B0019OP0GU|5.0|The family will love all characters.  You fall in love with each girl and their crazy extended family.  A moral lessons to teach your kids about what makes up a family and the behavior of each girl.  You'll love watching this movie.  Good clean fun, humor, and sadness.  A keeper!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I like the style of writing, the story has some twists and turns that make me want to pick up the book as soon as I get home from work. However I control myself so I can relax later in the evening with it.
B001P06GX4|1.0|while the game board and pieces are virtually identical to the Blokus game I already own, this was bought as a gift with just in time delivery and the fact that the game title is not Blokus was embarrassing.  And it was not wrapped in a box to protect the game box.  All other products fulfilled by Amazon come with careful highquality wrapping to protect the game box, but this game box was simply covered iwth brown paper and shipped which resulted in a slightly crushed game box.  I was further embarassed that my knock-off gift box was in poor condition.  I should have bought the original game from a different vendor.  Frankly it seemed like false advertising and if i was not so busy i would have pursued Amazon for a refund but the date had arrived when i needed the gift and i gave it as received.  Very dissappointing behavior by the vendor
B008ELUEQC|5.0|One of the best Christmas albums in a long time. Love Rod Stewart and he chose great songs and even greater stars to preform with him. Love Love Love it.
B009329ZF2|3.0|worked on bb63 when we reactivated it for 18 months. 5 inch guns are pretty deadly.<br />I guess I know to much about this ship.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I thought the first book would be the best of the trilogy but Catching Fire has surpassed Hunger Games.  Can't wait for the last book.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is one of our families favorite movies! It a classic Dickens story done by the classic Muppets. It's so funny and so heart warming. We have small children who are sensitive to scary ghost scenes and I feel this movie does a good job not making them too scary,even a bit funny!  Marley and Marley are my favorites! It's become a family tradition to watch every Christmas now!
1401308201|5.0|bought for my son he has it displayed in the house he loves it and I would recommend this to anyone who loved wicked nice memoriabilia
1439152802|4.0|Now no one shoot me when I tell them that this is my first book by Kate Morton. Am I still alive?! Ok, yes I know that I should have definitely picked up a book by Kate Morton before now, but I read this one and I know that it will inspire me to read more! I have read so many rave reviews about many of her books and I just didn't want to feel left out anymore. Kate really has a knack for painting a truly gothic world full of secrets and mystery in this book. That is a characteristic that I read about in a lot of the different reviews on her books, so it must just be one of her trademarks. Each chapter, little by little, Kate unfolds all the secrets of the Nicholson family and especially the girls' mother, Dorothy.<br /><br />Laurel Nicholson witnessed her mother stab and kill a man that appeared at their doorstep when she was sixteen years old. She and her mother shared a secret about that day and what really happened when he arrived that they left out of the story for everyone else. This past memory continues to haunt Laurel even into her adult life, and when she returns to her childhood home she decides to investigate her mother's past and learn just who she was before she became their \\"Ma.\\" Laurel was definitely the character that I loved to follow the most because she was the one that was piecing everything together like a gigantic puzzle. The chapters would alternate between her and her mother, Dorothy, and honestly sometimes I would skim Dorothy's chapters because I felt like it was a lot of useless information and rambling.<br /><br />I really enjoyed moments when all of the sisters were together, but it bothered me that Laurel had to carry this secret alone for all these years and that she never shared it with any of her sisters. The family dynamics that are built in this story are so touching and made me feel so comfortable while reading. So many memories were shared between the girls including the house and some memories they made with their mother. I cannot figure out why, but Dorothy's character just bothered me the entire way through the book. Then I got to the end and figured out just exactly why I didn't like her. The end came as such a shock to me, and I will tell you that if you plan to pick up this book, I know it's over four hundred pages and really big, but reading every page until you find out the big secret is so worth it. I was so surprised and honestly NEVER would have guessed it!<br /><br />This book and the mystery and hidden secrets built more and more chapter by chapter. Sometimes I felt warm in the company of sisters and sometimes I felt chills in the face of unknown secrets and hidden agendas. This book is most certainly a puzzle and a journey intermixed between the past life of Dorothy and the present life of her daughters and son, Gerry. I would recommend this book to almost anyone with a passion for reading because I know there is something here for everyone!<br /><br />***Thank you to the publishers at Atria Books for providing me with a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review***
B005LAIIQC|1.0|I saw this movie in the theaters and refuse to add it to my collection.  This is the worst movie of the 4.  The story appears to only be a bridge to launch the new character....and that bridge is poorly built.<br /><br />Suggestion...wait for the movie to show up on USA Network in a few months.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|$10 lightning deal could not be resisted! Shipping was fast, item was in perfect condition.  And, as a redhead myself, I love any chance to see a ginger Disney princess!  This movie was beautifully made.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|This app only works taking pics of self. Sure you can turn the screen sideways but still have to be able to see what it's seeing in order to take a pic. NOT a good set up.
B002SEQ8ZM|5.0|Got this set for my nephew who LOVES this movie and he loved the set he put the pics on the wall
B005LAII1C|5.0|I actually saw the movie at the theatre, and my &#34;better half&#34; loved it so much that she had to have the Blu-ray. BUT, THIS MOVIE IS DEFINITELY NOT A CHILDRENS MOVIE --- ADULTS ONLY!!!
0783116934|5.0|This is pretty much a coming of age story for the former USSR, leaving its past and discovering that even if you try to censure your people, evil will still find its way in.  It is based on the true story of a serial killer Andrei Chikatilo that preyed on women and children on the USSR's rail lines for more then 12 years, killing a confirmed 53, but claiming the count was more then 56.  It examines how Soviet hieracy refused to believe that a serial killer could be amongst their midst and that it had to be the work of several &#34;deviants&#34;.<br /><br />Brilliant performance from Stephen Rea, playing forensic specialist Viktor Bukarov, who spent seven long years trying to stop this human monster, only to be stopped by bureaucratic redtape along the way.  Donald Sutherland and Max Von Sydow also give solid portrayals as men who had to break away from the old ways of solving crimes in order to keep the citizenry safe.<br /><br />Citizen X is not an easy film to watch, but it allows a look to how things were done in the past - and hopefully how they can be improved in the brave new future.
B000002UAO|5.0|I liked this product because it brings back many memories and is of good quality.  I love to play it.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|Katy's bio pic of a movie shows off her fun, sweet and loving side along with the term oil of her marriage ending. Worth a watch for sure.
B0097PW7H8|5.0|this app is awesome it tells u ur battery percentage and tell u how long u got left on it. it's very useful I recommend every one to go down load it asap
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I have never seen Indy look so good before Blu-ray does magical wonders to any film and Indiana Jones is not an exception to that.
B0083H6AQA|1.0|The hype on this movie got me real interested in the film because I am a fan of Robert Pattinson.  But, I<br />absolutely hated this movie.  I didn't think it was a good storyline at all.  I love Robert but, not this movie.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|You can't go wrong with this movie. It's a feel good start singing your lungs off movie definitively worth a watch.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love this arcade game. Takes me back all the way to the early 90s with this one great app
B009JBZH54|5.0|I didn't own any of the films, so being able to get all three on blu-ray for $28 was an awesome deal I couldn't pass up.
B009329Y30|4.0|Great story line, the books are always better but this comes pretty close to it. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Nicholas Sparks books.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|Love legos, this is nicely done. great instructions, my 16 yr old son had it completed in just 2 days.
B004WGIXX4|4.0|I would watch Natalie Portman read the phone book, but she shines as an overworked Intern looking for emotional release in this movie.  This movie captures the ideal of every 18 year old young man who hopes to get a complete social education from a delicious woman like Natalie.  I rather liked the movie and I am 84 with a full set of teeth and an enhanced memory.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|I've read few books from this author and think it is one of his best works. The ideas in the book put all of author's previous work in perspective and present one coherent view of the world.
B00003CXI1|3.0|There is a line included in the cable version of this movie that explains why the know-it-all Hermione is bonded to the male pair of protagonists.  I have searched, bought and thrown away more of this movie than any other I have ever bought.  In spite of your boast that you included seven new scenes in this movie, the simple line, after the troll incident,  was not included.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|easy to use, lots of options,  love the snooze. feature and the gentle fade in to my favorite music.  I use it daily
B009IEXKXI|5.0|By far one of the best Kindle books I have read in two years. Engrossing story of a man's survival under terrible odds. It's funny and nerve racking all at the same time. I can't suggest this book enough to those who are thinking about reading it.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I liked the selection of songs and the variety on this CD. The songs were well suited to Susan Boyle's singing style.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|Game is fun to pass the time. There is no colorblind mode, which does become an issue at times. But if you like this type of game, it's worth it.
B007N9FKCY|3.0|retro platformer with some cute graphics but the mario influences are a little much. for 3 bucks its overpriced, for free its good, so I will meet it halfway
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm a reader, not a writer.. I wish I could just click five stars and say thanks. There are plenty of reviews saying how great these books are and why. So for the author.. I loved these books! I loved the characters & the way you made me care about them. I usually read prepper type things, so Im not sure how I found my way to your books, but I am very glad that I did :) I have already bought the next two & will be browsing through your other pieces. You did a really great job here & I am looking forward to MoAr ! Happy Holidays!
0226039331|3.0|I bought this book because this is the #1 Gerek-English lexicon today. I have to confess that I was a lite disappointed when I started to use it. The title says that it is a Lexicon of the &#34;New Testament and Early Christian Literature.&#34; Yet, in the past few weeks I had many occasions when I tried to find a Greek word used by one of the Church Fathers, but the word wasn't listed in the lexicon. But it is a useful help for those who want to have a better understanding of the New Testament.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|This movie is near perfect.  I found myself watching with my mouth open scene after scene.  It is a great demo film for high end home theaters and it had good use of 3d.  I highly recommend it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed learning more about Gideon and Eva. The book was hard to put down. I cant wait for the third book!!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Love it, can't wait for the next game!!! Enjoying every minute of this game! Can't go wrong with this one! Winner!
B003B1X80Y|5.0|This was a really good movie to watch. I would highly recommend it for movie night at the house! Thanks!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|i enjoyed this movie. its funny and original.i i couldn't stop laughing. my favorite part is flash gordon and the supermarket scene.
B00A6N8F4Y|2.0|I was very disappointed. I expected way more out of an Oliver Stone movie... The acting was pretty bad and the entire movie was violently explicit...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Some games I don't like, but others I love!  from in the water to being on land, u have a wide selection
B005ETA5K2|1.0|Short and simple,  Did not work at 450 feet from server.  Found other product thar filled the bill.  Would not suggest this product to anyone.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Best flash I've ever used and works great with the D7000, I use it on many different occaisions and you won't go wrong purchasing this.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Good app but puzzles tend to disappear after downloading a new one. I would not pay for their puzzles as I doubt you would be able to keep them when adding more.
0374275637|5.0|There's a lot to say about the content of this book, but many have already done so... This is a book worth having and reading... several times. But I would like to comment on the \\"book-making\\" aspect of this book. The two papers that resulted in the Nobel Prize in Economics for Dr. Kahneman are included in the back of the book -- big plus, as I wanted to read the original thoughts prior to starting reading this book. But those papers are printed in 8 point font! I kept looking for \\"make larger\\" button on the cover! It was very hard to read. The text was so small that it made eye-tracking from line to line difficult. This is a large book, there was no reason to conserve a few extra paper pages that would have provided for a good experience for its readers. But I would caution anyone away from getting a Kindle version of the book (which does have an option for making the text larger) -- the footnotes and illustrations (graphs and tables) would be a nightmare on a digital device.
B00992CF6W|5.0|how do I get mobs on this game help please!!!! how do I get mobs mobs are so cool its funny when they follow you
B004EBZX6W|5.0|A great application.  Easy to use and configure, and does exactly what it should.  Good tool fo finding &#34;cold&#34; spots in the house, and ultimately gave me the data to change the channel on my home wireless and improve performance by 30%.
B004I8WD6E|3.0|The case is ok built and the screen protectors are not the greatest. It did however protect my phone when dropping it. After a long use my hands started getting sore do to the hard surface and texture.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book in three hours. It was totally worth the lost sleep. The love story was an unexpected twist.
0743289692|1.0|I wanted the book for a gift to a friend and it was advertised as new. When it arrived it was obviously used. It had some crumpelled pages and an ink smear across the top. The invoice with the book stated &#34;new&#34;
0517543052|5.0|This starts off slow and gets really good! I've been writing down things all the way through, (after the first white pages section) so I can re-read, remember, and share them... The artistic way the majority of the book is written is awesome, and that's just an added benefit to what's a must-read in my opinion.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael and Harry continue to be my favorites!  Will Michael retire Harry and move him to the Tampa Bay area?  I wish!
0425263908|4.0|I enjoyed the book, Im looking forward to the next one in the series, I ordered this book because it was compared to the 50 Shades trilogy, I can say that I enjoyed the 50 shades storys better, I read all three books in one weekend, and have since re read them while waiting to get other books. Not sure why but I was more pulled into the 50 shades story than i have been with this book. My opinion only
B009O5CLZY|4.0|Nice alternative to Jetpack joyride. One advantage is that you seem to stay alive quite a bit longer in this game. My only complaint would be that on my Kindle Fire it takes a bit to load up and get going. However, once you do get going you'll be in for a good time.
B001974DG0|5.0|I chose to give this book a 5 because it is a great story that truly encompasses all that you would look for in a Dean Koontz novel. It was not at all what I was expecting yet met all I was looking for. I can't begin to imagine a sequel even though I long to know what happens to the characters moving forward....but isn't this how all good books end??? With you wanting more, of course!
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Wool 1 is by far one of the best reads I have ever had. Ever!! But even the auther admited he never planned to expand. There is defineally some stretching that has gone on to creat the tension. There is also some &#34;oh come on&#34; moments where things just don't seem feasilbe to end up how they did. But I will say the only reason I gave it a 3 instead of a 5 is because Wool 1 was so good the bar was impossible to meet.
0307454541|1.0|Much of the book seemed rather unplanned; like the author was writing without know where he was headed. The sex and violence seemed unnecessary and over-the-top. I wonder if the author added the perversions as a way to sell more books--because they didn't contribute to the story.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|You all know the story by now. This is a great book from beginning to end. If you are a fan of midevial books this is must have. There is just enough fantasy in there to wet my lips but it is by no means magical sorcery book. The only complaint I have is that it is 800 pages and only book 1 of 7. I can't bear to commit to reading the rest. I'll stick with the HBO from now on. But I couldn't put it down and stayed up to midnight everynight reading it.
1439102813|5.0|From page one, I was engaged with the main character. Every action of every character seemed true-to-life. I couldn't put it down.
B000X107GI|5.0|This is what I wanted and what I got. They last as long as you would expect so the quality is not an issue. The price is crazy good so why not buy from here. Shipping was fast as well
B000F8O35U|5.0|This is all my 12 yr old wanted for Christmas. Teaches cause and affect of our actions and the consequences but also the reward of getting it right.
B008GVD6D8|1.0|Nothing but boring porn. Find something more interesting to read or find a man  is what my wife said .
B005RUV0NY|4.0|WARNING if you watch this series it will alter your reality... You will prepare for Zombies!<br />Zombies make life easier... if they get in your way you can kill them.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Well written and interesting all the way through, read by me, my wife and my daughter this is a series to rival the best series out there.
B001CDZZI6|3.0|I think you get a lot of vague and fairly general information from this book but it all leads up to you needing to buy another product/service. Why can't it stand alone? Or at least state that in the description?
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Another quality book in the series. From the first page to the last your kept intrigued and wanting to know more. My daughter couldn't put the book down.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Allows me access to full Premium suite that I have been using for years from my Tungsten to BB to Android.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|My one and a half year old sat through this entire movie!  It kept his attention and my three and a half year old.  Loved the music and the beautiful scenery.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Serves it purpose for when I need it otherwise nothing special about to promote, positive or negative at this time.
B004HE5K5A|4.0|This is a good set to buy if you already have a sufficient number of basic bricks and are looking for additions such as fruits, vehicles and people. Otherwise the building fun might be quite limited. All the pieces in this set are nicely made and add loads of play value to other duplo blocks. We love the two crates and the billing machine. The van is a good size and  a complete toy in itself. Highly recommended to enrich your existing Duplo collection but probably not the best set to start with.
B004SDEP38|5.0|I have been using this application for years, started with my Tungsten 5, moved to my Blackberry, and now to Android.  Can't be without, allows me ability to work while traveling out of pocket when I don't have access to my laptop.
0345803493|5.0|Showed up with no damage to the book, loved the first one and can't wait to dig into the second!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|By focusing not just on Abraham Lincoln but on all of his most important rivals for the Presidency in the 1860 election as well, Ms. Goodwin has given us a fresh perspective on perhaps the most written-about period in American history. That Ms. Goodwin also happens to be a masterful writer and witty story-teller (as was Lincoln) makes the book a reading experience to be treasured. This may look like a long book, but for all its literary weight and depth, it is completely absorbing and hard to put down. I hated to see it end. All in all, an extremely satisfying reading experience.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I want more. This is such a wonderful book! I can  wait until  the movies so u can watch it on screen.
B005CA4SJW|5.0|This was perfect just like the photo. I am very happy with this product! Please keep up the good work! Very satisfied! Thank you!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm used to reading Urban Fiction but I decided to change it up a bit & boy, am I glad I did. This is the best book I've read in a very long time. I can't wait to read the next two books.<br />The romantic aspect of the book was something that I liked with me being a hopeless romantic & all. I, also, loved how the author gave the other tributes a character...not just names.<br />I most definitely recommend this book to all.<br /><br />ABSOLUTELY GREAT!!!!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This was perfect just like the photo. I am very happy with this product! Please keep up the good work! Very satisfied! Thank you!
B0031ES8P6|3.0|It was so much acuter in the product image than the real thing. The dress didn't pop out as much as in picture.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I kept seeing this book everywhere and read a bunch of reviews on it, I finally caved and bought it a couple days ago. I read it last night in like four hours. I can't believe I waited so long to read it. It was absolutely amazing!!! I cried a couple of times and didn't know if I would be able to finish, but I did and I could not have been happier. It really is a outstanding story. Who wouldn't want to fall in love with their best friend and have him prove how much you really mean to him. Some may say that Travis's possessiveness of Abby is wrong, but I don't think it is. He would do anything to protect her and keep her from pain and Abby is the only one that keeps Travis sane. Abby drove me a bit crazy when she wouldn't admit she wanted him back at Thanksgiving, but that happens sometimes, people make mistakes. For Travis to forgive Abby without hesitation just solidifies how much he truely loves her. I can't wait for Walking Disaster now. I always love when the POV is from the guy.
0486414124|4.0|Very entertaining. Northanger Abbey is often referred to as Jane Austen's \\"Gothic parody.\\"<br /><br />Catherine, a sweet, naive 17-year-old girl from a tiny rural farming village gets the chance to visit the big, bustling resort town of Bath England with chaperones.<br /><br />The first half of the book is the typical comedy of manners that Jane Austen writes.  Young Catherine arrives and is introduced to new friends in Bath. The most notable of these new friends is new BFF, the scheming Isabella, a classic mean girl who is a phony and a user. Isabella's deviousness goes right over poor Catherines head. For a while Catherine gets led around by the nose and manipulated this way and that by Isabella until Catherine finally figures out how to out maneuver her.<br /><br />The second half of the book is where most of the Gothic satire is written. It's has decrepit castles, mysterious chests, secrets, scandals, cryptic notes, and tyrannical fathers with a few amusing twists and turns but nothing shocking. A fun read if you like Jane Austen and/or Gothic Literature.
B00A12VJZM|5.0|...but I like it.  I've got everything they've ever recorded and this is most of their hits in one package.
B00A1EOBJQ|2.0|Been waiting on this CD since the show started.  Fade into You, the best song of the show in my opinion, is not on this CD nor it is on the \\"deluxe\\" edition CD being sold at Target. Can't even begin to tell you how irritated I am. Yes, I know I can buy it on ITunes.  But I don't WANT to.<br /><br />I might send this CD back. Haven't decided.<br /><br />Natalie S.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|i was surfing amzon for gifts for christmas for my kids and a friend. i decided on this dvd. i got it on time and im very happy. i would recommend amzon, thank ou so much.

B00136NUG6|5.0|It's Earth,Wind & Fire for goodness sakes!  What's not to love? Get off your butts and dance, dance, dance!  Boogie down!
B001NLKT60|5.0|This entire series is absolutely awesome. By now you've already read the first and are hooked like I was. by the way, check out the original Swedish films (all three) with Amazon Prime streaming content.
0060899190|5.0|I LOVE these books. They are so interesting. I am happy with my purchase and would recommend :) there a great read
B0015DROBO|5.0|This entire series is absolutely awesome. Hands down the best series of the year, and the first one I read with my Kindle. By the way, check out the original Swedish films (all three) with Amazon Prime streaming content.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I bought this after hearing so many people go on and on about how amazing this book was. It was decent. Not really a book I got into a whole lot. Its mostly just tends to repeat itself over and over again.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This entire series is absolutely awesome. Sorry it's over, but glad it's all resolved. by the way, check out the original Swedish films (all three) with Amazon Prime streaming content.
031617615X|5.0|I bought this simply to complete my collection (had all the other books) its great, came as described. Would recommend.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love it! it comes In super handy and the keys and numbers are huge so even with my glasses off I can use it. great app.
B0071AKB38|5.0|Small speaker with a great sound. So handy for anywhere. I'm so happy with the quality of sound. I recommend this tiny giant.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|its cute and simple. especially for little kids. good for both girls and boys. the characters are precious and the graphics are awesome.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This we will watch more than once.<br />Amazon has such great prices and product selection.<br />Was so glad I could find it here.
B008L40Q7E|5.0|Saw the movie &#34;Dr. No&#34; years ago, but never read the book.  It was better than the movie with so much Bondesk macho.
B005LAII1C|3.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, Mississippi<br /><br />I've liked almost every movie Mark Wahlberg has been in. He was great in The Departed (2006), The Fighter (2010), Shooter (2007) and Contraband (2012). I even liked him in what he calls his favorite role Max Payne (2008).<br />I've had a distant admiration for him since he battled back against a rough start. By the age of 13 he was addicted to cocaine and got in trouble with the Boston Police Department some 25 times.<br />\\"Everything I did wrong was my own fault. I was taught the difference between right and wrong at an early age. I take full responsibility,\\" he said. Even though he likes to forget it, I even dug  Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch.  \\"Good Vibrations\\" went to #1 in 1991.<br />So when I heard Mark decided to make Ted I was in. He said he didn't want his kids thinking he was a \\"bad dude\\" or \\"scary person\\" because of the roles he usually plays. But Mark I'd take violence over a filthy mouthed Teddy bear any day.<br />This could have been, should have been a truly wonderful family film. A small reclusive boy wishes one night his Teddy bear could really talk. The next morning the bear talks, walks and shares his opinions. They even go to a cool spot that \\"talking critters\\" usually don't go. Everyone can hear him not just the boy. He ends up on Johnny Carson but in the long run everyone gets used to the idea that the stuffed animal talks.<br />But instead of being family friendly, the bear smokes dope, chases woman and has a filther mouth than a sailor.
B0000UJDLM|3.0|The quality was well below what I expected. It was barely VHS quality! Added related content is skimpy at best.
0316227706|5.0|Fun book with gorgeous photos that inspire lots of giggles and guffaws while flipping through. I'm gifting it to several of my family this year.
B0050PYNN0|1.0|Horrible HORRIBLE movie. My husband, who normally lives for dumb movies like this, turned it off after 15 min. Dont waste your money or brain cells on this
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|Fantastic read. Loved it from front to back. Inspiring life with so many different turns. I am not into long books, especially biographies, but this was one book I couldn't put down.
B007N9FKCY|3.0|It's an ok game, but the fact that you have to play each level three times is a bit much. There are two easy objectives, which are collecting gems and a cat; however, doing the level in a small amount of jumps can be extremely frustrating. I'd suggest leaving room for error, of at least one or two jumps, so that it can be more enjoyable. Otherwise, racial connotations aside, it is a good game.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Great story, I cant believed what this guy had to overcome. This is the best book that I have read in a long time.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Very good book that gives a good picture of the sacrifice our troops make to preserve our freedom especially the special ops soldiers.
B004OC07GM|4.0|All business strategy discussed in the book is fantastic, this is a must read book to learn drivers to be succesfull facing nowadays challenges in a very competitive business environment
B000TERDNO|5.0|I have worked out to this album since the 80's! Love it! Its the right combo of high energy songs bring it up yo!
B00571F26Y|4.0|Good book, very well written, easy to read with everyday language. I only wish I had bought a paper copy so I could add post it notes etc, the fact that there was a six month wait at the regional library speaks to the popularity of this book.
B005LAIISU|5.0|Really Good Speed on Delivery and also is a great Movie.<br />We enjoyed this moving a lot and did not expect to since the others previous to this were pretty good.<br />This was even better!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|quick read for a 1000 page book, well paced, easy to follow shifts in locations and characters, and he does a good job of helping to remind us of who the characters are as we return to them, there are so many to remind remember.  I felt like I know many of them personally
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I watched the dvd to see if there was skipping, but it ran clean, so all is good. This was a good story, but not as re-watchable as iron man or avengers.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Every now and then comes a thinker that has the ability to synthesize complex thoughts across disciplines. Nassim Taleb is such a thinker. I am indebted to this synthesis. I have read every book from this 21st Century renaissance author and a great many technical papers, but Antifragile may be the pinnacle of his thought.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book more enthusiastically. I actually purchased the Kindle version AND then wanted the hard cover for my library. BTW, this is my first and only book review and I have purchased more than 100 books from Amazon.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I love the reboot for star trek. Story and character driven with a lot of nods to the older series.  I look forward to more from this series.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|This book was confusing the first time I read it, and I started it over. It is a great story once you figure out what is going on. The author wove these plots together masterfully, and the clues that are there between the plot lines are subtle but fascinating. It is definitely a book worth reading carefully.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I like the story in this one and it has that re-watchable quality about it. This is definitely needed as a prequel to the first avengers though.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|well it chess for sure I'm not a pro or anything but its definatly the full game. I'm a personal fan of the lovely redoubt button.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Fun movie and I love those dogs. Squirrel! My wife said we had to get it, so we did.  Kids will love it later I am sure.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I loved the 3d aspect of the movie. I also liked the concept, and the idea of the movie. looking forward to the next one and hopefully, director's loss(his brother) would not effect his judgment for the next movie. godS bless them all and I think this is one of the best movies ever.
B006WXHJNU|5.0|This was by far the best of the hulk movies, but still average compared to the other marvel movies.  I think the avengers actually was the best &#34;hulk&#34; movie so far.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|Wow, after the first one I had to watch the next and the next, etc. It is so nice just to have it on Instant Video. I could pause or stop. Awesome show.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|It's unscratched, enough said!<br />Ok so I have to type more according to the &#34;words required&#34; counter. Why? I don't know.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|An excellent read and a great second instalment. Looking forward to the third book.  Well researched with<br />just the right amount action.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I've got two different weather apps and this one gives me the longest forecast and most detailed information.  Works like it should, no problems.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book keeps you guessing all the way through it and as a parent you can sympathize with the character but the ending is a total shocker!
B001F9Y2CM|5.0|Sounds great.  Nice small package.  Exactly as described.  Shipped quickly and with care.<br /><br />Most of the songs I had never heard before and they are just as good as the stuff off ABBA Gold.  In fact a couple of songs you wonder why they weren't big hits for them.  Even on Ring Ring, being their first album, you can hear the sound that made big hits by Voulez-Vous and Arrival.  Incredible body of work.  A shame it did not last, but with this set you get pretty much everything (with the exception of some bootleg stuff that only a die hard would know of).<br /><br />For the price, an incredible deal.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Things really heated up in this book.  I can't wait for the next book so I can see what happens next!
B004J4WNL2|3.0|The book gives one a good idea of the traits of an introvert and an extrovert. Howerver there were too many examples with stories and facts. I think the book could have been half the length and would have been enjoyed more.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The simpler levels are great for kids, the tough ones challenging enough to keep me entertained on my daily train commute!
B005UDD1R6|3.0|I think this will be a good media player for my MP3 collection. It was easy to download and install.
B007HACDLK|5.0|better than the assassin.<br />wish it was a little longer.<br />left clear openings for sequels.<br />hope he keeps them coming.
B005V4FJC4|5.0|I'm a huge holiday music fan, and She & Him put a mellow, jazzy spin on some of my favorites - so much so that they've actually outdone the originals (in my opinion). A must-have for any Christmas mix. If you want to download individual songs, Baby, It's Cold Outside, Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree, and The Christmas Waltz are my favorites.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|this app is really fun.  I love it!  get path of the jedi it's worth 2.00! this app rocks! You won't. regret. getting IT!
B00127RAJY|4.0|Don't believe the hype - you CAN do this video! The video features both advanced and simplified versions of most of the exercises, and if you follow the timeline, you really can work your way up to the advanced workout. I wish it had better music, but they wouldn't be able to sell it at this price if they had to license anything worth listening to.<br /><br />The best tip I can offer is DO NOT give up! Each workout is broken down into three parts. When you finish the first part, you will not know how you can do it two more time. That's okay. You'll figure it out, and by the time you get to the third round, you'll be able to power through. Start with the regular moves and step down to the simpler modifications if you need to.
B007HACDLK|1.0|This book was not up to the usual exciting story we are used to from Vince Flynn. Not many can have all their books rate the same high marks. So I am looking forward to his next book and we will see if the well has run dry.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|More more do you want?  This movie is a rite of passage for any person that goes to the movies.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I love revenge, putting it on my kindle was great. It is really nice to see your favorite show where ever you are at.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|My kids love their songs.  it's a hit among the young girls in her school and the subdivision we live.
B007N9FKCY|5.0|Who knew a Mexican Jumpimg Bean could be so fun. If you love the old school 16 bit games like Sonic and Super Mario Bros, you are going to love this game.  Very well done and very fun for all ages.
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|Good children's plot, although I bet it's a bit scarey for many younger kids.  But still cute any funny for all ages. Great animation. I would watch it again.
B0090X4GLW|4.0|This soundtrack is fantastic, as is the film, but the soundtrack is unfortunately missing the song from one of my favourite moments in the movie - the shower duet of Titanium is NOT on this soundtrack-- a huge shame as it is an amazing version of the song.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|This is a fabulous Grand Piano.  I love the splendid tone and tune quality of this wondeful little convenient piano.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Excellent! As always funny, comical, action, & playful romantic teasing. For any who like mysteries & murder. Best season yet.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|As always, Tom Clancy comes through with lots of exciting adventure with excellent twists and turns of events including lots of amazing surprises.
B0088EDMMS|4.0|liked the movie and wanted to upgrade it to blue ray. So now I have to type in more words so I can submit this.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin is way above average, super extraordinary excellent writer.  I am still reading the book with great enthusiasm.  Everything from people to descriptions of events and scenes really captures that era in a very informative picturesqe manner.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|The story was good and the action sequences were well paced. It didn't feel like the plot was thrown in between stuff blowing up. I didn't mind the ending, even though a lot of other reviewers did't like it. It's worth a rental on the plane for sure.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This is a wonderful Grand Piano with all octives included.  The quality of tuning is excellent.  Love playing songs on this piano.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I just rented the movie on Amazon Instant Video. I've watched about 1/2 hour of the movie and I stopped.  It's not funny.  The language is foul and the jokes are crude.  I think it would appeal to some Jr. High students - the kind that laugh at jokes simply because they're laced with a lot of foul language.  The premise of the movie is creative, but it's a shame that the writer had to go with the typical, sarcastic \\"comedy\\" with a ton of expletives thrown in.  I take my comedy seriously and really admire someone who can make me laugh without depending on foul humor.  I paid to rent the movie and lost my money on this one.
B004I744AS|5.0|there is not a thing about this app I don't like. fun great games and all right in your pocket.  what could be better.
B00866H7SS|3.0|It is such a pity that this book has come out at the same time as the &#34; Fifty Shades Series &#34; The Story line is exactly the same, and one tends to get bored half way through.That is, if you are a &#34; Fifty Fan &#34; I did not down load the next book. I think I will wait a year or two till I attempt it again.<br />But if you have not read the '' Fifty Shades ' and you enjoy a raunchy book, I would highly recommend it, since the writting, as they say is a tad better....<br />If Sylvia had only published this book earlier, it would also be made into a movie. ;)
B0031KE9C6|5.0|Love this series so much.  It's a sassier and more intelligent brand of young female detective.  Kristen Bell plays a breath of fresh air among so many sappy, vapid female heroines on TV.  And she's also kinda hilarious.
B0014D6PCO|4.0|Great Movie.  The Christopher Nolan trilogy is one of my favorites.  I had to watch this one again after I watched The Dark Knight Rises.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I was excited that he finally made a Christmas album and was not dissapointed! Run to get your copy! His voice is great as always. No flashy changes to the music, just great songs.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This is quite possibly my favorite movie ever done by disney.  Not only is the heroine a lot stronger of a role model for young girls, but the artists have FINALLY figured out how to make their horses look real!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I've been using this app for a while to edit as opposed to the stock editor or another 3rd party app. This app has tons of filters and things to do to make your picture look pretty amazing. Only drawback is it creates a lot of cached memory. But can be easily cleared.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|THE BEST THING EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!it works great!!!even. if you fall.asleep with music on it still goes off.I.love the snooze you can personlize it.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|My only complaint is that it's only available as a single, they don't have it on the Skyfall soundtrack! Still great though.
B00A0R42L6|3.0|This one just wasn't as funny as the rest. I love this movie series and enjoy watching them with my children, this one just lacked the usual humor that I enjoy in these movies.
B000LQJS4W|2.0|I was disappointed with this purchase.  Nowhere on the description did it state that this was not the complete book...it was a simplified version.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The third book picked up a little more I think after the second. Didn't end the way I expected either. Definitally good, though.
B00AA36RZY|4.0|This book uses humor to make the design paterns easy to read and remember.  I recommend it to anyone who may have forgotten some patterns from college and wanted a refresher.
B006LSZECO|2.0|It took me forever to get through this book. It was a different type of read, but didn't pick up until over half way though it. Not upset I bought it, but wouldn't recommend it.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Surprisingly I am new to Castle and order the past seasons and I LOVE LOVE this show. Can't get enought!!!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The second book was a little more drug out, but still not a bad read. The hot and heaviness of the book became a little redundant.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|This has been my favorite movie for many years. It was time to upgrade from VHS to DVD! Great feel good movie with lots of cheeky comedy.
0345803485|4.0|Very good read. Romance isn't really my favorite, but James did good keeping it interesting! It was hard for me to put this down.
B003L77GG0|5.0|I am so glad that I have all the seasons of smallville, I have enjoyed this TV series. I always look forward to the next one.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Not my usual book, but the hype or it made me curious, and I wasn't disappointed. I would definitally recommend it.
B008K6DU4Y|1.0|Does not handle .wma files on the Kindle Fire. Does not work well on my Kindle Fire. Very disappointing. Will delete
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Safe Haven is definitally not Nicholas Sparks BEST, but still a good read none the less. I would still recommend it.
B009NPLIFE|5.0|I love this show.  They playback was ok, i did have to refresh it a couple of times but that may have been my computer.
B007OLYQ4E|5.0|I am quite glad I read the book to see where the spirit of Miss Holly Golightly originated.  While it is a whole different time period (1940s versus 1960s), the foundation remains.  Plus, I always enjoy Truman Capote's writing. Fun book.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  My only problem with the movie is that I was expecting ridiculous action and way over the top scenes and it took too long for that to happen. However, the last 45 minutes of the movie was exactly what I was looking for in this movie and I loved it.<br /><br />From a more serious perspective, I did like how the vampire hunter story of Lincoln was blended with his real world life. The story telling approach was similar in some ways to the way the main story of Assassins Creed 3 was told.  Most everyone knows the history the movie/game was based on, but there are a lot of back stories that were never told or still remain a mystery and this movie explained the behind the scenes of Abraham Lincoln in a fun and creative way.
B009QW7HMC|5.0|Simply the greatest series I have ever watched bar none! It is addicting in its extreme realism. You feel like you are there with them. Great acting from the entire cast. Not for the faint of heart, but if your into realistic survival in a world gone mad this is for you! It is the story of people who are helping them selves and each other cling to life knowing one bite or their death will bring them back as one of THEM!
B007HACDLK|4.0|I enjoy all of the books written by Vince Flynn.  Every time I read one I feel I'm reading the headlines.  I'm convinced the stories are more fact than fiction.<br />I will always read books by Vince Flynn and David Baldacci.  They are in a class by themselves.<br />I love the political intrigue that always dictates the action.<br />The book won't disappoint.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|I thought it would be another &#34;bubble pop&#34; clone, but I really like the sound effects and responsiveness of the game.
B009JBZH54|5.0|If your reading reviews then you are considering it and you should buy it. The price is great and the movie set is very nice and looks good on the shelf.  Enough said.
B004UFEJVW|5.0|UP has a full range of emotions and as an adult I would say this movie is entertaining. I'd recommend it with caution to those who sadden easily. The talking dogs are hilarious.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am addicted to Pinterest. I have found many tips and new recipes to try.  Not all recipes work out like the pictures show, but most do.
B00A0SQBDM|1.0|Game has started over twice after spending hours going through the story.  Each time it tells me my name is corrupt and starts over automatically. Don't waste your money.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|At first the lead in was a little drawn out but once you get into the book more it helps you to understand better because of the way he writes. Right now I am at about chapter 90 and the reading is pretty good and it is holding my interest better.
B007HO392S|5.0|Carrie sure has changed since her days on Idol. She has really grownup.<br />Love the new CD. Bought it before vacation so we could listen to is on the way.<br />Great entertainment.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|the way she tells you everything is like you can see it. I recomment every body that want to have a good time reading
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Realy! The Piano Guys have this knack of presenting music in all forms in such a way as to make you swoon. Talent, arrangemnt and presentation are just the beginnings of each and every track. These Guys just make great music. You will find a taste of everything here. It's simply Gourmet for the heart and soul.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A book you will be shocked over and dumbfounded about. It's hard to put down, but AMAZINGLY worth it!! A must read.
B009CCBCU4|5.0|﻿Every so often a book comes along that pulls you so deeply into its world that you experience a<br />sort of culture shock when you return to your own world.  This is one of those books.<br /><br />The book is set in ancient Mesoamerica during a time of impending war and political strife.  The<br />author seamlessly merges her story with actual historical events of the time.  The story revolves<br />around two young men who should be on opposite sides of the coming conflict, but whose strong<br />friendship transcends the intrigues swirling around them.  Her characters are three-dimensional<br />and you find yourself hoping they will find a way to pull themselves out of what appears to be an<br />inevitable conflict.<br /><br />Author Zoe Saadia expertly brings to life the brilliant world of Mesoamerica, providing rich<br />details about the culture and physical world of its people, all without being intrusive.<br /><br />If you are interested at all in reading a great book in an unusual setting, please try this book.<br />You will not regret it.<br /><br />The Highlander is the first of a series entitled “The Rise of the Aztecs.”  I am looking forward to<br />reading many more offerings by this great author.
B00004Z400|5.0|I've been looking for this disk forever!  Arrived in great condition.  Now I must go to enjoy each awesomely made song.
0425263916|5.0|This book was awesome.  I loved the drama in it and I nearly screamed at the end of the book!
B004X4R49Y|5.0|The King's Speech is a great movie with great actors- I highly recommend it!! Colin firth is amazing and Geoffery Rush!! THeir on screen performanceis spot on!!
034580404X|5.0|I read all of them so fast and it was very hard to put down.  Can't wait until the movie comes out!
B001NLKWLW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. My favorite book as a child was the \\"Secret Garden\\" and while this didn't quite measure up to that it was an excellent book with a good mystery. I will probably try and read more books by this authoress.
0446547654|5.0|I love all of Nicholas Sparks' books.  There has not been a bad book.  The movie is going to be great!
B00284BMBM|4.0|Very good follow up to his debut but this sophomore disc is not a stand out like the first one.  I still enjoy listening to it though.
1476712042|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I could not put it down and I was so nervous about the events taking place.
B008133MDK|5.0|Great show, you think about it long after you finish watching it. Good acting and directing. Highly recommend it to anyone.
0425263908|5.0|This book was amazing.  I could not wait to read Reflected in You and I have already pre-ordered the next one!
B0098VXE50|5.0|This was a eye catching movie.  The weaving of opulent and filth, youth and age, love and power.<br />Story telling at a breath taking level.  Can not wait to see it again,  that said I don't often watch movies again the same year.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|this is the worst most difficult complicated progrm ever. I just want to download some music into my desktop. will never purchase music from here again. terrible.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I have enjoyed all of the dark knight films so I felt it was best to purchase the trilogy. This collection comes with enough content to satisfy most people so I felt it was good enough. All of the Blu-ray disc played fine on my PS3 as I heard some people were having problems. The dark knight trilogy is a great choice for fans who are not die hard But in a different case you should wait for the Ultimate edition whenever that comes out.
B004ZGI2KK|4.0|I was not expecting this to be as enjoyable as it was...very pleasantly surprised!  I love a good fantasy or horror story, but I do not like a lot of blood and gory stuff .  This movie had some blood, but not bad and the movie was entertaining and suspenseful. a good retelling of the old faerie tale
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I would have to say that this set is definitely a steal for the price they were asking.... The movies themselves were really good and I love the old school special effects....when people actually had to physically be creative without using a computer....
B007XIC1GI|4.0|Like a car wreck, I couldn't look away from this book.  After playing music in bars in my  younger days, I realized my life was pretty normal compared to this.

B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly has not disappointed this reader with The Black  Box.  I have come to expect a complicated plot with complex story characters which are found in this latest Bosch novel.  You will become excited when you remember you have not finished The Black Box on your way to bed.
B00395ZYVS|2.0|I read this for a book club and was excited to start after having seen some of the reviews.  I was really disappointed!  I found the characters to be totally lacking any depth I didn't connect to any of them at all.  The story line was pretty predictable but it was an easy read and it didn't take too long!  Would have been fine for a holiday quick read but not one I will be keeping or passing on to others.
B006FE83UE|5.0|My dad had introduced this movie to my sister and I when we were little. We had watched this movie so much that we soon started to say lines from it. When it was shown in theatres recently we went to go see it. Gregory Peck always reminded us of our dad. So wise and knowledgable. He always knew how to explain things so you could understand. This was one of Peck's best if not the best movies of his career.
B007TK77QE|5.0|I want to say that I really liked this book but I am not sure that like is quite the right word considering how despicable so many of the characters are!!!  It had me coming back for more though which for me is a sign of a good read.<br />I had read several reviews of the book before I read it - which I probably wouldn't have read if it wasn't for book club but I am so glad I did.  I do agree with several other reviewers about the number of characters, there really are a lot and I found that reading it on the kindle rather than hard copy meant that I wasn't able to easily flick back a chapter or two to remember connections between characters.  For a while I wished I had made some notes but as you get to know the characters it is easier to remember them.<br />Coming from a relatively small village myself, I felt like I actually knew most of the characters.  At times I felt like there was an overload of big words and the dictionary came out a few times while reading it.<br />Overall I was surprised how much I enjoyed the book considering the other reviews I had read and next time I won't be so quick to judge a book based on opinions of people I don't know!
1419705849|5.0|Again, another item mentioned for my son.  You really can't go wrong with Jeff Kinney, my son has all of the &#34;Diary of a Wimpy Kid&#34; books, so this is just an addition to his collection.

B005LAII08|5.0|Disney appears to be doing everything right when it comes to civil rights. It has certainly been a long way. Their animated films reflect racial diversity without being patronizing or offensive, with good values. \\"Brave\\" is an exciting and delightful film that follows this pattern, addressing the at-times-neglected role of women in society, showing an empowered and determined young lady that defies good ol' boy traditions. And it does it in an intelligent and colorful way.<br /><br />The story takes place in Scotland, where King Fergus rules the Clan DunBroch. The king gives Merida, his young daughter, a bow for her birthday. With time, Merida becomes an expert archer, a beautiful teenager, and lives a happy life with her three identical triplets. It is at this time that her mother, Queen Elinor, tells her that she is to be engaged for marriage to one of the sons of the leaders of his father's allied Clan kings. Merida, who has a strong and determined character - independent and opinionated -, hates the idea and does everything that she can to avoid this task, which means breaking a holy tradition. In doing so, she hurts her mother, by asking a witch to transform her into a bear. Merida, of course, feels sorry that she made that choice, and, against time, tries to reverse the spell. Add to this the curse of the legendary Mor'du, a huge, mean black bear, who is feared by all, and who was once a handsome prince. All these problems will make Merida reexamine her actions and behavior, and her future in the kingdom.<br /><br />\\"Brave\\" has all the technical goodies of any Pixar films, and it is just great to watch. It is also funny, wicked and charming. And, as I said, it is about women's empowerment and bravery. The Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, DVD and Digital Copy edition is loaded with extras, such as extended scenes, Pixar shorts, alternate opening, art galleries, audio commentaries, and much more!

Regarding the complaints for dings on boxes and shipping problems. Life is too short to bicker on these unimportant issues. Enjoy the music and the record that takes you back in time when life was simple. My set was perfect played all of them after reading the reviews.

B00867GJYK|5.0|Many are the great animated films that the Disney-Pixar partnership has produced and remain popular to this day. However, for yours truly the one that is a sentimental favorite is, without a doubt, the very colorful and fun \\"Finding Nemo,\\" which was released in 2003, and deservedly won an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Now, this precious movie is available in a fantastic Blu-ray plus DVD edition.<br /><br />The film starts with Marlin and Coral, a husband and wife pair of clown fishes at Australia's Great Barrier Reef, enjoying the imminent birth of their children, which, at the time, are just a clutch of eggs. However, tragedy strikes, and only Marlin and one, lonely egg survives. That surviving egg happens to be Nemo. We then move to the days in which Nemo is now a young, playful and happy clownfish. Unfortunately, due to a disagreement with his father, Nemo swims away and is caught by some scuba divers. He is taken away to Sidney, where they find a new \\"home\\" at a fish tank in a dentist's office. Marlin, of course, wants his son back and, for his luck, is able to find a clue about Nemo's whereabouts. He then embarks on a recue mission with Dory, a Regal Blue Tang, as his companion. On his way to Sidney, they will find all kinds of obstacles, including being engulfed by a whale, almost being stung by jellyfish, and of, course, as we can see in the movie's posters, surviving shark attacks. Nemo, on the other hand, makes friends with the other fishes in the tank, where they call themselves the \\"Tank Gang,\\" while trying to escape, too.<br /><br />In addition to winning an Academy Award, \\"Finding Nemo\\" was also, as of 2006, the best selling DVD of all time. The majestic Blu-ray version of this popular film includes the movie and some bonus materials in Disc one, additional bonus features in disc two, and the DVD edition on disc three. Some of the extras include filmmakers' discussions, outtakes and deleted scenes, theatrical shorts, aquariums, and much more!This is a perfect Christmas gift for all family.

B008SVS3FC|5.0|This is the latest C.D. of John Hiatt and it doesn't disappoint. He seems a little more introspective on this recording but, he still comes up with great songs. He starts off with \\"We're alright now\\" an up beat celebration of his love relationship, to the last song \\"Blues can't even find me\\" where he laments about how his life is going. In between are songs of loves lost and self awareness. I'm a true fan of John Hiatt and hope that people who like good music will give him a try. My collection includes \\"The Same old man\\", \\"The Tiki Bar is Open\\",\\"The Open Road\\",  \\"Dirty Jeans and Mudslides\\" and of cause \\"Mystic Pinball\\".

I've always loved her recording of Dirty(I have the video on my Zune mp3 player)but never got the Stripped c.d. A friend asked me \\"were have you been it's a classic\\". So I got it  from Amazon and I was glad I did. Even though the c.d. is almost 10 years old it still holds up. It's a combination of female songs of  empowerment and learning to stand up for yourself all rapped in great rhythmic beats and out standing vocals. The cover shows Christina in her Salad Days and that alone is worth a look at. It's a classic that should be in everyones music collection.  Savoy Blue

B009X01C64|5.0|This is a very nice looking case, and should protect my Kindle device quite well. In my original review, I said that the use of this case as a stand was not very satisfactory. Well, this was lack of thoroughness on my part. I had not taken the time to learn to use this feature properly. Now that I have done so, I realize the error of my ways, and would have difficulty finding fault with this product. I also originally stated that it was hard to get the Kindle in and out of the case, which has a metal housing for the device. While this is true, it only serves to add to the overall stability of the case. Now that it is installed, and I've learned how to use it correctly, I don't anticipate any reason to take it out again in the near future. I originally rated this case with 3 stars, at this time, I have bumped it up to 5.

B000SEGUDE|1.0|I was very excited to get Cloud Atlas for my Kindle. Dived right in and loved the first third of the book. Extraordinary writing; Mitchell was weaving a spellbinding tale. Then I hit \\"the wall\\" with the chapter on Sonmi.  The book turned toward preachiness and difficult-to-follow language and structure. I saw where it was going so I slogged through the chapter hoping for better. The next chapter was worse, mega-preachy and really hard to follow. It was like Mitchell put down a challenge to readers to get through it, and while he was at it bludgeoned us with stuff that made me feel like I was sitting through a basic, and boring, philosophy class. I skimmed that chapter, then gave up. Made it about halfway through, but by that time I didn't care how it ended. Sorry Mr. Mitchell.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|I really enjoyed this film.  I saw it in the theater after it was first released but waited to review it here until I got and watched the Blu-Ray, like you're supposed to.  (This section is for product reviews, not movie reviews)<br /><br />To me, Christopher Nolan's Batman films are the best.  Tim Burton's Batman showed us that comic movies could be serious, but then the series went downhill in the sequels.  Nolan took us back to the beginning in Batman Begins, gave us a nice middle with The Dark Knight, and ends things nicely with this film.  The story is very good, it tells the tale of an aging Bruce Wayne living with the physical and mental consequences of his life as Batman in a city where Batman is no longer necessary.  However, that all changes when Bane comes to town and then Bruce must once more put on the bat suit and face the one enemy who is at least his physical match, if not more. The acting is great, what you expect from the actors involved.  The characters are believable and the film has a very realistic look to it because most of it is real.  Unlike a lot of movies being made today, this film uses CGI only when there's no other way to make something happen.  However, 90 to 95 percent of what you see is stuff that they actually filmed.  To me, that makes the film even better.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray is a very nice product.  The film is in the highest quality and is on its own disc.  The only thing I don't like is that, when you hit stop, you can't resume the film.  Also, there is no bookmark function.  So, if you turn off your player, you lose where you are in the film.  The film also has long chapters, there are only 17 chapter on a 2 hour 44 minute film.  I expected more from a 2012 Blu-Ray.  But, those are my only complaints and they're minor.  The special features disc is nice, there are a lot of good things on there.  I especially like the documentary on the Batmobiles.  The DVD copy was unnecessary to me.  I'm single, I have 1 TV and I have my Blu-Ray player hooked up to it, so there's no point in me ever watching the DVD.  But, I couldn't buy the Blu-Ray without it.  So, I gave the DVD to my parents.  They enjoyed it and now don't have to buy the DVD, so that worked out nicely for everyone except Warner Brothers.lu-Ray player hooked up to it, so there's no point in me ever watching the DVD.

B004LWZWGA|3.0|I re-watched the first two movies after I saw this one.  The first was something we just hadn't seen in live movie form before, taking us back to the Keaton-type portrayal and delivery, but adding so much more with the early story -- we were blown away and craving more.<br /><br />Then the second one hit us, and I have now watched it more than 7 times (loser!) and it still gives me chills.  The story is one of the best of all time, and the characters (all of them, it seems) rise to the occasion.  You can almost find yourself rooting for the Joker at times, or understanding his perspective at the very least, and Harvey's \\"fall\\" is like ancient Greek drama brought to our modern way of understanding.  Amazing movie, easily one of the best ever.<br /><br />Then I saw the third and 'final' chapter, and with all due respect, I walked away feeling like it was a real disappointment.  I mean, taken on its own merits, it was an okay action flick (at times), but the story itself was just so-so and seemed very drawn out.  There were moments where I actually found myself thinking, when is this going to get \\"somewhere\\", let alone to the finale?  It had its moments, but they were few and far between, and the film never came close to making me feel the raw energy and emotion (and thought-provoking scenes and speeches) of the second film.  I dunno, maybe the second film just cast too big a shadow, because the third film really seemed kind of cookie-cutter in places.  Sorry, that's just how I feel -- but you'd still want to see it at least once if you loved the series so far.  I just wouldn't buy it to own...

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love the Hunger Games trilogy! The story is thought-provoking, entertaining, and a quick read. Suzanne Collins didn't take the easy way out with her story line, and though I wish the ending might have been a bit different, I respect her for the way she ended the story (which wasn't a horrible ending, anyway). I personally do not like all the violent descriptions of murder and mayhem in the story, but understand their part in the story, and feel that for the most part such descriptions were done tastefully. But overall, I love the story and characters and think this is one awesome series!
B000I186FW|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies. Everything was great in this movie from the script, to the acting and especially the action.

B0097JYVAU|3.0|I thought the first chapter was great. The failure of rating agencies to appreciate that risk could be correlated hit the nail on the head. But after that chapter I couldn't maintain attention. The tangents and palaver were beyond annoying. This is a book that could have been condensed by more than 50% if the author went straight to the point; i.e. it contained too much noise.<br /><br />The greatest failing was his chapter on climate change. He made a few good points about the futility of political rhetoric. But many of the questions he raised petered off without conclusion and to be true to the principles laid out in the first chapter, he should have demonstrated greater skepticism than he did.

A few of the highlights for me are:<br />-The World is Ahead<br />-Radagast the Brown<br />- Dreaming of Bag End<br />- Erebor<br />I loved every track in this set with the exception of the last song by Neil Finn, just didn't care for it but one track can't take away from an otherwise incredible soundtrack.<br /><br />This is a must buy, over two hours of beautiful music that will transport you into another world.
B00886XQO0|2.0|Mainly bought these to improve call of duty gameplay.<br />even when set to proper settings they didnt help whatsoever, didnt improve hearing footsteps or anythign of the sort.<br />also a real pain, have to use the connector piece for the xbox controller and it likes to cut itself off.<br />not to mention pairing the headset and the bluetooth connector is a pain, its rather easy step wise, however it does not want to work half the time, waste of money would advise not buying these.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I'm generally not a sci-fi reader, but nevertheless , I bought this book and just couldn't put it down. If your looking for a thriller this is the one!
B009SSGBOE|5.0|Supurb musicianship.  This album sounds as good as Steely Dan in the 70's. Fagen is a true modern day musical master.
B001XUPF2O|5.0|I already knew I loved this movie. Huge fan of the whole trilogy.  Too bad it's come to an end.
B003O86FMW|4.0|As in most multibook series the inrensity of the new idea begins to wear off during further episodes, but this book still is easy reading and kept my interest enabling me to complete it in about a day and a half.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Angry Birds seems like it should get old fast, but these expansions they keep releasing keep it fresh. If you've enjoyed any of the other games, you'll like this one.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Finished this book again it 2 days.  This book strated to lose the intensity of my interest because I already was questioning District 13 in my mind so pretty well had the ending in my head before I reached it.  Overall trhe series was very good.  Mockingjay is an excellent book, but the Hunger Gasmes was the best.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Well shame on me for not checking into this movie more before renting it, but made through about 15-20 minutes of this movie and just turned it off.  Sophmoric, boring attempts at humor, etc., etc.  Take Family Guy dad and substitute Teddy Bear for his character and bunch of real humans instead of the other characters, then a script that is too long and brainless for even a Family Guy episode and your mind immediately starts thinking about all the other things you could be doing besides watching this lame movie.  You're better of watching a movie you like even if you have seen it 20 times.
B008BM9L72|5.0|I have read this books over and over again.......and I dream about Christian with my eyes open.  E L James you gave me hope......THIS IS THE BEST LOVE STORY I HAVE READ IN MY WHOLE LIFE........
B001CTDH76|5.0|Now, I am ordering the first season for all my really close friends.  Great escapism in these times is hard to find, but this show really does it for me.  It banishes my blues and makes me smile and laugh out loud.  I can't imagine a better actor for the role than Simon Baker.  He sparkles and dazzles and brings all his great Aussie values to the fore.  Love this show.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|Excellent book for those who are working and looking for a change, to make a pause and see another way of keeping things working.
B007N9FKCY|5.0|If you like old school 16bit side scrollers from the SNES days then you will like this game. I had been wanting to buy this game for awhile but just havent been able too. This is probably the best FAOTD i have seen to date.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This may be the hardest movie review I've ever written, somehow words don't<br />express it quite right ...<br /><br />To begin, I saw Life of Pi in 3-D. A week later I went back and saw it again,<br />because I don't foresee having another chance. I expect the color and detail<br />will remain gorgeous in 2-D, and I definitely intend to buy the disc.<br /><br />However the 3-D in this movie is spectacular. The tiger, Richard Parker, is<br />at the top of the list, but in fact the entire movie benefits tremendously<br />from 3-D. If you liked Avatar, you probably liked the marvelous animals.<br />And I'm sure in some scenes, Richard Parker is CGI'd to some extent. But<br />Life of Pi has a real earthly animal to work with, and you can argue there<br />is no animal on earth more beautiful or fierce than a tiger. That's part<br />of the genius of this movie, and I'm sure one reason James Cameron liked<br />it so much.<br /><br />That brings me to another point about this movie, its suitability for kids.<br />Hopefully by now you understand the tiger is not a cuddly pet. Its very much<br />a wild animal, just like you can see in nature videos. Except in this movie<br />the tiger is a lot closer. He wants to eat Pi. Pi can't always see the tiger.<br />The audience knows the tiger is going to try something, but that just makes it<br />all the more nerve-wracking. Or exciting, depending on the person watching.<br />This movie made me jump several times, and I was often clutching the arms of<br />my chair. Its pretty intense in places. More so the second time I saw it.<br />I kid you not.<br /><br />\\"Tiger, tiger, burning bright<br />In the darkness of the night\\"<br />  - William Blake<br /><br />\\"Tell me what you see\\"<br />  - Pi<br /><br />Regarding the story, I will say the movie starts out to establish what kind<br />of a kid Pi was when he was growing up in India. This helps us know Pi as a<br />multi-dimensional character. But the beauty of this part of the movie is<br />the kind you can see every day, not the visionary beauty that comes later.<br />Maybe it takes more effort to see it, because its a little too much like our<br />own lives when we were kids. Growing up can seem mundane. But sometimes<br />it can also be dangerous. Or heartbreaking.<br /><br />Once the movie shifts to the ocean, its very easy to believe that now we<br />have our arms around the story. But Life of Pi is one of those movies where<br />we don't really know the story at all, until the last word of dialog has<br />been spoken. There's more than one story here, and most of what makes you<br />think, after its over, comes at the very end. You have to pay attention to<br />pick it all up. On disc, you may want to re-play a few seconds at the end<br />of the movie.<br /><br />Its worth it. If you like to think about a movie, if you have a vivid memory<br />for beauty, then Life of Pi is one of the easiest movies to recommend. Its the<br />second masterpiece of 2012.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|The best ever television series that should never have been cancelled.  Fox cancelled Firefly, I cancelled EVER watching Fox again.  Wonderful story, wonderful characters and the perfect actors playing them-what more could anyone want?  Just one thing-for it to still be on tv!
B009NPA3MS|4.0|Love it , Iam sure he will have a long  run in the music business.  Already looking forward to the next cd
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Listen more than once...<br /><br />You cannot appreciate Steely Dan / Donald Fagen music to its fullest after just one listen.  A lot of work always goes into Donald Fagen's music.  This time, he had the help of Michael Leonhart not only performing, but arranging and producing.  The horns, in particular, are tight - yet very smooth.  On the whole, this collection of tunes really grooves - my favorite track being &#34;Miss Marlene&#34;.<br /><br />If you have enjoyed Steely Dan albums and Donald Fagen's prior offerings, this is one you should definitely check out.<br /><br />Tom
B009X01C64|4.0|I had a little bit of a problem with reviewing this case. I had hoped that Santa would bring me a Kindle HD 8.9, but after me gifting \\"Santa\\" with a fairly expensive present, she didn't seem forthcoming with a present in return. So you can see that I couldn't describe this case properly if I had a pair of socks.<br /><br />Luckily, Santa decided that I should get my present early. I've had the Kindle for about a week now, and I'm really enjoying it. When it came I put it in the case immediately, just like my original Kindle. I didn't want my new toy to fall on the floor and maybe become damaged. As I used the case I became aware of it being of good quality, better than I expected.<br /><br />The case can also be used as a stand, although it's not quite so much of a success. It's a little difficult to get the angled Kindle to stay in place. I also tried turning it from horizontal to vertical alignment, and it seemed a bit stiff, although I'm sure it will become easier with time. The case holds the Kindle very securely.<br /><br />One other feature that I'd like to see is some sort of storage for my stylus. I'm a newbie to touchscreens, and it's very easy to make the Kindle do something different to what you intend. If there is no storage, then it will be nice to have some sort of leash so that the stylus doesn't roll away.<br /><br />But these are minor niggles, which don't really concern me, and if I had to buy another Kindle case I'd definitely consider this one. The design is well thought out, so you don't have to dig around for the on/off switch, or have to remove the Kindle to plug in the recharging cable. The case looks very businesslike in its black fake leather.<br /><br />So if you've got a new Kindle from Santa, protect it in a decent case like this one.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|i love it!!! a little more showy then the first play, but still enjoyable. it is well worth the money.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This series was recommended by a friend.  The story was captivating and I was sad when it was over. I will be buying more of this series.
0896898288|5.0|I bought it as a gift for a friend, but am going to order it for myself! It's just marvelous.  Many of us who quilt have a soft spot in our hearts for those women who came before with needle in hand to provide warmth and comfort for those they cared about.  I'm one of those people, and particularly for those women who ran rural households and quilted in their very limited &#34;spare&#34; time.<br /><br />For many years, I visited with a relative who subscribed to Farm Life Magazine, and when I saw that this book was based on The Farmer's Wife, a similar mag from the 1920s, I was smitten already.  What arrived was a beautifully illustrated book, half short letters from farm wives of the period, and half more than 100 blocks inspired by the letters.<br /><br />The letters are poignant, interesting, and give a real insight to a time when as a country we were exploding with innovation and farming was seen, especially for women, as a drudge of a choice.  These letters reveal the soul of women who find comfort in a rural living situation, who see themselves in a far brighter environment than that by which they are perceived.  It was a warm fuzzy to read the letters.<br /><br />Each page is decorated with a quilt block, many not commonly seen any longer.  There's an attached CD I didn't open (it is a gift, after all).  The cover says it has 106 piecing templates. The back half of the book includes block assembly directions for the blocks, more than 100 of them.  The templates are referenced in the assembly directions.  Some of these aren't blocks for beginners, but all of them are do-able, and all are lovely.<br /><br />The book is soft-bound, which means it might loosen a bit if one is pressing it open too often (as I'm inclined to do with quilt books).  It's 256 pages.  The artwork is some of the nicest I've ever seen in a quilting book.  I'd recommend The Farmer's Wife Sample Quilt to anybody looking for an insight into early 20th century rural life, the role of rural women, and of course, their quilts.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Book 2 takes one even further into this historical era. Much enjoyable. Not sure it could be fully enjoyed without first reading The Fall of the Giants (Book 1)
B006LSZECO|4.0|Mystery-drama books usually aren't my cup of tea, but this book was great! It kept me turning the pages all the way through it. I would definately agree with many of the other reviews that say the ending is a HUGE disappointment! Seems like Miss Flynn ran out of inspriation over the last couple chapters. The book was so suspensful and then it just teatered off right up to the last page. If the ending would have matched the rest of her writing throughout the book I would have awarded it 5 Stars.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I admit, I have not read these books. And I shall indeed change that. But how could I pass up watching this film? A strong central character, surpassing the odds, without being cheesy or overly emotional is a fine thing. You come to love the characters for their flaws, becoming as political and scheming despite their district's state of affairs to tangle with the leadership of the nation. I will read these novels, and look forward to the next installment.
B002XUL6RG|4.0|HUNGER'S SUCCESS LEANED ON MCQUEEN'S GREAT STORY AND FASSBINDER'S PREFORMANCE, WITH WHICH THE FILM WILL BE TASTELESS, AND NOTHING MORE THAN A BLOODY HISTORIAL EVENT.<br /><br />CRITERION'S BLU-RAY IS GREAT, BUT IT SEEMED PLAIN STTANDING WITH OTHER UNEXPECTED BLU-RAY EDITIONS.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an excellently implemented app. I really like it. However I wish there was a larger selection of serif fonts:=) I highly recommend this app! It is very user-friendly
B007V65R54|5.0|Not only is it revealing methodologically, but it cites data that is truly eye-opening.  For example, it wasn't<br />the bad loans that drove the recent financial calamity, but the over-leveraged betting on speculative investments<br />such as the $80 trillion of credit default swaps/derivatives.<br /><br />A must read.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I read this book as a vacation book , and it did keep me interested . It was a good story , but for some reason I wasnt thrilled with how it ended .. Not that I think that it should have had a different ending , but the writing kind of just stopped , where you turn the page looking for more . It was a good read , not GREAT
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book is a must read.  I have read all the other books by this author and they are great.  This book is hard to put down.<br />Whatever you think you figured out believe is the secret  you have know idea until the very end.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|If a book is great you do not want to put it down . This book was interesting as I like to learn about the holocaust . I had good visuals while reading it , which was a good thing . I ended up putting the book down and reading another in between and then going back to it . But all in all it was an ok book .
0812979702|5.0|I am currently reading this book.  The early chapters and topics have been helpful - remain interested in the author and his concepts.
B002C949AE|4.0|This was an interesting book , because I learned a lot about another culture. Some of it was a little disturbing as it should be for anyone that reads it . I thought it was an easy read  and glad I read it .
B0083SBMBM|5.0|My kids have watched this 20 times.  It is great.  It is clean and gets your patriot spirit going.  Love the way they all learn to work together.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Love what Rod Stewart can do to any song. He takes classic Christmas songs and makes them new again.Good job, Rod!
B000BJ7BCA|4.0|yes, it is far fetched, but it is clean, funny, and didn't any of you ever dream about becoming a super hero.  My kids and I like to watch it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game reminds me of cityville and similar games without being forced to spam friends. Energy refills pretty quickly so it's perfect for quick game breaks uwhen you're bored!
B005ES0YA4|5.0|Superior to Classic model, that is, better arch support, well wearing sole and comfortable enough to wear all day out of the box. But, runs a little small regards sizing. As with all Crocs the cavet, don't go out in public wearing these, ever :)
B00004YRQA|5.0|you need this to save games, duh. Just buy it already and fill it up. Still works after many, MANY years.
B0035OC7PO|5.0|I read this on a recent trip to Europe and could relate to many of the places Bryson describes.  It is absolutely hilarious in places and laugh out loud stuff.
B00006RCNW|4.0|I wish this show wouldn't have used the dirty filter it used. As a 4x3 capture it already won't work well on modern HDTVs but that filter makes it damn near impossible to watch now. Too bad, the show was great.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|Ellie Goulding's Halcyon is a great album. I think it is even better than Lights. I would definitely recommend it.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Just a good old fashioned Child book. I have now become aware of how good Mr. Child is. I can't get enough of  his books. Looking forward to his next book.
1439170916|5.0|This book is a real page turner. Beautiful language, very well written and organized, very easy to understand. When a subject discussed chapters earlier is brought up, the author weaves in a &#34; reminder&#34; so you're always up to date. I can't begin to say how much I learned in this book. None of us will escape cancer being a part of our lives or of someone we know. Reading this book will make you an educated decision maker if you are ever put in that unfortunate position. After reading it, articles about new advances will make much more sense. The author is nothing short of BRILLIANT !
B003NVN1C2|2.0|I watched it on a reference from a friend, but when I got to the end, it really wasn't worth the wait.  Kind of an interesting story, but it seems to just drag on and on feeling quite apocalyptically drab the whole time.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple and easy. Made perfect for kindle fire 7&quot; HD.  No need to look further.  And an excellent price! FREE!  You should charge soon!
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Unfortunately, clicking save after a (possibly lengthy) edit doesn't actually save the result anywhere (that I can find)... so until this gets fixed, if you have a Nexus, don't bother.
B007HACDLK|4.0|This is a good read. Flynn manages to give an up to date feeling about our involvement in Afghanistan, as well as a not too subtle feeling about the politics that affect the ongoing war. His hero Mitch Rapp has to clean up a mess which  involve not only our known enemies but also betrayal by our supposed friends and our own officials. The non stop action keeps the reader page turning until the final page.
B001992NUQ|5.0|This could be the best move ever.  It was the writers first major book and the movie although complicated is easier to follow than the book.  It has a great natural flow.  Good acting, good story, good dialogue, good directing, good sets, good soundtrack.  This movie is a must see guy movie.  I haven't found many girls that really like it for some reason.  Not sure why.
0385535147|3.0|Grisham can really spin a good yarn, and does so while intriguing the reader with legal nuances of which the reader is most likely unaware. As usual the writing is excellent. After reading all of Grisham's books you immediately look for the twist that is not obvious. Unfortunately the twist was readily apparent,&#34;everything is not what is seems, skim milk poses as cream&#34;. Even after figuring out the twist early in the book, how it is accomplished keeps the reader stuck to the pages. Although this book may not be Grisham's best, it is far better than most of the legal thrillers on the market.
1435237749|5.0|All 10 of these books are fantastic.  The first half of the first one is a bit slow but from there to the end of #10 it never stops.  Gaiman is a skillful wordsmith.  Loved it.
0345803493|5.0|Fifty shades darker was a wonderful read. The shipping was cheap and got here on time. Thank you. I've read all of these books and this one was one of my favorite.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I bought this used and it is like brand new!  I'm so excited to give it to my daughter on Christmas.  She is going to love it!
B008PZ69T8|5.0|I've never listened to a lot of classical music. This album is amazing. I love ever song and it brought peace in my life. Beautiful cd.
B00006EXDM|5.0|This was a collection he was so glad to receive because he is such a big Stones fan. This is a collection of their best early material. Highly recommended!
0345803507|5.0|Best book ever. I love the ending. It left me craving more of e. l. James. I joined her website and purchased the soundtrack to the triology. Amazing! Will change your life.
B00000272N|5.0|I ordered this cd cause i never heard the entire album just certain songs , and man it is awesome . The cd came in better condition than what was said it would be in so i was happy as hell.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Take it for what it is. . A fun love story with great twists and turns and places you've never imagined.
B000000OQY|5.0|This cd is the first one i have ever bought of this band on cd , i bought the cassette back when this album came out. I love it then and i still do , cd was in great condition and it came really fast.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book. I couldnt put it down til I had finished it. The author made me think about what it would be like to live in such a world.
B005V1WVPA|5.0|I am a huge fan of Korn and this was the las cd i needed for my collection of cd's, it came quick as hell and was in fantastic condition.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I was so surpriosed when I read the first book in this trilogy because I couldnt put it down and this third book completed the series with a satisfying ending. Yeah for Lizbeth and Michael.
B00004T9UF|5.0|I have been wanting to but this cd like forever, i heard it when it was new but never had the money for it. Well found it for a good price and it came in pristeen condition.
B004LWZWGA|3.0|The story line is very good but what distracted from the movie was the sound.  Dialogue is VERY hard to understand due to background noise/music.  Other than that, not bad; lots of action and you are able to follow the movie without much dialogue.
B00006690G|5.0|Well my ex has this cd and i liked it so i had to get my own, and found it at the right price.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|I enjoyed the slower pacing and character development vs. a mindless action packed CGI show. Overall very entertaining, my sisters who no nothing about Halo enjoyed.
B000RIHBIE|4.0|That is how many times i forgot to buy this cd till i finally saw it for the right price and got it. Great price and in even better condition.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|I've watched this movie many times and just wanted my own copy so I could enjoy it without commercials and also watch it whenever I wanted.
B002KREVCO|5.0|I am a huge AC/DC fan i am only missing certain cd's from them and this was one of them, i was happy as hell with this buy.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|having a lot of fin with this one.So far is not a money pit like other freemiums.  Graphics are excellent. as well.
B003ITDN86|5.0|I could not decide wether to buy this cd or not , well i saw the price and said hell yes, got it and man it was in near mint condition. I am so happy with this buy.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|All 3 of these books were amazing. Very well written. Not for anyone who does not have an open mind when it comes to sexuality.
B0061TQBRK|5.0|I got this as a present for my ex hope she likes it , i listened to it and man it is awesome.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I thought this book was really good. It is very well written and has such a touching story. Highly recommended!
B0000028UK|5.0|I had this cassette back when i was in the army and i used to listen to it all the time, it took me forever to order this cd and i don't know why? The cd came quickly and in great condition.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All 3 of these books were amazing. Very well written. Not for anyone who does not have an open mind when it comes to sexuality.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I am not a big fan of to much rap these days but Eminem is a welcome surprise, this cd came in great condition and it took a bit but it was well worht it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|All 3 of these books were amazing. Very well written. Not for anyone who does not have an open mind when it comes to sexuality.
B000JJRIN4|5.0|Iwas very surprised by the condition this cd came in, it was better than advertised. Great cd and even better buy.
B007N9FKCY|3.0|Anyways, it's an okay game if you're incredibly bored and waiting around, which is what tablet games are for.  Three out of five stars.
B005I4JG80|5.0|An enjoyable read that I keep referring back to as my partner and I prepare to enter the world of parenting. A welcome alternative to the American baby-crazed consumerism that I can't wait to put into practice.
B0021L9MJG|5.0|One of my favorites!! never gets old even when you know the lines word for word. And the music that lets you somethings about too happen.
B008FPZQRO|5.0|Great job on this classic. Sound quality is right on the money. Looking forward to the next couple of discs from ELP.
0446672653|5.0|If you've ever felt like &#34;something (or someone) is missing&#34; from your life then you might want to check this out, &#34;Only Love Is Real&#34; by Brian Weiss.  There are reasons for it ......
B006S009IY|5.0|I was so interested to see the man behind this marvelous children's story,yet I hoped Johnny Depp wouldn't get too odd, outrageous, over the top etc and somehow make this into a farce of sorts.<br />This movie was a heartwarming/heart wrenching beautifully acted story that I definitely enjoyed through tears at times.<br />The magic of imagination brought to life is something that with age we often forget how precious it is. This movie was a wonderful reminder for young and old to somewhere in your heart NEVER GROW UP!
034553154X|2.0|As a previous reviewer mentioned, the artwork is beautiful but several months are a little weird, and in my opinion not very tasteful for a calendar.  Big fan of the book series, as well as last years' calendar, however I don't know of many people who want hanging corpses on display in their homes.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|Volume buttons on sides don't work right.  Case is so tight it constantly adjusts them on its own.  When on the phone callers can't hear me or say I sound muffled.  Disappointed, should have purchased another Otterbox.  Sleek design is great though.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I use it on my Kindle and it was an improvement over what I originally had.  Since it's a &#34;freebie&#34;, it doesn't have many features even compared to my PC version, but I do like it better than what I had before.  As I use I'll get more used to it.<br />Otherwise it works great; there are NO problems with it.
B003GK212G|2.0|do not buy, unless you have only 30 seconds before boarding a non-wifi flight.  get something else:  christian science monitor, the love life of hyenas, 50 ways to polish a pebble or tricks of underwater basketweaving.<br /><br />the plotline is almost ok (it would pass as an outline), but the characters sound as real as a 3 dollar bill, their motivations are so artificial, it hurts.  things happen outa the blue, just to fill out the milestones.  the book feels like it was written by a bot.  i could go on and on, but i dont think that it is worth belaboring the point.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I've waited for a good Grisham book for quite awhile now, and this is it! It wasn't the least bit confusing with numerous names, and the plot kept you guessing. For this to have been written, took a lot of thought. I've read all his books, and most of the early ones were the best. Through the years, they have declined some, but this ones brings in on!!
B00966TN1Q|3.0|not the exactly vintage harry bosch.  connelly plows thru the plot like he was on a deadline to deliver the manuscript (which he probably was).  the story is quite flat - i was very psyched and got the book hours after it was released on kindle.  by the end of the day, i had ended the book.  it was ok, not the worst, but not a Top10.<br /><br />mr connelly, give us young hieronymus in nam.  actually, you could have a story at bragg, one in nam and 1 coming back and joining the force.<br /><br />and, btw (spoiler here), mr connelly, when you write a story where rookie harry walks in on his 1st DB on his second on patrol, dont write another book where his first days are walking the beat.  us fans, we remember the details and inconsistencies stick out.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I can play this anywhere I can carry my Fire. It's a fun way to pass the time when it's too distracting to read.
B0055SWM08|5.0|William one ok f those apps that is truly worth the B-) purchase. A great way to unwind, yet Be stimulated at once!
B0053O89IS|5.0|bought it for my neice she also has all the rest hasent received this one as its a christmas present<br />  thanks bev nichols
0316228532|1.0|Really excited about her first new adult novel.  Began reading it, kept thinking it would get better, kept thinking it would get better....  Only one redeeming character in the entire book.  Have never read a book with so many characters that I truely didn't care if they lived or died.  Petty little people with little to intrigue the reader.<br />Sigh......................
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The Racketeer  -  It's a real page turner, a real thriller, I liked the ,main character, Grisham did a great job, as usual
0151003084|5.0|This is probably the strangest little book i have ever read. So simple, yet naughty. I found myself giggling every time I read it. I even read it out loud when I'm alone. A must see for anyone with an odd sense of humor. I have read Mr. Gorey was NOT a fan of children and it certainly comes out here. I highly recommend it!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't wait for season 3 to start!<br />I love Downton Abbey. They chose the perfect characters to play the parts, and the setting is just breathtaking.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I've read every book he has written, loved them all. Can't wait for the next Mitch Rapp novel,hope he gets some love life back. The plot had many twists and turns with some surprises. A darn good read.
B0026IQYEU|5.0|This is a must watch! A classic in it's own right and I definitely recommend this film to all.<br />The quality of the Download was also just right for the price.
B005D643PO|4.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE Dexter!  But let's face it, they were kind of mailing this season in.  Must have been tough with Michael sick and all!  I still liked the storyline but just too many inconsistencies to ignore.  Season six gets back to DEXTER
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I liked it because they made the red bird finally do something & I really liked the little scenes they did.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Most are familiar with Angry Birds and their quest to vanquish evil piggies. This version dresses the familiar birds up in costumes that resemble Star Wars characters and scenery. That alone would be worth the price of the ad-free app, just to have new levels of Angry Birds, and the overall coolness of Star Wars. But there's more! This game introduces new physics to the familiar game by including levels that require you to send your birds in orbit around planets, or deal with the effects relative gravity. Extra fun for the same low price :)
B004T32SOK|5.0|This is the ideal package for anyone with multiple computers, smart cell phones, or e readers.  You can back up everything and then access it through all devices.  Very nice.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I really liked this game for a while. And then repetition set in and I found myself drawing the same words over and over. This game could be great if the creators would inject new words into the word lists on a fairly regular basis
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love British shows that are clean.  This is a very good show with a big cast, yet each character basically has its own story line which comes together to make the show.  Well done.

0470638842|5.0|Erik Qualman's Socialnomics may have started as part of the curriculum in a social media course I took, but it evolved into a tool I have referenced over and over again. It is a book that not only clues you in on how social media is changing the business world and how brands develop, but how important it is to keep up your own personal brand. Check out why Socialnomics is a best selling book in 8 different languages, you won't be sorry!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This was really fun for a little while. This is a great way to pass a little time in a waiting room or commute, but be forewarned... the game play never changes. You don't advance to new levels or see any change in the game as you play it, except you earn more and more coins the longer you play the game. You also collect different objects sort of like little prizes, and these get added to little collections until you complete the entire collection. And then literally nothing happens. You &#34;advance&#34; in the game by earning the rewards of having your coins regenerate more quickly when you run out, or having more coins fall in a particular manner. This gets to be a pain, because you wind up regenerating coins so fast you never run out... so that one objective of the game simply falls away as the coins actually become hard to get rid of.

B005LAJ16I|5.0|You will really enjoy this- everyone does!!!  I started watching the series on a Saturday night and watched episode after episode into the the early hours of the morning.  You'll be sitting at the edge of your seat as the story of Brody unfolds.  I don't want to give any of the story away, but in 24 like fashion, you will be trying to figure out where people stand and how the US can be spared from death and destruction.  There's the main story line and then there are the interactions between various characters who truly come to life.  Be aware, if you are considering this purchase for a younger audience, there is nudity, sex, and profanity- it's not gratuitous, but it is there.  Homeland is a thriller that may have you sweating and the next day you'll have plenty to discuss with all your friends because everyone wants to talk about Brody and Carrie- played by Damien Lewis and Claire Danes, two phenomenal actors.  All of the acting in the show is amazing and one of may favorite characters, Saul Berensen, played by Mandy Patinkin is so well written that you actually feel you need this sweet father figure in your life.  Enjoy the series, it will keep you exhilarated and awake until you catch up!
B005LAII80|5.0|I loved this movie. Went in not expecting much and was blown away by how much I enjoyed it. Karl Urban was great as Dredd and Olivia Thirlby was equally great in her role as the rookie. I never pre order movies and rarely pay full price for a blue ray (usually wait for a big price drop) but I really would like to see them make another Dredd, and the box off numbers didn't help the chances much... So I'm preordering this one and hoping a lot of other fans do the same so we can see more!

0393343405|5.0|I found this cultural history a bit reminiscent of the great Arnold Hauser's multi-volume A Social History of Art, although the timeline is shorter. Hauser was from an earlier generation of humanist writers, so I wasn't familiar with Greenblatt, as my education goes back to them and I learned my cultural history from reading authors like Hauser, Daniel Bell, Jacques Barzun, etc., but as a member of the younger generation of cultural historians I think he deserves a place among the above greats  although I don't always agree with his slant on things.<br /><br />The story is a familiar one but Greenblatt presents it in lively and enjoyable prose. It focuses on several individuals whose work was important in the Neoclassical revolution where early Renaissance scholars rediscovered and were inspired by the ancient learning of the Greeks and Romans. These included names such as Poggio Bracciolini, Salutati, and Valla. Among the ancients whose influence was most profoundly felt was Lucretius, whose practical, common-sensical, and non-mystical philosophy has a distinctly modern ring. As it has been many years I'd forgotten many of the details and it was a pleasure to reacquaint myself with the subject again as it's a fascinating story. Not just poetry but also painting, sculpture, architecture, and music were influenced by this newly found learning, of which Greenblatt does a fine job discussing mainly the literature and poetry.<br /><br />However, to really understand how the modern world came to be, you have to know the history of the science too, which was of course also undergoing rapid change during the 13th and 14th centuries leading up to the Renaissance. There are a number of excellent histories on this but among my favorites are Herbert Butterfield's The Rise of Modern Science 1400-1800, and The Mechanization of the World Picture, by E.J. Dijksterhuis which is especially strong on the late Medieval period and early Renaissance. Butterfield is very readable but Dijksterhuis can be somewhat dry and technical, and again I don't always agree with his slant on things but the overall scholarship and depth are worth it. I would recommend you read one or two of the science histories also to get the full picture.<br /><br />Overall a fine presentation on the subject especially for the non-specialist who's looking for a more readable and accessible introduction to the subject.ksterhuis can be somewhat dry and technical, and again I don't always agree with his slant on things but the overall scholarship and depth are worth it.

0747599874|4.0|There is sticker glue on the cover from a sales tag that I can't remove without damaging the cover, other than that, it's in fine shape.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|This is just a terrific adaptation of the 1986 graphic novel by Frank Miller. It may have taken 26 years for it to appear, but it was worth the wait. The animation, voice acting (Peter Weller is outstanding and so are the other voices), and faithfulness to the original concept are superb. Add to that a fine musical score and you have one of the best animated flicks of recent years. I think MIller would have been proud to see this adaptation of his work. I note this is Part 1 so I will eagerly await the sequel.

141659521X|5.0|Diogenes would be proud of Mitch Rapp.<br />Looking for an honest man?  Go no further than the irascible and uber intimidating Mitch Rapp.  A man of brass cojones, Mitch Rapp thrives in a world where death is a constant companion, and political correct waffling a clandestine operator's worse nightmare.  The Last Man is Vince Flynn's best novel to date and tests CIA operative Mitch Rapp to the max.<br />Things are happening in Afghanistan to the clandestine CIA mission, very bad things, and Rapp gets the emergency call to find out why.  Key very important CIA leaders are missing along with extremely vital and important CIA espionage secrets.  To make matters infinitely worse, a new politically correct American-Afghan strategy has recently been enacted to speedup  America's scheduled withdrawal from that war torn country.  Enter the CIA's #1 troubleshooter Mitch Rapp, and things immediately go from bad to worse as violence escalates and Rapp finds himself fighting on all fronts as the story plunges into a whirlwind of mayhem and violence on a grand scale.  To say more would give away too much of this terrific Vince Flynn story and spoil the reading fun.  Suffice it to say, this is one whale of a fast pace, mega thriller tale of covert action, diplomatic intrigue, and vile treason most foul.<br />No gratuitous violence, sex or language.  This is NOT a \\"shoot-`em-up-bang-bang\\" good guys against the bad Islamo terrorists, but rather a well crafted story on the inherent difficulties facing American operatives in a war torn country where political naiveté many times sadly trumps operational reality.<br />Character development was absolutely superb.  Included all the usual suspects and introduced some new members who hopefully will be seen in future Vince Flynn novels.  As Afghanistan winds down, it will be very interesting to see where Mr. Flynn takes Mitch next?  Do I hear Asia calling??<br />Hearty must read recommend.  Mitch Rapp brings out the Walter Mitty in most ofus as we vicariously battle the \\"bad\\" guys through Mitch:  At times it is almost a cathartic reading experience.  And who is the Last Man?  Mitch Rapp knows and you will too.  Well done Vince Flynn, well done.
0321885112|5.0|In coining the term \\"sketchnotes,\\" Mike Rohde simultaneously legitimized professional doodling and accessiblized the craft to anyone who has ever needed to take notes. This book explains sketchnoting in depth, introducing the basics, showcasing great sketchnoters, and providing practical advice on how to start or improve. All students, teachers, business people, and everyone who has to endure boring meetings or lectures should be required to read this book. It is a fantastic reference for the experienced pro as well as the budding novice. I could not recommend it higher.

B007SGM084|1.0|I heard so many reviews about this that I just had to read it.  The published reviews all raved about how fantastic it was, but everyone I know personally that read it raved about how unreadable it was.  So I eventually gave in and read it.  Not a bad basic story ... almost a rags to riches/pretty woman story, but with so much less style and way to much sex.  But then again, I suppose the people that like it are looking for the porn aspect of the book.
B00005K3NR|5.0|This is one of the few films that I have seen that is both a tragedy and horror rolled into one.  I have seen another version where the ending has been changed and the film doesn't end up as a tragedy and it simply doesn't work.<br />Carrie White is a girl that has telekinesis and mild pyrokinesis.  Carrie can't admit to herself that she has these powers, let alone control them.  Carrie has a religious freak mother, who is also insane, that locks Carrie up in a room every time Carrie's telekinesis acts up.  Sue Snell, one of the popular girls, is mean to Carrie and leads the other girls into throwing tampons at Carrie when she gets her first period.  As a result the gym teacher ensures that Sue is banned from prom.  Sue comes up with an elaborate plan to get even with Carrie.  Sue has the kids be nice to Carrie and has one the cutest boys in school start dating Carrie.  For the first time in her life Carrie is happy.<br />Carrie unintentionally kills her mother after her mother tries to kill Carrie because she believes that Carrie is some sort of demon or something like that.<br />Carrie ends up going to prom.  Carrie is even crowned prom queen.  It is the happiest moment of her life.  Just after that Sue and a few other kids dump a bucket of pig's blood on Carrie's head.  Carrie is pushed beyond any limits that she ever had.  Carrie uses her powers to kill everyone there, including herself.  Sue is the only one to survive the horrific incident.  Sue ends up with a guilty conscience and some nightmares.<br />The acting is good.  This is, in my opinion, Sissy Spacek's first film where she became noticed in the film industry.  It is also one of her best.  Amy Irving is fairly good, but she doesn't have the acting ability that Sissy does.<br />The plot is amazing!  It is interesting, captivating, and I got so wrapped up in the film that I failed to think about the end.  That is the way any film should be.  The special effects are great for the time in which it was madeand what was available.<br />This film is a tragedy because despite all the destruction that she causes Carrie is the victim.  It is a horror film because of all the people that are killed and the manner in which they are killed.  Few films are are able to encompass 2 themes that seem to be so different and have a character that engenders so much fear and at the same time empathy in viewers.  Carrie White is truly a pathetic character with a horrific power.  I recommend this film to anyone that likes horror or tragedy films.  This is one of the better films made in the 1970's!
B0043RSK3K|5.0|Read this and weep for the betrayal of the American Dream and its negative projections onto the rest of the world.<br />The mea culpa musings of General Smedley Butler (read his little book: ''War is a Racket' and who stopped a coup d'etat by business interests in 1936) are particularly apposite supported earlier by the observations of General Ulysses Grant, referring to the US invasion of Mexico, in 1848, which, he argued,precipitated the War between the States.<br />Jefferson and founding fathers must be turning in their graves although they share culpability  for the slaughter of the indigenous peoples and the naked theft of their lands: Read American Holocaust as companion volume which covers the period prior to that covered by Untold History and details the coercion, enslavement and genocide of the Native American peoples which prepared the way for the actions covered in Untold History.<br />US now an oligarchy of military industrial complex - Eisenhower warned of this in his end of presidency speech in 1961-and includes Wall Street, the  giant corporates, Pentagon and massive government agencies: CIA, NSA etc etc..<br />It seems Obama has capitulated to these interests.<br />These groups are now so well entrenched that elected government is powerless against them and again raises the specter of Dallas.<br />Stone and his co-author are voices crying in the proverbial wilderness.<br />Horror!

1401207529|3.0|I am a big fan of Frank Miller and his style of writting, this book is no exception. A very noir-stylished story telling yet another origin of the caped crusader. It's a grweat book, entertaining, but not as half as good as they praise it to be. Yes Miller is a great author and the best at what he does but this is not the \\"watchmen\\" it is compared to. Great art, great concept, not enough grittyness and dark themes that Miller has accustomed me to so.
0062127241|5.0|It's all in here, from Pete's birth, through the entire Who career, and beyond. Each Who album and project is detailed and painfully, at times, honest. As a sidebar, I did glean that Keith Moon was a bigger jerk than I had thought possible--and that is saying something. I'm amazed the other three didn't sack him and find a responsible drummer (by '60s rock standards!) back in the beginning years of the band. A great read by one of rock's premier lyricists and musicians.

B009AJDDQU|2.0|For some reason Hollywood is intent on ruining good movie series with mocking religion. They failed with the Matrix and with Tron in this way. They have a movie following for these series just waiting to watch them, then they have to go out and ridicule 85% of the population that identifies themselves as Christians. Piece of advise, keep the story line and do not insert any religion. It would be one thing if it was just some opinions of some of the cast, but the whole story was based upon &#34;the creators&#34;(of which they are label &#34;the engineers&#34;).<br /><br />It is obvious that there was a lot of money spent on this movie. The acting is good and so is the computer animation. To me the main failure of this movie is that they try to do too much with one movie. If they would have broken up this movie into 3 parts, they could have explained much of what seemed to be rushed. Anyhow, watch it. They spent a bunch of money on it, and Charlize Theron is in it.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|This show just keeps getting better. Cant wait to see what happens season 4. Great for viewing on kindle HD.
B009329ZF2|3.0|I gave it three starts because romance is a little too corny, the story line is linear, some of the scenes are a little over the top (6 guys caring a 1000lb ordnance? Six Olympic power lifters couldn't carry that) and the whole movie is way to predictable. With that said, the action and computer animation in the movie was really good. I have watched it a couple of times. It has that 2012 way about it where you know it is cheese, but you through it in on a Thursday night when you are looking for a movie to watch.

B003F5NSTW|5.0|It's not often that I give a review five stars, but this book absolutely deserves it.<br /><br />We Need To Talk About Kevin is written in the veiw point of Eva Khatchadourian, Kevin's mother, via a series of letters to her absent husband. The letters are frank, heartwrenching, thought provoking, and at times, taboo -- as Eva in no uncertain terms declares her hatred of her son, Kevin. But, do not be alarmed, you will not end up hating Eva.<br /><br />Essentially, We Need To Talk About Kevin is a book about nature versus nurture -- are you born evil, or is it the way you are raised that turns a person evil -- and this is what Eva struggles with. Did her dislike of her son drive him to committing such a horrendous crime or was he pre-programmed to do such a thing?<br /><br />I started this book thinking that a child isn't born evil, and now I am not so sure. I don't think it is all down to nature, but I do think nature may play a part in it.<br /><br />What I also loved about this book was here was a woman admitting that she didn't have those maternal feelings, that urge to have a baby, and be a mum. Society drums into us that women must have that maternal urge to reproduce because if you don't then there must be something wrong with you. Not once did I ever think there was something wrong with Eva for not wanting a child.<br /><br />We Need To Talk About Kevin is one of those books that you cannot put down. I read it in two days. It will pull at your heartstrings. It will have you questioning your beliefs. It will have you in tears. Most of all, it'll have you thinking about it long after you have read the last word...

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and once I started I could not put it down.  I thought I was going to struggle with the idea of time travel but it is done so well that I completely bought in. I also found the idea of changing history to be one that kept me thinking well beyond the confines of this book and started many conversations about the 'ripple' effect. I was kept guessing which I always like in a good book!
B0013ND30M|5.0|What can you say about an all-time Disney classic film like Sleeping Beauty? It is very clear and has a lot of extras...which we really don't utilize. My 5 year old granddaughter just loves it!
B004I744AS|4.0|very good app. in offline mode it almost always has the word i'm looking for. there have only been a handful of times it has failed me. all in all this is a great dictionary app. i would recommend this app to others.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|This has quickly become one of my 5 year old granddaughter's favorite movies. It has a good story line and is very easy for kids to understand. I have to say that I enjoy it too!
B009YU9J0E|5.0|Iv always liked Crystal castles, never broke down to buy any of their CD's though. But after hearing this new album, it felt so refreshing and groovy. the beats to Kerosene, transgender, and telepath puts me in a Dance and rythem mood taht can make my personal stresses away for the time being. these guys really know how to hit the psychodelic Nerve with power of talent and sense of direction. I recomend this to anyone who enjoys good techno and looking for something diffrent.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I am fairly new on twitter but I do love it. Small posts of thoughts,  insights, blurbs, funny-ness, etc. Love It!!
B0054VVRBQ|5.0|I received the product on time (2-day shipping). Popped it into my 2006 MacBook Pro, downloaded & installed the driver from the Transcend website, rebooted, and tried it...seems to be okay. Haven't tried it with every kind of SD card that it claims to work with, but I'm confident it will. Using this instead of a separate card reader dangling from a usb cable is much better and will provide much faster data transfers.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I can only view some of the postings - such as most recent 15-20 postings - where before on my previous kindle I could see all postings as far back as I wanted to see.  I don't know if I downloaded a wrong app for FB or if FB changed.  I can see more on my iphone than on the kindle
B005F9TQ2Y|5.0|BEAUTIFUL CD.  JOKERMAN MAKES THIS CD. I ALSO LOVE MAN OF PEACE.  THE WHOLE THING IS GREAT.  I PLAYED THIS OVER AND OVER.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B006K1IIHA|5.0|Wonderful series. Suspenseful and well made, direction, acting, everything.<br /><br />Blu-ray is region free BUT, only plays on certain players because of BBC formatting. From my experience, WILL PLAY ON SAMSUNG, WILL NOT PLAY ON SONY. I don't know about additional brands.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B008N1V11U|5.0|BOUGHT FOR MY 7  YEAR OLD GRANDSON.  HE LOVES IT, GRAPHICS ARE GREAT.  IT KEEPS HIM BUSY AND INVOLVED.  GREAT GAME GREAT PRICE.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|King has always been an inspiration. His descriptive writing in this book is something I hope to be able to do as an up-and-coming author. King's metaphors for how the past protects itself, and his concept of time travel in this book is amazing. Any King fan, or someone who never read one of his books, will really enjoy this one.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Gonna take a while to get through it all [its a pretty massive book], but I like it so far.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I would recommend this series to everyone.  Old, young, and everyone in-between.  It is entertaining and witty and it really shows why Kristen Bell is a star.  The characters are clever and the mysteries do not obvious have obvious answers.  I cried and laugh and watched it all over again.  I'm so sad they never wrapped it up properly, through Kristen Bell still says she would be down to do a movie (it'll never happen).  LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SHOW.
B005C9YZIW|5.0|My boyfriend wanted me to order these for him and he loves them!! great condition and very quick to get here!!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show has given me several unpleasant dreams but I keep coming back for more.  I didn't think they could top the first season but the second season is a very different animal than the first.  I do look away at the neck/wrist slitting because that's not for me, but other than that, I love it!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|It keeps getting better and better all the time, each season has great reviews and enjoy each and everyone of them, I just brought season three and I'm sure there will most certainly be a season four or a five because there is no ending to movies like these.<br /><br />Great action and suspence.
B000SXLL8O|5.0|This CD reminds me of middle school, which ages me a bit.  I love Coldplay and their (at the time) very unique sound.  I enjoy the entire CD and prefer it to some of their newer stuff
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|love this series... got this for my father who is a vet of the korean war... i cant wait for him to open it on xmas
B0055SWM08|5.0|Nice atmosphere and clever puzzles.  Very cool game, and well suited to the tablet venue. I thought it was very good.
B00913DPW2|1.0|didn't like it at all feel it was a watse of money ..played it some was so bored just never went back to it gonna delete it
B000E5N6LG|5.0|Dennis Quaid is fabulous in this flick. Costner is passable. Most historically accurate and authentic of &#34;Earp&#34; genre of films.
B00003CXXS|4.0|Overall the Jurassic Park series is one of my most favorite movie franchises and is something I grew up with as a child. While this certainly isn't the best of the 3, I still love all the new dinosaurs and the new adventure this movie presents!
B00197YZ7M|4.0|Meryl Streep's perfomance wonderful. Eastwood does journeyman's work. It is the best of the late century \\"Love Stories\\" which I don't intend as a condmnation by faint praise. If you like Steep and Eastwood (I do) this is a film for you, though the message is a garbled and the moral of the story is weak.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|I'm surprised that there wasn't a bigger fuss about this movie when it came out; it is really a great family show and right up there with some of the better Pixar shows. I really enjoyed it :)
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Have to pay attention, constantly switches back and forth from this story to that one.  Wanted to hear more about the experience.
B008B0QH5S|5.0|It's been much too long since Chris and Neil did a studio album, and this one is GOOD!<br />They have not lost their touch for electro-pop at its very best.<br />The packaging is abominable; a bulky, oversized cardboard box, but you can get a 2-CD \\"jewel case\\" at many stores and repackage this set easily.<br />That said, this is an excellent album, with the unusual bonus of a second CD of all the same songs... instrumental versions!<br />I easily give this five stars in spite of the stupid packaging.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is the second time I've read the series, and it is just as good as it was the first time! This is the epitome of a love story.. going through so many trials of faith and still knowing there is no one else you'd rather be with. Love it!
B008SVFX96|4.0|Sorry this isn't Richie's best work, I am disappointed with this album, really thought it would stand up to his previous work
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|I am not all they way through it yet but I don't need to be. I bought it because I started watching the 2012 series, not knowing that it started in 2011 until a friend told me. I bought the 2011 and watched number one, so far. I am taping the rest of 2012 and,. heck you know what I mean.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|A man stuck on Mars with his wits as his primary survival tool.  Strangely compelling read.  One would think a story about an engineer using math and inspriration to survive more than a year on Mars would cure insomnia but this turned out to be a rare find (especially for 0.99).  The humor and sheer grit of the main character carry this story.  Can't wait until the next one by this author.  Keep them coming.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have been using this app for a year on my kindle and I love it. You can set and save several different alarms, all with different settings.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved it!!!! Didn't see the end coming... but I was awesome! Can't wait for the next one to be out!
B001CW7ZXK|5.0|I especially enjoyed the biography disc because my yearbook photo is in it. Chris Miller, the co-author of Animal House, was my fraternity brother.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Romance, comedy, drama..great movie! It doesn't feel scripted and has realistic outcomes. It really speaks to the silent and hidden changes that occur over time in a relationship that is sometimes irreversible without intervention from a third party.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Good story but seemed to lack the page-turning drive of his previous books.  Hopefully his next one will get closer to what we've come to expect.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I liked it but it was not as good as the ones in the past. I was somewhat disappointed with it.
030758836X|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book; however, I did not like the ending.  The things that happen in a marriage!<br />Very interesting plot.
B009G7ZYUO|5.0|Simply an amazing box set collection, 2 DVDs with concerts and music videos, a demo tape (which is quite frankly awesome!), a cool poster, a 40 page booklet, and the first RATM album released to be the public. For the price, you simply can't beat it, if you are a RATM fan.
B006VABV6U|5.0|After reading a couple of Baldacci's books we decided to read them all.  Have not been disappointed. . . .
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Excellent music!!!! Love it...waited so long for the release - too long!! And it was worth waiting for the music
B003EYVXTG|4.0|Filming, casting, writing-all great on this movie! Though a difficult subject, I am so impressed with the strength of the main character even through all she is exposed to in life. Worth the time and money to own.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I'm so happy I discovered amazon instant video! Now I can rent movies and watch t on my ipad or tv TED was hilarious !
B003INBNXO|4.0|If your a martial arts fan you will love this and IP Man 2. Inspiring story on how charter and decisions affect more than just you or the present. This really should be thought of as part one of two. Can be seen alone, but you will want to see the second movie to fill in the story more completely.
034580404X|3.0|I am almost 2/3 of the way done with the 2nd book.  So far this is my favorite.  I almost quit reading during the first book.  The graphic nature almost got in the way of the story.
B001A4LYN2|2.0|Very good filming and story for the most part. The ending was so difficult to watch that the whole movie was tainted for me. I will say my son really liked it all so perhaps this should be a 2.5 star? The main character just ended up being to bad for me to ever expose myself to him again.
B004XJ4IIY|4.0|The themes of beauty, wasted wealth, and meaningless lives course through this typical Fitzgerald river. But hey, who am I to critique his style? \\"The Beautiful and the Damned\\" continues in the eloquent language of unique metaphor and flowing imagery for which Fitzgerald is known. If you like his other works, you'll most likely enjoy this one.
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|Very bad, a pathetic movie at best.  If you haven't seen it don't let your curiosity overpower your common sense.
B001H1SVO8|3.0|If you're in the mood for senseless violence, colorful characters, and a twisted end, I suppose it all adds up. As always, both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt pulled great performances, but I question why they chose to do the film as its lasting value is very slight.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|Love these movies. Fun memories of youth! Wax on, wax off. Memorable words.<br />Wish it did not force me to type so much when I have nothing left to say.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Loudness. Power. Mussels. Clams. More loudness. Over the top and a good time. Jean Claude has a lot of power as an actor...he's really intense. The budget was big for this film and it was all on the screen. A fun ride.<br />My only question is...how do you get a part of a henchman in these movies? How many stunt guys doing flips amid the chaos and fire are there on the film registry? When did they graduate from the street to make it into these blast furnaces of action? Well, I can't really volunteer even...once you're on blood thinners...the roles just slip outta your hands. Hey, if you just want me to fall over on a mattress...no..I'd still bruise. Hey, if you want to rent bruises.....<br />Not quite sure what's going on with Arnold's hair.<br />Can't even imagine coordinating all the action and stunts in a movie like this.<br />And these barren locations with massively depressing buildings and light...always available for detonation....<br />Hollywood is a big bad machine. Maybe that would be a good location for the next action film.<br />Gotta go. Hobbit 48 frame per second 3-D ride approaching fast. Gotta bring a barf bag, I hear.
B0053O89JM|5.0|So sad to see the series to come to an end. It is hard to believe that they ran 8-seasons. I was going to say this season was very odd, but then again aren't all seasons of House odd. You have your usual pure comedy episodes, more series and some that are little depressing, but then that is what makes House so great. Cuddy is out the picture now and Foreman is in charge of the hospital. We see the return some of our old favorites and introduce a couple new people to the team. Without giving much away, I will say the last few episodes are incredible and debunks the assumption that House is selfish and only cares about himself as you will see with the extreme sacrifices he will make to be able spend time with and help Wilson. Yet, he is still up to his usual antics this time at the expense of Foreman. I have the past 7 seasons on DVD and am glad to be able to have the complete series. If you already have the other seven, you must get this one.
0446401307|5.0|I had read a couple of these over the years, but was able to get the whole collection and am going all the wry through.  It is great!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Saw this in the theatres and really didn't know much abut the movie at the time. I had only seen the first of the Iron Man movies prior. I would recommend watching both Iron Man movies and Thor (will be very beneficial to understanding the main plot of The Avengers) and possibly Captain America (still have to watch that one) before watching this movie. It is well over two-hours, but it so action packed you won't even realize the time until it is over.
0446613444|5.0|I had read a couple of these over the years, but was able to get the whole collection and am going all the wry through.  It is great!
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Awesome movie, explains so much. Set mostly in 1969, J goes back in time to save K (and their relationship). J is in for a bit of shock when he returns to 1969. You really don't have to see the other two movies to understand what is going on here. It could almost be considered a prequel to the series.
044661758X|5.0|I had read a couple of these over the years, but was able to get the whole collection and am going all the wry through.  It is great!
B004IQMXD4|5.0|I have loved Stevie Nicks music for many years now and was pleasantly surprised to see a new album from her. The album was good, but I don't think it was as good as her older works. I think in time this album will grown on me, but nonetheless I would recommend it for anyone who likes Stevie Nicks.
0446619078|5.0|I had read a couple of these over the years, but was able to get the whole collection and am going all the wry through.  It is great!
B000N3ST7A|3.0|I am not sure why I say it is odd, it just is. Doesn't seem like your typical Great Hits album, may be cause it isn't really. It a 'Best of' which is sorta like a Greatest Hits, but includes some live performances. The only reason I bought it was it came up as a bundle deal with Bella Donna and her newest album. Unless you are die hard Stevie Nicks fan, pass on this album. Many of the tracks are from Bela Donna and the live stuff just wasn't that great.
0395389496|5.0|My grandson loves the movie and wants to watch it over and over.  I am sure he will also love the book.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I cannot remember if I purchased this on sale but I probably did as it sat in my Amazon.com video locker for 21 days before I decided to watch it. I was very suprized and pleased by both the story and the acting. I am a big scifi fan and did not know what to expect, the story line is great a blood sport contest going on for decades for the sake of tradition. The \\"Happy hunger days\\" line was an odd twist but fit with the plot. My suggestion is to give this flic a try, \\"and may the odds be ever in your favor\\" :)
0316152196|5.0|I had read a couple of these over the years, but was able to get the whole collection and am going all the wry through.  It is great!
1439152802|4.0|This melodrama set mostly in London during World War II revolves around a secret. 90-year-old Dorothy is dying and her eldest daughter, a famous actress named Lauren, becomes obsessed with discovering a mystery. When she was only 16, Lauren had seen her mother stab a stranger to death. She covered for Dorothy by pretending to have witnessed the man assaulting her mother. What was behind this astonishing act of violence that has haunted not only Dorothy and Lauren but her little brother Gerry, the only other witness although he was only two at the time.<br /><br />The plot alternates between 1940 and 2011 and we the readers learn little by little about Dorothy's love for the photographer, Jimmy; about her friendship with the rich and glamorous Vivien and a cast of lesser characters, some of whom are more vividly drawn than others. The book gets off to a painfully slow start and the author certainly doesn't believe in using 10 words where 20 will suffice. But all is redeemed in the surprise ending which I for one did not see coming. And one is left with the realization that the effort required to plow through this book is after all worthwhile.
B0052GACNM|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this CD.  Musical virtuosity is unbelievable.  Tony's selections of partners for this CD is outstanding.  What a great contribution.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I bought this as a gift and it came exactly as stated. It was delivered on time. I gave it a 5-star rating because it deserves it!.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book! I couldnt put it down! Cant wait to read the whole series!! Action packed that will have keep u on ur toes!
B00479SVBU|1.0|Found this item and was excited as it promised to do everything I needed. What I received was a very expensive 12 volt night light. The display lit up but the unit does not work. How about some QUALITY CONTROL with Sansa products. I don't know what I will try next, but it won't be anything from Sansa. Maybe I'll get one of those 40 pound boom boxes from the 80's and put it the back seat. If anyone knows of a product with similar features, hip me to it!
B008DM4OTA|5.0|Gave this game 5 stars because there weren't more! This is a great game for my 4 yr old grandson ..he thinks it is funny and enjoys &#34;curing&#34;  the sick patients! Lol. His big sis loves it too..ha. and so do I!!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|there are many pictures to choose from and it is a lot of fun to mess with them every time that i am on this app i enjoy myself best app ever!!
B00003CX9E|5.0|just about the greatest movie of all time, the things that all film students should be required to see, there was so much work that went into this movie. It is an instant, and original classic.
B005LAII1C|1.0|I sat thru this entire film and never laughed once. I'm a big fan of \\"The Family Guy\\" so I really expected more from this film. It was so bad I had to go to the menu to make certain I wasn't watching the deleted scenes by mistake.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|After watching, and being a huge fan of, The Piano Guys on YouTube and Facebook, I was so excited to get their first CD.<br /><br />It is an amazing CD! I love every song on it. My kids (ages 14, 12, and 10) refuse to go to sleep at night unless this CD is on repeat. They ask for it all day long, and watch every new video that comes out. We can't wait for the next album from these five talented guys.
B0073XORCY|5.0|After all this time, to do Part 2 of one of the great albums, he certainly excelled. Little Gerald would have been proud.. I bought the 5.1 & its terrific, & carry the stereo version in the car. I am hoping Santa now brings TAAB1 in 5.1 next week.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kept me in enough suspense to finish it in three days.  I enjoyed the writing and was kept on the hook throughout the entire book.  It was not complex by any means, it did not challenge me on a philosophical level. Just a fun read for me!
B004E2XAFW|3.0|Fans of Within Temptation always compare them to Evanescence, Lacuna Coil, and many other female led bands but don't seem to realize that they don't even play the same kind of music as those bigger named international bands. Putting Within Temptation into the \\"goth\\" genre is so laughable. They're more like depressing, pop-rock. Their music isn't even close to the powerhouse rock that Evanescence and Lacuna Coil perform. If you don't like Amy Lee or Cristina Scabbia, don't listen to their bands. But don't trash them because it's a different style of music than what Within Temptation puts out. And, seriously, Sharon Den Adel can't hold a match to Amy or Cristina. Heck, Miley Cyrus has a more powerful voice than Sharon.  Frankly, this band is so weak compared to Evanescence and Lacuna Coil. Every time W/in Temptation puts out something new, I try to listen to it but it's not there. Just because they're not getting the attention the BIGGER named, female led hard rock bands are getting, don't get all emotional.
B002SJIO5E|1.0|I went to see this movie in theatres with my husband and his family and the camera movements were so shakey it made us all sick and we had to leave after the first 10 minutes...What I did see I thought was disgusting...I wouldn't recomend this movie to anyone.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Season two of the American Horror story anthology is shaping up to be a \\"wtf\\" thrill ride. Well, not an edge of your seat roller coaster ride where you pee your pants or barf in your own face, but more like a nervous passenger in the car while your recently immigrated relative drives on 405 with their new license. You might be thinking, well...that doesn't sound pleasant, but to people like me who like this crap, it is very enjoyable. It is nice for once to not know what the hell is going on in advance, what to expect from the characters, to rely on the same song sung by a different singer over and over and over again in television and movies gets old quick. It's usually always the same damn drivel recycled, and thankfully that is not the case with this show.<br /><br />Having a show where boy meets girl is not the center of the plot is nice as well. I can't recall a series where there is more than one \\"bad guy\\" and added to that developed characters you get sympathy for, save for maybe Dexter. Also a new thing is having different \\"bad guy\\" types/categories. For example you'll never see a show with zombies AND Psycho serial killers, especially not with Nazi evil scientists and slutty nuns. I mean call me crazy but even Dexter has drawn it's line of bridges it won't cross. This show doesn't care, it walks in the room and lays it's gigantic balls on the table and say's \\"See this, I'm doing it, because **** You, that's why\\"<br /><br />I liked season one, it was completely different from this one, and that is something I also really like a lot. The anthological nature of the series is pretty cool, because honestly with that much chaos you can't keep it up without the show turning to poo. Also, The opening credits nerps me out, I feel like I am watching old scare tv from the early 90's late 80's, in the dark as a fragile minded preteen. Remember Elvira? Freakshow? Tales from the crypt? We've needed something new that follows those footsteps, the bastard child of the creepshow. Watch a few episodes, you might really like it.pshow. Watch a few episodes, you might really like it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Hey you want to test your skills and enjoy the experience.  Try this game.  My sister love it and turned me on to it.  I somewhat turned my grandson on to it and there are times he says this is to hard for him.  This is truly a mind game and concentration is required.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|You feel like you know the characters so well.  Would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys a well written book.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|This book was helpful. Unfortunately, what made it confusing was the poor formatting...and by formatting I mean book layout. It was not really easy to follow and finding what I needed was a bit cumbersome, a fact I find ironic in a book about formatting books for an ereader. Still, if you stick with it and really comb through the chapters, you will find most everything you need. Think of it as an adventure...
B008NNNF7G|4.0|Reminds me of the old southern rock days.  Prettly Little Lie is my favorite song on the album.  I plan on listening to it quite a bit more and will add another review if it is any better than my initial impression.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I was enthralled with this movie from beginning to end. All of the actors did a spectacular job. I can't wait to buy this movie for my own.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I really like it because I can do anything on my Kindle e-mail with Yahoo Mail that I can do on my laptop.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Her style of writing keeps you interested.i usually read mysteries,and enjoy being shocked.I was<br />Interested in all the characters and still think about them
B0044KJIIC|5.0|Smallville is one of the best takes on the Superman story I have ever seen. The actors are amazing and the story lines are great.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|This is one of those rare movies that everyone loved. My four year old son, my wife, and I love this movie. We've seen it 50 times and I'm looking forward to seeing it again. Great storyline, acting, characters, etc... Enjoy.
0470901071|3.0|I like Todd Lammle, and overall, I like his CCNA book. His approach is very casual, as many have said. It is written as though he is talking to you, and that does hold one's attention better.  If you are brand new to networking, or just have Net+ level knowledge, then this is a great choice to bring your personal knowledge up.    That said, if you are using this book as your sole resource to study for, take, and pass the CCNA, you will be obliterated....even if you are in a Cisco networking profession. The problem is that the information provided in this book, while again, excellent for increasing and familiarizing yourself beyond Net+, is not enough alone to get you through the actual difficulty and content of the test.    I began studying with this book 3 years into my network engineering career (mind you, I do not have a technical academic background, and found this passion post-college). I read this book cover-to-cover, highlighting anything I found remotely important. I then re-read the book a 2nd time immediately, mostly the information I highlighted on my first read, being sure to ask mentors anything I was uncertain about. There are 1-3 assessment tests after every chapter. I took every test in the book until I passed all of them 100%.    Because the CCNA has such a punishing failure rate (88% chance you will fail the first attempt), and costs $300 each attempt, I felt I had better be safe and pick up a few more resources; CCNA Exam Cram by Jeremy Cioara, for example. Right away I noticed the assessment tests were much more challenging than Todd's tests, and was failing most sections (by Cisco's standards, which is anything below 86% correct). I did the same thing with Jeremy's book - Practiced all 330 questions until I understood the \\"why?\\" for each and could consistently pass by Cisco's standards.    But then I was faced with a thought; If Todd's book isn't enough, what if Jeremy's isn't enough also? Due to this, I chose to find and complete more practicetests/crams, and while the increased difficulty slope wasn't quite as high from Jeremy's material to this material as Todd's to Jeremy's was, it was still enough that I was scoring under 86% again (78% on average). Did the same thing here. Took these tests hundreds of times, referencing Todd's book, Jeremy's book and mentor advice on anything I got wrong, and scheduled the test after I could pass 100% of all test material I had accumulated.    I passed in March of 2012 on my first try, after about a year of non-stop study and 4 years on the job experience. My point in all of this; There is no \\"1\\" piece of material that will solely prepare you to pass the CCNA. This exam is a ton of work and requires multiple resources. Expect to spend $100-$300 on resource material (plus the $300 to take the test) if you want to competently pass. It will pay for itself when you land the job you wouldn't have before being certified.    In closing, Todd's book is an excellent preliminary/1st step in beginning the CCNA study/comprehension process. Purchase it, read it twice, take the assessments hundreds of times. Purchase the Cisco Press CCNA book by Wendell Odom...read it once, take the assessments until you can pass them all. Purchase 2-3 practice test resources WITH EXPLANATIONS, and take every one until you can consistently pass all the material you own. Then schedule the test, and you should pass on the first try. I cannot stress enough that you find references with explanations for the questions; It doesn't do you much good if you don't know \\"why\\" an answer is wrong.    Back to my original thought though, if you just want to casually increase your knowledge with no plans to take the test or just have some standard-issue reference material on hand, then this is the best material available.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Gillian Flynn tends to have main characters who are flawed, and Camille Preaker is no exception. I found the plot to be somewhat predictable in the last half of the book, but Camille was fascinating even as some of her behavior disgusted me. I read this book straight through in about 6 hours - I literally could not put it down.
B003G93ZCM|5.0|Many of the stories shared by Mr. Cernan are simply hilarious.<br /><br />There's no doubt that this man is as tough as Evel Knievel, and his writing style reminds me of Mark Twain. Lots of memorable quotes (&#34;Guys from Grumman were literally kissing every LM before shipping it off to NASA&#34;).<br /><br />Truly recommended!
0446580848|5.0|I love this writer and the John Corey character is hilarious.  Lots of twists and turns makes an exciting read
B009DJB9HC|5.0|My first album was Help from the Beatles, I was lucky to be able to grow up when music was fun and put a smile on your face  In High school the battle of the bands, Turn on the radio and hear Free, Cream and Jethro Tull with a little BAD COMPANY thrown in. Today's music has lost something it's music with out a soul..cords and words no feeling..Black Country Communion music has brought back the smiles..the feeling of what we grew up with... it's nice to be able to come home.. if just for a while. Afterglow BCC best album to date, it's something we all need.. something to put a smile on your face...5 Stars
B003HKN52U|1.0|Product as described. Enjoyed the movie, Brad Pitt and  Tom Cruise with Antonio Banderous and a young Kirsten Dunst as Vampires! Too cool!  SWW
B001NEXEEG|5.0|When Donavon tells Valence to pick up the steak I could feel the emotion. Marvin played the part perfectly. The hint of fear on the bully not wanting to lose face. Unsurity. Wayne's glaring eyes without a hint of fear. Challenging. The rest of the movie was good but that scene is one of my all time favorites.
B000UR9T8C|5.0|I really love these old Spiderman movies!  This one is really good.  You know how the first movie in a series is usually really good, and then every one after that just seems to go down hill from there?  Well, that is NOT the case with this movie!  I love it.  Amazon got it to me fast and the packaging was great!  I would recommend it to anyone!
8866130907|5.0|I get it every year - for the last 5 years. I love the size, the feel, and the fact that the calendar part is on one side of the book with lots of space to write on the opposite page!
B007LE2VDM|3.0|Wife wanted this song for some reason, probably because she has no taste in music and likes to waste money.
B0018OFN2W|5.0|This is the best movie ever. Fast cars, more fast cars, and then EVEN MORE FAST CARS! Does not disappoint.
B0000Z0HMQ|5.0|I can't get enough of Ray Harryhausen! Huge fan for forty years. I finally have a copy of this. One of his best movies.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is a author that breaths life into his works. by setting parameters, rules and applying physics he creates worlds that feel so close you could touch them.  my only compliant of the emperors soul is that it had to end.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|I love the Rolling Stones! One of my favorite rock bands. This album ranks as one of my desert island disks.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I chose a 5 star rating because of the twists and turns in this novel.  Grisham did an outstanding job and I loved the ending and the total book.
0060557818|4.0|Neverwhere was a fun urban fantasy read.<br /><br />1)Characters<br /><br />The main character, I'll admit, is a bit dull, especially when you compare him to the side characters. He is not memorable. However, I could forgive it because I felt that being an average guy allowed the reader to better engage themselves in the world Gaiman has created. Toward the end, the protagonist does take action and, at the least, develops into a stronger character by the end of the novel.<br /><br />The side characters and the villains are the backbone of the story for me. The villains had charm, wit, and interactions that had me grinning. The characters, including the very minor, are each vibrant in their own respect. Their interactions were the best parts of the read for me.<br /><br />2)Plot and Setting<br /><br />I love a good urban fantasy. The juxtaposition between our world and the `fantasy' one was a delight to read. There are sharp contrasts between the worlds, though that is not to say the fantasy realm is demanding of pages and pages to explain. Gaiman has a knack for giving just enough details to keep you in awe without bombarding you with unnecessary sensory information.<br /><br />The plot was fun. There wasn't a lot in terms of the protagonist taking charge and propelling it forward. Most of it is out of his hands it seems until we approach the end. Still, I was fascinated by the world and its characters that I barely took notice that I was missing my favorite character-driven plot. It could be said that the side characters take charge and the protagonist tags along.<br /><br />The ending was sweet and satisfying as well.<br /><br />Also, this book has multiple POVs, which usually turns me off because it's difficult to execute. I was pleased that Gaiman did a thorough job keeping them all well paced and making each one add to the novel's charm rather than take away.<br /><br />3)Writing<br /><br />I like Gaiman's writing in general, having read his collection of shortstories prior to reading this. There's no ridiculous amount of prose, none of it is too flowery. His descriptions are less there to just physically detail a character or world and more like tools that help elaborate what kind of character or world we're introduced to.<br /><br />I will say though that the opening didn't sell me right away. It took a few pages to get my interest piqued.<br /><br />-x-Overall-x-<br /><br />A fun urban fantasy that had incredible characters, minus the protagonist. Though I wouldn't read it again soon, I was very glad I did pick it up.<br /><br />Readability: Medium
1419705849|5.0|My daughter enjoyed it immensly, she has liked the whole series, would recomend these books to 3rd graders and forward.<br /><br />Thanks
B001RI3DZI|5.0|This movie has very good feel. It keeps you guessing to the very end. The ending is actually believable as well. Most movies anymore the villain and the good guy hold hands and skip off into the sunset instead of someone getting shot.
B0096DFBZQ|2.0|Unfortunately, this pac-man game is not worth downloading as an application, 'cause it only has one track with the download.  If anything, this download should have included 2 to 4 tracks with it to where someone would be able to get/receive a feel (experience) for this type of game.  Also then with this much information it would be more fun and be worth while making it a grand experience.
B002ZG98UA|5.0|Milla is perfect for this type of movie, I love her! She is feminie, yet a warrior, my idol! Don't much care for all the &#34;matrix&#34; effects, but overall, the movie was great, good plots, never know what is going to happen next, and great stars involved! Highly recommend!<br />Paula
B009YP9L7U|5.0|A fun,fast and great read. The book was hard to put down. Thank you for the lighthearted story once again.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I have read every book Michael Connelly has written on Harry Bosch and this is one of his best. The story keeps moving along and everything relates to the story not a bunch of nonsense.  That guy knows how to write and I can't wait for the next Harry Bosch story to come out.  I'll be the 1st to put my name on the waiting list. Go Michael Connelly Go.!!!
B009H442DG|5.0|Loved the cd, Newton-John is always fantastic, and travolta is so adorable. Great selection of songs. Would defintely recommend it.
B00867GHS8|5.0|thanks so much i been waiting to get this movie on blue ray forever :)  came quick and fast. thanks again
B007REV4YI|5.0|Either give us a choice between UV or iTunes or I won't be buying this. Ridiculous. I love DC's and I have more of an incentive to purchase a Bluray if its combo pack contains an iTunes DC. I skip every single Bluray that doesn't come with an iTunes DC. I have over 100 DC's in my iTunes library.<br /><br />Edit: MGM did include an itunes DC.  They give you the choice of UV or iTunes.  Thanks MGM.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|bought  serenity to finish the firefly series ,very good movie,quite different, recommend to anyone if they like science fiction movies
0743277465|5.0|I was initially directed to &#34;The Art of Learning&#34; by Day9 or Sean Plott who is the Starcraft commentator and is very focused not only on just improving your quality of play in the game of Starcraft but in learning how to improve every time you do play.  I respect Sean's opinion, so I checked out the book a little while ago, read some reviews that were positive, but not as positive as I would have thought considering Sean's recommendation.  I let the book go for a little while, but have since come back to it after my curiosity got the better of me.  And I'm very glad that it did.<br /><br />&#34;The Art of Learning&#34; is a book focusing on much of Josh Waitzkin's life, how he has come to understand what learning means and how he uses this method of learning to excel in several areas of his competitive life.  I believe it's important to understand that when you pick up this book, there is no How To step by step plan to just skim over and you can implement immediately.  There are several areas that Josh brings attention to, which Josh himself only realizes after hours upon hours of doing repeated actions and thinking that he found to work for him.<br /><br />What I thought was interesting about Josh's search for learning and using that learning to achieve excellence is that it was all started by his father's book of &#34;Searching for Bobby Fischer&#34; which focused on Josh's chess career.  The book actually brought about a kind of pressure and celebrity status that Josh did not want nor did it do any favors for his actual chess playing.  The book created distractions and (I believe) caused Josh to almost drop chess altogether.  Out of this new-found pressure to perform at something that he just enjoyed playing and competing at, Josh was forced to re-examine what it meant to enjoy, get better at, and compete with chess or, for that matter, any kind of competitive field.<br /><br />Getting into the heart of the book, when Josh begins this journey of what it means to actually learn and improve at a given field, it becomes apparent that learning is exactly what you thought it was going to turn out to be (or at least to me, it did).  The point about learning and improving is that it takes time, A LOT of time.  There is no easy road, shortcut, cliffnotes version of getting good at something.  Even Josh himself, who has focused so much time on what it means to learn, has spent hours upon hours upon even more hours devoting himself to practice, whether that be in chess or in Tai Chi (Push Hands).<br /><br />For example, Josh writes about his experiences of practicing Tai Chi on numerous nights against the same people practicing one concept or one move.  And that is where the excellence comes into play.  After practicing one move, one idea for so long, the human body is able to perform that action without any conscious thinking, and with that extra space for conscious thinking, you are able to variate moves and ideas that to the average person would seem divinely inspired.  It's actual just a testament to intense practice over a long period of time.<br /><br />To sum up, the book shows an incredible journey into what it means to learn and how the human brain and body can assimilate something to make it its own.  The book's reading is easy enough, there may be some parts you may want to go back to and re-read, but it's nothing too crazy.  I would highly recommend this book though to anyone.  It's a wonderful reminder that to do anything well, it takes a lot of time, and it's especially good to hear in this age of instant gratification.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|i rate this series higher than startrek or star wars,fox sure made a big mistake in not staying with this program,did i say we enjoyed  the series
1401929281|3.0|I first got word of Theta Healing on a plane in one of those sky mall books in the back of the seats at the end of this past summer.  When I arrived back home, I did some more research about the book and Vianna Stibal and decided to take a chance and try the book out.  I wouldn't say that I was in a mid-life crisis (since I'm only 25), but I would say that I have had this feeling of being lost in life with no clear direction that I want to go in.  As a result, I've been open to self-help and other kinds of helping guides in order to find something to get me back on track.<br /><br />Coming with that kind of attitude and starting with Theta Healing, I would say that the book really opened my mind to what is possible and out there than even before.  And I thought I was open-minded, but this book really challenged my skepticism and willing to believe and just try.<br /><br />The book itself has a deluge of information, especially for someone like me who is very new this kind of psychic work, healing, chakras, reiki, etc.  The information is very helpful and covers a broad range of topics, some of which I said in the sentence prior.<br /><br />My criticism (which led to my 3 star rating) is that the book is not very well organized, at times incoherent, and sometimes a chore to read through.  My biggest gripe with the book would be the organization because there are many times while I was reading the book where I felt that techniques to achieve a theta state would be later in the book and the results of what can happen once you are in a theta state would be in earlier chapters.  It's as if Vianna wanted to show you what is possible with this kind of mindset and belief, and then getting into the actual how to with more experiences and instruction scattered throughout.  This leads to a lot of flipping back and forth among the chapters and searching for certain parts that are difficult to find leading to some frustration.<br /><br />All in all, I credit this book for starting down a path to realizing the power of energy, a focused state of mind, meditation, etc.  It's not the clearest book on the subject, but if you're curious, it's not a bad read.  You just need to be patient.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|Very lovely movie for the whole family.  My 6 year old granddaughter watches this movie over, and over and over again.  Tangled is HER fairytale.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I don't know what the other reviewers were talking about. I thought the story was great, Jeremy Renner is an amazing addition to the franchise, and the action was great too. I hope they play this out with some sequels. Can't wait to see the next one.
B006C1DH92|5.0|My grandchildren played with this game over and over on the kindle fire.  I really never payed much attention to what all the swooshing with their fingers was all about until one day when I was bored.  I decided to try the game out.  What FUN!!!  It is an easy game to learn.  You have to slice the fruit with your sword (your finger) before it drops off the screen.  Sounds easy except they throw in bombs, that once sliced, blow up and you lose!!!  Just a fun game, for the 3 year old grandson, 6,7 and 10 year old granddaughters, all the way up to their grandmom.
B0098460O4|5.0|I first saw them online and I knew that I wanted to follow them, but I didn't hear a whole lot more about them. I was waiting and waiting and then this appeared!!! I was so glad that while they had been away, they were making an album. I purchased it the day it came out and was not dissapointed. \\"Forse(unintended)\\" is a beautiful almost haunting song and it really sticks in my head and is one of my favorites. \\"Vero Amore\\" is probobly my very one favorite from this album, it has a strong beggining and Jonathan's vocals are very smooth and Charlotte does a great job on this album. I also enjoyed that the lyrics were included in the packet so you can sing along. Every time we go on a car ride, I ask to listen to this cd!!!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Great Case.  Very easy to install on the kindle fire.  It would also be very easy to take off but there is no need.  Just leave it on.  My grandchildren have dropped my Kindle several times with this case on and it has protected it every single time.  I love it so much that I brought 3 more of them for friends.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the many twists and turns to the story.  You are never really sure which character is the most evil until it all unfolds at the end.  Well Done!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Fun app.  Great  for kids and for oldies like me (71). Controls are easy to use.  Although probably not necessary for most kids to get onto, the app has a very good,brief \\"for parents\\" intro that explains how it works. The salon allows great creativity and changes can be done and redone. No in product purchases.<br />BUT Loads great on 2011 kindle fire, not on new Kinfle fire HD.  Space is not a problem.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Great cast and direction<br />My whole family got caughtbup in this awesome coming og age film<br />Kudos to the whole cast of young actors. Willis, Norton and Murray were great
B007SPRQW0|5.0|Always a fun book that kids want read to them over and over again. Also easy for them to &#34;read&#34;.
B004LROUNG|4.0|I felt this was one of Mr Grisham's slower books. While the humor is great, and writings superb, I felt it travels a bit slowly<br />.
0345525558|4.0|A friend recommended this book and my daughter who is 21 read it and enjoyed it very much and she shared it with a friend who also is liking it. I myself haven't had a chance to read it yet
B005FDXT32|5.0|Great movie, can't get enough of the 80s classic movies. So happy to finally have a copy in Blu-ray for my collection. Great price and love the convenience of Amazon.
1401322786|3.0|This book makes for an interesting book discussion in terms of how time runs our lives but I didn't really enjoy the story itself. I expect better from Mitch Albom
1451648537|5.0|Wow, what a great book.  So much information on Steve Jobs and how he changed the world with his technology and standards.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read all of these books and holy cow did it hold my attention. The husband enjoyed the results of me reading those books. WOW!!!!!!!!
B004QX07G4|5.0|This book was such fun to read I just sat down and read it in one day!  It was as if Ellen was talking to me, I could just hear her voice!  Very funny!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Good story.  Some parts were not neccesary.  Once you start reading you cannot stop. Skip through the sexual scenes if you need to.  I dont think I will buy the second or third books.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|Great cover, good protection, lightly padded, fits well, easy to use. The only thing better would be more storage on the back for accessories. The price is way cheaper than the fancy leather sleeves.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|this book is super funny when he rememers before he was born hahhahahahaha love i :] i love jeff kinney heis diary of a wimpy kid series has kept me etertaint for years i hope he writes more of his amazingly hilarious graohic novels
0439023491|3.0|All three books are easy to read good story telling. The Catching Fire #2 and #3 could have been placed in one volume with hunger games. Each book for me was a day reader and more suitable for young readers that want a good story with a simple plot. The third book Mocking Jay left me disappointed kind of like the author gave up and wanted to get done with a quick finish. Poor ending. Could have done better. My grand-child will enjoy them.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I give it a 4 and a half out of five.it has really good graphics. its tied in with star wars well.
0439023513|3.0|Poor ending, read like a way to quick end a book. Should have put all 3 books into one. Good book for young readers.
B009DJB9HC|5.0|Very happy with this CD, just what I expected!  Definitely recommend it. My husband also loves it too. You will not be sorry.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I hate this stupid game, not because it is stupid but because it is so adictive and challenging. I have not played many game for many years. I am 63 years old and have enjoyed this game so very much. This is a bad thing makes me want to try more games. Kudos to the inventors of angy birds, what a fun game.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|It was uncomfortable to watch this movie and see them struggle with their marriage.  I guess it made dislike the movie and appreciate my own marriage all the more.
0439023521|3.0|Good opening to the story, is agood setup for the rest to follow. I would have like all three books to have been one. The last book mocking jay killed the whole series with what seemed like a shortcut ending. Could have been better.
B009X2CUYA|4.0|Very interesting way to synergize the past into the present and to keep the suspense rolling along while introducing additional mysteries into the unfolding puzzle.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Free is a good thing. This is a simple bare-bones solitair game. This game works well and is entertaining. A good time killer.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I play this game constantly, and the new random boards make replayability a given.  Highly recommended!!!  Got it months ago as faotd, new board updates are fairly common, and now I never run out of boards to play.  I almost like the random boards better than the picture boards.  If you like sudoku, you'll love this!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This whole series was simply amazing.hopefully when you open this book you have noothing else to do, because once you start reading you will probably not move until you are finished
B00415ZW58|5.0|The only problem I had was that it automatically defaults to Cantonese audio.  You have to go in and change it to Mandarin on the setup at the start of each disk.  Besides that it was great!
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|I have read all of Clancy's books. Although this is not as bad as some (Red Rabbit, Cardinal of the Kremlin) that he did after the really good books (Red Storm Rising, Hunt For Red October, Clear and Present Danger) it is still really slow in parts. It spends way to much time on stuff that adds no value to the story. It is as if Clancy gets paid by the word and he is trying to come up with stuff to fill pages. I was hoping for some military action but there is very little of that. Heavy on the spy stuff, relationship and character history that really don't add much to the story. Spoiler Alert...the whole section on the history of Melanie's dad and the story of him being a traitor was not needed. The fact that he was a traitor and that is how she got hooked is fine; all the back story, not.  It was so slow at times that I found myself skimming pages until something interesting happens.
B00A50PE6K|5.0|Not sure why the writers have lost their way with the show.  The plots and characters have become more annoying than lovable. Kurt, once everyones favorite, is now so extreme and irritating.  But back to the music. Thankfully, that is still great. Wonderful holiday music for sure by very talented folks. However, the one reviewer that insulted some of the greatest and most beloved artists truly shocked me. I read the comments several times, and still flinched. I cannot even begin to imagine that 40, even 10, years from now people will be listening to Kei$ha, as people still do listen to and LOVE their Elvis, Bing and especially Judy!  And what does Barak Obama have to do with a music review? The guy has enough problems of his own. Anyway, anyone reading this, enjoy the cd and Happy Holidays and Peace to All.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Great read. well put together, hard time putting it down. Connelly knows how to keep your attention while putting all the pieces together.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I was looking for a flash that was better than the built-in flash of my Nikon D3100. This one does the job quite well. It is small, compact enough to sit on the camera at all times, and effective. I made a few test shots with and without the built-in flash and there is a great improvement in picture quality when I use the SB400. It does not have all the &#34;bells and whistles&#34; of the more expensive Nikon speed lights, but for basic use, it works.
B005LAIISA|5.0|Loved this at the theater.  It will be fun to watch with the family.  Scrat is always funny.  Good for all ages.
0307891372|5.0|This thing was GREAT.... only thing that was a little lacking was crafting recipes.... but there's a specialized guide on gamefaqs
B005QUQ99K|5.0|My grandson loved it.  He put it together and didn't want to take it apart.  It is very cool.  Ninjago is a fun new spin on lego
B009KKLQVS|5.0|i felt good watching it from my tv takes away  all the hastle of driving and sitting on lines and paying extra money.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Love Gillian Flynn's books and this one did not disappoint.  A little disturbing, but oh so good!  Just downloaded another.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|My new favorite artist. There's not one song on it I don't like. Looking forward to hearing more from her.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Best present ever. You will watch these over and over.. They need more of these videos. A must for anyone. They are amazing videos. Anyone would love these videos....can not wait for new ones.....
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Please fix problem with older posts. Very annoying. Now in just filling up the word minimum so I can post my review
0547848412|5.0|I happened to pick this book up while on vacation at a family member's house.  It was lying on top of an open bookcase.  I flipped in a couple chapters and caught the plot just as it was moving into the shipwreck scene.<br /><br />COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN.<br /><br />It is so rare for me to find a book that engages me to such an extreme.  The subject matter is most dire and seemingly hopeless as to the horrific circumstances.  But it's so well written and suspenseful, you sit on the edge of your seat just stupefied as to how in the heck he's going to get out of the situation.  And the author does not disappoint.  Wow, what a story!  One of fantastical proportions -- from the mystical, to basic carnal survival and the ethereal beauty of a most unusual friendship.  I read it purely as an adventure and didn't really consider all of the religious and deeper meaning until later.  You can go as deep as you like on this one; it will keep you thinking for years.  It's been now, a good 5 years, since I first picked it up off that bookcase.<br /><br />I have recommended this rare read to anyone who would listen.  When I found out it had been made into a movie I almost jumped up and down, literally!  CAN NOT WAIT, for I finally get to see it this weekend.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|Looking for a game to help you relax? Osmisos, especially with headphones, does it for me. The gentle music and relative simplicity let your mind rev down from lifes hectic pace. Don't think this is mindless though, as you progress, it does get more challanging, all without gunfire or explosions. Quite entertaining without being overstimulating
0812550706|3.0|As a reader, I was rooting for him to rebell and kick some frickin' arse!<br /><br />MILD SPOILERS:<br /><br />I hear this story is being made into a movie.  I am actually looking forward to seeing the big screen interpretation.  It should be very interesting, especially since one of my fav's, Harrison Ford, is going to have to put on one hundred pounds in order to look his character's part.  I hope they put him in a fat suit; don't make him gorge on crispy creams... please!  I'm hoping that the big-screen adaptation will be a lot more exciting than the written version.<br /><br />Okay, putting that visual aside... I simply could not read this book with great enthusiasm.  It took me forever, reading a few pages at night to help me fall asleep.  It read like a space-war play book.  And that, apparently, is not my thing.  My hopes rose slightly when the story switched back to Ender's siblings. Their political play on the nets piqued my interest for a chapter.  But it just wasn't enough to get me fully engrossed.  Especially since what they wrote, was never included in the text, only alluded to what they were up to.  That is frustrating to the reader!  I also decided I was rooting for the Buggers at the end.<br /><br />I know this is sci-fi and not meant to be anything but fictional entertainment.  But it came across as a scenario that I could actually visualize happening in our Earth's future.  That's what turned me against us in the end.  If our humanity is to take a similar course as to what is portrayed in these pages, I fear our humanity is lost forever.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This post-apocalyptic eBook series is a real page turner.  I couldn't put it down.  As soon as i was finished, i downloaded the next in the series.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|My Kindle cord had cracked and wires broken, so I spoke with a live-chat employee who linked this cord to me as a replacement for the one that had broken, and credited the price back to me.  It's very sturdy, the only reason I didn't give it 5 starts is because it's not quite as long as the original Kindle cord, but still a great product, and great customer service from Amazon!
B000YHG72E|5.0|Love this movie. I watched it with my husband and then again with my daughter and laughed hysterically both times.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I have had my Kindle Fire for almost a year now, I always wondered if you could print with it...well you can this app works great!
B0091REZMW|3.0|It's an ok app. It has allot of bugs, sometimes won't open. It is a very fun game. To allow to regain energy. Other than that I love the game. And have it on my phone
B009CPJHY4|4.0|This movie starts off a little slow, but if you hang in there it is a treat to watch. I liked it, husband loved it, so I bought it for him for Christmas.  He said he wanted to watch it again.  The younger audience might not enjoy this movie as much as the more mature audience not because of its rating but because of the content, I really don't think younger people would understand it.
B006LSZECO|2.0|After hearing so many great things about this book, I was utterly disappointed. I thought I had predicted the ending which irritated me, but the actual ending was worse. Glad this was a library loaner instead of something I bought.<br /><br />The characters were \\"meh\\" and their stories not much better.<br /><br />Two stars is INCREDIBLY generous.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|There is nothing about this movie that I disliked.  It was funny and entertaining. The best part, I loved the music! And Johnny Depp is a great actor.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|This is a great CD, so great I bought the digital version and the CD version.  She has such a beautiful voice!
B008J9EYFG|5.0|I love Beth Orton and her new album is very good, I do prefer her older music though, but this cd is still very good and I enjoy listening to it :)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It was really hard to put this book down and I recommend you read it and move on to the &#34;prequels&#34;.  Great post apocalyptic series, yet you never find out what brought on the worlds' demise... that comes in the prequels, which so far is just as good of a book!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Relaxing and enjoyable game with soothing background music. Graphics are good and sound effects are a nice touch. Great game to unwind with.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Whats there not to like? Its about a grown man and his teddy bear, very funny. But some of the unrated material is uncalled for.....in a very funny way.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great read!<br />Kept me interested until the end.<br /> Time to get book three.<br />I hope it is just as good!
B005LAIIQC|3.0|The movie is not terrible but it is some what are to follow if you are not paying 100% attention. Its also what slow moving too. Not worth $20, way til is $15 or less.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This device is really handy if you need to sharpen a knife while in the field--camping, hunting, hiking, etc. Only issue is that it can tend to rust.
B009XY97VC|5.0|I'm a writer. A screenwriter. This got my hopes up that it was some off budget epic Science Fiction film I had missed somehow. Create this world. Write it out in a realistic and anti-campy style. Hard Science Fiction. Just looking at the album cover, a million and one ideas flood my mind.
034580404X|5.0|It is interesting to read, it catches you page by page. You can enjoy and probably will want some changes in your life...
B008RA3X5E|2.0|Sleep timer/ white noise doesn't work in clockface mode, nor does it revert to it when done.  Useless.<br />LED ghosting of 'empty' numbers fairly annoying- and how hard to add some other color options?<br />A few more clock face choices might be nice, but for 99¢, if the sleep timer issue is ever fixed, it might be worth it.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|It is a good movie to watch. I saw it on Amazon, and had a good time. I would recommend it.
B001P3SA94|5.0|This movie made me appreciate all of the sacrafices made to simply entertain others.  I loved Beonyce's portrayal of Etta James.
B00455IVHU|5.0|It is an excellent movie, and I truly recommend it to watch, as actors are amazing, and you will love it so much as me.
044042321X|5.0|I recommend this product to all the big fans of game of thrones. It is a bit different from the tv series and the book itself but nonetheless it is very enjoyable.
B00192KCQ0|2.0|i bought the album the day it came out and listened to it many times. i shelved it, pulled it out a year later, listened to it again, shelved it, and here i am writing a review of it. if you can get past the train wreck that is \\"the day that never comes,\\" james' metal-cowboy impression, the audio clipping during loud moments, and kirk's waning soloing capability, there is some good stuff on this disc. here are some things that should have happened during the course of writing music for this disc, recording it, and getting it to market: lars tells james to stop hooting and hollering like a damn country singer. lars and james tell kirk to stop doing improv blues and playing sloppy solos, or he can get the hell out of the band (was every solo on this record done in one take?!). rick rubin stops sucking as a producer and doesn't let a s***ty mix get to pressing - how many millions was he paid to produce this thing and get a polished item to pressing? rob should be continually encouraged to breathe life and energy back into this band. i am still bitter about jason getting the boot, but rob is a good guy and a good bass player. and finally, \\"the day that never comes\\" should have never come. it sounds like 3 songs by 3 different bands was slammed together by a surgeon who finished last in his medical school class.    the instrumental is a bit boring and i could defintely go without the unforgiven 3. everything that's left, minus most of the solos and james' cowboy bits, is pretty solid metal.    for the future: no more trick rubin or blob rock... they're not adding anything... i am still getting over \\"bob rock's black album.\\" kirk steps up his solos (channel some Justice). james is paddled everytime he starts to sound like a country singer. rob writes loads more music, not just the bass parts, for the next album. everyone continues to remind lars to keep those snares engaged.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Great game!!!!!!! Just like the original that we all love. Joystick use is great!!!!!  Brings me back to my childhood.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|was slow and acting is fair, looooong cat woman being good? wrong set up for robin BUT better that nothing and bat man was sick (not cool but should have died)  NEXT!!
0399160450|5.0|Ever since Tom Clancy started using guest author's to help him write his novels the quality started dropping, until now.  I have read every book from Clancy and I am happy to report that the old Clancy is back!  Threat Vector is an awesome read!  Definitely one of his best books in years. The detailed and informative writing that made Clancy a star has returned!  The original, exciting and scary plot was fantastic, especially, in a genre that has been watered down as of late.  This is the first book where I couldn't tell which chapters were written by Clancy or the guest author, Mark Greaney. If you've ever been a Tom Clancy fan you must read this book. Welcome back!
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows on tv. Its very original and the writers, actors and directing are phenomenal.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|This season and season 2 are probably my favorite! Fringe is one of my ALL TIME favorite shows! STRONGLY recommend!
1595828753|5.0|Loved the series so much that when I got the comics, I was so happy. The comics are exactly like the series.
0439023521|5.0|I am in love with this series. I was not able to put it down! Suzanne Collins is great at keeping up the suspense to keep you reading. I was SAD when it was done and could not WAIT to read the rest of the series.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes strategy games. It is a lot of fun and not very hard to learn. I also recommend getting the expansions to change up the gameplay a little and keep things interesting.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|Fringe is one of my ALL TIME favorite shows! I'm so sad it is on it's last season! STRONGLY recommend!
0062068423|3.0|Caustic critic Joe Queenan once wrote, \\"There is no earthly reason a mystery or thriller needs to be more than 175 pages. After a mystery writer passes the 200-page mark, it's all ballast.\\" I suppose there are exceptions to Queenan's rule, but not in this case. \\"The Redbreast,\\" Norwegian novelist Jo Nesbo's 500-plus-page marathon of serial killings and romance in frigid Oslo, is mildly interesting. The characters are ... mildly interesting. The sole aspect of this plodding novel to avoid a been-there-done-that sensation is its background theme about Norway's tortured history during WWII, a topic about which I knew little.<br /><br />In 2004, Norwegian book clubs declared \\"The Redbreast\\" the \\"Best Norwegian Crime Novel Ever Written.\\" Across the border in Sweden, I'm guessing that Henning Mankell suppressed a chuckle.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This cord has a great length.  It charges my Kindle Touch fast.  It took a while to ship - I guess it was on back order for a while.  It was worth the wait, though!
B006LSZECO|4.0|The first half of this book had me hooked.  I was a tad disappointed with the second half but not enough not to recommend it to others.  If you can buy it cheaper that 12.99 (what I paid for it) then it's definitely worth the read.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|Tengo varias semanas viendo esta serie por SpaceHD vivo en Santo Domingo y Realmente me encanta. me gustan los dialogos y la forma de los personajes tanto los Principales como los Secundarios donde las mujeres tienen ese don de hacer reir con sus comentarios e incognitas.<br /><br />La Recomiendo y La Quiero Ver en Blue Ray.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|Too bad this didn't get more media coverage. It is a great aviation movie. It also tells an all too familiar story of flying during a war. I'm proud that they flew. The challenge they overcame was great but they did it. They are the genuine military fliers. I wish commanders in the military backed their men that way today.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I expected to read the full story of Dr. Alexander's 7 day near death experience. Instead, I find that this book only had a few details of his NDE, and tons of scientific data that \\"proves\\" the legitimacy of his experience to the medical and scientific communities. If that's your thing, then buy this book. If not, then wait and buy his 2nd book. That's the one that will go into full detail about all the things that happened to Dr. Alexander when he was in the afterlife.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Great price and fast shipping. Did not have any problems. I love Savage Garden so of course I love this CD. I miss their sound and love Darren's voice.
B00AH34AUQ|5.0|I really like Green Day so I knew I'd like this. After I listened to it a second time I loved it - great music - great lyrics.
B009VB97EY|5.0|Channing Tatum is FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!  You can have a girl's night out in the comfort of your livingroom.  Fabulous bridal shower movie.
B003ZFCBJ0|4.0|The Last Song<br /><br />I found it to be a very nice story of young love and romance.  Entertaining and enjoyable.  It won't let me submit this and this will probably all disappear.<br /><br />This review does not work
B0058YPG1G|5.0|The character Walter White is supposed to be a genius, but he seems incredibly stupid at times. His attitude and ego are very irritating at times too. OTOH, Jesse, the \\"dumb, uneducated\\" character seems to be smarter than he first appears. Though he does some very stupid things at times too. But, the plot keeps the show interesting. Though at times hard to believe. But, I suppose that comes with keeping a series like this going so long. Kind of like Dexter never getting caught, if you get my drift. Overall quite a good show and I am still watching it and looking forward to the next episode. Almost through season 4 at this point.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|Really love these games. Love the variety of different bubbles you can get, such as the chainsaw that helps you in your game.
B005Y1B3Q0|5.0|This was a gift and I love this movie, the director's cut is worth watching and you can see that they wrote a good movie bevfore it got all cut up.
0670069019|5.0|The story is very exciting and suspenseful,you can't expect what to happen every page. A very new story model you never see in any of the familiar story...
B007ADIRDM|4.0|The doll and accessories are nice, however I ordered this because it said Coffin Bean and Clawdeen Wolf Doll Playset. I Thought this set came with both, but it only comes with the Coffin Bean doll. I ordered two sets of this on that notion so I will keep one and send one back as my daughter really wanted one doll over the other. Four stars as it is a nice to get accessories with the doll for as much as the doll is priced in some stores, minus a star because for the name I thought it has two dolls.
B008KE3960|4.0|Would give 5 stars except for the constant nagging of the game to be rated.  Excellent graphics, stability, strategy, controls, etc.  Very good game.
B00ANR2H4M|5.0|I watched American Horror Story Season 1 and loved it, so when season 2 came out I knew I was in for a treat! This has me sitting on the edge of my chair, waiting to see what happens next! Wonderful and captivating!
B009LZH5AI|5.0|The whole Howard in Space thread ise a very funny one, with Howard finding himself in the astronautic equivalent of High School, being picked on by NASA astronaut Mike Massasmino, who does a wonderful job of creating a character here. Meanwhile Penny is conflicted, Leonard is clueless, and the Amy and Sheldon relationship continues to develop in its own strange way. Plenty of laugh out loud moments.
B0012CJQY6|5.0|I'VE BEEN A WATCHER OF ALL THE SEASONS OF THIS PROGRAM. I RETIRED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND IT IS REALLY REAL! THIS WAS THE FIRST TV SERIES THAT YOU SOUGHT OF LIKE THIS BAD COP! HE'S A GOOD FATHER,BAD HUSBAND. HE WILL BEAT THE HELL OUT OF DRUG DEALERS SELLING TO KIDS BUT DONES HELP DRUG DEALERS SELL TO ADULTS? HE LOVES WOMEN,WIVES,WHORES OR YOU NAME IT.

B004QOB8SO|5.0|Benedict Cumberbatch is a hottie...unexpected but true. Loved this season Can't wait for the next season to be available. I love British TV.
1451696205|5.0|When I heard a film version of this beloved (yet controversial) novel was being made, I had to read it again. I first read this either in high school or some time shortly after that in college, I think. I remember feeling a sort of kindred spirit with Charlie, but I couldn't remember why until I reread it. Even years later, this book still speaks to me and will forever be one of my favorites.<br /><br />The first thing that caught my attention was the letter format Stephen Chbosky chose to write the book in. It works so well with Charlie's honest, young voice that you can't help feeling immediately drawn to him. He kind of charms his way into your heart and you end up finding yourself invested in making sure he has a happy ending. I think the author was brilliant in his ability to suck you in so well.<br /><br />Charlie is quirky. I really related to him my first read through and I have found that I still do. Why? Because Charlie is an introvert, he's observant and he's a bookworm. He tends to think and feel... a lot. He can also see that he's different, but he doesn't know what to do with that knowledge. I think a lot of teens can relate to feeling different. Some embrace it, others fight it. Charlie is also honest, almost to a fault. He's a little passive, but he will stand up when necessary. He's one that you don't want to make angry, though. It's always those quiet ones you have to worry about, right? Yeah, I can relate to that, too. He wants to make others happy. He always thinks of others before himself, which can be a good and bad thing. He's incredibly intelligent, sensitive and sentimental, but sort of emotionally unstable. Charlie is a loyal friend that will do anything for those he cares about. He'll go to the ends of the earth to make someone feel alive, once he recognizes the need to do so. I still don't agree with some of the things he does (drug use, drinking, etc), or the language used in the book. I know it's becoming \\"the norm,\\" but that still doesn't make it okay or mean I have to like it. Regardless of those few gripes, there is no denying the fact that this is a fantastic novel.<br /><br />As for other characters, I really like his teacher, Bill. He believes in Charlie, which is very important for a kid like him. He's able to see there is something special about this quiet kid and is trying his hardest to help him see it, too. I'm glad his sister started to get better. She was shallow and annoying at first, but improved immensely by the end. Sam and Patrick have great personalities. They may not always be the best influences, but they're good people and loyal friends. They are definitely influential in helping Charlie step out of his comfort zone and participate in the world around him.<br /><br />The Perks of Being a Wallflower is beautiful and heartbreaking and tragic and triumphant. It tugs at your heartstrings and demands you pay attention to it. I wouldn't recommend it for younger readers, but I think older teens and adults will love it. Solid storytelling and character development. A wonderful coming-of-age story that will leave you feeling infinite.<br /><br />A Favorite Quote: \\"So, I guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.\\"n't make it okay or mean I have to like it.

B008DVW7DQ|5.0|Jaroussky sings beautiful music beautifully.  Always.  An additional bonus are the performances that are humorous thanks to his acting ability.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Would read it again! Love these books! Once again, would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed reading fifty shades series!
B00006DEFA|5.0|The &#34;Director's Cut&#34; edition includes 20 minutes that was cut from the movie and seems richer than the original. The story is told effectively. Woven into the story are Mozart's unforgettable compositions, directed passionately by Sir Neville Mariner. The companion CD &#34;The Making of Amadeus&#34; documents behind-the-scenes action and commentaries including the intrigue of filming in in Prague, while still behind the Iron-Curtain. We learn how the long-unused Opera house, where Wolfgang Mozart conducted Don Giovanni was  tended carefully duri-ng the filming.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm on pinterest everyday and love it!  So many project ideas! I've built so many things for my daughter from this site.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is going to be a super gift for my son for Christmas!  He is truly going to enjoy ALL of the Batman DVDs.
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|I love this book - it is intense and funny and Clary and Jace are perfect together! I think Clary is a great character because she is both flawed and an amazing person. I would recommend it to any teens who like books full of action, adventure and romance.
B007N9FKCY|5.0|if you're old enough to LOVE the original Mario games you'll love this!  its addicting, easy to play (only 2 buttons) and good graphics!!!  definetly worth downloading!!!!
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Its a good action movie,and it ends with a sequel in mind.If you like the Bourne movies it is a decent tie-in to that series.
B009K916ZK|1.0|Computer end is wrong. Not enough information given to help a novice decide which one to order. No paperwork to return
0743298039|4.0|I'd been wanting to read this for a while & I expected to really love it. I liked it. I loved how descriptive it was in places. Most specifically the retelling of events at Angelfield. Feral children, a ghost, a couple domestics & two mad adults all knocking about in a dilapidated house, had me from the start. Unfortunately the equal time given to Margaret & her rumination on events broke the continuity for me. And I honestly grew tired of Margaret's \\"twin sightings\\" in reflective surfaces. After a while I thought she was soppy & melodramatic and a bit less interesting. Where I began wanting to know about the ill that ailed the Lea family in detail, I no longer cared. I think the twin theme was a bit heavy handed but am open to believing that it was lost on me as I am an only. I worked out the connections early enough & the ending for Vida Winter was no surprise but I didn't find that an impediment to overall enjoyment. I'd recommend this for a weekend read for setting alone.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|Love One Direction's new album sooooo much!!! All the songs are beyond amazing! I love them so much. It was a great buy! <333
B00000J048|2.0|They were really fun for a month and then the pegs on the white pieces that snap the gears into the boards starting breaking off. :(
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I love this on my Kindle Fire. Anytime I tried just going onto the internet and using it, it would always shut me out or wouldn't load correctly. With this however, it's fast, and reliable. I get my updates quickly, and am able to post without a problem.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Getting the hang of this bottle cutter is a little tough. I definitely had to scrap a few bottles in the process of learning, and I consider myself a relatively handy guy. The construction is a little flimsy, but you get what you pay for. I think overall, with a little practice, this device is worth the money.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|okay. but not too good. it needs some more-i don't  know, jazzing up, if you know what i mean. in other words... it sucked
B000X107GI|5.0|All that was promised and preforming well. I did note there is a freshness concern with battery shelf life and hadn't considered that in the past. I believe it may in reality be a non issue for most of us folks and these preform as expected.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great easy read with lots of twists and turns... the suspense builds, characters are easy to follow and a suprise ending.
