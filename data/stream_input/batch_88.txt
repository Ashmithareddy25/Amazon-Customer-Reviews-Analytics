B0035GWBL2|4|works well for what i wanted to do, nice and well made.
B00FH576LO|5|perfect fit
B009YZIO50|5|This worked as it's supposed to, and I had some trial and error with it. I've worked with the black Plasti Dip a multitude of times and it's a different consistency. I wanted to do my aftermarket emblems on my Mazda, since my car is a really dark blue you couldn't really see the black plastic emblems. I used a white base coat and then used this. It's thinner than the black, you really need to be about 6&#34; away and use light bursts, about 3 passes and let it dry in between coats. When it was finished and dried it's SUPER bright! It definitely stands out now!
B005N53AM2|4|I love this.. You can get this same cover at Walmart for $10.
B004TKP2BO|5|Fit perfectly.
B001UCMUEQ|5|Excellent fit.
B005M2248W|5|Does what it says & received quick! Awesome!
B00823FSRC|4|Excellent used it and it works great!
B000V9ATEW|5|Exactly what I needed - Just like the original
B00ANZHG4U|5|Great value
B00WVNNYQQ|5|Awesome looking front atv bumper.  Installation was easy and it is made very well.  This past weekend while riding at night I dropped the front end into a deep hole I didn't see and struck a rock.  This bumper not only protected my new Grizzly 700 but weathered the impact very well, only causing some scuff marks where it struck the rock.  I would buy this bumper again!
B00TP2NJAC|3|They look nice but are smaller than I expected them to be and were not that easy to install.  The screws that came with were not long enough and I had to get my own hardware to install them.
B0068EO9KO|2|Too small for what I was looking for.
B00069CN2I|3|They do not fit as well as I feel they should. I kept checking to make sure they were tight and they were a week and a half after installing them one flew off and broke when it hit the road. All this after a few thousand miles.
B000S2SS1S|5|Plugs work great...They say they are not suited for my dodge caravan.... but worked great for testing to see if my plugs were the problem; as these were much cheaper. Their was no static in my radio and the van ran just fine as well. I changed to the plugs my van recommended for it ; but I probably could kept these in. they are long enough to fit from a 3.3 liter farthest plug to the ign coil.
B00TZ8HT5M|5|Great sticker came very quick looks great on my truck.
B000C5G886|1|Could tell one of the knobs was 'trying' to be for my 1998 Taurus, but not enough quality control to make the plastic post female (surrounding metal insert) quite wide enough - and you can't stretch plastic!  Wasted time and money.  Had had a good experience with different set of Dorman knobs from Amazon for my 2003 Buick, buy this time NO GO.
B004VTFRWW|5|Very good fix and easy installation
B004I0HVO6|5|Perfect fit at a discount.  Took me 10 minutes to replace and it looks exactly like the originl
B00B7QF1BE|3|I can't say anymore at this state... Because I may experience other variance of weather... It's too soon to claim anything.
B0009I2OM0|1|Did not fit need converter
B001V8PRAS|5|Made my RV very stable
B00KQ81M94|5|Really does work very well. You have to soak it and use it a few times to have maximum effectiveness.
B00OQS91F2|5|Fantastic
B000BRJTZE|1|Had to retro fit. Didn't  fit right
B005TCCKDO|5|Just what I needed.  Replacement lid and it fits great
B00GKB7M9A|5|Completely satisfied.  An image of the product would have helped.
B0013THZ3M|1|might of been better if I got it
B007V2BO0U|5|Perfect fit 2008 4Runner. Protects the dash from the heat and UV. Not the cheapest but worth it!
B004IARSE4|5|Great product and price
B00V3YUKE8|4|good product they are well made, I put them on my 2015 F150 they took a little finesse to get them on, I think the directions could use a little more detail, and the product support line went straight to voicemail. other than that I like them.
B006B2XVB6|4|It fit great, fast deliver
B00VES3PJU|4|Fits very well like it wish the latch would like a different way overall good product
B000EVYGZA|5|Works great, small a fit in my book bag...
B00V5B3PRS|3|This was a great idea for an accent piece.  It is more than noticeable, and really adds a little something to the interior appearance.<br /><br />Why only give it 3 stars?  Two reasons for that.  The first is really just a subtle design issue.  The fit is good, but could be better.  I think the size is pretty close to being where it should be, but there is somewhat of a gap (very slight) between the BMW emblem and the ring.  I think a very slight reverse beveled end, both inside and out, would make the ring look as if it were installed by the factory.  You really shouldn't be able to see the ring slightly raised from the surface.  The other issue is the color.  Because these were designed specifically for BMWs, you would think the color would be in line with the current red interior (actually, the red interior for the last 7 years or so).  The current color is coral red.  This is not close; it is more of a crimson or blood red.  As such, I just chose to put up with the color difference.<br /><br />Change those 2 things: perfect enhancement/accessory.  Heck, if the color was closer/right, I would probably forget about the slight design issue.
B00546C8UA|4|great way to stay organized.
B00Q0CWJ1U|5|Nice smooth operation.  Works better than the rest of the windows.
B001NZ6F6E|5|perfect fit, no leaks after installation, cooling great, no complaints, excellent service.
B0006IX87S|5|good quality
B009DJLGAW|5|Excellent! Ordered about 2 months ago installed last week and works great looks identical to oem pump and works flawlessly. Delivery and packaging was excellent!!!
B00JSW6W3K|5|Nice kit and easy to install. Make sure to put rubber trim piece on the top of the metal frame or it could dent the hood. Other than that seems great all around. Sounds a little louder and I think I am getting about 1mpg better in town, I don't do a lot of hwy driving.
B00X5FPK0M|1|Guess I didn't realize it was just a cheap cover for a key pad.<br />Might have just been me :)
B00ZEULTLU|1|Poor quality lights are very dim. The soldering job was very poor broke 2 caps off trying to install. Poor fitment. Would not recommend or buy agan.
B004Z1JHHC|5|That was the product I expected.
B00AZPI0NE|5|Mounted on my custom RUCKUS.
B001OMNA1Y|5|Awesome!
B00UW3URP8|5|Cool looking cap!
B0067UA480|5|the right part for my car and is working just fine.
B00EQ26FPW|5|Worked fine.
B000O0E890|5|Excellent...
B010K8XPTE|5|All of of the decals laid on prefect and the packing was stiff cardboard so no chance to get bent or folded unless someone really tried. Would definitely recommend!
B000WK4EC8|5|Used this product before works well
B006LLB2UE|5|FAST delivery, and item came intact.
B009YY4TE6|5|Great quality, thick rubber mat, & doesn' slide. Bought it as a gift for a UofM fan & he loved it.
B00DES8K4S|5|Excellent product, fits well, fast shipping. Exactly as described and what I wanted and needed.
B004Y4QZNY|4|Worked good. The timing curve was different than my genuine Bosch 009. I had to sand down the shaft to fit in my brand new case while the old dizzy fit just fine.
B00CJ9O9BG|5|Provided as posted & on time
B0076D5OI2|5|Bought this for 2008 Weekend Warrior generator, perfect fix. True test next weekend when we really need it, but so far so good.
B00869ZJSK|5|Worked great!
B009D6S20C|5|GREAT RIGHT ITEM,  RIGHT SIZE,  SAVED BUYING A NEW TUBE!!!!
B00FEZ3W4W|3|I ordered 2 of these lights for my SUVs as I am a volunteer EMT.  The lights work, however the sun visor attachment straps were put on upside down on one of them, and cut through making them useless on the other.  In both cases, I needed to take apart the units and fix them.  Not a big deal, but not expected on a new light.  In addition, several of the LED's do not work in the panels.  Again, not a major factor, as it does not seem to make the display dimmer, but I expected every LED to light on a new item.  Overall, the panels do indeed work, but would not recommend them to anyone else.  I am certain that there are other light panels that are similar that can be purchased with everything working as expected out of the box.  By the way, other reviews mentioned very short power supply cords, I did not find this a problem, and only required stretching the cord a bit to easily fit to the 12v accessory socket.
B0007Y9EEW|5|Love these cranks, a million times better then stock
B004O844EM|5|Gave us some added space. Fit well on our Armada. Liked it better than the cargo hitch we currently own.
B009MAT1GI|5|Great product, great fit
B00VF62STY|5|The Voltage Regulator worked as expected with my Kohler Twin
B0016ZBP1Q|5|Great deal and Quick shipping!!!! Thanks!
B00G24AGDY|5|Great look and neat keychain...
B00D8IKH04|5|Worked out great, easy to install.
B000NPRTII|5|Very loud horn, needed on my motorcycle.
B005JZQULO|3|Kind of a disappointment.  The description does not state what material these are made from.  They appear to be some type of metal, they are in fact plastic.  I put them on my bike, they look cute, but as a habit I do not use plastic valve stem covers on my tires, I prefer metal.
B00PWG6AC4|5|Too big for my 2011 Silverado. So I gave it away
B00JF5QOGU|5|Received what was expected good product
B00Y8SEKB0|5|Great fit for my 2001 Suzuki Volusia VL800, Replaced the original, worn, weathered-finish part with ease.
B004AHB2HE|5|So far so good. Great charge now and keeping my gsxr 1000 running well
B009PJJI8M|5|Item as described, prompt shipping Thanks
B004X2B9LA|5|Easy to install.
B000VE1G26|5|It's ok
B0098M7RSE|5|Part as described, received sooner than expected.
B00RIIQVFU|5|Not installed yet. Did a bench test and they work great.
B0076QWTB4|5|Bolted right up and is made very wells.
B001U27N84|2|Works when it wants too.
B000EVWDU0|5|worked good
B0006IX7YC|5|I had trouble with my level sensors giving me false level readings, I have a crooked drain pipe from the commode to the tank on my fifth wheel Laredo and this swivel stick fixed the problem that I had.  Highly recommend!
B00SVEQA7E|5|I wanted a key chain to go with my pretty new Triumph, but not something that would bang against the paint or frame and damage it. This one is soft and durable. I will probably remove a few links so it bounces around less though.
B0050SFVO2|5|Great item
B007KPTN7O|5|Fit perfect, looks great
B000WJYMMQ|2|Item was functional, but not the high quality I paid for. Huge ding on the locking link. Not returnable to Amazon...
B00KPZECVI|5|Just what we wanted.
B00BNX81CC|5|Great product for a great price! Very easy to install!
B000C2OF98|5|great service compressor work great thanks
B00AO3AGCK|4|gave as a gift to my daughter and boy friend, they said worked as advertised for atv riding
B0001UZUW2|5|Works awesome at close range. A lot better investment than the fly tape I bought. Plus its amusing......
B002PQW6NG|5|Fit perfectly.  Vehicle looks substantially better.  All bulbs and wiring harnesses included, which is a plus.
B005LPR1HY|1|did not fit my alternator
B00CPZ3FB4|5|Received on time, fit was perfect.  Entirely satisfied.  Wear might be the only other factor, but only time can determine that.
B007V2BPOA|5|Fits perfectly and protects well.
B000TYVL78|5|Arrived quickly and a breeze to install
B0002F68OU|5|Delivered quickly, quality good, and does the job it is supposed to do....protect the AC from leaves, tree parts and wasps!
B00AYSUN5K|5|fits great and looks great
B00I5HRJ9U|5|great
B002OL5PP8|5|Worked just fine & keeps the car tote level.
B00X1LNOTE|1|barely sucks
B0006V2BI2|4|Used it once. It worked well when I used it. Glad to have it.
B01227UN64|5|The logos are good quality.  I found the original KIA Logos difficult to remove from a 2016 KIA Sorrento.  The front Logo snaps into the grill.  I took it to MACO and they removed it for $35.  The back Logo is glued on but does not come off easily.  If I were to do another one, I would have MACO remove the back one too.  I asked the KIA dealer about removing the front one and they wanted about $150 to do it.
B0000AZ9J0|5|This is what all the pro's use. I just bought a boat that had one side completely trashed from rubbing on dock fenders for years. After wet sanding 600 and 1000 grit, this really brought out the shine. Looks like brand new.
B00L2W04LA|5|2nd set of ghost lamps and they look amazing.
B00GSAUHB8|5|So happy i purchased it,worth it.
B00Y8CCGQ2|5|Easy to use and worked as advertised.  The product arrived with a charge from the manufacturer so I decided to disconnect the main battery lead on my truck (Ford F150 V8) and give it a try.  The truck started right up with no issues. I started the truck 4 times before I disconnected it.  It also charged my laptop on the 16 volt setting with no issues.  So far, I am overly impressed with the product.
B00RW7WNF4|3|Average quality. Not so Good. There is a gap and doesn't wipe properly in the Gap area.<br /><br />Updates : Excellent Customer Service. They sent another Wiper. Now i am very satisfied. I will buy again and again from them. Although i didn't update the ratings but they deserve My 5 star ratings.
B00K3ZX3D8|5|Fits perfect.  Thank you!
B00X1PRKEA|5|They were fine thank you!!!!
B00DPIFNME|5|Works awesome!
B003XWXW7K|5|uses less hook/loom around one of the bars then the OEM did and the tailgate bar that you have to reuse for rear window does not seem to fit well. one other said the straps were two inches short and was not able to use sunroof, I find that the snaps are about 1/2 inch off but that is easily fixed and at moment does not hinder sunroof feature. I was afraid that the dark tint would be too dark but that is not the case, getting alot of thumbs up now with the new top. Price was about $65 cheaper then I could get locally for same product.
B0031BFIR0|5|works great
B001V5BMZK|5|works great as expected
B004B8GTQG|5|Great product!!!
B000C5HXLM|2|The ad made it seem like it came in a set of 2. I only received one
B000HEBR3I|1|this is real junk,,do not buy this,,it came snapped in half, by snail mail ,then amazon told me to pay to return this junk,,,yeah rite..
B00CEK5Q30|5|I love this product.  Thank you!
B00EQMIN2U|5|I am very pleased with the brakes and rotors I ordered for my 2008 Chevy Tahoe.  My husband also ordered his rotors and brakes for his 2002 Lexus that's how I found out about Callahan Brake Parts.  We are both well pleased!!
B00Z5SCQ90|5|Perfect replacement for the old trailer side lamps. Swapped out and caulked... Done!
B00HSO0E20|4|just wish it had included hose clamps to connect with the other hose.
B009YMI9EY|5|Great fit looks good
B000C11JSO|5|They work faster than the originals. One screw hole didn't line up, so I only put two screws in there. Works great.
B00HJWSQ3U|5|It is what it is. I have a wheel chair lift an need to get my chair in and out of my vehicle.
B006QYT0TQ|5|Fit like new!!!
B00199JJ26|5|Purchased these as well as some Dura Rear Brake Pads.  Fit perfectly on my 2006 VW Beetle.  Have not noticed any noise/squeaking.
B00XYSZ1D6|5|Arrived quickly, wasn't as heavy as I thought it would be, but glad it's easy to remove & clean.
B001UG8S8O|5|Love it!  It was very easy to apply to my car and it is holding up very well.
B00374KJFM|5|Just as described
B009LIGHWW|5|Fit and worked as expected.Would gladly order from this vendor again
B00H9S71LW|5|Installed it within 5 minutes and use Torque Pro with no issues. I really like the small profile versus other less expensive scanners.
B00K7938LW|1|They don't fit on the head of the license plate bolt! Chinese bolts must be smaller!
B00029J4FQ|1|I have a 1981 Plymouth Trailduster. 318. DOES NOT FIT.
B000CMIW60|5|Fit as a stock replacement. Helped my steering shimmy from large pot holes.
B006EGAIJ2|5|I don't see how on earth these could collapse as others have stated unless used improperly. I was on a perfectly flat surface, on a level cemented driveway, and I centered these perfectly to my front tires of a 2010 VW GTI. I slowly inched up onto the rams and stopped right before I hit the raised &#34;end&#34; of the ramps.<br /><br />I even bounced on the front end of the car. No creaking, no weird noises, nothing. I know others will argue with me but I would easily bet that anyone who had these collapse didn't use them properly. They feel that solid to me.<br /><br />Just make sure you line things up perfectly and are on a true, flat surface. No gravel driveway, no slight angles, don't drive up past the stopping point, and keep your wheel centered. Don't forget to use some jack stands, just to be on the safe side.
B007V2CQP2|5|Works and fits wonderfully
B00JNL6DNK|5|Excellent product. Excellent service
B007VFERL0|5|They are perfect! That is all.
B008JZNPZA|4|A must if you don't want tranny sleeve wear and driveshaft universal destruction.  Is a Viberation Dampener to a Vital part of drivetrain.
B003UT5VKW|5|i like it
B00N34HQNE|3|Battery is completely sealed<br />Very good deal
B00R13F8WO|5|Fit perfect
B004BWU8H8|1|Had this for one month exactly and the lock broke. It is now useless to me and I am one day past being able to return it. Very unsatisfied
B005MZZ4TK|5|As expected
B00WXBYYR4|5|Great price for DuPont product, quality you can depend on.
B00UZYHYRS|5|easy to put in seems to be good
B00KTHYAUU|5|It Works! I followed a YouTube video to program it and it works great. Saved So much money. I have a 2007 Toyota FJ.
B002ZBPXGS|4|I have to say I was impressed with the package deal. Two of these cleaners alone at Walmart would have run 12$, would order again. I used it to clean my 2004 Acura tl and it did a very good job!
B005FG28K4|5|Paid $11 for something worth $111. I almost wonder if it was a mistake.
B005H41U76|5|OEM belt that fits 2003-2008 corollas w/ 1zz-fe motor perfectly
B004J0RGB8|3|There was one issue with the fan.  The plastic connector was designed cheaply and did not fit into the appropriate plug on my car.  I had to cut plug off of the no longer working fan, strip the wires and re-connect it to the fan I ordered.  After the small amount of re-wiring the fan seemed to work fine.  Aesthetically, the fan is designed a little different - only 5 blades rather than the 7 in the picture.  Overall would have been easier to just pick up the part with a lifetime warranty at O'Reilly's.
B00LWKNXMY|1|Don't buy... This company doesn't stand behind there product.. I purchased these lights and they melted my headlight housing and became very very hot. In addition they had Errors every time I started the car. These are not a good product and the seller IJDMTOY won't return my money or warranty the product. Save your money and shop elsewhere.... They are scammers!
B00230JYDE|5|goes with the Vapor computer.
B00068U24A|4|the continuity beeper can not be heard..<br />it would rate 5 stars if that worked correctly<br />everything else works good, i like the shock case
B00OP1VSRE|5|It was great and it came days before it was suppose to come
B00T1YADSU|1|After  two months most of the lights are burned, they don´t last as the vendor promised.  Don´t buy these, they are lousy, bad quality, good looking lights (that is the problem, they look like they´re gonna last forever, but they won´t.)   Nice, powerful, super white light.  Not for city driving, they flood a lot.  Came on time, perfect minimum packaging, no scratches, no parts missing.  Again, they won´t last 3 months, so If you need them just for the looks of them with the light turned off, it´s ok, but if you´re looking for light, these are not for you because they won´t last.   The real weight for these is 6 pounds for each 4 unit kit packaged and ready for shipping.  Watch this if you are an international buyer,
B005DTWWM2|5|Rear diff was making noise on my 04 gto, so i changed the diff fluid with torco  85-140 and added 2oz of this stuff and the diff stopped making noises, im happy with this product. Im new to the whole v8 rear wheel drive thing so the noise was bothering me, so i did some reasearch on gto forums and this is what everyone recommends and i didnt wanna take their word for it so i tried it and so far so good.  update: after one day of stepping on it, the noise came back, so idk about all this.....
B004GCZ4FY|5|I was concerned about the number of reviews stating this part didn't fit well and fell out, but I needed the part so I held my breath and ordered it. It snapped into place easily. I picked and pulled at it and it felt secure. I have been driving around several days, including bumpy roads and speed humps with no problem. I'm confident it's there to stay.
B00COE3ZCK|5|This is excellent for a Lexus RX 350/450H rear wiper. The installation was easy as long as the wiper arm is in the correct position.
B0081ZVBDQ|4|On my second bottle of this and for my 1987 Dodge pickup it's just the ticket.  The Dodge is old tech, no fuel injection here.  As such it has problems with ethanol in the gasoline. Since I have been using this, I do not having the runability problems and as a side benefit it also is getting better gas mileage than prior.  I will be using this product until I no longer have the Dodge or I move to a NON EPA mandated air quality area
B00X3YGHH0|5|Nice Pump works great
B00KTJ28RA|4|Looks good but haven't changed my original black one yet.
B003G32TJ8|5|easy install
B0007RDVHA|4|good stuff
B0054WGRBA|5|Works great no problems.  Good value.
B000C4YJBK|5|Good product, good service
B00JXW0S5S|5|super fast shipping! Applied well to head lights thus far, but I have only had the lights tinted with this material for about 3 weeks.
B00684TAYY|5|Great product!
B00GSAUHB8|5|Thank you for an amazing product
B0093NAAY6|5|This wiring connector set was a great way to complete my class III Curt hitch installation on a 2007 Honda Odyssey.  Overall I give this item a strong 5 star rating.  I have only one small negative.  While the plug end with the connection to attach to the trailer hitch wiring plug had plenty of length to run over to the spare tire tool kit door plate and back out when in use, the end that plugs into the factory electrical box was a little short, especially the grounding wire.  I was able to make it work, but another 3-4 inches of wiring on that end would have helped a lot.  The instructions are straightforward and the entire wiring harness is of high quality.  I expect years of good service from this wiring harness.
B00895BT3U|5|excellent
B001BZMOKC|2|Not recommended because the real picture is a different feeling
B00U1OBYNM|5|Great design. Easy to install! Saved me $400...
B00L263SY6|5|I use this as my starter switch. Works great! I've got several different switches of the same color so they all match. Great quality!
B00QN61SQU|5|it fit perfectly to my 1997 chevy silverado
B00HMRDPBK|2|Had to file and grind it to get it to fit into the column
B00170L4MU|2|It was a good fit. Just a cheaper belt, at least for my 2.5 jeep motor. It makes a lot of noise, but does get the job done, put my old belt back on and the noise went away, now I bought a gatorback.
B000NW6XME|5|Fit just like it was supost to. No fuss. Works as designed. Half the cost then at the dealer.
B00OSWUIDU|1|Total waste of time and money. Returned for refund and am out the shipping charges. Did not add any noticeable power or sound and the fit was poor. Also cost me about 2 MPG on the highway. Contacted K&N and they were uninterested in this fact, just told me if I was unsatisfied to send it back, so I did.  Update: I'll back pedal on K&N a little, they have told me they will reimburse my return shipping charge, so I guess they ain't all bad!
B000CA0MJM|1|My mechanic showed me where it was broken.<br />Still had to pay for reinstalling the old starter.<br /><br />This is why many people order from the dealer only.
B004N63S9W|2|didn't really get any stains out ...but did get rid of the dust...next time I'd probably buy Armor all.
B002NY5FHE|3|The picture showed I would be getting 2, didn't realize it was just a front/back view, so I was disappointed when I only got one
B0054TJYXG|4|I reviewed the other mirror. Same product as this one, so I'll copy the review.<br /><br />Had to loosen the nut at the base of the mirror otherwise they would not adjust laterally. Dinging a star because of the effort required to loosen the mirrors up. Be sure to do so before they get on the bike to prevent damaging your fairings.<br /><br />Apart from that they are great and fit my 06 Ninja 500 perfectly.
B001GLOZ6M|5|Awesome
B00KJ8L6BK|3|After only 2 months one of my bulbs stopped working. I don't know how to contact them about getting a replacement under warranty. Hopefully someone will contact me via this review. My order number was 116-2500305-7294642.
B000EQU0EG|5|If the cruise light on this switch illuminates when the switch is pressed and then goes out when the button is released, this is probably the part you need. A properly working switch will click and latch when pressed in and the light will stay on until it is pressed again to turn the cruise off, just like clicking an ink pen. This switch solved my problem and cost less than local auto parts stores that did not have it in stock. As others have noted, it is a simple friction fit and needs to be worked out of the hole by gently prying up each end with a small flat tip screwdriver. Once out of the hole, gently pull the wires only enough to allow disconnecting and use the screwdriver to press down on the connector latch to release the connector. Snap the connector onto the new switch and press it back into place. The &#34;neutral&#34; color is taupe.
B000C7S0Z8|1|Arrived damaged
B008BLFHS0|1|I was completely disappointed. First off the roll came crushed, which seems to be normal I guess. The I was hoping for my decal, but I looked I only got the backing with no decal. When I tried applying this to my BRZ fog lights there was glue residue everywhere. I tried the dry method first hoping that I could pull it off, but whenever I pulled back the film I would get large spots of glue residue and it was not working well. So I opted for the soapy water method, based on experience, another fail. I would still get glue residue when pulling back the tint to readjust. And yes I used a heat gun, and yes I have experience tinting, I have tinted many car windows with no problems such as these.<br /><br />Some people have had great experience, but I have not and I don't see myself buying anymore of their products.
B00EZUL6ZY|1|Horrid smell of gasoline which won't go away. I've tried everything suggested by the manufacturer, as they do,acknowledge the problem, and nothing has worked. Now I have a new car that smells like gasoline instead of new car.
B00877TP4K|5|Installation went smoothly just regret not getting them sooner cause I knew the latches were broken. The way I see is kind of a permanent fix even with heavy use.
B00NMPBMRU|5|This is a great light.  It is not one of the older glycerin filled models that leak and make a mess.  I very easily shortened this one a foot for the exact height I wanted to clear the garage door with my buggy.  It is very bright and fun.
B00Y94PKEY|5|Great product Ultra Cool, kept my Harley oil cool from home to Sturgis and back.
B0131GOKJQ|5|[[VIDEOID:a4b19cfd2e77f8649c4c2258b5550815]] This so cutie. I love it because it is perfect for my car. The lid when you open it it will close on it's own and it just fit right it's is thick enough, not thin. doesn't look cheap. Very useful for my daily living specially i used my car daily. It is just like a coffee cup that also fits in the whole where you put cups. I surely recommended this for those who wants their car look clean. when you arrive home you can just carry it and dump your trash in the trash can. it is not so big that it is so hassle to bring in and out. Just enough size for your daily trash in your car. Get yours now ! you will love this i know :)  I received this discounted price in exchange of my Honest reviews :)
B008G3KG70|5|Worked great
B00AKEM09K|5|I was a bit skeptical that this carburetor would work, but it did. The only adjustment I needed was throttle tension and idle. Also, my battery was dead and I didn't have a spare handy, although after 2 pulls on the rip-cord, it fired right up. I'm impressed. I bought this because the original one was leaking through the overflow. I had rebuilt that thing twice, adjusted the floats and replaced the needle valve but nothing would stop the leak. This new carb isn't leaking. I figured at worst, I could scavenge parts from this thing to rebuild the original (again). Luckily, that's not the case. So for a little more than twice the cost of a rebuild kit, you can get a new carb that just works.
B00KFN06O2|5|Have had good luck.
B0002KKISM|5|Just what I needed, could not find this locally
B00480KPLW|5|Having a jeep means changing headlight bulbs is a must. So what better place to shop than amazon! Great price, increased visibility and quick shipping. It all adds up to Amazon!
B00ZV0X46G|5|I think its great and believe he can do it
B005SZ9YN6|4|It's a little tight, but otherwise very nice
B000XBCURW|5|Works great on convertible top!
B000CC0IRQ|4|Skirt went of after one Day. Face does Not Look like a beautiful Girl. But I like it.
B012BVDZB6|4|Very good quality and finish.
B00ISFQAU8|5|Fits perfectly, well constructed.
B00CB8WM2S|4|My wife wanted one of these devices after seeing a rescue of a baby left in a hot car. Since we are a long ways from open waterways and no longer have toddlers, the likelihood of using it was low - my first inclination was to 'go cheap'. There are a LOT of cheap alternatives. However, in reading reviews of alternative rescue hammers, this one was repeatedly referenced as actually being able to shatter a real car window. No point in having a useless piece of 'feel good' hardware that can't do the job in that 1 in a thousand situation where you need to get out of (or into) a car. Have I broken any windows with it personally - NO. Has my wife even put this in her car - NO. However, I have greater confidence in its utility than my first choices in the $3-$4 range.
B0035B04HA|5|perfect size and no scratches after going thru multiple car washes. Just wish it wasn't plastic but metallic. Ohh well!
B00IO93OD4|5|Great price, Great product
B00A82LDHY|5|works
B00192JGN0|5|fit very well, the only thing not though out was the straps that go around the back of the tire. you must get down and get under you camper to connect them. sooo i don't.
B00VQUXXWA|5|These things are great. I tried numerous kinds with suction cups, only to have them all fall off while driving, onto my son's head sometimes when he was in the rear-facing infant seat. They also left awful suction moisture rings on my windows.<br /><br />The new static cling sun shades can go on any windows - double up on the back windshield or put one on each rear door window. They are quickly removable and do not lose stickiness either. Highly recommended!
B002XLHUQG|5|Must have for the RVer, work great, could not imagine a night with out them!
B00CEPV94U|5|Perfect replacement
B0013IR88A|5|My husband is a trucker and this works wonderfully.
B009GO6CYO|5|4.5 stars overall. I'll be positive and start with 5 stars and update later if needed.<br /><br />This is an impressive jack for the money. Sturdy, high-quality materials with a nice weather-proof coating.<br /><br />GOOD:<br />* Once I had my tools gathered, basic installation took under 10 minutes to swap out the old jack with the new one (just lift your trailer with a floor jack or on your tow vehicle, unscrew the 3 bolts to the old unit, swap in the new one and secure.) It then took another 20 minutes to mount and run the wire to the battery.<br />* Seems to be very good materials<br />* Side lights with switch (the red switch in the back that looks like a circuit breaker reset)<br />* Lots or range - I like the removable (and extensible!) footer - gives you many extra inches if you need it because your trailer tongue is high or you're parked on a slight slope.<br /><br />NOT SO GOOD:<br />* Yes, it is kinda slow, but be patient and let it to the work.<br />* Instructions are weak, but it's pretty basic so you shouldn't have problems<br /><br />OTHER STUFF TO KNOW:<br />The jack grounds through the mounting bolts, so you only have one wire to attach. Run this wire to the POSITIVE post or connector block of your trailer. The short red wire with the in-line fuse ships as a loop, which makes no sense. Cut the wire in half, then you can connect each end in-line with the black wire. It's not necessary because the unit has a built in circuit breaker, but I'd advise splicing it in as an extra level of precaution.<br /><br />It should be obvious that you have to pull the pin and remove the footer in order to put the unit through the whole in your trailer tongue, but I mention just in case! Make sure that you're installing the jack in a situation where you will be able to re-insert the footer (if not high enough, simply reinsert the footer AS you slide the new jack through the mountain hole, but before you bolt it down again)<br /><br />Understand that this kit ships without ANY bolts (reuse the ones you have) or ANY electrical connectors - just a wire. You will want to make sure you have a ring connector or one of those U-shaped connectors (and a crimping tool or pliers) to attach to the end of the wire for use in securing the wire to your battery post or connector block. You will also likely want to have some long zip-ties or something to mount the wires along your trailer frame.
B000C7S1JI|1|Not an exact fit. The new tanks have a squarer surface where the plastic and aluminim meet.  Old brass radiator had generous rounded corners that allowed it to sit into the metal surrounded rubber mounts. Top and bottom is the same. If I can return and find a better replacement i will.  Maybe I will get the original repaired.  Radiator is nice but won't fit without mods.
B00LIRRYG2|3|its ok
B0077CPV12|5|Eliminates the 1-4 shift the transmission wants to do at slower speeds . Dash light still  appears for 1-4 shift.
B000EQCXEG|1|This did not fit my 1996 F150. It floated to the top of the tank and read 1/4 but I could pull it out and raise it up and it went to full .
B001TR2F9M|1|i wish i can send it back and get the set of yellow one.
B008427D88|5|Arrived fast. Bumper pins/clips
B004ZQZJA6|3|The bug guard is constructed well but the plastic inserts for the mounting screws are crap they fell out when placed in the anchor holes even when the screws where anchored in. I put better ones in from hardware store now it is solid mounted.
B00A4ABF8W|4|The DA polisher met my expectations, it made the job of applying wax less time consuming. My only concern was that I felt the pads become soft when they absorb the wax products. I have not clean the pads yet so I'm interested as to how they will recover after cleaning. Otherwise a good deal for the money.
B005DKXWN4|5|great fit
B00BL6CECY|5|Perfect replacement and repair.
B00G6188EM|5|The tape is of supreme quality, has some thickeness to it and very smooth. The installation was easy and a great compliment to my red and black 03 cbr600rr. It's so reflective! As a motorcycle rider you need to be seen and this product I recommend to everyone! I will not be without it!
B004IV8NBU|1|This s*** does not work !!!! I have a 2001 Wclipes it don't work lmao a waist of money !
B002BFJ3YG|5|The picture online does not do this justice.  I love it.  I do not like the carry bag the strap is not centered and it's flimsy.
B0068G18E2|5|Had a set put on my HD Road Glide while at Sturgis this past week.  Incredible improvement over the stock air shocks.
B008XSGPM8|5|Fits perfectly in my nissn rogue 2012
B004O2SAU2|5|shipped as two packages. worked well once i received both. Thanx Cat
B000C02B3W|5|The best stuff, works really well in converting and priming light rust. Comes out grayish black once dried and set.
B00K696N9M|4|guuud
B006VEHO8U|4|I had one of the sheep-fur type of seatbelt covers but it always looked dirty and didn't match the interior so it stuck out like a sore thumb.  This one matches the interior color of the car and does the job intended make the seatbelt strap more comfortable.  I do have to slide it down sometimes when getting out of the car to allow the seatbelt to retract properly.
B00RVEEF36|5|Really cute. Just as promised! Fueling my inner hippie!
B0039Q0OYY|5|Will these fit 1996 impala Ss ?
B0012WHBSO|5|I used it to air up a trailer when I was moving apartments on a cold wet day. Fired right up and had the tire up to pressure quickly. I even bought one for my grandfather and girlfriend to keep in their vehicles after they requested one.
B004RCSOS2|5|They are yellow..
B0004ELKC4|5|303 is the best thing you can use on vinyl, rubber, and leather. Especially here in South Florida where the temperatures can reach over 100 degrees in the car. I apply it often to the dashboard and the leather seats. Resists cracking, fading, and offers UV protection. Forget Armorall. This is the stuff to use. Great on my boat as well. Only suggestion, buy the largest size as you'll find many, many uses for this awesome product.<br /><br />Unless you are driving a high end luxury car, chances are your &#34;leather&#34; seats are actually coated. Therefore all the Lexol in the world won't penetrate. That's why it's best to treat your Hondas, Toyotas, and Mazdas with 303. Don't believe me, Google it. Ditch the expensive cleaners and conditioners. Replace them with one bottle of 303 and you're all set.
B00QPQD1NQ|1|Junk!  Wouldn't start anything.
B000EDUTO0|5|Great product!
B0001MQ7E0|4|Just returned from an eight day trip and it worked very good. I would have given it a five star but it made too much noise when it was laying down. That could be fixed if tested by QC.
B007TY6UJ0|4|Mirror was bought to replace one destoyed in an accident on my 2005 Dodge Ram 1500.  Installation was easy and everything fit perfectly.  Can't tell the difference from original equipment.  There is one quirk in the power mirror function from original.  When in the &#34;horizontal&#34;/non-towing position, the mirror adjusts the same as the original equipment mirror.  However, when in the &#34;vertical&#34;/towing position, the power mirror controls don't adjust.  In other words, the horizontal position, the down button tilts the mirror down (as expected).  When moved to the vertical position, the relative movement doesn't adjust; the down button doesn't tilt the mirror down anymore, it moves it right.  This was not true on the original equipment.  Down was down in either position.
B00EBJ5EW0|5|I love it but could I put it on my computer
B00029WRJQ|5|My husband likes these mirrors. We use them on our 2006 Toyota Tundra double cab when towing our travel trailer.
B00OYSVJ5E|4|Good towels, I got these for my car's interior so I could color code by use. They are a light-medium weight towel and perfect for my intended use. Price was fair, and they work as I expected.
B00Z89I2OY|5|In the Philippines, our main transportation there is called jeepney. Its like a Philippine version jeep which is made cheap for public use. And there we have bars to hold. So it kinda suck to ride my friends jeep with nothing to hold. This weekend we tried this product and installed it easilly. And men, we go wild, I just hold to this baby and I feel secured. I am 240 lbs and pulling with my all but it kept stuck and secure which is basically whats it for. So I highly recommend this!<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: I Got this product for FREE or DISCOUNTED RATE for my unbiased and HONEST REVIEW.My opinions are of my own and never manipulated in any kind.
B00LBAC12S|5|Great purchase
B0024GIWDK|3|The chin strap is crooked.  Didn't  expect much for the price.. will be replacing!
B001G4Z5J0|5|Amazing quality, easy to assemble... One of the best purchases I have made on Amazon.
B009OTW646|5|I purchased this stuff because I saw a video on how much it foams up. The more suds, the better as it lifts and carries away dirt. Since it foams so much, you don't need to use much, about 2oz in a 5 gallon bucket for me. I also use it in my Gilmour Foamaster foam gun to presoak my car with foam. After rinsing that off, I sponge wash, then soak in foam once more with the foam gun then rinse. Great results, and the foam gun doesn't really use a lot of water so I don't feel bad about water waste. It smells like honeydew, obviously. This is more expensive than the Meguiars God Class car wash and shampoo I was using, but it always foams A LOT more, and works better so I'm ok with spending 3x as much (the Meguiars I got from Costco).
B0024E6QX0|5|Helps keep heat in RV since there is NO insulation in roof vents.  Also notice less air noise from vent above Bunk in Class &#34;C&#34; motorhome when driving.  Fit tight so they stay in place well.
B00496H4CS|4|Super, super easy installation; however, definitely do not last as long as a more premium blade such as Bosch ICON (which is what these replaced).  If I had never had the Bosch blades then I'd likely had been more satisfied.  I was spoiled, what can I say!
B003066NJ8|5|Great headlights!  Couldn't be any easier to install.
B00MUFTH6Q|5|Sooooo comfy. If they made pillows for my bed I'd buy so many! Loving this product.
B00065L2D8|1|The &#34;handles&#34; where you press are rubber inserts. It slides off and I ended up losing one.. Either superglue them on or tape them up so they don't slide off. Not sure if you will get &#34;shocked&#34; if it is missing, but I didn't want to find out.
B002P8SXLI|5|Installed it today and it works great!
B000CAVE1W|5|Worked great! Just loosened the tensioner and popped this on. Great price and equals OEM quality.
B00T9U58MM|5|I almost wanna leave a 4 star. The strap is alittle short. For an xl. I have to completely remove it every time I take it off. The fit otherwise is great the built in glasses work well.  I'm very happy.
B00153CUVS|5|I have Not hooked it up yet but it does look nice, hope it works.
B0045V8CKU|2|After a year the part that mounts to the car the paint has peeled off. I'm going to try to paint them and see if it holds up. the roof rack itself is rugged.
B006WPQMWM|5|Great design. Does the job. Easy to empty.
B00HJEGQQ2|2|I bought 2 sets to replace my tailights. ..they work good but 1 would not work properly. ..just like the white the flat end would light but the surrounding would not. So now I have 3 led lights in the rear and 1 standard bulb. Had much higher hopes for these.
B000B8JUGQ|5|it fit my car well and i wasnt worried about it anymore again.
B003SYXQTW|5|It's been three months and it seems to work fine.
B007LXT81Q|5|good
B000CO7NGI|4|Installed straight in to my CBR250R. Little bit brighter then the factory bulb and less expensive.
B0040CRTK8|2|works for 85% of the door panel on my WJ Jeep Grand Cherokee(2004), for the very top ones the bit on the end isn't wide enough to catch the door panel, and everywhere else it's *just barely* wide enough and really doesn't provide a great fit, this shouldn't really be listed as compatible with the vehicle.
B000BPSW7C|5|This stuff is the bomb....goes on easy and seems to last 4 ever!  Been using it for years and it is like Old Faithful;
B000IZ1S4Y|5|Bought as spares, have not used them yet but appear to be identical to original.
B008O0MTUC|5|As expected. It was shipped timely and good quality. Thanks
B000C913FA|5|as described
B00HS0H8QY|5|Great Quality, perfect fit for my 1997 Volvo 850 Wagon
B00B5ZYY38|5|Very great product would recomend more people buy this. Tom D.
B005V9NH7S|5|Add these lights to my Ford F 150 2006 it made a big difference. Truck looks like a newer model. I have received several complements on them.
B008G3YQT4|3|Be warned the passenger side mats do not come with holes to accommodate the factory hooks to prevent your mats from moving.
B008G1XL2E|1|Didn't fit correctly, 99 Toyota Corolla. You will have to customize the headlight brackets to be able to point them correctly legally.
B001GDEAP6|5|Well constructed and sturdy. Love all the pockets to organize and the Velcro flap where I can keep valuables out of site.
B00GHT8NM0|5|So the latch to our 2009 GMC Sierra had broke and we no longer could lift the middle console for the third seat in the front. This piece fit perfectly! It actually fit better than the original piece! So happy with this buy!
B000BUU5YU|5|Great addition.
B00J6C0DKK|5|So far a great purchase works well and better in price than many other of the comprable fans, plus this one had wheels to roll it around easily which most of the others did not even have.
B00VKNO7BO|5|Great product, very good quality!
B00C7XZV7U|3|Does the job.
B000CITK8S|5|Keeps the battery in my generator charged up for a few cents a week.
B008K8HGAQ|5|Awesome product. Easy  install. Sounds great. After 2 months noticed 2 MPG average increase.
B00064LQL2|5|Installed LED turn signals in my 2000 Toyota 4Runner with this EP35 flasher. Works Great!
B00F2NHVX4|4|I was never a believer in Grit Guards until I decided to paint correct my car. I figured anything I can do to lesson scratches the better. These are quite inexpensive and a good investment. There IS crud and scum at the bottom of the bucket. These don't fit in all 5 gallon buckets, so be aware of that. The Home Depot buckets will allow these to rest at the bottom, the Lowes ones they will sit a few inches above from the bottom. I think this is actually better as it leaves more distance from the crud and scum at the bottom. I have a bucket from Autozone that will barely let one of these go half way down in, so I use that for my wheels now. I got two for the two bucket wash method.
B00NW8KE8A|5|Fantastic value
B005CLM78K|3|Looks good but did not want to hold the latch rods in place, the plastic holder kept pulling out of the hole. I had to zip tie the rod and holder to the bracket to make it work. Has worked fine since.
B005PZMKZI|4|Look good and fit.
B005R27ZK4|2|These &#34;universal&#34; seat covers didn't fit my Honda Fit car seats. It was too loose around the headrest and couldn't cover the full seat without covering the seat recliner. The material felt cheap and doesn't offer a lot of protection. I also didn't like how the back part covered my built-in seat pockets. I felt like I could get something better at an auto-store. I would only recommend this style of seat covers for cars that have seats that look exactly like what is pictured. These seat covers simply don't work with seats that have a detachable headrest. And to make matters worse the return process was difficult. The seller refused to pay return shipping so Amazon support had to step in and cover the costs. Make sure you have your tracking # to confirm that the seller has received your return because the seller won't contact you or process the refund if you don't remind them. All in all this purchase was a waste of time. Please look elsewhere.
B00I12ZYIC|5|Use it often. Great tool.
B00ED46XHS|5|Worked perfectly :)
B000CFRZTM|5|Real nice kit. Includes everything! Easy install and works very well.
B00390BS7C|5|I used this on my 2007 Jeep Patriot. I'm so glad I decided to purchase this puller.  It worked like a charm!  It does not feel cheap, very solid and feels heavy.  Well worth the money!
B008YGPA7K|5|This shirt was a birthday gift for my son who owns a Ducati, he loved the shirt ,it fit good,nice soft material
B00429NKWK|5|This kit worked great. Only the top half of my headlights were badly pitted and yellow, but it still caused significant reduction in visibility. I used this kit (about 30 minutes per light to take my time and really do a thorough job) and I am VERY happy with the results. I think the companion Youtube video makes it very easy, but a couple things I would recommend (which I did):<br /><br />- Use plenty of water. I went through 3 large spray bottles. You should always have a constant stream of fresh water when wet sanding, so I sprayed with one hand and sanded with the other. Use plenty of water with the polishing compound when you notice it starting to &#34;dry&#34;<br />- Don't be afraid to use FIRM pressure with the 2000 grit sandpaper. It ascends in order or pressure for a reason (light, medium, firm), but you won't get anything out of the polishing compound if you don't use water and really firm circular motion when sanding. You'll be fine.<br />- READ THE INSTRUCTIONS: do the clear coat for BOTH lights at the same time. And really get that application wet with the clear coat. If not, you will leave streaks when you over lap. So, not too runny, not too dry.<br /><br />I thought this kit was easy to use, and I'll be doing my the headlights on my mom's car this weekend!
B00KGICIJM|5|Good
B009XQ12WW|5|Meets my needs
B007ZUGPJI|4|Some installation instructions would be good. Worked  on my old sportster but I think I put the bearings in backward... and once in, the races are NOT coming out. Good quality and allowed me to put a 2004 front end on my 72. Pleased overall. Instructions would have gotten them 5 stars. I know that it is pretty simple overall but instructions for adjusting the preload, etc. would be great. Races then bearing? or bearing then race?<br />Anyway I got it to work.
B007BJ79P2|5|Fits perfect, just like OEM. Quality seems very high, chrome finish is like a mirror. Highly recommended.
B003KFNAPY|5|Excellent shock absorbers)
B002ZBWKAU|3|The Slime Tire Inflator 40022 is a good for emergencies.  Inflation is quick and the noise is really quiet compared to other types that I have used. It is small and has a compact compartment for the wires to be placed in. The light is bright enough to light up the tire. The start button is toggleable, so if you will have to push the button out of active mode to use the inflator again.  While inflating I noticed that it consistently reads 1.0 PSI less than what is in the tire (tested with other tire gauges). It also tends to over inflate past the desired mark, sometimes by 2 pounds.  The instructions state that you should always use a second tire gauge and in this case it's no joke.
B00AWRYFYI|5|Love this helmet. Super comfy and great Options to wear.
B004MEES4E|5|Great product. easy to trim off bits to get a custom fit.
B0002Z9C9I|5|good deal
B00MRLRADA|1|Will not mount to jeep.  Holes not lining up
B00P74PMES|5|Hooked 'em up to headlights, nice bright blue, so cool...
B0027AJA98|5|Good kit with a wide assortment of fittings.
B000M5Y72A|2|If you are trying to improve the brightness of your headlights for night driving, do not waste your money.  Very disappointing results.  Check your voltage at the headlights and install relays if needed.  Most wiring insufficient to properly supply 13.4v at the headlights.  No bulb will correct that.
B008EMSJQI|5|Excellent quality ! Arrived right on time!
B006H34AE6|5|Great product for cleaning up dog hair! Easy to use and well-built!
B007WR25ES|5|Used this to travel to Seattle with family. It holds a ton of stuff!  We fit an extra large suit case and 4 duffle bags, plus other random bags and items and felt like we could fit more.  Once we figured out the assembly it was easy to use.  It rained pretty hard on us and all of our stuff stayed dry.  We used this without a rack on our car and strapping it through the car was fairly simple.  I am so glad we made this purchase.
B000GKEXK2|4|I really bought this for a test.  The Camry will take this in one place in the fuse panel, but needs the  low profile in others.<br />Either Bussmann doesn't MAKE the low profile version or Amazon doesn't sell it.<br /><br />BE AWARE:<br />1. The 16 ga. wire does NOT limit you.  It is short and can be shortened more.  Total distance (including ground side) determine what gauge will handle what amperage.  I am NOT a butt connector fan.  I cut it off, strip and solder. With 12 ga added you can easily go to 20 AMPS for 10-12 ft.<br /><br />2. The direction you put this in the fuse box determines whether you are fused or not. You CAN put this in and never fuse the wire.  The leg by the wire must go AWAY from the main buss bar in the fuse box.  Usually down the center of the fuse panel.<br /><br />YMMV
B005TMIKYM|3|Didnt last very long, the little motor thing that makes it spring back in stoped working and its all sagy
B008RNK8GI|5|Great product
B00S1EPV24|5|Not OEM, but fit and works GREAT for half the price.  I'll be buying this again (when the time comes).
B00HR26UI0|5|Night/day diff compared to stock lights. A MUST have!
B00CDT123U|5|Works
B001KS6FPK|5|perfect fit on my Mazda CX-7 and it works quietly and wonderfully
B00ZDZUPMA|5|I love this decal, thank you so much misty
B00KET8III|5|Best price in town.
B001N88E2O|5|Great for those long distance car trips.  Did a 5 wk cross country trip and didn't experience the aching back that I usually experience on long trips. Have now bought one for my daughter.
B00NGSRGTQ|5|This is the third time I've ordered this sticker.... not because of anything negative, but just because my husband keeps changing trucks and has to have it on his back window! Perfect size. Great quality. We keep coming back!
B007MUY76O|5|They work perfectly! What a bargain. A quality product for half the price they wanted at the auto parts store!
B006GLEBIO|2|If one of the tiny bulbs breaks the entire strands done for. Waste of money
B000760FWU|4|Nice heavy stands without much weight. We use them to make a &#34;patio&#34; out of the tailgate of our toy hauler.
B0041SMGLI|5|great price, fast shipping
B00K326BY4|3|The fill valve broke before the first use.It also leaks around the threads of the big valve.
B00OC9HMTM|5|Great 50&#34; light bar puts out a lot of bright light looks great also it was easy to install I did it my self just put the top down & you can do it all by your self or you will need another person it was worth the money you just need to buy a wiring harness I got a Mictuning heavy duty single lead wiring harness here on Amazon it was packaged up great and the shipping was fast..
B00CIB3HSQ|5|Cute!
B000GTX1D8|5|This item was shipped quickly and works great

B000C2WBZI|5|Great price and products
B00EN080FA|5|exact fit,and good price
B000BYEMEA|5|This product was easy to install and I was pleased with the quality.
B001EOV46K|5|protects and looks good
B0095TC604|5|Excellent towing mirrors. Bought these because they didn't attach with a strap. Once they are fitted to your car, the can be removed and replaced without any further adjustments needed. The shape is a little weird, but for the price and functionality I don't think these could be beat.
B004SL5FM0|5|Worked great for the power steering
B00O4DYQJ0|5|Work like they should
B00CSY1UMS|4|Very handy!  My kids love them.
B00CW6CBDE|5|They just work, can't complain

B004Q8L894|5|works great
B00X9ONJG6|2|Missing hardware when shipped!! Had to get creative and make my own bracket . overall I am very happy with them.
B004UQ00MI|5|Smells like a professional product and lasts a long time.
B00YB5GAEA|1|I Do Not recommend this product. It works well a few times and then stops to be rechargeable.
B0000AYFTV|5|it is what it is
B00SNVR8K8|5|Love it.. Fast shipping!
B00JFTC0T6|3|Not as easy to install as it appears. If you know what you're doing it will be easy... If not, you can end up with some damage. I didn't like the way it sat in there so I put the original gas cap liner back in.
B0013REXO8|3|Easy install - gives a nice look to tail lights. I would have preferred a more solid material -  these are purely ornamental. They will offer very little protection when off roading.
B001BNASPM|1|Unfortunately I took a long time in opening the package and when I did I was disappointed.  I bought set of what was advertised as &#34;Universal Floor Mats&#34; that would fit my daughter's Ford Fusion. Regrettably they did not fit and it is not universal as advertised.  If it is, universal, then it is not for a midsized or smaller vehicle.  The ad for this product should be updated to specify the size of vehicle it will fit best.
B001OD2OCY|5|It was exactly what I ordered and fit my HEI great. The wire leads are long enough to accommodate many wiring configurations and it seems to be made well.
B000F22XCQ|4|Nice fit, quality and price are good, happy with purchase!
B00NJ903MY|1|Work great then after 4hr they burned out
B000N4PW6K|5|Met my expectations.
B00KRI13TM|5|SUPER bright LEDs and a very easy install
B008D5RXX6|5|great product
B0006IX87S|4|So far so good, very easy to install, I'll be re-ordering if my garden soil improves!
B00BCRMBGQ|1|Didn't fit all the way
B0023W1D68|5|I love the look and it fits perfectly on my 08 cs3
B00MJDS3D2|4|Excelent
B006FQVHLY|5|excellent product
B00CMRSOVQ|2|Receive almost 2 weeks after deadline, lost several riding days. Fits on bike.
B004I0LYI0|5|perfect
B006MX81FA|4|It's fit ok with priusV,easy to clean.
B005CLNVUS|5|Arrived on time. Fits perfectly and works great.
B0007TQWME|4|They are a bit thin but work and fit decent.
B005ZLS2M2|5|Sick decal !
B00DO93SOY|5|SO HAPPY :) Made my 2014 5.0 sound like a boat! Deep rumble sound and loud when you need it but won't wake your neighbors when you're just cruising by. Exactly what I wanted--not overwhelmingly loud but aggressive. No drone at all. The black tips look really mean with all black enterior as well.
B003BSB7PU|5|Great product. Smells lemony fresh.  The tank smelt just fine when I drained it. Never got any bad odors throughout the entire trip. Granted this is just for grey water so shouldn't be too much odor anyways.
B004QHGODK|5|GMB wheel bearing assembly for a 99 F250 super duty 4x4  . Wheel bearing fit perfectly and comes with the mounting studs.  Hopefully it will last, time will tell.  GMB is a name brand of quality automotive products and I have used their idler bearings and water pumps without any problems.  This part is made in china.  Make sure you purchase the correct one as 99 is a split year.
B00681BDXI|2|It worked and I was able to use it with my car. The problem is the battery died after about 4 months with low usage, used maybe 1 day a week.
B00MS9ZM22|5|FANTASTIC!  ARRIVED QUICKLY AND IS OF EXCELLENT QUALITY! I LOVE IT!
B00Y4GY1OC|5|Very cool very easy to put on looks great!
B00TTNEIHA|5|Great
B00008RW9U|5|Wow!  Amazing dust/dirt collector.  Water rationing tool for sure!
B00V9SIENC|5|Very bright easy install
B0087NB0ZQ|5|the range on these will go about a mile with line of sight.  My dad and I use these for whenever we're riding together after work.  I'll use mine for listening to music, my gps, or to accept phone calls if I really needed to.  It was extremely easy to set up in my Scorpion exo 500 and my dad's HJC.  I'm still trying to figure out the dual Phone/device option though.  I've had this and have been using it for the past 8 months.
B0035UDHZ2|4|It does what it is supposed to, but not as packable as some other designs.
B00UW0HFXS|3|The design to great. Don't believe I can find the words to truthfully rate this trailer hitch lock; I will attempt for a different lock for my trailer. For the record I have taken this trailer lock off my trailer and placed it on one of my shelf's in my garage.
B005H12SZ2|5|Worked great thanks
B0113CG6N8|3|Very cool look!! I love them, for the price they are great, and give the bike that extra detail.  But.....one of the mirrors has a concave to it so it distorts the reflection of the mirror.  It sounds like a minor detail but this effects how close and or far away the cars behind you apear, and these mirrors are not meant for that.  The other mirror is perfect, seems to be a manufacturing mishap.  But as I said in the beginning they are very cool!!
B0054GNYX0|5|LIGHT BAR WORKED OUT GREAT.
B00BMJF1VG|5|Fit perfectly.
B001DR7VU6|5|Perfect fit for my 2005 Chevy equinox went right on

B00PWG6AC4|1|Total garbage. Would have returned but was easiest to throw away.
B008OIUI0W|5|Spot on!  Love 'em
B00WJ08ZP6|5|This is a nice chrome piece.  Beats having to get out a large screw driver to fill the oil.
B002PBPBFG|5|great so far but got to wait for the right weather to wear them. i do suggest getting them 1 size bigger than you wear.
B005O25DN8|5|Fit perfect.
B00QXGMBFC|5|Went right in and works great !
B00VS5LUXC|5|Very pleased with quality of item. Would highly recommend it
B00X1MZW84|5|These are very nice pieces and fit my bike perfectly
B00UCNCSJ6|5|Absolutely amazing. I bought this for my husband he's always restoring old cars, it jumped the battery one my 1990 Ford Bronco like nothing and he left it in an old firebird sitting in the sun for two weeks and with only 2 battery bars left it still managed to jump the battery without skipping a beat. Definitely a must have for the everyday mechanic or to keep in your everyday driver just in case of emergency
B000F3RYGA|4|great product , great service..
B004O7DBM4|5|Fit good
B00ELJ9A3O|2|Stickers are very small
B00PTTFE26|4|Well priced, good material quality
B008G4Y076|3|Basically they're cheap but a little dim. In brief:<br /><br />+ Price is great<br />+ Decent initial quality<br />+ drop-in replacements, no fit issues or system complaints<br />+ LED lifespan (should outlast the car) and low power draw (not able to provide specifics here)<br />+ Decent color temp: colder than filaments. not overly blue. HID-ish<br /><br />- overall light output is noticeably lower than incandescents they're replacing (see pic)<br />- tighter spread pattern is a slight bummer for reverse lights<br /><br />So they're ok. I'm attaching a photo of the light cast by one of these (right) and the standard incandescent it replaced (left) so you can see the difference in brightness and color temperature. I'll be keeping them because I can (in theory) forget about burnout, and they draw less power...but if they fail I'll be looking for a brighter option.
B00KGID5YY|5|All good! '
B00BRN5XV0|5|Fit as described. Would buy from again.
B00IRVF3EW|5|Received as described and earlier than expected. This is the best product and price.[Get 6 at app $10 each]. Great for keeping one and giving others for gifts. Check prices and reviews for single units.
B00G6IPN5M|5|Excellent Product Perfect Color
B00ZVYXGN8|3|Look to be made as well as anything else coming out of China these days.I ordered an XL and would bet that they are closer to a Medium compared to all other gloves. Will be sending back.
B00KSL6TQA|5|Great product. Prompt delivery.
B004NBRLZY|5|It works great. Easy to install. Just make sure you have the fuel pump lock ring removal tool to remove thw old pump. The tool is made by lisle, lisle part# 63000. It will save to from destroying the lock ring. Also if you have some channel locks that go up to 8in opening you can use that too.
B000C8XRHS|5|Bulbs came as described. Installed them and they are brighter and put light farther down the road.
B00ORY0SL6|1|Product DOES NOT WORK !!
B004L06UQS|1|I purchased this product at Sears. The fibers fall out easily leaving blue fibers everywhere.
B00265M9SS|5|This worked fabulous with the food saver regular and wide mouth jar sealers!! It came really quick which is great considering I am up real north in BC.
B000RK8QP4|2|case broke o rings all over shipping case had to find new storage container
B00KMYYTJM|5|303 keeps the upholstery on our boat soft and supple and looking like new.
B00I7EKRC2|4|Exactly what I needed, and a good price.
B0068SYSP6|5|Awesome fit and quality would definitely recommend this&#62;
B00CDD9EC2|4|no problems all the sizes needed
B00JINPJD8|5|This works perfectly in a silver bucket that I got for $3 at Lowes. 3 gallon I believe, perfect size for washing a car.
B00WH1ZC80|5|They worked very well. Easy to install. I put them in my Ford pickup and they were a little short but workable. Will buy again for my other pickup.
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|Very pleased with this item! I would recommend it.
B001AIZ5HY|5|Used product on 3 vehicles. I didn't use wax after use, but the product seems to have held up.
B000BNZ7JK|4|Good replacement bumper but don't forget to get the mounting kit !!!<br />Bill
B00IDSIC1U|5|Excellent little pack of lights. They are bright and use very little power. I put 4 on my zero turn mower (2F+2R) and two on the rear of my farm tractor for work lights. And still have two left over for whatever.
B00EEM8534|5|Perfect..husband loved it!!
B00VBPKII2|4|Nice set.
B000E4U1CY|5|I was glad to order my door handles at a good price.
B00F8LEB9W|5|Even came with instructions! Works great.
B00RM327NG|5|I bought it because of a terrific price, and honestly, it works better than I expected it to!  Don't worry about it holding your phone, as long as you don't have a heavy case (usually because of an extended battery).  As a side benefit, if you live in a hot area, not only do you have your phone within eyesight, but it's also blocked from the sun by your dash, and your air conditioner is keeping the phone extra cool.  It holds the phone firm, but it's easy to remove the phone.  Easy buy.
B000BLKV9S|4|Great for cheap
B011AL54OY|5|These are great, they fit my BMW 328i sedan. Shipping was fast, it came before the arriving time!
B000EALHHG|1|Didn't take any oil stains out of a vinyl floor covering in the garage. Worthless junk
B00KPWB1KQ|5|Good fit nice product
B00UVSFRBI|5|They fit great!
B003YJLAIK|4|Well worth the money and gives the option of setting the pressure to what you feel your system will tolerate.
B00HS0HDPA|2|Not as good as expected, the original  stock brand were more stiff and these Sensen shocks are more bouncy. If you are looking for a quick fix then go for it. Otherwise just wait one more pay check and buy aftermarket.
B00BVL7LUY|4|Nice product. Makes disconnecting electrical connections much easier.
B005H13BR6|5|Just as good as original equipment and easy to install.
B00HE682ZS|4|quick and easy way to repair small paint defects
B008DQV88Q|5|Top notch quality, these combined with hella 55/65w bulbs provided a very notable improvement in a 1992 Mazda Miata. Ecodes are what we should have here in the US, not DOT. There is less glare to oncoming traffic, and the beam pattern is far superior for the driver of the installed vehicle.
B000C0UN3W|5|Exact fit for my 1971 Toyota Corolla with 2TC engine.  Dayco makes good stuff so this hose should last quite a while too.
B0002SRJDG|4|great price
B001EQJ956|5|Solid gloves for a good price
B009DJOYMY|5|What's to say other than it was a replacement
B00KTJ956M|4|My girlfriend wanted her remote in pink.  Easy to put the guts in and no problems with the casing so far.
B00IOU1BPQ|5|Love this intake. Looks an sounds awesome. Fit perfectly and really makes a little more power.
B00A5UEOLG|5|Best addition to my Tacoma... no scrambling looking for small things that I need.
B009SGHN5C|5|Very good quality and very easy to install. Instructions are spot on!!!<br />Love the sound of my exhaust now!!!😃
B00757DT04|1|Does not fit 01 4Runner
B007VR61CG|5|Works great
B005T44BX4|1|Not happy with the product the hardware provided with the mudflaps' are countersunk wood screws ...
B005JZSP08|5|This works great I am short so this allows the harness to cross my chest and not my throat.
B00THJCEJU|5|Works great
B010MHV00O|4|Great idea!
B00BFDFEWU|5|perfect fit!
B00P0R1T58|5|Good price and good item

B00KCQSOAA|5|great i love them in my corolla 2015
B00B21R0TA|4|I had done some research on retrofitting headlights prior to purchasing these Nilight Bixenon Projectors. There are more expensive units out there that come hand-tuned, but I had gathered that no matter which H1 projectors you choose, some tuning would probably be required to make the beams cutoffs more even. The shafts to the Nilight projectors are longer, thus causing the beam cutoff to be a little bowed (instead of flat). But the quality overall is good for the price you pay. I eventually went with these due to the fact that my car is more than 12 years old, and spending money on a higher-priced retrofit would be a little much IMO. I just wanted to get away from halogen units and a drop-in HID kit that causes glare/blinding issues.<br /><br />The first set I purchased had a pretty noticeable bowed cutoff from both projectors, and the cutoff wasn't as crisp as I would've liked. Also, one of screws to the bulb holder stripped easily. I returned those units and purchased another. The second set had noticeable improvement in cutoff clarity and less bowing.<br /><br />Some Install Tips: Be sure to test the cutoff shield solenoid (use a 9-volt battery to the two leads and let the shield flip down 30-40 times to make sure it doesn't stick). Also be sure to not tighten the lock ring until you are 100% sure of the aim. Only hand tighten when tuning the projectors.  You can test to see if adding washers between the projector bowl and lens will help with bowing ad cutoff beam color/flicker/sharpness. Once they're tightened all the way, the aluminium threads almost meld together. Lastly, be sure the bulb seats properly into the bowl or hot spots will be in the incorrect position.<br /><br />Overall, after returning the first set, I have been impressed with these Nilight Bixenon Projectors. They give noticeably better performance over conventional halogen units. Having clear lenses result in a sharper and more colorful cutoff. The inclusion of the Mini Gatling Gun Shrouds is a nice bonus. But as stated in the Q&amp;A section, be sure to buy eight of the #4 X 3/8&quot; screws to secure the shrouds to the projector units. In addition, I have purchased two more sets of these projectors as retrofit projects for other people, and the beam patterns were not all the same. Some cutoffs were a little blurry, while others were slightly bowed. If you know how to tune them, I would not hesitate to purchase these for a budget retrofit project. But if you're going to leave them as-is it might be a crapshoot to get two projectors that have even sharp cutoff.a nice bonus.

B003JLCK50|5|My husband loves it! It has a spot for everything and the size is great
B001PNHBW6|4|Would have been a five except I must have ordered a maintain when I really wanted a momentary.  Probably my fault.  Great switch to use as it's proposed.
B00J2CI3L0|1|Bought these to use as fog lights on my 2000 F150, they worked well for maybe a month or two. After that the LED's began going out and would constantly flicker. Definitely don't suggest these bulbs for same or similar applications..
B00R98ALSM|1|Not the correct fitting for a 2006 RAV4.
B00T47K604|5|Work great!
B00OXBTWK6|1|The Key chain fell apart within a week from purchase, almost lost all the keys attached to it.
B003BZQ6OU|3|Pull rivets fine but do not ratchet for a second pull very well, and they won't release the stem.  Have to stick a pin in them to push out the stems. Not very convenient. also they came with 4 different size tips but there is only room for storage of them for two, one will probably get lost eventually.
B00JH12DTY|5|Very authentic. Well worth the price.
B001FC8X3I|5|These worked great for the drapes I made for our motorhome.
B009W65F9O|3|Good on flat surfaces
B000765E12|5|Easy installation, nice hitch.
B00GU2QST4|5|Great lights.  Not as bright as the factory halogen bulbs.  These went into a 2 seat convertible, so I wasn't looking for brightness just character.
B004GD9AA8|5|Perfect replacement for driver side front door on mt 1995 Chevrolet Suburban. I wish they had included a sheet metal screw which is required (the original handle uses a rivet that must be drilled out) but the quality of the handle feels as good as the original. The original lasted for almost 20 years - hopefully this one will last the rest of the life of the truck.
B008DIZ1S2|5|Perfect. Love it.
B001WZPRPU|3|Ok
B0001MQ7E0|4|Works great
B001T6F81A|5|ARP - works like it should,
B00OBQVDIC|5|Fits as planned.. Looks great and love they give u two incase u mess up the first one.
B003CMZBFW|5|Were super easy to install and my sled handles like a dream.  When these eventually need to be replaced, I will go with another pair.
B00PQWN5DQ|5|Lovin it, great tool and easy to use. Havent had a problem yet.
B00FRHOLK6|5|GREAT wipers and easy installation.  I will purchase again and recommend to others.  Product was shipped and arrived quickly in great condition.
B00NX8EYFI|5|Very well made.
B002OKFB0I|5|Were super easy to install and my sled handles like a dream.  When these eventually need to be replaced, I will go with another pair.

B004PBXUGG|4|The part was easy to install. And I love the way and how amazon makes it so easy.  The quality is perfect. I would  recommend!  to anyone.
B00LKK5E6Y|5|Quite the hit!!!  Was a surprise gift for a Star Wars fanatic!!
B002307UIU|5|Great fit and it looks ten times better than my stock color.
B005DLLVMW|1|The the check that was recommended for this pin to not good together? Only one hole in the jack with ass needs two holes I'm not sure why they would put these two together I had to get a drill and make my own all very odd
B00ATRV3Z0|5|Perfect fit and delivery

B00XVQ7GIE|1|I have not been able to use the product because it lacks instructional manual and I can't get a reliable guide online

B00TUJXQY4|5|well made
B001PNAOXO|5|guuud
B0002U2V1Y|5|I was a bit skeptical but for the price I thought I would try it anyway.  The clay bar system was very easy to use on my 2008 Acura.  This is a car that is my daily driver and I don't ever wash it or wax it.  After I washed the car I did in fact feel containments on the surface of the paint so I had a good starting point, I followed the directions keeping the clay bar wet using the included spray bottle.  I got to admit that after going over the whole car, the containments were no longer present.  I washed the car again and then applied a coat of wax.  The car looks and feels brand new with the exception of the obvious paint chips and other wear and tear.  The car has 100k miles and looks almost brand new.<br /><br />I will use this product again
B000FW7V50|5|GOOD
B001FHMNHU|5|This part works great.
B00AC5WX8U|5|bueno
B000IYPS00|5|Looks well made and cools my engine very well. Hope it lasts a long time. Will update if anything changes but so far so good.
B00KTIDLGI|5|Works perfectly and for cheaper than going to the dealer.
B00D2PLR0C|1|DOA, dead on arrival no lights, charged it overnight and still nothing. returned for refund and will not buy another one. Cheap feel to it and poor directions.
B00B27IWGE|5|High quality metal. Screw caps are solid and haven't come off yet.
B000R9VMRO|5|very good
B002EO2AW6|5|great product
B00FDUQCN6|5|WORKED AS ADVERTIZED
B00GSAUHB8|3|It is a little floppy.  To much material between metal circles.  Takes a little more time to install.  Seems to work OK.
B0038AYV0Y|1|I love the emblem,, but this is my 3rd one. the colors on the emblem fall out. have to find them on the ground and crazy glue them in.

B002WP362U|4|Works great, but 30 feet goes quickly, consider purchasing more than one roll.
B002VMSJ8U|5|Wow... absolutely gorgeous design! The vinyl material is very high quality, and the sticker is easy to apply. Looks beautiful on my new computer case.
B00JKI2EW0|5|Fit snugly and perfectly,  attractive and durable.  We'd buy again.
B011NT1PE6|5|Super Bright and the high/low beams work perfect. I haven't had a chance to use them for very long. But they are brighter than my Rhino Bulbs.
B01078GH6A|5|This bag is the best I've found in my lifetime for the car.  It doesn't get in the way on the passenger side of the car, it's very sturdy and well made and it looks better than a plastic bag.
B002ZS4QCS|5|Love this nice little hooks. It allows me to keep my grocery from running around back seats and they even look great with a distinctive elegant touch. Will buy 2 more sets for my kids car.
B0009IQZQG|5|Accurately described with prompt shipment.
B00M9DCMNE|5|Nice for the price

B008BC8G7S|1|Neither mirror will reflect properly. Passenger side I was able to adjust by putting washers behind the nuts but drivers side is too far off. I do not recommend this product.
B0000UZ514|4|I love that it sits right behind my console.  It stays in place and is waterproof.  I wish it were slightly bigger so it could hold more trash
B00B5IZIOY|5|very accurate,l fit perfect... thank you
B002XFU8KC|5|Merchandise arrived in optimum condition. The packaging was excellent and provided the product with very good protection. On regards to the product itself, it was a perfect fit for my truck. The quality is outstanding and sure beats the price of the &#34;genuine&#34; one!
B00EW3GRCQ|4|Worked great on my Saab 9-3 aero xwd
B00HDERBLC|2|Received this unit today and immediately hooked it up to a new deep cycle battery to test.  The inverter part seemed to work fine, although I only tested it by hooking up a 60-watt trouble light and a jig saw at the same time.  No problems there.  The 5 volt USB charging port did not work, though and the fan is pretty noisy.  I have already boxed it up and initiated a return for credit and ordered the 1100 W Krieger unit. Update:  I received my refund immediately after Amazon received notice I had dropped it off at the shipper.
B004A6JA2O|5|Noticeable air improvement.
B007POF798|2|Does not fit the sun visor. Doesn't stretch out enough.
B000HZUXNW|3|Hangs down and away from the seat.  Back passengers really hate it!
B00VGL6O3Y|5|Love the locking ability of the receiver pin
B004BTL68Q|1|Coil lit up like a Christmas tree. Absolute piece of junk.
B0081SCTHU|5|I was distressed about having to spend $180.00 to $285.00 locally for a alternator for my boat. I was also a little apprehensive about the very low price of the one I ordered from DB  until I received it. The shipping was extremely fast and I don't know how to explain the quality. Side by side I could not tell the difference between the OEM alternator. The alternator came with a computer printout showing the test results for this particular unit and being identical in every aspect made installation a breeze. I now have roughly 50 hours on the alternator and it is preforming flawlessly outputting the same as the OEM on engine two.
B000NCOKZQ|4|This does the job it is intended for OK
B00KG14L5I|5|More than enough ski cover to fit on the Yamaha  1994yr,stays on with the high  wind coming off the lake. So far so good.
B00GUF74HQ|3|Last 2 week thats it the piece goes on tailgate came loose but guys atdee zee where nice enough to send me new one and this one is about to do the same thing to me nut part is not strong enough to handle wait of ram tailgate.
B006VDHR5G|5|Worked great to add shelving in the back of my boxtruck
B0041CG7KA|5|Easy to install and works as expected...hot wired directly to the battery...!
B005ZWM0R4|5|Cool way to work on the cars.  Lots more information than a sixty dollar scan tool. Perfect use for old Vista laptop. Highly recommended.
B0096S9HXS|5|Works great!  That's why I bought one replacement for my wife's Saturn '95.  Today I got it working.  Didn't work 1st time but then I tried again.
B000FW2MCM|5|I like this very much and fitted to my Goldwing really compliments it
B004GCGLQ0|5|The part fit great. Surprised how easy it was to install
B007U7PW72|5|Fun- put it on my car window on the outside, has been there for about a month and still going strong.  No fading or peeling.
B00CN8GU7Y|3|Only one arm rest came with the set and it did not fit.
B00NUA30SG|5|worked great
B00P4XS8I4|5|i like it for my pit bike
B004UBCKYY|5|Greatest tweezers made big enough to hold on to tip is small enough to get the littlest splinters
B00N509LCU|5|A necessary tool for anyone with a car!
B000M5Y72A|5|worked great
B007QQRKXG|4|Nice selection, very useful kit!
B0041CAJ68|5|very nice quality and fits perfectly...just think it was a lot over priced...!
B009B45P3S|1|Less than 10K miles and needs to be replaced again
B00TZF06VO|5|excellent price for just the parts needed to repair my opener.
B00HWIZO6I|5|In Colorado we heat our house in the winter by using our fireplace, so our leather couch takes a significant hit with ash and the heat.  I'd been using a conditioner that we got when we bought the couch, about 8 years ago.  It was just ok.  I used the Nova Leather Conditioner on it for the first time yesterday, and it looks like a new couch.  The leather feels softer, and the color is deeper.  I am extremely pleased with it.  It comes with a little sponge to apply and is very easy to do.
B002E571UQ|5|works great easy to instale
B001PCQ9KM|5|It's a good product. Barely any evidence of manufacturing processes anywhere... The quality is good.
B004C444HK|5|Awesome leathers & great vendor
B00KQPEX4S|1|I upgraded from Winegard Sensar IV.....got less channels....and the channels I got faded in/out.
B00BNX8A1O|5|Fits perfectly like it's supposed to
B00W6KEWEW|5|no problems-thank you!
B00XAS406E|4|Plastic but seems to be well made. Haven't put it on my car yet. Will update once its on for a while
B008Z4SD4S|3|I loved the look of these! Would have been a perfect addition to my bike if they had fit. What they dont tell you is if you do not have factory handlebars the will not fit. I called into customer service and they explained aftermarket bars sometimes have an extra layer of chrome. the recommended I grind down the handlebars at the grips to make these fit. No thanks on a pair of handlebars I just spent 600.00 on! They did allow me to return them though.
B004JCE9E8|5|Fits perfectly like it's supposed to.
B000CQBNJY|5|If you want a big red funnel this is the one.
B00ZOFXS1Y|5|This isn't a tool that you'll use everyday unless you're a mechanic.  So you don't necessarily need the most expensive tool available.  This worked like a charm.  Solid, no frills, no problem.
B003PJGCE6|5|Fit grete install no fuss. Less than 1hr
B005RA6XXG|4|I'm fairly happy with this item althouth the quality is not fantastic but does the job
B00FB8409S|1|cheap garbage
B000C5DUN2|5|Easy installation, looks and works like new. Very happy to finally have nice looking switches and cruise back in working order.
B000E28C8G|5|Great filter. My husband stole mine for his bike, since it fits both of our bikes. He loves it and has no problems with it.
B005I59IDM|5|Fits my car windshield perfectly.  I am consistently leaving the car in 100%+ temps and while the car is still hot, the steering wheel can be held and the seats are comfortable.
B0040DX7EO|5|Awesome product, wondering why this isn't a default for all cars.
B00CB8WM2S|4|I hope no one in my family ever needs to use it but I think it will be fine in case they do.
B005DUME1U|2|Functioned well until a few weekends ago. Got crossed up because of another guy on the track and dumped the bike. Lever snapped completely off in the socket. Don't think there is a warranty either.
B00SA25KWI|5|Great value for the money!!perfect size!!!good product!!!!!
B010JRL2MS|5|They fit great and the style is far better than I expected. The design of the product is very different
B0049MRJ9U|5|Good product, easy to install, everything was finished in 40 minutes. I am not a mechanic and it was still simple installation.
B000COOLMC|4|Worked fine..
B000HBNWOI|5|This stuff is GREAT! Over the years I have never found anything that worked as well as this stuff, AND there is enough to do... oh probably be able to glue 30 or more mirrors to windshields. Mixes easily, is thick enough to stay where I put it and thin enough to squeeze out from under the metal \\"slug\\" that the mirror mounts to. After a total of 24 hours it is rock hard and the mirror \\"feels\\" like it is part of the windshield. It is better than the much more expensive glue \\"pad\\" that some packages provide. They stick, but because of the pad thing they are never really firmly stuck to the windshield, there is always a tiny bit of wiggle which IMO is why they fall off after a while. I am VERY happy with this stuff!!!
B0036VBS42|5|They have been on my mustang for about 6 months and look great still good buy
B00LMICSIQ|5|good product and as advertized
B00G0KRHK0|5|Awesome scent
B001EEXJUE|5|Perfect fit, on time delivery, no hassle installation, work as they should and give the vehicle a nice look.
B0007LZGXS|5|Coupler was everything I expected for my light duty trailer. Pretty good quality and great price
B00UCO4PTG|1|This product does not fit correctly. big gap on my two front windows, wind noise is horrible. I do not recommend purchasing this product.
B00VDHJLWW|1|Almost amazing as the design and the pockets are awesome, but the strings that hold it up are a joke.  The string broke on one side the very first time I hung it on the back of the seat.  There wasn't even anything in it, it was just from me snugging it down.  If it had proper straps that could actually support a load to keep it snug against the seat this would be amazing.  Unfortunately it is not.
B00X6WXFXI|4|I ordered two packs expecting to get 8 LED's considering it says 4 pcs. When they arrived there was only two LED strips. So I contacted the seller and he sent me 6 more LED's right away. No big deal, just human error. As for the LED's themselves they work well and look good on my bike. The only downside is the wire used is a very small gauge. It makes it difficult to work with. Still a good product for the price.
B00ANZHG7C|4|Run of the mill microfiber towels. I found them to lint a quite a bit even after washing. They're good for light duty cleaning, or for cleaning the door jams of cars because they're cheap enough to be sacrificial (especially with S&S on Amazon). They're an 80/20 polyester/polyamide blend and made in China. Remember to wash them only with microfibers, on warm, no softeners, no bleach, and dry on extra low or air. I'll buy more as needed of this product.
B004HL5SF0|5|Was suprised to see a sticker saying &#34;Made in China&#34;<br />Definitely USA quality upon inspection. Not yet tested though. I expect good results.
B004GDIKAE|5|Door opens a ok now.
B00JUWB6SO|5|Awesome, works exactly as you would want it too.
B00HS9PKJW|5|This. Is. Bad. Arse.
B00Z83VJC2|5|Awesome!! Works perfectly!!'
B008G2XOUM|1|has a crack in it
B0002ZGC0U|5|Just what I needed. Good real copper fine stranded wire
B0070Y363C|5|Great product, easy install and slim design for a nice professional look. The lights are bright enough to be seen during the day as running lights. Make sure to clean area very well with alcohol and dry thoroughly prior to installation or they will not stick.
B0002V2FEQ|2|This is the second of these I purchased. Both worked well at first. However with use they seem to fall apart. There is an issue with the ignition spark. With both units the case separates when pressing the trigger moving the wire that causes the spark. These are expensive for how long they last. I would look for a more robust tool.
B000S6RFRW|5|Love this light bar. Cobra makes quality products. Took about an hour to hook up to my 2011 vstar 1300 tourer
B000COXNXK|5|strong clip
B00KR5AEA4|1|Started the installation of a set of these lights this morning. After a few disappointments with online orders, everything is bench tested before installation. Tested on a 12 volt system, this kit does NOT do as advertised. There is no sequential signals. When the second light was tested, it started smoking and burned internally.
B00CSW5ISM|5|Very nice exhaust tips. I put them on my Jaguar and its just what it needed to stand out.
B00HS0H846|5|Great Quality, perfect fit for my 1997 Volvo 850 Wagon
B00TBHXC4E|4|Crazy to actually see a different formula for vinyl protector.  You have to put some work into this to get it to dry, almost like buffing something with wax.  I recommend you don't use it on your seats or steering wheel until you are comfortable with how dry you can get it.  Works well, though:  seems like putting in some work always means you get results.
B00ATTSKMC|3|Should have included o-rings for the filter .
B00BITHBOU|3|Looks and works great. Easy to install.
B00C6JUSHI|5|Looks great and the signal is the same. Not flexible like the oem antenna.
B00SX6ZSUK|5|Came quickly, attached easily, looks great, and so far all the bling is staying on my license plate frame even after car washings.
B000FOW4NW|5|Beautiful gauge works great
B007DCDJOW|5|Looked great on my car!!!!  Arrived on time.
B00CO8A9NY|5|great product, exceeded my expectations
B00GOYN3Y6|5|Installed on a 2010 Harley Ultra classic. Love it! Brighter and much cheaper than the Harley Daymaker which is the previous generation of this bulb.
B005JU5XYE|5|Great quality, good price.<br /><br />I checked different blades from other manufacturers to get the best bang for my buck.  I settled on the ICON after looking at other Bosch.  Very happy with the price/quality.<br /><br />Replacing the blades took about a minute for both.  Simple to do, if you've done it at least once before.  For a complete novice, still easily within your ability to swap blades.  When installed properly, it snaps shut and leaves no doubt you did it properly.
B00B1XFPFK|5|Love it, great size
B0009SO2AC|5|Good product and quick delivery.
B0026MCT72|5|Really smooth ride. Purchased to help stabilize the back of my Motorhome
B009XIOEB6|1|DANGER!!!  BEWARE!!!  DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK CRAP GASKET. THEY ARE VERY SOFT RUBBER, DO NOT FIT RIGHT AND LEAKS LIKE THE DEVIL. COST ME A SET OF REAR BRAKE PADS AND ALMOST AN ACCIDENT FROM OIL ON THE TIRE.
B000CO86BY|5|Great Jack stands.
B00K1VYGNA|5|I ordered a set of the Textured Black bars for my 2014 Chevy Silverado 1500 Double Cab.  I bought the cab length (not the extended length for the bed step).<br /><br />They arrived 2 days after I ordered which was well ahead of schedule.  It was a nice surprise to see them sitting on my steps on Friday, just in time for an early morning Saturday install.  Packaging was great, each bar was bubble wrapped.  It took me longer to open the box and unwrap the bars than it did for me to install them.  Out of the box they looked awesome and I was excited to get them on the truck.<br /><br />Installation:  My mechanical level is average, so I will admit I did a youtube search on the installation of these.  There were installation instructions in the box, but we all know those can be poorly written.  So, one three minute youtube video did the trick.  I got out my tools (a 13mm socket and a 13mm wrench) and put both bars up in about 15 minutes.  There are three clips that go into the cab body and then three other places (6 bolts total per side).  They popped in easily.  Tighten them up and it's good to go.  I had no issues with fitment or alignment.  The holes and bolts lined up very easy and I had no problem.  It was nice to get a job done quickly and with minimal cussing.<br /><br />Looks and Use:  They look fantastic.  That's all I can say..... My truck has a 7&#34; RCX Lift and 35&#34; tires on 20&#34; rims.... my 8 year old couldn't get in.  Now she has no issues climbing up into the truck.  To be honest, I was having trouble getting in and I'm 6' tall and in pretty good shape for my age.  These bars make all the difference.  The step is convenient and has great grip so no slipping (not sure yet about the rain or snow).<br /><br />Overall I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  Look, use, value all get an A+.
B0006IX87S|1|Bought this put it on rv it lasted for about two days then stopped working, not worth the money at all, interefered with water pressure when it stopped working waste of money
B00HRMSX6W|5|My husband put LED lights in his car and I liked it so much I had to order some too.  I love it the way it brightens up the car.
B00N7KMXLE|5|Very nice looking, I put them on my bike and the show up well
B003PB9QRO|5|Great service. A+++++ Fan works great...
B008S9CHW4|4|I'm a new motorcycle rider.  I just guessed on the size and bought a large, and it worked out for me.  Its a pretty solid helmet, the face shield is removable and I have ridden with this for a few hours now, with no complaints.  Good product for the money!
B0041PAIFC|5|great product
B003WDDLTO|5|Worked perfectly for my needs.  Highly recommend for the price
B004QI0FCK|5|Worked perfectly!!!
B0089K6GMO|5|Great key, works as it should. Since it's OEM, it doesn't have any issues that I've read some keys have (thickness is spot on!)
B008Y8JDTE|5|excellent product
B00BLTOTKQ|5|The wheel bearings are the closest to the GM manufacturer wheel bearings. The come complete and the ABS cord has all the right grommets in the correct place. They are significantly less money than ACDELCO Parts.
B000CJ8CZY|5|I installed a set of these plugs in my 2014 HD Iron 883, made a night and day difference in how the bike picks up from a twist of the throttle.  When I removed the stock plugs, they were way out of spec on the gap.  The NGK Iridium plugs came pre-gapped.  I noticed that the bike starts easier, seems to run cooler (less lean), and pulls through the RPM range easier after installing these plugs.<br /><br />I will be purchasing another set for when these need to be swapped out, definitely recommend to other Sportster riders.
B000EDOSN8|4|it is black and keeps the light out. allows air in even when it is raining, allows vent to be open when going down the highway
B000JL760C|5|If you go on track, you need SRF!
B007TN15EG|5|Created perfect double-flared ends on stainless line.  I broke a cheaper tool trying to double-flare and this one works like a champ.  My second Mastercool tool, both work great!
B000OR18BE|5|Makes dumping so much easier.
B00Q8SJDJC|5|Looks awesome and made it through a car wash.....It's exactly as described.... be very careful. Not much room for error. Definitely have a SHARP blade
B00RSOLXFM|5|Super nice people.  Everything was great.  Would buy again.
B00KJGPN2K|4|Works like a champ!  First thing to do is update the firmware. My only complaint is the speakers are very tinny, as in lots of treble, no bass. Other than that, I'd recommend the 20S over the 10's.
B00YGBNIPI|5|This item fit perfectly as a replacement for the outside case of the key fob for my 2007 Toyota Prius. This item saved me lots of money over getting a whole new fob.
B0031HEIDY|5|These are very good bulbs.  Very bright and I know the ones I replaced had “aged” but the added brightness was a big step up.  Glad I bought the two pack and just didn’t got to an auto parts store and buy one bulb when one went out.  Great benefit in replacing both.
B00OZ1FZZA|4|Fits the bike well, and sounds really good. The mounting strap is very, very difficult to get to conform to the Diamond shaped profile of the muffler.
B00AC6TYGI|5|Roland Sands does it again!  They riser plugs filled the unsightly holes that the factory risers left in the upper triple trees after the stock handlebars are removed (after installing clip-on handlebars).  The give the bike a better, more completed look... plus these match the RSD &#34;look&#34; that the rest of my bike has.  These are made from metal and are powdercoated, no cheap plastic parts here!
B00V3QWFUI|5|love it
B00KY41U42|5|Perfect fit
B000B8N3J6|2|Good cap. Broke when I needed to open it. Hard to turn with handle in the way. Changed my rating from 5 stars to 2 stars.
B008FCE7ZO|5|A+
B00R8MXTCE|5|Correct length with stock handlebars and carbs. They work well, arrived in good condition, and were an excellent price. I'd recommend them to anyone looking to put a new throttle cable on their 350.
B00FMV0WFA|1|Did not fit my 2015 hd!!!! Way to big!!!
B00JAMHTJO|4|Great if it fit my morRyde pin
B00C3AIOTY|5|Great Product
B000HZT89C|3|I like it and like the location but it tends to collapse when empty or partially full.  Still better than the system I had.
B0006FKFMC|2|Doesn't work
B00267PZUK|5|2007 Ford Expedition with 113,330 miles. 6 out of 8 plugs broke and this tool made removal simple.
B00VVF1PNY|5|Great product selection and great prices; delivery never a problem!
B002BHWWVA|5|IT S WHAT I SPECTED. GOOD!
B009SWFFUQ|5|Like the keychain and valve in great conditions
B001I9ATJE|4|My son loved it
B001XVKFSW|5|Just as described. Delivered earlier than quoted.
B0055A5AEG|5|This was a perfect replacement for my 1997 Chevrolet Silverado K1500 with the 5.7 liter engine.  Easy to install, I used RTV sealant between the new cover and the motor assembly.  Happy to have my wipers working again for a fraction of the cost on a new wiper motor.  Don't worry if you drop/lose one of the original cover screws, this comes with three new ones!
B000BGM240|5|Worked great
B00G6FFFDU|5|happy
B000M6Y1T8|5|Just what my two stroke needed.
B005OXF11Q|4|OK for the money. Beats the $75.00 Toyota wants at their parts department.
B000CO9186|5|Worked like a charm
B00QXTZ0QQ|4|It fits my Ford Ranger well.  And although it is thin and lightweight, it doesn't seem so thin that it'll tear just from wind gusts or normal use.  Also, I was worried about whether or not the material would trap moisture, for instance if it was left on the truck when it rained.  Trapped moisture can cause rust- this being my fear.  Well it hasn't rained yet but every morning there's a lot of dew where I live.  Thankfully the cover is porous enough that it allows the moisture to evaporate pretty quickly.  So all is well, at least after a couple weeks of use.
B00K6BJTUU|5|Love it just wished it came with wiring instructions
B00HZQ5DEA|5|Helped with energy,and drive.Solid product.
B00UY405MU|5|LOVE IT. Truck looks boss!
B0002FU44K|5|A1
B009J7PAUU|4|I installed this on the front wheel of my DRZ400S, made the tire install slightly more difficult as expected. I don't really know if it will work until I get a flat.
B00ABYVT64|5|Sturdy bottles with &#34;to the bottom&#34; sprayers.
B005DUUK2U|1|Zipper is very cheap broke right away  very poor quality
B00VNJ4N46|2|This was supposed to fit my 2010 Mini and the hardware that came with the is did not fit. I had to search several hardware stores to find the proper hardware :-(
B00HWGD2CS|3|A nice looking unit that worked to a point. We had no luck getting the Nissan Leaf's automatic timer to charge overnight. Plugging in directly and hitting charge was a breeze, but there were compatibility issues with our 2012 model electric. Called the company to inquire, we were told the matter would be taken to the president of the company directly, but we waited a week for a return call that never came. If you're hoping to use that feature with that car, it seems, you're out of luck -- if not, a great value.
B00A18EYI0|5|Same exact product that I got from Napa for a fraction of the price. Worked great on 2002 dodge Dakota.
B005RF6G4M|5|Sunshade works great and fits windshield perfectly!
B00O3GYZUI|5|They work great!
B00KHTAI7E|4|It was easier to program than I expected.  All controls work perfectly.
B005O96YM0|5|Great break rotors
B001U8MPMM|5|Good product..love it
B000IY4AKE|5|Works great. No regrets.
B001JT37VK|5|They work great
B00WID0OEE|5|This is a great product.  We had an old metal one which didn't work. This is much lighter and cleans our shower really nicely.
B000IG7PMM|5|Item arrived in quick fashion.  Used this to replace rear end fluid in my Dodge Ram after putting a new rear end gear cover.
B00DBCML8S|5|As described, fit was right and worked great.
B00AQUVCQA|5|Excellent reproduction, made in Japan just like the original.
B00KMGQ3OE|5|GREAT EMBLEM, EASY TO INSTALL, THE CAR STANDS OUT MORE
B00SSMOS5U|5|Fits great and works as advertised.  I would buy another.
B004C24L5M|1|very cheap tool ,you have to check one by one to see with one fits
B007KPU1CU|5|Great! Keeps our drinks cold!
B00AL1KK9Y|2|Not great. I bought this tent for ease of use since we would be camping in a different spot every night for eight days. It was anything but easy. Even though the dimensions look like they can fit a queen blow up mattress, they can't, don't try. The &#34;vent window&#34; really does nothing. Every morning we woke up and condensation was just dripping from the ceiling, even with the windows and door open. There's nowhere to hang a tent fan. I almost had a nervous breakdown every morning trying to fold it back up. Even after 6 days it was difficult. I say six because we slept in our van two of the nights because I just couldn't stand to look at the thing. Where are the directions on how to attach the guide lines?? We just winged it, it kind of worked. Missing a stake. I would recommend this if your kids want a hangout in the backyard. Not for actual camping.
B00GJ1DP06|5|Easy to install  !!!!
B000CJD47A|5|it has been working thus far and it seems to serve the purpose.
B003NVEXUQ|5|These are 1.6 ratio as it states in the lower description. These work great and are quiet. They have withstood 7000 rpm and 0.600 inches of lift so far.
B000BZG8YG|5|it works Perfect!
B000CMHVBC|4|Saves me scraping but not high enough to completely cover windshield.  Had to buy 2 for front.  Bought extras in case for gifts and used a 3rd for my rear window.<br /><br />Wish this product would properly fit SUVs - product description says it does, but I had to double up.  My friends have a full size SUV and it absolutely did not cover their windshield completely.<br /><br />Easy to use, but not convenient for one person to put it on by one self.
B000E24APU|1|crap
B00PPT1MGC|5|Nice
B00L2PJA9E|5|Relatively easy to install; could have used a deep draft socket which the instructions did not specify. It looks great and does the job for my handicapped wife.
B00IK4CWJA|5|Great vendor. I had an issue with the first set, I did not lift. Exchanged with no problem. Went thru a few emails to pin point which one's were the one's that fit. Quick turn around and they fit. Definitely recommend vendor to others.
B001UCIKEK|5|Purchased these as well as some Dura Rear Disc Rotors.  Fit perfectly on my 2006 VW Beetle.  Have not noticed any noise/squeaking.
B000C1MW6C|5|Installed these pads on a C6 Corvette. I replaced the factory installed semi-metallic pads that had 12000 miles on them. The braking power was the  same as the stock pads, but the low speed squeal was completely eliminated. They also gave the pedal a much better feel under all braking conditions. Pedal feedback is much smoother. They also have eliminated 90 percent of the brake dust on the wheels. These pads did exactly what I hoped they would do.
B006EGAIII|4|Did what I needed
B000Q8PDKI|5|Exactly as described.  Very pleased with transaction.  Thank you.
B007OSL3DY|5|worked very well.  nothing cheap about this product other than the price.
B00P9R417M|4|Great room. No mount instructions. Latch hard to close due to box top not aligning.  Looks good.
B00G2QQIXY|5|It worked right away...
B00EJWYMRW|5|Love this verse.  Awesome! Good quality.  Well made.  Thank you.  Fit perfect on the trunk of my car, if any bigger, it would not have fit.  Thank you once again.
B00XRJZH8G|5|love it
B007ZDNC6Y|5|Amazing
B00A3FMFNC|4|nice after market bags.  would purchase again.
B005HKWGBO|5|Good quality
B00UW0HFXS|4|Soon after submitting my order, Karl sent me an email asking me for specific details about my trailer.  I sent him the information and he told me the model number (SL-2M) I needed for my trailer.  It is a heavy duty coupler lock.  I just have one minor complaint.  It is hard to lock and unlock the padlock since it is a tight fit.  Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars.
B000M1F32M|5|Just what I was looking for, perfect and great price!
B00EUIDPLO|5|This met the Ohio guidelines that our county sticker must show!!
B003XU6ADU|5|Good gloves. Great fit & comfortable.
B00PMK7F1U|4|Good replacement for my 2500HD 6.0 Vortec (2005). Be careful, the gap on the plugs vary wildly between plug and you should get feeler gauges to double check the gap on each plug before installing them (hence the 4 stars only).
B006FUT0CS|4|very good 😎
B00BCRMC1U|5|Amazing product. I was missing a few pieces but they were shipped to me right away
B0095D34YM|2|Ir has not marked negativo and positive
B00112UU24|5|Product arrived as described  I love this stuff it really does a great job on most every surface except cloth or painted surfaces.
B000C57W90|5|Great products. Fit perfectly. Love the ability to lube the new joints.
B00EJ6KUYC|5|Got it today, look very good!!
B0053OIMK8|5|Nice
B000CFSJCY|5|happy w/purchase
B00R3Q1NZU|5|Exact fit
B0068FYMVO|4|All the parts are there and it works ok.  The clamp for the handlebar on my bike is difficult to install, because of the direction of the screws. Every bike will be different.
B000CNHEJ0|4|Nice mellow tone, still a great sound.
B00H8DFKS4|5|Awesome lights, easy install...had to slightly bend in the tubular light contacts to better hold the lights but no big deal I love them!<br />2014 XLT F150
B00JR4D9T4|5|This refill gives you an additional trizact disc than the system comes with, and plenty of sandpaper refills. My only complaint is that I wish this came with another of the foam pads for applying the polishing compound.
B00HY3COJG|5|just the trick to smooth out mud terrain tires, was enough for 4 265/75r16
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Awesome fast shipping great lights
B0009JB7GI|5|worked good
B000FFGO4Q|4|nice hose made it work on my 66 impala, threads were different on one end but it could have been my car's rear end had been changed. I used a different brass &#34;T&#34; at the rear end..
B001TH6ET4|5|I love these saddle bags.<br />They fit my bike just great without supports. I have 2011 suzuki boulevard.
B00ML0EHS8|4|These are pretty much stock replacement bulbs as far as brightness, but should so much longer I would suggest buying them unless you want something with more light output than stock.
B00C8YXH9C|4|Neat things, they were plenty bright doing some tests. Stuck them in my truck in case of an emergency, hope I never have to use them!  4* because one of the 3 had a stripped screw. Had a heck of a time getting it open to pull the battery tab
B00S8ET1A0|5|Great product. Fit like factory! No regrets what so ever.
B00N58KRXO|5|Programs easy. Have one for me and one for my wife. Each programs separately by pushing button on back of lock and pressing lock button on remote. To begin with - I didn't think it worked unless I was very close to lock. However, I found that it is NOT like a garage opener that where it is activated immediately. In order to lock or unlock you have to press the buttons for 1-2 seconds. That is nice because it almost eliminates &#34;pocket presses&#34;. Makes it convenient.
B003UVGUDC|1|Do not buy. Only had this item a few months and Chevy emblem already discolored.
B00CL4551M|2|I like the plate but one of my packages was missing the screws and caps.... Kind of took away the security feature.
B0021KZFCA|4|Buffs ok but spreads a lot lint.
B00VXRT636|5|Great product..
B004A32ONY|5|Worked awesome!
B00GKLOPYU|5|Fabulous little device. A lot easier than hiking up the pants so you can lift your foot a foot.
B00R1FIWXY|1|Starter did not fit my truck after being listed on here as compatible. Had to cut and trim the housing on the one bolt. Also had to buy a new bolt to get it to clear. Starter works fine but clearances were not right. It was built out of spec. What should have been a 20min job turned into an all day PITA. However shipping was extremely fast. One star is for fitting and frustration as being listed as compatible. Quality of product seems good. Just wrong information.
B001PNO368|5|Very good switch.
B004SJY97Y|5|bought this for my son to keep in his car
B00JMOUYM4|1|Frame does not hold license plate correctly.  Needs two bottom holes or tabs to hold. Otherwise, it causes major rattling.  In addition, the received item was scratched on upper left corner.
B000C2GFHS|4|works well for what i wanted to do, nice and well made.
B0035U1KPG|5|Noticeable difference over stock pads on a 2008 Royal Star Tour Deluxe. Seem to leave less brake dust also. No squeeling is a plus.
B00G620ZVU|5|There are  bright
B010GCEYGW|4|Good quality.
B007NGB5VW|3|Run very small in the thighs which makes them hard to wear...  Might return
B001BNSSGI|5|Great fit.  Easy to install.
B00D47A68C|5|Fits my 07' Highlander like a glove.  Happy camper.
B00RM26LXO|5|works as designed. Was a direct replacement for the stock flasher relay in my 2013 Triumph Bonneville.
B00A8O7UEW|4|This product worked just as it said it would.  1 can covers quite a large area.  I used it on a vehicle frame and an antique iron gate before I painted both.  So far so good!!!
B00KS4ZU4E|1|i ordered these and they dont fir my 2000 gmc jimmy another set that said it did but dosent.
B000RJS2FE|5|Love this license plate!<br />Every TAZ fan needs one!!!<br />Not many left...
B00OIOY0QY|5|Clipped right in and worked just fine.
B00M1Y37VM|5|Chevron Texaxo make great lubricants and always have
B00F2OGZAI|5|Perfect replacement for my Son's Car.
B00JEK5XBS|5|you'll never go back to regular running boards or nerf bars again !
B003LNJWTI|3|Look good but low visibility
B00844UB62|4|Its a good overall chock,you can get better but certainly get lessor quality as well. I'm a little concerned about disconnect having 4 thumb screws at three eights diameter.But used for a short travel once and done fine...Overall please so far !
B005ZKLFRM|5|Mats are outstanding!
B00CAKILAO|4|Good material.
B005D4AHSS|5|great buy.  I get this kits to install on my customer's cars and they are the best.  I have installed $200-300 kits and to be honest I cant tell the difference between those expensive kits and kensun kits.
B004R305QU|5|We put it on easily enough. But then we went camping and was very pleased how much difference there was!! My husband said it was well worth the price and time to install it. So thank you.  And delivery was very quick as well..
B00H554R98|5|Great Price and fast shipping
B005FNKSMW|1|Unfortunately this did not work with what I bought it for and because it was a battery I could not sent it back.
B00652G4TS|5|Excellent so far.  It retrieves codes and clear codes.
B005JU5TUM|5|They cost more but really do last a lot longer than any other wiper blade I have ever had. Love them!
B004LPAP2I|5|This is a really good product.  I used it on headlights that were foggy, they turned out great.  Same results on minor scratches on painted products.
B000BR3BF8|5|Love it!  Better gas mileage and my engine runs so much better now.
B004RU90E6|5|COOL
B001CIWGHO|5|Its what i needed and it fit, a problem with the Bass Pro knock off.
B00MW7VWZ6|3|these arrived fast and look beautiful but one of them was defected and company only guarantees for 90 days
B00533Y5FA|5|Durable and easy to put on. Looks great and doesn't fade
B002R0ASEE|4|Just right
B007BKEVBG|5|Quick service, correct mirror
B00A740VQM|2|It was to small
B007QBR248|5|Bought this thinking its what i needed and later on resulted in being the power steering pump but still was brand new and worked perfectly
B011UG9GW0|2|I didn't find anything in the R 134 system that would connect to these adapters
B0024E6QX0|5|Works great!
B00YXBEE36|5|What i need and it came in the nick of time!  Wow, just glad Amazon carried this specific part.  Far cheaper than the competitive parts on the site and it fit without issue and mechanic checked the part and approved of it's performance.  No more sweating in the hot summer heat!
B00JIEX722|5|I have several VW's and Audi's that monitor all the onboard lights and alert you if one is out. This can be a problem with some LED lights. I can say I have never had a problem related to the JDM ASTAR LED lamps. I have purchased dozens of these bulbs for my cars and will continue to do so. They give a very white, clean, color that is a huge improvement over the &#34;yellow&#34; color from the original OEM bulbs. I am impressed with the range of bulbs available since some auto bulbs can be a little strange.
B0013UEYL2|5|I usually buy these locally, but Amazon had a really low price, and free shipping with Prime. This is a muffler that's hard to beat. Not real quiet, but it's not supposed to be. If you want something a little quieter, get a Hush Thrush.
B000CIT3N0|5|Fit as expected. Good
B00U9RXUTM|5|Absolutely necessary product.  Easy to install.  Perfect.  Thank you!
B0031G8W9Q|5|Exactly what we looking for....
B00DSOUG5E|5|Fantastic!  I listen to music everyday on my way to work, answer phone calls, and best of all speak with friends who also have the Sena on long rides.  Does what its supposed to do.
B0011KZNW8|5|Fits like a glove works with the trailer perfectly
B007NLOZAU|5|The recommended coolant for the line of Subaru engines.  I guess I could have poured any 50:50 mix in, but why chance it when you can get OEM coolant for a reasonable price.
B00N9LMXUC|5|Great price, came free shipping............
B0009TS9QE|5|shipped fast, product was as described.
B001C3MFFC|5|Love these throw over universal bags. You will prob need saddlebag brackets to install properly
B0009JKGJW|5|as advertised
B00E8CV0EQ|5|This is a great product from a great company! They have amazing customer service, and I could not be happier with the item itself. I bought 1 pack of 2 for each of my parent's cars for emergencies, and I will be buying more for my other loved ones. I will be recommending this product to others in the future.<br /><br />The hammer is small enough to fit compactly in a glove compartment, but has great grip and feels heavy enough to smash open a window from the inside. It really offers a sense of security to know that there's one of these less than a foot away from the driver's seat.<br /><br />5/5 stars for me.
B006VFEJJQ|5|Worked great & good price
B00OZQ170M|4|Product installed easily, fit perfectly, and arrived as promised. Package arrived in good shape, however it seemed as though the edges of stainless steel were not all cut neat & crisp, and had some minor blemishes, almost if they had been setting on the work bench for an extended period of time, or they went through some rough handling before they got shipped. Over all they look good on our Murano, and really dressed it up nicely.
B00TV2GCFK|5|Works great.
B000P0TZZG|5|Worked superbly .... He was thrilled to get the bolt out ... Thanks for offering.
B00OZGKVN6|5|Everything is fine thanks
B007XUHPVM|5|Worked great...for an even greater price...I saved a bundle...thanks Amazon!
B00ONHAH7W|5|It arrived perfectly & fit perfectly!
B00CENJ980|5|Great quality. Love this. Looks great  on our vehicle.
B006B2AGPU|5|Performs as advertised.
B0088GZYPY|5|Just love these headlights, brings out the look of the car so much.
B0015CGT70|5|Good quality part!
B00MJ4812Y|4|instructions are the worst making it hard to understand which way is front and back.  Extra bracket not explained and when called company couldn't get a straight answer.
B0002U2V1Y|5|Worked great, i have a new car but it had some texture in the paint from being on the lot, this removed all of it and made it extremely smooth.
B008Q0EHB4|5|Best cleaner for acrylic, we use a lot at the museum. Handy spritz bottles are easy for the maintenance people to carry.
B0036UI1OI|4|A nice heavy duty camping chair that should last for years. It's not one of those small, compact chairs you often see. Perfect for an RV or trailer.
B00B9Z86GU|4|1 star off for the $26 price, however, it is the real thing and a quality product.<br />It does not come with retaining washers and you may want to use glue to make sure the posts do not separate from the washers.
B007ZGCQ4K|1|NOT FOR THE 6 SPEED MANUAL, TWO WHEEL DRIVE!! says NOWHERE on the product or the manufacturers page anywhere about whether this can be used for the manual transmission model of the Juke. IT CAN NOT. I discovered this issue only when it came time to install. Should have checked the piping first before dropping the old set out. Would have saved time and money. Consider me pissed off for the lack of information. Thanks Injen. . .for not a damn thing =_=<br /><br />Let me be clear. Injen makes an incredible product. I do not fault the product. I am however extremely dissatisfied with the poor marketing and information of their products. It's 2015 guys, get it together. If there is a difference in models or trim then you need to make damn sure the buyer knows what they are buying. Waste. . .of. . .time. . .and. . .money. . .
B008ESJFYM|5|it is good for dodge caravan 2014
B004IARKRY|1|1 complete light bar works when it wants too
B00Z7KIZPA|1|The ad is deceiving.  I sent back.  My small purse did not fit, the bottom is not as wide as the top.<br />You could put your clutch, wallet or ipad in there though.
B0049HKFIM|5|Works great. fit like expected
B004NEM6EC|5|it fit just like they said it would !!
B000C8T9MA|4|Seemed to do a good job in helping with airflow and helped with moisture accumulating on windows.  They had been fogging up a little and required the AC to be in to clear it.  Now I don't need the AC.
B010H0QV7S|4|DBPOWER 5-in-1 Digital Tire Pressure Gauge With Multi Emergency Tool-Window Breaker, Seatbelt Cutter and Flashlight for Automotive is a great tool to keep handy. I primarily uses this for the digital tire pressure gauge which took me a few tries to get it to work (as it is not exactly the same feel as using manual tire pressure). The digital read is accurate (compared to my manual tire pressure gauge). I haven't tried the seat belt cutter on a real seat belt (I test it on paper and it cuts the paper just fine). I also haven't tested the hammer (as I don't have any glass that I want to break right now). I do notice that sometime it's a bit hard to flip open the hammer/window breaker tool, as I often have to press the button twice and also help the hammer to flip open with my finger a bit (by pushing it down). The flashlights isn't the brightest that I have seen but it's good enough to use to navigate around the car during night time (to check your tire or inside the car or under the hood). The main body of this product is made from plastic but seems good enough to complete the tasks (I haven't tested the window breaker function however). Thanks DBPOWER for sending me this sample product.
B00CH6T18C|5|Works well on our furniture. Makes it feel softer without being oily or greasy. I will be buying this again.
B00ECTRBHA|5|A friend of mine has these paw print stickers and I liked them so much that I got a set.  I'm buying a second set for a friend of mine.  They are really great!
B00G6KMPBK|1|This shank uses the same Part Number as the Reese shank and is identical to the Reese shank. .The Reese unit looked stronger either cast or forged, and was made in USA..  This unit is clearly stamped, MADE IN CHINA.  I'm not a professional, but it seems to be welded and then ground sort of smooth. It fit very loosely in the receiver.  I called Reese they explained that Pro Series is another company owned by the same parent company.  That it was in reality a &#34;Reese&#34; part.<br />When I looked at my old Reese unit (similar but a little different, which is why I needed a longer shank) it just looked so well made compared to  this unit.  I thought it was a Chinese &#34;Knock Off&#34;......and because it didn't fit tightly (wobbled side to side), I returned it.<br />I have to assume, that to keep profit margins higher, Reese out sourced this part to CHINA.  All very sad,  USA quality, replaced by cheap Made in China.  Imagine, towing my 9,000 trailer, with my F350 and this thing snaps in half..................that's what I feared.
B00VL77U8G|5|Solves the problem, most obd scan tool cables protrude into the drivers footwell. This adaptor gives me room to drive,while recording drivability data.
B00LTL0VX0|3|Working so far.
B00BUS5BGO|5|This fit well my 2015 Subaru Forester.  It works great for keeping the content out of sight.  Much better price then the dealer could give me.
B001GJZ0WW|5|This is a great fit for our B&W 18k Companion hitch.  It's well made and easy to use.  We definitely recommend it.
B001B7RS4M|5|Just as described.  Super easy installation.  I've had for a couple months now and love it.
B00FQ79G8O|5|Shoe's showed up early, they look good, feel good, and you can see that they are put together well.  As far as size, use a pair of Chuck Taylor All Stars as a go by.  I did that and the shoes fit perfect, with just enough extra room for a pair of thick socks as needed.  As others have said previously, the shoes don't breath!  I tried them on with a pair of regular white socks.  By the time I took them off, I could tell my feet were sweating.  I'll buy a pair of thin oder eaters to help on long rides for the rest of summer.  These shoes look good with a pair of jeans, they really give off that Euro race look, not the death robot jump boot look.  I haven't had a chance to use them on a ride, but that will happen tomorrow.  I'll at least take a walk in them tonight to began some kind of break in.  So far I'm glad I chose these over several other brands and types.
B004RFKBEO|2|Although sturdy and does the job, the carrier was difficult to assemble and to keep both sides of the deck level and balanced.  We also hit bottom on parking lot/driveway entrances and exits perhaps in good part due to the low clearance of our hitch.  A coupler/adaptor from the hitch to the carrier that will allow the platform to be raised would be a huge help.  If this could be offered by the manufacturer, we would be much more satisfied and probably raise our ranking to 4 stars.  The fact that we weren't warned of this potential problem is a major negative.  Also, the unit was advertised as universal but it wasn't.  We had to buy an adaptor to fit our smaller hitch size.
B007USR4C2|5|This met all of our expectations.
B001I9XP68|5|I bought these for my 84 FLT...I am trying to go for an old school look and these pull off the look nicely, and they are far brighter than I thought they would be. They stand out in a crowd.
B00GSAUHB8|5|SO I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND  BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN LIKE A 100 DEGREES OUT AND THE INSIDE OF HIS CAR IS LIKE A BOILING SAUNA ... WHEN HE FINALLY  RECEIVED  IT TO HIS SURPRISE  HE LOVED IT FITS RITE IN HIS WINDOW THANK
B000P4TTQ2|5|Items fit my 1991 Porsche 911 964 perfectly. Would definitely purchase again!
B000EDQQD8|4|Arrived as promised, works great, good quality
B000EDUTOA|5|Great level, easy to use
B00CKRJLWO|5|Great seat covers! They look good and were easy to install!
B00XZ9PHYM|1|A locksmith, nor the dealer(I work at a bmw dealership) can program this key!
B00CZ4VFIA|1|Total waste of money. Had problems since day one. Customer service replaced one unit but still continued to have problems. Emailed back and forth but they waited till after the 30 day mark on returns to completely ignore us. Emailed a few times. Asked to speak to a supervisor and they will not get back to us. Called 4 or 5 times and still no response. Terrible company with a terrible product.<br /><br />Units cut out during music or if we use intercom. Sometimes after using intercom, they just shut off and you can't turn them back on. Both units have current firmware and still do not work. Tried them with different music apps and different phones and still do not work. Have not worked since day one. I bought expensive paperweights. If we don't here back from UCLEAR we are reporting to the BBB due to the cut off of support during the one year warranty period and the delay in help to PURPOSELY make us miss the 30 day return. DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY
B008G442VA|5|fits and works.
B007KPWMU4|1|I bought this as it said &#34;Fits H-D tanks thru 1974 and custom gas tanks with internal (female) 3/8&#34; NPT connection.&#34; because i had bought and installed this &#34;Pingel Petcock Bung - 3/8in. NPT - Steel 38S&#34; on my gas tank. This Petcock had a different thread i'm assuming and got lodged on less than half way and when I attempted to back it out and remove it the lower half snapped completely free from the threaded portion leaving it in the bung. I had to drill and grind it out and re-tap the bung. waste of time and money.
B00AFBXQNC|4|My husband bought this to go with the MTM Hydro Professional - he used both to wash the cars over the weekend and says they work quite well.  The soap cleans without having to scrub and saved him a lot of time.  We plan on using these to clean all of our PVC window blinds next. Satisfied with the purchase.
B007SAIFWA|5|GREAT QUALITY
B00CEKUO1O|5|easy to use.
B010VUZL0M|3|Item is good but I cannot stand really bad smell...
B000CQ4DEQ|5|Accurately described with prompt shipment.
B00VUKGB2U|5|These LEDs are great. I put these in my custom 98 Saturn SL2. I recently had the car custom painted citrus peel and thought I would redo all the interior lighting with green LEDs to match. A simple start would be to change the dome light, which is what I used these for. They are surprisingly bright, especially at night. When I unlock the door and the lights come on, I can see this light through my dark tinted windows (and it looks really cool to bystanders!). They have really nice visibility and look then times better than the stock dome light. I have one picture of them inside, but the picture doesn't do it justice. These LEDs really fantastic in person.<br /><br />Also two lights are included, which is nice if one breaks or burns out. I'm not sure about my model but I maybe able to change the trunk light as well with the second one, I haven't got around to that yet. Both lights were also nicely shipped in an antistatic bag to prevent static discharge damage to the LED units.<br /><br />Definitely a nice little upgrade for any car that can make any older car more modern. Just be weary with driving around with unconventional colors in your car, I only have these come on when I am getting in and out of the car, I wouldn't drive around with any visible green LEDs on!
B00AO9Y4KE|5|looks good
B000C8T7X6|5|Works great
B001O07VI4|5|Nice replacement for the original key I had.
B00KQZY794|3|I had to actually drill holes on the side of this thing so that the side that has the handle would not slide up against the tire as it wouldn't spread the tire at all.
B004NUZ50I|5|They fit  perfect  on my bmw e36 m3. If you don't want spent double,This what you looking for. Here the one come from  eBay just half price.
B004GCPHDI|5|It's has a good quality
B00404WDUC|4|It's a nice gauge.
B00RE6KV48|5|Tried soon after I got it. It leaves a very nice finish without excessive slipperiness. A little goes along way!
B00J16PXMY|1|Purchased this for my new 2015 Ram 1500 Crew Cab end of June, received beginning of July just in time for my 4800 mile drive to Alaska.  I bought this to protect my seats from my two black labs during the trip.<br /><br />As of today, 16 August, I am not entirely pleased with this item.  Below is why:<br />-There seem to be several design flaws.  While the seat covers fit decently, they could be a bit more snug in certain areas, but it's not a huge deal because the fabric is not meant to be stretched.<br />-The strap system to keep the seat covers in place could use another look.  For the back portion of the covers, at the top (near headrests) there is velcro to keep it in place with the &#34;hairy&#34; fabric behind the seats, while on the bottom, the clip straps connect to the bottom part of the cover (I hope this makes sense).  When you fold the seats up, it shifts the cover in awkward positions requiring re positioning.  Would be a lot more efficient to keep the separate covers (top and bottom) completely separate.  Drop the clip straps from behind the seat instead of using velcro.<br />-The headrest holes are cheap.  No sewing to keep the material from fraying.  Would be a lot better of the holes were for the plastic headrest button things (whatever you call them) instead of just the 1/2&#34; or so holes for the metal rails to slide into.  Either way, the material frays and doesn't look great.<br />-The actual headrest covers are the loosest fit of them all.  The measurements need a closer look.<br />-The middle seat belt has no way of going through without taking the seatbelt mount off completely from what I've seen.  Only a big deal if you use the middle seatbelt.<br />-The worst part which is forcing me to do a return: I already have fraying in some of the seams where it appears that the stitching was not strong enough.  It isn't the material that is weak, that stuff seems really durable and thick, but the stitching in certain spots is just not holding.  Notacceptable for the money paid for these covers.<br />Some of these items I can look past, but the stitching is forcing an exchange.  I don't mind giving the cover another shot since the material itself is really durable, but these covers were installed for a short amount of time for my 4800 mile drive while having a cheap sheet to cover my seat cover (to trap all the dog hair).  To have these issues already, I don't have high hopes.
B002W0ZVRI|5|Nice shine
B00EIGLURO|5|Great by the case price!

B00UCNCSJ6|5|Since buying the Gooloo jump starter i have jumped dead batteries on 2 cars. One where the battety would not charge from a regular charger. Ihave since bought 3 more. One for each of my children. One uses it to charge her phone.
B005AT07HM|3|Took so long to get I sold the truck before it ever got installed. Forgot I even bought it
B00L5TES30|5|Love these!!
B00K7938O4|5|I was able to fit my license plate and frame under this. Wish I hadn't cracked some of if due to tightening too much though. Other than that perfect lol.
B003FBV8ZW|1|Do not buy really bad
B002DOME1E|5|Great additional purchase, all purpose tie downs
B00IS6RIR6|2|fell off
B00153CXFQ|5|Hope it works
B00I7KDXAY|5|Works great on HJC large open face helmet.  Much faster than threading the strap thru the D rings and you can still attach the end of the strap to the small round clip.
B00EHYN5E8|4|Fast Delivery. Exactly as advertised.
B007XOHKG8|5|Awesome
B009DJYTQU|5|as described.
B000CIV25M|5|Item exactly as described.  Perfect fit to replace the old expansion plug in my truck engine.
B002IV4KUA|5|It is a fuse holder!  Worked fine and is waterproof...
B00563C6XK|5|These look awesome on my Jeep Wrangler Sahara 2015, fit perfectly, easy to install, no drilling (which is a plus).  They definitely make the front of my Jeep look awesome as well as functional.  I didn't like that the radiator was so exposed and this fixes the problem as well as completing.
B0089GB90C|5|I ride in South Texas. Where it's hot hot. I ride with a full armor jacket in 110 degrees and couldn't do it without these Heat-out base layers. They are amazing. The second you start to sweat they activate, soaking up the least bit of moisture and then they amplify any air movement through vents. It's like wearing air conditioning.
B00D7HN0LE|5|GREAT PRODUCT! Received it in the mail today and figured out how and were to connect it and it worked perfectly! Took me about 5-6 mins to connect the piece that includes jacking the car, unplugging the original plug and connecting the new plug. The only problem I had with my Camaro was that my foglights did not come on at night time but now that problem is solved, I recommend this product to anyone!!!!
B00B2YHFO2|3|They look great... But mine stay dimmly lit on my 07 Ram.
B005JU5V6E|5|Seriously. Just buy these. I normally don't get excited about car parts. I have never written a review about a car part until now. These wiper blades are easy to install and work way better than any blade I've ever had on any vehicle.
B00R8GJOS8|4|Good product!
B00D3298A0|5|great price!
B004RNSLYS|5|I have been a Kendall preacher since I've known how to drive, no I won't beg you to buy this oil, but its one of the best on the market. I use this and the SAE 30 (for a much older vheicle) my 2001 S-10 2.2L Chevrolet has had Kendall since new and has 116,2XX miles and my 1963 Plymouth Savoy 3.7L (purchased used in 1968 with 52,000 miles) has been a daily driver since I bought it and always is for road trips... 47 years later the car has 280,3XX miles and the engine runs like new on SAE 30. No rebuilds, nothing but good 'ol preventative maintenance! Like their motto states &#34;Long Live The Engine&#34; I buy my Kendall at a local store for $2.79/quart which is almost half of Pennzoil & Valvoline and over half the cost less of Mobil 1. Give it a try, you won't regret it.
B000VHS7PW|5|I believe that they are the best, can't prove it, but at the least the sticker on the air cleaner prevents my local car dealer from swapping out the air cleaner on every scheduled maintenance visit whether it needs it or not. That alone is worth the extra expense! Installed Cold Air Intake on the Challenger and the Viper, and both have noticeable sound and performance improvements. Could not tell on the Lexus and the Jeep.
B0067UFEY4|5|Works well. What more can you say
B0066SZ6H2|5|Quick and easy.  I removed the little antenna nub and just have the silver base that I plugged with a little silicone, or chewing gum, or what have you.
B00KTJ9I46|5|Excellent.
B001KRYIC8|1|Broke when it arrives...
B000A8J97C|5|My boyfriend bought these for his truck and loves them.  They are good quality, low profile, and were super easy to install.  Great buy!
B004RFKBEO|5|This carrier is worth the purchase.  Carried 8 bowling balls (over 140 lbs) from Reno, NV to El Paso, TX and survived a monsoon and the heat.  Also carried two bikes and still had space for two extra bikes on a different trip.
B00G24AGDY|2|Cheap
B003ZIXKMO|5|looks and fits great
B005I60VZK|5|worked great
B002TMLJL6|4|Saved my carpet man of times, however it will slip on you if you have to jump into the truck, I've almost broke a couple bones a few times in a rush to get moving, pretty damn slippery. More of a plastic than a rubber, no grip.
B00VGREDUY|5|Great product. Easy install and sounds 100% than my stock horn.
B00NCZDJ44|5|Put one badge on my car and one on my phone case. Both stick well and look really nice. I would definitely recommend this product to any BMW owner
B0021UBSYO|4|This is my 3rd. Super bounce lite they last me about 1 Year i wish I could get an led lite but they don't make em any more ase master tech
B00029J3MA|3|Not enough rumble for my 2015 5.3 L Silverado.
B001AVVY7G|5|no problem-thank you!
B00WFZO5J0|4|Just received seems to be good quality haven't installed yet will let you know if unsatisfied
B009EVP4ZW|1|2011 2dr not compatible in any way. Had to return it and spent a fortune sending it back.
B001G75SLM|5|Very good
B00BZSE20U|5|No complaints, fits well, slight lip around the edge keeps dirt in without being a hindrance.  Textured material isn't the easiest to clean then again what similar material would be easy to clean?
B0002U2V1Y|5|Used this kit to clay bar my 2011 Silverado, and it just works and works well. The clay is a little less abrasive than the Megs kit I used prior to buying this kit. But it works very well if there is not a lot of surface contaminants.
B000EBKG9A|5|Work nights keeps sunlight out of bedroom easy and quick fix cheaper than blackout curtains.
B0031HJ2D0|4|this is what you need on top of the radiator of a NIssan frontier, xterra, pathfinde. Not the one with the pressure coil.
B00BG07QZA|5|So far so great.<br /><br />Sounds good, quality seems good, very good price, rear bolt is wrong (2015 KLR 650) simple enough though.
B00ER5K6QW|5|works good so far
B004BUUQ8G|2|Came fast.. not great instructions. .. had a dent in it  already. ... not a happy lady
B0012H6HMK|5|Darling
B001COAX78|5|Installed on a 1991 Subaru Loyale.  Car now starts first time every time.  I am  not an electrical person so it took me a few times reading the instructions and looking at the wiring diagram but once I figured it out it only took about 30 minutes to install.  Highly recommend this kit if you have found out about it through having starting problems then you are on the right track.
B004OK77L2|4|Very easy to install it, took very little time. Works great on our 25' toy hauler. Sure makes it much easier on my messed up back, I used to dread hooking up but not any more.
B00NBSHP2Y|4|Though I had seen riders use blue tooth headsets, I had never seen something as sleek as this.  One of my fellow riders has this on his helment and I bought it based on his recommendation. This is my 1st blue tooth headset. So I dont have anything else to compare to. However, here are my impressions after a month of use.<br /><br />I used it on a HJC FG 17 helmet Size large<br /><br />Pros: : the volume control unit attached outside the helmet is barely visible!!  Easy installation and decent performance. Blue tooth paring is quick and perfect every time its used.  I use ear plugs when riding. So I really cannot comment on the audio quality. But I do listen to music and it sounds just fine -  loud and clear. I can take phone calls which I find very convenient and useful. Microphone works great. Callers have no problem hearing me when I am riding.<br /><br />Cons : The speakers fit perfectly in the cut outs in the cheek pad,  I am not sure if the position needs to be adjusted, but I can feel them press against my ears. Are they uncomfortable?..  I would say, a little,<br /><br />Overall I am happy with my purchase.
B004AIHKT2|5|I purchased this interlock to replace the factory-installed plastic interlock that broke on my Chrysler Pacifica. It was an easy replacement. I love that it came with two different springs, so I knew one would work if the other didn't. I feel confident that this one won't break the way the plastic part it replaced did.
B003UMV9ZK|5|works great
B004I0XJUG|1|Yea, this would be negative stars, if I could!  So, yes these do 'look' great - but before you waste your time & money - just don't buy them, better off getting the real deal!  These lights DO NOT ADJUST to meet inspection regulations & safety limitations!!  (this is why they sell them so cheap - they are just good looking shells) & the company will blow you off if you have a problem - so go right ahead, they'll take your money!!  & if I'm not mistaken, I had the SAME (though I should of learned) issue with some VW Jetta lights I purchased in 2008!  Worthless, non adjustable junk!!!  Will be putting in complaint with BBB & sending this JUNK back!!
B004K23KQ0|5|Item was perfec as it was describe fast shipping excellen seler
B00ASN7XG8|4|It was perfect!
B00T7DR7FW|5|Nice switch
B000C848Q2|5|Quality product at a great price
B002UPMU60|5|love it
B000NUDE4G|5|Shipped quick and after installing my engine doesnt shake my entire car now!
B00BQS9GCI|5|Very good
B00IO9C98A|5|Night roctor
B00755LAO8|5|Came out great on my 99' Jeep Cherokee! East Coast Love!
B00843WHB0|5|Awesome product!!!!
B000GZNTQ6|2|They're not bad to look at but I can't make them fit my Japanese or German bikes.<br />Too much chrome?<br />I'll try sand paper.
B00559WHSE|4|works well. no problems so far
B00KL3ALGO|5|The sun shades work great.  I have had too many issues in the past getting the suction cups on other sun shades to stick.  These eliminate that problem.  I definitely recommend them!
B00K17A2E6|2|DOES NOT FIT. even though my 13 Charger uses these fuses, the housing on this unit would not fit. I even cut down the fuse placement in the fuse box in my engine in order to get this closer to the actual metal fuse receivers, but it still didn't work. Even if I would have found a way to tape it in the position it still comes lose and falls right out. PLUS, one of the fuses that came with this actually split apart when I tried removing it and replacing with a different size. Totally not worth it.
B008L15WJ4|5|REAL NICE hat!
B002E581BY|5|Installed this about 3 weeks ago has been working great. Found it was super easy to install on my 2003 Pontiac vibe, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whTVPl2ZQJc. Job took about 20 minutes.
B0006JO0X8|3|Does not work for long
B000Y80V20|5|Fast shipping works great
B004SEVSCS|1|Worked about a week  ..still let's heat come out
B00WJ0LE86|4|The product was fine, no complaints, it just took a little more time and patients to complete the install...
B00BQVDW5C|5|great gloves - fit as expected
B001MU5JOE|5|Installed these in an Acura MDX with transverse engine. Perfect replacements, gap was correct from factory, and completed work quickly. Two months later and the plugs are flawless.
B002XM59F4|5|Perfect fit for our RV.
B004RV4STW|5|Perfect for the car
B0073XTN14|5|I'm very impressed by the quality of this antenna. It works perfectly on my 2005 Corolla and looks far better than the stock antenna. Highly recommended.
B00WFJ6YRM|1|I used this strap on my 14 foot aluminum boat for about a month, and it already was ripping in half near the buckle. I only used it 4-5 times, and my trip to the boat launch was 10 minutes round trip. For the strap to already rip after this little of use is completely unacceptable. I have returned this item. Do NOT buy this because it has a low price point.
B000YMP1SA|1|This is the worst Item I have ever Bought it has difficulty inflating a bicycle tire.
B00SZI0C8Y|4|Got this in the mail, plugged it in, and has worked like a charm ever since on my '99 Subaru Forester S. Only witholding a star because since it is new I have no idea about the longevity of the part. It looked just like the OEM part to my eyes when I did the replacement.
B00AJYWM62|5|A+
B00DJ4FOQ4|5|Everything was on time and works ok
B003VGM8K0|4|Just what I needed
B00AM0WA1U|4|There's nothing fancy about this product.  It blocks the sun and improves the visibility of the LCD display during the day.  That said, it does lack &#34;polish.&#34;<br /><br />From the picture, I honestly envisioned the part being made of a dark, translucent-smoke plastic.  Instead, what arrived was plain opaque textured plastic, and it would have looked better if it was color-matched to the interior trim.  I might see about repainting it to match.<br /><br />Otherwise, my only other issue was the tight fit.  The top has a tab which inserts between the stereo and surrounding trim.  The instructions tell you that you may need to &#34;file&#34; this down for an easier fit.  That's a BIG thing to ask the consumer to do.  Not everyone has access to the kind of tools that will reliably cut into this material and shave off an even amount on each pass.  A better design, other than thinner material for the tab, would be to etch a &#34;notch&#34; along the base of the tab so once it's fully inserted, the natural tension of the trim panel would grip and hold the visor securely in place.
B00CT8JSE0|5|Nice unit so far.  I love that it has an A, B & C speaker output.  We'll see how long it lasts.<br />Note:  This unit is wider than the standard RV wall-mounted stereo.  You'll have to make the hole bigger.
B004LF90QK|5|Terrific toilet for our trailer. Its got lots of holes for water to flush thru, and the sprayer is very helpful.
B00247DI3I|5|Works very well, high quantity for the price.
B000CBQXH6|5|I had to return as it was the wrong application. My fault
B003VBGGU8|5|Makes hanging light easy.
B00Y9GJCHS|3|In condition
B000CMJ1T2|1|Very hard to install, poor instruction diagrams pertaining to original parts which must be present & used
B002X7VH1Y|5|This is the best product I have found yet for keeping your Granite top  beautiful without tons of effort.
B0002V9IFU|5|Left my car feeling clean
B0054YCW62|1|After one use one of the bungee cords tore.  In addition, the plastic hooks are not heavy duty and break very easily. This product has an attractive price, but it definitely isn't in for the long haul.
B00I04Q79G|5|Awesome fit my 2004 350z perfect easy to install
B006H34AE6|5|I got this when I got a Norwex mop, instead of the rubber brush Norwex sells, which is almost identical and twice the price. This works great for cleaning the dry mop. Haven't used it on couch or clothes yet, but it's great for the purpose for which I bought it. I tied a little loop of ribbon around the handle, so I could hang it in the closet on the same hook as my dry mop when not in use. Works great!
B005Y0O7MI|5|I have not installed these yet but I am impressed by the quality. The metal has some nice weight to it and is very smooth and it has a nice slight curve to the bottom so it should fit nicely on my roof. I do wish that I had gotten the LED version but could not find it available. I will convert to LED myself.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Did what it was supposed to do. Barely noisy while strapped, and secure. Happy with the purchase.
B0002SRCYM|5|Works as advertised
B00FPJJ85Y|5|If i had a car I'd buy this/
B005Z0ESFS|5|just what i needed
B004HLWPO2|5|INSTALLED VERY EASILY
B0002JSZ8I|5|Ver y good
B000PW9S7E|5|I use this stuff whenever I clean out my car, putting it most everywhere inside and outside along the back bumper, etc.  It goes on easily, seems to absorb quickly.  I feel like it is doing its job of protection in this rain-drenched climate.
