B006ZLRVOQ|4|I bought these pants for my boyfriend, ordering the size that he usually gets for his jeans and dress pants.  While these are nice pants, unfortunately, it seems that they run a little small.  I'd recommend buying a size up than you normally would so that it will fit comfortably.
B00BCE82CQ|5|Shirt arrived on time and was exactly as I expected. Fit perfectly.
B00573LJ1E|3|Excellent content. Shrunk significantly after only a few washes
B00J04R4GU|5|It fits perfect, love the material, will buy again!
B0007CKI4O|5|es muy cómodo este Wrangler Corte Fit original Jean, Denim Dark Stone, y de verda me gusto mucho, excelente tela, color y costura de primera, lo recomiendo al 100 % seguro,
B00C3U7YSQ|4|it's good but the fabric is not that thick ...<br />it's a little bit expensive<br />thank you very much<br />in time
B00KOOL7YU|4|I am 5'7&#34;, 38D and have long arms and broad shoulders and the XL fits great!  Not tight in the bust as most dresses this size are.  Hits at the knee on me.  The material is very nice and it is a borderline work/dress dress.  I can wear it to work or to a semi formal occasion.  Love this dress.  Love Calvin Klein dresses....they are not all made for smaller sized girls. :)
B004ARPYK0|5|Recently potty trained, our grandson got these big boy underwear in the mail to reward him from his grandparents who are 1200 miles away; he loves them and thinks of us everyday when he wears them!
B00E1XH0EQ|3|I try it right now, feel a little large and long,but I think is almost fit me, and I can do some little changes by myself
B00O7PEWWG|5|Looks great and are comfortable! I had to buy them for a formal white party. They aren't suit pants or tux pants but they do look very nice and I will feel comfortable wearing them to my event.
B001ATM134|4|The material is rougher than I am used to, and they don't quite fit me well at the hips and waist (I am VERY curvy though, so this is a common problem for me). Other than that they are fine.
B003ZTV9WQ|5|I got these for my daughter for christmas and she didn't take them off for 3 days!  Warm and cozy!  They are wonderful!
B00CISANZY|2|Nice quality but waist too small.  Fits in shoulders and chest but un-wearable and no return instructions were included in package.
B0063JN9FK|5|ok
B00CN6PA9A|5|I really like these pants. I was hoping for a cuff at the bottom, but it was hard to tell from the picture if there was one. Still very pleased with this purchase.
B00QVY91G8|5|just like in the pic
B00L1IBGSK|5|The fit and style are exactly as shown. Great price for a lovely springtime dress.
B00CRPHJ9Q|2|I ordered a small for both my purchases.<br />Received my package one wrapped in plastic wrapping was the accurate size, then this was wrapped in the other top purchase 2x larger size !<br />Very disappointed
B001AWCDKC|1|It looks to fake, like hair of a Barbie doll, even the hair of the Barbie doll looks better.
B00KI16TQK|3|It did the job. I am a 32 DD and these worked for an evening of ballroom dancing. They did not do a great job of lifting my breasts, but they held them in place and stuck the whole night.
B00188I6TA|5|It does its job, and its sharp. Its not too big like other reviewers claim. Perhaps if you wear it with one of those silly looking skinny ties or whatever. If thats the case, go to american apparel or urban outfitters, where you buy your skinny ties, skinny jeans, skinny suspenders, etc and buy a skinny tie clip...hipster!!!
B00A5BE37U|5|And it was a hit! I love these kind of &#34;evolution&#34; non-verbal statements and this one did not disappoint any of us. Good buy for anyone into guitars...
B00JLQOIPC|2|The product was described as pigment dyed. This was not the case. It has more of a ironed-on feel.<br />The size description of the shirt was accurate.
B000WJYY2Y|1|This costume is cheaply made and did not last through even one night of trick or treating. I had to re-sew the seams and work on it so my son could wear it to school. Do not order this unless you just want to waste your money.
B00VH8XJN4|5|Good quality tee shirt
B002STIDZ0|5|It's been wonderful!  My daughter is BEGGING to put this nightgown on at night.  As soon as the sun goes down (it's winter, so we're talking 5pm) she's asking if it's time to put on her pajamas.  We'd been fighting the last few months because she was wanting to sleep in dress-up costumes that she got for her birthday and Christmas, but this sorted that all out.  It's very well made.  I got it a size bigger, and I'm glad I did, because she struggles a bit to get her arms through (and she's a skinny minny), though that means the skirt is a bit long.  It's pretty much rendered the remainder of her pajamas pointless though.  When she goes up a size, I'll just get a couple of these disney nightgowns instead of wasting our time with the footie and other style PJ's.  (I haven't found any other companies that are making anything like this quality nightgown - that really is like a gown).
B00L3BBPPO|5|This is an amazing blouse, it's pretty, stylish, and I already received a few compliments.  Very happy with this blouse
B009T6XHQU|5|Finding a hoodie for an adult what is not overly graphic is hard to find! This hoodie was a big hit and had just the right amount of tasteful graphics.
B0008EOESC|3|it is not fit ,it is very loose. and it's fading very hard and it still attract dust.I am slim so I can't wear it.
B004L6J5KA|1|Burn out is an understatement. This shirt is see through and small fitting.  Not what I expected.  Not recommended buying.
B005L3KIOY|3|I chose 3 stars due to seller's lack of detail to product quality. I ordered item twice and both times it came with a defect. What are the chances of getting 2 defective items in a row. This makes one think all items they sell are like that.<br /><br />Likes;<br />* Design - It is great to be able to use your hands and cover them right back when done to stay warm.<br />* Inside Material - The inside is made of really comfortable material and very warm.<br /><br />Dislikes;<br />* Defective - It  came with a defect the two times I ordered this same product. It first was torn from the top side of the left hand, on the second time it was tearing also on the left side, but this time on the part that flips to cover the fingers.<br />* Not wind proof - The wind does filter a little through the fingers cover part. If you use them on temperatures below 40f, you will notice this.<br />* Size - They are bulky. Getting gloves that allow you to use your fingers should convey the idea of a product that is as seamless to the over all use of your hands as possible.
B00SLRZU36|5|I love the RubyK Womens Long Sleeve Open Knit Cardigan!  I have bought it in several colors.
B00KDLU5V0|1|Shirt was made very small.
B003QSZOYK|5|Back to school uniform.  Haven't actually worn yet but appears to fit well.  The real test will be durability.
B00EWO3QJW|2|Sizes run very small and the zipper in front is low quality and difficult to zip
B008I0XAKG|5|Just received theses glove in black. THey are made and shipped from CHina. THe rouched gloves are beautiful.... very nice quality, warm and elegant.  I'm ordering more for relatives.
B00F0CT48M|5|Everything I hoped it would be.  Good fabric, excellent cut.  A very nice, sexy, feminine fit.  I love it.  I would buy so much more from Patty's Boutique but they mostly carry colors for blue toned skin types, not enough for yellow tones.  We need more coral, orange, bright yellow and gold, champagne, red-orange, bright green, cinnamon.
B0052B8A5Y|5|My husband LOVED the costume.  It fit him perfectly and he looked amazing.  We were both surprised and happy that most of the materials of the costume were not really cheap.  It made it through a 4 day bachelor party cruise without falling apart or messing up.
B00W0N5YZG|3|Waaaaay shorter than expected
B0076R55UA|1|The jacket fits small and the jacket came with a rip in the hood
B00IUNFZP4|5|perfect for that little pony person, fits size womens 6-10,fun to give as gift
B00F7H6JB0|5|excellent top for the price
B00Q5W2XGG|5|perfect
B008R50VCC|5|color was darker than picture but still a great shirt and color<br />would recommend this for anyone true to size fit too
B00DN1CLVY|5|Comfortable chef shirt that gives kitchen workers a look that is professional.<br />So far, stains have been all coming out after a pre-treatment with Fels-Naptha soap and a wash that includes a bit of bleach.<br />Resists wrinkles.
B00JXDD5HK|5|I liked the swim suit so much I ordered 3 more in different prints!
B007Z8IMN2|4|I purchased this for use in the winter. I tend to let my hair grow out for warmth and in doing so, am unable to continue with my hairstyle of choice.<br />It works exactly how it should.<br />It's also a very tight knit item, so no worries about it tearing after a few uses.
B00H89JQIS|5|I'm normally a boxer brief guy but thought I'd give these a try... Normally I don't like trunks because they feel like they ride up over the course of the day. Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised with these as I soon forgot I was even wearing them. Even over the course of an active day they stayed put. I will be buying more very shortly.
B006FO1EGE|5|Head my Warning, The Wolf Moon Power tee has unparallelled side effects. I awoke after my first night wearing this epic T, covered in terrorist blood surrounded by 72 Arabian virgins.. correction 72 Arabian women. I tried to take the shirt off instantly but it resists all efforts to be removed, much as the black spider-man suit. I have tried chainsaws, napalm, and copious amounts of ky jelly,but this sucker wont let me go. It unleashes an ungodly rage inside of me when the moon is full or when I am in traffic; needless to say the carnage that follows is horrific. I write to you in hopes that you will resist the urge to purchase one of these Three Wolf Moon Power T's... This has become my burden; dont make the same mistake that I did. On a positive note, they are very comfortable.
B008D8FJJS|5|My partner was very pleased with this gift of 3 silk boxers.  The quality is great, the colors and patterns subtle but classy (I realy like the fluer de lis). He says the fit is perfect and loves the silky feel of the fabric.  All in all, I made a good choice for this birthday! Price was reasonable for the quality. Amazon made ordering easy and delivery fast.
B0013FHN3S|5|Does the job very well of protecting your Bible, leather feels durable and looks like it will hold up very well to the climate!
B00K5ZLN2Y|5|Bellisimos
B00CMO1N4O|4|Loved these shorts.  Very comfy.  The only issue that I had was that I wished it was tighter or pulled in a little at the bottom of the shorts.  Other than that, I have had no problems.
B00L8XPPTE|2|It's too large to wear
B00OE85A90|5|chest runs small but I love it
B00N2KPFCI|1|You only get a tube top, NOT the whole dress pictured above.  This is a scam by a Chinese company to dupe you into buying a &#34;Whole dress&#34; and you only get a top for the money you pay.  DO NOT buy!
B002XGZT5K|5|Got this for my wife for Christmas. She is always complaining she is hot. She absolutely loves this pj set. Says it is very cool to wear. She likes the styling. Packaging for Christmas was nicely done by Texere Silk.
B003O68PZ4|2|I thought being a corset the top would tie up in the back. But instead it has a poorly designed zipper that kept coming undone. It was a big in the breasts, tight in the stomach and the clear plastic straps are not removable. I ordered an XS and am 5'6&#34; 120 lbs. The top should not have been that large. Not to mention the skirt... it showed all of my bum! Unfortunately I took a gamble and ordered this a couple of days before Halloween. I had to return it because of the fit and didn't have a costume to wear that night.
B000OQ3J6M|5|I started walking to work and I was looking for a rain suit which would protect me from rain as it takes me about 25 minutes to walk to work. I tested it in heavy downpour and it kept me dry. I did buy one size larger than I needed as suggested by other reviewers and now I can wear my small backpack without any problems and it keeps my stuff too dry(in backpack). It is nice suit can also work as windbreaker/light jacket for light/minimalist backpackers. The hood is nice and can be unfolded even while you are wearing the jacket. The hood stays in the jacket collar and is held by a Velcro which is very easy to undo. The only downside was that it took almost 4 weeks to ship, but I think it's advertised that it ships in 3/4 weeks.
B00CBWL3PQ|5|Love the fit. So comfortable!!! The denim is very soft!!  Great jeans. Love the color too. Love these jeans. Awesome
B004A7XY84|4|These are comfortable wearing panties.  As a plus size woman it is hard to find ones that the elastic doesn't stretch or that the crotch is big enough.  Another brand that is popular and I quit wearing because they stretch so badly and the crotch is just about an inch wide.  My only complaint is that I wish they would offer them in an all beige pack.  The colors are okay but women my age (66) don't want bright colors.
B0042AV774|4|Very well made and pretty
B00HVVNJTU|4|It's hard to find front-close bras in bigger sizes. This is a good solution, but slightly small. The cups are double lined with fabric that provide some coverage but not not full coverage.
B00HSE42PK|4|Good quality material. Fitting is exact.
B006ZVYIZ6|5|They arrived quickly, fit well and have held up well with regular use.
B0012YFEEU|5|excellent product; timely delivered; met all of my expectations; would recommend highly
B00G7O0MWE|3|Maybe order the next size smaller. I wear a 34 waist and after several wash cycles they were still loose in waist.
B00CJCQEHA|5|Very hard to find local.  I am a diabetic and these are very comfortable to wear. I bought some on ebay, every other one was damged, never again!!!!!
B00HCN6CU0|5|i love this cloth for its high quality and good design.true to size.very comfortable and stylish.thank Amaozn.love it very much
B00E2NSK12|1|What had the potential to be an absolutely stunning outfit turned out to be the funniest thing I've ever seen! The top was WAY small. It looked like two little triangles covering my boobs. Granted, I'm not a small chested lady but that wasn't the worst part! I'm also not a tall person (5'5&#34;) and when I put this on it literally went to right below my knees. I wish you could post pictures under reviews because I don't think you can appreciate the disaster this outfit was without seeing it yourself... If I was 4'6&#34; with an A-Cup this outfit would have been beautiful. I love the color and the material and I really am sad it was so awful. I didn't return it because quite frankly, for that price it's not' worth the trouble. Great idea, unfortunately it wasn't executed successfully... That's what I get for not paying attention to the reviews...
B00331BZT8|5|Very high quality, true size, fit very well on my son. His height is 6'5&#34;, and sleeves are perfect length. I will recommend this jacket to everybody who looks for good rain coat.
B00DN9ZTU6|5|NICE PANTS
B004CMB60A|5|Hey, if you don't need a whole lot of stuff to carry around in your wallet, this is the answer for you!  Love it!
B00CA9KGYY|5|As expected!!
B00142DC9Y|1|the size is smaller than actual. I bought two other 9 months bumpkins and when compared side to side it was twice larger. Beware this looks like a slim fit!!
B003XC9EOU|4|Fit good!
B007KM9Z70|2|This product is being advertised as shown; however it's a completely different design in reality….eg it  shows as a kind of Caribbean style but in reality it's only a striped sky blue and yellow bow tie --- Not a bow tie with mixed colors with red, green, blue and yellow combo act……* It's being presented falsely ---I was and am really disappointed*  the only reason I haven't sent it back is due to the shipping costs vs. the actual cost of the bow tie being compared*
B005M02VLY|1|$75 for a plain white t-shirt???? Wow!!! Even at $20 it's rediculous! Really, wow! Is this t-shirt made of white gold?
B00G26U5ME|5|All good.
B00HRN5GDO|3|Get one size bigger than usual
B002ZTK9QE|5|Perfect size, and holds my cards in an easy to get to way.  I am going to get several as gifts:-)
B00OLBRQIS|3|Rides low.
B0058ZQSQ2|5|All ok
B0065NWHB6|5|Just right replacement lenses, all OK.
B00BTPQDZG|4|Fits good.  Great for Halloween
B0040YH8J8|5|Very pretty costume .
B00RY9ZMSK|4|The bow tie came in a timely fashion and looks very good on me. I don't know if its my facial hair or the tie but small threads are starting to come up
B003F06XQW|4|Great hat, perfect for my costume, but the portion that rests on your head is much more shallow than I expected. This makes the chin strap an absolute necessity, and I recommend a wig cap to cover your hair, as the back does not come down as far as it should.
B00847H4AK|5|GREAT FOR THE PRICE
B00M2A7ZQS|5|Got this for my husband and he does love it! It is a beautiful wallet and great for his needs. We have no idea if the RFID blocking works but will take it on faith that it does. The Python Gray is very pleasing.
B00LX0AEI4|5|Love this dress, my daughter does as well!
B00RF2OB92|5|I ordered three cardigans from two different sellers to compare each. This one in particular resulted in the same brand &#34;azules&#34; and not &#34;viosi&#34; as stated. They are basically the same product different colors. Although all three have the same brand tag the size tags are sewn in different sites. The material of two, including the one ordered from this seller, is a bit different from the third sweater, and yet all three are 95% rayon 5% cotton, and between the three only one fits perfectly. This one is a tad on the small side and the third is way smaller especially the sleeves,  too short. However, overall I am happy with them. They are light and flowy. Perfect for those chilly restaurants and light enough for layering over a tank or spaghetti strap top. Difference between sellers, about a buck in price.
B00OYAJRVK|3|Cute dress, good quality.<br />Ordered a size up and still no where close to being able to zip.<br />Very disappointed.<br />Hopefully easy to return.
B00VRQ5NDK|5|This is such a beautiful dress!  It is well made and fits perfectly.
B007CFJXPE|4|nice
B0026P4I96|5|This is a great deal and fits perfect.  Good for everyday wear!  I bought one more yesterday just to have for everyday.
B0044BBSFC|2|I prefer my boobs to be in front of me and not squashed awkwardly towards the sides, so this bra didn't work for me.  Also, the bow is HUGE, I can't imagine that looking okay under a shirt!
B009L7YTYG|5|Purchased as a gift and it was a huge hit!<br />Thanks so much!
B00O5AN37S|5|Very soft.
B00JQ7FM8I|4|Really nice and warm. I wear it often. Began showing signs of wear around wash #3, but still going strong after the 10th.
B00KK3TJP4|5|I love it, I really recommend  this item
B005EM4C3K|4|I was not impressed with how stiff these cloths are, even after washing.  The designs are cute, and they seem pretty absorbant.  I guess my only complaint is that they aren't as soft as I thought they would be.
B00SNRD14Y|5|LOVE this. It is so cute and newborn fits baby at 7 lbs perfectly with room to grow. The color is a little more neon than the picture shows and so cute in person!!
B006EXSTT6|5|I got this hat for a girl from my bible study and its her favorite accesory! soft, durable, comfortable, and machine washable!
B00AMCFKCY|4|very nice delicate and comfortable
B000Y8G1CE|3|I purchased these pants for my husband and they are comfortable but don't come out of the dryer<br />without wrinkles.  I am one who leaves the dryer running and takes one piece out at a time and I fold them and run my hand over them but they still need to be pressed.  Since it takes me a while to get to pressing things, no a great idea for future purchase.
B00B4W7LRI|5|This is hella comfy, I got a large because I'm kinda big around the hips but my butt is like a small or medium but otherwise, I love it
B00063DNSM|5|I purchased this jacket for my Dad for Christmas. He LOVES it! He wears it everywhere. The color has held up great, it looks awesome.
B00KACMFB0|5|nice recommend it
B00NO3X2YQ|5|I already had this jacket in the Grey shade and absolutely LOVED it!  I was SO excited to find the Indigo Ink/Navy on Amazon and ordered it right away!  I will also be ordering the Black one!  These jackets are perfect...just the right weight and are so comfortable.  They have just the right amount of &#34;stretch&#34; to them that allows you to move with ease, without obtaining that worn, &#34;stretched-out&#34; appearance.  DEFINITELY recommend!
B00F6A7GC4|3|Very well made but I would consider this JR sizing and not womens.
B00KQTJRU4|4|I like the thin cotton for coverage over a tank top on hot summer nights when out with friends.  The details are quite pretty.
B00C1Z25FK|4|Shipped quickly, fits well, but the material is a little ruff
B00P0DQI8U|5|🌟
B00B8SS8MK|4|My daughter loved it!
B00ORQ37NU|5|My daughter loves this. Perfect for tights or skinney jeans and knee high boots. A bit immature. More for younger crowd
B004FWYDEI|5|This sash was great for HS prom.  I would make sure you take it out of the packaging a few days in advance to smooth out the wrinkles.
B003Z050L6|3|This hankies are not for a man are for a child, looks good but too small and cloth too thin fabric.
B0013FHN3S|1|The Zipper broke! brand new...no good
B00BNBBGOE|4|Very nice bra. Comfy.  It is a completely different bra than a previous one I ordered in xl; it was the blue one and I'm disappointed in the difference. The blue one, model 3488, has a liner in it and was way too big.  I ordered one in a different color and size, but it's a completely different model!  This light beige one, model 3484,  doesn't have a liner and is very thin; no support and I'm afraid to wear it when it's cold!  With the liner in the blue one, it adds support and I'm missing that in this one.  I wear a 36 C-D and am not in good shape, and the medium fits great! Okay, looks like I made the mistake of assuming these two bras were the same!  When I looked at the other one, it says foam cups right in the description!  Ignore my review except how comfy it is!
B00FAWJQAS|5|Can't wait to wear my Gloria Vintage Style Wool Hat next week when I head to NYC....love it!
B005SGIJZO|5|This is a fantastic pin for anyone who's a fan of asian cuisines like sushi or just loves rice.  This button is even gluten free!  Back in middle school and high school I learned that pins were a great decoration for backpacks and jackets.  They're inexpensive and don't take up much room but they allow you to easily express yourself and make great gifts.  This one is well made too so it won't fall apart quickly.
B000MX936C|2|I ordered a 36 & 38 DDD, not knowing which would fit. The 36 DDD was too tight around & small in the cup, the 38 DDD was too large in the cup and while it fit around, it pokes into the under arm area- just too much coverage on the sides. Definitely not the same cup size, even though it claims to be. I washed the 38 thinking it might shrink enough to fit, but it didn't. Will send the 36 back, but am stuck with the other.
B00GNSFTHC|2|The look is good. However, this watch has a very poor quality buckle, and will always get loose. I waited one month for it to arrive, and lost it the first day of wearing.
B00GTMLHE6|4|Perfect wardrobe staple which can be dressed up or down. Pairs nicely with a tee shirt and jeans or can be worn a little dressier as well. Good retro look.
B0041OLI66|5|Picture doesn't really do this wallet justice. It's really nice. And the price isn't bad either. Would purchase again.
B007ZYVFM6|5|The \\"Poncho\\" came in the mail very fast! its soft and drapes well. I got a size 3X and i have a 44G Bust and it still looks great! I recommended it to a friend!
B001FWK7BY|3|I liked the taller height on this bandeau and it seemed really well made, but the size small is still just enought too big around for me (I normally wear 32 A/B). The removable pads are nice, but it still doesn't help out my small chest much. I think it would be great for average-chested women, but it's not quite right for my smallness.
B00QU21LLE|5|I bought the Common Fibers Max through the original Kickstarter so I've used mine for a few awhile now. I have to start by saying that discovering this wallet on Kickstarter was a fantastic experience. I hadn't carried a wallet in years because of the bulk that it took up in my pocket. The Max easily holds more than I used to carry and does so in less space. The carbon fiber body and ripstop interior both look like new despite daily use. This wallet has gotten more than a few comments and I've actually grown tired of telling people where I got it. The Common Fibers Max wallet is without a doubt the only wallet I will ever choose to carry because it holds everything I need without bulging out a pocket.
B0093KTFBI|5|Nice bright red colour.<br />I love its texture very much. The length is perfect for me.<br />It fits my body contour very well.
B000LXD9N6|5|Nice fit. Thin and comfortable while keeping feet warm and dry. You recommend for everyone looking for a nice comfortable fit.
B0031U0QBO|5|I'm a tall 6' 2&#34; guy and these fit perfectly. I actually bought more pairs...
B002N3AMCS|4|Great costume!  It's very comfortable and kept it's shape all day
B003IHOORC|4|Highly recommended.  Stretch waistband is great when you have a large meal.  I have all three colors. Fabric is soft and the leg and crotch have enough room.
B0091W7KUG|5|Very nice and stylish!
B006Z7758M|1|Would love to rate this product, been waiting 3 weeks for it.
B007ZHPQNW|5|Very good denim not too thick nore thin.Delivered fast.Perfect fit,I'm 5'2&#34; and weigh 106 lbs,ordered size 25 and it is ideal.Dark color is very flattering and super sexy.
B0099K8RGQ|4|When I got this - I was a little disappointed because the white part of the stripes hits my belly right where I didn't want it. The fabric is almost silky - it's soft and drappy - and it clings to that little spot. HOWEVER - wearing a spaghetti strap shirt under it, fixed everything. (I get them small and fitted, perfect).<br /><br />There is a little band of fabric around the upper arm that sort of guides the sleeve. I didn't mind, just letting you all know.<br /><br />The cowl neck can be a little &#34;HI HOW ARE YOU&#34; if you don't have boobs, like me. Or can cause the shirt to shift off one shoulder or another - But, with a shirt under, no problem.<br /><br />Ok - honestly - this has become one of my go-to shirts. I love that it is longer in the sleeve and hip. The color is great - the strip is nice and even if you are like me and a little self-conscience about your belly - it still looks fantastic.<br /><br />PattyBoutik really does a great job with clothes. Also, I am about 5'7 130-135 and I got a medium. If you ever ordered anything from Patty before, this sizes the same. I think anything bigger would be a tent and anything smaller might not have that cool drap effect.<br /><br />Buy it. Go for it.
B00C3AWIJ6|1|Way toooo small. Not close to sizing....
B00GFH0RA0|5|This coat is a beautiful blue color and I love the design and material. I would recommend this jacket to anyone it is a beautiful color and jacket!
B002W8K02G|4|We are doing a 5K run this year and it was awesome to find shirts to fit our team name
B00OJJD9PQ|5|Even at my smallest weight I never had an hourglass figure. I didn't really have curves but it never bothered me until recently where I've gained so much weight. I was hoping this would help me on a girls night out where I want to look hot or on a first date with a guy. This gives you an instant hourglass figure which is nice! I'll be looking forward to waist training so the look is permanent. I'll be sure to post an update in a month
B00E3V9MT2|3|I do like this swim suit but I can't wear the bottoms! They are supposed to be medium but look like a child's small... But the top fit but is still a little big. Still like the color though I won't be able to wear it.
B00CLFXT3M|1|Am damn vex! The hat is too small. I wasted my money could of gotten another brand. By the way my son is 27mths.
B000N3Q74M|5|Little ironing and the waistband having some give makes them very comfortable.
B004GXA732|3|Bike shorts are supposed to be snug-fitting, but these hug my butt a little closer than I'd like (and my posterior is one of my trimmer features!). I think I'd also prefer something an inch or so longer, and the fabric puckers a little here & there.<br /><br />But otherwise they're comfortable and functional. I wouldn't buy another pair but will use these until I find something better.
B000V0706G|4|Love this costume! I read the reviews before purchasing so it fit as expected. Was nice and warm for a halloween night in WV!  My 11 month old loved dressing up with his Batman brother and the costume was better than expected. Definitely worth the $!
B00485BEHQ|4|It is an excellent garment--great control and the top band never slips out of place!!!  I highly recommend this and even prefer Dr. Rey's shapewear to very well known manufacturer--I have tried both!  I also have the firm control high waist with legs to knee.
B0002THX18|5|excellent
B0000644TP|4|I bought this hat last year. It is the same design, different colors.  It is red white and black.  I like it a lot.  It keeps me warm and my friends love it.  This might sound pretty stupid but the only bad part is that it is quite hard to hear with it on.  It covers your ears.  Keeps them warm too.  It doesnt fall off like some hats do, and it looks good with almost anything you could wear.  I would buy this hat again if I hadnt already.  It rocks.
B00882R26M|5|I love it, It really looks nice on. I have had many compliments.  I plan to get it in another color as it really fits well and it looks much more expensive than it it
B00W4NFP8I|4|Like it. If it was slim fit I would love it a lot!
B00MP1ZFGG|4|Runs small but daughter still likes them and wears them as they did stretch out.
B007MRMR46|4|my niece loved this hat and everyone thought it was super expensive but it wasn't :) great deal for the price!
B005D743ZI|5|Perfect weight and perfect size.  Fits as all Carter's - long and slim.  Love it - wish I had one.
B00EOIF4KU|5|I love this set, the shirt is very soft  and the shorts sit well and a good quality.
B00IJHK3KI|1|This could not be an XL. I know I'm big but this would only fit about a size 8 or 10 body!
B005JTBAE2|5|Good product, not like most wallets that tear or rip easily
B008XOXNKE|3|The sizing fit as expected but the material is stiff and unpleasant. Overall though, nothing wrong with them.
B00JZNE86A|5|It was a perfect fit. She loves it! We will probably be ordering more clothes in the future. Thanks so much!
B00006GEUG|5|it is a very classic baseball cap, quality is ensured by the brandname itself. I like it. If you want to get directly from the regular store other than internet, you need to pay at least 10$ more!
B008U7P5GE|5|Feels great, fits great, is great!  I will say that this seems like more of an undershirt than a t-shirt, but I love it.  I would definitely buy more.
B000EWYX02|2|The rack itself is quite nice, very light yet very strong. <br />It came with no mounting parts except the front pieces. I will have to make my own mounts for the rear. <br />I know that I could hassle with amazon or the seller but it just is'nt worth the time or trouble. I do know that I will not order anything from this seller again. <br />The two stars are for the build quality only, not happy.
B00ITY4S9I|1|This shirt is of awful quality. I purchased it for my husband to wear when our first child is born. I washed it and tumbled dry low as it said on the label. It shrunk so much on low that my husband can't wear it when our baby is born. I would not recommend this shirt for anyone.
B005TR6FTY|5|I just love these socks. They are so soft an good looking. All the colors in this set are absolutely gorgeous. I couldn't be happier with them. My baby always gets compliments every time she wears them.
B00R2HOJR4|3|i ordered a medium and it was so tight i couldnt get it over my head. it does NOT fit as expected
B00HZJ8ZBK|5|The shirt fits great! The package came earlier than it was supposed to.
B008RMZXAK|4|Great fit, stays put
B00FBSUNNA|5|love it for my spin class.  it dries quicker than anything else that I have in my clothing.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />-Triathlete, marathoner, etc.
B00168A6MC|5|These are the best sunglasses I have ever owned as far as comfort and visibility are concerned. I bought them for my husband, and they do look great on him, but decided to keep them for myself due to how amazing they feel. They are really lightweight, resulting in less indentation from the nose pieces. So far, this pair seems fairly sturdy too. I tend to be pretty hard on my sunglasses (should really take advantage of the nice case which came as a bonus with this order) but thus far, there is nary a scratch on them. I am keeping my fingers crossed that Jimarti will release a couple more feminine models, but am planning to order a second pair of these sunglasses today, as they really feel terrific.
B00F6C122M|4|My height 178 cm, weight 65 kg, wear M size, but some tight under the arms, the other is good.<br />This coat looks like a shirt, but the thickness and size, more like a coat.
B0002TORIU|5|These are the most comfortable socks I have bought. They are nice and thin and do not bunch up when I put my loafers on. They also stay up. They come up to a normal length on your leg, not too tall nor too short. I tried the Gold Toe Fluffies but they bunched up, sagged and were too warm for Florida.
B00CXQFT5U|5|Very pretty and girly! Fabric is nice. Good construction. Ordered an xxlg only because i wanted good breast coverage. Im regularly a size 9. 5'9&#34; tall. So being a 34 DD is hard to find good coverage. This worked great. Glad i estimated right.
B00XJG2COE|2|Was disappointed, I ordered two sizes bigger than needed an it still felt like it was at least two if not three sizes too small.<br />The shirt itself looked fine.
B00A0ELOPG|5|It is pretty nice, kind of long because I'm short, but I taked this pant with a professional desingner, the pant looks as ariginal lengh, I would like if you design them in short lengh too.
B00GTCO8HO|4|This fit nicely and looks good. It looks ok without the jacket too. I would buy it in another color if they had it.
B007LBD3PA|5|This fits great in with my wardrobe, and I get many compliments when I wear this ascot. one comment, however -it's a bit lighter than pictured (more of a royal purple as opposed to eggplant, in my opinion)
B00TG4SSRS|4|My daughter is tall and slender. This bathing suit fit well.
B005DIKXJM|5|Great place to shop...jeans fit great
B003IBW27W|5|These boots are AWESOME! They look just like Gene's!  Now I need to get the costume to go with it haha!
B007CDER2U|5|Love this wallet. Use it when I go to Disneyland and already received 2 compliments about my wallet. It's perfect for my money, has enough space for it, and enough space for my Disneyland annual pass, Drivers license, and credit card. It's the perfect size!
B0074OC4AY|5|My small 2 yr old fits comfortably in the 3T onesies.
B00C1Z2GU4|5|This sports bra is by far the best sports bra I have ever had. It does give you a unibeast but since I'm a DD or DDD depending on the bra it is normal to have a unibeast. I did by a band size bigger in this bra and it is tight but it is not to tight. The bra gives the BEST support I have ever had in a bra of any kind. I bought 2 other sport bras at the same time and neither come close to this one. I highly recommend this bra for big breasted women.
B0089NM9RC|5|A great book sock that I would definitely recommend! They fit snug but not too tight. They are truly a safe purchase.
B00ITKWXOE|5|I really like these--they are very comfortable.  I was afraid they might have a seam on the bottom, which a lot of brands do now, and was unable to get an answer about it so just decided I'd chance it.  They do not (Great!!!) and I plan to order more.
B00AXX86TG|5|I bought this to wear to a music festival (ACL in Austin, TX). It is very flattering yet comfortable. I got many, many compliments on it when I wore it. The top is a denim-type material that really accentuates the bust and waist. The bottom is very flowy. The belt it comes with is also quite cute and I wear it on a regular basis with other dresses and outfits.
B00062NHGQ|4|good
B008K81L1Q|5|I thought I reviewed this already, but here goes,, wife liked it, ,she is a large up top and probably a XL on her bottom ( glad she doesnt read my reviews)  the boyshort panties fit find but would ride up and stay in the crack,  this seemed to be a turn off for my wife and hence she has not worn this since, not even just the top with her normal granny panties.  I was trying to get her something nicer to wear than one of my T-shirts or some old grand mother looking long tshirt she normally wears.<br /><br />Seemed like good quality for the price, fit fine up top, alittle tight on the bottom ( which like I said, panties were a large on a XL bottom)<br /><br />if some lady was not pear shaped as my wife, and wanted something nice to wear at night, this might be the item to get.<br /><br />bought in April, she wore it once, so I guess I wasted my money on it,  I liked her in it but then she has to wear it and I am not arguing with her about granny panties and long old lady tshirt anymore..
B00V3QV41O|5|it is stretchable so fits well...i am happy with my purchase...i am going to order more...
B004LX4ZHG|5|This bra is extremely comfortable and the larger straps and full back provide a lot of support.  I bought this bra to support my breasts while dancing and bouncing around and it has been faithful to my needs.  Also, because of how comfortable it is you can sleep in it if you wish to do so.  It opens from the bottom which is very convenient for t-shirt wearers.  It is also easily washed.  It is recommended to hand wash this bra but I throw it in the wash machine on delicate cycle and then straighten the breast pads out.  The bra has slits on either side so you can insert your fingers in order to straighten them out.  I would highly recommend this bra to anyone looking for a great bra.  I have found that paying the slightly higher prices for Motherhood Maternity bras is worth the investment.  Bras from other stores just don't last.  These MM bras last forever!  I am on child #3 and still wear the same MM bras I got half way through nursing #1.  Other bras didn't even make it half way through #1 and they were not nearly as comfortable as these either.
B0055B39SE|4|i love these overalls and got my baby several ones in different colors.... they fit very small so, could not use for too long.
B00HBYPIMS|4|Great
B008TUBCUU|2|The sizing is totally off, stated as 2-7 in amazon, misleading as the top came with size 4T printed on the collar. Needless to say, my 7yo is unable to wear this and I can't send back for an exchange as I'm staying overseas. It's a total disappointment.
B00AHRDNBE|5|Great bra.
B0051HFHS2|5|EXCELLENT
B00DAB27IY|3|Way shorter than the one in the picture. Gets a little staticky, aside from that it's a great wig.
B000F6H4L2|2|I've owned this case for about a year now. The leather is fairly decent, nothing to brag about but sturdy and fit for the job of protecting the iPod. My main gripe is with the belt clip, which is really quite pathetic. Very cheap plastic and the spring clamp was so weak that my iPod would regularly slip off my pants and fall to the ground. Had to resort to just sticking the iPod in my pants pocket.....not what I really wanted from a case.<br />This would be a good deal at a $10-$12 price point --- and if you didn't mind placing your iPod in your pockets.
B004GXA92Q|5|This sports bra worked out great for me. It fit perfectly and kept the girls right where they should be while walking on the treadmill or lifting at the gym. The mesh at the top was a non-issue since it's lined with a soft non irritating fabric.
B004GGT88E|5|I was a little worried from previous review about quality, but product is fine.. I mean how long is it supposed to last?? Just came back from weekend of camping and it protected my little one nicely. The only thing is that my almost 3 year old is very skinny at 24lbs. The outfit fit perfectly, many times I have to fold over his regular 24 month old shorts to stay on, the shirts collar fits snugly almost like a mock turtle neck and it was a little hard removing over his head, so if you have a chubby baby it might be too small a fit
B0046DZL1A|3|Ok. Not size expected.
B006W4V7XM|2|Chest pocket Button fall, do not nailed<br />Longer than the sleeves lined sleeves<br />Many sutures are not parallel, very rough<br />Do remember not to buy the leather from India, too bad
B00D8RVKQU|4|This shirt is beautiful And I like the color blue And white, i can recomend to Everyone.....vainilla Star cute And casual clothes
B00QW32D0Y|5|This was originally $500 which seems crazy for a belt. Even at the sale price of $100 was extravagant for me but got it to round out a special outfit. It is well made and has a unique design and my only D&G item. I really like it. However I ordered the wrong size and it's way too big. 44 intead of 34 not sure what I did? My bad. I think it was the last one so probably won't bother returning. Only tried on once so really never worn. Asking around for someone who might want to buy it from me.
B005ZMJ928|4|Hi, i am very confuse with the Size i dont know what try to say with this<br /><br />2XL (US X-LARGE)<br />L (US MEDIUM)<br />M (US SMALL)<br />S (US X-SMALL)<br />XL (US LARGE)<br /><br />I am use a M size, what i need to buy?<br /><br />this one L (US MEDIUM) or this one M (US SMALL)<br /><br />Regards
B0073AFAMI|5|This sun hat not only arrived on time, but it surprised us positively. Both sides are super cute and the quality of the material is also very good. Our daughter is still too young to use it (4 months old) but we can't wait to see her in it!
B00JLDLRKO|5|I was kind of expecting to send it back because buying on line for toddlers is hard but it was the right fit for my 14 month old granddaughter I love it the color is bright and it is well made I am very satisfied with my purchase  .
B009VAJEI4|5|perfect fit, very comfortable and nothing moves!
B007WB53LQ|4|I've only had it for a short time but I really like it. I did a little modification to it because there's a scratchy decorative thing on the front. It just hand sewed it up and it works well.<br />My one side is a full cup size smaller and this bra fits it without being too small for the big side. It gives them a nice round shape and they are still soft to the touch, which my husband appreciates. Lol!<br />-Heather
B00CM26BMK|3|but after wearing it no more than 5 times some of the woven leather started to come loose.  So though this belt looks nice and does feel sturdy, the craftsmanship on it is very poor.  This has become a work belt instead of it's intended purpose of being a dress belt.
B00DZVMH1G|4|It's what my mother needed.
B009DVFA1Q|3|6FT 3 200 lbs about a 77 inch wingspan the XXL Asian fits great. The collar is a little loosy goosy and not stiff. As with all these asian clothes the zipper leads to nowhere.<br />I would only recommend because of Amazon prime. Way too much of a gamble with overseas shipping and quality varies way too much regardless of size. This is a hair below HnM quality. Dont consider this a long term buy.
B00LVBBW72|5|Love this little girls nightgown! Excellent quality as you would expect from Lanz!
B003H12GHO|5|They are super soft and I haven't had an issues with them. Definitely will be buying more! :)
B005Q8UTEI|4|It has a hole  where a seam is not stitched.  My mom will just sew it…..easier than returning it.
B001T7EV0S|5|Once again, I ordered this shirt for my brother for his birthday. He loved it. Thank you amazon for having such great companies.
B003XOOSN0|5|IT WAS A GIFT AND THE RECIPIENT WAS VERY PLEASED
B009P03PP8|4|When you first put these on they are really nice but after a while they get pretty loose and move around which gets pretty annoying. The fabric is pretty light which makes it a bit more breathable but definitely not more durable. They do good under looser fitting clothes but not so well under tight clothes. They are pretty much invisible under clothes though, which is very nice.
B00K5VPW7A|5|I get compliments on my back pack DAILY!
B003CVFBJ4|5|Nice smooth beads, and the beads are attractively knotted in between. Sturdy screw on clasp. I don't know if they help with teething or not, but i figure it can't hurt. I put it on my son's ankle most of the time to be safe.
B009O9YHQ6|3|It's a cheaper silky fabric that moves around too much. Rides up constantly. Cute shirt but makes wearing it uncomfortable. Order up a size. I didn't at first and had to reorder.
B00IYP7LR8|5|Bought this as a Christmas gift and she loves it!! She couldn't believe it was a real sweater. The wings and ears are adorable.. Besides that it fit perfect the sleeves run a little long but my niece happens to be a small 4 year old. She won't wear any other sweater now.
B004W2G380|5|Best pants for the money !
B00C7ZHGBM|3|I'm a size 3 or 5 depending on the brand and the small fits perfect and the shorts are cute.... Not too short in the back like I was afraid of. However I specifically searched for Wrangler cut offs and chose these ones and the shorts I received were Levi's and much less distressed than in the picture although maybe it will fray a bit once washed. Cute shorts overall but when paying $80 for them Id expect to receive what is pictured here not a completely different brand of jeans all together. If I had wanted Levi cut offs I had seen some on Amazon for $20-$30 =\ also no return label or invoice was attached for a simple return.
B00JKAWI9C|4|Fits as sized, material isn't quite as soft as I had hoped for, but it's adorable for my daughter. It's not by any means itchy, it just doesn't have that super sort sweatshirt feel
B00ACAD8IO|4|This hat is of very high quality, but my son would not keep it on. He just keep moving his head when I tried to out it on and when I finally got it in he took it off. But he did look adorable in it.
B008X9ZDLG|5|I like it. for the money it is worth it. I am a size 10/12 with a 38 dd, so the cup size is way small, but that is what I expected. Spilling over the top but that is what the hubs likes.
B00KS5A2G4|5|Great pair of jeans/leggings, especially at this price. Purchased size 2 and the fit was perfect. For reference: I am 5'5&#34; and weigh 145 lbs.
B000W1ZXTA|5|Excellent shirt, I think they have another one which has a \\"x's\\" for eyes on the groom. I like that one better than the one I got, but both are great and really get the point across... that I am taken.
B00JYNFMZC|5|beautiful
B00H7LXV88|5|Very nice summer dress in what I call hippy style. But then I used to be one.
B007KGE8S2|5|Good
B006MPIVIU|4|I loved this dress when I found it on the site and was very pleased to see the same thing arrive at my door. My daughter was adorable and she was a big hit at our Christmas festivities. The dress was a little snug in the chest but it fit fine for the occasion. The glitter does have a tendency to rub off a bit so be mindful of that. All in all I loved it and received many compliments.
B007KT7L42|4|Very simple addition for a  young flair  look.  I was mostly interested in the Color and it worked out well.
B007JBAS5A|5|this lambskin jacket looks and feels expensive.  a great deal at the price offered.  the zipper seems like it will last. Buy one!
B00SI7HUPA|3|paper thin though so good for summer, if fall/spring may need a jacket under
B005888MKE|5|good item  and seller
B009BQS1C8|4|It was what I EXPECTED
B003VTZO4E|1|I received this three pack of socks yesterday, put a pair on today, ran errands, got home, and there is a hole at the top of both big toes.  Not pleased at all.
B00HN8GVPU|3|The only problem i have is with the fabric its stretch spandex type and the open cleavage. Part just lets all of the girls out so u need to buy some clothing tape to keep it in place
B00347AG14|5|I have this shirt in every color. It's the most comfortable shirt I own and it looks really flattering because of the shape and stretch. The best part is that it is quick dry (I tend to get sweaty in the summer and this shirt keeps me really nice and cool and doesn't lose it's shape). Very high quality looks like a classy shirt but comfy for every day wear with sweatpants or jeans. Love these!
B001P67WHC|5|Perfect for my upcoming wedding!  Very affordable for a tie that looks like it should cost three times as much.
B00GJEKAE2|5|Thought the coins would be too light since it's so cheap, it actually do have some weight. Nice stuff for the price.
B00FYEY4YA|3|Medium is way long.  Quality is okay.
B00NTM6BE0|4|I wear a size 18 and the sleeves on the XL did not fit well.  Besides that, dress looks very pretty.
B00ETFRLCW|4|I bought this for my daughter, and she loves it! The headband on the earmuffs is adjustable, sliding in the fabric sleeve covering it. My only beef is the jewels on the tiara are somewhat lazily placed, but she doesn't care. The gloves are the super stretchy &#34;one size fits all&#34;.
B00CP0EEWS|1|It ripped after the first time I wore it.
B00L4RU2KQ|5|fits and feels better than any bra I have ever owned!
B00KS68R38|5|love it
B00DYQMQRC|5|The product feels really awesome, looks pretty well made too for the price. Saw one stray string, no big deal. I'm 5&#34;8' 135 lbs  and ordered a medium because everyone said that they always ordered larger than normal, but I'll be returning it for a small so that it's more of a slim fit like in the picture. If I were a bigger guy it would fit perfect. Looks very stylish too and broadens your shoulders just like you would expect any blazer or suit jacket from a high end retailer like men's warehouse would or Express, so I'm very pleased with the design. I was skeptical about the one button design but I actually like it. 10/10 Would get banged wearing this.
B00NQ7UXEM|5|First of all, the delivery was excellent, next day as stated!  According to the chart I should have ordered an XL but instead I decided to go with the reviews and get one size smaller (Large).  The first day, it was a little struggle trying to squeeze into the first set of hooks; however, I was able to do it.  To my surprise, after wearing it for a couple of days, I was able to close the second set of hooks! (I wear it for approximately 8 hours a day.)  Today is day six and I am able to close the third set of hooks.  Pros: the Cincher is great for anyone with poor posture.  Cons: it can become very uncomfortable when sitting as it digs into the upper rib cage.  In addition, I did measure my waist before ordering the cincher and it was 39 inches.  Today, I measured my waist and it is 37 inches and I just ate breakfast!  In less than one week I have lost two inches off my waist and I have not changed my diet or exercised; however, last week I was standing a little more than usual as a result of volunteer work.  Overall, I think it's a greats product for anyone beginning waist training such as myself.
B005F80QZQ|5|Bought for a friend for Christmas. Beautiful bright red color, it's thick and warm and looks like it'll last. I have no complaints, and would buy again. Keep in mind, however, since this is fleece, it does look more 'casual' than some other 'more dressy' material might. This looks like one you'd use for casual clothes, gameday, etc, rather than with a really nice coat.
B00EJ7ZUVO|2|Everything was good but...there was no mask as it said it was included.thats the piece that completes the costume
B00HA32NTG|5|The fit is perfect
B009Z3YU18|5|I bought this shirt for my brother. Measurments are accurate
B006ZHIDL0|3|Fan of Kangol generally, but this one didn't fit the bill, so to speak. Great colors, good fabric, nice weight for summer wear, but doesn't quite fit like a cap. Bill is longer than other Kangols I wear and just didn't look look right for me. Doesn't mean I won't buy more Kangols, but this one went back.
B00AATS50S|5|Tights are great -- fit baby perfectly.  Nice warm/fashionable footware.
B00DBBH6BQ|5|The KISS theory in action and so light you don't even feel the weight.
B00E00638Y|2|not satified
B009QR8MZI|5|Everyones Loves Pi!!
B00L31PDOS|1|Cheap fabric, poorly saw, fixed horrible (I am 5&#34;1´, 112 lb, so I decided to buy M size. It was too big for me.
B00469RQ5I|5|Part of it is that I have finally got a bra that fits properly, but this style the straps seem to stay up better than any other I have bought.
B0052TRV3I|5|nice product long shipping time thou but nice product
B0020B2FYQ|5|Awesome! Great item, true to size & very realistic looking!
B004ARXF4W|2|The item description says that the camisoles are size extra small (2/3).  When I received the item the packaging does indeed say that it is a size extra small.  However the back of the package indicates that extra small fits size 4!!  Way too big for my 2 y/o!
B00I8NZWZY|5|That's my first Lindy Bop dress and I was kinda afraid about the &#34;petite&#34; size. But it's just PERFECT! The dress fits exactly how I excepted! Can't wait to buy my next one!
B00EI3XUWK|4|Those bodysuits look very beautiful, but not very soft. Colors are very bright. I like bib, it is very soft.
B00H0IH57Q|5|This is really nice. The right color
B00486QEGG|5|These are so comfortable! They are made a very soft material, and silky to skin. The split is in the correct place, and didn't seem to bother the significant other at all. They have a little give to them so they aren't tight by any means. I've washed them once and they seemed to hold up pretty good as well. Think I will order the other color of these as well eventually.
B007WAYQ5G|5|Having successfully purchased a couple of other DKNY bras recently, I realized I needed a couple of strapless ones for the summer. I tried this one on and immediately knew it was right. I even did some strenuous maneuvers in the fitting room to make sure it wouldn't slip. I'm sure anyone seeing me would have thought I was a bit of a loon!<br /><br />Bottom line - very comfortable and stays in place:)
B00P2UA6DO|1|Washed it before I used it and it had a hole on the neck seam. Very poor Quality
B00IY8KXXE|5|Comfortable, good fit, great quality!
B002DYWPLI|5|Item was just as described and arrived very fast and this was perfect for our 80's themed party that we had! I am 6' tall and 240 lbs and they fit just fine.
B00A8FAAG6|2|I'm not a seamstress, but I know what I like.  I did not like this dress.  It was I'll fitting, thin and shearer than I thought.  The seams were wonky.  It did not meet my expectations at all.  I returned it.  Very dark also, impossible to tell it was navy instead of black until I brought it over to a window.
B00LI7GF2Q|5|very nice, cards fit well without difficulty pulling them out when needed
B009ETVFW0|5|Wonderful shirt, good quality, proper size, didn't shrink or fade when washed.  Very bright purple, gets some looks from people who don't play but those who do recognize immediately
B00OZMLW1U|5|Good product, I like it as expected. Thank you very much
B00DG7G9CW|5|Loved these pants and would definitely recommend based on comfort level, fit and affordability.  I use them for walking and aerobics which work perfectly.
B00NKEYFJA|3|Son loves it but a small part of the picture was pealed off when we received
B003ILIXS4|4|As in the scheme of body suits, I went a size larger, because the torso to leg ratio is never right and the bottom half usually cuts into my crotch. This does this less than usual. I think it was about as good a fit as I could get, considering I have an exceptionally long torso. I usually wear a 4-6 in womens, 5'3, muscle-y 145 lbs. The fabric is a lot thicker than expected, pretty nice quality.
B00NUYXXSO|5|Love the colors looks the same as the picture i love the fabric even after washing Recommended
B003AIKOGO|1|Ordered this kickee pants pajama set and got crappy Carter's cotton set instead. Obviously I'll be returning them
B000NRV64O|2|The quality of the hat does not match the value put on the hat.  I love the style of the hat but I fear it may not get much wear out of it.  30$ is a lot to pay for a hat but I paid it cause I wanted quality.  I didn't get it
B00CMNXX4I|3|THE JACKET FITS MORE LIKE THE SIZE LARGE THAN THE X-LARGE.  I HAVE THE VEST THAT IS THE MATCH TO THE JACKET AND IT IS SIZE CORRECT. I HAVE TO WARE THE JACKET UNDER THE VEST.
B00KNQXOVI|5|Bought it on lightening deal and can't believe the quality was so high.
B00J8PY8CY|5|love this , fits like what I expected.  I am a size 10 normally, but ordered up in size like it instructed and it fit perfect
B00PLRSAPY|5|Great product!!
B00UNP030Y|5|Very cool harness!
B007Z1FAUW|5|I particularly like the rubber along the bottom preventing them from rolling up...very comfortable.  They are true to size and very comfortable.
B00RVZ0GCY|3|Although the socks tend to slip off at the heel while walking, they are comfortable and I did share a pack with my daughter who has smaller feet and she likes them.
B00RD0RSFK|2|Fit too baggie in the hips and butt.
B000WSH5B2|5|the product cover up my expectations and allows be used with reversibility options that can be used with various combinations of clothing.
B003AU5W5K|5|He would wear these. The fabric is imported from the heavens above and helps improve your run times. No better product out there, you need new glasses? Get these instead, I went from 20/20 to 20/10 vision wearing these. Do you have writer's block? You need these, creativity is dramatically improved while wearing silkies, it has been statistically proven. Having trouble meeting the ladies? Get these, BOOM, problem just solved itself. Well endowed? Why not show it off in these? Not well endowed? Get these, improves endowment immediately. Muscular legs? Let's see all the work you've been putting in. Not so muscular legs? Get them muscular while wearing these. Theres not a G.D. thing these shorts can't do. Whether its working out or just working, theres nothing better to be working in these shorts. They fit perfectly for comfort and and agility. Shove democracy down the throats of other nations while wearing silkies just like you heroes in the armed forces of these great United States. Scream freedom with out saying a word while wearing Soffe Men's Runniing Shorts.<br />Results may vary
B0018OXO6Y|5|The Levi's I got fit perfect, I love them! I would definitely buy them here again when the price is right.
B00BRAY10C|1|material is cheap and didn't wash well. it became very pilly and the studs fell off very quickly
B00AEMBQQ6|3|length was fine, definitely would require a belt to stay up.
B002PKZ1HU|3|Made of foamy material. Good for a one time use.
B00JKKWIGA|2|I originally purchased a size medium which was way too small. I ordered the XXL based on size chart and it's somewhat large. Not sure what size I need.
B00JWNHTI2|5|Comfortable
B00VSQTZ1U|5|This product meets all expectations that I needed.<br />I like the state as arrival at their destination. Brand new.<br />I highly recommend this product for its excellent quality.<br />Enjoy big, very sexy clothes.
B00H4VBNR2|5|Theses came in very fast and they fit good. But they are see though but not too too bad. And I thought that they where going to be a little to small but they fit perfect!  So I love them cant wait to order the guy bear and the duck!
B000MWYBZ6|5|I love this bra.  It fit as expected and very comfortable.  Great value compared to local stores.  Will be buying more.<br /><br />Lu
B0045UZ2KO|5|I bought this item for my boyfriend for our 2 year anniversary. He LOVED it! Great quality and design. I would really recomend this item to everyone.
B009ERUYD8|4|I went up a few sizes after reading the other reviews. No threads were showing or loose. Really cute top and fits perfectly.
B00E4XQM92|4|What can I say?  They fit, they keep my legs warm.  The only negative is that they seem to 'pill' very easily.
B00OUWP036|1|Not happy at all.. very cheap plastic case . Artwork will not last long. Very difficult to get off of phone if you need too..<br />Hoping for refund.
B002X0A02S|2|These are much thinner than I expected, and one of them came snagged.
B00JC4IAK2|5|I love my jacket. it fits perfect and keeps me warm while I work. it has plenty of pockets for storage, and the sleeve cuffs are awesome for keeping the sleeves out of my way while I work. the seller was excellent to deal with when I asked them to expedite my order. I would definitely recommend this jacket and the seller to anyone who is looking for a good jacket.
B000A38CJS|5|Nice and warm - these and the same Wranglers in brown are almost all I wear in the winter.  The thinsulate lining is sort of a short-pile fleece, fairly windproof and warm.  Although they're thicker than regular jeans, the cut is such that they don't really look  like lined pants, and in fact I have worn them under my BDU's to stay warm on cold duty nights.  They're &#34;relaxed fit&#34; and I always wear &#34;classic fit&#34; because I don't need extra room, but with the lining they're just right.  I do wish they weren't stonewashed.  I like to keep my pants clean and prefer to start with unwashed jeans so they last a little longer and don't get that bleached-out look that I once loved, but now don't like.  I realize that washed-out is fashionable and I'm just out of sync with it.  Wranglers are my brand, and all I wear.  These are great.  Highly recommended.
B00EP5SIXW|5|Shirt looks great.  Got it for my wife for a Christmas present, she screamed like a little kid.  Apparently she liked it!
B00NO3QE2S|5|I absolutely loved this dress!!! It fits true to size and for me to be 6'2&#34; , it was truly long enough for me. I wore this for a photo shoot and I got the results that I was looking for. Even though it's a tad thin, it is still gorgeous.
B0096Q6P9E|5|This is a great buy. My daughter loves it. Is nice and the material is good. I will definitely recommend it.
B002HT2OBU|5|This Petticoat did exactly what I expected for my outfit. I loved it! I would recommend. It fits perfectly and its comfortable. You would not be disappointed.
B002C1AZTG|4|Good not only for sports but  for every day use
B00LU1YL2G|5|My nephew loves his socks!!!
B00USBP4RU|5|👌🏻👌🏻
B00H9TLQ9Y|5|This jacket was perfect for my 9 year old in New England winter.  She is never cold and I think the color is fantastic.
B00S16WZBC|5|Daughter loves it! I got it for under ten bucks, on sale. Might buy more. Hard to go wrong at that price.
B008ARIR0U|5|Being my first Irish style cap, I really wasn't sure what to expect.  The cap looks better than the photo.  I have a big noggin (7 5/8) and with the additional stretch in the back, I have at least another quarter of an inch.  Looks great, fits great!  I'm very satisfied overall.
B00DVI97T8|5|Daughter wears them all the time, fits perfectly.
B0052W0U5G|5|Very nice leotard.  Fits as expected.
B00F4ILRKU|3|They color of the dress is very pretty and the dress fits true to size and is very flattering. The trim in the center seems a little on the less quality side but overall very nice dress.
B00CRMM51G|5|So far, using this belt, my pants stay up 100% of the time. Much better than without the belt. Looks great too.
B00T73DFS0|2|material is too thick, does not look 100% like the picture.
B007X4BZM8|5|Got this for my father that is a nursing home. He really likes this, nice and warm... wears it all the time
B000LCDJ4G|4|If you're thinking of getting this item because of its \\"package\\" rest assure that I was in the same boat and I end up not using most of the things it came with. The silicone case is nice and pretty durable and goes well with the White Zune. The belt clip is pretty average, as is the armband. The LCD protector is a nusiance once it gets dirty (ie. stuck on cotton or what have you) and that in turn, messes up the original screen so I dont even use the LCD anymore. The stand, as the other person mentioned is indeed pretty weak and is annoying to keep it standing!
B00LQKZEDG|4|Ordered this jacket in a size medium, I'm 5'4&#34; and 130lbs. It was delivered quickly and once I tried it on, I was slightly confused by the size. It ran a bit large, but not terribly. Snapping all the buttons and zipping it up looks how it looks on the model in the picture. The only complaint I have about this jacket is the tabs that come with the detachable hood; when you have the hood on your head the tabs to close the hood around you (and look like a human marshmallow) stick out if they aren't being used, which can look a bit annoying. Overall I'm confident this jacket will keep me warm.
B00OTD2TL2|5|Great top fits and feels nice. Great buy!
B00PV6VXXG|4|My daughter loved it but it was tight. She wore it anyway for the MS walk! Thank you
B001HDG60C|5|Bought this for my granddaughter and she absolutely loved it! She wears it to school on chilly days(there have been lots of them in NY lately).
B002K6F7IW|4|Bought a couple of these for my wife and ended up getting a couple more. Makes breastfeeding the little one much easier. I can't really recommend personally, but the wife gives them a thumbs up.
B000SKP6HO|5|Good fit. Reinforced toe and heel stay put, the cuchion sole is great for standing for long periods. Will buy again
B006K0J60E|4|Good product as expected.
B003NX8CKG|5|I love everything about this jacket!  It fits extremely well, is light weight and comfortably warm for those cool days or nights.
B005LLKFQW|3|The flowing look you might want is not to be gained from this, but it was a good starting point for which I doubled the fabric to in order to get the look we wanted.  That being said, the face part is really neat - you can see out.
B008N813UW|2|I am 5' 2 or so and these are a bit too long. They go over my knee. The foot fit fine. I was disappointed because the sock did look nice.
B00JAI7H1I|5|I ORDERED A COUPLE LAST YEAR FOR A BEAH COVERUP INITIALLY. FOR THE TOTAL PRICE OF $10 , i was very<br />SURPRISED AT THE VERY GOOD QUALITY AND ENDED UP ORDERING 3 MORE. I WORE THEM WHENEVER I WAS HOME AROUND<br />THE HOUSE. I WOULD WASH THEM AND WAS SHOCKED THEY LASTED. I JUST ORDERED SEVERAL FOR THIS CALIFORNIA<br />WEATHER. I AM TALL SO I ORDERED UP A SIZE THOUGH THEY ARE TRUE TO SIZE. IF I WERE A YOUNG WOMEN I BELIEVE<br />I WOULD WEAR THEM WHEN I GO OUT. REMEMBER THIS IS A CASUAL CUTE SUNDRESS AND NOT MEANT FOR A DRESS UP<br />EVENT. THIS DRESS IS FAR MORE COMFORTABLE THAN A TEE SHIRT AND CAPRI. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST DEALS ON<br />AMAZON
B00NC2E1FI|5|This night gown is very comfortable to sleep in. Slides right into bed. Does not tug but stretches very comfortably. It is soft but not &#34;filmy&#34;. Stretches but bounces back to original shape. I like the V neck, no choaking feeling.  Keeps me cool and dry (reason why I purchased it)<br />Buy it! You won't be disappointed. I will be purchasing more
B00LGCDQFW|5|Fits great shipped fast
B00EC5Y8ES|4|I love the idea but not the color
B0094B0XTO|5|True to size! Love the cut
5555012349|5|Fabulous!!
B00ACIGM98|5|Excellent quality and fit.  Unbeatable value and price.  We have bought these several times and continue to be pleased with this product.
B00HUDMBES|5|This is a quality beret for the money. Hard to believe they can sell such a nice beret for such a low price. I wore one of these berets during the Vietnam Era and it is hard to see the difference between the two. A little breaking in and it will feel like my old one. Thanks
B009ZMMWE6|5|Love this for shopping trips. I can hook my keys & wrist strap to it & remove the need to lug around my big purse.
B000IN572U|4|bought the flexeer womens firm control unitard for my daughter who was attending a Regeimental Ball at the  university see attends. It made her feel comfortable and but together in a gown after wearing uniforms for the past 3 months. It washed well also.
B00GFU69P4|2|I have a long waist.  So it didn't fit right.  Other than that I looked great.  It would be perfect for a shorter person
B001F51XW8|5|I bought this coat in Dec 08 and absolutely love it.  I'm 5'6\\" with a shapely (12-14) hour glass figure and have a tough time finding something that falls at just the right length (upper mid-thigh).  The red accents on the coat, princess cut and just right length gives a visual weight loss.  I have received many complements.  Sizes are true, I ordered a 14 & it fits perfectly even with a light-weight sweater.  Warm enough for those cold New England nights.
B00ND73AW2|5|Good price.
B00J32YCZA|5|The delivery came early it beat the 2 week estimate and its function<br />for a fridge magnet is pretty good. I would not try it as a bottle opener<br />too light weight of a metal. But anyways I am using it for my Led Zep<br />Collection for all of their great songs and concerts. Thank you
B003ZYDTG0|3|Very well made just a bit smaller than store bought bra's of same size.
B004UR5O4G|5|Exactly what I was looking for.
B008TZWRJ0|4|Love Walking Dead
B006W1UMA4|3|this is a very nice dress for warm evenings but the dress is very sheer and a bit snug so consider ordering a size larger then your normal size if you have a large bust
B00LMI9A6Y|3|Im 5'11&#34; & these are too short, hitting 2&#34; above my ankle :( otherwise comfy and satisfactory.
B00JQT01YQ|5|Fit well,  nice quality
B00BRUU56G|2|dress was not as expected. looked very cheep. not good quality. i returned item for a refund. not happy at all.
B009KM5GTY|1|This dress is a great dress but it wast not professionally made.  I believe it was locally made without putting the interest of the customers in mind.  perfectly nice.  It look different from what it was physically.
B00N5FWHW6|5|I like this product to much thanks.
B004TUJO8G|5|I love this wig. The color is great and the wig is made of the high quality Japanese synthetic fibers. I would definitely recommend this seller and product.
B001H0F6DS|3|feels really good, very comfortable, i like the style, shipped fast<br />great colors variety of options are available too<br />strongly recommend it
B0038AB4M2|3|this is a great workout bra but the bottom edge is very rough elastic that is a little irritating, putting it on is quite a workout and you have to be able to reach and hook the clasps behind.  not sure I would purchase this again.
B0128SHP5O|5|Love love love this dress. It's flattering and is actually long enough even with my bump.
B00TQRABY8|5|great
B00B9FJHEA|3|good
B00QIKVPFK|5|Great fit.  I love the touch of yellow.
B004UIYVGW|5|I love this body bag, it is super stylish and I really love the owl.  I am happy with everything about it!
B00ID5NNCG|4|This is a great swimming suit... Just wish they indicate the actual size by number since the small turned out too large for my 2 year old....I will still keep it since it was a good deal.
B00IOXCA9E|5|Bought it for my daughter. She loves it.
B0047EXR64|3|44&#34; waist & XL was way to small I ordered XXL but I have my doubts by we will see
B00EH8MQU8|5|Love it
B007W0WQ5S|2|The information engraved on the belt say it has 1 side genuine leather, the other side is not. Cheaply made, the length is short for the size 34.
B001FTQLPS|1|Suit is about as cheap as it gets. The material is extremely thin and will rip quite easily. I bought this to parody the enigma known as FatMan on YouTube so I have done cut all the sumo gear off, modified and ruined it anyway. It works for what I need it for, but I can't help but notice how horribly cheap and overpriced it is if someone was seriously purchasing this.     Now sellers sure have the right to price it at whatever they wish... but this isn't a collectible. In the area of costumes, the high price does lead one to believe this is of \\"quality\\". Yeah right.    I can already see the thing getting a huge tear in the near future just by putting it on. If you aren't small enough to easily fit into it you're going to rip the thing just by suiting up. You have to get into it very carefully. Shouldn't have to be that cautious for the price this retails at.    I have never seen this for less than the $30-$40 range. It's true value is about $3-$4.00.
B00PJJTLFM|5|Awesome :)
B002AQRPT6|5|I usually buy the Nordstrom smart care 35x34 for him, I got the 34x34 and they fit great, heavier material, good for fall and winter, but will work in warmer months.  So far after about 10 washes they are holding up great, color is not fading, no pocket wallet rips, pocket seams are holding well. I like the flat front, more modern for an early thirties working man!  Great price for the quality.
B0007YR9KS|5|They are very comfortable and fit very well indeed. Nice construction and comfortable shoulder straps.  Very nice to wear. Wow.
B003X26SAS|4|Good
B00HHOXWUM|3|It's good
B00M0AYFPY|5|Bought for my 89 yr old mother. She wears a size 5 shoe & they still fit very well. Washed great. I hang to dry. Will be ordering more.
B005I34BZE|3|Palms are water proof but back of hands isn't, when wet my hands get cold. OK if not too cold out.
B00EVIA0J8|5|They are extremely comfortable！They fit great and my husband loves them very much! He will only choose this brand in the future!
B005EWGHFG|5|loved it
B00H9KAY4Q|4|I read the reviews before hand so I ordered a size down from the measurements. It fit perfect! This suit is so flattering! If you are smaller than a C/B cup though you may have difficulty with the top. This is probably the best cut suit I have ever had. I will definitely go for other colors and patterns in the future since I feel so good in this one.
B00KU0VL4Y|3|First off, I want to say that I love this bikini. It's so cute and fun, and I just love lace!<br /><br />However, I had to drop the rating down because the bottoms just don't fit. I know I'm not the average woman when it comes to hip size, but damn, these bottoms made me feel like a fatty.<br />My normal bottom size is medium, sometimes large. (My hips are like 38) So I ordered both at the same time, and figured I would send back the one that doesn't fit. Nope. They were the exact same measurements. The only difference was the size of the cloth that covers your butt (it was a tiny bit bigger in the large size). So, sadly, I started a return order on them. But because I love the top so much, and the design of the bottoms, I ordered an XL in bottoms. They are not even a fraction bigger!! They look a tiny bit better, but I just can't go around in a swimsuit that looks like it's cutting into my hips.<br />They are comfortable enough, don't get me wrong, but the lace should stretch more and they need to increase the hip band when increasing the size of the bikini, not just the cloth over the butt. I mean, that's ridiculous. I feel like if I stand in a certain position, it will look just fine on me, but sitting down the lace will definitely roll up and cut more into my hips. And I don't even mind the fact that the bottoms don't cover my butt, hell I think that looks good! Lol.<br /><br />Ugh, I'm just so saddened by this. I really want this bikini. But the sizing just doesn't work for me. If you're smaller or if you work out enough to where your hips are lean, then this will probably look great on you! But for someone like me who is in good shape, but still has some squishiness, it will not work. In my photos, I'm standing just right to make it look the best that it can.
B00BBRXZJ4|5|I read reviews & bought size up- wasn't necessary- colors are nice, love material
B0031YO54Y|5|When I wear this tie, people really enjoy it.  Of course, it has a special meaning for me ;). Great!
B008CGQR4C|5|Arms are a little long...but still a great ROBE
B003OA4FTU|5|Great niece loves them!
B00FRIHC06|4|Snug fit but cute
B00KWODZ2O|5|Great jacket.  Love the liner vest that can come out and work as a lighter jacket when needed.  Good quality produce and am very happy with it!
B00G4BPRZC|3|I LOVE this bra. I have bought this bra for a few years, and love the fit and the very comfortable shoulder straps.  Sadly, the plastic front clasp breaks far too soon (within just a couple of months every time in the plum color - lasts a little longer in the beige or white), and if the clasp does last as long as three or four months, the underwire works its way through.  The result is that while I do love the bra and keep purchasing it over and over, the quality of the workmanship is definitely not worth the price I pay.<br /><br />I continue to purchase this same bra exclusively because of the fit and comfort, however if anyone else were to manufacturer the same style using better quality clasps and underwire control, I would change.
B00BR03MI4|5|Love them
B00DIH6LX2|5|I love this headscarf ! I am going through chemo and my hair is gone. They are comfy and stylish, and for the price you can't beat them. I bought one at my hospital gift shop for $40.00 ! I bought more of these recently and wil keep buying more ! Thank you for having such great prices!
B0054N2YH0|5|nice product, the collors are nice and i really enjoy. hight quality product. not so cheap but i love it.
B00K75FL84|2|I am average sized, and sometimes I can even where petite size dresses.  The middle section with the belt rides so high that it was too uncomfortable to where.  Such a shame because it was very cute.  Also the material seemed like Halloween costume quality.
B00KFX1R9A|5|I needed this! This was exactly what I needed for my Cosplay outfit and was delivered exactly when it was expected. Thanks soo much! It fits awesome too! :D
B0053XF996|4|I bought this hoping to help get rid of some baby fat that doesnt want to go anywere after my two kids. This has turned out much better than I thought it would be considering it is so much cheeper than other body binders. It fits well and I am not a small person, I am a size 10 (I ordered a L) and I have thick thighs and a large but. This does not dig into my legs like many others I have tried alothough it does roll up on my inner thighs (but I blame that on my legs). It is not as constricting as some I have tried but it is a pull on so that is to be expected. It wears nice and doesn't roll down around my waist. There are no buldges anywere and it shapes nicely but this is not for someone who wants to instantly look sizes smaller (I just wanted to be able to button my pants after having my son). It does take some wiggeling and dancing to get into and when you have to go to the bathroom it takes some effort because it is a full panty. After the first day wearing it my back hurt so terribly bad that I had to take pain meds to sleep but in the morning my back felt better than it has in months (if you have had a baby you know what I mean). It has improved my posture and I feel more confident in my clothes. Over all I would recomend this so someone who needs a little help but not for someone who wants a lot of constriction.
B007IVP7LQ|5|I love it. Fits as expected! Perfect shirt for a Whovian and also perfect to confuse people.
B00A7BUF5C|5|Charlie freaking Harper! This shirt fits great, looks great, and positively makes you feel like you are the head honcho!
B00AHTJYM4|4|Has flexible cups so that you look like you actually have boobs, but it is also comfortable and gives good support.
B00LHH9OAM|5|i got this for my girlfriend and it fit her perfectly she really likes them a lot
B00KRODNSU|5|This hoodie is probably the most favored of all hoodies I have ever bought for my daughter.  Its very very soft, very warm, built extremely well, great price, doesn't shrink when washed, and fits exactly how its stated by tag sizing. I wish all hoodies were built like this one is. I wouldn't waste so much money on other ones that fall apart so quickly. I highly recommend this product.
B00FJ1DR3M|5|Very light and fit true to size. Very feminine and sexy and extremely comfortable. Just love the comfortable fit and great look!!!
B00KPP63EW|1|SOOOOOOO unflattering
B0049APCV4|5|Happy with the purchase, good quality, print stays after washing/drying and didn't shrink much at all. My bf gets compliments on it all the time.
B002Z0ZIO6|5|It was perfect just what I needed for a wedding my son w<br />As the ring barer  it fit well and he loves it
B00NM9CX9C|4|I only wish it came in more color options but this is a high end baby sleeper.  They zipper is great quality.  The feet are the right size. The shoulders are nice and wide so you don't have to struggle to get their arms in.  The hand holes are the right size.  The only reason I took a star off is because our daughter is the average size of a six month old and it fits her perfectly right now. So if I didn't try it on her early I may not have known it fit her.  But I did and right now it's our favorite outfit.  She is a little small for Hanna Anderson 70s but too big for most 6 month clothing. I've found most baby clothes are sized too small.  You should just buy one size up always.
B00AJI0SA0|5|I bought this for an afternoon wedding,and got lots of compliments. Now it is my fun, flowing, flouncy go-to dress for semi-casual afternoon and evening get togethers.<br /><br />The colors are very bright, it will call call attention to yourself. It has a built-in tulle petticoat which holds the skirt's shape beautifully.  The deconstructed seams - no hemming, raveling at neck, arms and hem - make this more casual than it appears in the photo.
B00STV36WG|5|This was EXACTLY as I had hoped it would be! Great service and great customer service!
B003552IEI|5|This tape is incredible! No matter how saggy, tight, or obvious you think a wardrobe malfunction is, this tape can handle it, even through dancing. I have some in my purse because I'm prone to these malfunctions, and it is just a miracle!
B0066N79P4|5|light, fits well - I bought a medium, am 5'10&#34; 165 and fit.  Love them, can't beat them for the price.
B00F3SJQ72|5|I have nothing else to say but GREAT! The stitches were very well coordinated. The material is never cheap looking even after couple of washes. Fits fine with my body structure.
B00F64QLGM|4|I bought this for my wife and when she puts it on..... Damn is the only thing I can say. Wonderful!!
B00HJ1PU80|4|My daughter loves it.  Nice quality flan.
B005HS5GVS|5|too cute!!  I love the expression on the deer's face.  I've had lots of compliments and bought two more as gifts.  Both gifts were well received and their new owners love them.  Some people have commented on durability but hey for the price I think these will out last some of the more pricey ones I've had over the years.
B007FCF2KY|5|Very sturdy and good material. You can tell you got a bargain! I wear it daily and will purchase another one as soon as my size comes back in stock.
B00CLZ3FHC|3|It's kind of goofy and fits weird. It looks different in every photograph and the suit itself is just a little goofy. This is definitely best for someone who is at least 5'8 and only 120 pounds.
B00007AUXA|1|I bought this case to carry my laptop during my pregnancy.  Although it holds a lot of items, the case is built so that it falls forward all the time.  It cannot stand upright, even when the computer is loaded in the back.  The bag is badly balanced.  I got really annoyed with it and finally threw it away.
B00KU82EYM|5|I'm sure my granddaughter will love this dress.  She is so into dresses and this is beautifully made.
B00HFDSMIC|5|This is the cutest sweatsuit!!! It fits perfect since I like mine a little Baggie. Also, the quality far exceeded my expectation! This is going to last a very long time! I just wish it was available in more colors besides gray.
B007IW0C10|3|I wish they sold packages with only one color.  I just wanted black, but was stuck w/ red and green.  About a year later, a few pairs are ripping at the seam on the hip.
B002XIRHHQ|4|Great  bargain.
B00PI5GPCY|5|These fit perfect for my athletic built, 15year old son!!
B00KSNNKXI|5|Beautiful with jeans or slacks
B00OLI9TY0|5|Looked great on my 13yo daughter and looked age appropriate
B009PSXAPU|4|Makes me feel like a pirate when I buy things.
B0093KUN50|5|Fits and looks great, just needed to make the initial adjustment to get it to fit me. I love it and will do business with them again.
B00C2L7EWM|5|After several washes still fit nice and look great
B00I64162I|3|I was hoping the sweatshirt was indicative of the picture's color, but it is a hunter's vest orange.
B00VF5PD60|2|Ended up being very bright, like neon. I gave it to my 20 year old daughter and she likes it.
B005PKOY4S|5|Is beautifor close an very good price I reconmend, Is beautifor close an very good price I reconmend very very good
B000A3I3OM|3|Excellent quality. It was a littler oversized but I was satisfied with this purchase.
B00MNNJFVC|4|I got this hoodie for a festival camping trip and it is perfect. The fit is a little weird though, I'm a small but wanted something a little loose so I got the medium. The sleeves are way large, the neck and waist band part are tight. Regardless, this is the best hoodie ever. It's so comfortable and kept me warm on those cold camping nights. I washed it once and it still looks vibrant and I think it shrunk in all the right places. I'll be ordering again from here defiantly
B00512G86M|5|I love this top. It's beautiful!
B000N8RXA4|3|I bought two of these and two of the black ones and these are by far shorter in length then the black ones. I may only get a few warnings out of them before giving them to goodwill. Quality is fine, just short.
B00F59HJL4|4|Super cute!
B00A7Y4ROO|4|My wife would like them even better is they were no-iron!!!!
B00EG0KTME|1|like other waist cincher I bought 2XL has always been my measurement I wonder how  this one can't fit.. the seller should have stated that its for slim people instead of making me waste my money.
B003ZYDS98|1|There is no support in this bra. I was looking for something that would be supportive, but with no underwires it just didn't work. I returned it.
B00DNNPOP2|5|Best sun hat I have ever wore!<br />Comfortable and wide enough rim!
B000RFP1KM|5|I ordered 3 black ones for my sister, my sister-in-law and myself.  First you open the package and the smell is just like my cedar chest...in a good way.  They are packaged nicely with tags saying they are %100 cashmere wool.  They are very warm, (I wore it on THanksgiving in Michigan.) and the more you wear it the softer it gets.  I really want another one now.
B00M6XA0VS|4|Its cute.  Size run a little big.  Its more of T top, but that is fine.
B00B5FCCKK|5|I am a poor college student and don't exactly have money to splurge on fancy swimsuits, but the stress of finals made me crack and I went online shopping and bought these swim bottoms! I absolutely love them! I am a size 8(U.S) and feel just out of the range of looking hot in a 2 piece swimsuit, but now I believe again. The fit is so flattering it literally gets ride of all signs of love handles. The print is gorgeous and the style is very fashionable. The coverage is perfect for someone like me who isn't looking to show off everything I've got! Seafolly is my new favorite company! I will definitely be saving up to buy my next swimsuit from them. I bought the matching bandeau top too and feel like a super star when I wear them!
B00H1QZV6Y|5|I really love this shrug, so simple and cute
B00FYEY256|5|Love it! Great quality!
B00LIUTJIK|3|Cute cut and had potential. Unfortunately it is made of Cheap itchy material. Sent it back.
B00PHKYDD8|5|These shorts are amazing!! I am normally a size 0 or 1 but I listened to the reviews to order a size up. I got a 3 and they fit perfect! And the color on the pockets is prefect! Definitely worth the buy!
B007R72A7A|4|very good product.....
B00BTPXCL4|4|These boots are adorable and durable. Heeding warnings about running large, I bought a size down (son is an 8, got a 7) and I'd say we could have managed with a 5. The sizing on Amazon is bizarre so I went off the Hatley site, which seemed pretty standard. He still wears them, and I'm grateful at least that he'll grow into them!!
B005SN3I62|5|nice but I bought it for my granddaughter and she thinks its too old fashioned to wear.
B00BMVZ2FE|5|awesome - and amazing customer service
B00A76MTEC|1|Bought this and will immediately be giving it away. Wasted money.  It looks and fits nothing like the picture. DO NOT BUY
B00VEM9SAQ|5|Very comfy and fits perfectly.
B00BIOYMME|4|Beautiful
B00858U522|1|The belt is nice, nothing out of the ordinary, but a nice touch over longer sweaters or knit dresses. However, it's way too small. I wear a size 8 and I can barely wear it, it's pretty tight and I hooked it up at the last link of the metal chain. It looks like it was made for teenagers, not adults. I will return it.
B00KLOKKHS|5|These are a great fit! They stretch well and the zippers don't bother me at all. I hvent washed them yet so we will see how they wash.
B00XMLGW4M|5|Nice fit. As described it is packable, so it means it is very light and compressible.
B005DA57L4|5|Nice
B00ALNPY6Q|5|Its so pretty, colorful. My daughter just turned 2 years old and it fits her like I was expecting. Not to small not to big! Just great. Very beautiful outfit!
B00H8IAAES|5|My 15 yr old son loves the Diamond Supply line, but for the prices they expect at the malls for these hoodies.  The price was perfect for the wallet and he is happy with his Xmas gift.
B008X6DQD6|5|I love this sweater! I recently bought it for a very importent night that i recently had. I was having my new boyfriend over for dinner one evening so he and my parents could meet. I wanted something that was somewhat dressy but was comfortable. this sweater was perfect for the occasion. It Im a more muscular guy so i went with the XL and it fit great! Very soft and I looked and felt great in it. My boyfriend was giving me compliments all night long. One thing I will say. The sweater is a bit darker in color in person than it is in the picture but i was not disappointed by that at all. It is a beautiful sweater, very soft and comfy yet still very fashionable!
B00FY7VU6C|4|I'm a size 8, and ordered a medium -- good thing, as a small would have probably cut off circulation.  As it is, I would not be comfortable wearing this to the office unless I have a jacket or sweater to distract from the significant hugging action.  On the other side, it's surprisingly comfortable and it's a nice weight of material.  If you're comfortable emphasizing your shape, then you'll like it.
B004Z5HGWG|4|My husband received this robe for Christmas 2012.  He's happy with its fit, and the feel of its material is comfy.
B00QEUL80Q|4|nice quality
B001GIPD02|5|These are good quality socks.  Our daughter wears them all the time (usually in contrasting colors).  So they've had a lot of wear, and are holding out just fine.  She loves them, so we let her put them on, even though they're really quite small now.    Note for gift givers: a lot of new parents get way too many clothes as gifts.  Consider aiming a bit higher in age than the child.
B00JXJQ4NQ|3|The color wasn't like the picture but it's alright
B00ED396K0|5|loved this shirt<br />great fit and very nice shirt
B00FY2VJ5Y|4|I like the warmth,quality and value
B00D402CKE|5|Fits my 3 month old perfectly.
B005TS49PA|5|This is a stunning top. The pattern is even better than the picture. But it does run slightly small. I got the 16 because I had been warned about this, and its closer to a 14. But still fits well, and is a very flattering fit. It doest seem to ride up as some tops do. I wear bather tops with board shorts and this style is perfect.
B00ZEBW7WE|2|Two stars for everything that is wrong for this item. I'm a man with an average sized head. This cap is described as &#34;one size fits most&#34; but that couldn't be farther from the truth. If this had an actual size it would be equivalent to an XL. Sure, if you want to look silly you can pull the sizing strap beyond where it is designed to go but that's not how anyone would want to wear this. Do not buy this unless you have a large head and have trouble finding hats that fit. If this describes you then you are the kind of person who can wear this cap.<br /><br />The caps are shipped fairly flat so you should expect to receive an imperfect cap. I can push some of the wrinkles out but it has permanent creases that will never go away.<br /><br />I got these for $2 during a promotion and it is $2 wasted. I will never wear them and I would not buy them again. I am going to request a refund but since these ship from China I have no idea if I'll have any luck getting the situation resolved.<br /><br />In case you are wondering, they are adjustable by a velcro strap. I was wondering about this since it isn't mentioned in the product description and there is no photo of the back of the cap.<br /><br />I am giving this two stars because one star reviews have to be reserved for exceptionally bad products that miserably fail. This is a decent budget baseball cap but describing it as &#34;one size fits most&#34; is inaccurate.
B0051HFHMI|4|They fit a bit looser than the previous ones I ve purchased in the same brand. Overall decent quality. I don't particularly care for the bright colors but that's preference.
B002YF269M|5|Fit perfectly! Ordered it for my mom and it fit her like a glove. I actually ordered one more for her
B00FZR1CIW|4|Perhaps I should have read the information better. Was not happy with the fit. Was pleased with the quality and so was able to pass them on to a family member, father than the hassle of sending them back.
B00US1KL6O|5|Perfect for working out! Soft with a &#34;worn in&#34; look and feel, and the right amount of length so my midsection isn't making multiple appearances at the gym.
B006ZU6PW6|2|i don't like it,it don't look good on me,,but i like the cloth,is so soft and comfortable,,in fairness its a good quality,,
B00YC4CRBA|4|Great  yellow color, quality material. Order 1-2 sizes larger (Asian sizing).
B002IRKKJ4|5|Super cute and perfect!!
B004IOXHSG|3|I'm 5&#34;4, 125 pounds, and found them a little baggy and in need of regular adjustment. They seem to be constructed in a crude way, the legs/feet like tubes with no turned heel, the upper part also tube like, same on front and back which is odd since in the back we have a protuberance we do not have in the front, to use delicate language. However, they are very warm and cozy and feel good on, despite the regular adjustments you have to do, and they are reasonably priced.
B00M2URM1Q|5|is very nice
B000GX31DO|5|Another swell Native American themed Mountain T-shirt! I wear these to honor our Native Americans!
B005UY06FK|5|I'm 6'4&#34;, average/slim build, got a large-- this is my favorite shirt. Perfect length, V-neck isn't too deep, sleeves are ideal length, super comfortable. I just wish it was available in more colors.
B00F9SPS14|5|Love this sweater, bought as a gift for my daughter, and she loves it, it is so soft, and comfortable! it is so fuzzy!!! i do wish larger sizes were available, i would like one too.
B00HZD6E3C|3|Very cute for baby pictures
B00F9W84Q6|5|I love this costume. It is made well and does not seem &#34;cheap&#34;. The fit is perfect and it was great for Halloween!
B0043RJQ8I|5|The shirt is gorgeous!  I read that it ran a little small and so ordered a large and it fits.  The pictures actually don't do it justice- the graphics have a cool grafiti look to them, the fabric is nice and it fits like most fitted Junior T-shirts.
B007EKOSS4|5|good quality
B00SJZUVPW|5|I feel fantasic in it!
B0002TOZ00|5|Delivered on time and the socks fit fine.
B00B1P3XQG|4|I'm a recent convert to Amazon for purchasing men's slacks for work.  Can't find my size in the stores. Of course, the real answer is for me to lose some weight, and then fit into something smaller.<br /><br />Lacking the will power, fortitude or whatever, I took the easier path and ordered these (and some others), which I wear to work.  Good fit, good quality and I'm pleased overall.  I am familiar with Savane as they are often sold in Stein Mart, but not in this size so I was glad to find them online.  I'll for sure buy again (regardless of my waist size :-)
B00KQ3AKJW|5|love it!
B0068MA72K|5|For a proper fit order a size smaller as suggested by Wool Overs.  Nothing beats 100% wool to fight the cold.  The zip collar is great,  no scarf needed except on the windy colder days.
B008R6P3UQ|5|Dockers have been a &#34;go to&#34; brand for me because of the fit.  I never need to adjust the length and the sizing seems to be consistent.
B00UU2XS20|5|Exactly what I was hoping they would be
B00NTUZZJE|2|I am not a fan of how this style looks on me. it is way too big, even tho I ordered two sizes smaller, based on customer reviews. It is not flattering at all. looks cheap, but it is comfortable and the fabric is pretty. I like it for wearing around the house. I will NOT be wearing it in public. Makes me look like an overstuff pillow with a belt. NOT flattering for my body at all.
B005LLK3PK|3|Hey for the price i&#34;m not complaining.  But pieces were falling off of it within an hour.  There are some pieces that are glued on and they won't last for long.  The rest of it stayed together fine.  It did not fit at all couture to the head as shown.  So my daughter was sort of a cone head Cleopatra.  But it all good, just getting through one more dress up theme day at school without paying a fortune.  Thats all this mama cares about.
B00JU5NSLY|4|Fit just as it should.  Great color!
B00MXEC8MY|5|its really cute in person
B00M78VHFA|5|The best fitting T-Shirt ever.My husband is 6' 5&#34; and is very slim.The fabrics is light and soft.Breaths well as we live in a tropical environment and it is 85degrees in mid April.If your specs are similar you would be making a Big mistake not trying this t-shirt!Thanks again Amazon for another great product!
B00DD0CE0I|5|Love these socks
B004Q0PMMG|5|It is what I expected - a nice-looking quality shirt! You just can't beat a good-looking boxer on a shirt!
B00LGEPV6M|5|This is a great suit for the price. very well made. Bought because it said 4-5 months however it came and was a 4-5T Had to send back. However would buy this again when my daughter is older.
B00N1RG1ZC|5|Great Quality
B008QXUPSK|5|The pants were longer than anticipated but was not an issue.  We had them hemmed so my wife could wear them around the house without shoes.  However, they look good enough to wear out.<br /><br />I personally love these!!  They look amazing!
B00GDFLV04|5|I love these pants dude. They are the bomb-digity. I feel like a woodland goddess, they give me infinite awesomeness. Everyone should have at least 6 pairs.
B00CWMRYSA|5|My hubs is a big man and this shirt fits him comfortably and perfectly. I love that these are made in the USA. He loves this shirt.
B00EEJZOY0|5|I have been a collector for a few years. This is one of my favorites. Her clothing is unique and well crafted.
B005DD9FVY|5|nice  t shirt...I purchase  3 different color from same t shirt. perfect fit. If you are M go for L<br />Thanks
B00NUAY58A|4|I bought a double pack of fleece leggings in charcoal and olive.<br /><br />I am 5'3&#34; and about 115 and they fit really nicely - form fitting without being too tight or unflattering, but there's still a lot of stretch in them so they can definitely span a bigger size range. I think they might be too loose on anyone significantly smaller than I am though.<br /><br />With the fleece lining, these are thick enough to wear as pants which is awesome.<br /><br />My only complain is that the olive is definitely NOT true to the photo image. It's much less obviously green, almost like a khaki color. Certainly not a deal breaker for me because it's still a decent earth tone color which I like...but it's worth noting if you're hoping for an exact color match. I'd be curious about how other colors hold up....
B001RZF5BG|5|If I could give it 10 stars, I would! It is a gorgeous, functional wallet with more pockets than I could ever want.  Absolutely LOVE IT!  This is my second Anuschka purchase (I own a handbag too) and I always get compliments on them. Beautiful and practical. Buy it!
B00G0AVO1I|3|I would like to wear it but it isn't my size
B005CQSN10|5|I REALLY LIKE THE COMFORT - SATIN PJ'S.  THE COLOR - STYLE- FIT REALLY GOOD.  SATIN PJ'S IS JUST THE WAY TO GO, TY!
B007DKZI4S|5|This is the greatest sports bra ever
B00M2OXBUS|4|very long and a little big...but my daughter loves it.
B007IDMW12|5|This shirt is definitely a slightly smaller version of a large. I love it since large doesn't fit me as well, nor does a medium. Juuuuuuust right!
B0031U0OPM|5|I bought a cheesy belt ( it said leather) but was more of a pleather, sent it back to Amazon got my money back bought this one and it is truly a solid tough LEATHER BELT. If you work in construction there appears nothing tougher than Carhartt. Great buy
B009UZAE6G|4|I would have given this shrug 5 stars if it were just a little bit thicker. It's on the thin side...however, I do still like it. The material is &#34;fitted&#34; and very soft. The teal and red shrugs are both really pretty colors. The items are exactly as pictured.<br /><br />I'd also like to say to not expect the shrug to fit over your entire chest - it will be one of those &#34;hugging&#34; shrugs.<br /><br />All in all it's a good purchase though, I might be purchasing the yellow next!
B00F2ZNY5G|4|I received the item fast and in fine condition, however, the size is very misleading! May want to rename sizes? I ordered 24 month size, but it will probably fit him through 48 months! It's fine...but he definitely won't be wearing it anytime soon.
B00DB290IC|5|The best bra Bali has made!!
B0018OKO94|4|Same ol' Levi's. Fit like I expected them too, the color is dead on, and they're comfortable. My wife still says they make my ass look flat, but not as bad as the 559s did. I'm just glad she still looks.
B00NBFHMM0|4|Very cute dress but be careful with the sizes. Apparently they are made a little small.
B0077VJZOM|4|It's a nice leather belt. Only belt I could find with my size. I wear a size 29 pants and this belt is perfect for it. Nice looking belt but nothing amazing.
B00JLD5KGG|5|This is an adorable dress/onesie. id definitely recommend it to others.
B003IHU3FO|3|Have brought Calvin Klein Jeans before and was very satisfied with material used and the cut/size. These seem a lot inferior in material used and length was longer than earlier jeans  purchased.Both were 30\\" length but there was quiet a bit of difference.Would hesitate to recommend these particular jeans.
B006IWTFCI|5|Good quality!!
B00AHS9I4Y|5|My wife loves the shirt! It is excellent to wear to the gym or as a casual dress shirt. Great price as well.
B004FKL9VU|5|This bra is extremely comfortable and easy to use.  I have nursed 2 babies before finding this bra for my 3rd. Very easy to latch and unlatch one handed. Even when I was engorged in the beginning there was no pinching or uncomfortable poking. I am a 34 E and the Large really worked well.  Just awesome.
B00L2KKE1M|5|My daughter loves this! It's really great quality! She is 5 1/2, so the size 6 is perfect! Definitely recommend!
B000FV4EE2|3|I bought this bra in a smaller cup size due to me being petite. The backing strap was EXTREMELY tight without any adjustment options, and I didn't feel much support in the front for my breasts. I'd imagine this would be good for the more well endowed, but I didn't have much luck.
B0059DS5P0|1|Disappointed in the fit and quality. Too tight over the chest, too wide over the hip. Material thin and see through. I have several Columbia fleece jackets and this is not the same quality at all.
B002ZJUVEY|1|i measure the scarf and its less than 58\\" even include the knit fingers. far from the discribe.i donnt like it
B00OQW0ZXU|4|it something i would definitely buy again.
B00GBU7X08|5|Love my Levis still after 30 years. These were a bit a size larger than expected though but that's because differing styles of Levis are made in different countries so you really need to try them on before buying.
B004UUED5E|5|I bought this necklace as a Christmas gift for my 25-year-old daughter. She sent me the Amazon link for the necklace (easy to buy things when they send you the exact link!). She loved the unique design and the color of the necklace.
B00KTU4OX0|2|Like the color but the size is too small.
B008UQG66I|4|Love the design and the fabric.  They just run a little big but they have the elastic on the inside so you can adjust the waist.
B007TV3M08|4|Be sure to measure yourself before ordering! With that said, I purchased the shapewear for an event and it fit nicely although the straps were a bit uncomfortable.
B007BLI12K|2|Keep shopping.  This was one of those items that looks WAY better online.  It started falling apart when I took it out of the package.  Definitely won't last for multiple years.
B008TNNGF6|5|cheap and only what you need if you already have a pair of black slacks.
B00AKSD00E|1|I ordered 2 pairs of these. The Navy ones are indeed 100 % cotton; the Granite Heather are 60% cotton despite what it says in the description. Considering that I went looking specifically for 100% cotton, the Granite ones are useless from the beginning. Now, for the idiotic design, common to both pairs, that jumps at you when you see the inside:<br />1. The elastic band sewed at the waist, which is synthetic material, and pretty wide, is completely exposed, instead of being covered with cotton.<br />2. The tag is a large, scratchy piece of material that is sewed over the elastic band at the back.<br />What should have been a pair of very comfortable shorts, was destroyed by some designer who should have not been in the fashion industry ..., or in any industry for that matter.<br />I don't think the price justifies the disastrous design, because I would have refused these even if somebody would have offered them to me for free.
B0012XZ91E|5|For me, this is the only bra I wear.  Fits well and comfortable.
B00E1CR55G|3|a little tight and the material was a little tough
B00KT8J0LS|5|Had to order twice to get the right size,but what the hey.  The false jacket is a little longer than pictured, so you don't get the white center effect.  Get it wrinkled just throw in dryer on low heat.  I'm looking forward to wearing at an up coming wedding.
B004RCSOUU|2|The medium was more like a x-large. If you normally are a medium in maturnity get the small.
B0018317A0|3|I'm very sad to say that the baby fell out within days of me receiving the keychain and I've yet to find it. Superglue the kid in right away.
B00I77PF62|4|nice item
B00LBYSVAA|3|To be L, is very large!
B00D10YQ42|1|It is about size small, but long. Very tight.
B00KWIDSYU|3|Cute shirt! Just wish the material was better quality.
B00N47AUV0|5|Its great!!
B00I1EUNS6|5|My daughter is still about 3-6 months away from wearing it, but I loved it and love the quality, so I kept the dress!  I'm sure it will fit very well!
B00I1AQ316|5|nicer than I thought they would be
B007HPAARY|5|Best socks. Perfect fit & feel. They don't slide down in your shoes and they are not binding around your ankles. I am very happy and I am not even a Diabetic. But I am a nurse and a walker & these are perfect for every day. Thanks, Cherrie
B00K5TAJ9S|4|First of all, a comment on the size and fit. I ordered Large, which is what I normally wear. In this case, it's a little bit longer than I would have expected but otherwise the fit is good (appropriate girth around chest and waist, and good fit in the arms). It's very comfortable, lighter weight than a cotton hoodie, but about as warm. I haven't had need to test out the quick-dry features, but it seems like they should be good. Looks nice - understated, and classic looking. This is my new favorite hoodie, and should work well both for casual wear and moderate activity. The only thing I would change if I could is to shorten the length by a couple of inches and do away with the &#34;Duofold&#34; logo on the right pocket -- but those are minor quibbles with an otherwise great hoodie.
B00NTNGGZ8|5|Love this jacket, so cute and really nice quality. My son loves it too!
B007BLNJS6|5|Exactly as described
B00L21LZQ4|4|i was pretty satisfied
B005SVILLQ|5|So this product I ordered it they shipped it from china.....It took about 2 weeks to get here, it's not bad<br /><br />The hat is awesome, I posted a picture of me wearing it on facebook and I got over 100 likes and a lot of comments:) at first I thought I wasted money on it.<br /><br />To me it turned out to be a good investment:)<br /><br />Any negative things about it is I think the bill is too long, That's just my preference
B00FFIGPVK|1|Not as described at all. Thought the front of the shirt was plain white but it has a cheesy design screen printed on it. Total waste of $20 and ruins the cool design on the back
B00FNN8Q5K|5|I was very hesitant to order swimwear online, but glad I did. I'm 5' 7&#34; 170lbs and these bottoms fit like a glove and flatter my curves. They are well made and arrived much sooner than expected. Very happy with this purchase.
B000NZW3KC|5|our future son in law was thrilled with this t shirt, and it looks good on him
B00JJB7OIC|4|Simple but sexy.
B00EZHVIWS|2|The actual Army Green color was much darker in real life. I sent it back.
B008ODSHRS|5|BEAUTIFFUL, FLATTERS THE FIGURE, MANY COMPLIMENTS, LOOKS PROFESSIONAL, AND FASHIONABLE AT THE SAME TIME. NOT TOO HOT FOR THE SUMMER. I WOULD BUY IS 5 DIFFERENT COLORS!
B00B2L7T0A|5|I don't go for trendy, fad or fashion jeans. These jeans have a comfortable fit, with a waist that sits where it should. They are a classic.
B009CTUG0Y|5|Fantastic shorts! Smartphone pocket is vastly more convenient than I thought it would be. Perfect size and depth, accessible, all around a feature I never thought I'd adore as much as I do.
B00L1HERE6|5|Perfect! So cute and perfect for my best friends bachelorette!
B00B4A2FFI|5|excelente
B002ZG8IY2|2|The sizes were to small. How do I return them for the next size up?
B00GHQX08A|4|I like the size and design.  I hope they soften up more with repeated washings.  They get the job done, though.
B00AXZ4CT2|5|I love these so much. I use them for ocean swimming to get a little bit of buoyancy when it's too warm for a wetsuit. Unlike some of the other floaty shorts, these don't restrict leg movement at all and are super comfortable. I've swum with these for an entire open water season, and they're not showing any signs of wear at all.
B0060B81PO|5|I bought this for my upcoming wedding. It's the perfect size, exactly what I was looking for. Looks beautiful in my hair!
B008ETE0KA|4|Just what I was looking for, an old fashioned, clear so can see change, separate from wallet, coin purse.  Reasonable price, seems a bit flimsy on arrival but has held up well always full of change.  Did not give 5 stars as once it opened (perhaps I didn't close it all the way) and the change went to the bottom of my purse.  Overall very satisfied with it.
B00DOPIE4M|5|Exactly what my husband wanted. :)
B00QUWU4G2|5|They are so cute:) Totally worth the buy, I love them.
B009NPBP84|5|Nice like it
B009I3Z6KO|5|Super fun!  A little difficult to see through the face covering. Sizing chart was helpful.
B00FZR1IWC|2|I was able to wear them once. After washing, they shrunk (Shrank?  Shrinked? ) so much I threw them away.
B00C7ZH5W2|5|It was a gift for my husband for his birthday, he loves it :)
B007KVMJ1K|5|I got this hat and I am sooooo glad I did. I use it every day during the summer so I wont get burnt, and so far it has worked! I have gotten quite a few compliments too, and I noticed even though it was breezy somedays, it never blew off my head. (for me it didnt anyway, haha)
B00M42J4RC|5|My 12 year old daughter really likes them, they are soft and well made.  They also wash well (although I don't put them in the dryer)
B00KKCDXYS|2|Too small but could also be my big head.
B00E1Z6G9Y|5|This is so adorable. Come on people, the price is amazing even if you only got the sequined bow.  It's a little stiff but you have to kind of play with it.  Gently bending to kind of give it the curve of the baby's head.  It's perfect after you kind of mold it to the curve of the head. My grand baby is 9 months old and it fit very well.
B00HK0WNNA|5|I don't know if all Dockers pants are this way (this is my first pair), but they have figured it out in how to make women want to buy their pants.  They run super large.  Oh really?  My usually size 6-8 bod needs a size 4 in these??  Don't mind if I do.<br /><br />Stroking my ego aside, these pants are well made, soft material, and are very comfortable, without bunching weird, or being too short.  They hit just right at the not too low to look like a teenager, and not up near the belly button so I feel like I'm back in the 90s.  They are really awesome pants.  Plus, they make me feel super awesome about being a size 4.  It's a win-win.
B00MV2IMK0|1|It fit my 9 year old niece
B000WD164O|4|Wrinkle free, nice quality fabric and fits great. I think there's not much more to say since that says it all. I only wish they had this exact shirt with button collars.
B00E0FFA56|5|Looks and fits as expected
B006AA5FH2|5|I bought these before a trip to New York and they worked perfectly! Kept me warm, looked adorable, and I even got some compliments from the locals asking me where I bought it!
B0026P45TO|5|I wear a 38D.  Needless to say, I want padded shoulders and a bra that can do the job comfortably.  It does!
B00DWXJWUQ|5|Bought this for my little brother. Our dad always wears one and hes in the stage where he wants too also. So I got him tmnt (which hes obsessed with) he loves it
B000WNRIKU|5|Love it.
B00NL9DELY|5|Very Soft and nice looking!
B00KHBF7V4|5|Giving as a gift but the quality as far as I can tell is good for the price... When my husband gets it we will put it to the test ...
B00L02V560|4|The dress was very nice the only thin the sleeves were a little tight that's why I did not give it a 5 star.
B001KG0EN6|4|I wear large Hanes tee's and the three I bought were very form fitting and uncomfortable. Hope to be able to wear them once I drop a few lbs.
B005SN5I74|5|as said in title. its more than i would like to pay for when it comes to undershirts, but it feels a lot softer than fruit of the loom undershirts.
B00HESUEG6|4|These leggings are awesome!  I'm 5'3 116lbs and a small fit me like a glove.  The matte black are perfect- not too shiny.  The only problem was that after washing once they started to run at the seams.  I contacted the seller and they immediately resolved the problem.  Unfortunately for me I took their suggestion of going up a size and the replacement pair I received in medium don't fit nearly as well,  they are baggy in the knees.  I love the leggings so much that I came back to buy another pair in small and just will hand wash and see if that helps but now they don't have them in small.  Sad day :(  Really good customer service, by the way.  I was impressed!
B00BUJ0Q2C|5|I am completely satisfied with the look and feel of this hat. My son is a huge Superman fan and wanted a hat that was outside the traditional colors you find in the stores. I am completely satisfied with the quality of the product so far and so is my son and it fit him. He is caught between youth hats looking to small and adult sizes not quite fitting. The small does not look big on him at all. There is nothing really bad to say about it. The embroidery was done well and there were no issues with the placement. In my opinion, the Superman under the bill is a little much, but does not take away from the overall look of the hat depending on how you wear it. If you are looking for a good quality, alternate color version Superman hat, this is a great option. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B00JX1P1V0|3|Love the fabric, very soft and fits nice.
B00936OC4M|5|PROUD TO WEAR IT, WILL BE BUYING MORE.  GREAT LOOKING AND WELL MADE.  I WANT ONE FOR EVERY JACKET I OWN
B00PGPDER0|5|So  trendy looking and warm.
B0027VT5Y2|5|It fits really well, everybody loved around here.
B00CLRCHMO|4|The quality was just okay. The design on the shirt is not as clear as I would like, but my son loves &#34;Bubble Guppies&#34; and there are very few choices for clothing with &#34;Bubble Guppies&#34; characters on it.  He loves the shirt and that makes it worth it.
B00DHKQY8W|4|Please I require a Tracking ID in Venezuela because it is necessary for processing, thank you for your cooperation in this regard
B00AFTP1L4|5|I have several pairs of Buffalo jeans and decided I liked the looks of this belt. The fit is perfect (True to size)!! As with most belts you go with 2 sizes larger than your waist. The textured leather and high quality buckle make this a very nice looking and comfortable belt.
B00JH1L2AU|1|Sadly, the robe is made of poor quality material. There are countless threads pulling out. I'm afraid to wash/dry it for fear it will start falling apart. Would expect this level of quality for 5 to 10 dollars at the flea market. Can't recommend and won't buy again. Just hoping it will hold together 'til spring.
B00MHO7LWM|5|Super cute and super stylish.  I love to see my wife wearing this at home.
B009ZJDAAE|5|These are my daughter's favorite tights. She likes the lines in back, but doesn't like mesh tights, these are a great alternative to mesh. These are soft, look great and don't squeeze her waist.
B00IFGGN7U|5|Love these pants, great for MIA
B00PWIGN24|5|Love these socks! Great deal that arrived quickly.
B0089FC7QI|5|Fit well and do the trick for getting in the pool
B00C5TOAQO|5|This really fit nicely. Can't wait to wear on beach.
B0044T800A|5|going to see them this november with my dad so I thought I'd buy some shirts that we could wear... this one is for my dad, when I gave it to him he said '20 years ago when I was just getting this album, I never thought that one day I'd be seeing them with my daughter'
B002K6F6NI|5|Very comfortable as a maternity bra, I have trouble with the clasps but that might just be me. Sizes run normal and are easy to figure out.
B007XHIRV2|5|These pants fit me so well ! I ordered size medium (5'9&#34; and 135 lb) and even after wearing these pants several times without washing they do not fall down.
B00IMV35RY|4|Love the shirt. I got lots of compliments on it...I'm 5'8, 180 lbs and a size large fits me great
B00OQ51BSA|5|Metal on
B00EB13R5O|5|I love these pants. I have a few pairs from the WallFlower brand and they fit me just perfectly. I have had them for a while and have not noticed any bad quality from them. I will buy from this company again and would recommend them to a friend.
B00G62Y55C|2|Pros: Beautiful color & design.<br />Size: Small here means Asian American Small=buy Large for this jacket. I'm American size 2 and L just fits.<br />If you want to wear a sweater underneath- you need XL.<br />Cons: Hood is too small to be usable, the underarm/shoulder does not fit quite right, too snug, no wiggle room even when you get the right size. I'm not sure the local seamstress can fix it for cheap.<br />Not worth returning to China because of shipping. Hope someone at Goodwill can use it.<br />The $$ lesson: Do not buy a jacket online unless you tried the brand before OR shipping is not more than the item.
B00M0EYZ1E|3|Not really what i expected they dont really look like the do in the photo they are tight made for smaller calves, and they arent very long. they are pretty fluffy which i love and they will do for my outfit for zeds dead at  red rocks this summer :) probably wont buy again because i like my fluffies longer and different material. but they are there in case i need them definitely not worth 40 dollars though
B0085OY9CS|3|The top is cute, but I wish the sleeves were more proportioned to the shirt, they seemed a bit long.  However, overall it's cute and I have received some compliments on it when wearing it.
B00HANNWX2|4|This is perfect for North Texas weather during the few winter days we have. Our baby is 10 months old and this size is perfect. She is 15 lbs and 27 inches- hopefully this can give you a better idea of the fit. She will definitely still fit in this for the season. While wearing winter coats in car seats is NOT recommended, this particular bunting is a thin fleece and not bulky.
B004VMQPE8|5|The grandson wanted these for Christmas.  Teenagers????  I got them in time but was sent the wrong size, so when I got ahold of the company, the size was all sold out.  They offered me the correct size in a BETTER quality, no extra charge AND got them here in time.  Couldn't ask for a happier grandson.
B004HY27WE|1|Returned this immediately. I should've heeded the negative reviews. Yes, it was all moldy inside!!! Gross!!
B00MI3R5VE|5|Beautiful dress but I was too tall for it I am 6'0&#34;
B00GP0GKXA|4|Beautiful and good quality fabric
B001WAL2BS|4|Its a present so hopefully they like it, but the tshirt looks great and it looks just like the picture.
B00KG2HEH4|1|It is large for a newborn and the the ears eyes and face are not position properly.  Looks awkward.
B00O72X798|3|I love the colors however the removable straps are very annoying ...every time I wash them the straps come off, and I have to search other clothing to find the straps ...other than that they get the job done
B00MLVTB5G|5|Bought it for my daughter on Christmas and she loves them.
B00R1NYZO6|3|Beautiful material, however it is slightly see through.
B00KRIQT82|5|It was a gift for my boyfriend and it came in the mail sooner than expected and fit just right and he loved it.
B005OFLTEM|5|I'm a size 31 from the waist so got the small size They fit comfortable I'm a pretty slim guy but these where snug all over
B003AOE3SS|5|I am very pleased with the whole deal deliverly product, I will buy again and tell my people they also will look better in your product, Thanks again
B00LHX21MO|5|Great Price, high waisted, really black. It fits like a size 30 (also diesel)
B00DOIBRZW|5|Love the colors!  Can't wait for the party in wearing this to. I know it will be a hit. It is exactly what I was hoping it would be only better.
B00FB4I2IC|1|The yellow is deceiving.  Not what you will receive,  Has pocket sewn on front with illegible writing.  Would not recommend
B00OFRPMTI|4|😊
B003N10NVE|4|Very flexible leather. Beautiful. I have had problems finding a belt that would hold up to daily wear.  I think this one is going to make it.  Wish sizing was easier to calculate.  I didn't want it too small so erred on the larger size. Yup, its not too small.  I may have to add a hole or two soon.  Big buckle. A little wider than I'd thought.  Would love one 1/2 inch narrower.
B0013B3NNG|5|Playtex Women's 18 hour bra:  I would not get any other kind of bra~it's that good, especially for women needing an uplift bra, and the straps are great, long lasting too.
B005Z5UJ1A|3|the cup size is big. it is full coverage which is nice. I do not have any issues with the wires on the side as others do. They also wash well.
B00I7MOEX2|4|Bought this for Easter and felt really good, I have known for years the Empire waist compliments my figure. Received many kind remarks, Haven't laundered it yet so my opion my change, but as of now happy with my purchase. I might add you can't tell really easily but there is some stitching along the bottom ( 3 in or so from bottom) that I wasn't expecting.
B0084K0I96|5|Bought for our son for Christmas and they are great. He wears them to work and they are comfortabvle and stay put.
B0062R76JS|4|These are very comfortable and perfect with loafers and other casual shoes.  I wish there was a three pack of just black, but the white and grey will work for some uses.
B008RKPRJ4|3|One of the rivets near the buckle already pulled through.  The second one, not the first load bearing one.
B003IBLTT4|5|Lovely item !!
B003LYJAB2|4|Little small
B0058IDY16|5|Father loved it when he opened it on his 97th birthday.  He got a green one last year & wanted another.
B00J1LW5ZC|5|it works great materials are good
B000F1NFPG|4|Personally I believe this is a great wallet, the texture is great, it can hold a lot of stuff in it (which is very important, or so I'm told). If anyone is looking for a wallet I highly recommend this one.
B002R0FCUE|5|It is excellente, good fabric, well done, I lke it a lot. I recomended it a 100 %  GOOD L like
B002YT50B4|5|Super cute! looks just like the photo!
B004126Q2O|5|Loved the fit under my snug beach wedding dress. I'm 5'3&#34; with a long torso and had no problems. Using the br was a snap, literally. Would recommend this product to any women looking for a seamless look and happy evening.
B0032YVLPE|5|These short fit comfortably. The waistband is very nice, better than other Dickies I've purchased. They come out of the dryer ready to wear!<br />I would purchase these shorts again.
B002IKARGC|5|Love these pants.  I have been wearing Urbane for 2 years and finally gave away all of my other nursing pants and just bought a bunch of these.  I am 5'2, athletic, and was wearing xsmall petite, but I like my pants to go down to the bottom of my danskos and I like they pretty big and comfy so I ordered 4 pairs of small petite and they are perfect.  Love the colors and they wash and wear well.  Love!
B00BYL11Q6|5|This was even better than I expected. The material itself is very comfy and high quality. I highly recommend this shirt.
B0011RL2IA|5|I was excited to see him in his new dickies. He was excited like it was Christmas.
B00SKPUONK|3|Under shirt short and tight, blouse too long
B009XDJKH4|5|Satisfied
B00SAJ0HDS|5|But I love this dress I got it repaired
B00I5KGKU6|5|Very high quality, very good fitting, very cute. Only complaint is the matching belt it came with was not the same size as the dress. I will have to put in my own holes to make it fit. But it's gorgeous!
B00B8K5ESO|5|its soft, a bit small for me, but that was my fault for not ordering a bigger size. Its perfect, it keeps me warm and the show is flat out awesome.
B000AXPJ6W|1|I ordered these hoping that I'd have some great new silk pajamas to replace mine that had worn out.  Let me tell you, if you're a small person like I am these are not at all for you.  You will be completely drowning in them.  I looked like I was 5 years old and playing dress up in my mother's clothing; the small is not at all small... I was highly disappointed.
B004R1JVP8|5|Awesome shirts
B0038MLWHW|4|Good jacket for the price. Wrinkles easily. Runs large in size and hard to unsnap, concerned that could pull the snaps from the material over time. Get what you pay for.
B00E01QJ2I|3|Size felt a little too tight for not being pre-shrunk 100% cotton. I recommend ordering a size larger Ito accommodate for shrinking.
B0093KV5PW|5|I got this for my daughter for her Halloween costume. She was Rapunzel (disney). The corset looked great and seemed sturdy and well built. I expect I'll see it as part of future costumes...
B00AABNGX2|5|I gave this t-shirt as a gift and the recipient was pleased. The fit is good and the print looks great.
B00422M6FE|5|I like this wallet, the classic black color and the genuine leather is good quality. A good and fashion wallet
B00ONQEGGQ|3|This dress is adorable but WAY too short. I am 5'6&#34; and 175lbs. Could not wear it to the event I bought it for. But otherwise very cute.
B0098WCXBU|5|ROOK is the best, passion in their designs, great quality in print and fabric. Looking forward to buying more of their products
B005P4LV90|5|I did really love the collection from a Mexican made Levi's.<br />The quality of the fabric is really amazing.<br />The fabric is durable and so much comfortable.
B00M8ZQT4G|5|Not what one would call a sexy nightgown by any means but perfect for keeping me warm on cold winter nights like tonight when we have 12-14 inches of snow on the ground outside!
B00KRYPMKC|5|Is this the best sweatshirt ever made? Nope, but I highly doubt you'll find anything better for $7.<br /><br />It's a nicer fit than with men's sweatshirts. It's still comfortably loose, but the sleeves aren't so awkwardly baggy, for example. I'm also a fan of the Raglan sleeves, and the zipper is high-quality metal YKK zipper. The hood is only one layer of fabric instead of being lined like most hoodies, but that's not surprising given the price point.
B0078TX0CQ|4|When these glasses came in the other day, I was excited. I was going to replace my lenses on my mask with these because the image of the product looked amazing.. when they came in, they were blank.. no hexagon designs in the lenses.. still look good, but not the same picture<br />still worth buying
B0036OS6KI|3|Slightly large in the crotch.
B002AQJP2Q|5|great for small breasts!
B00BW042RO|5|GREAT piece of luggage!!!<br />This is a Christmas present for my 6 year old granddaughter. It arrived and is adorable. It is actually large enough for traveling.
B001FA15EY|5|She really liked them...
B00ID4RI8W|3|These socks look good, feel good, the price is right, but after a few wears they are already wearing out.
B00C79DJ5A|3|There is a pocket which is hard to see in the picture.  Got a size small for a 5'8&#34; frame and the shirt is loose
B0083QLPY8|3|I bought a box of bra extenders at Penny's for $8.00.  The Penny's product contained 6 bra extenders, the Maidenform product contains 3 extenders.  Go for the Penny's product.
B00CAI9ABA|5|Perfect!
B00IJHJGOC|1|Chrapest material ever. Tbread started to unravel before first washing. Seller is ovetseas so returning cost more than dress don't bother with any of these pathetic dresses.
B00NIQD9U6|1|it is too large for me
B003IL7U0G|4|I ordered my ususal size that I always get. It's to big in the hips. Always sliding around and getting swisted backwards. It rides up my waist to the point that I flash my butt if I'm not careful. Otherwise super cute and fun and flirty.
B00KT6MP8A|1|Too tight
B00HEBN63Q|5|Very soft, comfortable fabric and nice stripe design. The x-small is perfect for me (I like my shirts form fitting - I am 5'4&#34; and about 125 lbs). The side rouching and the length of the shirt is long enough to cover my little post baby belly. The nursing snaps/flap allow for easy access for nursing baby.
B00I3Q3ZXM|1|If this was a large, it was not a large in womens.  I expected the womens section but clearly thos was not.
B00IPKMQ72|4|I like the cut and the longer legs, nice fit.
B00A3S42NU|5|This was exactly what I was looking for.  Nice shading of colors, lightweight, but not too flimsy, nice crinkly texture, very packable.
B00H4UI2E0|4|I was so excited to find a simple dress WITH SLEEVES!  The fabric is decent, maybe a little thinner than I like but probably very comfy for summertime, and the color is exactly as represented on my computer monitor.  The neckline is great - very becoming, even on my broad-shouldered frame.  I think it runs about a half-size smaller than I would expect; I waver between a 12 and a 14, and this 14 is really too tight to wear.  It's shaped beautifully, though,  and makes my curves look pretty good.  If I could just lose another 5 pounds...
B0001ZMD5O|4|If you want to look good and stay warm for the fall, it's a good buy.  Do not let the cheesy name of the jacket deter you.
B00G9GC9NK|4|The shirt's design is awesome as is all things Breaking Bad.  The quality is only so-so.  The cotton is thin, really almost see through.  I wear a medium and sometimes small in misses/women's sizes but figured I better order a large.  It is FITTED.  I could have ordered an XL!<br /><br />So while I am happy with the shirt I wish I would have ordered 2 sizes up.  Take that into consideration as well as the thin quality of the cotton.  I will definitely be air drying as not to shrink it!
B00RQB1O3I|1|My son is underweight yet these were too tight around his leg/thigh area. Disappointing bc I ordered a size larger too based on reading other reviews.
B00LK4SKNO|3|I bought this for my hubby.  The fit is excellent, and Red lining gives the impression of a more expensive jacket.  However the quality and material are not great, and does not hold up very well.
B003WYIP80|5|Great fit and comfort.
B0051D8PM6|4|A little big, a little long, but I would buy again, they are comfy, and I really like the color!
B00EIJLHE2|5|Great with my winter coat, also a great price!! I usually where a lot of black and this helps bring some color into my outfits!
B00W5PA4TA|5|Beautiful and comfortable fits perfectly
B00C1EP1UC|4|Great looking and great made. My husband usually wears a medium but these are a little baggy on him. Other then that great product.
B0057X9LKU|4|This was a nice well made t-shirt.  My husband likes it a lot.  I just wish it came in other colors
B004USQDLS|1|Don't know why the picture shows, and the description says it is an adjustable hat when it isn't adjustable. Weird..............
B003M2XXTI|5|Lovely outfit for my granddaughter's third birthday party coming up.  It will be combined with pink and will sport a pink poodle applique.
B005I0BATM|5|Bought it for my son, he wears it all the time and has been asked many times where he got it.
B00FROUP2W|5|Blouse fits very well,  Gives extra room for maturing young girls.
B00P3Y9RK2|5|Wonderful
B00JNTLW42|5|I love these pants. Huge deep pockets, comfortable, thick & warm enough for the coming winter.
B008L1P582|5|I bought this for my daughter she just loved it.  She said she had so many friends complimenting on the dress.
B00QIMB4EA|2|The XLT was too tight across the shoulders which is unfortunate because it it a nice shirt.  Another brand in XLT fit just fine so I would be leary about purchasing another Van Heusen shirt.
B005GYGFZO|5|Super compfy and good price for them. I wear them all the time! I wouldn't really suggest these for any extreme physical activity though
B00ZU1IBFK|2|Also it was not gathered around the bottom as shown in picture and that is what I was expecting. Will be returning item.
B009WS5S26|1|Buy beware.  This is not an infinity scarf.  It's a very long and wide scarf, like any other.  If you're looking for an infinity scarf, look elsewhere.  bummed out!
B006KGHDAI|4|Bought as a gift for my son, he has another and likes the brand. A good shirt for welding and good price find.
B00F5MYYYG|4|For the price, this fleece jacket is a good deal. It is a thinner fleece that is best used as a layer under a shell type jacket.
B00PSK3XQ0|5|Great
B00IA4C998|5|Fits great! Feels great!! Arrived when promised.
B00NFHY68C|5|Love it and fits perfect!!!
B00PC49LCC|2|If you have manhood in the front and round trunk get an XL
B00L2KXDE2|5|Nice looking shirt.
B006I2AGMQ|5|I'm 5'10&#34; 195 pounds.  I went with the large because I was looking for a snug but comfortable fit and am for then satisfied with the sizing.  If you need to layer this with a heavy sweater and want a bit more freedom of movement you may want to go one size up to an XL.  Great jacket for fall weather with temps down to 30's.
B00FE4H1CW|4|It fist ok for me but im normally M so for this to be L is a little small maybe
B009G15SCY|5|I bought this tie for a wedding I went to this past weekend. Shipped fast and is a great looking tie. I got tons of compliments on it. It is very well made, as well.
B00L5VYI8S|1|I wish not to give this product any stars I received my item before shipment date which was wonderful the shorts fit nice but I went to button the shorts up and there are no holes to button them up!!
B00MTHH2LM|5|Nice color, fit as expected, I love it
B00BUT65CW|1|nope.
B0009MZVHG|5|Love them!!
B00VXX6Y6C|5|Was brown and not black when it arrived.
B00E38GARC|5|Fits perfectly and the color is fabulous!  I'm a 36B and the size medium bra was the right size.  The Cosabella Never Say Never thongs are the best fitting ever!
B00ESJWA5W|5|I bought this for a valentines day present for my girlfriend hoping it would make it on time I purchased early. It made it 2 days after I bought it. Fits perfectly and she loves it. Great buy!!!!
B00NOR6YWO|5|Love Oakley!  Had an exchange, I fat fingered the size, but there was quick return response!!
B001C7JMX6|5|fit true to size and was happy with costume
B00C3EYXAO|5|Comfy, good coverage & support. Well-made. I love the racer-back style-no drooping bra straps! It works w/most necklines but the straps are closer to the neck & show in tops w/wider necklines.
B006SRTGB8|4|I have only had the chance to wear them once, but they were very comfortable, di dnot bunch up and kept me warm.
B00KOS4SCE|5|This outfit looks great on my boy.
B00RJOT4BG|5|Excellent!
B00KB1PEQS|2|She didn't like the material so she returned.
B0013Y3FIG|4|My daughter is 6 months old and in the 73rd percentile for height and she just barely fit in this costume.  The peas do come off easily but she had fun playing with them.  They stayed put just fine for pictures.
B009KMS17S|5|It was given as a gift and, so far, the recipient loves it.  I've heard the design fades after washing and will comment later if he experiences that, but at this point - great shirt, well made and true to size.
B00LM475I8|1|I bought 2 of these - so disappointed. Very cheaply made and not a phone flip case wallet as they lead you to believe. I'm not that picky but these are cheap and nasty!!
B00KBXWHWA|4|As others have posted my these guys sizes are way off and too small.. I ordered a 5x in this top but others fits like most other tops in a 3x. So thanks to Amazon reviews I ordered up two sizes and glad I did as its a really  nice top. Seems good quality and have already had quite a few comments wearing it.
B00FX5CRP8|1|Too big and the zipper was broken.
B00I2ZIJ1C|5|Can't beat the price on these! Better quality than I expected, too!
B001CL8JPE|4|Great coat for the price. I will say that when I took this coat out of the box upon arrival I was concerned about how lightweight it was; did'nt expect it would keep me warm enough. I was mistaken, as it is quite sufficient on a cold day. The style is flattering and I love the length; easy to maneuver in and out of the car.
B00T2WBJJ8|5|I purchased this item that came with three items to cover your stomach and help my hips.<br />I had a baby daughter 2 years ago and i still cant seem to get rid of the 'mummy tummy'.I have exercised,done crunches,cardio to lose my stomach,ended up suffering from a bad back and hip pain.<br />The best thing about this item is my stomach is going in and my diastasis is reducing.I am also eating healthy,going for regular walks .Any women who has had a baby but cant get rid of the mummy tummy try this.Its Cheap and very good for money.
B00NXMK1EM|4|I'm normally a 1x/2x, but only the 3x was available. I bought it, and regret nothing. It's big and slouchy, and oh so comfy.
B00P633OSQ|5|loved it
B00SDMMJ9M|3|The shirt fits as expected but the quality could be better. I bought the white shirt, same brand and the white one had good material. I was disappointed with the the quality of the material but the fit and finish was top notch.
B001Q7MSH4|5|I purchased these pants one size up so that I can layer for the colder weather.  They are easily pulled on and adjustable at the bottoms for tall or short hiking boots.  Easy to roll up and throw in a bag.  The quality of Columbia is outstanding!  Compared to similar pants I have purchased in the past, they are thicker, yet more breathable.
B004TK6KHE|5|Bought these boots for my husband for Christmas. He loves them, they took some wearing in like most boots do.
B00G20WZ00|5|excellent feel
B00KV9H31E|5|Good jeans, feel sturdy, slightly longer than I expected, but overall great value.
B00007FPAZ|2|I have had a horrible time trying to keep these pants &quot;up&quot;. Even though I'm at the end of my second trimester, I must not have enough of a belly to keep them from dragging down. I have rolled up the cuffs, rolled down the waist, safety pinned the waist and tried hard to shrink them, but to no avail. I gave them two stars because I do think they are good quality, but if you are a bit on the small side, you may want to consider a different pair of maternity jeans--at least try them on first!
B0061HUH7M|3|Bought these for my daughter to wear skiing.  The gloves are OK, they are waterproof, and keep her hands dry. My daughter wears them on warmer days.  Anytime the temps dip below the mid 30's, she swtches to warmer gloves or mittens.
B00XXTRMR4|5|Fits great, looks adorable on. Can't wait to wear it out.
B00B44T9L2|5|These are my favorite scrub pants ever!!!  I now have every color but the purple and the green.  They are the most comfortable scrubs I have ever had and I have been a nurse since 1994.  The fabric is so smooth and soft, and if you take them right out of the dryer and hang them up, no need for ironing.  The fit is great, the feel is awesome, and I always get complements on how well dressed I am.  Try them, you will love them and end up buying more.....
B00QO549OI|4|Love the jacket however the zipper sticks and feels like it may not last.
B000VK62HY|1|I THINK THEY MUST GET THE \\"SLIGHTLY IRREGULAR\\" ITEMS FROM OTHER COMPANIES BECAUSE THIS BRA WAS OBVIOUSLY IRREGULAR DID NOT FIT CORRECTLY WAS WAY WAY TOO SMALL. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT
B00KLTE3NK|5|Perfect as shape wear and longer term shaping. After a week, I could already wear the shaper on the tighter hooks, and after 2 weeks I could wear on the tightest hooks. And under clothes, it works better than any shape wear I've ever tried on the market. Bought multiple!
B00J3H4PDY|5|The feel of the fabric, the length, the true to size fit and the vibrant color made this purchase worthwhile. I would order from this vendor again.
B003JD3WIW|2|The first time my daughter wore this, it tore in several places.  I would only recommend it for a display in the store window, otherwise it falls to pieces...
B00FEW5XZ6|5|I love it! Very spacious and fashionable. Price is terrific too.
B004EHZ3DE|3|I'm usually a 34C, but ordered a 36C after reading reviews indicating the band might be small.  A 36 band is still waaayy too small.  I'll have to return it and order up to a 38C.  Otherwise, the cut is great.
B00DOEULSU|3|These run so small. I gave them to my toddler daughter.
B00JFCC3YK|4|I like the material and the fit is flattering.  However the neckline is just too wide and I had to put in darts in the back to make it so it did not fall off of my shoulders.  Also sleeves were a little tight in the top arm part.
B007VIWG9M|5|I like them very much.  they fit well and look great with my boots.  I thought I was too old for skinny jeans but not so.
B0002I914Q|5|I just had to buy a shirt for my girlfriend.  She loves this type of stuff. Where can I get some more stuff like this?
B006VYJC1C|4|I love Hatley sleepshirts, but the new ones aren't quite as roomy.  Still fits, but tossing and turning isn't as comfortable. Still so much better than grannie gowns!
B003AOYSBA|5|Purchased for a man, and it fit and looked great.  Nice and warm for cool New England Halloween nights.
B004R8X7WE|5|Best store with the perfect customer service. The product are good quality and money worth. I like my pants that I buy and just feeling them it will last years. Thank to amazon
B00KIZMF8C|5|However, the description says, as far as I remember, 70% cotton, however, it's polyester.
B0024HIGFS|5|Fits as described!  Thanks!
B00M3YDTT0|5|Love this coat! Fits perfectly, I have long arms and the sleeves are just right in length.
B00HVXJLSQ|2|I bought a bright blue Jones New York cover up at a Swim store & fell in love with it bc of the fit & especially bc of the silky soft material. I loved it so much, I wanted to buy it in another color! After finding what I thought was the exact same product, I bought it in 3 colors. The colors were true to what I thought I was buying, but the fit was not as fitted as the one I bought in person & the texture was rough on my skin. I've never been a fan of online shopping & bc of my disappointment right before leaving for vacation with my new items, I'll stick to shopping at my local stores so I know what I'm paying for.
B00UY2WFY8|5|Nice selection...can usually find one to go with any tie
B00OBYE7PA|5|Cute dress!
B00HHTOZ5I|5|ADORABLE
B0072ER5O6|1|I was searching for pants for my son who wears a 32x30.  The pants were all made of a scratchy stiff material and were much too long.  My son is 5'4&#34;  My husband, who is 5'11&#34; held them up to him and the length would have fit him!  Never buying again
B0092R88DI|1|I ordered 4 beanies, at the exact same time. From the same seller ALL 1N ALL. To my dismay they were shipped in two different packages. I watched as one was held up in New Jersey for days, way past the estimated arrival. The other arrived just a day past the original estimation but the 2nd was nowhere to be found. I've been tracking this item, and it confidently states \\"delivered\\" as of two days ago. It's definitely not here. (I've been home this entire period of time) smells like a rip off to me. Scam artists Id say. Don't order. The ones that did show up, won't stretch out. Don't waste your time.
B00HZGJWNS|5|Adorable shorts!
B0050FZ3IE|5|Very soft and nice.
B00VJE1EU6|4|Very nice
B005AKL8TW|3|I guess I should have read description before buying. I thought it was a dress but its a wrap. still nice though
B000L1C8KS|1|these are so noticeable thru sheer cloths, can see total outline shape of petals also.  I returned them.  \\"go cheap go twice\\"  also, it was a real project getting the plastic sheet off of petals.
B00QQ8TEQ6|5|Great starter outfits for newborn baby boy!  Fabric is great, and Gerber does make quality products!  I would buy again if I am invited to another baby shower.
B00AR9M642|4|Bought these as gift, and she is very happy with them. They are true to size and they fit very nicely.  She can wear them out for drinks, or even for our short bike rides.  Great material too, it's nice and light.
B008GST8YC|5|I put this on my newborn son he weighs 7 lbs. It is comfy and soft and I like that I can hide his hands. Still has room to grow. Umbilical cord stump is open so it can dry faster.. I love the shirt.
B00MNGMEGW|5|i love it
B0052ZLOH6|5|This was our second Disana purchase and we couldn't be more pleased with both purchases. These wool covers save us in our over nights with our cloth diapers. They are amazing because they help my son stay dry by allowing the moisture to evaporate. Be sure to order some wool delicate wash and lanolize before your first use!
B00ZQ4KOGU|5|My husband hates to shop, so I tend to be person who buys clothes for him (thank goodness).  I was excited to have the opportunity to give him both this shirt and the short-sleeved version to try, as they have built-in SPF 50 (he tends to refuse to wear sunscreen) and looked perfectly cool and breathable for hot summer days.  We received the short-sleeved version first (in the lightest color) and he loves that one.  I ordered the long-sleeved version in the blue for variety’s sake, and he is equally happy with it.  I prefer the long-sleeved tee myself in terms of better spf coverage, but a long-sleeved shirt is not always comfortable in really warm weather, so I am glad my husband has both options for warm and cool temperatures.  He loves it!  Both shirts are very breathable, cool and comfortable.  I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
B00631VEBO|3|The material was cheap. I liked the other brand from the UK better & it had more lace!
B00JJHC5YO|2|I liked the way they looked but when I put them on they tore it was two right hands instead of right and left.
B00LA544RY|5|It's great!!!!
B005MV0M9Q|5|Got this for my husband and he loves it! True to size and good material, looks like its standing up to the test of time, graphic still holding strong after quite a few washes!
B00GRS40YQ|2|Not as pictured!  They are very soft but not leggings, these are footed tights.  A little disappointed.
B00KIUYTOU|5|Unique and really great design.<br />I'm looking forward to do shopping again.
B00ORMAQEC|2|Too tight
B00H5BEVX4|5|great thanks
B00T3NUYGA|1|Seller indicated jacket fits snugly, but should have also indicated sizing is much smaller than normal.  I normally wear a medium to large coat.  I ordered a large and the sleeves are at my forearm.  Unless this is supposed to be a 3/4 sleeve coat, it is much too small.  Update:  seller did reach out to correct, but since I ordered one size larger compared to previous coat purchases, and this fit everywhere but the sleeves, I will just chalk up as lesson learned. I am concerned that an XL might fit in sleeves, but then too big elsewhere. Also disappointed that is was made in China.
B008RA7896|5|I have gotten compliments on this hoody several times now. Its very casual but still cute, which makes it perfect for every day occasions like shopping, or meeting a friend for lunch etc. The style is very girly yet casual, so its great for when you wanna be comfy but still look cute.
B007EKQM7Y|5|This is really a terrific product:  attractive, warm, snug fit and collapses to fit in a coat pocket.  The only deficit is that when the internal spring is fully flexed - as it needs to be to fit my Size 7 7/8 head - it has a tendency to twist slightly so that I periodically have to re-adjust it on my ears.  Otherwise, I could not be more pleased with this product.
B007UT53RO|2|I bought 3 of these Leggings<br />in size Medium<br />1 fit great the other 2 where  smaller<br />exact same size .I don't get it<br />the all should fit the same<br />Brand Name HUE
B001CXUY0A|4|nice length
B004G0AC44|5|Perfect!
B00C6FH0SC|5|I highly recommend these sweats. They're so comfortable and warm. I love dancing in them and honestly even sleeping in them. Perfect.
B00OA075ZE|4|I wear ladies medium so in juniors I order a large. This dress fits me in a large.
B00013ZJLG|5|I bought this bag to replace a Victorinox bag. <br /> <br />MP DJ bag has a straight forward, simple design, which is very attractive. The interior has two compartments, one is zippered, the other is not, but has more depth. DJ bag is made of high quality material. I toss it around in car, train, office, for a year and it still looks brand new! The bag looks like it can easily last 10 years. <br /> <br />DJ bag of medium size can fit my 13\\" Macbook just fine. Though I wouldnt recommend putting any laptop for a long period of time, because DJ bag does not have padding. You can get sleeve for laptop, then put the laptop+sleeve in the bag. <br /> <br />The number of colors offered on DJ bag is impressive. There is an optional to buy a shoulder if you want.
B00RVW4W1I|5|Very comfortable trousers.
B0009I4JAA|5|It fits perfectly
B007GCJLFA|5|Perfect fit and comfortable.  Also easy to care for.
B00192WU42|5|I am usually a fruit guy but my experience with these have been good.<br />I lost a bunch of weight and they fit me better.
B00LZKS5IS|4|Nice shirt, good fabric and it actually looks better than it the photos. For people who use regular US M size you must order an L. I bought an M/L size thinking about others reviews and it did not fitted as spected specially in the arms this is like a regular S/M size, specially the length is a little short for an M. Go one size up
B00M27Z6JE|5|These are the perfect basic tunic tops!  Soft, lightweight and comfortable material- they are great for wearing with leggings.  I love that they are loose but not way too oversized as a lot of tunic tops are...they also are not clingy at all.  It fit true to size for me, I ordered this in several colors and they all look great on.  Easy to dress up or down!
B000KK4HKY|5|I purchased these shorts for work around the house so I don't have to use suspenders for jean shorts.  I wanted something on the lighter side but heavy enough to endure working.  Most of my work at home consists of pruning  hedges and trees, both on the ground and on ladders.  Additionally need to cut pruned branches down to fit trash can.  These shorts stay up where they are supposed to and don't slip.  I have a short inseam and these come to the top of my knee.  I like the length to protect my leg from scratches but also to be able to bend my knee easily.  Today I encountered some rose bushes while raking up and they weren't snagged as much as others I have had.  I could also use these for quick trips to the market.  They are perfect for what I intended and would also be great as going out casual if you can live with two pockets and aren't weighted down with junk.
B00B55LIZK|2|These knee highs are too tight on the calves and a bit uncomfortable. The colors are bright. They would probably fit a teenager with thin legs.
B0039PRFSS|5|I enjoy putting this housecoat on when I wake up and make the coffee, outer around the house.  The seersucker fabric is cool for summer mornings in So. California.
B00BZS3HQU|5|Real Purdy 2 !
B00KV9UX0C|1|I don't understand the cut of this dress. The back piece is braided together but it is braided for such a long length that it practically cuts into my neck in the front. It is so uncomfortable! I don't know why they would have sewn together so much material. It doesn't hang like it does in the picture at all. Also I thought it looked like more of a muted yellow but it is actually a very bright yellow and doesn't have the look I was going for. Very disappointing.
B00BSE0I7M|5|I will be ordering more colors of this very soon very comfy exactly what I wanted
B00CW4HPUA|5|love this shirt 100% USA made
B0018OODUA|4|Fit as expected.
B00IT69R7O|5|I REALLY love this cincher! If you don't want to pay for the Ann Cherry brand but still want the same results, GET THIS PRODUCT!!! I absolutely love mines. I wore it all the time, even when I worked out. I wore and washed it so many times, that the wires started to come out, so I am on here ordering another one and just thought I should convince others to do the same! :)
B00URCKP6A|3|It is nice not  exactly what I expected
B00GB7FY8O|5|Came two days earlier than expected. Looks great. Bought then as a gift for my sister, she loves them!
B008X9ZDLG|5|SO SEXY AND LOOKS AMAZING! MY BOYFRIEND CAN'T KEEP HIS HANDS OFF OF ME BECAUSE OF HOW IT LOOKS ON ME! ONLY PROBLEM IS THE BREAST CUP. MY BOOBS KEEP POPPING OUT AND I GOT THE BIGGEST SIZE. OTHER THAN THAT IT FITS TRUE TO SIZE AND LOOKS GORGEOUS.
B000WCYFJ8|5|This case is strong, it protects your phone from reasonable drops and impacts very well while giving you access to all the buttons. The metal shell has a foam rubber lining that holds the phone snugly. I've dropped it a couple times onto the ballast in the trainyard I've been working at and I'm glad I picked this case since the phone came through the impacts fine. My sister and one of the guys I work  with bought this case after seeing mine, and when I lost my first xv6900, one of the first things I did after getting off the phone with the insurance for a replacement was ordering this case again.
B00528CP0I|5|Perfect slip for toddler girls, especially under sleeveless dresses.
B00QAY1Y1O|5|These pants are beyond. They fit amazingly because they hold you in all the right places. They even lift your bottom! I have these in other prints and all the designs are so fun. Get compliments on these all the time. The fabric is strong and really great quality because I've had these for ages and they look like new. There really isn't another brand out there like this for workout clothes.
B006E6ARFM|5|Second time ordering the same wallet love it.... The chicks dig it as well! Every man should have one of these!
B00FQEGXZQ|1|I was really happy with this bra, but after a little more than a month (I rotate my bras/ don't wear the same one consecutively), one of the fabric fasteners that holds the straps in place just popped suddenly.
B007VHL1O4|5|Bought this for my daughter for homecoming dance and it fit perfectly and she loved it. Looked great on her!
B003XGLKQG|3|The dress design is good. But the quality of the material is poor. Too expensive for this type of material
B00BF22KK0|5|I purchased this for my hubby. He absolutely loved it. I debated about ordering a size up (read others reviews) so I took a chance &purchased an XL (hubby wears L) great suggestion. The shirt is 100% cotton and shrunk in dryer to a perfect fit.
B0097GUE4A|4|Very nice quality. Ran true to size for us.
B005IYVX0E|5|I like it!  I'm satisfied with the fit and cut. It suited to my bulky body. I want to buy it again!
B0081NOLLM|3|It looks good...feels cheap really...plus its very light....i would say a 3 star purchase...and given the price you probably get what you paid for i guess.
B00F2V78ZM|1|I used to love these leggings but the last time I ordered them, they were way too large, unlike what I used to get. I'm 5'2, 125 pounds, but even with being &#34;bottom-heavy&#34; these were falling right off me. I was hoping that washing them might shrink them down, but it did not work. I am very disappointed because I really used to love these but my old pairs that actually fit me properly have gotten worn out. Wish they'd have at least mentioned that the sizing has changed because it DEFINITELY has.
B0038XKOX4|5|Perfect!
B00IWYPTLQ|1|It is very bad quality.
B007U6HKR8|5|very beautiful dress even better than the picture, and the best thing is that the flower is a clip on, so you could remove it and clip it on any other dress or even on the shoulder.<br />my daughter is 8 years old but wears 10 due to wide shoulders it fits perfectly and is long enough (under the knees).
B00H40S2X6|1|The fit in the boobs were entirely too small
B00COPU8RO|4|Item doesnt roll, which is super important. A snap at the very top of the cincher would be nice but not a horrible thing. Worked out in it, and man it did its job.
B00BZD3KWG|4|Thick and seem like good quality.  They do seem to run a little small so order big.  My son has worn them several times already and they are holding up nicely.
B00OJXA13A|1|This garment seems to be made of very cheap synthetic yarn and it smells so bad I would have to wash it before wearing.
B001BIYE02|2|Poor quality. Definitely only good for a one time use!
B00K5PBMX4|5|Some people have been complaining about levi changing , but from my experience these are still the best . Maybe im not old enough but my pair tore and I had HAD to replace them so I got these . Simply put , I love em , theyre durable and stylish . Yes there are better jeans out there but these are the best for your buck , why spend 100 bucks on a jeans when youre just gonna do something dumb like tear it , oh unless youre just sitting on your butt all day then .... why jeans ? Why not wear some bloody dress pants . Seriously people jeans are awesome but theyre still rugged pants meant to hold up to most activities , so again ,why spend a ridiculous amount on jeans ? Just not smart mate , thats what dress pants are for. Thats not to say these arent good for business casual though , I pull a corduroy sports jacket on and it looks awesome but be a big boy and wear the right pants for the right occasion .
B001KUBJ4A|5|great fit
B00BMURT88|2|I wanted new leggings to wear but they are so thin that you can see through them!.. Not good for what I wanted them for!
B001JB3E7U|5|Bought a bunch of these. Tired of the old, white cotton boxers. Looked at a bunch of stores in California to find them, but none had them in stock. Even called the factory, who said they were supposed to be in stock. Go figure! Anyway, found them here and LOVE them. I'm a big guy, and they fit comfortably. Even have a series of attractive patterns and designs, so they don't look too boring if I walk around in them. Buy them and enjoy.
B001CZETJU|1|Fit 0-3 Months Only!!!<br />The size tag is for infants aged 0-6 months but we had difficulty squeezing our 3.5 month old into this. Only used once!  the hole for the head is too small-can only stretch it up to 7.5inches diameter.  Won't fit if baby head size is over 14.5inches.  I'm disappointed with this outfit!  never wrote any review on amazon for hundreds previous purchases.  This is the first review left! Very disappointed for the $20+ paid.
B0085IC6HY|5|The price was very cheap and did not expect good quality. Where it everywhere and it is a comfortable sweater.
B00CI06TM8|5|I LOVE IT
B008BF5NAS|5|Love texting with my warm gloves.
B00MNE9QQU|5|When you order these thing of them like activewear pants...considering the off duty line is a stylish take on activewear (except not ideal for working out of course.)  I wear XS in all activewear, however with some brands I wear XXS.  I'm a 23&#34; waist, which is equivalent to the XXS in these.  They fit perfectly, and the fabric is stretchy.  They're flattering and very versatile.  Highly recommend.  There's a ton of reviews about them running too small but that's inaccurate.
B0058YUH1U|4|Normally slim fits work perfectly with my husband, but it wasn't slim enough. That was a bummer and the fabric was a little more see through then we would like, but it's perfect for summer.
B009RUNKFQ|5|I love all things Big Bang Theory so this t-shirt was a no brainer.  Love the color a lot.  Very soft fabric and it washes well.
B00LF4B1IK|5|Bright colors, light weight.  Just what we were looking for.
B00BAY45JM|5|It is difficult to buy a swimsuit when you are trying a million of them on, so buying one online seems insane!  So very happy and surprised that it fits perfectly and is adorable
B0045G1XHY|4|Jacket runs small, I had to return my large and get a XL Coat. I usually wear a large but would recommend that you go up one full size.
B00LM60R0Y|5|Warm, fits comfortably!
B00CZ9IZXS|5|excelente
B00GS1A52I|5|nice quality, my brother-in-law only wears it as achieved
B009DJCS7C|5|like it
B00NPC09OW|4|..a little tight with the cards but overall a great product.
B008O2UYY8|5|Kate Bootcut are fantastic. Very comfortable and a perfect fit..  Will be buying more of this product.and they are  great value for money.
B00MV3GVNY|5|Good Quality for a good price. Exactly as advertised and right on time. Will Definitely be back again, Thanks
B006Z8IS1Y|4|I'm a girl so I knew these would be big on me. The crotch is like a 1/3 of the length and I'll have to take apart the seams and redo them but they r comfy! also they r long.
B004Q6KWF2|5|I received them on time and like them very much!
B009SD8RS2|1|very cheap quality, washed delicate cyle, dried no heat 10 min.  threw in trash.
B00DTW4MU0|2|the problem is, about in this photo and offer it's not indicated this levis is clasic 501 NOT pre shunk! color, and the rest it's ok
B009SUWB2I|5|Very cute
B00H59VWJC|5|Love this item
B00GY4V3UW|3|Super cute, but runs pretty small. I ordered in the XXL size, which is usually either just right or a little big, and can get I on, but it's not nearly as long as it should be, nor does it cover any of the front of me. I wish I'd read the reviews first and got a size bigger. Maybe even two sizes bigger.
B00C3CHTE8|3|Cute bikini, but very thin material.
B00M9YY6UU|5|Very classy! My husband loved it and wears it with almost all his shirts!
B00GIFO4WQ|5|I am 5'11 and weigh 165 lbs. The LARGE barely fits me, and actually I can't wear a heavy sweater with the item without causing the coat to pull between buttons. That said, I don't often wear a heavy sweater and the jacket, for the price, is shockingly warm. Warning, the collar is really tall. I like it up when out in the weather, but have to fold it down when in the car, it will drive you crazy. For the price, this is a great coat.
B0063CAST2|3|I like the fit and quality, but think the neckline (like a half turtleneck) is too high and should just be a regular crew neck style.
B00KWIKO1U|5|Gorgeous, beautifully made, and a wonderful value
B00MNAS26O|4|Very cute outfit but the pants are too long
B00QMO7GXC|5|It was perfect and my Grandson loved the motorcycle on the back.
B00ESFDEX8|4|Good enough bra, I like the thick straps in back. The quality was kind of cheap- flimsy feeling. Other than that it's a comfortable bra.
B00HEZMQ38|2|smaller size and poor quality fabric..
B002SDCEZG|5|Could not be happier with these!  Great price, fit perfectly.  I am an 8-8.5 and I got an 8.  They were tight in the calf, but other fit fine.  Great for a party where you have to walk around all night.
B001C40Y0O|5|Great shirt- very much like the show. It is true to size and the color is exactly what the picture shows. My son loved the shirt and the feedback he got was great. ;) Gotta love The Office!
B009D8GQ12|3|very small but I bought it 2 sizes bigger so it fits as expected (I wear a slim US XL and I bought a XXXL), nice fit. the buttons are really ugly and their color is brown tortoise (on a steel gray shirt, really??!!), I had to order new gray buttons on line and change them... all 18 of them!!! lots of buttons on this shirt, too many. I wish there were no buttons at the tip of the collar it does not go with the rest of the shirt's modern style . Giving a 3 rating cause it's one of the few items in this brand hat comes in xxxl.
B005RRA44S|5|Outstanding
B00HNGWIJ0|5|great material. easy to use. gives me the chance to wear my non-nursing tops and feel comfortable.
B00DOX4BSW|5|This is a fun top which is also elegant and perfect for parties. I wore it with a black pencil skirt once and another time wit skinny black pants. I got tons of compliments.
B005PQPFPY|4|lighter weight material than I'm used to.  Will be great for the summer.
B005GNNXUU|3|loved this bra in creme color, so ordered more and all fit the same. Then got the black and it fits smaller, but don't think enough to get a larger size. So maybe it was just this one bra.....or maybe the black ones made at a different factory???
B0025L48IM|5|Great fit! Excellent item for its low price. I absolutely LOVE my goggles!! Can't wait to use it with my Gryffindor quidditch robes! :)
B00HQA1BC8|5|Beautiful shirt just as expected
B00H4669R6|5|Love the choice of tops
B00HN29OO6|5|Was a baby shower gift they lived it
B00D8XK39E|4|I'm 5'2&#34; and about 150 lbs.  The jacket came in and it was just about what I wanted.  A little on the big side but I need to layer anyway so it worked out, surprisingly warm (without layering).  I live in Northern Arizona it gets kind of cold, lows being in the 20's at night.  If your local weather temps are between 50 to 20, Id say this jacket could work for you, and if it gets colder you can always layer with the extra room.
B002JPJGUO|4|So my girlfriend got this for me about a year ago to surprise me on a convention trip. Its not great but the idea of it is to make a nerd's wet dream come alive so by the time you notice its not the greatest quality its already on the floor if you get what i mean. Like the top review said, if you pan on having a actual walk around convention costume, this isant a bad start to work off of compared to the other Rubie's products.
B00XMEA6UK|3|Nice shirt but a little snug in the chest area.
B008HBGVLG|4|I ordered these in a L because I figured they were stretchy. They are way too small & I can't even get them up over my thigh. I gave them to my 13 year old daughter & they fit her but they are quite short. Interesting material.
B0051MQZZQ|5|My son loves these warm ups, they are great for around the house or for his soccer practice. The fit was correct and he wears these all the time because they are very comfortable, his words not mine.
B00DCAWCXS|5|Some are really good fashion except for the skirt.
B00KO0H2GQ|5|it is a bit large but still looks good :)))
B0031U0P9M|2|The belt was missing the loop.
B0027WW14M|4|These briefs are comfortable, light, and flexible. They don't bunch up and cause discomfort like other briefs. you won't be disappointed if you purchase them.
B00NJ6M8HU|5|i absolutely love these...
B001OV92PS|5|great :)
B00CEHFRGY|5|I have a couple of desigual jeans which I bought in Europe a while ago - size 30 and 31; so I decided to order size 30 - they fit perfectly, true to the size.<br />The jeans themselves are awesome- embroidery is very nice and not too overwhelming - got a lot of compliments! I also received them in 2 days! Overall - great experience! Highly recommend!
B00PATJ7SW|5|Best top ever if you are busty, I've had a very hard time finding the perfect top. This one is supportive and I feel secure, but it is still cute. I like how the back adjusts. Great fit.
B00GIW8LP0|3|I like this shirt and will buy this same kind again. At the time I brought two different shirts for my husband and he has not opened this shirt. He thinks the color is to bright for him.. Came super fast and in perfect condition. Not sure If I will gift it or send back. I should have done the light blue one and still will in time.
B00JHVGNSG|5|Very comfortable.  Fits well.  Material is great.
B003KRQFNG|1|very large fingers couldnt reach to use it and it broke already too hard of plastic wrist strap didnt fit.
B004U0IRGU|4|ordered 1, daughter liked them so much got 10 more for everyone.  some don't work completely, some don't work at all, but 90% work completely.  would absolutely buy again.
B0009GDAA2|4|I do not like drawstring pants and I thought these did not have that but they did; otherwise, good quality, OK to wear.
B00UXVTS40|5|This hat/headband was great!  It is an awesome alternative to a traditional hat.  This was perfect for our derby party!
B001OGLGK2|1|I rated this item 1 star, because I have not ordered this item. There is no mention of whether the pants are pleated or not... I will not order until I know. Please correct this oversight.
B00NBCO38E|4|Nice.  Good quality
B00IB6RHHY|5|good
B005WSX8EU|4|Really nice material with a good look & fit.
B00K3LN2U6|5|Much better fit ordering the 8 instead of 10 (which I did in black).  I'm 5'4 and usually wear a 10.  Very nice trouser!!
B00TTDPR2K|4|Great!
B00L1C0VZK|5|Stylish, comfortable hat.
B00KEIX0TQ|4|It was a gift she liked it
B00Y2R0UU2|4|The shirt was nice quality but might be a bit big, however, that should not be a problem.
B00D09GNCM|5|This is a great coat..........I saw the same item on sale at Zappos for $134.95(seller don't raise your price) and the original price is $225.<br />Great price point on Amazon $69 and free 2 day shipping with prime membership.<br />I was not expecting the amount of detail and quality of this jacket.<br />The picture does not give you the full picture.<br />Your definitely getting more bang for your buck!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00JTLT7N2|5|All was great fits well love the color and the material thank you
B00KKUGFZE|5|Great product with excellent quality!
B00M87W7ZY|4|Leggins are somewhat small
B00NFGJ192|4|This jacket was beatiful! The only thing was I looked at the reviews and they said it ran very small so I got a XL and the size chart said I should fit in a medium , I got the jacket and it was a little big in some places but it still looks good and it looks like a big style fit. And I think if I ordered a Large it would have been small or uncomfortable. (Note: it is smaller in some places than others )
B004LZDF0W|3|This hat is just ok. Color is as shown, just a little lightweight. Not the hat you need for a freezing cold day. But it looks good. I think I could have gotten one for less off a street vendor of the same quality. Oh well.
B000QWA2I2|4|I like it but can't wear all day long in South Florida.  It makes you hot and sweaty and I feel like I get itchy skin from wearing all day long. I wish the material in the inside panel was some type of absorbent material instead of rubber. But over-all it makes my waist look slim.
B00FS2SL74|5|What can I say this top met the expectations caught a few eyes at the party and it went well with my gun coloured skirt
B004WY8MSC|1|I had to return these because they were so low quality. I know they are inexpensive, but the fabric is super uncomfortable and they look cheesey.
B00KIPFVTM|3|They are alright but I just have keep washing them to shrink them a little
B009UZE56G|3|socks are to thin
B00AEJPY8A|5|Bought these jeans for my son they fit great he likes them and they look great ! Would recomend them !
B001PU9A9Q|5|My wife bought these after purchasing some other nipple covers for use during exercise.  (She does fairly difficult HIIT workouts about 5 times a week)The others were cheaper but were inadequate.  These semeed pretty pricey, but she decided to get these after those failed miserably.  They've worked great.  She's a 34B and \\"perky.\\"  So at times, when she wears her workout tops, there is a little too much exposure.  These go on pretty smoothly and smooth everything out fairly well.  I did notice that it takes about 3-4 minutes of her body heat warming them up for the smoothness to  kick in.  But otherwise no issues.  The best thing is that they are reusable.
B000BGSBC2|1|Runs very small - 2x is more like a large.  Order larger than you think you need.
B00K5ATEY8|4|Everyone likes this shirt
B00ZAKOBAU|5|these are the best pair of joggers I've ever purchased, brilliant service<br />, thanks
B00GLZX1MW|3|Bought this in two different sizes the large fit well. The medium was to small with Amazon's policy no problem. Tried it on repacked and shipped it back NO hassle.
B005488AS2|2|These socks are not like the Tommy Hilfiger products that we have purchased in the past.  They didn't wear very well.  after a few washings, the ankle portion of the socks developed little holes... like the fabric was old.<br />Also the toes got holes in them... Again, not like the previous socks that he had purchased.
B0077L4C2M|5|These are a great pair of skinny jeans. They fit tight all day without bagging out at the knee. I will buy these over and over again!
B00BQLB0S8|5|The fabric on this is thicker than I expected for the price. The teal detail behind the skull is more vibrant than it looks in the pictures. I am 5'6'', 120 lbs, and I usually wear a small or extra-small in tops, so I went with the small here. The sleeves fit my arms perfectly, which was also unexpected because I have long arms and have a hard time finding sleeves long enough in a small. The sides have a nice drape, but it's too short in the front and back to be worn without leggings. The sides hit about mid-thigh on me. I'm fine with that, I bought it to be worn with leggings or skinny jeans. But if you're looking for something that will work without them, you may want to try a size or two up.
B00162OBE2|5|Great T-shirts - well constructed, nice fit, comfortable, stays dry in Arizona heat, durable.  Perfect.<br />Order delivered on time with no damage.
B00551OOHE|5|Fit perfect.  would buy again.
B00I0K61VE|1|Pendant was kinda smaller then iThought but it looks real nice, diamonds look real shiny, but the chain two thumbs down rusted like in 1-2 days poor quality chain.
B00QG9BSNW|5|Looks good although I have yet to wear it.
B003DHSE6O|2|So I got these for my bridesmaids. They feel very soft and warm, but when I took them out of the bag, they each had snags or holes in them. I also ordered the light pink and it was a lot brighter in person than in the picture. More of a bubble gum pink really. Thankfully, Amazon is great with returns, and I had no problems getting my money back.
B00EDY68UU|5|pretty
B0009KN2KQ|2|doesn't breathe; I gave it away after wearing it twice
B00HET0MXU|5|Nice!
B00K5KPPBE|2|Somewhat small, will see how it wears
B00FBFE212|5|was a gift for a Cena fun, they loved it a lot.<br />neat seller too.  Arrived promptly and the size was correct.  Recommend it.
B00E0KBCV2|1|Really too casual for anything other than around the house attire.
B00T569IGC|5|I love the material and the way it fit, also the color..
B0065L8OVK|5|Love the shirt, I bought it for my boyfriend for his BDAY and he wore it that same day! Love it Love it
B001F6PX4Q|5|The item was just as it was described.  The perfect light peach for my son's homecoming dance.  The only negative thing I would have to say is that when I contacted the vendor regarding shipping, they never responded back to me.
B00A3Q0DBW|5|Great shirt for Avengers Fan (kids)
B00827RQCI|1|Legs roll. Not fun. Maybe better for thin legs.
B001K3C09U|5|Perfect addition to any Napoleon Dynamite costume.  This fit over my 10 1/2 shoes, with no problems.
B008UDUK22|5|I love it so much that I purchased two.  It runs large, and I have to  stitch up the straps about one inch, but I am short, so taller people<br />It may fit perfectly on.  I often wear  this as a top layer, over a running bra and a midriff tank top, for more coverage.
B003KCW6I4|3|Bought large but when washed shrunk to almost a medium. Buy one size larger
B009FHN68M|1|The pajamas we ordered look used and don't look like the size we ordered.  We cannot tell what size they are though because there is no size tag.  Also,  the zipper came broke.  I have no receipt with the order and cannot find a way to return it.  Very unhappy and will never order this brand again.
B009CTU8EI|4|I have had these shorts before. I especially like the phone side pocket and the main reason of buying them again.<br />Would definitely recommend them to others of any size. too.
B005536DOO|5|Fit great and had a nice feel to it.  Didn't look cheap like the others I tried.
B00J4URZ00|5|PJ s were a hit, my daughter loves them!!!
B00HWNS4N8|5|Good afternoon costume is perfect and my son stay beautiful , plus the fabric is light and does not bother him at all , the model is different from those found in my area , I'm happy with the product,
B009ETVHJG|5|This is a cute little bit of couples jewelry for me and my (also a gamer) boyfriend, he wears the orange and I wear blue, they are cute and durable enough we have worn them most days for a few months now and they show no signs of wear. Fun little geeky accessory.
B00QVEYOLU|5|I ordered two pairs of these and love them but the only downside to these joggers are the pockets. The pockets are a little small so you gotta be a little mindful when your keys or phone is in there. In addition since the side pockets are small I have to put my phone in the back pocket and the weird thing is that there is only one back pocket on the right side. Great comfy besides those little gripes of mine.
B003J4B7EC|2|Not at all what i expected.  Luckily it was only $6.
B00AKSCLUY|5|This is my first time wearing compression short to do my morning run.<br />These fit comfortably and very light weight.<br /><br />You might want to be careful when wearing the color white. If gets sweaty, it's pretty transparent. However, I'm having the while color to be my boxer.
B00KBZQRMY|4|exellent
B006AEX8FY|2|The bones in my ears could feel the lining of the hat so I don't wear it as much.
B00D089IV6|5|The fabric is so soft...the design isn't childish....the colors are today.  Got rave reviews from the 12yr.old recepient.
B0058D1PU8|5|Bought one pack for myself and my grandma, they're super comfy and great for use as a sports bra. I recommend!
B009WZT8V6|5|Quality was great!
B003HMJPNQ|5|I love this little outfit.  This fits my sixteen month old perfectly.  He is on the tall side for his age.  It is a perfect fit for his arms and legs.  The green is really bright, almost neon like.  I love it
B007I0KWV2|2|This is Izod's 'Basix' line - aka crap.  Feels like it too.
B00KMQ424C|4|Great for work.
B00F1RN4VE|3|Love the top.
B006GJTW30|5|These do fit somewhat large, but the color and cut of these jeans are great!!
B007CX59DG|4|It looks nice and comfortable. My  kid is 3 yrs old and he's tall than his regular age.. This jeans looks fit for him
B00MUMMTIM|2|Waaaaay too small! The large fit my girlfriend... So just get the xl or possibly 2xl
B00H4TFO1U|5|very comfy.
B00KHRMETG|3|I like even though it's smaller
B00A0PZD0M|4|My shorts where one size smaller then I expected.They look real good tho. Seem to be nice shorts, hard to find shorts made above the knee line.
B004AZXO1I|5|Part of the ensemble I bought my wife for Valentine's Day, and she loves it, and I thought it was very fetching as well.  Reasonable price, great fit, and she looks incredible in it!
B00AMPXQ40|4|I ordered in pink for my granddaughter.  It is really cute.  I am going to order in black also.  Very pleased with purchase.
B00KCHIYPY|4|Love the length but somewhat small
B00H2W581U|2|The straps are not adjustable so they slip off really easily.  I had to tie knots in the straps to fit
B00CONNGVQ|5|Wow.  my waist is 35 inches so i bought a med.  it will take a bit to stretch to put it out but it was def the right fit... fyi. i simply LOVE this piece and will def buy the small one when the time comes.  i recommend this item to every woman!!!
B005DIEUUU|5|Worth every penny, they are double knee, and are great in cooler temps.
B00BPVBCZK|4|Perfect length and described as is and fit perfect!
B000PI66X2|4|I love sock monkeys.  I have sock monkey socks, mini sock monkeys, and now a sock monkey sleepshirt.    I got mine back in the Fall when they first hit the market.  Most people who know me will describe me as 'cold natured as a lizard' but this sleepwear was actually too warm to wear in autumn.      The shirt's great now in winter when the temps at night drop below freezing.  It's very cute and reasonably well-put-together.  My hem's coming out--which is the only mark not in its favor.
B00L78M732|5|Bought this to match my daughter's UV Skinz swimsuit.  Great quality and super cute!  The little ruffle adds girly charm and the adjustable tie makes for a perfect fit.  The brim is heavy enough that it does not fly up on a windy beach like some hats tend to do.  We also bought a coolibar sunhat but I like the UV Skinz much better because it has a soft tie instead of a velcro closure of the coolibar hat that can scratch the child or rub on the neckline of her swimsuit.  My 2 1/2 year old child has an average size head and the size 2T fits her with room to grow.
B00D3AWRYG|5|Sizes run pretty small as the other reviews state but the swim suit is extremely cute and I got it way before my expected delivery date.
B00LHQ40DO|4|Very Cute, good quality
B002KJSZLU|5|Nothing like American made Wigwams.
B00KHLN0KO|5|Super fast delivery, beautiful socks, great experience! Everypony should get a pair!
B00EW7P836|5|Great looking board shorts fit perfectly
B00IOEE3F2|5|Very good quality shirt....it's a bit heavier than the normal type of shirt...which I like !!!<br />It is good quality.....I've washed it 3X and it still looks brand new !
B00IMWXA78|4|My niece is in a 3t and this fit perfectly, she is so adorable in this. And it is one of her favorite bathing suits
