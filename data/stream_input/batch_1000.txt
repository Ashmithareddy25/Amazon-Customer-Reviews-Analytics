B001ER4CSO|5.0|I first have to say that I avoided Hell Boy for a number of years because most comic book movies frankly suck ass. But this movie really made me think about giving all of them a try, although the latest Wolverine movie made my case valid.     Having said all of that, I was blown away by HellBoy and this sequel is ten times better! Its funny, has heart and the action and special effects never stop. It's much more fantasy based, rather than just about hell and the end of the world stuff. It's a trip worth taking.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Just Fantastic and David Attenboroughs Narration just makes it so much better. Its a wonderful piece of art, the mix of creativity, time, determination, nature, and love for it all, made one of the greatest works ever. It really is a must see.
B0006GAO5Y|5.0|the shipping was fast and the movie was great. i will buy more things off amazon.     Thanks for the movie
0385333846|2.0|Have you ever gone to a movie and within a few minutes you just know it's not going to be \\"your type\\" of movie?  That's how this book struck me--it's just not my type.  From nearly page one, this book simply didn't grab me.  In the least.  Because it's a short book, though, I did finish it.  I kept thinking it must have a great ending or some kind of great over-arching message due to its fame and esteem, but it didn't have either.    It's the only Vonnegut book I've read so I don't know if this is how his style always is, but I did not care for the scattered back-and-forth in time approach--it wasn't that it was hard to follow, because it really wasn't, but I didn't feel like it added anything to the book.  Then again I thought the characters and events in the book were boring enough that if it hadn't had the time-jumping-around, maybe I would've not liked the book even more?  I guess at least the time-jumping kept me on my toes.    Largely I thought that the book was unemotional.  I didn't a lick about any character in the book.  Billy was just a sad sap, but I never empathized with him--and I don't feel the author ever tried to get me to empathize with him.  The other characters that came and went were pretty transitory and usually didn't stick around long enough to learn much about them.  There are glimpses into Billy's wife and family, and some of his soldier-mates, but they are mostly just glimpses.  I'm not even sure I know what BILLY'S character was really like--there just wasn't a ton of character development in my opinion.  Also the book struck me as one attempt at dry humor after another, and maybe that's just not my style of humor?  The \\"So it goes\\" and \\"Poo-too-tweet\\" repetition just annoyed me.     One unfair aspect to my reading of Slaughterhouse is it came directly after my first read of Catcher in the Rye.  I could not put Catcher in the Rye down--I connected with Catcher in every way that I did not connect with Slaughterhouse.  I thought Catcher wasabsolutely hilarious--I was literally laughing out loud on almost every page.  I wasn't expecting Slaughterhouse to be as good as Catcher, but I didn't expect Slaughterhouse to be so uninteresting and random.  I think Catcher was just more my style if you will.  (They're very different books--I'm not directly comparing them, just directly comparing my interest in them.)     Because I'm clearly in the minority in not enjoying Slaughterhouse, I'll assume \\"it's me and not you (the book)\\".  Nonetheless, I would never recommend this book to anyone--I would just tell them that most of the world seems to love it, but for me it wasn't the right fit.
B000267JQK|5.0|this cd is by far one of the best metal albums ever. i first purchased it at walmart but they neglected to tell me that they sold only censered metal cd's. thanks to amazon.com for providing the correct item. great service great selection great everything.
B001LYD2K4|5.0|Excellent re-mastering.  Excellent bonus tracks.  Excellent album.  This is one of the best hard rock/metal albums of 80's - and it's even better now with the remastering and great extra tracks.  This was a great purchase!
B00000JCB2|5.0|This album is over 10 years old now and their music still rocks! I just purchased my first Limp Bizkit CD after years of listening to their songs in various places, and do not regret it at all! Significant Other has to be their best CD out of all of them, as it hosts awesome songs such as Break Stuff and Nookie. Regardless of whatever haters might say about Limp Bizkit, they are one of the best bands ever formed and signed. And after being over 10 years old, these songs are still freakin sick.    I'm a rocker guy and like a variety of music, mostly alternative rock/metal. Limp Bizkit is just their own genre, mixing metal and rap together to create awesome beats and sound, and remains 1 of my favorite all-time bands if not my favorite. For anyone who dislikes limp bizkit and calls them \\"epic fail\\" or \\"music for morons\\" like I see in the Tag Suggestions below, are probably just a bunch of ICP juggalo idiots who need to get their diaper changed cause they just went poo-poo from crying over how much they hate limp bizkit.    Limp Bizzzzzzzzzzkit for life pl0x!!
B00376AWHK|5.0|I think the sound quality and separation of this remaster is outstanding. Crank it up; Paice's drumming sounds amazing. Much better than the remixed 25th anniversary edition in my opinion.
B001I5M9SC|3.0|This disc comes up when one searches \\"classical music blu-ray\\". However, it is not a classical music blu-ray disc. Rather, it fits into the \\"Pop\\" music category. As Mr. Bocelli is generally associated with classical music, potential buyers should be aware that no operatic arias are performed on this disc. I was expecting to find some, but I was disappointed with my purchase since I'm not really a pop music fan.
B0036XN2L2|3.0|I am happy that Klaus still has his voice but I have to say that the songs all sound to me like noise with the rare exception. Just too over produced. I have many of their other albums and expected more from this offering.
B00020HEL6|5.0|After hearing her sing on the TV show ugly betty I had to have this CD!!!  She is the best and would purchase any CD put out by her.
0307454541|5.0|Slow at the start. But really picks up momentum.  Well written and hard to put down at the end.
B000VUFJ3C|5.0|I have always loved the Backstreet Boys, since I just a young girl. Even now that I'm older I still enjoy their music. If you like their style you will love this CD. I would recommend it!
097747609X|5.0|One would have to be German to fully appreciate much of what Hitler had to state in his Mein Kampf, but over all, it is a must read for any racially conscious white person, especially one seeking the fundemental reasons as to why the U.S. Europe, and other predominately white nations find themselves in the political,social,and economic turmoil they are in today. Hitler reveals in Mein Kampf the Jewish origins of Communism, and one can clearly see and understand as a result of his losing WWII, how the related ideologies of Cultural Marxism, Political Correctness, Multiculturalism, Radical Feminism, and Diversity, has taken hold of our present societies which now threatens us with what Hitler feared most, and that was that the Aryan Bloodline,that which is ultimately responsible for any advanced civilization to be created and grow, would be destroyed by race-mixing, white low birthrate, and mass non-white immigration, all of which we clearly see happening today. The book clearly reveals the truth, that it wasn't National Socialism that was a threat to world order, but rather the International Jew, his political and financial control and influence, as well as his ability to control the media thus public opinion, all of which we also can clearly see today in our declining nations. National Socialism is explained as the only political and social system that can effectively defend against what Hitler identified as Jewish Bolshevism, and basically what our European/Americans are facing today.
0671027344|5.0|Let me start by saying, I don't normally enjoy books written in diary form. (Or in this case, letter form). But I did enjoy this. Within the first few pages we get a sense of Charlie, and who he really is. Charlie as a freshman, has so much to learn. And while he learns some things by just experimenting, most of the time he learns those little life lessons through watching and listening to people. This book had moments where my mouth gaped open. There were moments when I felt tears in my eyes. There were moments when I laughed. By the time I reached the end of the novel, I was crying. And I was speechless. I sat and cried and stared at the words. They leave an impact. I'd recommend this book for anyone, especially high schoolers. I think we all can relate to some/most/all of his experiences and thoughts.
B00003CXB4|4.0|I ordered this DVD because I love this movie and want to hear it on surround sound. it was damaged when I received it. Literally looked like someone may have stepped on it. Not their fault, that's shipping. Though the didn't have another. They did, however return my full purchase, shipping and all so that I could find another. The promptness of my return emails were very slow. In the end, the right thing was done however so there really is no room for complaints.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Modern Family is one of the funniest shows ever. I love these families; this show is perfectly casted, great chemistry between the actors, some of the humor and facial expressions are so subtle, which makes it even funnier. Very, very good show - I look forward to it each week and cannot wait for the DVD, this is one I will definitely have in my collection.
B003AXAS60|5.0|I bought a Cookie Dog for me (and I ain't no kid) and it was so darn cute that I bought another for my mom (and believe me she's less of a kid than I am).  I loved the big eyes and the super soft feel to this.  Believe me when I tell you that Ty Boo Cookie Dogs aren't just for kids.
B00275EGX8|1.0|I was expecting this movie to be amazing because of the awards it won, but after I watched it I coudent believe what a horrible movie this was. I have no idea how this garbage beat Avatar. I will never take those awards seriously again as I can now see they are just a bunch of BS. I suggest that if you really want to watch this garbage, to rent it or get it for under 4$ because no way its worth a purchase.
B000003NA4|5.0|As the title suggests all songs is about love and together with the fact that there is no drums or percussions in any of the tracks, the overall feelings I get throughout the album is mellowness and coziness. I like to sit in my favourite armchair with a nice cup of coffee while I listen to this.    Diana Krall certainly has an interesting voice, but I love it. All musicians in this album; Diana Krall on vocals and piano, Russell Malone on guitar and Christian McBride on contrabas, are very talented and their play styles complement each other very well.    The problem with the track selection, as I see it, is that there is too much of the same. After 13 tracks (my version features one extra track) I get rather sleepy. But other than that, the individual songs are great. The sound quality of the album is perfect. Every track is of the same volume and no instrument takes over another.    Finally, the booklet is great. For every song there is the full lyrics as well as rather extensive copyright information (composer, release year etc), which is for me as a statitics buff is helpful for organizing my music collection.    If you like jazz and especially mellow, smooth jazz, I highly recommend that you buy this album.
B00009Y3L4|5.0|I may be doing something wrong, but I didn't get any bonuses.  Also, I find the subtitles to be very disconcerting.  Is there any way I can remove them?
B001TK3XPE|5.0|I just read the sweetest book. David Lodge is a British novelist and academic. Some of his very funny novels deal with visiting professors who have affairs with other professors while visiting campuses across the Atlantic. But this book wasn't like that at all. Deaf Sentence is about a retired linguistics professor who is losing his hearing. He is happily married to his second wife and dealing with an aging working class father. The book is well written and lively and I'm not giving anything away here. Sweet is actually my best description for it. Lodge lets his protagonist get into realistic difficulty but he doesn't let bad things ruin him. I really liked that.
B00000FC5H|5.0|I am very pleased with my Earth, Wind and Fire CD.  Anyone who was a fan of them back in the day will surely appreciate this particular one.  It has all their great songs on it....my favorites anyway!
B000024D4R|2.0|Pink Floyd's 1977 album ANIMALS tends to be overlooked nowadays in the band's catalogue. Musically it sees them continuing the vein of progressive rock they established at the turn of the 1970s, but Roger Waters had now assumed a strong direction over the band that was to last until their mid-1980s breakup. For ANIMALS Waters conceived a concept album vaguely based on George Orwell's novel ANIMAL FARM, where the inhabitants of capitalist society are likened to either dogs (greedy, impulsive go-getters), sheep (their victims) or pigs (the authorities). ANIMALS dedicates a track each to their archetypes, the whole bookended by brief acoustic songs titled \\"Pigs on the Wing\\".<br /><br />The instrumental performances are often brilliant. In many respects this is Richard Wright's last moment in the spotlight. On \\"Sheep\\" his keyboards still provide a remarkable sonic backdrop that you can't help noticing. Soon, he was to be relegated to a minor role in the band by Waters (and his own drug habit). David Gilmour's rollicking guitar solo at the end of \\"Pigs\\" is memorable. But what undermines the album is the songwriting. Half of \\"Pigs\\" and \\"Sheep\\", and pretty much all of \\"Dogs\\", seems lethargic. So much of the album serves as a mere delivery for Waters' storytelling without any purely musical drive.<br /><br />I'm torn how to rate this. Sure, when I listen to it, there are some fine moments, but generally ANIMALS is one of the few albums in Pink Floyd's entire discography that I don't feel drawn back to. Even the last two PF releases, which have often been termed Gilmour solo albums, have more attraction.
032147404X|1.0|After purchasing a high-end digital SLR I wanted to get advice from pros so I would not be frustrated or disappointed. This was the first book I bought on topic, and will quickly go to the donation bin and another book will take its place.<br /><br />The author includes a few good hints, but nothing that really shows what you can do with even basic digital cameras. There are some situation recipes, but nothing satisfying about the exposure triangle - what I believe to be the real key to satisfying photography. The interspersed nuggets of wisdom are embedded in a writing style and humor that was offputting, so it left me feeling that I hadn't gotten a return on this purchase.<br /><br />I just read the back cover and it clearly says \\"User Level: Beginner\\" and that is a good caveat. Even with that, there is much more he could have included to tutor folks starting out on this hobby/profession. Read this in a library and put it back on the shelf. If you invest in a book, look elsewhere.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|As the title says, I'm not a huge fan of \\"metal\\", or at least, not in recent years and in the way it has evolved.  When I think of good metal, I think of things like Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Helloween or more recently, bands like Sonata Arctica.  For me, the vocals need to be good.  I can't stand screaming and Dethklok-esque vocals - I find them grating to the ears.  It's not my intention to slam that type of music, it obviously has its appeal.  My intent is to provide some insight for fans of rock that had their curiosity piqued after hearing this band on the radio.  In short - don't let the listed genre fool you.    I can safely say this is not a metal album that is packed with screaming or guttural mumbling.  This is also not an album that puts emphasis on the speed of the music just to prove their musicianship to us.  Though the band has experienced some commercial success over the airwaves - never is there a moment where it feels like they're pandering or even aiming for radio play (unlike some A7X outings)  This album, instead, is a wonderfully crafted piece of art.  It absolutely does something that most rock bands fail to these days - it creates an atmosphere all its own.  A dark, brooding atmosphere, but rather than aggression it's more like introspection and melancholy.  The lack of speed in the music is more than made up for by the WEIGHT of every note.  This music is heavy in a classic sense. \\"Crack the Skye\\" has a ton of personality and flows in such a way that it's hard not to feel immersed throughout the whole thing.  The standouts for me are The Czar and The Last Baron - combined, they clock in at about 24 minutes but you wouldn't know it if you weren't watching the track listing - these songs are epics.  There is not a single track I find myself wanting to skip through on this album, it seamlessly switches between great songs and feels almost like a concept album of old.    I may get flack for this comparison - but between the subtle, sometimes grainy vocals and the dark, brooding atmosphere, this album reminds a bit of Black Sabbath But in NO WAY is this a rip off, I'd actually rate this above quite a number of Sabbath albums.  And that gives me hope for both this band and for the metal genre.
B002UZCJP2|3.0|3.4 stars<br /><br />The only really good things here are the concept, Bruce Willis, and some colorful moments. But the script is no great shakes, the supporting actors are uniformly dull (Ving Rhames is B-grade as usual), and one gets the feeling this could have been so much more.<br /><br />Kind of a Blade Runner/Matrix/Brainstorm concept, the idea is great, and one of the best things here is the extra documentary. There are some interesting points made there that should have been explored in depth more in the film. As someone says in the extras, the telling thing is that we're already in a society where looking as good as possible is so many folks' ultimate goal; surrogates are a logical extension of that. But the many ripe possibilities are merely touched on, and I rarely say this but this movie is actually a little short! More time should have been taken to flesh out the many tertiary idas of the premise, and all in all it feels thinner than it should.<br /><br />But Willis plays the tough/tender guy, as he has since first arriving in Moonlighting, and he's as enjoyably believable as ever. He's still fun to watch and sells this movie when it needs selling. Still, the direction is fair enough, and all told I enjoyed watching this.<br /><br />Surrogates is no masterpiece, but if you want some light sci-fi/drama and like Willis, this should do the trick.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|bought this after renting it first from Netflix.  play it often and find myself even working out at the gym to songs from it on my ipod now.  only tried it out after seeing that Eric Clapton was a guest performer at the concert and was blown away.  Joe Bonamassa is arguably our Eric Clapton now, and the story of how he got to play at the Royal Albert Hall is very compelling!
B000002QWD|5.0|Bing Crosby IS Christmas!
B003A02W0I|5.0|Excellent.  This book kept me from sleeping.  I just could not put it down.  What a ending.  I never thought about this person being the cause of all the events that occurred.  This book need to become a movie.
B0021L8V1G|5.0|\\"Iron Man 2\\" is certainly a step up from \\"Iron Man\\". Where this sequel succeeds is in it's story. While \\"Iron Man\\" was a lot of fun, it was essentially 2 hrs of Tony Stark building three different suits and Robert Downey Jr. being witty. While it's not a terrible film by any means it's scope was rather small. With \\"Iron Man 2\\" we really get to open this world up and get to see who these characters are. We get a fully developed story with a couple different points of views. This is a great example of a sequel that can give the audience more of what made the first film work (in terms of action, effects, humor) and can also balance it out with bigger characterization, drama and more surprises. I thought that writer Justin Theroux handled it all very nicely in his clever script and director Jon Favreau (returning to the helm), does wonders with his fantastic cast. It's in that ensemble cast (that includes Robert Downey Jr, Gwyneth Paltrow, Sam Rockwell, Scarlett Johansson, Mickey Rourke, Samuel L. Jackson) where the film really connects. These are all extremely talented and charming actors working in top form. The acting does not need to be good for sci-fi films like this (which baffles me) but here the director and his cast are handed a script that breathes life into it's players and makes the proceedings all the more fun. Where \\"Iron Man\\" was a character study first and an action movie second, \\"Iron Man 2\\" puts both of those aspects front and center, making it mentally engaging and a hell of a lot of fun. \\"Iron Man 2\\" is better than \\"Iron Man\\" and certainly one of the more graceful sequels to cross the silver screen since \\"The Dark Knight\\".
B002WIDRM6|4.0|This is a great CD!  I never was really into country music that much, but liking it more & more.  There music is very good and I haven't stopped listening to it since I bought it.
B00371QQ2U|5.0|Ron Howard's Oscar winning \\"Apollo 13\\" is competently made in every aspect. Masterful cinematography by the now legendary Dean Cundey and flawless editing solidify \\"Apollo 13\\" as the American history classic it is today. With fine tuned performances from Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris and Kathleen Quinlan; brining an intensely human side to the scientific proceedings, \\"Apollo 13\\" is thrilling, inspiring and uplifting. Minus the hokey narration at the end, it's a pretty flawless film.<br /><br />\\"Apollo 13\\" is the anti \\"Armageddon\\".
0393072231|5.0|As soon as I finished this in only 3 days my immediate thought was \\"I have to read this again\\".    What a truly entertaining and enlightening post-mortem on the financial crisis. One of my favourite books of all time.
B00005JKC3|5.0|I actually really like Ang Lee's \\"Hulk\\". I find it fun, fast paced, imaginative and generally well acted. I really enjoyed the editing and the comic book-like transitions, it added a visual layer to the film that most comic book adaptations are missing. While it's not totally perfect: the plot can be a bit aimless and very little of the original story is included; it's still an above average adaptation. I appreciated that they took the time to develop the characters rather than just having all out action. I prefer this film to Louis Leterrier's hectic sequel.
B00005JNDZ|2.0|Ugh... Well acted, well edited, and I don't care to watch it. My wife loved this movie, and I bought it for her. She would give it a 5, but only give it a 2.     What do you expect? It is a chick flick. I do admit I enjoy Colin Firth and Hugh Grant having a fist fight. It has become a trademark when they are in a movie together.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Star Trek is one of those things that can have very judgmental fans. This movie did a fantastic job playing to the old fans while making Star Trek interesting to a whole new audience.  The actors did a phenomenal job playing their roles and the special effects were definitely a step up for Star Trek as a whole.  This product is also packed with bonus material to keep a fan busy for hours!
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I purchased this dvd for a friend who had seen bits and   pieces and wanted to see the whole movie.  She loved the  mnovie so much that she wanted to see it more than a few  times.  I am completely satisfied with the purchase and   have made lots of purchases from this company.  You will  be satisfied as well.
B0000027RL|4.0|This is a terrific album with hits that I'm sure if you were alive in the 90s and not living in a cave you've heard.  The production style is kind of rough and gives it a little bit of a live feel, which some people will undoubtedly like.  I personally prefer a crisper, studio sound, and thus I can only give it 4/5 stars.  Still a great album, and because it was to popular, dirt cheap to pick up used.  Well worth it in my opinion.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|The answer might surprise you.<br /><br />The film has been described as a rehash of old themes: chiefly, the collision of civilizations, the exploitation of indigenous peoples.  Yet I wonder if this is a bit like saying that music is just a rehash of  notes, or a book is just a rehash of the alphabet.  If it is fair, then it seems to me that the 'rehash' would have to include many other things, too--not only the young orphan deer vs. the thoughtless human hunters in, 'Bambi'--but also dreamer Roy Neary and scientist Claude Lacombe vs. the narrow minded Major Walsh in, 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'--along with Maria von Trapp vs. the Nazis in, 'The Sound of Music'--George Bailey and friends vs. Mr. Potter in, 'It's a Wonderful Life'--even  Joe Pendleton vs. the gangsters in, 'Here Comes Mr. Jordan' and, 'Heaven Can Wait.'<br /><br />As a science fiction rehash, one would especially have to ask: how many sci fi stories have had aliens come to earth taking on human form?<br /><br />Is this really a rehash of, '[[ASIN:B0002I832W I Married a Monster From Outer Space]]'?<br /><br />I can only say no.  Jake and Ney'tiri waking up together in the glade of the tree of voices is Bambi and Faline waking up together only to face man entering the forest once again.  Jake praying at the tree of souls is George Bailey praying, 'If you're up there, and if you can hear me...'  Following the subtext of the history of cinema, the old stories are the palette, not the painting.<br /><br />The innovation of this film is that we are the alien invaders--taking on alien form--; hence we are 'incarnations of Vishnu,' the Hindu god, or, in other words, the 'sky people' (sky people, since we are from earth--that is to say, from the aliens' point of view--from the sky): the 'avatars' (literally, 'avatar' means, 'incarnation of a Hindu deity;' Vishnu is the Hindu deity identified with the sky).  If you ask me, 'Dances with Wolves,' was the rehashed cliche.  This is something new.<br /><br />This innovation serves to underscore the objectivity of truth and beauty in an otherwise pure cinematic landscape; the story hinges on the main character, Jake, gradually responding to that objectivity.  With a jaded life and a crippled body he volunteers to be an avatar simply with a, 'what's in it for me' attitude--but gradually he comes to see things from a more encompassing perspective.  You see, that the avatars were needed to 'negotiate' with the alien natives was simply one of the theories of human beings. Apparently it was not true.  The planet welcomed not only humans but avatars.  It even welcomed its technology.  What it did not welcome were pirates who did not respect the order of creation.  The audience, siding with the main character--who at first plays both ends against the middle but instead comes to completely risk his position--also comes to side with the Na'vi, who live in what appears at first to be a horrific world.  Driving the point home are the characters Tsu'tey (a Na'vi) and Norm Spellman (a human), who each overcome an envy of Jake and ultimately come together to fight by his side.  The problem of nemisis Colonel Quaritch was that the only thing he could understand or respect about Pandora was its fangs.  The gradual shift from the initial impression of a horrific world to an impression of a world of immense beauty, is the most impressive thing about the film.<br /><br />I can't see how anyone would be inclined to believe that the would this movie depicts is factual, or where there is any expectation that the audience should be so inclined, e.g., to believe that there is a planet (more precisely, a moon) where the trees on it form a single and central nervous system.  What could be more clear than that this movie is pure fantasy?  But in this story--placed in perspective by understanding that it is a world of pure imagination--there is the strong suggestion, in the context of its plot, not only of rich treasures of truth and beauty inan alien world, but of a true religion which is also found there.<br /><br />If the avatar hero is an incarnation of Vishnu, then Princess Ney'tiri, I suppose, is his wife Sita (of the Hindu epic, the Ramayana); yet, if one prefers, perhaps instead, she is Eve, showing Adam--after he awakens from his slumber (Gen 2:21)--the tree of life (Gen 2:9), rather than the tree, 'of the knowledge of good and evil.'  When the Sigourney Weaver character, just before she dies, declares to the male hero, 'she is real,' she can hardly be taken as having decided that men do not have souls.  Does, 'she is real,' really refer to the trees?  It seems rather she is speaking of the place of human beings in the Na'vi religion.  The film does not propose any beliefs--it simply suggests that a planet in the universe might have a true religion on it--without denying the fact that the earth, too, is a planet in the universe.  I don't see how the movie is either New Age or anti-religious, any more than it is inviting the audience to worship an imaginary planet.  The film could have had historian of myth and religion, Mircea Eliade (in his better moments), as a consultant: &#34;No tree was ever adored for itself only, but always for what was revealed through it, for what it implied and signified.&#34;<br /><br />The film is certainly one of the best science fiction films ever made, well on par with the blockbusters since the 1970's.  The true place of CGI in cinema also seems secure: real actors for the living movement and expressions, computers for the sets and costumes--; it practices what George Lucas has referred to--in witnessing the film's production--as using computers for, 'digital makeup.'<br /><br />The story is very simple, even archetypal, but the movie is no less beautiful.<br /><br />A triumph for those who have a liking for the 'blue monkeys'--you know, those odd creatures of a nearby planet simply underneath some very unusual makeup--hardly unobtainium locked away in a Pandora's box.  They live on a planet that makes both the sky and the oceans look blue--when seen from a distance--but close up, the flora and fauna come in many hues, and the grass and trees are still green.<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />My review was based on the DVD.  Sorry to have missed this one in the theater, I now also have since seen it on blu-ray.  My only addition to the review based on the blu-ray is I concur that it is a visually stunning film, with much beautiful detail which does not appear in the DVD version.<br /><br />I do still rank the blu-ray, '[[ASIN:B000MRAAJM Planet Earth: The Complete BBC Series [Blu-ray]]],' as superior to Avatar.  But that is not to take anything away from this film.
B00005ABX0|5.0|i first bought smiley smile on cassette used for a couple of bucks at my favorite indie record store, yesterday and today records on bird road and loved it. played the cassette until it warped (a common fate sufferred by many cassette tapes back in the day) fast forward five years later(around 1999), i re bought the album in cd format as a twofer with another album of theirs i didn't have, wild honey.  wild honey is also a great album. both of these records are more of a back to basics sound for the beach boys as opposed to the lush arrangements demonstrated on pet sounds and today albums. those records are great in their own right but smiley smile has a bad rap with a lot of bb fans because it was replaced in lieu of the lost smile album. i love both, each on their own terms. as a matter of fact, i think i am partial to smiley/smile versus smile(which i also love). the bonus songs at the end of the c.d. are awesome as well. i highly recommend this purchase to anyone who love beach boys music and is ready to venture beyond just a 'greatest hits' compilation and pet sounds.
0307408833|4.0|I have a huge sweet tooth and learning that I have a wheat allergy was very disappointing until my sister gave me this book. I've made the chocolate chip cookies twice now. They make about 3 dozen so I freeze them and take them out a few at a time. They are totally amazing. Much better than the Gluten Free Betty Crocker mix I had tried before.<br /><br />It is true that not all the recipes are gluten free and I was a little bummed at first. But then I realized I would not have made any of them anyway. I do feel wording on the cover is misleading.<br /><br /> The ingredients are very expensive but that was to be expected because everything gluten free is expensive. I was glad that I could find all the ingredients at my local Harris Teeter grocery store. We don't have a Whole Foods or any of those types of stores nearby.<br /><br />Coconut oil was the most expensive ingredient I had to buy but you can substitute canola oil so I'll be doing that from now on(I missed reading that part before I bought it). You really do have to read the whole book to find different tips. Also, evaporated cane juice is sugar!! So don't pay major $$ for sugar with a fancy name.<br /><br />I saw that some people complained about the use of Bob's Red Mill Flour. I really didn't notice that it tastes different from regular flour. My cookies tasted great and that is all I really wanted.<br /><br />So far I am happy with this book and look forward to make the \\"fat pants\\" soon.<br /><br />*After reading a lot of the reviews (lots of negative ones)I feel like I need to include a few helpful hints so people can have great results like me.<br />1) Use canola oil instead of coconut oil if you are concerned about price.<br />2) If you do use coconut oil melt it in the microwave first then measure it. (This is no where in the book, but it is what you are supposed to do.) I melted it at 50% power for 30 seconds at a time until it was liquid.<br />3) Use dry measuring cups for all ingredients (even liquid ingredients!!)I'm pretty sure this is what everyone does wrong and it would definitely alter the taste and not in a good way.<br />4)Read the entire book before you even buy ingredients. Seriously. Otherwise you will miss a small, but important, detail that is not in the actual recipe. (I think this was a flaw in the book as well. I feel that if you need to know it then it should be on the recipe page.)<br />5)Follow the recipe closely. I read it several times before I started and it really helped.<br />6)All ovens are different. Mine cooks really fast. Yours may cook slow. So don't freak out if the cook time isn't exact. Stick a toothpick in it occasionally, when it comes out clean it is done.e does wrong and it would definitely alter the taste and not in a good way.  4)Read the entire book before you even buy ingredients.

B000ZM1MGE|1.0|I had heard about this movie a few years back and finally decided to purchase it.  I'm a huge fan of movies based on true events, as well as old movies.  However this movie was such a disappointment.  Only the last few minutes of the movie were interesting.  I wouldn't recommend this flick to anyone.
B0001K9IJ8|5.0|Music: 4 stars  Sonic: 5 stars  I like the sonic quality of this disc a lot, transparent and very well balanced. However, Diana Krall's singing is not convincing, lack of indepth emotional involvement.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|The Blu-ray Video and special effects were awesome!!!  I thought the story was weak and predictable.
B000XSWVEC|4.0|This movie was recommended to me by a friend when my daughter was in junior high.  She is a percussionist and at that time, wasn't interested in marching band at the high school level, but we wanted to see the movie due to her interest in drumming.  Since that time, she has gotten into marching band and an indoor drumline at her high school and the indoor drumline she participates in came in 14th at national competition last month (proud mom here).<br /><br />The first time I saw the movie, it really seemed over the top to me and while I enjoyed it, it seemed unrealistic in many ways.  This is a feel-good movie with a talented but arrogant under-priviledged kid getting the opportunity of a lifetime and showing how he responds.  I am always a sucker for this type of film.  The second time I watched this just this past weekend, I enjoyed it even more.  After going through a high school marching band season and an indoor drumline season, this all seemed perfectly normal.  The number of hours, the discipline, the hardwork these kids put into this are very accurately portrayed based upon my own experience.<br /><br />To sum it up -- a fun, entertaining movie that anyone who has participated in marching band (and drummers in particular) will enjoy.  The additional bonus material were great. Glad I bought it!
B002ZRPQ5K|1.0|I have been a fan of Keane since \\"Perfect Symmetry\\" and began purchasing their older albums/CD's and had been very pleased with their sound and style.  I respect any artist/group that attempts to push themselves into new territory. Sometimes it's a positive leap forward but in the case of this CD, it lands with a thud.  The first, unnecessary track, \\"House Lights\\" is a 20 or 30 second intro followed by a decent track called \\"Back in Time.\\" I became annoyed at the next track \\"Stop For a Minute\\" featuring  a rapper known as K'nnan. The material simply does not work and it was so annoying that I hit my forward button to the next song. K'nnan is also featured in \\"Looking Back\\" another sub-par effort.  Including the intro, the CD has eight songs, the strongest being the aforementioned \\"Back in Time\\" along with \\"Clear Skies\\" and \\"Your Love.\\" But this CD feels like it was made in a hurry to fulfill an obligation, and at just eight songs, it is still painful at times to listen to.  I wish I had went to iTunes or Amazon and selected the \\"good\\" songs and purchased them separately. I'm also glad I didn't spend a lot of money on this CD, but it was still too much at $7.99.
B000667GFK|2.0|Luis Miguel es muy bueno para cantar, pero realmente para este tipo de música no lo es tanto.
B00008YLV2|4.0|In October of 1993, in an effort to secure the Somali town of Mogadishu, Task Force Ranger, comprised of Delta Force soldiers and Rangers, are sent in for a mission that is supposed to last no more than half an hour. But when two Black Hawk helicopters are downed by insurgents with rocket launchers many of the members of Task Force Ranger are left stranded in the city. The ensuing battle lasts for 18 hours.    The Battle of Magadishu (also known as The Battle of the Black Sea, Black Hawk Down, and for the Somali's The Day of the Rangers) was both a disaster and a success depending on who you talk to. It was a success in that when all was said and done Task Force Ranger accomplished their main objectives. At the same time, it was a disaster because originally the mission was only supposed to take 30 minutes, but in the end lasted 18 hours and cost the lives of 19 American soldiers and somewhere in the range of 500-2000 Somali's. How do you adapt an 18 hour battle into a two and a half hour movie?    Very carefully, and had the movie been placed in a less capable director's hands than Ridley Scott's (Alien, Gladiator) this movie could very well have been a disaster. Ridley Scott, though, along with first time screenwriter Ken Nolan, do their best to capture the battle in a truly authentic light, and they do an amazing job. From what I hear (I have a lot more to learn about the battle) this is possibly the most accurate depiction of a battle ever put to film. I would also argue that it's the best example of modern urban warfare put to film as well.    The performances in this film are amazing as, despite a hugely recognizable cast (something I might just be saying because many of the actors in this movie have become huge since, and weren't as big at the time) there is no vanity amongst the actors. Their lack of vanity only adds to the realism, and also builds up the feeling of brotherhood as they act out the battle in the field.    All in all, if there was going to bean argument against this film it would really only be the fact that there's not much character development. In the end, though, it's not as much about the characters as it is about the units. It's not as much about the battle as it is a reminder that there are still soldiers that carry the DNA of bravery and brotherhood that we saw in the World War II elite. And it's not so much about Somalia as it is about the war fronts we fight on throughout the world whether in Somalia, Afghanistan, Iraq, etc. If you haven't seen this movie yet, definitely give it a shot.    4.5/5
B000FVE3BG|4.0|This watch does have the crown and control buttons on the left side of the watch, making it appropriate to wear on your right wrist if you prefer. But...it is not completely left-handed.     There are two control buttons, known as Button A and Button B. On the right-hand version, Button A is on the top and Button B is on the bottom. On the left-hand version, Button A is on the bottom and Button B is on the top. It makes sense from a design point of view. They apparently rotated the control mechanisms 180 degrees in relation to the dial face, rather than inverting them, to create the left-handedness. It still means the buttons are less useful for the left-handed person than the right-handed cohort.    The little date window is located on the same arc and angle as the 4 o'clock position, the same location as the right-handed version. It should be at the 2 o'clock position for the left-handed watch.    If you look, you will probably see that most left-handed watches will have these kind of issues of incomplete conversion from right-handed.    BTW, there are lefties who think that the clock should go around the other direction (counter-clockwise) for them. To me, that's nuts, but to each one's own.    Other than that, I love it. It is really nice to have a watch I can actually control without taking it off or looking very stupid.    Seems to keep good time (only had it a week or so), numbers are clear, very good price, delivered when expected.    It is a BIG watch. It doesn't bother me, but my wife is not quite sure she likes the size on my wrist that much. I told her that if she could find me a left-handed watch as good for the price, she can buy that for me. Nothing so far has met the criteria.
B002BFBAWO|4.0|James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg) has just graduated from Oberlin College with a degree in Comparative Literature, and is planning to take a month off to go to Europe before starting grad school at Columbia to study Journalism when he finds out from his parents that he will not have the money to go to Europe. So in an effort to make money during the summer before moving to Columbia. While there he falls for a free spirited girl he works with, Emily Lewin (Kristen Stewart).    Greg Mottola hit the big time as a director when he stepped up to adapt Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's script for a little movie that became Superbad for producer extraordinaire Judd Apatow. For his followup to that movie, Mottola decided to write a semi-autobiographical story of his life working at Adventureland on Long Island in New York. What was advertised was more of a comedy in the vain of Superbad, but what was delivered was a coming of age love story.    In reality, I think I am more happy now that I know that the movie is a coming of age love story rather than the raunchy comedy. The movie more or less defies convention, as it's main character, James, is a virgin not looking to have sex for the sake of loosing his virginity, but rather looking for his place. The fact that the main character isn't your typically sexually charged male nerd is, in itself, refreshing. And unlike most comedies of it's ilk, this movie is less concerned with punchlines as it is with developing it's characters. In the end, it's still the characters that make the movie, not the other way around.    The acting in this movie is great. Jesse Eisenberg, unfortunately seeming to be more and more typecast, still does the geek chic thing very well. Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig, of course being SNL alumni and at the top of the current class, bring the funny. Martin Starr plays the conflicted friend Joel, a character not far off from his character in Freaks and Geeks, while Ryan Reynolds gives a performance that is very understated for his typically more flamboyant style. Kristen Stewart was the real surprise to me though. For most of the movie she really seemed to be just swimming through, but toward the end it really seemed as if the character bared her soul, and she did a great job at portraying that.    If there was a flaw in the film, it wouldn't be with the film itself, but rather with the advertising that made the film seem like something different than what it is. In actuality, that advertising short sold the film for those of us that would have been more interested in the actual finished product. I highly recommend this film for anyone who likes dramedy's and if you like movies that really let you into the film characters lives.    4/5
0143038419|1.0|We tried to read this in my book club.  It was almost unanimous.  We all got throught the Eat part and thought it was fine. The Pray part was painful and only a few of us were diehards and ended up reading the Love section or parts of it.  I don't understand why this book is so popular unless it is the title and cover. It was one of those books where I thought of all the other great books I could have read while I was wasting my time reading this one.  Too many books, too little time to read this one.
B002PMV9K6|5.0|I recieved the dvd in very good condition and in a timely manner. this was however not my favorite film in the series. I felt that it was not as ingrossing as the ones before. If I had not read the books several times, having the seven, I would have thought it very good, but the direction and screenplay were short of the books energy.  I was really looking forward to the scene of the fighting inside Hogwarts. that was hardly even referred to!  a big disappointment. did not have the same magnetisim of the other films. I have them all so far and recently I took a Saturday to watch them one after the other, that is when I realized that it was not me it really is a lower caliber film than the others.

B00069A5GE|5.0|What can one say about Mark Knopfler that hasnt already been said? A master musician, a guitar god, one of the most revered songwriters of our time.....all these aptly describe his attributes as a craftsman weaving tapestries from imagery so vivid, and a soundtrack so poignant - Sailing to Philadelphia wonderfully bridges the gap between the \\"Delta and the Tyne\\", and the end result is a masterpiece.<br /><br />Not that he really needs any more accolades and acclaim, but it would seem a travesty that this was not nominated for a Grammy. If you enjoy the finer things in life, you owe it to yourself to listen to this CD on your best sounding equipment. From the epic title track to the evocative Prairie Wedding, each song tells a story and draws you in - the fact that this is now available in 5.1 surround sound makes the experience all the more enjoyable. Subtleties are now just a tad more present, vocals and guitars all the more crisp and clear.<br /><br />This record is the genuine article, and it comes highly recommended - even to non Dire Straits fans!
B0021L8V1G|4.0|It won't be long until there are hundreds of reviews up for Iron Man 2, many of which will say the same things but here's my take.  I won't go into a plot synopsis (there will be plenty) but will point out where it succeeded and where it missed.<br /><br />Success - Tony Stark.  Once again Robert Downy Jr. IS Tony Stark.  Part jerk, part nice guy, eccentric (I don't like people handing me things), a genius and totally self absorbed. He's such a flawed and human character - this part of what makes him such a fun character to watch.  What other hero puts on his super suit and gets drunk (OK aside from the Comedian).  It's so fun to realize most of his problems are all his own fault.<br /><br />Miss - Pepper Potts.  I liked her in the first movie but I didn't see any development here.  She seemed static and a bit of a whiner.<br /><br />Success - Hammer.  Stark's rival and replacement weapons contractor to the military.  Calling Sam Rockwell's character the anti-Stark has already become clich&eacute; so I'll just say that he was fun to watch and fun to hate.<br /><br />Miss - Rhodes.  I didn't think Don Cheadle brought any more to the roll than Terrence Howard and I never really believed in this supposed strong friendship between Stark and Rhodes.  I didn't hate him or love him he was just there.<br /><br />Success - Whiplash/Ivan.  Mickey Rourke plays this villain in an understated way.  No big theatrics or speeches (no monologueing) just an attack on the man he hates.  And seriously if there is one man I do not ever want to be on the bad side of it is Mickey Rourke.  And kudos to the movie for not feeling the need to name every villain and character.  Imagine how easily it could have turned into camp if he'd busted out on the track and yelled, \\"Call me Whiplash!\\"  Plenty of other movies fall into this trap of feeling they have to name the villain.  Dude, we know who it is.<br /><br />Success - Black Widow.  I was really unsure about her inclusion and the casting but it all turned out really well and Scarlet really brought it.  Her action scenes were smoothly executed and not too over the top.<br /><br />Success - War Machine armor = Awesome.<br /><br />You'll notice a trend above that these points have to do mostly with the characters.  That's because they are all so much fun to watch interact for the most part - even the miss ones are elevated by the success ones.  For example a big fight between a drunk Tony and a mad Rhody, both in armor, is a highlight.  I will admit that there are long stretches of no action but in those stretches is *character development* which is nice so we care about what happends during the action.  When the action comes it is great.  I will admit that the final action piece did not cause as much tension as the first one though - I didn't quite feel the danger like I had during that first battle.<br /><br />It's easy to look at this cast of characters and fear that the movie will be come an overloaded mess (Spider-Man 3, Batman and Robin) but it doesn't which is an achievement in itself.<br /><br />There were copious amounts of Avenger foreshadowing going on.  Someone is getting excited at the studio.  There are lots of little winks for the fans but I could see it being overlooked by the non-fan.<br /><br />Are there plot holes?  Yeah, a couple.  But nothing disastrous and I'm sure there are bits on the cutting room floor that would have plugged them.  For me it was when the heck did Tony decide to install an independent arc reactor in the Mark II?  But then it was hinted that maybe he wanted Rhodes to take the suit.<br /><br />It is a very fun and worthwhile movie so I'll be crossing my fingers for IM3.  You know some studio exec is going to step in and try to overstuff it.  Stay strong John Favreau.ht it.  Her action scenes were smoothly executed and not too over the top.

B0028K3192|5.0|This is a beautiful album! I love it from start to finish. Each song carries its own personality. No two songs sound alike. It isn't one of those albums that you only want to or end up listening to the songs released to radio. All the tracks are appealing. I thoroughly enjoy the instruments that can be heard vividly in each track. In a world of Autotune, it is pleasing to hear authentic instruments. One of my favorite tracks is \\"Phoenix Rise\\". It is the ultimate example of how the instruments used truly come alive. I was thrilled to read that Maxwell will release three albums by this title. Ingenius! The second will be BlackSUMMERS'night and it is anticipated to be released in summer 2010.

I had finished reading Liars Poker, and bought The Big Short, a couple of weeks ago, Lewis is able to take a subject that's not particularly engrossing and makes it interesting, and understandable.  One of the interesting things I got from both books though is, in Liars Poker which took place in the eighties, everyone was talking about millions, In The Big Short less than 20 years later it was billions.

B002VPE1AW|2.0|I loved Avatar, so I went out and pre-ordered the DVD as soon as I could.  As soon as the package arrived, I ripped open the box and put it in my DVD player, eager to watch all the special features and directors' commentary and all the other goodies that I was sure James Cameron stuffed into his masterpiece.    Only to discover that there are, in fact, none of these perfectly standard features on the disc. No commentary, no features, not even trailers. This is the reason we buy DVDs now instead of renting. If I only wanted to watch the movie, I would go to Blockbuster. I shelled out extra money because I wanted something extra in return. Then they turn around and ask me to buy the special edition coming out in a few weeks. Yeah, thanks, like you've earned my trust.    James Cameron and Fox spent a quarter of a billion dollars on this movie and made it all back thanks to fans like me, then gave us all the finger with this lame DVD.
B001HN694K|5.0|Tumble down the rabbit hole with Alice for a fantastical new adventure thanks to Tim Burton. This is an imaginative new twist on the Lewis Carroll classic in which Alice, now 19 years old, returns to the whimsical world she first entered as a child and embarks on a journey to discover her true destiny. This is a Wonderland unlike anything you've seen before, with characters more colorful than ever, from Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter to Helena Bonham Carter`s Red Queen to Michael Sheen's White Rabbit. This is a Disney flick, but it's like some drug-induced dream that will feed your mind and your soul. Those who want a less flamboyant and less colorful (as in black-and-white) experience can opt for the 1933 live-action gem starring W.C. Fields and Cary Grant. A word of warning: Universal Home Video hurriedly released this flick to cash in on Burton's Alice adventure; this is the edited 77-minute version, not the complete 90-minute version, Still, W.C. as Humpty Dumpty and Cary as the Mock Turtle are (almost) worth the trimming.

0307588335|5.0|This book is amazing, I was so hooked! I learned more about financial crisis from reading this book than a whole semester in business class. Larry laid out the issues really well and it was very easy to comprehend. This book helped me out BIG TIME on my business report. It was like my bible for my project! I learned a lot about the collapse of Lehman Brothers. There is so much interesting insider information, things that my business teacher didn't know about and most importantly, they are information that I can't find on Google!     This book deserves a 5 rating! It's a MUST read for those who want to understand the issues on Wall Street and big companies like Lehman Brothers.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This is a review of the Blu-ray not the movie (per se), but I'm sure I don't have to convince anyone reading this that the movie is brilliantly done.  Terrific comic book story done as a gritty, realistic, and often terrifying tale of morality, corruption, and the choices we make.  Heath Ledger deserved his posthumous Oscar for making the Joker a true figure of evil, as it is not enough for him to be evil himself and do evil, but he must prove everyone else is as evil as he is by placing them deliberately in situations where they have to make impossible choices.  \\"Die a hero or live long enough to watch yourself become the villain\\" says Harvey Dent (Two Face) who sadly lives up ton this passage.  For as hyped as the movie was, it was till underratedn and delivered in every respect.  Bale is superb once again. Gyllenhall is a fine replacement for Katey Homes (did anyone actually miss her?), Eckhart is heartbreaking as Dent.  Gary Oldman (cast against type) is a remarkable everyman hero in the story as Gordon.  Ledger (aided by the brilliant screenplay) does not make the Joker another over the top, try hard to be entertaining villain...He's a true Boogeyman.  Terrifying, sadistic, and utterly beyond all redemption.  \\"The Dark Knight\\"  lets good and evil have a lot of shades of gray.  Unlike the recent \\"Avatar\\" which  never takes the risk of letting it's characters occupy middle ground (a lazy exercise really).  In Avatar, the baddies are bad and the goodies are good.  There's no room for characters to make choices, making for s story far less involving.  \\"The Dark Knight\\" has us more involved in the story than the effects or technical elements.  That's where the movie's longevity as one of the greats will come from.  \\"Avatar's\\" will wear off after the technology is exceeded and we are left to reconcile the story.    Now for the BD cut.  The standard dvd was a darn handsome transfer with a ribust soundtrack.  This high def version is stunning to behold.  Crisp, detailed, razor sharp imagery.  The colors and blacks are inky and fully saturated.  The change between IMAX and 2:35 is awesome and makes the film more of an experience.  There is no digital noise, aliasing, halos, or banding present.  Blacks are beautifully rendered and never crushed, which is quite something given how dark the movie is.  The sound is a pulverizing Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  The bass is foundation shking, with exhilarating ambient and directional sound effects.  Dialogue is crisp and never muddled.  Simply put...this is a perfect transfer and demonstrates how amazing the technology is and what it can do to make a movie a new experience.
B000UYX4OK|3.0|There's something to be said for making a movie by placing real actors and real objects in front of a real camera with real film loaded in it. In this respect, \\"Beowulf and Grendel\\" easily exceeds Robert Zemeckis's largely CGI \\"Beowulf\\". If nothing else, Hrothgar is a believable Danish ruler, rather than a vinyl Stinky Pete, sans pickaxe.<br /><br />The script -- which has a great deal of intentional humor -- never forgets that \\"Beowulf\\" is an Anglo-Saxon tale, and peppers the dialog with F-bombs and S-bombs -- not to mention the C word. Selma (a character not in the original tale) asks Beowulf why he hasn't made a snatch for her c---. Despite this, there is almost no sex -- the principal sex scene being Grendel ravishing Selma. (Yes.)<br /><br />Which brings us to the \\"reworking\\" of the original tale. The Zemeckis version is tolerably close, but \\"B&G\\" strays far afield, with Grendel now the revenging victim of the Danes' violence. Still, as silly as it all is, the overall /effect/ is not half so silly as the Zemeckis film, which is why I've given it 3 stars. The Blu-ray transfer is beautiful, and allows one to savor the magnificent cinematography. Not to mention the bearded, long-haired eye-candy. Beowoof!<br /><br />Performances are generally okay, with the notable exception of Sarah Polley. She was a wonderful child actress (\\"Baron Munchausen\\"), but her \\"performance\\" here is wooden and amateurish beyond belief (and beneath contempt) -- it wouldn't be acceptable in a high-school play.<br /><br />Now that Gerard Butler has played the king of Sparta, Atilla, and Beowulf, perhaps it's time he assayed Gilgamesh. One problem, though -- Gilgamesh and Enkidu start off as woman lovers, but when they meet each other... well &lt;ahem>. It's hard to figure how \\"The Epic of Gilgamesh\\" could be \\"reimagined\\" to cover up /that/.<br /><br />PS: Don't confuse Geatland with Greatland, Target's line of outdoor gear.
1401307787|5.0|I first saw him saying in videos available on the web and thought it was pretty nice. The poem of Derek Walcott's, 'Love after Love' that he introduced almost in any lecture was very thought-provoking. It touched my mind deeply, when it said,\\"There will be the time when, with elation you will greet yourself...\\" The words \\"with elation\\" expecially touched me. And then I read this book. It was an experience that went deep into my inner being.<br />But I suppose that the mileage will vary widely depending on how well seasoned you are to understand the meaning of the words. If you are famililiar with Buddhist or some oriental traditions and culture, you will appreciate the reading a lot. Those quotes from Thoreau, Li Po, Kabir among others, gave me totally different understandings than before I read the book. I had read 'Walden' but I did not get the meanings or his intentions back then when I saw the words like \\"Only that day dawns to which we are awake.\\" What is interesting is that Dr. Kabat-Zinn's book almost automatically makes me introduced to a fuller meaning of the quotes, allowing me to respond, 'oh..why didn't I know it before?'<br />So personally this book was one of those life-changing books that helped me go deeper with the meaning of my life.<br />Thanks a lot Dr. Kabat-Zinn.

0393072231|5.0|THE BIG SHORT: INSIDE THE DOOMSDAY MACHINE surveys the current global financial turmoil from the perspective of the winners in the scenario, following a small set of contrarians smart enough to see how mismanagement and predatory lending policies would soon bring the financial world to is knees. They were willing to bet money on the bust - and so they boomed while establishments fell. This provides a powerful survey of these individuals and how they prospered and is a 'must' for financial and social issues libraries alike.
0307454541|4.0|I'm so angry that his companion of 30 years will not get the money, it is a complete recreation of the victimization of women that he was so against in this book. An utter tragedy, had I known, I would NOT have purchased this book and added to the pockets of a family he didn't have contact with. They sound filthy in articles, asking her to say \\"yes please\\" to the paltry amounts of money they want to settle with. Could we boycott these books, pass your copy along so no more of them will be purchased and simply get them from the library, either as a download (The first, girl with dragon tattoo, is available at my library as a download though you must put it on hold first) or as a regular old book. Uhg, it just makes me sick. I'm going to make sure my copy comes with instructions to pass it along, wish I hadn't given his family my money.<br /><br />It was a fun fun fun read, it made my one hour train rides much to short!
B003ELKNOK|5.0|Bon Jovi's \\"Slippery When Wet\\" is easily one of the top five albums of the 1980's. There is absolutely no filler at all on this record, and it's fair to say with out this particular album, Bon Jovi may have never made it huge.<br /><br />In my opinion, \\"Slippery When Wet\\" is Bon Jovi's finest hour. Some fans may argue for \\"New Jersey\\" or \\"Keep The Faith,\\" and in all honesty those records are awesome, but this is where it all started to click for the boys from New Jersey. Bon Jovi took their song writing to a whole new level on this album, and couple that with the huge production, it's a winning formula for sure. My favorite tracks from the album are \\"Raise Your Hands,\\" \\"Livin' On A Prayer,\\" \\"You Give Love A Bad Name,\\" \\"Without Love\\" and \\"Wild In The Streets,\\" but the rest are strong just the same.<br /><br />I highly reccommend this record if you do not already have it. It seems hard to believe melodic rock fans wouldn't have this gem, but hey, who knows. Another note about this release is, Bon Jovi re-released this album in 2010 with extra tracks, the \\"extra tracks\\" are all just live versions of already released songs, so i'm not really sure how they're anything extra.
B002VPE1B6|2.0|After failing to have watched this movie in theaters, 19.99 for the Blu Ray/DVD edition seemed like a good deal, considering nowadays going to local theaters -- for two -- runs me 40-50 bucks easily.    Still, it's not worth that. I agree with past reviews that the special features should have been included. The fact that they were not makes this set of standard (DVD) and HD (Blu Ray) discs so much more boring. At the same time I do have to ask, what the director could possibly have to offer me that has not been said before in Batman, Lord of the Rings, etc etc about the effects and the film/story itself? Not to much, I am afraid, until the release of the 3D edition enlightens us to the technological secrets of \\"3D TV\\" from a studio's perspective.    The movie was nothing out of the ordinary and exactly what I had expected for myself: blah! \\"Blah\\" seems to be the underlying theme and blah is what I took out of the endless struggle not get up and walk away/around during the showing in my home theater setting. Come on already, Native American themes and philosophies? I asked myself whether this was a hollywoodesque approach to a philanthropic popularity newly arising post-Costner in regards to Native Americans. Have we not Danced ourselves through the Wolves back in the 90's? The movie, and this is obviously my opinion, would have much benefited from the studio doing its homework in another native tradition, of which there are many of lesser known regions. Give me Africa, give me Laotian, give me the Philippines, but give me something. Give me something outside of \\"Mother Earth\\"; how about \\"Mother Ocean\\" -- I will take what you have to offer.    Essentially, I was disappointed in the been-there-done-that aftertaste of the movie's theme as well as the predictability of the story.
B003BVK2ZS|3.0|I found this book just okay. In short, the characters are not very interesting. Yes, I didn't expect to like a man, Mr. Gilkey, who steals books, but I did expect to find him intriguing. He wasn't, partly because his thefts were so simple, partly because I just couldn't empathize with him, as he had no clue about the difference between right and wrong, and didn't, therefore, make any attempt to control his compulsion. Mr. Gilkey seems like a empty sociopath who, in the end, I had no interest in. Yes, Ms. Bartlett tries to give him depth toward the end of the book but, I suspect, there just isn't depth to give. Somehow, I never experienced nor understood his love for books.<br /><br />The books' second major character, Ms. Bartlett herself, seems more like and observer and reporter than an in-depth character who changes and grows as the story progesses. Maybe that is too much to ask for on my part, but I feel her character should be more of a counterweight to Mr. Gilkey's.<br /><br />On the other hand, the book is a well-written, easy read; and because I love books, I'm certainly not sorry I read it.

B000FIMHJ4|5.0|Released in 1988, &#34;Open Up and Say....Ahh&#34; would top the Billboard 200 charts and catapulted Poison to the top of the rock 'n roll world. Poison would soon be linked with just about every single negative thing uttered about the pop-metal genre, but man, these guys were a monster talented hard rock band. Poison embraced the sounds, looks, and nihilism of the ‘80s party rock lifestyle maybe more than most, and quite frankly, that's why I believe that they have endured while others have vanished.<br /><br />&#34;Open Up and Say....Ahh&#34; is an absolute perfect example of what made the ‘80s hair-metal scene so popular. The majority of the songs on the record could have been radio staples, and even the so-called filler tracks are pretty easy to like. Of course, the reason everyone remembers this album is the monster power ballad &#34;Every Rose Has Its Thorn.&#34; The song shot to number one and solidified Poison as one of the decades biggest musical acts. There are, however, a few songs that may make others want to hit the skip button, but tracks like &#34;Fallen Angel,&#34; &#34;Love on The Rocks&#34; and “Your Mama Don't Dance&#34; are second-to-none.<br /><br />In 2006 the record was finally remastered and re-released with an amazing sound and expanded liner notes, and it also comes with some bonus content to boot. You get an unreleased song in &#34;Livin' For the Minute,&#34; as well as a 10-minute interview with the band from the late 80s. My only quip with this album is I wish they would have included other rare tracks like &#34;Face the Hangman&#34; and &#34;Rock 'n' Roll all night,” but I guess you just can’t please everyone all the time.
1439148953|3.0|Yes, this was ALMOST a great book, but what a let down with that ending.  A very unsatisfying end to what was otherwise a good story.  Now, if there was a sequel in the works, this would be an altogether different review, but without any hope of finding out what eventually happens to these characters, I was disappointed. What a shame.
B0028DRGDQ|4.0|So Quarantine is not an original film huh? It's a redo or REC. I guess i shouldn't have been shocked, oh well. I watched this and felt like I was watching Quaratine but in Spanish. Yeesh, if your going to redo a film from another country, at least make it a little different no? Rec was good and the final creature at the end was way cooler looking. I really don't know what else to say. I should just copy what i said about Quarantine and paste on it here. Seems like a lot of movies now are either remakes of films from other places or from the 1970 or 80's.<br /><br />I don't know when REC 2 came out, but i found copies of it at Toys n Joys. I watched it a few hours ago with my friend. It takes off right from the end of REC. It's good and scary with a surprise return person from REC.

B001QOGYBI|5.0|The Fantastic Mr. Fox combines some of my favorite things: Wes Anderson, talking animals, Jason Schwartzman and superb art direction. The first time I watched it, I was unabashedly charmed. The second time I watched it, I picked up on all the little quirks that are the hallmark of an Anderson production (such as the word \\"cuss\\" filling the void for expletives. While George Clooney and Meryl Streep were standouts, I instantly fell in love with Ash because, well, we share some of the same characteristics (I'll just leave it at that.) This movie is so wonderful, I purchased an extra copy for my 4-year-old and 25-month-old nephews. The older was entranced, and has begun to learn how to whistle à la Mr. Fox, himself. I've even found myself using the word \\"cuss\\" on a regular basis. Also, I have deep love for hard apple cider, so I was sympathetic to Farmer Bean (just a little.) As for my my nephew and me, we are still trying to learn whackbat.      P.S. Soundtrack is great for young and old, alike. Highly recommend it, as well.

B001LF4IA6|2.0|It's so sad for me, a fan of Bruce of many years, actually decades, to see him slide into mediocrity with albums like this. Seriously, does Bruce think that anyone is going to like this album? He doesnt sing, he whines; the lyrics are substandard, silly; he doesnt make the minimal effort to sound energetic. Besides, almost all the songs on this album sound the same, mid-tempo dull ballads with no real melodic hooks. And alas, in \\"Outlaw Pete\\" he even stole the melody from a disco song of the band Kiss, where it sounds similar to \\"I was made for loving you\\". I love Bruce, he was the soundtrack of my life for so long, but honestly, he needs a better producer and a new shot of creativity. There are of course, a couple of decent songs here (Working on a dream and My lucky day) and one outstanding, a la par of Bruce's classics, The last carnival, a song that he made in memoriam of the late Danny Federici, who died recently. Why is that song good? Because Bruce sings with real passion and he wrote it in the same way that he wrote his early albums: with the heart. Bruce.... raise your standards!!!
B0035G9ABQ|4.0|There's a lot to like about this CD, but not as much to love, as in a great single, like Feel Good Inc or Dare. And where there are opportunities for a great single, the tracks are not as fully realized as the aforementioned songs from Demon Days. But in some ways, this album is Gorillaz' most majestic, most epic effort, even if it lacks a truely infectious single. I think Superfast Jellyfish could have been developed a bit better, but then again I'm a fan of Gruff Rhys (Super Furry Animals) and De La Soul (from Feel Good Inc). I am a fan of the Lou Reed track, even though I can see why some wouldn't be (I can count all the Lou Reed songs I like on one hand, this being one of them). Its one of those juxtapositions I come to expect of a Gorillaz project. Its the same reason I liked hearing Gruff Rhys and Snoop Dog...their vocal delivery is pitch perfect for Gorillaz. But in my opinion, their talents are under utilized. That being said, its the missed opportunities that prevent this from being a 5-star rating, instead of just a 4. Even though the guests here are the most divergent I've ever seen on a Gorillaz album, its still a very cohesive release. And even though there's no single the rival of Feel Good Inc or even Clint Eastwood from the debut, I give it a 4-star rating for what it represents, an entire album as artistic statement in an era of downloads and singles.
0385333846|5.0|Unlike most novels, \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" begins with an introduction that you have to read.  That is to say, most introductions are interesting and informative, but if you skip them you haven't really missed anything.  Not this one - if you want to read the novel, you are required to read the introduction.  That's just the way it is.<br /><br />I'm pleased to see that Kurt Vonnegut is now receiving the acknowledgment due him as a great American writer, and indeed received at least a part of that acknowledgment during his lifetime, but not as much as he will over the next few decades.  That's one reason you have to read the introduction.  Another is that Vonnegut's reputation rests primarily on a series of interconnected novels he published in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" is the last and probably best of these.  And finally, you have to read the introduction because it explains how and why he came to write the novel, and pretty much gives away the whole point of the piece.<br /><br />Under ordinary circumstances we would probably say that if we already know the point of a novel (or anything else), there's no reason to read it, but this is Kurt Vonnegut, remember.  In addition to everything else that was unique about him, he loved to talk to his readers, in person or in print.  You certainly read his novels because they're great, but you read them at least as much for the opportunity to hang out with the guy.<br /><br />Not to rehash the whole business, introduction or novel, but as the opening line declares, \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" is primarily about a man named Billy Pilgrim who has come unstuck in time.  He does not experience his life in a linear fashion, like you and I do.  Rather, he jumps around from event to event in his life randomly, and may find himself in any place or any period at any moment.  Which would be fascinating in and of itself, and made all the more so by the unbelievable things that Billy has been through, including the moments before his birth and after his death.<br /><br />You get to be with him as he works his way around Europe during World War II, eventually being captured by the Nazis and imprisoned, like his creator, in Dresden, just in time for the Allied bombing of the place.  You get to be with him during a perfectly normal upper-middle-class postwar lifestyle where he becomes an optometrist, marries the boss's daughter, prospers, and survives an airplane crash on his way to a convention.  You get to be with him when he's kidnapped by the alien Tralfamadorians for observation purposes, which is not as bad as it sounds when you consider that his captors are kind to him, teach him a great deal, and provide him with a companion in the form of a gorgeous adult-film star named Montana Wildhack.<br /><br />And you also get to be with him as he comes to realize from the Tralfamadorians that everything is eternal and immortal.  The aliens don't go through time in a linear fashion either, but unlike Billy, they are constantly present to every moment of time, from the creation of the universe to its destruction.  This is how Billy can be present on Tralfamadore with his gorgeous mistress and on Earth with his devoted wife both at the same time, and why he attempts to teach the world that nothing is ever lost.  He doesn't succeed, of course, but one of the best things about \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" is that his failure doesn't bother him in the least, exactly because nothing is ever lost.<br /><br />Now, in some ways, this is kind of depressing, since it implies that the universe is going to go the way it goes no matter what we do, but Vonnegut's deliberately simple style somehow turns it into a comforting doctrine.  And that's the final reason you have to read the introduction.<br /><br />In it, as I said, he describes how he came to write \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\".  Briefly, he wrote it in this particular manner at least in part because of the wife of his old Army buddy, a man who hadlived through the bombing of Dresden with Vonnegut.  This woman worried that Vonnegut would make war sound like fun, and thus make children like hers want to go out and fight and die.  She needn't have worried - I can assure you there is nothing fun about war as presented here, although it is kind of amusing when Billy encounters a couple of characters from Vonnegut's previous books.  The important point, though, is that the author structured his book to not only claim, but demonstrate, that nothing is ever lost.<br /><br />One way he did this, and the most obvious, comes at the introduction's end, where he points out that \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" begins with the line \\"Listen: Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time\\" and ends with the line \\"Poot-tee-weet?\\"  That's his transcription of bird song, a sound Billy hears at a rather horrible moment.  The sound reminds him once again that no matter how dreadful life can get, the birds still sing, and their song, like everything else, is never lost.<br /><br />So in his introduction, Vonnegut brings the opening and closing of his novel together and shows us what it can teach us.  And now that you know that, you still have to read the introduction.  You have to read the novel, too, because there's more in it than just that.  I'll let you find it for yourself.  I'll tell you one thing, though; Vonnegut was a master prose stylist, and in \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" he found a style that matched his theme just about perfectly.  And that's rare enough that I can't allow you to miss it.  So what are you waiting for?  Go read it!<br /><br />Benshlomo says, Every word from the mouths of the wise is like gold.his woman worried that Vonnegut would make war sound like fun, and thus make children like hers want to go out and fight and die.

0142410314|4.0|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a lighthearted Cinderella fantasy about a sweet little poor boy who is one of five lucky children chosen to tour Mr. Wonka's mysterious chocolate factory. This factory is the topic of much speculation, since no humans are ever seen going in or out, but it remains the source of the most delectable confections known to man.<br /><br />The children and their parents discover that the factory is populated by funny dwarfs called Oompa-Loompas, and each room is filled with candy more delicious than the last.  Throughout the tour, Charlie's good character (an effect of good upbringing by a loving family) strikes a contrast against the four spoiled, unpleasant children, who continually get themselves into hilarious trouble by misbehaving.<br /><br />The story is wonderfully well written, and although it is lighthearted in tone it is a true moral tale -- probably too moralistic for some readers.  Charlie, like the traditional Cinderella, is almost too sweet, and the four bad children are ludicrously obnoxious.  There are some intense moments: Charlie's family lives in danger of starvation, and in a few episodes the reader is left to wonder whether the bad children will come to real harm.  Parents ought to use discernment when introducing the story to sensitive readers.  And, of course, candy is a central motive, highlighted by Charlie's real hunger.  Those who are sensitive to sugar or given to gluttony may want to avoid the story for this reason.<br /><br />Aside from these points, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a rollicking, lighthearted fantasy, full of humor and imagination, which is a delight to read aloud.  If parents decide to let their children watch either of the movie version, I strongly recommend they read the book first, because the movie interpretations are quite different from the spirit of the original story.
B002RKRUEA|4.0|I love history, philosophy, and religion.  This book covered all three subjects and kept my interest.  It is not often that you get a philosopher emperor to write down his thoughts, but this is what happened here.  You have a man who by all accounts was a great leader and a good man and we get to see what was important to him and what his underlying assumptions were about life.<br /><br />His values are quite universal.  For example, he values self-mastery, and doesn't like complainers.  As an engineer, I enjoyed hearing about how he thought things worked.  Many are out of date, but several are what we would consider accurate.<br /><br />I got a better feel for Stoicism from his discussions and it helped me understand how the Romans thought prior to adopting Christianity.  He did make a disparaging comment about the Christians; he thought they were fanatics that didn't work well with others.  I noticed from history that he was involved in their persecution in Gaul.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in philosophy.  It got me thinking and sparked more interest in Marcus Aurelius.

B002T9H2L0|4.0|...which I've always been too lazy to do until now.   I'm not a QT fanboy - I've never seen any of his other movies - and I'm not a huge fan of Brad Pitt, either, but this is an extraordinarily memorable film. I have to respectfully disagree with those who say it's \\"nothing but gore.\\"  There certainly are some gory moments and children have no business seeing this film.  Too, some parts are distractingly campy: the \\"spaghetti western\\" theme music that backs up some of the scenes, or the comic-book graphic that introduces a cut-away to the background of one of the \\"Basterds\\" come to mind.  The sporadic fits of \\"camp\\" and gore are why I only give it 4 stars, when it could have been 5.    Nevertheless, while those nits detract from the rest of the movie, it's still a worthwhile film.  In particular, the opening scene between the SS Colonel (played by Christoph Waltz) and the French dairy farmer (played by Denis Menochet) was magnificent.  Indeed, it makes this movie worth seeing all by itself.  It could be an Oscar-winning short all by itself. I have sometimes wondered whether I would have had the courage to hide Jews from the Nazi's during WWII, and why more people didn't.  But this scene.... My best description of the way Colonel Landa deals with Messr. LaPadite is \\"chillingly amiable.\\"  It is truly horrifying without depicting gratuitous gore.  It was simply brilliant.     Ironically, given the title, the only scenes that I didn't completely enjoy 100% of the time were the ones with \\"the Basterds\\" (although I did like Brad Pitt's line about \\"the worst thing about fighting in a basement....\\"  Also, his horrible Italian accent made me chuckle.)  As others have noted, and I consider it fortunate, most of the film is about other characters.  Indeed, the movie is really about Shoshanna Dreyfuss and her torment (deliberate and inadvertent) at the hands of the Nazis.  The scene between Colonel Landa (again!) and Emanuele/Shoshana is especially well done, and her reaction after Landa leaves was flawlessly played. It is their stories and the interplay of their characters that make this movie so very good.  See it!

B0013FSL0C|4.0|\\"In Treatment\\" is an extremely underrated series that shines and displays amazing originality. An intriguing HBO series that has both; an overall theme and underneath it lies a brilliant underlining storyline that is never viewed with restlessness. This might not be for the action-packed, police/murdering, or mystery suspenseful audience but is extremely close to the reality of dealing with conflict/trauma using the tools of psychoanalysis. Not your typical \\"shrink\\" program.      Introducing and delving into the human psyche. A mid-level psychological series which often catches and releases the viewer to ponderous questions of one's own consciousness. Storyline mainly involves 5/6 diverse characters with different but relative challenges. Follow characters through weekly sessions of discovery, denial, challenge, betrayal on their wayward heroes' journey, along with many twists of coincidence...or is it fate?       Script is well researched and character development is extraordinary. Mia Wasikowska (Sophie)(Alice in Wonderland) establishes herself as a young 5 star actress who very well may be the best up-an-coming young actress I've ever seen in a television series, Gabriel Byrne (therapist) is flawless within duality roles of not only providing therapy but as a conflicted human. Melissa George (Laura) has the best script of character development on the show and has no problem playing the love/sexual transference witnessed with real-life patient/psychologist relationships.      Why 4 stars and not 5...Season 2 is taking way to long to release on DVD.
B001993Y2C|5.0|Someone recommended this show to me a few months ago so I decided to pick it up. My preconceptions of it was all based on the awful name of the show, so I never thought to watch it. Plus, all the SciFi channel makes is Stargate or B-movies.... but they insisted it was awesome.    So this particular BluRay version is cheaper than the DVD set. Why? This version has awful packaging. And it's not so much the packaging that ticks me off, it's the lack of a pamphlet explaining what episodes are on what discs. I watched \\"Pegasus\\" twice in a row... first I watched the regular version and then I watched the extended. I didn't do this on purpose, I was just putting the discs in and pressing play. I didn't realize that that is how they put in the extended versions of episodes.    Still, this was the best scifi series of television ever, no question, and it's just amazing television period.     If you're looking to watch it, I wouldn't waste the extra 60 bucks on the \\"better packaging\\" BluRay. The point of the blurays isn't the packaging, it's the show itself, after all. Just be aware that there is no list of episodes and deal with the packaging you get here.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|Hypocrisy, malice, and corruption.     Abuse of privelege, power, and responsibility.      This couldn't possibly describe the government of the German Democratic Republic.     If the East German press was to be believed, the people of the GDR were the luckiest people on earth. They were the envy of the world - they lived in an idyllic paradise under the caring and (ever so) watchful eye of \\"President\\" Erich Honecker and his State Security apparatus, the Stasi.  So good was life in the GDR that it was a catastrophic tragedy when the Berlin Wall came down in 1989. Countless millions of \\"true\\" Germans in that moment lost everything.     But that is propaganda.  The truth is that in that moment, the only people to lose anything were those in power.  For the countless \\"Ossies\\" who worked quietly against the regime, the fall of the Berlin Wall was the moment when these unsung heroes gained everything.    We now know (to the everlasting shame of Western Socialism/Liberalism) that life in East Germany wasn't at all like the State's press releases.  Life wasn't a paradise of endless choices; instead, a person born into the GDR was given only two unenviable choices: \\"play by the rules\\" and lose one's soul or fight against the inhumanity of the regime and most likely lose one's life.  In either case, one could expect the Stasi to be intimately involved.    \\"The Lives of Others\\" is a movie that focuses on a writer, an actress, an interrogator policeman (HGW XX/7), an opportunistic civil servant, and a pig of a government official. The movie describes \\"Operation Lazlo\\" (\\"OV Lazlo\\"), a surveillance operation that takes place over approximately six months.  \\"OV Lazlo\\" is a corrupt operation from the start and it is the moral bankruptcy of the operation that over time causes HGW XX/7 to truly see what he had been so patriotically, though robotically, defending.  At great risk, HGW XX/7 decides to take a stand, though small it might be.  In the end, and at great loss to the writer,the actress, and HGW XX/7, the interrogator policeman's actions result in the eventual restoration of their dignity and courage.    \\"The Lives of Others\\" is a sublime masterpiece. Having served on the East German border during the Cold War, I can attest to the cruelty and blatant lies of the GDR's propaganda machine.  \\"The Lives of Others\\" gave me a glimpse of those unsung heroes (like HGW XX/7) I always hoped were there.  It is no longer a hope, I now know they were there doing what they could.    Was kann ich sagen? Sie sind der wahre Held des Kalten Krieges. Ich möchte Sie irgendwann treffen und Ihre Geschichte hören. Ihre Stimme verdient, gehört zu werden. Bravo!
B002JH3TW8|5.0|This item is a bit pricey for what it does, which is connect my older iSight external camera to the newer style firewire port on my newer Mac.  It is of course somrthing that probably cost Moshi pennies to make, sold to Amazon for $10 and Amazon sells for $20.  If you can find it cheaper, buy it.  All this said, at least I can say that it does work.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I was excited to get this dvd, thinking it was genius the segments were only 20 minutes long. Her program is effective. It is great dynamic exercise that combine cardio and strength together, but it doesn't seem long enough for those regular days. It was too fast paced for me to go beyond the modified versions of each pose in each level, and the next day I didn't feel sore like I wanted to. Maybe it's just that I like those longer, slower, more controlled exercises. If you like high intensity, bursting tae-bo like workouts, this might be for you. This would be great on days where you don't have a lot of time though. I did find it a little disappointing there was a lack of variety in the 3 segments (beginner, intermediate, and advanced). Also, one annoying factor of this dvd is the beginning where she is talking and you can't skip it. Not bad, but not the best imo.
B00328G4V6|5.0|I am not sure what the people who gave this luke warm reviews were expecting or why they bought the album. If someone asked me if I wanted to sit on the studio floor while Jimi played some extended loose jams on Sunshine, Red House, Fire, etc. - hmmm - I think I might tend to say yes. With the clean, warm sound on this cd, that's exactly what it feels like. The takes bring something completely different (less focus but more \\"groove\\") to the originals, and the unreleased songs are a nice addition as well. I hope if there is more of this lying around, it will see the light of day.
015206396X|5.0|This is a wonderful read for all ages, well, most ages there is some sexual content and defenitely violence. It has fantasy, romance, and best of all action!!!! Kristen Cashore wrote an amazing book and I am looking forward to the companion books, Fire (already read and is JUST as GREAT) and Bitterblue!!! I waited a long time to read it because the cover and back made me think it was too \\"fantasy\\" for my tastes, but I picked it up at school one day because I had nothing else to read and I was hooked within pages!!!

0812550706|1.0|I bought this book and read it on the recommendation of a co-worker who insisted it was the best book he had ever read. I read the story and quite frankly was bored the entire time. I never got truly interested in the character's developement and saw exactly how the book would end long before it actually did. Would I recommend this book? No.
0920668364|5.0|I have given this book over the years for everything from births to deaths.  It reminds us all that a parent's love knows no end.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie. It's not for young children but a really good watch for everyone else.
B000DZIGDU|5.0|Seeing all these negative reviews here gives me a wedgie. I just saw this all the way for the first time since I was returned from my alien abduction. It's really something that will always stick with me. Kinda like the implants in my neck and thigh. Unless they give me another memory wipe for bad behavior (I kissed one of their be-tentacled slime daughters), I will remember this always. FART LOCKER, on the other tentacle, was a gay-wad fakeout. This movie makes FART LOCKER look like a greasy turd. Thank you.

1597801577|4.0|The Windup Girl is the first book I've read in 20 years to take me to a world I haven't been to before.<br /><br />I don't want to give too much away about the story, so let's just say the backdrop is: Peak oil has come and gone, empires have fallen and all energy is created by calories.<br /><br />I would however, like to talk about the characters a little.<br />Here you are treated like an intelligent human being by the author, and presented with characters that transcend the usual one dimension. Each has her or her flaws and you need to work to overlook their character defects to get to know the real person; there's no simple \\"good guy\\" and \\"bad guy\\".<br /><br />Also, there isn't really an obvious main character. Why does there have to be? It's refreshing to read something that strays from the norm and instead focuses on a bunch of people struggling to survive. If you really want a hero, just judge them for yourself and pick one.<br /><br />The best thing about this book for me was that it reminded me of reading books for the first time when I was a kid, when every world was new and every story an original.
B000F4RHB6|4.0|As a greatest hits package goes, this one is very enjoyable. It includes a few tracks that were supposedly omitted in other Huey Lewis collections such as \\"Back in Time\\" from \\"Back to the Future.\\" Sound quality is very good, and for even a casual fan such as myself, almost every track is recognizable and great fun.
B000002HGD|4.0|Moby's 1995 contribution to the world is a mixed bag of delights and mystery.  \\"Hymn\\" introduces one to this collection with an almost hyper piano melody on steroids.  It certainly fits into the `hymn' or a `song of praise' category, but feels repetitious despite its pleasant feel.  Then the listener is attacked with nasty punk grunge-like selections of songs like, \\"Feeling So Real\\", \\"All That I Need Is To Be Loved\\" and \\"What Love\\".  To be fair, these are perfectly good punk rockers.  \\"Let's Go Free\\" and \\"Bring Back My Happiness\\" are probably the most confusing techno-pop I've heard in a long time.  They seem like experiments rather than songs.  And just when you think all is starting to fall away, the listener is treated to mellow melodic trance-inducing mood songs like, \\"First Cool Jive\\", \\"Into The Blue and the truly original \\"God Moving Over The Face Of The Waters\\".<br /><br />While Moby could never be fit into any one specific category other than \\"maybe\\" techno-pop, his creations are always wildly imaginative.  This collection is a keeper simply for so many of its unique creations on so many different levels.  Moby also always keeps you guessing, as in the instance of the title track, \\"Everything Is Wrong\\" which seems so very ordinary, plodding and slow.  But then he finishes the album with one of his most beautiful songs ever.  \\"When It's Cold I'd Like To Die\\" is an amazing, romantic piece of music with instrumentals that flow through you like calming waves and a vocal that rivals Annie Lennox.  This song is alone worth the ownership of this album.  Moby can be a genius when he wants to be.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|I love this movie, besides being a sherlockian for many years.<br />There isn't much in the way of special features with the \\"reg\\" DVD issue.<br />why is it all on the blue-ray version and not on the other?<br />i don't need the blue-ray version & am perfectly satisfied with a bunch of special features on the \\"reg\\" DVD version...*if* it had it.<br />is there any chance a special edition will come out, that is *not* blue-ray, with lots of extra features (as plenty of other movies have done so)?
B00005JLKB|3.0|I've been watching Smallville Season One while exercising. It's built on a great premise -- the Man of Steel before he grew into full superness -- but the show is extremely flawed. It does have some good parts: the character of Clark, his friendship with Lex Luthor, premonitions of Lex's future menace, and the sweetness of the Clark/Lana relationship. But some parts of this show are just too stupid for words. Let's start with the writing. The dialog is so cliched that you can predict it, word for word, at least 30 seconds before it's spoken. And the plots are just insipid and embarrassingly similar from show to show: pick a random Smallville-ite and give him/her a kryptonite-fueled power that just happens to be an ironic twist on their personality. The guy who gets angry easily? Give him fire. The bug-lover? Turn him into a bug. And wait... we had a fire guy, so how about a cold guy next? And then a bee girl!  It's a rogues' gallery of the pathetic, going beyond \\"comic-booky\\" (which could be fun) into plain stupid.    Now let's talk about characters. Chloe is the worst, a limp attempt at a \\"Willow\\" character from \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\". No matter what the situation is, no matter how little evidence is around, Chloe instantly leaps to the correct, implausible solution (\\"Hmm, that girl MUST be controlling the killer bees by emitting a queen bee scent.\\") It's as if she has a direct mental channel to the script. Then there's Pete, a character so insubstantial that I couldn't even remember his name after a dozen episodes. Continuing the \\"Buffy\\" analogy, he's the Xander character, but Xander was actually witty and charming. Pete is barely noticeable: we're supposed to believe he's \\"Clark's best friend\\" but he doesn't actually do anything remotely interesting. The rest of the characters (Ma & Pa Kent, Lionel Luthor) are played like stereotypes: not bad, just unoriginal and predictable.    But perhaps the worst aspect of the show is its complete lack of suspense. In every episode, you always know who the bad guy is from the very beginning. Given that Clark is invulnerable and the main characters aren't likely to die, you know how every show is going to unfold and end. Add in the cliched dialog, and the plot just evaporates. To compare with another \\"super-teen\\" show, \\"Buffy\\" succeeded in this domain because the characters were strong, the dialog was clever, and the plots had surprising twists, even when the vampire parts got dumb.    There is the occasional flash of brilliance, like the episode with the rogue cop who blackmails Clark (thankfully, no kryptonite-poisoning in sight) and when Cassandra takes Lex's hand to see his future. Other than these rarities, the show is barely watchable, even painfully bad sometimes. I give it 3 stars for being just enough to take my mind off the treadmill.  (I stick with it because I'm curious to watch Clark & Lex mature.)
0671449028|5.0|This book is short, but very, very cute.  I know it will be a favorite book before bedtime. (we read quite a few short books)
B0002XVQNU|2.0|I love superhero movies, but Daredevil is pretty mediocre. The character is much more violent than in the comics too.
0385341008|4.0|You will laugh through your tears as you read this book.  It is delightful. I couldn't give it five stars because I felt misled by the reveal when Sidney visits Geurnsey and never had a flash of anything. I definitely wasn't buying it nor the ending.  If not for those two events happening in current time, I would have given it a 5-star rating!  There are so many stories from WW II, this book illustrates that, as well as how reading can transport us and change us.
B001O80G60|1.0|Love Pantera.  Love the album. But be aware this download does not contain the original song \\"By Demons be Driven.\\"  Instead, there is some sort of bad remix of the song which doesn't even compare to the original.  Amazon, this needs to be corrected or at least noted somewhere so buyers are forewarned.  If you want the real original album and one of the best songs, download this from somewhere else.

030745455X|5.0|If you liked the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, you will also love this book. But, do read these books in sequence. While this story did not develop the relationship between the characters as well as the first, the story is suspenseful and Lisbeth proves to be almost super-human. This for a character who is punk, bi-sexual, does not relate to other human beings well, and probably has Asperger's syndrome. What a fascinating combination of attributes in this puzzling, strange, and wonderful young woman.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|For an \\"vintage movie\\" this was tastefully done and showed \\"love\\" through the years and how time affected their lives. This movie made a person think about how two people \\"were together apart\\" through being married to someone else. Good movie!
B002T921AC|1.0|Back in 2009 i was listening to the radio and heard one of this kids songs. without adding any gross details---I wanted to throw up my pickup truck's driver's side window!! I know i am not going to be liked for this---but this is the way it is the music biz of today. I have never in my life heard such whininess in my life---with the exception of that whiner Taylor Swift, who i wouldn't listen to if even if someone paid me to. when i hear this kids songs on XM or the radio, i immediately turn them off and listen to BPM or something---in short anything is better than this kid's 'music'. What is the big deal about this kid anyway? he's NOT even good looking. I have never seen girls go as crazy over a guy like this since Michael Jackson---that is disgusting. these girls are crying over this kid---i have never seen anything like it. my favorite artists are *NSYNC and Justin Timberlake---call me old school but they are WAY WAY WAY better than this whininess that this kid is spewing. *NSYNC and Justin Timberlake(is)were and still are the best of the best. Where is all the talent nowadays? What happened to the *NSYNCs, the Justin Timberlakes, the Whitney Houstons, and the Susan Boyles of the world? Instead of hearing that true talent, we're now stuck listening to this? This is just as bad as listening to Madonna or Britney Spears. This is what happens when you leave the door open for anyone who thinks that they can sing to come in---when they can't do anything of the sort. This kid sounds like a whiny little girl and he can't sing at all. I don't no what Usher saw in this kid, but i think he must have been imagining things or more likely that he saw  $$$$$ written all over this whiny, talentless kid. I am a fan of 90s music and this is nothing of the sort. I wouldn't recommend this album---not that its even worthy of being called an album---to a dog let alone a person. these songs are all mediocre and so superficial---all on the surface and they have no deeper meaning. Allof these songs are the same---and unlike *NSYNC's and Justin Timnberlake' music---the songs do not vary in meaning, lyrics, or beat. These beats are all phony and made up to sound catchy. This stuff will make your ears bleed and make you want to throw up. There is no real talent out there anymore---unless you count Justin Timberlake's collaborations and his albums. I am just very sad that the music biz has gone this far down hill. I'm sure that this kid is just a fad and he will disappear just like Sarah Conner did in 2004. This kid is so whiny he makes my ears hurt. These songs are nothing like the slow, but emotional song from Justin Timberlake Until the End of Time or like the rapid, upbeat song from *NSYNC It's Gonna Be Me---both is which have a deeper meaning than is on the surface of the song. These songs don't even strike up any emotion and they are not memorable---only if you count that this 'music' makes you want to throw up. I am a HUGE *NSYNC and Justin Timberlake fan, so i wouldn't listen to this album even if i was paid to listen. This kids 'music' makes me sick to listen to it. I'm sorry, but talent is no more in this country. Now Justin Timberlake is a real singer and has genuine and real talent---along with *NSYNC as well---they were and still are the best of the best in the music biz!!! This kid couldn't shine Justin Timberlake's shoes nor could this kid hold a candle to Justin Timberlake either. Now Justin Timberlake's a singer/songwriter, producer, fashion designer, stunt devil, collaborator, etc. Now what has this kid got to show for himself? that he has to whine to get attention? is it just despicable what our kids are listening to these days. If you want to give your kids something to listen to, something that is not too old for them but it is still mature and not for little, little kids, if they are between the ages 12 and 15, give them an *NSYNC cd. the songs are just fun and the boyz of *NSYNC have actual talent that only comes around once in a lifetime if that. give *NSYNC/Justin Timberlake a listen before you slam them. you can't tell me that this whiny garbage is better than *NSYNC or Justin Timberlake. i know that for a fact cuz i have all of their albums and listen to those albums all the time and better yet those albums and that music never gets old no matter how many times you hear and listen to them. This kid doesn't even know what talent is. and when he tried to sing Cry Me  A River by Justin Timberlake, it was terrible. If he wants to know what real talent is, he had better take a page from *NSYNC's book---not that he can even come close to *NSYNC's talent, of course.  And give him a break because he's 16 years old? give ME a break. this 'music' isn't r&b this is whininess and ear-splitting torture. He wanted fame and fortune, now he's got it and he should be judged in the public eye on talent just like any other artist his age and older(except for Justin Timberlake because he has actual talent and he is the best of the best in the solo category---*NSYNC in the group category). I will just let all of these other girls buy his albums and i will stay content with *NSYNC's and Justin Timberlake.  Go *NSYNC!!!'s albums  Go Justin Timberlake!!! We need(and want)you guys back!!!  C'mon boys save us from this torture to our ears!!!

030745455X|5.0|In \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" Stieg Larsson created the most memorable fictional character since Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch. His Lisbeth Salander is golden. She is a goth punk Clarice Starling & a heckuva lot more intriguing.<br /> If \\"...Tattoo\\" left its mark on you then this 2nd book of the \\"Millenium\\" series will burn right through you. This is great crime fiction. The 1st novel got better as it went along. This one takes you hostage from page 1. The plotting is better, we get to know her sometime lover, Blomkvist (& some other key figures from the 1st book), better & the story is much more straight forward despite having a myriad of storylines (if that makes any sense).<br /> But make no mistake about it this is Salander's show & I cannot get her out of my head. I don't want to & I'm a baseball/football loving dude living in Central California who likes his share of beer & hits the gym fairly regularly.<br /> This book expands her story a lot & she is no less interesting because of it. WOW!

B00005214X|5.0|George Harrison wrote lots of songs during the Beatles years that were never recorded by the band, as he often had to plead just to have them heard.<br /><br />The huge majority of those songs appeared on this large outpouring of material (3 vinyl LP's in 1970). This mammoth collection, along with John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\", Paul McCartney's \\"Band On The Run\\" and Ringo Starr's \\"Ringo\\" albums is arguably the greatest solo project by any of the Beatles.<br /><br />The personnel ? A who's who of rock at the time; Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton, Billy Preston, Gary Brooker, Klaus Voormann, Alan White, Dave Mason, and uncredited performances by the likes of John Lennon, Peter Frampton and a young Phil Collins was a phenominal lineup.<br /><br />Legendary producer Phil Spector was also on board for the basic tracks.<br /><br />Though not present for the sessions, Bob Dylan's presence was felt as a writer, having written \\"If Not For You\\" on his own and co-written \\"I'd Have You Anytime\\" with George.<br /><br />The selections were eclectic, which gave the album it's charm.<br /><br />The religious rock of \\"My Sweet Lord\\", \\"What Is Life\\", \\"Hear Me Lord\\", \\"Awaiting On You All\\", \\"Beware Of Darkness\\", \\"The Art Of Dying\\" and \\"Isn't It A Pity\\";<br /><br />The humor of \\"Wah Wah\\", \\"Apple Scruffs\\", \\"Let It Roll\\" and \\"I Dig Love\\";<br /><br />The raw, human emotion of \\"Run Of The Mill\\", \\"Behind That Locked Door\\" ( a song about Bob Dylan), \\"Let It Down\\" and the title cut \\"All Things Must Pass\\";<br /><br />All these styles and approaches from folk ballads to steel guitar filled country to high powered rock give the listener variety.<br /><br />A collection of in-studio jamming was also included.<br /><br />This re-release includes several bonus tracks including several early versions of album tracks, a previously unissued recording titled \\"I Live For You\\", and a 30th anniversary re-recording of the mega hit \\"My Sweet Lord\\" further enhances this rock classic.<br /><br />If you love George's music, this is one you can't live without.  5 stars.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I find that buds never stay in my ears during workouts.  These are great and stay in!  I picked mine up at Target for 9.99 new.  Better than the standard ipod phones.  A good buy at $9.99. Works for me.
B002EWD08Q|4.0|I don't know any Acrtic Monkey fans at my school except a few Seniors at my school, but I have heard that this album was a disappointing among some of the fans and people who enjoyed their first two works.    I think that this is a milestone for the Acrtic Monkeys, it's good to do something out of the box, even though people may not like it.  One of the biggest problems about music is the fact that band are often place under pressure to produce bubble-gum music for the sells, but this band isn't playing for the glory.  They play because they enjoy it.      The album's tempo may be slower than the others, therefore less amiable for people who listen for the single, but it will grow on you after a few listens.  I'm not going to compare this album to their previous works because it's too different...  Sometimes you just need to stop the comparisions and thank the new material.    I personally enjoyed this album, and I think I will purchase the album soon.
B000PKX2KA|4.0|I purchased this to make a GPS equipment for my Nikon D90. When I checked CD-Rom included, there was no driver for Windows7. I installed Vista driver and it worked. The included program also worked. However I have to run it as administrator.

B002ZG97RE|2.0|Bring your motion sickness pills. You've got the same dumb-ass jittery, gyrating camera techniques used in the Borne movies, numbers 2 & 3. Dumb! Dumb! Dumb!    It's also a very overdone action film. Boring, and predictable.
0743454537|4.0|My Sister's Keeper is a heartbreaking story about a girl's struggle to make her parents understand that she no longer wants to be a donor for her terminally ill sister, Kate. Anna Fitzgerald is a beautiful 12 year old girl with her whole life ahead of her. She is intelligent, witty, athletic and beautiful. But she has a secret: she was conceived to save her older sister's life. From a very young age, Anna has been poked and prodded with needles. She has given her sister blood, bone marrow, and any other body fluids needed to keep her sister, who suffers from leukemia, alive for just a little longer.<br /><br />Kate has surprisingly beat the odds in her battle with leukemia. She is a beautiful teenager who wants a chance at life, but doesn't want it at her sister's expense. She doesn't ask her sister for anything but is thankful that Anna is her perfect match, which has helped her live up until now. When Kate's kidneys begin to fail, her parents ask Anna to make the sacrifice and donate. But this is where Anna draws the line.<br /><br />Jodi Piccoult writes a moving story about a family that is ripped at the seams from years of living with a terminally ill child. Life revolves around Kate's needs and Anna is the unwitting savior. Brother Jesse has long ago gotten lost in the wake of the Fitzgerald's race to save Kate and has turned to a life of drugs, crime and pyromania to force his parents to pay attention to him for once.<br /><br />Ms. Piccoult's writing is very intelligent and well researched. The supporting characters are very likeable and succeed in fleshing out a well told story. The subject matter is tragic and even though Anna's parents are often depicted as having tunnel vision when it comes to Kate, you cannot cast them as villains when the choices they make are ones no parent should ever have to. Their pain is evident and Piccoult makes you see that there is no black and white in this case.<br /><br />The plot twists at the end were completely unexpected, tragic and bittersweet, but necessary. I commend the author for having the courage to end the book as she did and her plot twists earn high marks from me. Definite good read.t necessary.

1439102813|5.0|Clearly the topic is not easy for everyone to read - but the book is so well written - written from \\"alice's' point of view the book takes the reader through the life of a healthy, maginficent mind to a mind that breaks down and fails this woman at such a young age...It is heartbreaking and sad but truly and amazing book!  I don't think I could of read this book if I was older the 40 as the topic is just too real and hits too close to home...but at the ripe age 36 I was able to read it and not think that it might someday soon be me.
B00005B1W7|5.0|\\"QB VII\\" is a great read and almost as good a view!  Despite some slow moments, it is a captivating movie crossing the lives of two men.  Each has seemingly redeemed himself for sins of the past.  One does it successfully, yet is ultimately punished.  The other is unsuccessful and continues to  live with his demons until he has falsely convinced himself that his sins are in the past and forgotten.  But his sins are beyond redemption in this world as he discovers while his life dissolves in pain.  Performances by Ben Gazzara and Anthony Hopkins are brilliant.  The rest of the cast is simply great.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|nintendo still makes these for a reason, and that reason is that in addition to being one of the best controllers ever designed it's also the only usable controller for most 3D games.<br />the classic controller is well suited to 2D and the wiimote works well for motion enabled games, but the gamecube pad is the only one that makes sense for the N64 and modern games with conventional controls... so if you want to play a variety of games comfortably, you unfortunately have to buy all three.<br /><br />luckily this controller is well worth the cost. the build quality is just as high (if not slightly better) than the originals; the difference is that the cord is thicker and several feet longer so that you can play without pulling the console over, and both the cord and controller are colored to match the wii. the white finish looks really attractive in person; the original controllers with black cables will look ugly in comparison.<br /><br />but let it be known that this controller does not work well for everything; SNES titles and earlier can be awkward or unplayable using the gamecube button layout. again, your best bet for those is the classic controller pro. this controller is  suited to N64 games, gamecube games (obviously), and wii games like mariokart that don't lose anything by ditching motion controls, so be aware of what's in your library before you decide.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|The only problem with this collection is that its viewers grow to love and admire characters who are doomed to hellfire, if such punishment exists for those who cause suffering to others.  And these gangsters create abominable suffering on a large scale.  Too often we are shown the personal lives and feelings and families of the men who commit atrocities, and we recognize qualities which are sympathetic, even sadmirable.  Make no mistake, however.  The aforementioned being the case this collection contains, perhaps, the greates movie ever made(I), another movie of incredible magnitude(II), and a third which is very good.  Already a classic, the collection will be viewed like people read Shakespeare - seemingly forever.
0316044938|4.0|First off, I'm going to admit that it's been years since I've read this novel so I can't comment on specifics of the story. But what I do know is that it has stayed with me. The plot idea is as original as they come. The rape and murder of Susie Salmon was a gruesome and devastating tragedy and it changed the lives of her family and friends forever. The reactions and evolution of each and every person affected is portrayed rather well throughout the novel as Susie watches from above. I felt for all of the characters at one time or another (with the exception of the sick and twisted murderer) and I truly felt it was believable. For a long time, I let my opinion of the book be marred by the ending, where Susie gets the opportunity to enter the body of a friend to have a sexual encounter with the boy she liked when she was murdered. Yes, the whole scene seemed contrived and even though I still think it could have been left out of the book and made it that much better, I think I understand it better now. Some people thought it was stupid that she would want her one last human experience to be a sexual one considering the fact that she had been raped before she was murdered. I thought that as well at first. Now I think that it was a way for her to experience that sexual acts are not always violent - and in the process, she was able to gain closure on the wistfulness that she has throughout the entire novel about missing out on growing up. At the time I read this novel, it was unique and different from anything I'd ever before read. And as I said earlier, it has stayed with me for years. If a book can have that affect on me, then it's definitely worth a recommendation!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I originally saw it in the theater and it was awesome.  Its not quite that wonderful on the much smaller TV screen, but is still a movie I will watch again and again.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I was elated to find that George and Giles Martin had released this work.    The sound quality is excellent and I play it all the time.    Would recommend it to any Beatles fan.
B003CR9BYE|1.0|Several reviewers have stated that edits made to correct flaws in the original vocal and instrumental performances were ignored in the preparation of this disc.  As soon as I put the disc in my car CD player I, too, knew that something was amiss.  But I got that feeling almost immediately on the very first track (\\"The Girl From Ipanema\\") long before the \\"clam\\" on the word \\"day\\" that everyone is talking about.  I immediately realized that the entire vocal for this classic song was an alternate to the one used on the original LP (and the first CD versions).  Listen to the phrasing of the very first verse and you'll see what I mean.  On the original, Sinatra uses short pauses to emphasize \\"tan\\", \\"young\\" and \\"lovely\\" and a brief pause between \\"the girl from Ipanema goes walking and\\" and \\"when she passes each one she passes...\\"  This way of phrasing gave the song its laidback, understated, relaxing bossa-nova feel.  The vocal we get on this release is Frank rushing through the entire first verse (one VERY long sentence) as if he's in a race with himself and daring himself not to take a breath.  Ironically, the legato phrasing for which Sinatra is justifiably famous and admired is not the best way to put this song over and I will guarantee that Frank knew it, made adjustments and got it right on the next take.  Why this alternate vocal was used is anyone's guess but I've got a feeling that alternate vocals, or portions thereof, were used on other songs on this disc as well.  Many of them just don't sound like the original LP.    There are also several crackling sounds present in the early moments of \\"Dindi\\" that mar that classic performance as well.  These cases, plus the ones cited by other reviewers, render this disc virtually unlistenable to those of us who regard these performances among the most memorable and pleasurable in Sinatra's vast catalogue.  Truly a crying shame.
B002ZIAC26|4.0|Baltimore's Dream-pop duo Beach House seem to have put together yet another beautiful album with Teen Dream. But Dream possesses a quiet intimacy unlike previous Beach House records. While the entire album captivates with Beach House's signature atmospheric sound, \\"10 Mile Stereo\\" is where Teen Dream peaks, with a bittersweet synth-line that is vaguely reminiscent of OMD's \\"So In Love.\\" Though possessing a chorus splashed with sparkling hope, the song's highlight lies in Legrand's soaring \\"forever\\" lyric--that glides over a growing percussion, resonating long after the song has ended. An epic surge of atmosphere, prefaced only by beaten drum, 10 mile stereo is the crescendo of Teen Dream's slow tide. Other highlights include the often praised \\"Zebra\\" and \\"Take Care.\\"
0439023483|5.0|great book.  reminded me a lot of \\"House of the Scorpion\\", but this was actually much better.  had to buy the sequel for full retail price in a bookstore because i couldn't wait to see where the story went.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|My husband and I originally saw this video on television and loved it so much we ordered a copy for our daughter and family in Oregon. We all are natives of Quincy and the south shore, so it held special meaning for us as we can visit the historic houses. The production is first class throughout; all the actors and actresses were cast very well and the reality of life in that time was portrayed without 'Hollywood' depiction. Abigail was some special woman; I just finished a book on her alone. Without her, John would have not been 1/2 the man he was. Neither would women in America be where they are today!  Buy this film and enjoy rerun after rerun!  Beverly Moore, Quincy, Massachusetts
B00005JPKE|5.0|\\"If we could read the secret history of our enemies, we should find in each man's life sorrow and suffering enough to disarm any hostility.\\" (Longfellow)    Eastwood's masterpiece certainly humanizes the WW II Japanese military in a way that few movies ever have. I would however suggest watching Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence (Oshima) for an insight into their appalling treatment of Allied prisoners of war, which cannot be ignored.    An immensely talented Japanese cast, headed by the superb Watanabe and Ninomiya, bring these characters to life in a way that renders this an unforgettable movie.    In a career filled with excellence, this to me is Eastwood's finest hour.    Outstanding.
B0000041TD|5.0|I have been listening to this recording since my parents played it in the living room when I was in the single digits. At this point it is so profoundly hard-wired into my brain that it is difficult to be objective about it; but every so often I hear another recording of La Boheme and realise why I love it so much. The cast is superb and it has the raw, youthfulness that La Boheme normally lacks. Most of all, this is Pavarotti at his very, very best, and in my view no tenor can even come close.
0425166805|5.0|The book is great, I can't put it down.   I ordered a used book in \\"good\\" condition, and was amazed - the book they sent looks brand new. The shipping was fast, the price was great. Forget the mall, I'm hooked on buying through Amazon.
B0019LY5IM|1.0|DVD's all had a weird glue residue on them that at first looked like scratched.  Royal pain washing them off.  After a few attempts, I still had stuttering going on during playback.  Cheap packaging and merchandising of good content.  But really, DVD quality, isn't that what separates it from watching the show on tv?
B002TYZKIM|5.0|The rehearsals for Michael Jackson's last tour were filmed and provide a stunning look at a superstar entertainer and consummate professional at work.  We see him sing and dance many songs along with the special effects that contributed so much to the dynamic show.  The film itself is more home movie than documentary; comments from the show staff come later in the extras.<br /><br />I hadn't followed Jackson's life for years and assumed he was past his prime, but this film completely changed my opinion.  I was mesmerized by his energy and stamina, his gracefulness and power, and his absolute knowledge of what was right for the show.  He looked to be in the best shape of his life and happy to be mounting his last tour.  Fans of Michael Jackson will certainly enjoy this last monument to his considerable talent.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I first heard this band on 91.9 WFPK Little Lion Man. After finding out who the band was i immediatly purchased the album, and it is amazing. Whoever hears it becomes instantly addicted. I just hope they come to the palace in Louisville, Ky in the future. There ability to increase the sound and tempo within thier songs is down right bad ass. My dad feels the lyrics are more spiritually based, where I feel they are more relationship based. Everyone gets a differant impression. I listen to this album practically everyday. I like to say they are The Avette Brothers on crack. You've never heard folk like this before.(Its all country to me)After The Storm is my favorite track. If you buy this album and like the sound give I, and Love, and You by the Avette Brothers a listen.

B000UJ48SQ|5.0|Barry Lyndon, released in 1975, a 3 hour costume drama based on an obscure Thackeray novel about an Irish rogue, comes as close to perfection as any Stanley Kubrick film. Beautifully filmed and with a score featuring Schubert's piano trio in E flat and Vivaldi's cello concerto in E minor, the film is slowly paced to reflect the pace of life of the era depicted.<br />Until the blu-ray version of Barry Lyndon is released, we will have to be satisfied with the 2007 DVD.
0679805273|5.0|Everything was perfect with my order.  I order several copies of this book every year to give to high school graduates as an inspirational little gift.
1591843065|5.0|I've got this book as a gift from a student. After a long wait, I decided to read it during a trip across the country. The main messages are simple, objective and well presented. After reading the book you will learn nice hints on how to better organize and communicate complex ideas using a pictorial approach. I confess that this book impacted the way I prepare my presentations.
B00005QGAX|5.0|The name Michael Jackson speaks for its-self and BAD is just one of many CD's that sold millions of copies.

081297381X|5.0|I actually read the 1st edition many times with notes taken. The 2nd edition adds some new materials. We should read this book with critical thinking.    I also suggest people to read Malcolm Gladwell's What the Dog Saw. One of the chapters is about this author. We all know the real world and the common theory of how it works. Black Swan complements the common theory. For every trade there are two sides: long or short. One of them has to be wrong. Most people bet against Nassim Taleb on out of money options and win most of the time in small premium but lose huge during Black Swan events. However, blowing up is not the result of either trades. It is the bad money management. If we keep enough cash, size the trade properly, we can win either way.    The most value of this book, however, is that we can not predict the outcome for sure either on fundamental basis or technical basis. It keeps us honest.
0517548232|5.0|Hazlitt delivers to the reader the most incredibly profound, and simultaneously most incredibly simple economical lesson yet penned by man.  Moreover, he does so in a manner which provides both relevant and easily understandable examples to the lay, while still providing the depth and principle sufficient to intrigue and inform even the most well versed economically among us.      Whether your life's experience in economics amounts to balancing your checkbook, or graduate level studies, if you haven't yet read Hazlitt's short text, you owe it to yourself.    And once you have read it, I implore you to share it.  If ever you should come across anyone in your path with the slightest interest in economics, even be they in slight argument towards the collective, lend them your copy and follow up with discussion after they return it.  The more people in this world who read and understand the lesson taught by this text, the better our chance at progressing to true freedom.
B0039208CG|5.0|A lot of Bat-fans give this movie flack for being a throw-back to the campy Adam West TV show, but a movie shouldn't be judged for what it isn't, but how well it achieves what it is trying to do.  And this one delivers.    First thing noticed is the fast-paced directing, with quick, action-oriented editing that reminds one of the early Bond films.  The action is relentless, and the movie is never boring.  It reminds me of Guy Hamilton's short-cut plot developments in \\"Force 10 from Navarone\\".    At the same time, the viewer will notice that Gotham is no longer mono-chromatic, but a bright, vibrant city with expansive, monolithic architecture that disturbingly dwarfs the inhabitants, much like Stalin's Russian architecture in the '50s. Yet, the lights tend to highlight the shadows.  The dizzying, elevated roadways and balconies are spectacular and a little frightening at the same time, like the landscape of a claustrophobic dream.    One instantly notes that Danny Elfman's great score is no longer used.  However, the new soundtrack does just as well for this fresh take on Batman, with surrealistic, disonant notes and a Wagnerian grandeur.  Supporting the great sets and costumes, it makes for a terrific, \\"Wizard of Oz\\" type experience.    And objectively speaking, the character development, depth and interaction are far better than in the previous 2 outings.  There's quite a bit going on here and the cast does a great job of making it all seem believable in spite of the outlandish goings ons.    If you gotta pay homage to the goofier '50s and '60s comics, this is the way to do it.  Obviously, some would rather that such developments were kept out of the movies, but it is hard to ignore how the Batman comics had been for a quarter of a century.  And I really can't think of a gritty, \\"realistic\\" way to introduce a silly character like Robin.    That being said, one problem with this movie is the inclusion of 2-Face.  In the '60s, this character never made an appearancein comics or TV as it was felt that he was too grim for the campy, child-friendly dreck that the Dark Knight had become by then.  Yet, this movie used him as just another zany villain like the Riddler, and any true fan would find this treatment of this most tragic of Batman villains unforgiveable.  I almost docked this movie one star for this, but I've left it to counter some of the unfair bashing it gets by fanboys simply for reminding them of a period in Batman's history that most would rather forget.  And Carrey's Riddler was disturbingly, aggressively bizarre.  In fact, his performance was almost as good as Frank Gorshin's from the TV show, the only villain from the old series to actually project a sense of sneering, sardonic menace.    My fav Batman movie is \\"Dark Knight\\"(great representation of the best modern comics), 2nd is \\"Batman\\" with Keaton(atmospheric take on original, film noir '30s comics), and this one reviewed is my 3rd favorite(for successfully balancing the darker aspects of the modern comics while paying homage to the camp years).  You see, I don't demand that they make the same movie over and over again.  I'm capable of opening my mind and enjoying the different versions for the various kinds of experiences they offer.  Those that don't do the same are missing out on a treat.
B000BSLU2S|4.0|I don't know what I am doing so take this review with a grain of salt. This is the first time that I have built a PC on my own. I do not know enough to give a technical review. But from a noobie standpoint, I can say with absolute authority that it came out of the tube with ease.<br /><br />I went to the manufacturers website to get detailed instructions as this did not come with any. I have one of the best rated after market air coolers out there now and even so, I am running a bit warm. More than likely, this is due to lack of experience. I followed the instructions to the letter but I'm thinking I may have done something wrong. I did write the manufacturer for advice and received a quick response so that's a point for them.<br /><br />I'll update this when I know more. But for now, I am going with four stars because I just don't yet know if it's me or the product but my bet is on me being the cause. I'll let you know. As if you cared.
B0039SFKSW|2.0|Oh sorry, guys!! But once again (after \\"Phoenix\\")- also regarding of their worst album-cover ever (Roger Dean, where have you been recently?), They perform some normal and quite poppy songs here (whose length is about 5 minutes and each one having got the same mood tune by tune, as long as it's not concluded...), which is not so good after all!! I understand their business strategy, I know it's necessary for them to survive in the modern music market of nowadays, but the other songs (perhaps with the exception of \\"Holy War\\"), are useful within a John Wetton solo album (with all my respect for an album like \\"Arkangel\\" or \\"Battle lines\\", just to mention a couple among the other solo works), but it doesn't reflect the job of a superband...each member with his own important talent should be worth in producing something different (do you remember their remarkable return on stage? Well probably it's the unique album regarding their new era- entitled \\"Fantasia\\"- which is well worth checking out...) .  C. Palmer and Steve Howe instead would have been more involved in the instrumental passages, if the songs were more technical and a little bit \\"symphonic\\"; but of course, talking about the present work (even though \\"Omega\\" should be the antipode of \\"Alpha\\" and- unlike this latter anyway inferior than their debut album- it's often easy), it doesn't implicate automatically that it can't contain a few features of prog music inside!! Nevertheless I recognize their new attempt: that is They try to avoid some stupid compromises, like within a few commercial hit ballads in general, and moreover (even though G. Downes is fond of the analogical and old synthesizers, producing an old and \\"dated\\" sound) this latter keyboard- player is always able to play according to his own melodic liking...which is perfectly \\"coupled\\" with the mood of the leader J. Wetton, who unfortunately has almost ignored the skill regarding the other two veterans (once upon a time one of the best drummers withinthe prog scene along with one of the most talented guitarists, sharing the same scene for many years). If you are completely into the prog world you'll give this \\"Omega\\" one star in the evalution; otherwise, judged as a poppy album, the present work is quite good...I'm happy to see them live on stage anyway, but please don't let me judge their studio albums anymore!!
B003HKN51Q|5.0|Saw it last nite at the theatre!! it was amazing!!! seeing the place packed, all ages! Clapping cheering standing ovation, for a movie screen!! NO OTHER ARTIST!! can even come close to his crown!! ALWAYS THE KING!!! He was and STILL is the GREATEST!!!    All above fantastic!!!  there is alot more to on tour that they never released that i have, and still more i dont have, that they should release, but also dont forget the ALOHA concert, that show will be remembered forever the most watched TV program of all time!!    Long Live the KING!!!!    perry
B002ZRPQ5K|2.0|I was definitely excited to see a new KEANE release, and really taken aback to see some of the negative reviews (here and elsewhere).  Upon listening, it became apparent why the negatives seem to outweigh the positives.  There are some fantastic songs here (\\"Back In Time\\", \\"Your Love\\" and \\"My Shadow\\" being the highlights), and \\"Stop For a Minute\\" sounded really promising as well...    Then came the rap...    Ladies and gentlemen, I give you music's biggest \\"what the (expletive deleted)???\\" moment for 2010.  I'll admit rap isn't my cup of tea, but this is beyond deplorable.  All I can say is it's a good thing I wasn't taking a drink when I first heard \\"Baby you are just beautiful, From crown to your cuticles\\", because it would have gone projectile.  I'm also not thrilled with \\"Ishin Denshin\\"; not so much because of guest vocalist Tigarah, but more for that cheesy \\"See how the world goes 'round\\" chorus which sounds like it came from a rejected Epcot Center musical number.  I'm also dumbfounded as to why Keane had to revisit \\"Gonna Fly Now\\" (from ROCKY) for \\"Looking Back\\".  Finally I was hoping for a full-length album (as opposed to a slightly extended EP), and given the caliber of many of Keane's past b-sides (most of which would have made an awesome full-length CD in its own right) it only adds to the overall disappointment.  Three stellar tracks save this from being a one-star CD.
B0036EBARO|5.0|\\"Head First\\" is Goldfrapp's finest album since \\"Supernature,\\" bar none.  Her homage to 80s flashback pop is brilliant, and she pulls it off well.  \\"Head First\\" is my favorite song on the album...there's such an uplifting mellowness to it that soothes my content soul.  Can't wait to see her at the Hammerstein Ballroom on June 23rd!  For any true fan of Goldfrapp, pick this album up.  It's a must-have.
B0037AGASG|5.0|I am 51 and purchased this CD for myself. It has a good beat and this young man reminds me of a cross between Donny Osmond and Michael Jackson. That is who we listened to in the 70's. Justin Bieber is a talented and fresh artist   with much potential to last for years to come. Young and old will enjoy this \\"hip hop pop\\" music and I enjoy listening to it when I drive. It is upbeat and gives my old bones some energy and joy. I rated it five stars and would purchase more music from Justin in the future and would give them to my nieces as gifts!
030726999X|5.0|The late Stieg Larsson's \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" brings his wonderful \\"Millenium\\" series of crime/mystery novels to a probable close.  I suppose it's possible that some of his sketches for additional books in this series could see the light of day at some point, but this fine novel is being publicized as the final novel in the trilogy.  Either way, it's a terrific novel and wonderful read to what's one of the best series of its genre.<br /><br />\\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" picks up where \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" (also a 5-star book) ended.  Those who've read that novel remember the explosive conclusion and will certainly be keen to see where things head.  I believe this particular novel will likely be more enjoyable to readers who've read the other two in the series, but that's not a prerequisite.  Larsson provides enough detail and summary (spread throughout the novel) to make this novel fine as a standalone.<br /><br />The plot once again revolves around punk, street-tough, computer-hacker Lisbeth Salander and middle-aged journalist Mikael Blomkvist.  Salander is in the hospital recovering from wounds and is once again (or still) accused of heinous crimes.  Blomkvist is out to prove her innocence and uncover corruption within the Swedish government/secret police.  Nearly all the characters from the previous books make an appearance as do several new ones (to include a new love interest for Blomkvist).  The book starts a little slow and Larsson provides perhaps too many details of Swedish government history, but things really pick up and the last 150 pages take the reader for an incredible ride.  This is one of those rare books I skipped sleep to finish.  One mild complaint--the translation (or perhaps the original) overdoes the use of the word \\"that\\".  It's a mild annoyance once you notice it--and it's hard not to--but even that fails to detract from the story or the pace of the book.  This is the best novel in the trilogy and it's a great trilogy.  If you've not read any of these books, start from the beginning and enjoy the ride.  If you've already read the others, what are you waiting for?  A worthy read for certain--I only regret there aren't more to come.logy.

B003BKF696|3.0|yeah, it has been discussed...to no end but how do they record Terrible Love like a bunch of BS where the rest of the album sounds quite good? I'm no stranger to low-fi but it doesn't fit here and they start off this album with a demo quality track? Not acceptable.     Beyond that, I can't review this album yet. Too early.. WAY to early. Yeah, it is dreary but so was In Rainbows but that got better and better.. this might as well. The 'eat your brains' line is laughable though. An otherwise great song ruined by a stupid line..you can just see the rest of the band rolling their eyes.. breakup pending!
6305972591|2.0|The acting was terrible! There were so many holes in the plot. The character development in the short story was completely missing from the movie. I didn't care about the characters in the movie. There was zero suspense or scares like in the short story. This is just another example of Hollywood changing a story when it was good as it was.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I just recently after so many years got down to watching these movies and to tell you the truth i enjoyed them all very throughly. I don't own part 2 or 3 yet but i will once amazon ships me the blu-ray restoration set. Anyways here l would like to evaluate all 3 films and disscuss my true feelings as to why i enhoy this beautiful fautless and stunning trilogy.   First i'll explain the 1st godfather as follows. In this criticaly aclaimed masterpiece  Francis ford coppola really focuses on central themes of human life such as family moral decline struggle to survive nad the changing of times. The film starts off with an elaborate wedding ceremony for the don's only daughter connie . At this wedding we quickly get a well detailed look at how this family operates . We also met several of our primary characters the reluctant son michael played brilliantly by Al pacino in all 3 films Sonny the hot tempered son played by James cann and Kay michael's girlfriend who he promised to he would never become his \\"Family\\".   The film later shows a attmpt to kill the don after he refuses an offer to join the narcotics bussiness and this leads michael to step in and avenge his father which later starts his transformation into the new don.  The way coppola weaves between the multiple story arcs here is great every scene , line, performance and sub-plot added to the film minor or major. The cinematography is gorgeous and the vilonce has a smart, simple yet brutally effective ring to it. The middle holds up quite well and the pacing is held together very well something the other two are good at as well. The acting is phenomal and the feeling here is really humantisic  and real and it shows throghout . the dialouge is brilliant with lines you won't forget.  The characters are very well-written and the ending is very memorable and intense.  overall the elements , subject matter ,writing and feel of the film are very well done and beautifully written and make this film a must-see smart, humanistic , real gritty , engaging and original grade A+    next i'll explain gf 2 like this. in the very dark intense and intricate companion piece of the original GF 2 tells two very disticnt powerful expansive ambitous riveting and complex stories. One is of Michael Corleone 's fatal rise to power nad how he single-handedly destroys his life of prosper with his cold ruthless manner and   young vito rising up to the top . The Flahbacks here are great Robert de Niro is perfect as the young vito and really gets into character and the flashbacks were well-written and did an outstanding job flushing out vito's history escepially the later ones . Michael's story is very good too although it does lack some of part 1's power it still is a very complex layered superb mafia tale with deep layers of phsycology and is intense and original and not some of the recycled mumbo-jumbo some sequels end up as ( ie pirates of the caribbean 3)  . Michael 's plotline involves him dealing with a betrayl within the family while trying to do bussuness with a jewish gangster Hyman Roth . This storie takes michal from Havanna to New york to Miami . The best scenes are in Havanna and during the communion celebration opening which like part 1 did a brilliant job of establishing thing early on and did a great job of showing how different things have gotten for the family since Michael's new reign. Another noteworthy scene is when Michael confronts the traitor in the family or when Michael goes to Hyman Roth and asks who tried to have his associate Frank pentangli killed who is played brillianttly by Michael V. Gozzo.   Diane keaton is great as kay and shares some really great moments with michael and the scene with them disscussing her leaving is amazing.  The vilonce like in paer 1 is brutal , effective and chilling and works well into the plot. The themes in here of Moral disintergration , corruption , greed , treachery , loss and isoaltion are excellently handled never do we question ford coppola's reason for doing this or that  it all fits and the film fits naturally nothing seems akward or mishapen or cookie-cutter or stale it always keeps itself moving. The cast in ths picture is brilliant From another amazing performance by Al pacino Great work by Diane keaton John cazale , Robby Duvall , lee strassburg Mike v gozzo and of course Robby de niro and even Tallia shire does sone good work too.  The other actors are good too but the ones i metioned above i think are the best performers in the whole film. This is easily one of the best sequels of all time , smart m gripping , complex , original, brutal, intense, Dark and emotional and extermely vibrant and colorful the realism and humanity are great as well and the film paints a very good picure of a man's  dark plunge toward decay and another's toward prosper and wealth. overall a great follow-up companion piece to it's predecessor and very much a must-see and brillantly acted . Grade A+   next i'll explain Gf 3 like this.  In the final installment of one of cinema;s finest most interesting trilogies  the film flashes foward many years  to show Michael corleone  as an aging old man trying to burie his past sins and leave the dirty world of crime and murder he immersed himself in part 1 and 2.   The storie thickens when Michael meets Vincet Mancini Sonny's llegetimate son from part 1 .   Vincet is determined to put rival gnagster joey zasa out of his misery.  After a heated confrontation with joey Michael decides to keep vincet under his wing .  The plot for part 3 is very emotional  and well-balanced nad very intelligent and engaging  and does a great job of using the backstory of the first two parts to tell the story . The acting while maybe dosen't outbeat that of part 1 and 2 is pretty good. Andy Garcia is great as Vincet mancini and Al pacino once again proves why he is MICHAEL CORLEONE this is the only guy who could really play michael the right way parts 1 2 and 3 wouldn't have been as good as they are todaywithout him. Diane keaton is strong and steady in her role and Eli wallach is good as Don altobello michael's latest adversary and Talia shire is wonderful in giving connie more edge nad pressence thiss time around.  The cinematography is brilliant-looking  and the music is great like in pars 1 and 2 and the vionce still is very effective and important to the film. The dialouge and writing are great overall and the ending is a powerhouse of emotion and very wellfilmed although the final shot could have been done better.  For the most part part 2 is a memorable , engagin. smart and very emotional and humanistic and operatic and very fluent and graceful and the way it unfurls very intelligently and for the most parti s very well-done i mean not everything in part 3  beats out part 1 and 2 but still it is effective and entertaining and sofia coppola is not as bad as everyone says although she's no brando or pacino. GRADE A+    In conclusion this is a very memorable well-written trilogy and is a brilliant addition to cinema as a whole definitely worth looking at it can't wait to take a look at it again.

B00190OHD6|5.0|SPOILER WARNING:  Do not read this review if you don't want to be spoiled!<br /><br />I just got finished watching this movie that I just rented here on Amazon.  Gerard Butler is one of my favorite actors of all time. Actually because of The Phantom of the Opera, he is my favorite actor of all time.  This was one of very few of his that I never seen before so I had to see it.<br /><br />This film is a very, very sad film and it made me cry actually.  The very beginning of the film, you see that Gerard Butler has died and I couldn't believe how quick it was into the film.  Not even ten minutes and he's gone.  I really loved how it showed her grief for him and you could tell how much she really loved him.  He obviously really loved her too to go through the act of having her mother send her all the letters from him which you don't learn it's from her until the end of the film.  I loved all the flashbacks and I really started to cry from that moment when she returns from Ireland and go to her mother and cries and they go to the park and she gets the last letter and has Connick Jr.  read aloud the last letter.  What's written in the last letter is so sad and emotional.<br /><br />To be honest, I never knew before I saw this film that Gerard dies in the beginning.  I never knew the plot and obviously never read the book.  So I was really expecting a romantic comedy and thought they would be together in the end.  But I was wrong and even though it's not what I expected, the fact that this film was able to move me, make me cry and I could relate to how she was in the grieving sense, I highly recommend at least a rental.  It's very emotional and sad.  I really enjoyed it.  And Ireland's scenery is gorgeous!
B002ZG977Y|1.0|It looked promising so I went to my local cineplex to see it on the large screen and waded through the 30 minutes of ads and previews. I had hopes of adding it to my sword and sandal fantasy collection. I couldn't take it. It started with Liam Neesom's costume. Nothing original about the vision of Mt. Olympus. I lasted through the giant crab scene which I felt was a ripped from the film \\"Mysterious Island\\". I was waiting for Captain Nemo to emerge from the sea. I could not stomach the acting and particularly Sam Worthington's portrayal Perseus. I kept waiting for him to say \\"Hey dude.\\" Instead there was this cynical little cameo from the original film where Perseus picks up a mechanical owl and asks \\"What is this?\\" Cute. No magic. Just roaring special effects.If you must have it, get it on discount. Maybe your kids will be impressed.

0201485672|5.0|I bought this book in 2004 and have read most of it multiple times.  This is not a how to write code book, it's a how to write and rewrite code well book.     Frankly, the reason I bought this book was because Kent Beck was a co-author.  His book \\"Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns\\" is a classic, even though it is tough to read.  Beck knows software development from practical experience, not only theoretical concepts.    I've been programming for 35 years, and this book reaffirmed what I had learned from working on many projects, writing many tens of thousands lines of code, and maintaining millions of lines of code.  Write tiny methods.  Each method should do one thing and do it well.  Avoid duplicate code for many reasons.    I practice the principles in this book everyday.  If you understand and practice them too, you will be a better software developer.

0321647440|5.0|I have been a fan of Apple's Training Series from Peachpit for some time. This book is no exception, and is extremely well written and easily understood and followed.<br /><br />I was more than happy to see that Peachpit and Apple collaborated quickly to get the first comprehensive instruction manual to print and it is a winner. The learning curve for Aperture is somewhat high, but the book guides you through the learning process gradually, with each chapter logically building on the last, and reducing the time needed to learn critical functions. The writing style is clear and end-user friendly, without a lot of techno-jargon complicating the process. By the end of the book, you'll have a very functional understanding of Aperture 3, and your processing time and workflow steps will be dramatically decreased.<br /><br />The book has a companion DVD with the media files necessary to follow the course as designed. It is NOT included with the e-book (Kindle) version, but can be downloaded from Peachpit Press. This is NOT reflected in the book, though customer service at Peachpit states it should have been. The book is only marginally useful without the companion media files which are clearly designed to be used in conjunction with the chapters in the book.<br /><br />The URL for the media files is listed in the comments to this review. (Amazon won't allow full URL's in reviews)  Be forewarned... it is a 3.6GB DMG file (Macs only).<br /><br />The Kindle version on the Apple iPad is STUNNING in its clarity and definition! The illustrations and pictures are phenomenal, and totally unexpected...oh so clear! This has made using the iPad for following the book next to my MacbookPro and Mac Pro a dream. It also reduces my baggage weight when traveling so that I no longer have to carry heavy manuals in suitcases to have ready reference material on the road. (I work overseas every other six-weeks). Peachpit is dedicated to offering virtually all of their books in digital form, and that's the only way I'll buy them in the future. The iPad makes it a perfect solution! (The book can also be viewed on a Kindle, but in monochrome which significantly reduces the value of photo-related manuals of this type)<br /><br />Five stars for this book... and five more to Amazon for offering it at a discounted price in digital form!

B002DKGWSE|3.0|Wes Craven's classic shocker \\"The Last House On The Left\\" gets a bigger budget, a better cast, and a polished look in this 2009 remake of the same name.  Unfortunately all of these elements do not help the film's overall dull feel.<br /><br />Fresh-faced Sara Paxton (\\"Aquamarine,\\" \\"Sydney White\\") portrays Mari Collingwood, a swimming champion and all-around good girl with a slight bad streak (which gets her into trouble) who takes a vacation with her parents, Emma (Monica Potter, \\"Con Air\\" and \\"Boston Legal\\") and John (Tony Goldwyn, \\"Ghost\\" and \\"Tarzan\\").  Once they arrive at the family lake house , Mari convinces her parents to spend a little time alone while she goes into town to hang out with her friend, Paige (Martha McIsaac, \\"SuperBad\\").  Mari's parents begin to enjoy their evening together while Mari and Paige decide to follow a stranger named Justin (Spencer Treat Clark, \\"Gladiator\\") to smoke marijuana.<br /><br />Once the trio of new friends begin to have fun, Justin's father, Krug (Garrett Dillahunt, \\"Deadwood\\") shows up along with his girlfriend, Sadie (Riki Lindhome, \\"Pulse\\") and Francis (Aaron Paul, \\"Big Love\\" and \\"Breaking Bad\\"), Justin's uncle.  Krug is freshly escaped from prison thanks to Sadie and Francis, and the group have made the headlines in the local newspaper.  Mari lets Krug have her parents' vehicle hoping he'll let her and Paige go.  Not willing to take a chance on  the pair ratting them out, the criminals decide to kidnap them as they stay on the run from the police.<br /><br />**POTENTIAL SPOILERS**<br /><br />Mari then tries to trick Krug into driving them by her home and attempts to escape.  This only angers the group (excepting Justin, who never really seems to want to go along with his father's criminal ways) and they commence to torturing and beating the girls in the forest just across the lake from Mari's family lake house.  Despite begging for their lives, Paige is murdered and Mari is raped and left for dead in the lake.<br /><br />The criminals then find themselves trapped in a storm and unwittingly head for the Collingwood's house in order to seek refuge and to get a little first aid due to their altercation with the girls.  Soon enough, the parents are tipped off that they are harboring their daughter's murderers.  This information drives Emma and John from being a mild-mannered, well-to-do couple into a sinister pair of vengeful parents.<br /><br />The tide is then turned on the criminals and a series of somewhat brutal and bizarre beatings and killings begin.<br /><br />**END SPOILERS**<br /><br />The film's premise of making the criminals the victims (well deserved, in this case) shows you just how dangerous being the bad guy really can be.  Krug, Francis, and Sadie argue with each other, show fear and doubt when faced with exposure, and even fall victim to their own egos at times.  While this makes for an interesting study in human nature and how quickly it can deteriorate in both good and bad people, the film struggles to fully deliver its message.  While I found myself cheering for the parents and hoping for the girls to escape, I never saw the film as more than just another Hollywood remake trying to outdo the original.<br /><br />While the film is uncomfortable to watch, it isn't so uncomfortable that you'll want to look away or mute the audio.  There is a bit of gore, especially splattering blood, but there have been plenty of other films out there that surpass this film's goriness (including the original).  There's also no real sense of terror or suspense since everything is played out right before your eyes.<br /><br />I will say that Paxton, Goldwyn, and Dillahunt do excellent jobs with their characters.  I was especially pleased with Paxton's performance, having only seen her portray sugary sweet characters as in \\"Aquamarine\\" or stereotypical teen snobs in films like \\"Sleepover.\\"  Clark comes off a little too emotional at times and Potter looked as if she was uncomfortable in her role.  Lindhome's somewhat psychotic portrayal of Sadie was good, but she remains a minor player in the film for the most part.  While there's little humor in the film, Paul's tough-guy portrayal of Francis is a bit funny.<br /><br />Overall, this film is mildy entertaining but doesn't compare to the brutality and rawness of the original.  It just goes to show that a film's \\"slickness\\" doesn't always add up to a successful picture.  Recommended as a one-time rental.she remains a minor player in the film for the most part.

B002ZG9788|3.0|CLASH OF THE TITANS<br /><br />STARRING: Sam Worthington, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Gemma Arterton, Jason Flemyng, Alexa Davalos, , Mads Mikkelsen, Natalia Vodianova, Luke Evans, Izabella Miko, Danny Houston and Nicholas Hoult<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Travis Beacham, Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi; based on the screenplay by Beverly Cross<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Louis Leterrier<br /><br />Rated: PG - 13<br />Genre: Action / Fantasy<br />Release Date: 02 April 2010<br />Review Date: 17 April 2010<br /><br />There are so many, that I think I'll just bunch all of my questions up together at the beginning and get it over with. Why does Perseus have a shaved head when everyone else in the film has the appropriate hairstyle for the time period? Why did they CGI Medusa? Why does Calibos look like he belongs in Wrong Turn rather than this film? Why does Hades walk with a staggered limp and have such a dramatic dry voice and a burnt scalp? Why does Zeus need to wear armor while sitting upon his throne in Olympus? Why did everyone feel the need to engrave abs into their armor? Were they really that bored? I know they didn't have cable or Nintendo back then, but come on! And lastly, why was this film re-made at all? It's a Saturday morning classic B-rate 80's flick and that's the way we like it. It's not a CGI infested Hollywood Blockbuster, and attempting to make it so, was a disappointment.<br /><br />But who knows - perhaps Clash of the Titans would have made a good huge Hollywood film, had they done it right. If they had stepped away from the cheesiness of the original altogether, and started fresh - maybe we'd have something. Instead, what we are left with is a sorry attempt and what feels like a collaboration between the corny appeal of the classic, breaded with special effects and this goes together about as good as lasagna and cocoa puffs would.<br /><br />Having never seen the original, my friend leaned over, about 10 minutes in and whispered in my ear, \\"Why does this feel like we're watching a bad 70's flick?\\" If memory serves, this was right around the time where Zeus' metal armor was ridiculously gleaming and shining at us like something out of a bad rock video. I smiled to myself and informed her, that we essentially were - as the original was released in 1981, and this version was caked with its long since dried-over cheese.<br /><br />The original is one of my favorite films. It's fantastic. It's a cult classic and is so bad, that is in turn so good; if that makes any sense at all! It's extra jam-packed-filled with B-rate dialogue, B-rate sets and of course, glorious old school stop animated sequences and corny props. Somehow, the giant scorpions looked more convincing in the original.<br /><br />Both films have almost the exact same story; the only major difference being that the orders of events have been randomly shuffled around to appear in a different sequence. And this new version offers Hades as the lead villain, when Calibos was the one causing havoc for Perseus in the original. He still appears here, but looks nothing like he did previously and is only in the film for a small amount of time.<br /><br />While I wasn't a fan of the haircut, even though it fits Sam Worthington every bit as Vin Diesel's fits him; Worthington still delivers a great performance as Perseus. He's a gifted actor and is only getting better.<br /><br />It's also no shocker that Liam Neeson makes for a good Zeus. If I had to picture what God would look like in the form of a man, it would be Neeson all the way. There is something truly majestic about the guy.<br /><br />Had I not recently seen Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightening Thief, maybe I would not have been so disappointed with the Medusa sequence Clash offers us; but I highly doubt it. In Percy Jackson, Medusa was brilliantly played by Uma Thurman and the CGI snakes that were her hair were astronomically more impressive.<br /><br />In addition to this, there was far more depth given to Uma's version of the character, throughout a stimulating scene of dialogue exchanged between her and Percy. No such scene is found in the Clash of the Titans and the CGI is weak and tiresome.<br /><br />The entire flow of Percy Jackson, was better executed and although each scene served primarily to set up the following scene as our hero marched on with his purpose much like Perseus does here; it never felt that way. Clash of the Titans spoon-feeds us one sequence after another like we are a newborn strapped in a highchair. We're not children; we can handle a little more drama. Which of these two films was aimed at kids again?<br /><br />The one thing Clash of the Titans got almost perfect was its climax. Very awesome CGI during the Kraken's scene. Amazing stuff here. Great water-swooping camera shots, and a lot going on at once and the thing was just great to watch as it emerged from the water to reek havoc.<br /><br />The only problem with this scene is that it seems like they spent so much money on making the Kraken look sensational, that they had none left to close the film out with. We go from the Kraken to what should have been an even bigger showdown, to the credits.<br /><br />If you can watch both films and compare them, then great; but if you have to choose between this film and Percy Jackson... I trust you know what to do.dialogue exchanged between her and Percy. No such scene is found in the Clash of the Titans and the CGI is weak and tiresome.

B002ZRPQ5K|1.0|I was so excited to hear about this release, I listened to it in my car on the way to work this morning, my commute is 30 min and yes, I was doen with it well before I got to work!  mainly because of the 9 songs sold by amazon, the first was a lame intro and 4 YES FOUR contain rap.  While I do not hate rap and was ok when I heard it in the first track, to hear in in half the tracks was just awful.    \\"back in time\\", \\"clear skies\\" and \\"your love\\" and \\"my shadow\\" all stood out to me, but that's it....I read this was classified as an EP, I hope they release a full album without the hip hop stuff, I dont mind a song, but if I wanted to listen to that, I'd buy an album by a hop hop artist.
B001DHXT20|5.0|First off, I want to say that the rating of this film is rather deceptive as 3/4's of the 1-star raters are complaining not about the actual film but about their seller or the condition of their DVD. With that dealt with I'll get into my review...  Plot: The plot I actually found quite interesting and different from what I had anticipated (in a good way). I shall not summarize it as that ruins the fun and has already done. I will say also that I liked that Bruce wasn't sitting around in an office being silly because, honestly? All the other 'Bruce Banner's elevators haven't gone all the way up.   Characters: I found the characters quite realistic, and liked that Bruce was more action-y than he's ever been depicted. Instead of sitting around in a lab waiting for everyone to do for him he actually takes care of himself and uses his head. So as oppose to being the central character who completely relies on everyone else to do all the work and him become Hulk, we actually saw more of Bruce than Hulk, a fact that I think allowed for more character development. I really do wish that we had been able to explore the General (and Betty's father's) character more, but due to the length of the film (112 min.) I suppose I can only wish for so much.  Acting: Now acting, I think that both Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, and all the supporting actors did a good job in their roles. They didn't overpower each other so you were like \\"righht, BRUCE is the main character\\" or anything. Everyone was what they were supposed to be. Edward as lead character, Liv an only slightly secondary one, and so on.  Execution: There is one point that I do have to say wasn't exactly to my liking, and that was the animation of the Hulk. He seemed a bit top-heavy and had large feet in hands like an adolescent-teenage boy. They were not proportionate to the rest of his body. And as usual his character development left a lot to be desired. I'm still confused as to whether Bruce and Hulk are separate entities inone body or simply mirrors of one man, like Jekyll and Hyde. In addition, if Hulk is merely the carnal, angry, uncontrollable side of Bruce he got rather jilted in the way of Bruce's brains.  Comparisons to Hulk (2003, Eric Bana): Now onto Hulk comparisons. DISCLAIMER: I have not, did not, and probably will not watch the entirety of Hulk. But I have watched (mostly via fast-forward) a good 30 minutes of the film in question.So, based on my experience with it I will say this. The cinematography in the Incredible Hulk is much better than its older counterpart. For one in this 2008 reboot there are no split screens, no jello-like Hulk, and no weird Bed-nobs and Broomsticks-esque multi-hued screen flashes (when I say flashes I mean the screen doesn't cheaply changed color while silhouetting the actor with a stunned expression on his face. (And Bruce's father isn't strangely creeping about caressing poor, tortured Bruce's face in this version).
B001KF6FAI|4.0|I purchased this Tosca based on the two reviews posted herein and am certainly not sorry!  This is a very entertaining Tosca due to the excellent singing and acting.  I liked some of the sets but also found the lighting too dark to appreciate the production.  It also was disappointing to see her jump through the trapdoor in the stage at the end but I liked it enough that I overlooked this production flaw.  Dessi and hubbie Armiliato certainly have chemistry performing together (like their Girl of the Golden West too).  Raimondi is superb in whatever role he performs and seeing him in this Tosca proves the reason he was chosen for Scarpia for the world wide live telecast of several years ago with Domingo and Malfitano.  I have many Toscas on DVD because I really love this opera and certainly glad I added this one to the mix.  The movie is still my favorite but the Verona edition with Marton is in 2nd place.  The Alagnas' and this Tosca are in 3rd.  Highly recommend this for an excellent Tosca.
B00111WSNO|5.0|There is not much that has not been said regarding the highly acclaimed `Avantasia' albums so we will be focusing on the special features of this Gold edition and how this differs in comparison to their latest albums.<br /><br />`The metal opera Gold Edition' is an honorary 2008 release for the achievement of 300.000 sold copies of the Metal Opera pt1&2 albums. The release comes in a book-like hard cover case with a 48 page booklet including all lyrics, the entire storyline, an introduction by Tobias Sammet written in 2000 and a rather extensive interview with the mastermind himself. Evidently this release is a double CD pack including the `Metal Opera part 1' (1999) and `The Metal Opera part 2 (2000)'.<br /><br />As most are aware `Avantasia' takes form on the principle of multiple singers undertaking different play roles. In terms of musical direction, these first two `Avantasia' albums follow the power/speed metal sound as opposed to the later releases that mostly lean towards melodic hard rock (without being absolute). In fact the performing core of `Avantasia' of that time was built entirely on musicians from the power metal genre; including bassist Markus Grosskopf (`Helloween'), lead guitarist Henjo Richter (`Gamma Ray'), drummer Alex Holzwarth (`Rhapsody of Fire') and of course Tobias (`Edguy') on lead vocals.<br /><br />I do not think there is much reason in expanding on the relevance or credibility of these two albums as they have already reached classic status while their quality has been extensively analyzed and discussed over the previous years.<br /><br />This `Gold Edition' is a very complete- deluxe package of the first two `Avantasia' albums and a great opportunity for new fans to experience the earlier forms of this classic metal project.

B0019N8P2W|4.0|Given the fact that most of the original music is redone or missing in this series, it was actually a good thing that it took so long to release it.  How many of us actually remember what song went where anyway?  There is only one song that I completely miss, and that was Cake's \\"Daria\\" in the closing credits.    When it comes down to it, what most people remember about \\"Daria\\" is the wit.  There aren't many cartoons out there where the lead character is immersed in realism and the message isn't idealistic. Daria and Jane do not have rose colored glasses, which is interesting in a setting which the supporting cast of characters are full of stereotypes. You have the dumb cheerleader dating the dumb jock.  You have the smart artsy chick, the only popular people are shallow, the acne filled perv.  However, the show breaks stereotypes when 2 of the smartest and well balanced people in the show are African American.    The humor is smart.  One example of the jokes in this series can be found when the dumb jock and cheerleader are making out on a school bus.  Disgusted, the African American girl says, \\"Would Martin Luther King be offended if I moved back of the bus?\\"  You have to know who Martin Luther King was, and the significance of the back of the bus to the civil rights movement in the 1960's for this to be funny.    Although the original music is what put this series over the top, really the dialogue and attitude is what made this series great. I can't believe MTV forgot to get rights to new forms of media when creating this series instead opting for broadcast rights only.  This is the sole reason why I am not giving this 5 stars.  However, I must admit having the songs would have dated this material.  Now it is timeless and transcendent.  Not having the rights to reproduce the soundtrack may be a blessing in disguise.
B002LMOCDQ|5.0|Mamma Mia gift set is worth every penny. The movie and the songs move along seamlessly with beautiful scenery of Santorini. The blu-ray added depth and dimension to the movie. Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfried are great naturals; good singers and no pretense. I wish I could be in Santorini everyday of my life....
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|This collection of Michael Jackson music is definitely the Ultimate collection.  It has songs from the first album at the beginning of his career right through to the very last CD that he ever made.  If you truly love MJ, like I do, then this is something you would want for your collection.  It mixes the songs well, keeping the music consistent with the timeline.  Although it does include most of his best songs, it does add a few that didn't do too well during his J5 days, but they are still fun to listen to.  My only problem with the whole thing is that there wasn't enough room for more songs. Loved the video too!
0440242401|2.0|When I began this book I was entranced.  I couldn't wait to see what happened.  I was disappointed in the end.  With all of the build up that seemed like something fantastic was going to happen, it fell flat.  I felt like there was no closure.  After spending 365 pages building the story up, she spends just a short 24 with the ending.  I felt like she ran out of space and just wrapped it up in 3 sentences.  I did not feel like my questions were answered.  It was awful, I was disappointed.
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|I just discovered Chuck during Season 3 and since then I've been completely in love with the series.  I immediately ordered seasons 1 and 2 on DVD so I could catch up on all the backstory and have watched both seasons multiple times since receiving the DVDs.  The finale of Season 2 made for a great start to season 3 and it has been sheer brilliance from there.  Some of my absolute favorite episodes in the entire series have been in Season 3 (such as Chuck vs. The Other Guy and Chuck vs. The Honeymooners).  The writers and actors are of equal brilliance in this show - it comes together perfectly with an amazing blend of drama, comedy and romance.  I am so excited to see what the final few episodes of Season 3 will bring and, of course, I can't wait for Season 4 to begin.  I would (and have!) recommend this series... and this season... to anyone and everyone!  You won't be sorry.  Enjoy!
B0021L8V1G|4.0|As in the first Iron Man movie, Robert Downey Jr's personality comes across lots bigger than his physical person. The fast patter and winning wisecracks usually carry the movie when the comic-book effects don't - and there are some great effects. Paltrow's character, 'Pepper' Potts comes across with the right urgency and sincerity. Scarlett Johansson's spy babe fits that black catsuit flawlessly. Tony Stark's rival, Justin Hammer, creates a spoiled, whiny character with too much money for his own good - the kind you love to dislike, since he's not even evil enough to hate. And, of course, Mickey Rourke's 'Vanko' makes an electrifying badguy.<br /><br />Despite the great comic book styling, a few things fell flat. Comic book outsiders will scratch their heads over Nick Fury and SHIELD (\\"huh? where'd that come from?\\"). Everyone will scratch their heads over Potts's sudden promotion, once they see how Stark seems to undermine her (or try to) every time she tries to get the new job done. And, despite hints that he's not really as out of control as he seems, Stark being that out of control is just out of character - even RDJr's free-wheeling character.<br /><br />But, c'mon. You don't go to comic book movies for deep motivation or exploration of the human soul. You go for the BamPow goodness of a summer popcorn flick - and this offers plenty.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the relase to theaters<br /><br />(PS: The chemists out there already know that I really meant \\"Fe\\" in the title of this review - all others just take my word, it's no typo.)
B000002KZ6|4.0|Update- May 2, 2013.  Even though I've raised my rating from a 3 to a 4, my review still stands (with only minor changes).<br /><br />Actually let me state right away that Speaking in Tongues is probably a 3.5 rating because most of it *is* enjoyable, it's just that you have to be in a really good, energetic mood in order to fully appreciate an album like this.<br /><br />Most of the songs are completely stuck in dancing rhythms and beats (a style that was obviously quite popular throughout the 80's).  The problem is that I mostly like the Talking Heads for their highly unusual, quirky, and complex songwriting.  Speaking in Tongues mostly ignores all that.  Before this album was released, the Talking Heads were definitely one of the most innovative pop/rock bands of the late 70's.  This album is just... too normal by their standards, not to mention severely dated and stuck in the early 80's (right down to the yucky album cover).  You'll immediately be able to tell what year this music was made, no doubt about it.<br /><br />Most of the songs on Speaking in Tongues honestly blend together in my head the same way several other albums from the 80's blend together.  It's enjoyable music, but only mildly so.  Dancing is fun, but not when I wanna hear a Talking Heads album.  I wanna hear a Talking Heads album to absorb some creative and unique songwriting ideas.  With that said, there's a couple songs that stand out to me in a positive way.  \\"This Must Be the Place\\" reminds me of high school for some reason (even though I graduated 17 years after this albums release) and whether intentional or not, I sense a feeling of sadness in the way David Byrne sings the vocal melody.  I'm probably sensing the nervous/quivering way he sings, giving it an illusion of sadness.<br /><br />\\"Swamp\\" is amazing for the groovy bass and guitar work for one thing, and especially the \\"hi hi hi hi hi\\" portion, haha.  I LOVE that!  \\"Girlfriend Is Better\\" is the final song that stands out to me.Maybe *maybe* \\"Slippery People\\" stands out, but it's somewhat of a stretch I think.  \\"Moon Rocks\\" and \\"Pull Up the Roots\\" unfortunately fall in the same category and make up a rather large and uninspiring period of the 80's dance craze.<br /><br />As a result of the album being dominated with what I believe leans dangerously close to ordinary dance material, I can't really recommend this album to everyone sadly- only people who have a strong desire to build a collection of 80's dance material will get anything out of this.
B002JVWRAY|3.0|The Fifth Season of Supernatural COULD have been great, SHOULD have been great and WOULD have been great but instead it all felt like one big disappointment. It was like the writers come up with this great idea for a season arc, the Apocalypse and they either completely forget about it or really had no clue what they were doing in the first place.     As for the finale, well, let's just say I have read better fanfic than we what got. Everything that was built over last season and what we learned in this season in the end amounted to absolutely nothing and was completely retconned.    Adding Misha Collins to the cast as Castiel was a stroke of genius as he added some new blood to the series. However, I feel like his potential as a character was underused as he came off more as a guest star rather than a part of the main cast. While he did have some good eps. \\"Point Of No Return\\" being one of my personal favorites, I just felt like his character overall was not used to his full potential.      While there were some eps. that I really enjoyed like \\"Hammer of the Gods\\", \\"Changing Channels\\" and \\"The Song Remains The Same\\", the season as a whole lacked the dramatic tension and suspense that I was expecting. Perhaps I had my expectations set too high after that cliffhanger ending of the fourth season but in the end I can't help but feel disappointed in what I got.
B0000024PC|2.0|I bought it for the Simon and Garfunkle songs.  Should have bought a Simon and Garfunkle cd instead.  I don't really care for the rest of the music on the sound track.  I doubt I will ever listen to this cd again.  want to buy mine?

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|I have to write this this way, because this is how I saw it.<br /><br />My dad got four medals while he was in Korea: the UN/Korean, the Bronze Star, another one I can't remember, and the one he was most proud of: the Distinguished Flying Cross. That's 70+ successful combat missions.<br /><br />My dad had a stroke in 2005. He now has advanced dementia. He doesn't remember who he used to be. When I started watching this movie, I started crying because just like the Jack Nicholson charater in a \\"A Few God Men,\\" it was like seeing my father the way he was...not the way he is now, with advanced dementia, who can't remember anything but his childhood and his 20 years in the Marines.<br /><br />I wish my dad could go the way that Walt Kowalski did in this movie. He'd have appreciated it...if he could remember how and what, anyway.<br /><br />I'm only 36. I understood the main character as soon as I saw him, because he was in Korea duing the Korean War. Dad would've done the same thing.<br /><br />I like the movie.
B00004BZ16|5.0|Seriously, where to begin about \\"Sandinista!\\" other than yet another story from another quasi-punk who's life was profoundly influenced by it: This was THE album to have in my neighborhood during spring/summer 1980, now a mind blowing thirty years ago. We had no idea what reggae or dub was, couldn't have cared less about the genre spanning approach or production techniques. All we knew is that it was the new huge mega album by The Clash, and The Clash were about the coolest band ever.<br /><br />My first copy was on cassette, a two tape collective that dominated my portable Panasonic tape recorder and eventual component stereo from Sears well into high school. Without knowing it the album broadened my musical horizons to the extent that when I DID finally encounter forms of music like reggae, rockabilly, skiffle and doo-wop they were already welcome to my ears in part due to \\"Sandinista!\\"'s breadth of styles.<br /><br />I can only stress so much that at the time this was the big thing we absolutely did not care what The Clash might have come up with, listening regardless of how it didn't quite fit our expectations of a \\"punk\\" album. Heck that made it even more punk, the fact that some were annoyed by the indulgent attitude the band demonstrated of wanting to try everything at least once. It is the record's reckless sense of creativity that inspired me more than anything else, pushing the envelope beyond the orchestrated punk of \\"London Calling\\" and into genuine experimentation regardless of the outcome.<br /><br />As a youth it was the crossover genre hybrid songs like \\"One More Time/One More Dub\\", \\"Lightning Strikes (Not Once Buy Twice)\\", \\"Let's Go Crazy\\" the epic \\"Charlie Don't Surf\\" and especially \\"The Crooked Beat\\" that caught my ears. I had no idea what rap was, didn't know reggae from R&B, and for that matter didn't quite get the lyrics even if the leftist ideals filtered into my own social awareness. This was the album that introduced me to politics on a global scale, with the meanings of songs like \\"Ivan Meets G.I. Joe\\", \\"The Call Up\\" and \\"Washington Bullets\\" hammering their messages home with repeat listenings that my somewhat conservative parents found both alarming and provocative at the same time. They let me listen to \\"Sandinista!\\", where my Dead Kennedys and Sex Pistols records were routinely confiscated.<br /><br />Now listening as an adult it is the more wistful tracks that get repeat playings: \\"Something About England\\" now has a haunting quality that escaped me as a younger person, \\"The Street Parade\\" has become my favorite track and in my opinion they blew a potential hit single opportunity in passing over \\"The Kingston Advice\\" in favor of \\"Hitsville U.K.\\", a song I have never been very fond of. Not sure why, I always go for the underdog tracks.<br /><br />But whatever, the experimentation that led to \\"Hittsville U.K.\\" and \\"Magnificent Seven\\" also resulted in \\"Ivan Meets G.I. Joe\\", goofy \\"Look Here\\", the Bruce Springsteenish \\"Corner Soul\\", the surreal \\"Midnight Log\\" and all those reggae dub mixes with Mikey Dread. Some of it is a bit too much but then again that's what triple LPs are for. I admire The Clash for delivering a bit too much when they could have just done a halfassed job like so many other bands. At least they had the nerve to be willing to fail (\\"Lose This Skin\\" and my beloved \\"The Crooked Beat\\" haven't aged very well) which is the only way successful art can be executed. Hesitancy doesn't score you many fans.<br /><br />As you read over other reviews look at how many \\"stories\\" people have about how \\"Sandinista!\\" entered, changed, influenced and improved their lives. Here is a useful, utilitarian album that you'll find new things to hear from every time you put it on. The Clash should also be praised for their dogged determination to keep the cost of this album at a bargain rate. How many other bands would have jacked up the price for CD? At $17 retail the two disc set is a steal. You won't regret picking it up, and to harken back to something Bill Cosby used to say, if you're not careful you just might learn something by listening to it.Bill Cosby used to say, if you're not careful you just might learn something by listening to it.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|This is unquestionably one of my top 3 movies of all time, absolutely hilarious. John Goodman really makes this movie great in my opinion. Who would have thought a story about a guy and his rug could be so awesome? I am not a big fan of widescreen, but this movie is worth getting on Special Edition DVD. I HIGHLY recommend this movie, The Coen brothers always have made excellent movies! This one though, is their best.

B0017KIBAI|5.0|Silly Amazon.com, this is a gamecube controller!    The extra feet on the cable make it vastly preferable to the original GCN controllers, and the white-only color scheme will let you know which of your friends actually wash their hands before playing.  So, I guess it's a strict improvement over the GCN controller.
0307454541|2.0|I'm glad I didn't buy the entire series at once. This book was rather boring for the first 150 or so pages. It deals with the history of the family, most of which really has no bearing on the storyline. It was basically 150-175 pages (I can't remember exactly when it started to become interesting) of a family tree. There are way too many charachters (family members) to keep straight, most of which as far as I could tell served no purpose.<br /><br />I found myself wanting to finish this book simply because I had already invested so much time in reading it.  By the time everything was solved, I was rather disappointed. I wasn't surprised at who did it although the reasons for it were rather \\"crazy\\". I just wanted this book to be over.  I ultimately did end up liking Lisbeth but not enough to read the next installment right away, if ever.
B001GKJ2DY|4.0|I watched this movie on a plane ride to Asia.  I admit that I really did not want to - I didn't know ABBA well and I did not hear good reviews.  But this was one good thing I discovered in that long plane ride.  It was surprisingly entertaining and made me want to dance!  I know the plot is very weak and very unrealistic - one star off for that - (come on, who would go to an old lover's daughter wedding when you have not spoken for 20 years??), but I had so much fun.  I now own the soundtrack and love blasting it.  And every couple months or so, I catch it on HBO since it always puts me in a great mood.  Pierce Brosan is a bit hard to listen to, but Meryl Streep makes it up for him!!  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who just wants to have a good time!
B000QFBW6K|4.0|This was one of the best acted and sung Ring's I've seen and heard. Tomlinson as Wotan is fantastic. Anne Evans as Brunnhilde carried things vocally and was an attractive stage presence. For a person who grew up on Hildegard Behrens' belching for The Met it's great to listen to a pleasing Brunnhilde. Siegfried Jerusalem as Siegfried was a pleasant surprise. I didn't like him much in The Met's production, but the Bayreuth air must agree with him. He nails his performances, both visually and vocally. Phillip Kang is decent as Hagen but needs more lung to match the likes of Matti Salminen. Then again, who's better than Salminen? The production is predictably schlocky in that familiar Euro-trash way, but at least the vision is consistent throughout the four operas. Too many modern productions simply don't cohere through the 15 hours, so desperate are directors/producers to rub our faces in their anarchic vision. For me, the stripped down staging in sections like the 3rd Act of Siegfried helped focus viewers attention on the fine acting, so it was no great loss that I didn't see a full blown flaming Brunnhilde's rock. I thought the Rhein maiden scene at the start of the cycle was great. They actually looked like they were swimming in the green light. Stage designers should take greater advantage of modern light projection techniques, including holograms, to build more compelling Rings. How many times has Fafner the dragon looked ridiculous on stage, a problem that's bedeviled production since the first performance when Wagner was alive? The text keeps assuring us that Fafner is the most terrifying vision on earth and then we get flailing paper mache claws and a cartoon head. We the viewers should be scared of Fafner, making Siegfried's bravery more impressive. Modern lighting could project a frightening, almost 3-D Fafner, if they'd just give up on the creaky contraptions. Same thing with Grane, Brunnhilde's horse, an animal that's repeatedly referenced but never seen believably. Project a shimmering version of Grane with modern lighting and forget about hobby horses and other cutesy stuff. Overall, I thought this production the most satisfying I'd seen on video.

B002ZCDR88|5.0|Inspired by her attempt to share in and enrich the imaginative space of  her 6 year old daughter, this translation of poetry written for children by both minor and major authors into musical songs, is completely faithful to both the text and mood of the originals.Some of these poems are better known to the general public than others but all are carefully selected and richly represent the genre.It is clearly a labor of love.It is also a masterpiece that will endure and help to keep this magical space alive in the hearts of both children and adults alike.This is the achievement of an artist working at the full extent of her considerable abilities.Superbly crafted musically, with wonderful sound production, the  double cd is beautifully packaged.An accompanying little book fitted into the cd package contains pictures of the poets, original texts of the poems and supporting information.The quality of production here  is also superb not to say, almost unheard of today in this format.Merchant says that she tapped into new  interests and abilities but one can see how they might have developed in the artist and singer who once fronted 10.000 Maniacs.We should be grateful for what has resulted.I urge everyone to buy this cd as fast as they possibly can and to see that copies get into the hands of as many children and friends as possible.It can only help to foster  the delight and childlike wonder at the world which serves to keep us all human.Thank you Nathalie.
B002ZCY7QY|5.0|At this point, I'm sure most people reading this (three seasons in) have been watching Chuck on television, and I don't need to explain it's merits. It's a mix of comedy and drama, with an undercurrent of the will they/won't they story telling that Josh Schwartz is known for. For me, this season has been on par with Season 2; never surpassing it, but never sinking below the bar that Season 2 set. Had this been the last season of the show, that wouldn't have sat as well with me, but seeing as how Chuck has been renewed for a fourth season, the possibilities of a new season have erased any small quibbles I had with this season (the Shaw character, Morgan finding out...things like that).

0061914177|5.0|Many of us -- hell, maybe MOST of us -- have a great idea for a business inside of us. It might not be a big business. It might, in fact, be very small. But, regardless of size or scope, what we lack (again, not all of us, but many of us) is the courage and the tools to make the dream of our ideas a reality. What Gary Vaynerchuk's CRUSH IT provides is the tools necessary to get started, and the inspiration necessary to take a good idea and make it a great one. Reading it also gave me courage, and a great deal of it.

It arrived much later than the original date, but that was due to circumstances beyond their control.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|The good news; This Blu-ray is as awesome as claimed. The bad news, after I watched this movie on my panasonic BD85P & panasonic P65V10, every other movie looked like VHS quality in comparison. The visuals are stunning and the sound in 7.1 through the SONY DH-810 & Harmon Kardom HKTS-18 (with the KHS-9s of course), we may never go to the movie theather again. Great story, movie is a bit long but enjoyable. A must have for anyone who has upgaded to the HD experience
B0006399FS|5.0|When it comes to U2 albums, it seems that nearly all of them are surrounded by controversy. Which one best represents the band's message, their evolution, their growth? As a relative newcomer to the Irish supergroup, it's an argument that I've stayed away from. I tend not to look at music for its evolutionary value but for one thing: do I like it or not? And when it comes to \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\", I like it.    Upon first hearing 'Vertigo', I thought that the band had picked up right where they left off after 2000's \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\". The song seemed to be a relative of 'Elevation', though with more melody and energy. The rest of the album is more rock-oriented than its predecessor, though. In fact, to me, much of the album nods back to the 2000 release; 'Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own' is a near-rewrite of 'Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of', though with a gorgeous guitar backing and slightly more desperate feel. However, this one isn't a strict copy. The guitar riffs here echo throughout the record, and while the pattern ties everything together, it doesn't bore. Some of the highlights include 'Miracle Drug', 'City of Lights', and 'Yahweh', which, like so many U2 songs, speaks of spirituality.    I think to understand this album, you have to listen to it. Yes, it's wrapped neatly with a bow. Yes, some of the musical elements carry through all of the songs. But is that a bad thing? I don't think so. Maybe it's because I'm not a U2 fan from back when they first started (I wasn't born yet). But it's an album with thought-provoking lyrics and great melodies. What more could you want?
B000ULQV0W|5.0|If I were ever forced to pick only one album to listen to for the rest of my life, it would be this soundtrack. This is an amazing collection of songs that I believe transcend the movie. \\"Society\\", and \\"Guaranteed\\" are beautifully done and are true testament to Eddie Vedder's talents as both a songwriter and musician. At a time when so much of the music produced is manufactured pop dribble, this is truly a refreshing standout. This is the type of work that gives me hope that music with meaning is not lost forever.

B002JH3TW8|5.0|When I bought my MacBook Pro I failed to realize at the time that the firewire port is an 800. I was still producing music on my oldschool G4, but I recently decided it was time to move the studio on to the new book. My M-audio firewire 1418 works better than ever on my MacBook Pro with this adapter and the updated drivers for OS X Intel. I was worried that it would not receive power through the bus, but it works flawlessly. The best part is the flexible connector, which I didn't see with some of the other options. This was the perfect solution; I highly recommend it to anybody else that needs to use a firewire 400 device on their MacBook Pro (although I haven't tried anything else yet).

0307120007|2.0|Our children (now mid 30's) had enjoyed the original Pat the Bunny book.  I saw this version on Amazon and ordered it for our granddaughter.  The quality was not the same as I had remembered.  The original had sturdy cardboard pages that were substantial and held up for many years, I am sure.  This newly printed version is smaller and the pages are two thin pages held together at the back with a plastic spiral.  I ordered this product for a birthday gift and did not see the product until it was received just prior to the birthday.  I was disappointed in the quality and advised the shipper.<br /><br />We were given a refund on the purchase price.
B00009W0WM|5.0|This is such a classic tale of love, heroism and self denial. It is a wonderfully constructed story of love and a tribute to the golden age of fine acting when beauty wasn't measured by exposed skin or sleazy performance.<br /><br />This is a must have classic, if not for the story, the performance, or the music, then for the love theme:<br />\\"You must remember this, a kiss is still a kiss, a sigh is just a sigh, the fundamental things apply<br />As time goes by, and when two lovers woo, they still say, \\"I love you\\", on that you can rely, no matter what the future brings\\"
0385737947|4.0|I rather enjoyed the plot of this book, even with its plot gaps and rushed ending.<br /><br />It's a story of a bunch of boys who live in the middle of a perpetually shifting maze with deadly monsters because they are part of an experiment that they are not aware they are in.  Thomas and Theresa, the two latest newcomers to the Glade, where they live, trigger the 'ending,' which forces all of them to find the exit to the maze.<br /><br />I found the story interesting, even if the characters are a bit annoying, especially with Thomas having no faults, and the unlikeable leader, Alby (how did he become leader when he's so unlikeable?)  The most likable characters in this book are Minho and Newt, secondary characters, who were one of the most fleshed out characters.<br /><br />Even so, there are only two points in this story that truly bother me.  There are so many boys in the Glade, but only a mere handful are given names, so it really felt like there were only a handful of boys.  If the author doesn't pay attention to them, why would the reader?<br />And near the end of the story, without trying to give away any spoilers, Alby does something that is contradicted by an action of Minho's.  What was Alby doing all night then...?<br /><br />But I did like the cliff hanger ending.  I hope my guesses will be proved correct in the next book!<br /><br />My only question is... if all the boys are named after an inventor of sorts, who is Minho named after?
B000063UR2|2.0|Typically, films center around a basic, logical, plot throwing point. You set up a cast of characters, create obstacles for them, torture them, then let them get married. Usually, if you're Steven Spielberg or J. J. Abrams, the use of aliens or strange creatures from even stranger islands come into play.<br /><br />Legend is a............ good idea(?) but has a pretty fatal, damaging problem.<br /><br />Its....boring.<br /><br />Although it contains many fantasy elements and even pulls a few of them off, Legend fails in its primal, basic idea. A girl lives in the forest ( a kind of sleeping beauty before being put to sleep). She's the most beautiful girl in the world. PERIOD. We believe that quite quickly because she shimmers like a Christmas tree through most of the film. She's also the epitome of INNOCENCE. We are (I seem to recall though I might be wrong) told this through a booming, fatherly, somewhat creepy yet authoritative voice over.  Heres the part where it loses its primal basic idea...  The innocent girl, meets the dreamy, steamy, fourteen year old, gorgeous hair Tom Cruise standup doll in the forest... and they immediately begin to \\"get it on\\", if you get my meaning.<br /><br />I do not like being told that a character is the epitome of Innocence and Purity while I watch her lie to her guardian (who apparently was only created to serve the girl and therefore doesn't deserve to be treated with respect) as she sneaks out to have hanky pankys with Tom Cruise. Who later becomes the head of a strange religion that believe aliens will come back to take our bodies or some crud like OH MAN THIS IS A SPIELBERG FILM!<br /><br />Oops, I strayed into real life. My bad.<br /><br />There are NO aliens in this film. There probably should have been. It would have provided a bit more content. Rather then us watching Satan, who is watching the girl and Tom Cruise who are getting it on.<br /><br />Anys, apparently Satan has a lot of time on his hands because he kidnaps the fair maiden.

Since after kidnapping her and dragging her to hell he is powerless to do anything untoward to her without her permission. Yes.... I understand! Its because she's innocent, isn't it?! I get it now!<br /><br />Back to the...... plot.<br /><br />Tom Cruise fights Satan for girl and wins!! Oog Oog! Also, a group of semi sentient beings (fairies and pixies and other creatures) get minor air time!<br /><br />Now the only good thing about this film is hearing Tim Curry's voice come out of Satan. I mean... that is WEIRD!! I love Tim Curry (most of the time) but even he can't make up for the horrible lines that he HIMSELF is saying! Watching Satan try to seduce a young girl is not fun.

0689865384|3.0|I picked this up because of the sample provided here, and the raving reviews given by others.  The idea of a world where everyone turns 'pretty', holds so much potential in our current society.<br /><br />But this idea falls flat.  There was no connection to the characters.  They may have been well fleshed out, but I didn't care whether or not they stayed ugly, became pretty, or fell off a cliff.  Also, why would anyone not want to become pretty?  The author wrote up a utopia where people all had self esteem (no problems of anorexia, and etc.), where society had connected to nature and didn't destroy it, where there was no poverty, starvation, and no wars.<br />Sure, they may all have been vapid, but it was not convincing enough that it was better to be an individual, instead of accepting all the positive changes that this new society had implemented.  The author wrote too perfect a utopia to convince the reader that it needed to be broken.<br /><br />The selling point to this novel is the idea.  The idea of making everyone look the same, not just pretty, the technological ideas of the hoverboards and anti-gravity suits, the idea of the old society, our present society, failing, being too dependent on oil, destroying nature, making way for this well-constructed new one, where everyone is in tune with nature, and have no need to wage war on each other.
B003ELKNOK|1.0|I agree that this \\"new\\" re releases are just a waste of money, so save it!  I would imagine that only collectors would like to buy them, because most fans have previous versions already, but what's new with these ones? Nothing! It would be still worth it if the live tracks were never previously released, something really new, but why spend more money to have the Wanted (album version) and Wanted (live)?  They entice fans with the \\"vault\\" content, but... inside are pictures and one more song, that you can listen to, but if you want it, you have to pay more. Each CD has the key to a different one, so if you want to see what else is there, you have to buy ALL the CDs. Money making idea at it's best!    If someone is interested in real \\"new\\" content, I totally recommend the Box Set (100 million fans can't be wrong), released in 2004, with 4 CDs (rare and never before released tracks) and 1 DVD.     One more detail, there seem to be 2 different types of packaging offered with these CDs, a hard cardboard cover and the usual plastic cases. The advertised backstage passes ONLY come with the cardboard ones, (more expensive in price I believe), so... Beware.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Amazing book. This book has the most action, all the loose ends are tied...  I think this book is the best in the series. But its always sad hwena series ends.  Again, very good book.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|I can see why so many do not like this cd, but I stand with the people who really did enjoy it. The music is kind of euphoric and very reminiscent of childhood. To those saying that this CD is childish and meant for a predominantly \\"kid\\" audience, I feel you are mistaken. Although the lyrics are obviously famous nursery rhymes, the melodies seem very adult and mature. They can be enjoyed by any age: children will admire the lyrics while older listeners will appreciate the power this music has to transport them back to their childhood without feeling like babies while listening to it. There is a reason Natalie Merchant did not make her music sound like something straight out of a Baby Einstein video. What is music anyway? It's poetry. Just because these songs are not tackling themes of love, break-ups, happiness, depression, or any other universal so-called \\"adult\\" theme, does not diminish its overall integrity good music. Natalie Merchant is putting poetry--which happens to be nursery rhymes--into a beautiful mucical form, and she does it masterfully. I don't bash anyone who did not like this CD, but I do ask that the ones who butchered it try and listen to it one more time with a different perspective, because the music Natalie Merchant creates is pretty amazing.
B000089770|2.0|I am not a car-chase and explosion guy.  I like intelligent movies that provoke thought, so I came to this movie based on what I read about it here on Amazon.  I thought it would be perfect for me.  I was wrong. This movie is well-acted.  There are moments of freshness, and I very much liked the scene in which Auggie and Paul are looking through Auggie's photo albums. I thought then this would be a special movie, but I was disappointed. Three-quarters of the way through, I was still waiting for another scene like the early one that really hooked me.  I didn't find one, and I had no idea why I was watching the film.  I understand this is a \\"slice of life film,\\" and I understand the metaphor of the title, \\"Smoke,\\" but this movie dissipates too rapidly, is a little too insubstantial. I was never really engaged by the characters; I never really was able to get behind the facade, so to speak.  Throughout the film, I didn't really care whether I saw it through to the end or not, though I will say the ending was nice as a stand-alone.  It was not enough to make the movie worthwhile.

0385528752|4.0|I am a big fan of the Heath brother's books.  Switch is definitely another winner, but it is no Made to Stick.  Switch gives the 3 concepts to making a change, and is chock full of case studies that support it.  The analogy is a little confusing for me.  The Rider & The Elephant represent two of the three major components of change according to the authors.  I think it would have been clearer if it was simply explained as what it is, will power (which fades fast) and routine (which is hard to change, but can last indefinitely).    I definitely recommend the read, it is good... really good, in fact, but not the best.  Then again to top Made To Stick is near impossible. That book is absolutely great and a must read.

B00000342V|5.0|The real world of soul/r & b lost a creative genius in the late Curtis Mayfield (died later after a scaffolding accident paralyzed him). This album is truly one of his greatest achievements, besides being a high-quality (not manufactured) movie score to define the genre of blaxploitation (a term I generally despise) movies. The late Ron O'Neal played Priest, a dealer who wanted to make one more score and leave the business behind for good, but certain people he was in with refused to let him go. A partner that would double-cross him to The Man, down to Freddie, who was killed by a car while fleeing from police for possession. Mayfield and his group did have a cameo in this film and every song represents the mood or course of the main characters, such as \\"Freddie's Dead\\", \\"Eddie You Should Know Better\\", and \\"Pusherman\\" explains \\"what you need\\". The title tune, used at the end of the film, shows Priest gettting the last word on corrupt cops who want to keep him trapped in the rackets, but he takes out the ultimate insurance policy for his well-being. Originally released on Curtom (Mayfield's own record label), this belongs in the Soundtrack Hall Of Fame, along with the likes of \\"Shaft\\", \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" and \\"Titanic\\". So does the movie! See it and you'll know why. Gordon Parks was The Best (Also directed the \\"Shaft\\" Trilogy, MGM/Sony). He was killed in a plane crash. (Curtom/Ichiban/Rhino)
0439023483|5.0|With all the buzz surrounding 'The Hunger Games', I've half a mind to believe it's all an exaggeration. It's not the first time that a novel purported to be all the rage turn out to be so-so after I've tried my hand in it (like 'Water for Elephants' and 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower').<br /><br />(Don't worry, I myself was disappointed with my own reaction to those.)<br /><br />But then I later found myself still sitting up into the late hours of the night, turning page after page of Collins' novel. It was gripping. Adrenalin-pumped. Throw in all the clich&eacute;s. The point is this is a highly-enjoyable read. Really.<br /><br />It poses questions on the threshold of being human and the probability and capacity to do something unspeakable when it is one's life and survival at stake.<br /><br />What lengths would a group of people be willing to go through in order to enforce an ideology? How is fear and subservience conditioned? And when does TV and reality cease to become distinguishable?<br /><br />Intensely psychological, the Hunger Games held regularly in the wasteland that was North America to keep people on the line strike at the very heart of the descent into dystopia. Teenagers are plucked and made to battle each other to the death in a controlled environment, with a victory signaling food and comforts for the winner's District - that is, until the next Hunger Games.<br /><br />In a lot of ways, this is one of those novels that serve as a wake-up call to the shenanigans that people nowadays are occupying themselves with. If went unchecked, the premise of shows like `Survivor' - where betrayal and the constant need to serve only one's own interest is highly encouraged - will be taken to extremes, all for the name of entertainment and who knows what else (Food? Shelter? Safety?).<br /><br />This is a highly-recommended read. Interspersed with its healthy dose of excitement (and even grim, morbid undertones) is a story of a young girl who was forced to sacrifice a shred of her humanity for the sake of her starving family back home and her newfound friends in the arena, Rue and Peeta. The fate of Rue, especially, made me cry.<br /><br />And when there are waterworks, well...that only means one thing.<br /><br />I loved it.mily back home and her newfound friends in the arena, Rue and Peeta.

0525421580|4.0|have you ever tried to tell a story with someone else?  it's no easy task.  and even though i am a huge fan of john green (an abundance of katherines, looking for alaska, paper towns) and i really enjoyed david levithan's boy meets boy, and even though i was really looking forward to reading will grayson, will grayson, i also braced myself for disappointment (especially since i splurged and bought it hardcover).    it turns out there was no need:  this is another great book by each/both of these authors.  they gave an interview that talked a bit about their writing and revision process:  each author wrote about one of the wills.  (if you've read either of their works before, it's pretty clear who wrote which one.  in a good way.)    as someone with a common name, i have met 7,348 other lisas so far (one of the reasons i named my first born something  less-well-known, i.e. almost unpronounceable ), but it would be strange indeed to meet someone with the exact same name.  the two will graysons, who live in different suburbs of chicago, meet by accident.    the will grayson we meet first is considering his friendship with tiny cooper (`not the world's gayest person, and he is not the world's largest person, but i believe he may be the world's largest person who is really, really gay, and also the world's gayest person who is really, really large.')  he and tiny have been best friends since 5th grade and have pretty much taken care of each other.  lately, tiny has been falling in and out of love at an alarming (to will) rate-and each time, will gets put on the back burner.  will, who considers himself `practical' when it comes to feelings (he has `not cried since my seventh birthday ... i don't really understand the point of crying.') follows two rules.    `1. don't care too much.  2.  shut up.'    tiny cares a lot and talks a lot.  he's even writing a musical for the high school to preform called tiny dancer.    meanwhile in a suburb far, far away, is another will grayson.  this will lives with his mother, has a frenemy named maura, and a cyberboyfriend named isaac.  (maura is a kind of a wretch, and it seems as though an author who would come up with a screen name for isaac called `boundbymydad' in reference to the sacrifice, would know the name maura means bitter and i found that intentionality bit much.)  other than that, he's a loner.  he meets tiny through the other will grayson (o.w.g.) and tiny brings his warm world of love into will's life.    there are many themes in this book-love, friendship, tolerance, emotional risk-taking.  it also touches on technology-there is a lot of texting/im-ing, and identity plays a large role.  the characters are well-rounded, compassionate, and complicated.  the adults are treated kindly (the parents are not jerks just because they are parents).  i am not sure how likely it is that someone like tiny would be so accepted in high school these days, but it's been a long time since i graduated, and it would be nice to think some of those horrible things have changed.  the one thing i have any issue with has to do with one of the will's depression.  there are references to medication and depression, but that theme is never really followed and as an adult reader, it was hard to see that this will grayson's mental health stuff was any worse than any other teenangster...it might have been helpful/more insight-providing to have just a wee bit more on that.    and for those wondering what oddball trait john green's character may have, that's a bit of a disappointment-no anagrams, no famous last words.  the character is amusing and introspective and often tongue-tied-i was looking for his quirk.    i really enjoyed this book, and would recommend it for older ya readers and adults.  there is no violence (well, maybe a punch thrown) and no graphic sex.  there are references to drugs and alcohol, fake ids, ditching school.    © 2010, lisa port white.

014241543X|5.0|I'm not big on reading \\"tear jerkers\\" but this story is more than that. Forman does a wonderful job of bringing you into the main character's world without wallowing in grief. You learn about Mia and her family (which is something we know to mean more than blood relations)through Mia's memories which are beautifully told.     A lesser writer would have taken the easy way out with this story and exploited the tragedy of it but Forman doesn't do that. She doesn't use the obvious misery of the situation to draw you in, instead she lets you in on Mia's most intimate thoughts and feelings and that's how you come to understand what Mia has lost and also what she has to live for.    This is one of the most touching stories I've read in a while. I will definitely be looking forward to Gayle Forman's next book!
B00004S6GL|5.0|Figure 8 is another brilliant release from a complex, intelligent songwriter who died too young. Figure 8 is one of Smith's most accessible releases, boasting memorable melodies/harmonies and intricate songwriting, with nuances and density that give Elliott Smith songs their edge.

Smith's brain may have been wired differently - as a result, I'm often asking, \\"how did he come up with that?\\" If you're your ears perk with interest upon hearing occasional alternative twists and turns or unexpected chord progressions in your music, Elliott Smith is for you, and Figure 8 is a great place to start.

B000BBOUU4|2.0|In general, I enjoy classic movies and I also generally hate remakes.  Unfortunately, this is no exception.    There is very little magic in this movie as there was in the original.  Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willie Wonka is very different than Gene Wilder's.  It is dark and mysterious, sometimes he comes off as downright cruel.  The entire movie seems rushed and forced, and the unneeded sub-plots don't help.  Also, the oompa-loompas did not impress me.      In short, this movie is strange, and very different from the original.  Stick to the classic version that we all know and love.

0307408833|1.0|Like other reviewers, I pre-ordered this book when a friend told me about it. I was so excited, and made up a couple of the recipes, following the instructions to the letter. What a let down! The muffins and cupcakes were so dry! The frosting was disappointing too.    At first I thought it was just me, and the way I was making up the recipes (even though I've been baking for years). However, at a friend's birthday party, the hostess ordered cupcakes from Babycakes specially for my daughter, who refused to eat them. The chocolate cupcake was, quite frankly, inedible; and she turned the other two (vanilla and one other kind) down flat - and this is not a child to turn her back on sweet treats! So much for Babycakes.     I was also stunned to see an entire chapter of spelt recipes, in a book that boasts of being \\"gluten free.\\" If you go to the trouble of adding the qualifier \\"mostly sugar free,\\" why can't you put \\"mostly gluten free\\" on the cover? Ever hear of truth in advertising? Apparently not. We can get gluten-full recipes anywhere, any time. What a sham!    This book has everything, or so it would seem: glossy photos worthy of a fashion magazine; celebrity endorsements and beautiful photography. What it doesn't have is honest-to-goodness recipes that can stand alone and speak for themselves.    For a no-nonsense approach to gluten-free cooking that gets the job done, and doesn't require a ton of ingredients, I would recommend \\"The Best Ever Wheat- and Gluten-Free Baking Book\\" by Mary Ann & Mace Wenniger; or \\"Flying Apron's Gluten-Free & Vegan Baking Book\\" by Jennifer Katzinger. These books are great: no hype, fewer ingredients, and, for the most part, great results. Bon appetit!

B002N57W9C|5.0|I was so excited to see Amazon offering the import of the entire collection of Roxette remastered CDs. Roxette is a criminally overlooked pop band these days and this CD is where it all started. I'm sure you've heard of the Minneapolis exchange student who was studying in Sweden and came back with this masterpiece and got the local radio station to start playing \\"The Look\\" and really helped launched this band here in the states. This CD is pop music perfection from beginning to end and it's so wonderful to have a copy of the entire CD with a much cleaner mix. Now I've tried to compare this CD pressing with my older copies of Look Sharp and it's a little hard to tell if it's a true remaster or just a volume increase. Either way, it sounds great and is a worthy addition to my Roxette collection!<br /><br />A few words on this product, be aware all the remastered CDs come in cardboard sleeves, no plastic cases. So you have to be extra careful handling them if you don't want them scratched. Also, if you're a die hard Roxette collector like me, getting these CDs is a no-brainer, but for those just wondering how different these sound compared to the earlier CD pressings. Once you get past Crash! Boom! Bang! the audio quality is INCREDIBLY hard to tell the difference between each CD. I compared the 2001 Room Service CD and the 2009 Remaster and there is really no difference at all that I could tell. But if you're a fan, pick them up. The import price is so reasonable!<br /><br />I really miss Roxette and the incredible songs they would make. Just listening to this CD brings back so many memories and happy feelings. What a great band and what a wonderful CD!
0812550706|5.0|Ender's game has the one thing that so many imitator's lack, and this is voice.  Other military space adventures like Starship troopers and Forever war have the same engrossing narrative, but Ender's game supercedes all the rest.  Andrew Wiggins is a likeable hero caught in a fascinating situation.  He uses his intellect and his charisma to fight his way past very tough odds.  Following him through his struggles is great entertainment, and I was glad to revisit this book and find that it stands the test of time very well.
B000AP04MO|5.0|Ever wonder what became of Audrey Hepburn's romantic heroines, in for example \\"Sabrina\\", \\"Funny Face\\" or \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\", once the movie ended and they were on their way to \\"happily ever after\\"?   If so, then you definitely want to view \\"Two for the Road\\", which takes her character Joanna Wallace past the charming courtship, the blissful falling in love, and into the marriage itself over approximately a 12 year span.  The marital journey taken by her husband Mark Wallace played by Albert Finney and she is not always on a smooth, broad ribbon of road, but one sometimes dotted with potholes, bumps and detours.   In other words it's a real marriage, not a fairy tale.      Joanna and Mark, both young English tourists travelling in France meet by accident, literally.  Thrown together by circumstance, the two hitchhike across the verdant French countryside and in the process fall in love and begin an idyllic affair, which leads to marriage.  However the novelty of the film is that we never see the Wallaces back in their native England in their everyday milieu; rather we experience their marriage through four separate vacations in France where they drive through and revisit some of the haunts from their initial trip.   A greater innovation is that these trips are not shown chronologically or consecutively.   Rather they criss-cross back and forth, interrupt one another, and follow their own path, a particular memory may have an association with another from a different time.   This is very real and quite natural, and not at all confusing.  The astute viewer will be able to follow the time sequences quite easily if need be by just noting the changes in Audrey Hepburn's hairstyles and the different cars used.     This is the most romantic film about a couple travelling together since Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert took to the road in \\"It Happened One Night\\".   The French scenery is lush, sunlit (most of the time) and gorgeous, nature all in bloom; the filming must have taken place from May thru July.   There is an unspoiled, secluded beach cove for the lovers to cavort and cuddle, which unfortunately will be developed by Mark into a chic private playground for the idle rich.   The French Tourist Board should have paid a fee to the filmmakers since I'm sure this movie boosted tourism in a big way.  I know when I first saw this film on television back when I was seventeen, I wanted to travel the French highways and byways, and find my own Audrey Hepburn or Jacqueline Bisset (there in a brief early cameo)!  The screenplay by Frederic Raphael is witty and artful, comic yet tender, yes you will laugh, but you also will have a tug or two on your heartstrings, as Joanna and Mark weather the vicissitudes of married life.  Above all, it rings true in an honest portrayal of marriage being something a couple must both work at for success, but if you both can share a private smile and a laugh through it all you're halfway there!     If \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" is director Stanley Donen's musical masterpiece, then \\"Two for the Road\\" is certainly his dramatic one; he has done none better before or since.  Ditto for the musical score by Henry Mancini, it is just glorious, almost like a third character with the couple highlighting and underscoring the action with euphoric strings for the joyous moments and muted horns for the shadowed ones.   My favorite moment is where the music peaks rapturously as Joanna and Mark arrive on the beach breathless, and cling to each other in an ardent kiss their bodies as one silhouetted against a brilliant fireball of a sunset, and Joanna utters the title line of this review.  The title theme immediately sets the mood, it is everything it should be lyrical, poignant, bittersweet and unashamedly romantic, and it is repeated most skillfully in key moments.    Before moving on to the performances of the principal players, some brief words about the supporting cast.  Eleanor Bron and William Daniels as a pretentious, self absorbed American couple; Cathy and Howard Maxwell-Manchester,\\"friends\\" of Mark's, nail  their parts down, particularly the British Ms. Bron who does a truly flawless American princess accent.   The newlywed Wallaces have the trip from hell as they travel together with them and their appalling moppet of a daughter Ruthie, who is in the top five most horrible movie kids of all time.   As mentioned earlier this is one of Jacqueline Bisset's first movie roles, in a tiny part as Jackie one of Joanna's choirgirl friends, and she is as luscious as a ripe peach, definitely jump starting my teenage libido the first time I saw her way back when!        At times Albert Finney's Mark is difficult to like since he doesn't always appreciate what a marvelous woman he has in Joanna, and doesn't treat her as well as he should.   But Mr. Finney paints with sure strokes a strong portrait going from callow youth to the older disillusioned husband, and you always feel he loves Joanna in his own fashion even if he doesn't always appreciate her.  He has a potent electricity with Ms. Hepburn; you truly believe them as a couple besotted with one another.     Best for last; this is after \\"The Nun's Story\\", Audrey's Hepburn's most extraordinary performance, she creates cinema magic in her role as Joanna Wallace.   The timeless, enchanting charm is there as always as the young virginal Joanna.   However, she brings an added dimension as Joanna enters clear-eyed into her love affair with Mark, showing Joanna's own passion and desire.  In one scene Mark and she are playfully tussling, which changes into something stronger, as they gaze hungrily at each other  a soft sound, kind of a sigh mixed with a purr escapes her.   This is one sexy woman, as she is throughout the film.  She transitions effortlessly into the young wife, loving mother, and rueful woman who is trying to make sense of her life.   At the time of filming, Ms. Hepburn's own marriage to Mel Ferrer was on the rocks, and she brings a personal sense of heartache and depth of feeling into the older Joanna who is trying to salvage her own marriage.   Joanna is the stronger, more interesting character of the two, although Mark is the architect, she builds the relationship and is continually the \\"fixer\\" of their lives.  As always she looks exquisite, but no Givenchy this time, Stanley Donen wanted a simpler wardrobe for her character, although as the older more affluent woman, her clothes and hairstyle become more chic and expensive, very \\"mod\\" in the mid 1960's styles, particularly one mini-dress covered in shiny, metallic discs.   This performance is so Oscar worthy, she was nominated that year but for her taut, besieged blind woman in \\"Wait Until Dark\\", which was well deserved, too bad the latter didn't open the next year, so she could have been nominated for this one as well.   Still, it was the other Hepburn, Katharine, won a sympathy Oscar that year for \\"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\\", a damned injustice.     The only extras are Stanley Donen's commentary, which is well worth a listen, the original trailer, and a still gallery.  Regardless, try this film, like the Wallaces, this is one trip you'll want to revisit over and over again.
B002UNMW7O|4.0|This is a good movie to put it simply. It's not in the same caliber as the first Boondock Saints, but it didn't disappoint. Decent plot, decent acting, only thing i could gripe about would be the soundtrack. It just didn't seem to fit. What's nice is that it goes into the history of their father and brings more background like that in. Also, keeping most the characters from the first movie was a highlight.

1416594787|3.0|Dr Richard Dawkins is an accomplished popular science writer, learned evolutionary biologist (PhD, Oxford), and avid athiest. This fascinating text is quite engaging, loaded with scientific commentary and the latest information concerning the progess of the theory of evolution. Dr Dawkins presents an extensive layman's explanation of the evolutionary process as he understands it and what evidence has led him to conclude that evolution is \\"fact\\". Unfortunately, he does take for granted some crucial areas that are actually still in contestation about the theory, attempting to sell evolution as an air-tight deal. I approached this book with the aspiration to learn more about this subject (which I certainly have) inorder to make an informed decision about the debate. Dawkins, however, pollutes the book with some condescending and arrogant slander about those who comprehend that there may be a God. He lumps \\"creationists\\" and adherents of various religions into piles he labels \\"history-deniers\\" and the \\"44%-ers\\", which he repeatedly and unnecessarily berates throughout his book. Despite being so knowledgeable about his field of evolutionary biology and topics that support his thesis, he reveals that he is rather ignorant about the finer points of faithful theistic observance. Dawkins is a strict imperialist and skeptic who holds scientific inquiry in extremely high regard, though almost to the point of placing it on the pedestal of infallibility. Obviously, science is simply a tool, though a significant one, and evolves with the times as it is spurred by curiosity, popularity, and even politics. Dawkins gives little credit to the fact that many informed \\"creationists\\" do not interpret the biblical account as occurring merely 6,000 years ago, nor that the Earth was formed in six literal 24-hour days, nor that God \\"interfered\\" in the process He set in motion. IF there is a God and He is the author of both the universe and the Bible, then the two would consequently be in agreement (food for thought). Unfortunately, evolution is mistakenly embraced by some athiests, like Dr Dawkins, as proof that a God does not exist, it is not. And, some \\"young-earth creationists\\" believe that the realization of evolution would mean to deny God, it does not. If the evolutionary theory is ultimately revealed to be entirely accurate, great; if not, fine. This text is an oasis of information concerning the evolutionary process and evidence to its merit, however, clouded with irrelevant anti-theism propaganda. Ironically, Dr Dawkins' beautifully detailed book demonstrates that God's creation truly is \\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\".
B00006HAZG|5.0|I wondered how they could cover the story in this limited amount of time, but they did well. The actors were excellent and believable. I loved the beautiful outdoor settings, including the city streets. I judge quite a bit by what they do with Dora, Agnes, and Uriah Heep. They did well. I don't think Charles Dickens readers will be too disappointed. I loved it!
B00192KCQ0|4.0|Metallica has a formula.  One that is tried and tested which made them famous.  It goes a little something like this:    Track 1: Loud and Fast Thrash Metal  Track 2: Dynamic, musically interesting, Prog Metal  Track 3: Ugly, Plodding, Doom Metal with Cool Riff.  Track 4: Angst-filled Power ballad or Alt-Metal  Tracks 5 and above: repeat the previous list in an alternate order.    Don't believe me?  Listen to \\"Ride the Lightning\\", \\"Master of Puppets\\", and \\"Reload\\" again.  This was how I knew that \\"The Day that Never Comes\\" was track 4 after hearing the single.    With few exceptions, this is the formula which made Metallica great, and after the trainwreck that was Saint Anger, it is good to see them back on form.  Musically, the album reminds me of \\"...And Justice for All\\" and it seems to borrow some of the riffs and musical structures which were used on that album.  The mix is a bit annoying since it was recorded too loud, but all in all, Metallica is back.  Some bands get better by experimenting with their sound.  Metallica needs to stick with what they know!
B002GZQYMK|5.0|I liked a lot of Muse's songs and decided to pick this up.  I was blown away.  One of the few albums in which I like every single song.  The songs are unique in that they don't sound like every other band.  If you like any of their music you'll love this album.
0307269191|4.0|This book was really similar to having a conversation with the author over the course of a couple of long distance runs. The insights about his training, suffering, and victories throughout the running seasons were fun and reflected ways that I've felt through my running adventures. I liked the mostly positive thoughts and the unique insights about running in different cultures and geographies.     I would recommend this book to runners who are looking for a good literary work that is easy to read and a joy to explore.
B002SB8R2W|3.0|Alice Sebold should not narrate her books. Her monotone and unemotional reading of her book was upsetting and lackluster. I found myself rewinding often because I would get lost or distracted during her boring read. The plot/story was great nonetheless.
B00127RAJY|4.0|A friend recommended this DVD and said it would kick my butt.  The exercises are simple and part of me was thinking \\"I could do this on my own without the DVD.\\" But it does help to have someone to lead and time the exercises, plus Jillian Michaels has a knack for those inspirational words right when you're about to start taking it easy.  It's divided into 3 levels and says to start with level 1.  I just tried it last night and my initial thoughts are:  1) goes by quick.  It's a 20 minute workout so you really can squeeze it in anytime.  2) Jillian is encouraging!  3) It can be tailored to different intensities.  I work out regularly and thought maybe the Level 1 would be too easy.  But by using heavier weights, going deeper into lunges, jumping higher, etc, I did get something out of it.  and last, 4) Still felt energetic afterword.  Although Jillian says this is all you'll need to do each day to change your body, I'm doubtful. If you're already fairly in shape, the 20 minutes just doesn't feel like enough.    Excited to see what the next 29 days will bring!

B001C4AFOY|3.0|Emily Blunt currently is my absolutely favorite actress.  I would not miss any movie in which she appears.  I particularly liked her in \\"Dan In Real Life,\\" however, she's always a joy to watch.  She has a witty and erotic  persona that makes her brainy and seductive.  As lovely as she was in \\"Young Victoria,\\" she really didn't get  a chance to work to her full potential.  I found the film beautiful to look at but for the most part rather  dull. Also: Sarah Ferguson talks about the fact that the love affair between the youthful Victoria and her consort, Albert, is  relatively unknown, but I've known about their mutual admiration since I was a child. There was a bust of Queen Victoria on our grandmother's mantel piece because she was an avid fan of the beloved monarch.  She told us many times the story of the romantic and working partnership of V & A.  Anyway, this film is a pretty attempt, but as a truly in-depth drama - a lesser work.
B0035W8QUQ|5.0|That's an open, and I hope non-judgmental, question. \\"Via Crucis\\" embodies both a radically creative direction in the performance of 17th C music and an apparently sincere 'spirituality' expressing itself in the concept of a penitential procession in music and words. I make no bones about my indifference to spirituality, so any praise I offer this performance has to do with its musicality.<br /><br />Harpist Christina Pluhar and her ensemble L'Arpeggiata have stretched the limits of \\"historically informed performance\\" well beyond any notion of time-machine replication of the sounds people heard in the 1600s. For me, this was and is an inevitable evolution; the purpose of the \\"early music\\" movement was never museum-like costume music but rather the development of a NEW playing tradition based on both scholarly and intuitive understanding of OLD music, using old notation and other archival sources, surviving traces of old practice in traditional musics, and of course reproduction of the old instruments along with rediscovery of their virtues. L'Arpeggiata has arrived on the scene at a moment when the skills of the singers and instrumentalists committed to that NEW/Old playing tradition are ripe. It's those skills that make Pluhar's amalgamations and experimentations plausible. But there was precedent for her notions decades ago. Cornettist Doron Sherwin could testify to that; in the late 70s, he was doing some of the same jazzy licks in the California-based ensemble \\"Pastime with Good Company.\\"<br /><br />Sherwin's role in L'Arpeggiata is indispensable. His improvisations are the 'fire' that ignites many of the tracks on Via Crucis, as well as on Pluhar's earlier CD of Monteverdi, titled Teatro d'Amore. Without Sherwin, a lot of what L'Arpeggiata does would sound heavy-handed.<br /><br />Via Crucis is an amalgamation of written 16th and 17th C compositions by Biber, Rossi, Merula, Sances, and Monteverdi with 'traditional' religious-festive music of Corsica. The performers are amalgamated also: from the HIP world, male soprano Philippe jaroussky and female soprano Nuria Real; from the Trad world, the Corsican male quartet 'Barbara Furtuna', both camps supported by the instruments of L'Arpeggiata: harps, lutes, guitars, psalterion, hammered dulcimer, violins,gambas, cello, contrabasses, organ, harpsichord, and percussion!<br /><br />The \\"concept\\" is a Procession, a theatrical representation of the \\"Way of the Cross\\". Appropriately, almost all of the music is processional in structure, employing the hypnotic step-rhythms of the passacaglia (pass the street!), ciaccona, and other \\"figured bass\\" repetitions that were immensely popular in the 17th C and that have survived in \\"pop\\" music around the European-colonized world.<br /><br />On the whole, I find this performance just a little less to my personal taste than Pluhar's Teatro d'Amore CD, but still it's extremely fresh and exciting. I don't want to rubber-stamp every bold trick in Pluhar's bag; the rendition of Merula's 'Hor ch'e tempo di dormire' (track 4) gets altogether too space-age reverberant and quasi-reverent for me. But such energy and imagination must be cultivated if the 'early music' movement has any intentions of surviving and expanding its audience.o: from the HIP world, male soprano Philippe jaroussky and female soprano Nuria Real; from the Trad world, the Corsican male quartet 'Barbara Furtuna', both camps supported by the instruments of L'Arpeggiata: harps, lutes, guitars, psalterion, hammered dulcimer, violins,gambas, cello, contrabasses, organ, harpsichord, and percussion!

B002T9H2L0|5.0|\\"Inglourious Basterds\\" is Quentin Tarantino's ironic and fanciful retelling of an episode from World War II. He directed and wrote the film. He's a very imaginative moviemaker who is a fanatical movie buff, very interested in the writing and the dialogue, and he has some American Indian ancestry which will explain a number of features of this film. Sit back and savor the story and the way it is told. It is at times leisurely paced because he wants moviegoers to relish the dialogue. It's a moviegoer's delight with a lot of inside movie stuff going on.<br /> It's a rousing action-adventure yarn, melodramatic, and in the best movie tradition. There's some hammy, over-the-top acting, a lot of violence, and a very cleverly devised screenplay. You'll see flashbacks that help to elucidate the story or characters, and the names of some characters will be telegraphed with written headlines. French and German dialogue is accompanied by subtitles; all of these are trappings which help to validate the narrative. The movie starts with a soundtrack from a Western that may get you in the mood for this serious fantasy.<br /> The scene is set mainly in occupied France in World War II, and you'll see Hitler, Goebells, and the rest of the top Nazi crew.<br /> Central to the the movie's storyline is Colonel Hans Landa, \\"the Jew Hunter\\" of the Nazi SS, played by Christopher Waltz who won an Oscar as best supporting actor. At the beginning of the story he is tracking down a Jewish woman, Shosanna, who is hiding out on a French dairy farm. She escapes and later takes over her aunt's art cinema in Paris. A German soldier, Fredrick Zoller, a hero sniper who has killed 350 of Germany's enemies, falls for her. Goebbels has made a propaganda film, \\"The Nation's Pride\\", retelling the soldier's exploits, and it's going to be shown in Shosanna's theater at the urging of Fredrick. All the German bigwigs will be at the premiere.<br /> Brad Pitt plays Lieutenant Aldo Raine (remember gravelly-voiced Aldo Ray, a movie star a few generations back) who is leading a squad of eight Jewish-American soldiers. They have been parachuted behind enemy lines, and are terrorizing, mutilating and scalping German troops, Apache style.<br /> An Italian movie with the same title was made in 1978. Are we really to take seriously a film in which the German actress and double agent is named Bridget von Hammersmark?<br /> Pitt and his gang are planning to blow up the cinema, but Shosanna is planning her own vengeance. The long scene in the tavern with the British implant and Bridget is suspenseful because we get the feeling that the Brit's German is going to give him away to the SS officer. The scene in which Landa matches a shoe to Bridget's foot is reminiscent of \\"Cinderella\\", but so devastatingly different in outcome.<br /> Sit back and let this movie captivate you and don't worry about historical accuracy.

B0030BYWKK|5.0|At first this album came across as mellower and less dynamic than Van Occupanther.  After a few listens I'm finding it is practically the only thing I want to hear.  Consistent and varied, it is a complete work.  The textures and details are wonderful.  As any great album should be, it is distinctly unique.  I hear influences of folksy Zeppelin, Simon and Garfunkel, America, Fleetwood Mac, Mogwai, and the National (to name a few), but in the end the music is wholly Midlake and none other.  It's a nice change from the previous releases.    Actually, Traffic's Hidden Treasure and Many a Mile to Freedom are the closest tracks I know of.

B0036EH40Q|4.0|Tombstone has had a long and sorry past when it has come to its releases on video.  For we enthusiasts that go back that far this film, despite being released in 1993, saw a laserdisc release but not in AC-3, a definite disappointment as you had a decent picture but dated sound.  As if that wasn't enough, when it was finally released on [[ASIN:6304711905 DVD]] in December 1997 it was still Dolby Pro Logic and while the transfer was widescreen it was a terrible transfer and was not anamorphic.  Those anxious to watch the four black coats come down the road in true widescreen and orchestrated bombast wept like Tom Mix at Wyatt Earp's funeral.<br /><br />And so, the erstwhile lovers of home theater and this film in particular, which should be reference material right next to Saving Private Ryan, Jurassic Park and other 90s pheoms, waited and waited, and waited some more.  Finally our prayers were answered in 2002 with the [[ASIN:B00005RHGL Tombstone - The Director's Cut (Vista Series)]], a very nice transfer, a DTS 5.1 mix, a lot of nice goodies and all was well with the world.<br /><br />Then came Blu-ray and despite being one of the main purveyors of the format, Hollywood/Disney sat on Tombstone again.  It sat patiently in the corner, during the great HD-DVD war it could have been right there saying \\"I'm your huckleberry, that's just my game.\\"  But no, it was left.  So, it was with great trepidation and expectation I approached this release knowing there was no way it could live down its 1997 release but the Vista release left a lot to live up to.  It should come as no surprise it falls in between.<br /><br />THE GOOD<br /><br />This is the best video transfer yet of this film.  It's a gorgeous 2.35:1 AVC transfer.  It retains the grain of the original but otherwise this print is pristine.  The colors snap and are vibrant, it's devoid of any artifacts and despite closing in on 20 years this film holds up well and is visually spectacular.  You won't be disappointed.  As the Vista Series transfer was done in 2002 I believe this is an entirely new transfer as I doubt that one was HD. Also the Vista Series features a \\"Director's Cut\\" of the film that is of dubious merit. This Blu-ray features the original theatrical release of the film.<br /><br />The DTS-MA soundtrack sounds great, not jaw dropping but great.  You have some nice deep bass rumble from the horses, the shots go flying over your head, etc.  I would guess that this is either a straight up sampling of the DTS mix done for the Vista Series or possibly a slight rework from that master material.  I don't believe this is a complete remastering in DTS-MA  It sounds good though and you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />THE BAD<br /><br />It's not bad per se but you get less extras than the Vista Series.  Why they put some additional material together for a prior release and then leave it off the Blu-ray?  One reason usually: to sell the \\"deluxe edition\\" Blu-ray at a later date.  I wasn't expecting the little map and the fancy case like the Vista Series but at least  give me what I had before.  Also there is nothing new here at all.  Kurt Russell has made reference to essentially directing this film, George Cosmatos has passed away now, I would have been interested in a Kurt Russell commentary track or some information on the production.  This film has a very interesting production history and the extras don't cover it, instead you get the stale \\"making of\\" fluff piece.<br /><br />I won't go into the film, if you don't know this film by now I can't help you.  It's easily one of the best westerns ever made and I'm talking right up there with John Ford and the rest.  This is a superb flim with an all-star cast and not a poor performance to be found.  It's also got more one-liners than you've ever seen in a flim before.<br /><br />Overall this is 4/5 stars, it could have been better but I appreciate the effort for the main feature.<br />(Updated 3/10/2012)As the Vista Series transfer was done in 2002 I believe this is an entirely new transfer as I doubt that one was HD. Also the Vista Series features a \\"Director's Cut\\" of the film that is of dubious merit. This Blu-ray features the original theatrical release of the film.<br /><br />The DTS-MA soundtrack sounds great, not jaw dropping but great.  You have some nice deep bass rumble from the horses, the shots go flying over your head, etc.  I would guess that this is either a straight up sampling of the DTS mix done for the Vista Series or possibly a slight rework from that master material.  I don't believe this is a complete remastering in DTS-MA  It sounds good though and you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />THE BAD<br /><br />It's not bad per se but you get less extras than the Vista Series.  Why they put some additional material together for a prior release and then leave it off the Blu-ray?  One reason usually: to sell the \\"deluxe edition\\" Blu-ray at a later date.  I wasn't expecting the little map and the fancy case like the Vista Series but at least  give me what I had before.  Also there is nothing new here at all.

B000NA2776|5.0|After listening just one time to this album I can say it is one of the best albums I have ever heard.

Thank you for giving the world these great songs!
B00006BIO0|2.0|Unlike all the other reviewers I have actually made real time A-B sound comparisons between five different sets of Charlie Patton CDs.... and yes, I actually do own the Revenant set.  Below are the results from my review of Yazoo, Revenant, Document, Catfish and JSP.  I was primarily interested in a realistic soundstage and natural realistic vocals and guitar.  I compared several tracks from each of these sets to each other by hooking up two CD players and switching back and forth in real time as the CDs were playing the same track from two different labels.  After about seven or eight tracks a definite and consistent pattern emerged....<br /><br />Below are my comments on the various Charlie Patton CD sets.  Again, my primary concern is for natural sound quality - noise reduction was secondary to that goal:<br /><br />The two latest Yazoo CDs are the best of the lot - I am speaking of the Yazoos that came out most recently - \\"Best of Charlie Patton\\" and \\"Primeval Blues, Rags, and Gospel Songs\\".  I am NOT referring to the earlier Yazoo CDs that were replaced by these latest remasters, nor am I referring to any of the really old Yazoo LP issues.  These newest Yazoo CDs retain the natural sound of Charlie's vocals and guitar far better than any other collection that I have reviewed here.  Yes, some noise and hiss is still there, but it's a more than reasonable trade off - you get some noise, but you also get ALL the music - Charlie is in the room with you.  In any direct A-B comparison the latest Yazoos are tough to beat - yes, they really are that good.  This is really all you need to know... you can stop reading now.<br /><br />The expensive Revenant box set - on Revenant the vocals have a slightly sharper edge to them which will often be perceived as \\"harsher\\" versus the Yazoo - but, this could come down to personal preference - I just happen to like the vocal EQ on Yazoo a lot better.  The Revenant set also has the most noise and hiss out of all the sets I am reviewing here - even so, if you did not have the newer Yazoos to compare to, this Revenant set would sound pretty darned good in terms of natural sounding vocals, guitar and soundstage.  You get all the music here, but a lot of noise as well.<br /><br />The older Document CD set - surprisingly, they did a pretty good job on this way back when (early 90's?).  The vocals and guitar on Document retain a very natural sound and for some tracks might be preferred to the Revenant set.  This is because the Document vocals sound mellow without the slightly strident sound of sharper vocals that is often a characteristic found on the Revenant set.  Document rolled off the highs slightly resulting in far less high end hiss than is found on either Revenant or Yazoo.  You still get all the music on Document, but with slightly duller vocals - not quite as sharp sounding as Revenant or Yazoo, but some might say it's also easier on the ears.  I should warn you that the Document set does retain a lot more of the mid-range centered crackle and pop that the other labels have managed to tone down.  The bottom line is that the newer Yazoos flat out just sound better than the Document set, but Document does benefit from somewhat lower high-end noise and hiss than Yazoo.<br /><br />Catfish and JSP - if you just want lower \\"noise\\" regardless of the consequences, then these might possibly appeal to you, but you should be aware that you are giving up a lot for a little noise reduction. The main problem is that both Catfish and JSP came out before the newer Yazoos were issued.  At the time, the noise reduction offered by Catfish and JSP seemed like a reasonable trade-off; Catfish and JSP were ok in their time, but now are hopelessly outclassed by the latest Yazoo CDs.  In any case, for Catfish and JSP as more noise reduction and compression is applied the more the \\"air\\" around the soundstage fades away, the vocals become slightly harsher and harder sounding, and the guitar can lose room resonanceand begin to sound like a dull piano - quite simply, when overdone, all of the life is drained out of the recording - yuk!  Why do you think Yazoo never tries to get rid of ALL the noise?  Yazoo just does a superior job in pulling out natural sound with, not the most, but the most reasonable application of noise reduction.<br /><br />Catfish often sounds extremely boxy and constricted in comparison to Yazoo, Revenant or even Document; but I will grant that Catfish does have the least amount of hiss and surface noise out of all the sets reviewed here.  Catfish in particular will come in handy on the extremely noisy tracks that Yazoo did not issue - eleven in all.  For those eleven, bottom of the barrel, tracks - and they really do sound like sandpaper! - just about ANY noise reduction is going to be preferred to none at all.<br /><br />And for JSP, it's obvious they started with the Revenant set as their source material and then selectively applied noise reduction (or not) to various tracks.... so, essentially what you are getting with JSP is the Revenant set with more noise reduction.  Revenant certainly has the most noise and hiss of all the sets here, so it's not an unreasonable approach for JSP to tackle that.  Occasionally the JSP track seems indistinguishable from the same Revenant cut, but most of the time JSP has layered on additional noise reduction - it just depends on which track you listen to.  For example, compare \\"Dry Well Blues\\" or \\"Moon Going Down\\" on JSP versus Revenant and you will note just a very slight reduction in noise, but also correspondingly slightly less \\"air\\" around the music on JSP - those tracks sound ever so slightly fuller to me on Revenant and the addition noise reduction offered by JSP hardly seems worth it.  So, could the less expensive JSP set could be viewed a sort of poor man's bargain versus the expensive Revenant set? - it really depends on your perspective.  My personal take on this is that you are better off with the Revenant set and then YOU DECIDE how much you want to turn down the treble, if at all! - that is really all JSP has really done anyway.  With JSP you do get all the additional non-Patton tracks that Revenant originally issued.  Both Revenant and JSP give you a lot more songs than any of the other sets reviewed here.<br /><br />In conclusion, my advice is to get the latest Yazoo CDs as those are simply head and shoulders above all the rest of these Patton sets - however, just remember that if you only had one of any of these various box sets and could not make comparisons to any of the others your ears would quickly adapt and you would likely be happy with what you had.<br /><br />So, there you have it.and begin to sound like a dull piano - quite simply, when overdone, all of the life is drained out of the recording - yuk!

B0015DROBO|4.0|good read. I was not expecting to enjoy this book as much as I did. It was a quick read with a fast moving plot. It made me reflect about women's rights, financial criminals, and how modern society judges crimes in different spaces.
B0019N8P2W|3.0|Did they really need to use packaging almost identical as the bootleg copies out there? Also, with no chapter page or booklet with this set, and just a little \\"note\\" about the music,  I am pretty disappointed. My Dr. Katz complete set came with a nice booklet about the characters and episodes. I guess I expected the Daria set to be just as carefully put together.     Im still glad to own a legit copy of the episodes, as they're smart and funny and just as entertaining now as before. I guess Ill just hope for a re-release set later or something :)
B002ZG98VE|5.0|As a scholar of the Middle Ages I can say you're not likely to see a better re-creation of the era of King John than any random frame you might pick from Ridley Scott's Robin Hood. From Celtic monuments to Roman ruins, to Loxley hall abundant with 12th century furnishings this film is breathtaking and superbly researched. Except perhaps for the huts clustered around London Tower-- the castle was in the midst of a city long before AD 1199. But real huts may be preferable to digital animation.   The authors know English history and the Robin Hood material and play fast and loose with both -- which is being true to the tradition of Mallory,Shakespeare, and the Victorian versions of the tale that nowadays seem to be taken for Robin Hood gospel.In a merry spirit of throwing a bit of everything into this script, we are being treated to  glimpses of the masked Dying God in the forest (see archeologist Margaret Murray's The God of the Witches for what that's all about.) The Magna Carta -- complete with authentic signatures of the 1215 version and Matthew Paris's illustrations of shields from forty years later -- makes a premature appearance twice. And the royal favorite turns out to be an agent working for the unpopularity of the king to make way for an invasion from France -- a plot twist borrowed from the time of Richard III (don't trust Shakespeare for this, see Paul Murray Kendall's definitive Richard III.) But, hey, Walter Scott combines three centuries in the opening paragraphs of Ivanhoe, why can't Ridley Scott? I give this film five stars, it is stunningly produced, persuasively acted, and keeps up the long tradition of anchronism in Robin Hood plots.
B00004SZWB|4.0|Though the production may not hold as much integrity as his best albums, this is so often eighties near-perfect pop that, in its own context, stands as tall as any other splendidly solid release.
B003ELOQCA|5.0|I've been a U2 fan for decades, and this was by far the best U2 Concert I've seen.  Great mix of old and new songs.  I saw the live feed on Youtube, and can't wait to see this on Blu ray after they have touched up the sounds and video.
B002ZRPQ5K|1.0|Yeah yeah yeah. Bands need to evolve and experiment and move on. I've heard those tired phrases bandied about before. In this case, this clearly hasn't worked for Keane. That said, it's all been downhill since Keane's SOARING and SYRUPY SWEET gorgeous debut, 'Hopes And Fears'. Why do so many seemingly great bands resort to releasing rap tinged music when they run out of ideas?! Don't get me wrong. I love 'old school' hip-hop, rap, etc., but having Keane meld some of the inferior modern era rap junk into their music is downright painful to listen to! At this point, I would either call it quits if I was them, or revert back to the original 'Hopes And Fears' formula that works and garnered them respect and a wide audience to begin with. That stuff was quality and moving!
B00009R6J7|5.0|It is a very helpful tool, fits very nicely on both my Hasselblad H3DII and Kodak 14N (Nikon body) digital cameras. I have a Hasselblad quick release plate with two bubble levels on my tripod but they are small and hard to see especially when the tripod legs are fully extended.     I highly recommend this handy little tool!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If I were about to pan a series here and give it one star as a few have done (in contrast to overwhelming evidence to the contrary), I might want to humbly re-examine my view.    Although Firefly didn't even run a complete season, it generated a fan base like no other TV series. (500,000 boxed sets from Amazon, 10 books, and a fan base that kept growing for more than two years after the series was abruptly canceled by FOX).      Low ratings?  Yes, but clearly a great case can be made that FOX intentionally sabotaged the series (a long story).     The people here are pretty sophisticated in general.  But I wonder about some of the people that panned the series, especially when at the same time they lauded a TV series featuring puppets and apparently targeting kids. I also wonder if many of the people that panned Firefly didn't have hidden puritanical motivations that they didn't want to admit.     No, Firefly is not _War and Peace_, it wasn't meant to be.  It is simply light, engaging entertainment that was very well done.  For that I give it 5 stars.
0887307280|5.0|Absolute must read for the small to mid-sized business owner or manager.  Gerber looks at the root cause of business failure - the owner's desire to work IN the business rather than ON it - and provides a common sense approach to looking at the business in a different way - that of a replicatable series of systems rather than an extension of the owner.<br /><br />Critical to Gerber's thinking is that each business can be run similar to a franchise model - where the customer experience is consistent, the talent and skill required to run the business is minimized, and the approach is well documented and easily learned. The role of the owner is to view their business as a potential franchise, begin with the end in mind, and start building a business system that will deliver consistently for all stakeholders.<br /><br />There is a reason this book has been on the must read list for 30 years - and it is still fresh and relevant today.
B0015DROBO|3.0|I found it painfully boring the first hundred pages or so until the part where Armansky introduces his fascination with Lisbeth Salander.  But then it got boring again until Blomkvist settles in with the Vanger family.  I kept plodding on only because I paid for it on my kindle.  Too many characters to keep track of, too much history, background and build up.  The Salander character was the only saving grace - it was only when she came into the picture that I got into it.  I liked her character and rooted for her.  The story itself is pretty fascinating with some unexpected twists and turns.  However I kept wishing this book would be over already so I can read a better mystery.  When I finally finished it, I didn't look back as I do with good books and re-read certain sections.  I just simply moved on to the next story.

0123694965|5.0|I wish I could have given the book a one star rating. Then everybody would read this review. Anyway, you are reading it now, I guess because the book only got excellent ratings. And this is for a reason: this book is my favorite lecture when I'm sitting on the toilet. Don't get me wrong, this is nothing disrespectful; it is the number one award a book can get from me, because it is the only time of the day I'm not disturbed by someone. No phone, no email, no twitter. I share this time with the greatest writers of all times: Thomas Mann, J.R.R. Tolkien, Charles Dickens, Herman Melville, George R. R. Martin and Bill Watterson.    Next to consulting video game developers and publishers in Germany, I'm teaching Game Design at the Games Academy and University of Applied Sciences in Berlin. This is why I have read the most books about Game Design on the market. Jesse Shell doesn't repeat well known facts and strategies, he gets down to the core of the topics and explains the source. This might be a little academic, if he would not choose great examples to illustrate his thoughts. In the end it will help you understand your craft much better and remember important aspects.    The book of lenses has a wide scope, which will make it suitable for teachers setting up a curriculum, students or beginners entering the industry or game design veterans making sure their latest invention is not missing a crucial point, which could turn a million dollar idea to a spot of bat barf.
B000VMFDW2|4.0|Not for the faint of heart or stomach, this read is a must for WWII enthusiasts.  Atrocoties and kindnesses abound as you follow Sledgehammer through the perils of a mortarman trying to do his best amid deplorable conditions that test his mettle and resolve.  Written in plain, everyday language, Sledge describes every facet of war....the good, bad and ugly....and very ugly.  The time I spent in Viet Nam during 1968 was a walk in the park in comparison.
B002JVWRAY|5.0|I was hesitant to say the least when I started watching this season. I did not believe the writers could possibly continue to create as well as they had in season 4.  I am proud to say that I was mistaken.  Not only did the writing make me wish the next episode was right at my fingertips, but the way they crafted the story to touch previous episodes from every seasons was impressive. I found myself re-tracing the steps of various characters in seasons 1-4 to find out their real intentions.  I do not know if I would recommend this for anyone who hasn't seen the first 4 seasons.  The writing is great and interesting, but if you have seen the entire story-arch, you will understand character's motives and the intentions of the writers much more. I must also add a note about the final episode, Swan Song.  The creator Eric Kripke wrote this as his last episode (he will not be the person in charge of the series next year).  From watching it, I can tell he intended this to be his masterpiece, and he did not disappoint. Kudos to Kripke and good luck to Ms. Gamble who is taking over next year!
B000059XUO|5.0|This is my third copy of this movie. I purchaced it on VHS originally, then on DVD. My roommate let her brother \\"borrow\\" it and I never saw it again! Can't stand NOT having this movie. I don't watch it all that often but I rank it in my top ten favorites so I have to have it.
0140432051|5.0|The shockwaves from the publication of this book still resound today.  The full title of the book is \\"On the Origin of Species By Means Of Natural Selection or Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life\\" by Charles Darwin and it was first published on November 24th of 1859.  The importance of the work was not in the originality of the idea; the idea of evolution had been a theory long before as Darwin discusses in the text, nor was Darwin the only scientist at the time to arrive at the theory, as a paper by Alfred Wallace arrived the same year as Darwin's.  What made \\"The Origin of Species\\" so significant was the way Darwin discusses the theory, and that it was not written just for scientists, but for everyone.  This makes it a work of Literature as well as one of Science.    Another key aspect to \\"The Origin of Species\\" is that it has completely changed the focus of the subject from the point of its publication until now and undoubtedly will do so for some time to come.  It is still the dominate point of reference in the argument between those who oppose the theory and those who support it.  Those on both sides of the argument (and I use the term argument because the term discussion would lead one to believe that the discourse is much more civil than it actually is) would do well to emulate Darwin in the way he discusses his theory.    \\"The Origin of Species\\" in many ways sets the standard for scientific argument.  Though again Darwin did not create the standard with this book, the significance of the work and the readability of the book make it stand out as an example of the correct way to present and defend a theory.  Of course Darwin presents facts which support his theory, but it is his discussion of problems with the theory which is the strength of the book and his theory.  Darwin admits he doesn't have answers to all of the issue, and he offers ways to prove his theory wrong or at least force a significant adjustment to the theory.    It is interesting that the issues with Darwin's theory and the methods of proving it wrong are in many ways unchanged.  There will always be gaps in the fossil record, and there will probably always be questions of reducibility, but that doesn't mean that there isn't more evidence to support the theory than there ever has been, there is a lot more which has strengthened the theory, and the key point is that there hasn't been any evidence found to disprove the theory.  And with regards to species being fixed, the scientific argument has long been over, though one can still find non-scientists who would argue the point.    \\"The Origin of Species\\" remains an important work of science and literature today.  Understanding Darwin's theory is necessary to understanding the political discussions and ramifications that continue to take place.  It also serves as a great guide to understanding what a scientific discussion is and how it works, and by contrast how it differs from a political, social, or theological discussion.  It should go without saying that \\"The Origin of Species\\" gets five stars, and the introduction by John Burrow enhances the experience by putting it in the context of Darwin's life, and the times in which it was written and published.  I was a little surprised that the Penguin Classics edition didn't include any notes on Darwin's text, but it does include a bibliography of Darwin's works.  Also, while the text included is from the first edition of the book, it does include \\"An Historical Sketch\\" and a Glossary which were in later editions.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|Kung Fu Panda is a very fun animated movie that I enjoy and my kids love. Po (nicely voiced by Jack Black) is an affable but somewhat overweight Panda that dreams of becoming a Kung Fu Master. Sadly, his lot in life seems to be making and selling noodles for his father (he was adopted) and all of the Kung Fu glory reserved for the \\"Furious Five\\" (who even have a line of action figures). All of that changes when chance lands him in the roll of the \\"Dragon Warrior\\" and his Kung Fu training begins in earnest... just in time to face the powerful escaped villainous snow leopard, Tai Lung (Ian McShane).<br /><br />Like most martial arts movies, there is significant violence but it is mostly of the slapstick cartoon variety. There is a very positive message for kids that comes through loud and clear, don't judge people based on looks and preconceptions.<br /><br />The animation is good and the voice acting is enjoyable with Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogan, David Cross, Lucy Liu and.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
1433502410|5.0|The ESV Study Bible (2008) may be the best of its kind. The English Standard Version text, which is \\"essentially literal,\\" is a major reason. The ESV \\"seeks as much as possible to capture the precise wording of the original text and the personal style of each Bible writer.\\" It is not an exact word for word translation as you would have in an interlinear Bible, but it's not far from it.<br /><br />The ESV Bible made its appearance in 2001 with praise from a broad spectrum of evangelicals including Joni Eareckson Tada, Max Lucado, Dr. R. C. Sproul and Dr. Joseph M. Stowell. The text is a revision of the Revised Standard Version and is slightly more literal.<br /><br />From my days working at a Bible bookstore, I remember a nifty handout prepared by Zondervan that showed where the different translations fell on a scale depicting their literalness. On the left side of the spectrum, you had the most literal versions and on the opposite, those that were the least. Everything fell in between the two outermost points, which in this case were the interlinear Bible and The Message.<br /><br />The New American Standard Bible was in second position, followed by The Amplified Bible, and in fourth position, the ESV. The Revised Standard Version and the King James Version were next in line. For comparison, I found online an individual who had done a scholarly ranking, admittedly subjective, but nevertheless interesting. He ranked the ESV and the New American Standard as the two best for study.  He had the King James Version and the New American Standard at 2½ on a scale of 1 to 10 with one being the most literal. The ESV was a 3 and the New International Version was further back at 4½.<br /><br />The ESV Study Bible boasts that it is the most comprehensive study Bible ever published, and judging from all the additional material outside the Bible text, this may not be an exaggeration. All the notes, maps, illustrations, articles and other features are \\"new,\\" which probably means that they were either created for this Bible or have never been published before in this form in a study Bible. Those who purchase the print edition also get access to the ESV Online Study Bible.<br /><br />The format is comparable to the New International Version Study Bible with notes filling the lower quarter or half of the page. The notes cover many but not all of the verses. These are preceded by highlighted boxes that summarize the thought of a section of Scripture. The notes on the individual verses fill in the detail.<br /><br />The helpfulness and quality of the notes is impressive. Equally magnificent is a section of articles in the back breaking down major Bible themes like salvation, doctrine, ethics, interpretation, reading, the canon of scripture, the reliability of manuscripts, archaeology, original languages, and how the New Testament interprets and quotes the Old Testament. You also get a section that deals not only with the Bible's relationship within Christianity, but how its teachings compare with those of world religions and cults. A concordance and color maps are in the back. Many smaller, colored maps are embedded in the notes. One thing this does not have is the words of Christ in red, which I know from experience is important to some people.<br /><br />This was created by a team of 95 evangelical Christian scholars and teachers from various backgrounds. Their names, the institutions that they represent, and their educational attainments are listed in the front of the Bible.<br /><br />Unless you prefer a study Bible with a special emphasis, as in the New Spirit-Filled Bible, which is geared toward Charismatics, or one that is more hands-on, as in the New Inductive Study Bible, which requires a great deal of discipline and marking, this is an excellent choice for use by a broad spectrum of Christians. It gives you a translation that is accurate, appealing from a literary standpoint, and places before you a large amount of scholarly but accessible reference material.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Wall-E is one of my favorite animated movies and an easy choice for the kids. The little robot Wall-E, is left with the monumental task of cleaning up all of the trash on the entire Earth after all of the human population evacuated on an extended cruise while waiting for the robot to complete it's assignment. Obviously there is a bit of an environmental comment here, but it really isn't the entire focus of the movie.<br /><br />This movie is actually romantic comedy adventure, with our hero becoming somewhat eccentric after plodding along with his somewhat hopeless task when he suddenly meets EVE (a VERY advanced robot) who seems somewhat out of his league. The rest of the story revolves around his attempts to find, save, and win the digital heart of his true love.<br /><br />The animation is top notch and the visual extras at the end are enjoyable.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
0452287022|5.0|What can I say? This is an incredible novel. I'm sixteen years old, and did not find the plot too slow moving like others my age might have. From the first page, I was drawn into Griet's world. Chevalier's writing is so intricate and pure, it flows like poetry. I was entranced by the novel throughout the entire journey of Griet's shining moments to her downfall. The novel feels like you're immersed in one of Vermeer's paintings; it feels so real. I loved how Chevalier mixed the artwork and passion felt between Griet and Vermeer, creating a beautiful thread that wound throughout the entire story. The history is really well researched, especially the Protestant/Catholic differences, and Griet's belief in purity and innocence. I also enjoyed how Griet always referred to Vermeer as \\"he\\", she never once called him by his name. It's a clever way to show the feelings that she has for him, he being the only man she wants, and it maintains the air of mystery surrounding Vermeer's life. A book that I know I will read many times, highly recommended.
B0013FDM7E|4.0|\\"I Am Legend\\" is a very enjoyable post apocalyptic \\"zombie\\" movie that only bears a mild resemblance to the Matheson original story, [[ASIN:0765318741 I Am Legend]]. Will Smith puts in a good performance in the lead as Dr. Robert Neville, who is perhaps the last \\"normal\\" human on earth after a highly contagious virus sweeps the US and possibly the world. Being the last man on earth and perhaps the only person who could find a cure for the many infected humans (aka fast zombies) is a huge burden for the good doctor, who has settled into a bit of routine of trying to gather supplies, capture test subjects, and practicing his golf long game.<br /><br />A lot of the story is told through flashback and there are truly some moving scenes that add to the drama and provide insight to the deteriorating mindset of Dr. Neville. The action is fairly evenly paced, with some heart pounding moments scattered throughout. The special effects range from cheesy to very good, but hold up when needed.<br /><br />This movie does a great job of setting the mood of the isolation and fear that Dr. Neville experiences and is a quite watchable horror flick... I just think it could have been named something else and would have been just as good.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
0061438294|5.0|Jeffrey Deever fans will probably have the same reaction I did on seeing this book: he's going to tell us how Kathryn Dance does it.<br /><br />Maybe Dance is really talented, or maybe Deever is exaggerating just a bit. Either way, this is a very interesting book and there's a lot to learn here.<br /><br />I first saw this book in the Chinese translation. The translator did a good job, but why read a translation if you can read the original? But this does bring up a point worth considering: how much of the author's observations are valid in observing people from other cultures? For example, he mentions steepling the hands. This is a very rare behavior among Han Chinese, on any occasion, and I have never observed a Taiwan aborigine doing this at all. There are other sorts of gestures.<br /><br />Of course the book does not need to be exhaustive, or valid for all people at all times. Navarro does make the point that you have to observe baseline behavior and continue from there. But a person's cultural upbringing will make a difference in their displayed (and undisplayed) behavior.<br /><br />Although the topic of the book is nonverbal communication, it is, after all, written in words. I strongly believe that correct usage of words and language facilitates communication. I suppose I would be within my rights to call my computer a trapeze, but that wouldn't help people understand me. If the authors do not know the difference between disinterested and uninterested, the editors should have enlightened them. In the book the authors say that a kowtow means bending the torso. That is a bow, not a kowtow. Kowtow means kow, knock, tow, head: get down on your hands and knees and knock your head on the floor. Simply bending the torso is not a kowtow. Go to a Chinese Buddhist temple and watch: when a Buddhist enters, we kowtow three times, we don't bow.<br /><br />Navarro has extensive experience in observing stress reactions. I should think so! I think simply being interrogated by the FBI would be extremely stressful. If you shut me in a little room with an FBI agent and he started asking me about the disappearance of the Roanoke colony, I would probably be displaying all sorts of stress reactions. But let me assure you, I didn't do it!<br /><br />Overall, the book is well worth reading carefully. Obviously, it's not as easy at Navarro makes it sound. But keep your eyes peeled, and you will see a lot that had escaped your notice before reading this book.ssful.

193413712X|4.0|No, it's not why Tinkers came to win the Pulitzer Prize. It's how blood and neurons and shared electrical charges become consciousness. Paul Harding takes on that question: attempting to depict the sheer visceral qualities of consciousness. Steering clear of description, he re-creates consciousness as a perceptual space, occasionally on a deathbed, more successfully through a rhapsodic engagement with the natural world. Alongside the uncontrollable and mysterious biology of the human mind, Harding describes the controlled mechanical workings of clocks. An epileptic father embodies the mystical dreamer of consciousness; his tinker son gets rich fixing clocks. There is an absolutely essential logic to the interactions of Harding's fathers and sons that creates a deep and inescapable resonance. Extraneous mash-ups and pasteboard female characters aside, Tinkers is steadfast in its proposition that human agency is a tragic enterprise: resplendent in biological consciousness, trapped by social convention, always out of time.

B002JVWR9U|5.0|I read the books a few years back, loving anything vampire related, and didn't like how shallow and \\"spacey\\" they were, and how Elena was a spoiled popular girl who got everything she wanted, and took others down to get her way.     I didn't have high hopes for the series, but checked out the pilot episode and got hooked. The characters all have likable and hateable qualities and a lot more depth is shown than in the book series, though I am frustrated at the cliff hanger end of Season 1 on last night, though you can bet I will be tuning in when the second season comes out in September. It has a hit of drama without getting completely bogged down in high school cliches, which makes it interesting for those a few years out of high school. I can't stand gossip girls or 90210 drama, and think they play the small town aspect well.          Until this series, I have never found a TV series or movie that I liked better than the original books.
B001C4AFOY|2.0|The actress portraying the 18 year old Queen looked as if she were in her 30s, Lord Melbourne (a true gentleman who loved Victoria as a daughter) was depicted as a satyr, I kept waiting for King William to hiss 'My Precious', Albert, an extremely intelligent, studious and dignified individual from his youth came off as weak and subservient, and a ridiculous, untrue liberal socialist agenda was attributed to Queen Victoria's reign. The only positive comment I can offer is for the costumes and sets.  A much better production on Queen Victoria and Prince Albert is 'Victoria & Albert', you just have to ignore that the actor playing Albert has an English accent instead of German.
0785134352|5.0|I went to see this film as soon as it came out to theaters, and loved every minute of it. So much so, in fact, that I was compelled to read the comic. I am NOT a comic reader. Having stated this, I absolutely LOVED this comic. One of my major gripes against comics is that you only get a snippet of the story with each issue, but this graphic novel contains the entire story in one hardcover book. The story is every bit as twisted, funny, and entertaining as the film, and there are enough differences that makes reading this a must for fans of the movie. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up, even you non-comic readers.
B0037W68F4|4.0|But this album is really good.  I got drawn into this album when I heard Flash Delerium.  I actually thought I was watching the Cars, Ben Goldwasser looks so much like Ric Ocasek in the new video.  The video was fantastic, absolutely hillarious and trippy with a good dose of light handed heavy subject matter.  Apparently MGMT is upset that its pop following doesn't get their sensibilities, but for the people who matter, I think they have finally hit the mark.  Brian Eno late 70's psychadelic glam sorta feel, with a little new wave thrown in, but they made this sound their own.  MGMT has always been great at crafting a good hook but I am thrilled that they crossed over from loops into more straight forward rock band material.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|I saw \\"Wicked\\" on Broadway last fall, and liked it a lot.  But then this spring we started listening to the original cast recording in the car, and the show worked it way into my heart and mind to an absurd degree. I wake up in the middle of the night with these songs echoing in my head! Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth do a brilliant job bringing these two really strange, potentially unsympathetic characters to life and making you fall in love with both of them. The music shows me how the story works on many levels: some comic, some deeply emotional, many of them ironic. There is too much to take in on the first listening or two, which is why seeing the play for the first time just washed over me as an amazing spectacle.  Now I've listened to the CD at least 80 times and I truly hear something new every time. I can't think of any other musical that has ever done that.  And, it still moves me to tears.     The stage production IS the show, however, and I would not expect someone to fall in love with \\"Wicked\\" just based on listening to the album alone.  So try to do both, it's definitely worth it!  We saw the touring stage production last week (a rare occurrence for me to see a play twice), and while it could not quite match the magic of seeing it on Broadway, we were treated to a wonderful night out, entertained by a powerful cast who could bring these soaring songs home.
0307716988|5.0|In my opinion to know people the best source are themselves. There are so many things said about Michael, a lot of those invented by people who wanted to make money out of his popularity using his name. I think Michael was very pure, very sensitive and very talented. Like everybody else he made mistakes and his life like each one of us wasn't perfect but he utilized his talent for good, communicating a good message to the world and to kids. In this book you get to know his story from his own words and at the end you admire him even more because he was always awesome as a human being and as an artist giving all that he could to entertain the world and achieve levels never imagined. He is the King of Pop in his own right because he worked for it.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|I had not seen this film at the theatre but bet it would be really something in 3-D. Even in High Definition the detail & colors jump out.

B002RSDW80|5.0|\\"Julie and Julia\\" is a gem of a picture that is beautifully written, shot, and acted. Nora Ephron has woven biography and Julie Powell's vision of Julia Child, along with Julie's own book and blogs of her experience into a inspirational film. Meryl Streep, Amy Adams, Stanley Tucci, Chris Messina, and all the other actors are terrific. The behind-the-scenes' chefs on this film also present amazing-looking food. If you like to eat, if you like to cook, if you like to watch two married couples who support each other and treat each other as equals, then this is a film you will enjoy. And, unlike so many recent DVDs, this one includes a wonderful special feature, \\"Secret Ingredients: Creating Julie and Julia,\\" which is also fantastic.
0385341008|1.0|The book is hard to follow.  Since it is made up of only letters written between different characters, at different times, you must maintain all of the information in each one  in order to follow the plot.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|Cooler master as we all know is at the top of the game when it comes to heat-piping and water-cooled technologies.  This product is no different.  I did not give it a perfect 100% score, because it is a beast and will not fit in every case, or with every MB, but if you have the average mid to full size case with a full size MB that accepts an i7 you will be fine as wine with this heat-pipe-fan combo cpu cooler.  It is near silent because it takes advantage of two huge fans working in tandem to remove heat from the radiator pipes, and with bios fan controls MB can self regulate the speed of the fans to give you a boost of cooling during more intensive workloads and stay whisper quiet other times.  Great product, and its cheap now.  I paid over $80 bucks and have no buyers remorse.

B002ZG997M|2.0|For years, I've been waiting for The Hughes Brothers to make a good film... and they just keep letting me down. MENACE II SOCIETY had moments of flair and style, but ultimately was not a good film. DEAD PRESIDENTS is one of the most needlessly violent films I've ever seen, and while I appreciate the point it's trying to make, it doesn't make it well. FROM HELL... well, being a comic fan and a devotee of Alan Moore, this film was simply god-awful. And then I saw the trailer for THE BOOK OF ELI, and I thought to myself... COOL! Denzel as a post-apocalyptic wasteland Zatoichi-esque wanderer and Gary Oldman as his nemesis. That seems like the recipe for a really kick-butt film. But... no. They manage to take a really interesting premise and make it convoluted, cliched, inanimate and ultimately dull. The problems that the two stars of the film face the most is that they've played these roles before, and they've played them better. Denzel did the FAR superior MAN ON FIRE and Gary did the FAR superior LEON: THE PROFESSIONAL.<br /><br />What also upsets me is the way that not just this film, but every film that the great Ray Stevenson seems to be in, his talent is just wasted.<br /><br />The film operates under a similar pretense to another superior film, Kurt Wimmer's EQUILIBRIUM, that certain abstract things (in this case, certain 'books') cause death, destruction and war. And what has caused more death and destruction throughout history than religion? Again, if you've read anything on the description of this film, you know that the book Denzel is carrying with him is the last-known copy of the King James bible. And apparently, this bible is giving him a supernatural ability to resist harm and kick serious tail. Denzel's dialogue consists mainly of how he's \\"being led by faith\\" or \\"being guided by God\\"... old hat. Gary goes for the quiet insane that has bursts of rage and violence. Old hat. The desolate post-nuclear wastes are shot with highly bleached colors. OLD... HAT. How this film becomes even worse is that Denzel gets a kid sidekick. Well, it's twenty-something hottie Mila Kunis, but she has the emotional range of a twelve-year old, so for all intents and purposes, she's a kid sidekick.<br /><br />And the film, near the end, has an O.Henry-like twist that is so incredibly stupid that I had trouble believing that they included it.<br /><br />Another mess by the formerly-promising Hughes Brothers. They can pretty much count me out. Fool me once, shame on you... fool me FOUR TIMES, to quote Dubya, I won't get fooled again.becomes even worse is that Denzel gets a kid sidekick.

B00337KM2S|2.0|George Clooney once again playing himself in a romantic comedy which is really neither that romantic nor funny. Don't get me wrong, Clooney is always pretty good as himself. The story is very, very slow moving. Editing is terrible- the story gets very choppy and even confusing in places. Interesting premises to work with-business travel, relationships on the road, making a successful career out of firing others - but the supporting cast and editing really get in the way. Watch the deleted scenes-they would have really helped make this a better movie. There were scenes in the movie which didn't truly make sense until I saw the deleted scenes. Not a bad movie, but disappointing because it could have been a really good movie with the right cast and director.

The story deals with a very tumultuous time in history and I think it was very clever of the author to have Death be the narrator. I liked the little asides that Death put in every once in awhile as well.   The main character was really great too. I like that it was a very strong and smart little girl. I think contemporary fiction needs more of those kind of characters.     Overall, I think the story was fresh and inventive. I rented the book from the library and I definitely will be buying it, so I can read it again.

That being said, of course the movie leaves a lot to be desired, if you are a diehard fan of the books.  It's been proven in each film that the books can tolerate editing for film's sake. I have often felt even more drawn into the story after seeing a movie, and enjoy going back to re-read the books in order to recall the delicious bits that have been cut from the film.     I'm happy with the movie.

B000LYXJPS|3.0|Barely a year after the triumph of  [[ASIN:B000MU4F5Y SGT. PEPPER'S]] and their subsequent numerous Top 40 singles, the unparalleled and cohesive unit that was the Beatles lay in total disarray. Cooperation and co-inspiration between band members had given way to backbiting and blatant avoidance. This sad turn of events was unintentionally chronicled in the double-record set known as the WHITE ALBUM.<br /><br />These recordings are not so much the Beatles as they are John and friends, Paul with backup, etc. Quality on the WHITE ALBUM varies widely. The excellence of \\"Mother Nature's Son,\\" \\"I'm So Tired,\\" \\"Long, Long, Long,\\" Blackbird,\\" \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and \\"Yer Blues\\" is offset by throwaway trivialities like \\"Wild Honey Pie,\\" \\"Savoy Truffle,\\" \\"Martha My Dear,\\" \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except Me And My Monkey.\\"<br /><br />John Lennon comes off worst here, for several reasons. Because some were busily parsing his songs for hidden meanings, John responded by creating nonsensical lyrics for many of his WHITE ALBUM contributions. \\"Glass Onion,\\" \\"Happiness Is A Warm Gun,\\" \\"Cry Baby Cry\\" and others are the result of his ill-advised playfulness. The inclusion of Yoko Ono in the chorus of \\"Bungalow Bill\\" was as much in error as was the chorister who kept singing \\"Buffalo\\" instead of \\"Bungalow.\\" \\"Revolution #9,\\" Lennon's Opus Dopus, defies description even as it defines drugged-out excess.<br /><br />Paul McCartney's Dylanesque storytelling (\\"Rocky Raccoon\\") makes his schmaltzy side (\\"Honey Pie\\") that much more of an enigma. George Harrison's few efforts are fairly consistent and clearly demonstrate his too-long overlooked talents. Ringo's \\"Goodnight\\" lullabye lies in stark contrast to the jarring \\"Revolution #9\\" aural nightmare that directly precedes it.<br /><br />And as for dreams, the WHITE ALBUM sessions are an eyes-wide-open indicator that the Beatles dream would soon be over.

The \\"insight edition\\" includes \\"trivia, notes, and inspiration to amplify this beloved classic.\\" I agree wholeheartedly with that assessment and believe you will as well. Some of the English ways and words are very well explained in the insights. This was very helpful to me as I found the original book hard to understand in some places. The insights help make everything clear and easy to understand. Anyone who loves Jane Austen will enjoy reading the added notes in this wonderful edition. Highly recommended!

I agree that the mixes for this and \\"Peace Sells\\" were pretty muddy, but the vocals were far better in the original mixes.  In the remix of \\"Last Rites/Loved to Death\\" it sounds like they left the original vocal track and Mustaine tried to sing over it - the thing is, he's not even in sync with himself.  Truly odd...

B003BOUKRU|5.0|I didn't expect to learn anything about Celine Dion through watching this movie other than she's extremely rich, is nice to people, and has a child with no personality. While all that is true, what can be learned through watching this is just what drives Celine to continue her strenuous career. The most interesting part of the documentary is when Celine begins having vocal problems. She cancels some shows which lets down many of her fans. She recovers but the vocal problems return. Before one concert is about to begin, she tells her crew that she is having a hard time speaking. She is reluctant to go on with the show but does anyway. She manages to make it through but her voice sounds strained as she belts out \\"All By Myself.\\" After the show, someone says to her \\"Well, it's over\\" and Celine replies \\"Yes but at what cost?\\" knowing that straining her voice in this manner could permanently damage her voice. Moments later you find out just why she went on with the show. She's confronted with a fan who says she was in ICU and thinking of Celine helped her want to live. It is moments like this that you see just how connected Celine is with her fans. And looking out in the audience during any of her concerts, you will see just how connected they are to her. Critics can say what they want, but Celine has touched the lives of millions of people around the world and this film shows the obligation she feels towards them to not let them down.<br /><br />At the end of the movie, when the tour is over Celine is asked how long until she is performing again. She says a year and a half. I really wish she would reconsider that. She needs way more rest than that. Her fans are loyal and will wait however many years it takes. But Celine really needs to take an long break from performing these grueling schedules. Barbra Streisand's voice didn't start to fade until she was in her 60's. Celine's voice is already starting to weaken and she's only in her 40's. She really need to take care of it if she wants to have a career as long as Barbra's.<br /><br />Celine really is one of the hardest working women in show business and she is one hell of a performer. Her concerts are high energy and women (and men) love watching her on stage. You would think her concerts would be filled with mostly women but looking at the footage in this documentary shows it's pretty evenly split among genders of who is a fan. And I really doubt all the guys are gay.<br /><br />I also gotta say this documentary looks fantastic on BluRay.she wants to have a career as long as Barbra's.

B002U6CJCO|5.0|UNIVERSAL SOLDIER  REGENERATION    The 5th film in the series and yes that is correct it is the 5th film thus far about every one's favorite non human fighter. And with it being the 5th it is also the 5th film with lead character Luc Deveraux but only the third with Van Damme in the role. Now there has been plenty of mix up since the first film. Parts 2 and 3 were direct to video sequals that followed what happened in the first film. Then came 4 which brought back Van Damme so it ignored the previous two and followed off after the first film. Then comes this one here which I believe ignores the previous 3 and follows on after the first. It would be confusing but I consider all of them apart of the series so what ever, this is the 5th.    Now the big deal with this one was that not only was Van Damme returning but so was Dolph Lundgren, so we can see these two go at it once again. But on top of that MMA stars Mike Pyle and former UFC Heavyweight Champ Andrei Arlovski were set to star as well. So naturally with all of that tapped to be in the film you know I was excited to see this. In fact right here in Austin TX before the film was released on DVD there was a special screening of the film in October of last year.    This film is about a group of terrorists who kidnap a Prime Minister's kids and then demand that their fellow terrorists are released from jail. A time limit is set and they will kill the kids and blow up a Nuclear Power Plant, of course you know what that can do. Add in that they have the next level of Universal Soldier at their disposal since trader scientist Dr. Colin has created the NGU. The NGU stands for Next-Generation UniSol and he is one bad dude. So naturally all plans are set into motion and they even bring back the original UniSol Luc Deveraux who is trying to work his way into normal society.    Now of course some where in there Andrew Scott is brought back via a clone and is upgraded of course. So the big show does are expected and of course you will eventually get them. I must say that the best thing about this film is just that, the action and the fights. Naturally with Van Damme and Dolph back and Mixed Martial Artists Arlovski and Pyle you know this one is good. There is plenty of gun fire in this film but it is the hand to hand that I really enjoy, especially between Van Damme and Dolph. They all do a great job when they lock horns in this one. But the story between Luc and Scott is just to good and adds to the emotion. Also I must say that the two do a good job in this one as far as acting, Van Damme seems to be channeling his performance from \\"JCVD\\" while Dolph just seems cold and emotionless just like the character calls for. The scene were he is going to kill the kids is great, his emotionless confused face is great.     Now with that said I must say that Andrei Arlovski really has another career he could go into because he did an excellent job in this film. Seriously he may be the best MMA turned actor I have seen, he actually is the star of the film and does a wonderful job. Same can be said for Mike Pyle who surprised me and it seems he may be back for the next film. Kerry Shale is great as the mad scientist that creates the NGU and gives maybe the best performance of the film. To be honest even with this being a B action film it really may be the best of all the sequals. It may also be considered a really good film, I think so.    Written by Victor Ostrovsky and directed by John Hyams it was obvious that they went into this wanting to make a really good movie.  John of course is the wonderful filmmaker behind the excellent documentaries on Mixed Martial Artists Renzo Gracie [Fight Day] and Mark Kerr [The Smashing Machine], I recommend both highly. I believe it was those documentaries that not only lead to the casting of Arlovski and Pyle but the understanding of how to make the fights look real. Along with his father Peter who shot this film [and was also the director on Van Damme's \\"TimeCop\\" and \\"Sudden Death\\" films] they made the film feel real and gritty. In fact in some ways this may be better than the first film. To be honest the writing on this film was great and went beyond the standard b action sub par script, real dialogue.    Honestly I do recommend this film and not only for a rental I am a proud owner of this film. Of course I am a huge MMA fan and that has a lot to do with it and am also a fan of Van Damme but it is still a really good movie. If you do get the chance to see this film I a sure you will enjoy it. This film as a very good script, good cinematography, good direction, and some good performances, I was surprised by how good it was. Maybe going in with low expectations helped but it really is a good film. I say give it a try.    There are some great special features like behind the scenes and a great commentary.
B002SSUQFG|1.0|I thought i got a good deal on this but when i received it yesterday, was so dissapointed how simple of a watch it is, it is way too small for a mens watch, a kid can use them, and the band is not leather as describe in the infos, i should have read the descriptions first, will return it, darn the hassle of returning!!! You can get this elsewhere for $20 and thats only how would it worth this watch..
B0021L8V1G|4.0|You know you have an all star cast when Samuel L. Jackson plays a bit role.  Is there anyone out there looking forward to \\"The Avengers\\" movie in 2012.  Robert Downey Jr. is one of my all time favorite actors.  The dude can play any role and make you believe he really is the character he is portraying.  I swear there are times that I now think he actually is Tony Stark.  How can the guy be so versatile?  In addition to these two you have Don Cheadle adequately playing the role of Lt. Colonel Rhodes, with Scarlett Johansson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Sam Rockwell and of course Mickey Rourke rounding out the bunch.  Jon Favreau even continued his role as the body guard while directing the movie in the background.<br /><br />For me sequels are always a little hard to swallow since the initial introduction to the general theme has been lost.  You go into a sequel knowing more of what to expect so they are easily predictable.  Iron Man II was just that.  It was predictable in the plot, theme, general flow but setting that aside it was also pretty damn good.  Filled with action, great acting, and as always in the world of Tony Stark, lots of sarcasm and a bevy of smoking hot women.  The latter being one of my favorite parts in any movie.<br /><br />The opening scene kicks off with the Tony Stark (Iron Man) jumping from a plane and landing in the middle of some Las Vegas dancers, as he kicks off his yearlong expo on technology.  Is there anyone but me that thinks they were making fun of some needless trade shows out there?  We find out a few minutes into the movie that Tony Stark's much heralded power supply is actually killing him.  He doesn't have long to live.  He then spends a good chunk of his time trying to find a replacement source to save his life, and to keep his suit charged up for some good ass whooping.<br /><br />When you throw in Ivan Vanko, who is just one badass dude, you now have the makings of a struggle for supremacy, with good fighting evil.  Isn't that what super hero movies are all about.  Mickey Rourke might be a bizarre guy in real life but every time the guy gets on screen he shows you why he is a great actor.  When Iron Man replicas start popping up trying to kill Tony off, the action begins and everything around everyone starts blowing up.  What can I say, if you love action movies filled with sarcastic one liners and a comedic overtone you will enjoy the movie.  There is an endless supply of both.<br /><br />I would have to surmise the movie was predictable but definitely enjoyable.  I can laughingly say this review might even be a waste of time since everyone on the planet has probably seen the movie already anyway.  If you haven't then you probably should.  You will know what to expect when you enter the theater and you will leave not having been disappointed and in my opinion thoroughly entertained.bout.

B0015DROBO|5.0|While this novel had a bit of a slow start for me (bear with the author for at least the first 70 pages, please), once the story really got rolling, I hated to put it down. This was definitely a good read, but not until you've read \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\", will you truly appreciate this gone-too-soon author's storytelling ability. Please don't read only the first in this trilogy, as the second book contributes so much to understanding some of what makes Salander tick. Have pre-ordered the final book of this trilogy for my Kindle, and am anxiously awaiting its arrival.

B0000TAZBK|5.0|Simply put, the best musical score by the best composer made for the best films based on the best novels of all time. This music is extraordinary and will live forever, along with the movies it was created for. It is incredible in terms of technicality, and epic in the way it evokes emotion from the listener. I have often been moved to tears by the music alone. I feel no one has, and no one ever will, come even close to reaching the utter flawlessness of these films or their musical composition.

B0026P7O6K|5.0|When I first heard Halestorm it was on our local alternative station, well I just saw them live last night and all I can say is WOW! I have never been a big fan of female led rock bands, not a sexist thing just never have found too many that can hold my attention. This band will from the very first song, and if you get a chance to see their show live...you will not regret  it.
B0038KHTGC|5.0|Note: this review is for \\"Wicked Symphony\\" ONLY, not for \\"Angel of Babylon\\".    When I first listened to this album, I found myself involuntarily comparing every track to the latest Edguy album, \\"Tinnitus Sanctus\\", which, in my opinion, was an absolute failure and disgrace to that awesome band. In this review I will try to steer clear of that comparison, but what an amazing comeback for Tobias Sammet from last year's terrible fall with \\"Tinnitus Sanctus\\". I hope you can find this review useful.    First and foremost: Tobias' voice sounds simply INCREDIBLE on this release. It never fails to amaze me how powerful this guy's voice is and just how much he can do with it. Every vocal track that he recorded for this one is superb. I know it's a big statement, but to me he sounds better than he did in anything he has recorded since \\"Mandrake\\". No joke.  Next up - guitar work. Awesome! Great riffs, catchy solos, dual-guitar shredding, absolutely no complains here. I strongly believe the guitar work is much better on this album than the previous Avantasia record, \\"The Scarecrow\\".  Next in line - catchy-ness of the record. Absolute winner here as well. This heavily determines the replay value of the album, and this one does not disappoint - you will want to listen to it over and over again.  Last but not least - production. Very clean, no distortion, amazing work by the production team. Long songs (8-9 minutes) are present here as well, so that's a winner for us \\"epic\\" fans.    Overall, this is my favorite CD of 2010 so far. Tobias - you hit it this time, man. Thank you for the incredible album.     P.S. And - let's not forget Klaus Meine from Scorps turning in an amazing performance on \\"Dying for an Angel\\"!
B002WIDRM6|1.0|If you like the song \\"Need You Now\\" (\\"NYN\\") and thinking about buying this CD. DON'T!!! Just download the single and be done with it. The rest of CD is mediocre at best, not anywhere near the nice melody and lyrics of the title song. Listening through the CD, I think I can tell that the song \\"NYN\\" is culmination of many trails and errors of previous songs. The hint of \\"NYN\\" can be discerned in some other song on the CD. I love the song \\"Need You Now\\" but dislike the rest of the CD.
B000TEVJYS|3.0|All of Massive Attack's albums are too short. I do like the beats, 9 or 10 is hard for me to shell out ten bucks for. They are not hard to produce, and many more would fit on a cd. So why not increase the value?<br />Other producers like Madlib or Dilla release albums with 20-30 tracks, they are shorter (around 2 min. each) but you get more variety. And when listening to \\"Trip Hop\\" a 5+ minute song is a bit long. I'm putting this on my wish list for now, but not buying yet. I recommend Theivery Corporation.

B001UJUGZY|3.0|Possession starring Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), Michael Landes (Final Destination 2) and Lee Pace (Pushing Daisies) is the American remake of Korean director Young-hoon Park's 2007 movie \\"[[ASIN:B000B6TT64 Addicted (Special Edition)]]\\".  And like most American remakes of Asian films, something got lost in the translation.<br /><br />Originally I had no idea that this was built off of Addicted, I was more interested in the fact that SMG, Michael Landes and Lee Pace were all in a movie together--separately I love them, I couldn't see a problem with seeing them altogether.  Objectively speaking Possession isn't a horrible film.  The storyline is a good one, the acting is fair and atmosphere was there aplenty.  It falls apart with the narrative structure and pacing.<br /><br />After the accident, when Roman(Pace) is convincing Jess(SMG) that he's her husband Ryan(Landes) Jess begins incredulous (and highly offended), but pretty quickly it seems as if Roman's superficial evidence is breaking down her defenses.  Grief certainly plays a part, but common sense seems to have fled completely.<br /><br />Much is made of the difference between the ending that is attached to the movie and the alternate ending in the deleted scenes.  Was it a better ending?  I guess it depends on what you thought Jess believed.  The two endings are very different for all 3 characters, but neither really fit in my opinion.  In neither ending does it detail if what Roman/Ryan said was true (in regards to how she felt about Roman).  One is highly ambiguous and the other teases at the possibility that what he said was true and she was hiding it.  Also in one ending its more of a 'supernatural' twist then the other.<br /><br />The movie as a whole isn't very supernatural, its definitely more of a psychological thriller, but there would be odd little flashes where it almost seems like they wanted to hint at there being something supernatural at work, but didn't take the time to properly expand upon it.<br /><br />I wouldn't suggest seeing this movie if you enjoyed Addicted.  All the problems that Ring-u fans and Ju-on fans had in regards to the American remakes stands very true for this movie as well.  However if you are a fan of Sarah Michelle Gellar or Lee Pace, I'd encourage you to rent this movie.  Lee Pace is wonderful and Sarah is enjoyable to watch as well.wouldn't suggest seeing this movie if you enjoyed Addicted.

B0015HOFZI|5.0|This Sony Turntable is fantastic.  Easy to hook up and ready to play.  The plastic quality is pretty good... I thought it would be really cheapo... It has an elegant look rather than a cheap look to it.   The lid lifts with ease so if you want to close it while the record is playing it won't skip!  The lid can be removed as well.. Great sound! I was amazed. I hadn't listened to my records in years and I forgot how much better quality LPs have than CDs. The sound is crisper and the highs are higher and lows are lower in sound!!  Has more of a live sound! Now I just have OK speakers so I can imagine the quality with good speakers.  This Turntable has power too. My receiver volume level is barely turned up and the volume kicks it!      I am so happy with this purchase!  I have seen turntables in Best Buy for $199 so this is a great deal!  It is so much cheaper to find old albums costing from 99cents to $3 rather than CDs or downloading.  The best part is   the fantastic sound quality that CDs are missing!
B0034EEE2E|5.0|Listening to Beach House takes you into a feeling - if you take it too literally or try to deconstruct its meaning, I think you're missing the key value here - ethereal, emotional spaces in which to wander occasionally in your day to day. If that's your kind of thing, then I highly recommend this group, and particularly this album.
0142428213|4.0|Stephen King has written yet another interesting and gripping book.  He never fails to explain details that a reader would never consider such as, in this case, he shows why each of the charactors think the way they do instead of only looking at the main charactor's point of view.  As usual, there are many unexpected twists and turns which keep readers on the edge of their seats.  The only reason I have for not giving this a higher rating is that the choice of readers in some of his latter books have been a little disapointing.  As someone who must rely on audio books, I find it much more interesting when the reader uses several different voices.  I realize there's no replacing Frank Muller but there are many other readers out there who are still great story tellers.  This reader was also disapointed in the fact that the volume was constantly having to be adjusted.  This would be worth the extra expense in my opinion.

030726999X|4.0|Stieg Larsson completed the third novel in the Lisbeth Salander trilogy, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, by lifting the darkness from the middle novel, and pulling all the pieces together by the end of this 600 page installment. I don't know how the language flows in the original Swedish, but this English version provides fine dialogue throughout, and a narrative flow that made pages fly by a dozen or more at a time, as I wanted to bring this story to its end. I found the resolution very satisfying, and realized at the end that with Larsson's death, I will miss Salander, and remember her as one of the most memorable characters in modern fiction.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (Highly Recommended)
0971407614|5.0|The science seems totally sound, and obviously works since this author trains U.S. Special Ops soldiers.  The comments from Colonels, Generals and Sergeants is impressive to me.  The Motivation section alone got me thinking about how much more important my body is than anything else I own!  He also writes about excuses that people tell themselves, and I've never heard it put in such a powerful way as Mark Lauren does.  If you don't get fit, your life IS \\"second rate.\\"  And it's never been made more simplified on how to get in shape than it is in this book.  As others have written, you just jump into the level of fitness that you are at, then keep improving!  After two weeks I can tell this is changing my body, from strength to flexibility to endurance to posture. I'm really starting to enjoy my body again.  Yet, the biggest change has been in my spirit.   Definitely give this program a shot. I know everything doesn't work for everyone but I see no down sides to this.  I even like that you don't need expensive equipment, just stuff around the house.  One thing I thought of though, is that I would like to see a DVD put out too as I am a visual learner and would enjoy that.
0393072231|4.0|Michael Lewis is an adept storyteller, and his latest book, The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine, presents a perspective on the subprime mortgage fiasco with both explanation and captivating drama. Lewis introduces readers to eight odd individuals, each of whom saw the subprime mortgage market problems and found ways to profit from their prediction of the market's dramatic fall. Readers looking for a comprehensive presentation of the financial crisis can find hundreds of pages elsewhere. In this book, there's an entertaining quality, perhaps schadenfreude, at the ways in which these eight characters gained from the misery of others.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (Highly Recommended)
B003AYBD7W|5.0|I'm a Styx fan but most of my recordings are on tape and vinyl (you might remember them?).  As  music fan I read discussion boards and gathered that Styx on cd wasn't so hot so hearing Audio Fidelity, a label that specializes in re-issuing titles with an ear toward those who are more fussy about how things sound were to issue this gold cd I thought I'd try this one.  I was pleasantly surprised to hear a glorious midrange coming forth on my system with decent bass and treble detail too.  While I cannot say I've compared this to each and every issue ever put out it does sound really good and for the modest $20 plus shipping I paid feel this is great value providing at least a decent version you can play instead of the record.  Having bought many remastered cds only to find them hard to listen to for any length of time this one I can recommend.
B001HN6940|5.0|Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and ALICE IN WONDERLAND certainly have NOT lost their muchness.  In fact, they are full of it!  I have to admit, I went into ALICE IN WONDERLAND expecting the worst.  I had heard some terrible things from friends who had already seen it, and the trailers didn't give me much hope, either.  But since I frequently believe in six impossible things before breakfast, I decided to try ALICE IN WONDERLAND for myself. And I am so glad that I did.  ALICE IN WONDERLAND is an incredible mash up of Lewis Carroll's two Alice books - \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There.\\"<br /><br />Let's face it.  Tim Burton is a very odd director, and the original Alice books are quite odd themselves.  Put the two together and you get amazing brilliance.  Remember, Disney's animated Alice in Wonderland is not very true to the source material; rather it is, well, a Disneyfied version of a small part of Lewis Carroll's original works.  Carroll accomplished quite a feat with the Alice books:  he wrote a fanciful story that really appealed to children, and combined it with a strong satire very relevant to the political world of the time.  And perhaps the most astonishing thing of all is that his works continue to be so well known.  Many, many words and phrases from the Alice stories have become part of our lexicon and are still in use, even today.<br /><br />But, back to this film rendition of ALICE IN WONDERLAND.  This ALICE IN WONDERLAND opens with Alice, age 19, about to get engaged.  She doesn't really want to, but it is what is expected of her.  We realized that Alice is an unusual girl:  she has a mind of her own, modern ideas, and she has been plagued by mysterious dreams all her life.  Alice is dreading her engagement (she doesn't even particularly like the young man), when suddenly she is distracted by a rabbit...in a waistcoat, no less!  Of course, she follows him, avoids her own proposal, and falls down a rabbit hole.  Once she lands, a long, long way down, there are many of the expected Alice experiences from the original book, ending with Alice eventually being the right size to enter Wonderland.  Once she is there, people keep asking if she is THE Alice, the REAL Alice, and Alice slowly begins to understand that her dreams...her nightmares...have perhaps, maybe, been memories.  But is she the real Alice?  Is she the champion?  And can she save Wonderland from the Red Queen?<br /><br />Tim Burton works his usual brand of extraordinary magic bringing Wonderland to life.  The sets and effects in ALICE IN WONDERLAND are outstanding - dark, colorful, and wonderfully weird.  The bandersnach, the jubjub bird, and the jabberwock look very similar to the original illustrations and exactly as I have pictured them in my head all these years.  Dee and Dum are definitely Tweedly.  And the beamish vorpal sword does indeed go snicker-snack on the Frabjous day.  The Rev. Dodgson would have been amazed and proud at seeing his imagination brought to life so vividly.  The acting and voice talent are incredible, including the incomparable Johnny Depp as the appropriately mad Hatter, Stephen Fry as the voice of a delicious Cheshire cat, Severus Snape, uh, I mean Alan Rickman as the voice of the hookah-smoking Blue Caterpillar, Mia Wasikowska as a near perfect Alice, Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway as ideal opposite foils portraying the Red and White Queens respectively, Christopher Lee as the terrible Jabberwock, and a veritable host of others.  The cast assembled for ALICE IN WONDERLAND is what makes this film click, and all put in amazing performances.<br /><br />I can certainly see that ALICE IN WONDERLAND is not for everyone.  It is a very odd and strange film, but, in my humble opinion, in a good way.  And in a way that is true to Lewis Carroll's original writings.  If you like the bizarre and unusual, if you think you CAN believe in six impossible things before breakfast, then this ALICE IN WONDERLAND is definitely for you.  My husband and I really loved it, when we had not expected to.  It really surprised us.  And that is what defines ALICE IN WONDERLAND as a truly great film.efinitely for you.

B0036S4B6M|1.0|Read the free chapter sample and thought it was good, that's where the good ended.   A book on buying toothpaste, making cheesecake and the really sexy stuff like taking a shower without a full curtain.   Some scary parts like when Larry kissed her a second time and got yelled at by one of the guards.   Sorry, I think I just gave the whole story away.
B0017V7GTY|5.0|All I can remember is my old man pissing and moaning about how there's no good music anymore.  He misses the old days.  When I was 12 my Dad introduced me to The Clash, and my mother never forgave him for it.  Since then I've a little bit of Strummer in my step.  Well, with all the belly-aching about piss poor music I never thought I'd find an album I could share with the old man that he'd like...until I heard this.    It's easy to get behing a \\"working mans band\\" when you've never been a working man.  Let someone else do the tough stuff and you can enjoy the tales they tell with their raspy voices.  You can read the lyrics they write with their calloused hands.  But for an ACTUAL working man to get behind a band...that's something special.    My Dad is 46 and tough as nails.  He's worked the long hours and been run through the grinder more than his share.    And he Loves The Gaslight Anthem.  You're welcome Dad.

0316666343|4.0|It is tough to write something about this particular book that 3,000 other reviews have not already said.  Based on the popularity of the book alone, there is obviously something quite good about the book.  At the same time, it is not without flaws.      The plot is centered of the murder of young Susie Salmon.  While this event sets the plot in motion, the story line branches in so many different directions.  Among the flaws in the story is the subplots pulling so far away from the central story that it seems to become an afterthought. The initial chapters had the eerie feel of a true crime work told from a different prespect.  Then, the novel follows the people left in the aftermath of the crime.  This is not a problem in itself other than it follows the people too far and too long.  The extend of the details borders on digression.    The killer, Mr. Harvey, is a fascinating character that the author seems to reveal just enough about.  Yet the lack of a strong conclusion to this character was the most maddening part of the book.  This aspect of the story seemed rushed and incomplete.  I was not expecting a neat and just ending, but I would have preferred more than a two page end to the villain.    Overall, \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is an entertaining book that borrows elements of the supernatural and true crime to form a book that most readers can give positive feedback.  It is not without flaws, but the positive outweight the flaws by far.
B001I5M9SC|5.0|I thought when I bought this it would provide some nice entertainment, and my wife and I would make small talk during the performance.  Wrong!  I was glued to every note that Andrea sang. I was taken to another place, Tuscany to be precise and it was wonderful!   His voice is second to none, and I was blown away by the quality of vocals and instrumentals that I heard.  The performance would have been great just with Andrea himself, but what took this over the top was all of the guest performers.  Kenny G (Sax), Lang Lang (Piano), and Chris Bottio (Trumpet) who accompanied Andrea Bocelli showed how well beautiful music can delight the soul... it was truly riveting!    The duets with Heater Headley, Elisa, Laura Pausini, and Sara Brightman took this concert to a level I did not know existed.  I can not wait to play it again for their awesome female voices complemented Andrea Bocelli like nothing imaginable.  I was not familiar with Heather Headley and I fell in love with her voice, and the magic she had with Andrea.  Sara Brightman was my favorite, and I could never get tired of listening to these two sing together.  WOW... INCREDIBLE!    The backdrop of being an outdoor concert in the beautiful country side of Tuscany was breathtaking.  The color and clarity of this blu-ray on my 150\\" screen was outstanding, and I was transformed to another world.  What a perfect place to perform, it was so easy on the eyes.  I want more....  I wish they would have offered a DTS MA audio track in the set up menu, but there was only two options: PCM Stereo and PCM 5.1.   We have a very nice high end sound system in a dedicated theater and the PCM Stereo was great.  I will play it next time in the 5.1 format.    I am an audiophile by nature.  I love all types of music, hard rock, pop, jazz, and classical are my favorites.  If you have any true appreciation for the finest quality of music at its purest form, with the absolute best vocals and instrumentals that exist today, then you oweit to yourself to give this Blu-ray Disc a try.

B002S0OBN2|5.0|** May Contain Spoilers **<br /><br />Many have approached this latest offering from Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber with a lot of disdain. There are those who adore the original Phantom spectacle and curse Webber and the day he dreamed this show up. For his many critics (and there are many), they will view and/or listen to this and highlight its flaws and diminish the successes (not that there is no room for criticism of course, I am simply referring to those that take great pride in bashing Webber). After all, during the last couple of years, I had read and reread countless posts, blogs from many passionate detractors (including many \\"Phans\\") waiting for the chance for \\"Love Never Dies\\" to be released so they can pounce all over it and send it to theatre oblivion where it belongs while many others loudly thanked and elevated Webber's feline companion to near sainthood for accidently deleting this score from his masters computer a few years back. Hoping this would convince Webber to axe the idea once and for all (never underestimate the creative energy of a composer on a mission and in love with his work).<br /><br />Well, to me, that is a shame as I have finally listened to the score and wasn't at all surprised on how much I loved it. Since I am a big fan of previous Webber scores; \\"Evita\\", Jesus Christ Superstar\\", \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" and even his \\"Aspect of Love\\" which despite not being his best show had a lovely score, I knew that in typical Webber fashion, his latest musical would have at least one or two songs that will command my attention. I was not proven wrong. Overall, the music in \\"Love Never Dies\\", is sumptuous with the Phantom and Christine obviously having the best tunes of the bunch. I will state, that in comparing it to the original, the score is different. There are lesser moments of operatic grandeur. This should be expected from such a drastic change in setting, taking the action out of the Paris Opera House and placing it amidst the grittier spectacle of turn of the century Coney Island and unlike the original, the songs themselves are not as instantly catchy. It may take a few extra listens for you to appreciate the full beauty of some of these melodies. Some of the highlights include:<br /><br />\\"The Coney Island Waltz\\" - Lovely instrumental track which opens the show. Not as instantly recognizable or as epic as the original's \\"Overture\\" but the melody and orchestrations are splendid.<br /><br />\\"The Aerie\\" - A lovely instrumental track with lush orchestrations. The tune is brief but poignant and is reused in various other parts of the musical to great effect.<br /><br />\\"Till I Hear You Sing\\" - An emotional ballad sung by the Phantom. Beautiful and melodic, the song is enriched by the gorgeous rich tones of Karimloo's powerful vocals.<br /><br />\\"Look With Your Heart\\" - A charming ditty sung by Christine and her son Gustave.<br /><br />\\"Beneath A Moonless Sky\\" and \\"Once Upon Another Time\\" - This entire scene between the Phantom and Christine during their first reunion is a powerful one (probably even more so on stage) and the songs are exquisitely sung by the 2 leads. The melodies, especially \\"Beneath a Moonless Sky\\" are haunting. Definitely one of Webber's loveliest tunes and a score highlight.<br /><br />\\"The Beauty Underneath\\" - This song has had mixed reviews but I happen to love it. Yes, it sticks out like a sore thumb since the screeching guitars and drums differs from the romantic strings of previous songs, however, it works. The melody is quite infectious and the mix of the 2 voices, the Phantom and the young Gustave, is a great combination. The song also incorporates parts of \\"Beautiful\\", the previous track.<br /><br />\\"Why Does She Love Me\\" - Great song. Showcases Raoul in all of his tormented glory.<br /><br />\\"Devil Take the Hindmost\\" - A duet/confrontation between the 2 male leads leading up to a bet involving Christine.<br /><br />\\"Love Never Dies\\"- Christine's aria writtenspecifically for her by the Phantom is beautifully sung by Boggess.<br /><br />Some of the score is reminiscent of \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" and \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\" and despite some lack-luster numbers, the positives far outweigh the negatives. Many people are having issues with the lyrics but I do not see them as a problem. Let's remember that Charles Hart's lyrics of \\"Phantom\\" were hardly acclaimed and considered awful by many. If that musical works its mostly due to the success of Webber's music (and Harold Prince must be given credit here too) as it's the foundation that holds the entire piece together. When the fans listen to that cast recording time after time, whether it's the original London cast recording, the Canadian cast recording or the film soundtrack, it is not the spectacular visuals or the slick direction or production values that have them intrigued, it is the music and I think \\"Love Never Dies\\" will have the same effect on those undiscriminating listeners just wanting to listen to a haunting melody.<br /><br />I was somewhat surprised at the drastic change in characters and unlike some reviewers, I find these changes refreshing. As much as I love \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", with the exception of the Phantom and that Grande Diva \\"La Carlotta\\", the characters were a bit bland. Everyone is practically in agreement that Raoul and Meg were boring and rather useless and although Christine herself was interesting in the sense that she sang the best tunes in the show (she was in practically every scene...well almost), she spends most of her time in a trance so there is not much range of emotion and she was far too naïve to excite any real sympathy. That was then, this is now as Raoul, Meg and Madame Giry have become rather selfish, loud and mysterious creatures. The complete opposites to how they were originally portrayed. Raoul's drastic transformation is believable in my opinion because, well, we didn't really get to know him in the original piece and a lot can happen in 10 years. The Giry womens' obsessive, rather unpleasant personalities is explained: the Phantom's everlasting love for Christine leads to what they see as the ultimate betrayal. These changes in character gives this musical a darker, grittier edge when compared to the softer brush strokes of the original. With that said, the 2 main characters remain the same overall. The Phantom remains as obsessive, as dangerous, as loving as ever while Christine, although more mature, still retains the charming characteristics of Ms. Daa&eacute; of a decade earlier.<br /><br />The leads deliver on all fronts, at least on this recording. Ramin Karimloo (The Phantom) and Sierra Boggess (Christine) are fantastic in their roles with solid, gorgeous vocals, delivering just the right amount of emotion. Joseph Millson is also noteworthy for portraying the still unlikable but far more interesting-this-time around Raoul, Vicomte de Chagney. While Raoul was a cookie cutter pretty boy with no real personality the first time around, he is an embittered, angry-at-the-world failure here. Millson does a great job in capturing his complex personality while still managing to inject some likability into this damaged persona.<br /><br />\\"Love Never Dies\\" works as both a sequel and as a standalone piece despite the drastic changes. Those enamored with the syrupy romance of the original may find plenty to dislike here as this tale deviates considerably from its predecessor and as previously mentioned, the stark changes in character personalities may be hard for some to swallow. The climax may also disappoint those expecting a more conventional ending. I have not seen the stage show (hopefully it will come to Canada) but listening to the music, I find this to be Webber's best since \\"Sunset Boulevard\\". Taking into account the setting, the music successfully captures the era and the love songs are ravishingly beautiful. The score may sound repetitious at times as some of the songs are repeated throughout. There are also brief moments in the score where melodies from Webber's original piece, \\"Little Lotte\\", \\"Twisted Every Way\\", are mixed in with the new, but there is no denying the beauty that permeates the score. When the Phantom burst into his songs and Christine beautifully sings her aria showcasing her delicate soprano, it all comes together to create a certain magic. The Phantoms return may not please all as is evidenced by some of the reviews but if you are accepting of it, you may find yourself surrendering to the music all over again. Recommended.<br /><br />Note: Webber or collector fans may want to dish out the extra dollars for this 2CD/DVD Deluxe Edition. It not only comes with the cast recording but also a bonus DVD with interviews, behind-the-scenes etc and booklet. The other recording has no extras.

1439138311|2.0|The author, in this particular novel, does not appear to empathize with the characters he created.  Instead it seems that he composes cliche stereotypes that lack any sort of development despite the life changes he puts them through.  Contributing to this lack of character development is the fact that Toibin spends a great number of pages providing very intimate descriptions of minor characters and settings which do not impact the story line.  This overly descriptive writing style causes the book to slowly plod along despite the \\"devastating news from Ireland\\" which provides a ghost of a conflict.      In spite of the tedious writing I did like the story that Toibin was trying to get across: the dual life of an immigrant and Eilis' inability to fully identify with either life she had created for herself in Ireland and Brooklyn.  But rather than choosing to develop this inner conflict, the author brushes it aside in favor of Eilis doing what is honorable.  There were so many opportunities for Toibin to develop her into the woman Rose had intended for her to be in coming to America, but Eilis shows an astonishing lack of comprehension of the world around her (i.e. she was unfamiliar with the holocaust) and of her own self-awareness that she remains flat, uninteresting, and difficult to sympathize with.      Lastly, Toibin provides excellent descriptions of the setting in Brooklyn that seem more fitting to the 1920's and 1930's rather than the 1950's.  Although I cannot speak for what Brooklyn was truly like in 1950, the absence of the impact of WWII and the constant references to ethnic segregation so prevalent during the time America was a \\"melting pot\\", make it difficult for me to believe in the time-frame in which the author chooses.    Unfortunately I would not recommend this book to a friend, although to be fair, there are enjoyable passages within the book.

B001QOGYBI|3.0|I saw the previews for this movie, but like most nowadays I missed any chance at going to see it in the theater, so I had to do with renting it and watching it at my home.    The thing that attracted me most to the movie was the animation and the stars. George's deep, even voice against Meryl's beautiful, low tones seemed like an interesting match for a movie like this, and the animation- stop-motion- has become quite popular with movie-makers. But ironically, the thing that made the film most famous- its animation- is the reason I couldn't give it five stars.    You know the English- they've got their own breed of quirky, fun humor that I fully enjoy. This movie certainly feels different somehow, perhaps the lack of color and adult-feel to the story has to do with it. It's a quiet, cute movie, and yet it feels weird. I know the fans will hate me for that, too.    And the animation is... well, it contributes to the odd sensation of the film. It's artistic and interesting to observe, but stiff and jerky. The characters have a lack of movement, and it feels ridiculous- like the scenes where they all dig into the ground? It looks really bizarre, not to mention the scene they get flushed away by cider. So the animation, I think, takes away from the charming feel of this little movie. Had they done it in CG, it wouldn't have been so famous (I mean, there's so many CG movies, I guess I understand why they chose to do stop-animation to be different), but it would have helped the story.    But my ranting done, it's a good movie, and worth a watch. It's got bits of humor sprinkled here and there that made me laugh, and Mr. Fox's son reminded me a lot of a friend of mine, which made his character all the more enjoyable. Certainly not for kids... with an amount of violence that I'm guessing strict parents would hate their babies to watch. But adults and teenagers will most likely enjoy. I found it a little boring at parts, but it smoothed over with a pretty good message and some good speeches from good old Meryl and George. Some other smaller parts are snagged by actors that'll make you be like, \\"Whoa- he's in here, too?\\" The deep, rumbling voice of Michael Gambon as one of the deranged, scary farmers made me chuckle- because everyone likes a reminder of our old wizard, Dumbledore.     So a good idea, a cute plot, but bizarre. Watch if you want, buy if you're a die-hard Wes Anderson fan.

B002ODEJYE|5.0|Not a huge pink fan but this blu-ray is one of the great ones. The picture quality is amazing and it has amzing sounds. If you have a surround sound system be sure to crank it and you will feel like you are at the show.
B002N5N4MG|3.0|I absolutely loved the first two seasons of this show and entered this season with a lot of enthusiasm, but I must admit I've been a little disappointed with it. I've still found some enjoyment from it, but I have some qualms. I'm all for character evolution, but are we to expect that Sheldon would, a the drop of a hat, change his eating schedule so he could have dinner with Penny? The show has practically been built around Sheldon's crazy idiosyncrasies, and then one of the major ones that has been harped on in the majority of the episodes goes out the window in one scene? Also, Leonard's character changed in, for me, unpleasant ways while he was with Penny (I hope it will be better now that they are not together). Instead of the kind, innocent guy who was just trying to live outside of his genius physicist stereotype he suddenly got upset and angry far too often for my taste. It just feels like a different show this year. I can only hope the season finale will be a set up for a better season next year.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|James Cameron has meant quite a bit to me since the time I was a child.  Growing up with sci-fi epics like The Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss, and Terminator 2 had a profound effect on my love for the science fiction genre, and seeing Cameron make not only a return to the genre, but to film making as a whole in his first true foray since Titanic, makes Avatar a worthwhile trip on its own merits.  Sadly I didn't get to give it a shot when it was released to theaters, missing out on drinking the Cameron kool-aid as it became the highest grossing film of all time, but now that I have finally managed to give it a look, my initial reactions are that this is nigh-epic sci-fi storytelling at its near best.  Effects-wise, Cameron has crafted something truly special.  Not just the characters and creatures, but the planet of Pandora as a whole is a living, breathing thing that must be experienced to be believed.  However, said experience would be best suited had this home video release been in 3-D like the film was and always has been intended to be viewed.  Fox is infamous for DVD double-dips, and this Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack is no different.  While both versions of Avatar are gorgeous looking, all that is featured here on this set are both home video versions of the film.  No special features, nor any 3-D capable version of the film, which in itself is a slap in the face to consumers.  There will no doubt be a super special edition of Avatar in the near future, which fans and collectors should definitely hold out and wait for instead of picking this bare-bones version up.  As for the film itself, as technically spectacular as it is, it isn't without its share of flaws, most notable being the predictable brand of storytelling, stilted dialogue, and the fact that Sam Worthington's Australian accent more often than not cracks in his speech.  Still, Worthington is a star in the making (he was one of the few highlights of Terminator: Salvation), and Stephen Lang is surprisingly perfectly cast as the wicked Colonel Quaritch.  All in all, Avatar is an epic sci-fi/action tale, but don't even bother adding this bare bones release to your collection, and bide your time before the inevitable special edition is released.rfectly cast as the wicked Colonel Quaritch.  All in all, Avatar is an epic sci-fi/action tale, but don't even bother adding this bare bones release to your collection, and bide your time before the inevitable special edition is released.
B0035KGWR2|2.0|Well whoever produced this album blew it.  I was another person really looking forward to Amy's second CD.  If I had been at a friends house and heard A Curious Thing as my introduction to Amy I would not have gone out and bought it and probably never would have bothered to track down This Is The Life, which was a fantastic CD.    All of the things you loved about This Is The Life are gone from this CD.  The angst, the emotion, the stipped down instrumentals are all gone.  Instead what you have is way to many instruments that play WAY to loudly and bury Amy's vocals somewhere in the background.  So what this accomplishes is that now you can't sing along to any of the songs because you can't hear the words.  And the next thing that goes south is that you can't even tell what the stories are that are behind the songs because you can't understand the lyrics.  That is what made This Is The Life SO great.  You could hear the stories and feel Amy's emotion while telling them - well so sorry, you can't do that here, her vocals are buried.  So sad, that sophomore slump has hit again.  How many times lately has a fantastic first CD been followed up by a bad second effort?  Maroon 5's second effort was weak, Evanesence stunk up their second release. I can think of one artist that got the 2nd effort right - even better than the first and that was Brandi Carlile.  But Brandi had T Bone Burnett producing her 2nd effort.  Amy, I wish you had T Bone, because this producer did you no favors.

0061339202|4.0|Although a bit repetitive and dense at times, and sometimes old in its approach (I especially didn't like how the author sharply demeans so-called parapsychological experiences) I think this book is still a classic and an important book to read for whomever is seeking for more enjoyment, joy, appreciation and sense of purpose in their lives and needs a sound, scientific explanation of why that joy can be found in the simple act of paying attention.

B003EPPEP4|4.0|I feel guilty giving this c.d. 4 stars, in a way.  This is, after all, a debut c.d.  I believe in being kind to jazz singers out of the box, and I've given 5 stars to inferior initial productions from singers not as talented.<br /><br />So, Mr. Paganini, why am I all of the sudden being such a meanie?<br /><br />Make no mistake about it:  the 16-year-old Nikki Yanofsky is enormously talented.  Check out her sensational scat on \\"I Got Rhythm\\" and \\"Paganini,\\" for example; or her infectious swing on the c.d.'s best cut (IMO), \\"Bienvenue Dans Ma Vie.\\"  And check out her voice:  although a bit nasally, it's naturally big.  Already, she's one of the few jazz singers working today who can drive a big band.  All of that is consistent with a 5-star production.<br /><br />It's just that this c.d. feels almost artificially produced.  Phil Ramone is the Producer, A440 Management is the Management Company, Feldman & Associates is the Booking Agency, Decca is the Record Label, and the insert tells us how to buy Nikki Ringtones for our cell phones.  It feels almost like this group of ravens converged on this wunderkind and directed her how to become an American Idol, jazz style.<br /><br />Consequently, the hype surrounding this c.d. - \\"The next Ella Fitzgerald!\\" or \\"The next great young singer!\\" feels forced.  Wait a minute - isn't that what we were saying about Roberta Gambarini a few years ago, or Melody Gardot last year?  I mean, I became pretty well convinced about Roberta and Melody; I don't have enough room for another ultimate young jazz diva in my universe!<br /><br />For example, the opening cut is \\"Take the 'A' Train.\\"  The chorus is impressive enough.  Then the verse is some vocalese about how great it is to visit New York City.  I.e., Nikki sounds like a tourist; but I want my jazz singers to be residents.  Give me Shirley Horn, any day.<br /><br />Let's revisit this in 20 years.  After all, in 1988 the 20-year-old Harry Connick, Jr. was dubbed as \\"the next Sinatra.\\"  Does anybody out there seriously think, 22 years later, that he really is?<br /><br />I have a funny feeling, in listening to this recording, that in 20 years Nikki Yanofsky will be rubbing elbows with Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood.  Put another way, if I had to predict on this evidence, she'll be the next Nat King Cole:  a great pop singer who started out as a great young jazz singer.<br /><br />However it plays out, here's hoping that Nikki Yanofsky well mines the goldfield of talent that she has.  And let's hope that she has surrounded herself with the kind of people who will allow her to do that - and that she doesn't go the route of Britney Spears along the way.  RCs later, that he really is?    I have a funny feeling, in listening to this recording, that in 20 years Nikki Yanofsky will be rubbing elbows with Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood.

B00361HV02|4.0|Let's get the main point out the way: this is a fantastic album. For a lot of BRMC fans, the question with each release is whether we would see a return to the bluesy acoustic sound we heard on Howl. This CD opens with a steady guitar strum that makes you think that this might be a return to Howl's sound..and then things get kicked up a notch, and you realize that this is going to be a fun ride.<br /><br />For the uninitiated trying to decide where to start with BRMC, I would break their albums down as follows: BRMC (their self-titled first album) is solid Jesus & Mary chain - influenced rock. Take Them On..., (their 2nd CD) is darker and less catchy but still within the same soundscape. Howl is a break from form, with an all-acoustic sound. Baby 81 is poppier than their previous CDs, but a return to the full-band rock sound. Beat The Devil's Tattoo is closest to Take Them Own... stylistically. If Baby 81 was a bid for a more mainstream sound, this album  sounds like a loud embrace of their indie roots. It's thick and gritty and not really that catchy, but it's still my favorite CD of 2010.<br /><br />Other reviewers have hit on a lot of the highlights, but I'll add a few favorites of my own: Aya (a really dark and powerful jam) and the driving title track. I'll also join the chorus of praise for the closer Half-State, which proves that sometimes songs are good enough to deserve ten minutes. If you're hungry for good old fashioned rock without the sentimentality or emo vibe of most current bands, then this is the album for you.
B0008ENIAC|3.0|An archaic and rather lengthy film with an unusually detailed storyline--some of which touches on universal themes of human nature--avarice, seduction, ambition,fraud, etc.  Enjoyable to watch the stars of old, but really couldn't get into the more ludicrous aspects of the plot.  The ending in particular made little sense when you think about it.  Logic is not this film's strong point.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Obviously this is not the dvd with all the special features, but that does not matter.  It is a good deal and watching Avatar in Blu Ray was amazing.  The colors, and special effects made it stand out even more.    If you do not care about the special features then this is a great buy!!!
B002ZG98VE|3.0|I'm all for them making Robin Hood into a more realistic hero, but this movie felt more like a combination of Braveheart and Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven (both vastly superior films). While watching it today, I couldn't help but feel bored. I'm a fan of the director, Ridley Scott, but he needs to stop with these historical epics. He is suppose to be making a prequel to his first big hit, Alien, in the future, so that's good news.<br /><br />Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett are good here and elevate the material. Mark Strong adds another memorable villain to his resume. Over the last six months or so, this dude has been the lead bad guy in three movies. This is probably his best work in the realm of evil, followed by Kick-Ass and then Sherlock Holmes. William Hurt shows up for a paycheck, but Max von Sydow's character is very warm and makes you care about him, even in a small role like the one he is given here.<br /><br />The fight scenes and music score are decent, nothing worth remembering. The PG-13 rating hurt the realism a bit, with not much blood to be seen, but it is still plenty violent in it's own right. I do have to say that the costumes and sets are top notch.<br /><br />The funny thing is, the last five minutes is when I began to really get into it. The whole outlaw part had just begun as Robin retreats to the forest. If they cut out an hour from earlier on and added in this aspect, I think it would have been much better. Maybe they are planning a sequel to tell that side of the story. That's the steal from the rich and give to the poor Robin Hood I want to see.<br /><br />If historical epics are your thing, this deserves a Blu-ray rental. It's pretty mediocre, which proves that one of the greatest marksman when it comes to directing, Ridley Scott, can't always hit the mark.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|This is one of the best shows on TV. It is worth the watch. I recommend starting from season one. I've enjoyed this show from the beginning and it's still has my undivided attention. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles are terrific as the Winchester brothers killing the baddies and never giving up on family.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|WOW! How is it possible that this show can continue to improve this much? I will admit, for awhile there, the show had its stumbling points. \\"Fallen Idols,\\" \\"Sam, Interrupted,\\" and \\"Swap Meat.\\" But those were completely overshadowed by \\"The End,\\" \\"Abandon all Hope,\\" \\"The Song Remains the Same,\\" \\"Changing Channels,\\" and \\"Swan Song.\\"<br /><br />These episodes were the best out of the entire show! I have never experienced emotions towards characters like I have in this show. The writers have a gift in creating an aura and a feeling about the story that is genius.<br />In this season, we finally saw Dean come to terms with Sam's blood issues and \\"dark side.\\"<br />We also saw some very risky character deaths,(I won't spoil who it was) And as much as I hated to see them go, what it did to the story was profound.<br />I give major props to Kripke and Gamble for their risky decisions in this year's story arc. For it totally paid off. I can't wait to see what happens in season six. I am so pumped.

B0013XW2F4|4.0|The Kindle version of this DOES have a table of contents. In fact it has several which is probably why it is not linked from the Kindle's menu. When you open this in Kindle it starts on the first page of A Study in Scarlet, but if you press the previous button a few times you'll find not only the TOC (with working links) for this novel but going further, a TOC link to each book in the volume. I've also created bookmarks for the TOC's so I can find each of them easily (a personal quirk). As far as the content of the books, what can I say? It's Sherlock Holmes! You won't be disappointed. --Another happy Kindle customer :D

193413712X|1.0|I was really looking forward to reading this \\"celebrated\\" book.  I love detailed descriptions of mechanical things and the human reaction to the Zen of craftsmanship.  I rarely read novels and thought this might a good growth experience for me.  I could only manage to plow through the first third of the book and finally gave up out of utter boredom and a frustration with trying to penetrate it's dense incomprehensibility and lack of coherence.  For my next novel I will probably try to find something with a little better combination of literary elegance, a discernible plot and level of interest such as \\"Birdsong\\" by Sebastian Faulks.  I am left puzzled by the judgment of the Pulitzer Prize jurists.
B001HN69B8|4.0|First time through the film, one can be a tad antsy trying to place this experience in the standard envelope.  After the commentary, you learn to go with the flow. You may also find a pattern.<br /><br />I will not give a blow by blow of the story but I found the concept of people from a different time of the world contrasting with today's lifestyle. Not necessarily, the main theme but a major is that of going through the mirror. It has been used from Alice, &quot;Through the looking Glass&quot; and even the contemporary movie &quot;MirrorMask&quot;. I wonder if it has a deeper physiological meaning that I missed.<br /><br />We also get to kibitz as Doctor Parnassus (Christopher Plummer) banters with Mr. Nick (Tom Waits) and we all know how that classily turns out. The only time anyone comes out ahead in negotiations was in the film &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot;. Will Parnassus beat the devil?<br /><br />Therefore, the film is satisfying on many levels from the acting to the visuals to the on purpose lack of a structure to the story. The name Parnassus has a meaning in its self. Yes, there are Blu-ray extras; luckily, they do not distract from the movie.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|This movie is inspiring, everything in it is beautiful, the story, the direction, the acting, the graphics, the new world, the new space and other creatures approach just everything.  I like it my son like it and even my 2 years old daughter love it, she snakes and sow it with out our notice.  I highly recommend this movie to everybody, it is a must see movie.
B0039SFKSW|5.0|I ordered Omega the day it became available for pre-order two months ago. As a die-hard prog/rock fan, you can't do any finer than Asia (my old Alpha cassette wore out from continuous playback). If something similar were to happen here, it would be a testament to this great band. Downes has been one of my keyboard gods, along with Tony Banks. Wetton's voice is so versatile and therapeutic. I am delighted he seems happier and more vibrant than he has in years, leaner and confident, too; at 61, he can sing the sing the socks off of people half his age. Carl masterfully holds the floor, as drummers do. Asia is a band where real talent, real peformance, and real songwriting count and sadly is a vestige of the past. Thank God the bandmates care to keep putting out music that shows the young turks of today how it is done.     At first I thought Phoenix was a better album; it had more prog orchestration. Omega reminds us that Asia is a pop/rock band. It is peppier. I don't care how commercial it may sound; that is what sells records and what makes songs and albums memorable. Omega is in that fold. It has grown on me since its release. The ready nade hits are good out of the box- Finger, Holy War, I Believe. The latter is right in line with Days Like These- upbeat and uplifting, great motivational works. Love the synth brass blast in the first few measurex of Finger. Listen Children has surprised me as being both light and provocative; the line about \\"dance the holy night away\\" has a spiritual touch, which is a characteristic and goal of the band. The Howe/Wetton tracks are very good, and, like Phoenix, I am grateful Steve has had a chance to showcase his songcraft. There was a Time is a nice poetic piece reflective of the British Isles; the chorus rises with the thumpimg of Wetton's bass.     I don't know what the future holds of modern music; personally, I think it went off the cliff after Nirvana in the 90's. Omega is a refined sound of a band true to their sound and era, a calling card to the future. Keep it up, guys. Blessings to you.
B003747252|3.0|The concept sustained me through the book but unfortunately Robert on too many occasions leads his characters to behave oddly which breaks the illusion too often. A moment of the future is given to all of humanity due to an experiment undertaken with CERNs LHC. The book explores the impact of this event on those scientists that undertook the experiment and spends far too much time in &#34;who did it&#34; territory when one of the scientists discovers that in the future he will be shot. On the whole an intersting read but seriously undermined by odd plot choices amd charecters acting out of character !
0307454541|5.0|Stieg Larsson's early death is a great loss, sadder still as the then-unpublished trilogy he left behind is sweeping the globe.  The Swedish title of the first novel, released in America as Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, was Men who Hate Women. That, and the quotes that he puts in his Part Separators and his storytelling manner telegraph his strong commitment to telling Larsson's truth about men's violence against women.  There are even rumors, not yet backed up by any evidence, that he was murdered for his political beliefs.<br /><br />What intrigues me is the canny way he was able to manage Point of View, the subject I've been teaching this summer.  Technically, the book is an extended argument for large omniscient narration.  We dip into key character's heads only long enough to establish their motivation and quickly move to another character.  The novel's obvious protagonist is Mikael Blomkvist, but the reader doesn't stay with him long enough to make it \\"his book.\\"  Blomkvist has a passivity that, while it may make him suspect to American audiences, works to the overall advantage of the book and Larsson's sweeping vision.  In a book filled with manipulative controlling men, Blomkvist has the knack of lying low and letting the world come to him.<br /><br />Larsson's cleverest nuance might be related to Salander, the novel's second protagonist, the strong female with the dragon tattoo.  In a separate character-developing subplot, Salander violently turns the tables on a man who rapes her.  Salander plays a major role in the major plot as well, using her hacker-investigator skills to assist Blomkvist solve the central mystery of the novel.  Half Blomkvist's age, but fully his equal or superior as an investigator, Salander falls for Blomkvist, and hard.  She is one of several strong female characters with whom Blomkvist metaphorically dances for the length of the novel.  Sexually, they come to him, which allows Larsson the space to weave his tale with no neediness on the part of his protagonist.  This fits with his theme, which seems to be that women can do wonders on their own if they're not subordinated, through trickery and even violence, by men.  It works.is protagonist.

B001OQCV6A|4.0|\\"Sherlock Holmes\\" portrays the downside of the \\"Renaissance Man.\\" Imagine being able to outthink, outwit and outfight most people and then become trapped in a cocoon of self-misery based on these facts alone. The genius and lamentations of Sherlock Holmes is excellently played by Robert Downey, Jr. While one usually would need to be an anglophile or at least appreciate the backdrop of England (circa) 1880's--1900's, Downey and Jude Law make it fun.  The intellectualism of the characters is a breath of fresh air from the mindless, hackneyed movies normally on the modern day roster.    \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" is an odyssey through human nature and the need for illusions, whether it is the need to believe in the dead or delusions of grandeur based on self importance.  \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" shows the upside and downside of human nature and the vagaries in between.    I highly recommend this movie for the comedic erudite.     Edward Brown  Core Edge Image & Charisma Institute
0307346617|5.0|The way its told as interviews from individuals who lived through it is amazing.  Loved it and as I said finished it in one sitting during first part of flight and the first layover.  If you have a love for zombies you need to own this book.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|So .... I love all things Star Trek. I can watch ANY episode/movie from any of the series ... over and over again.     I saw this movie when it came out. I walked out when it was over ... completely stunned!!! They took the entire franchise and basically yelled ... DO OVER!? Alternate time line starting basically at Kirk's birth? A NEW Star Trek?     Hmmm     Let THAT sink in!     Well ... I could argue both sides of any argument related to the script ... holes can be justified etc ...       But WHY did I watch the shows in the past?     I have watched and re-watched this movie several times ... and BAM ... it dawned on me ...     From day one ... Original Trek ... to ME Star Trek was all about the interaction between Kirk, McCoy and Spock! I loved how they participated in action/adventure ... and still had a sense of humor!! THAT is what fueled my love for sc-fi!!     When I watched the movie originally ... I was distracted by the already famous actors ... Simon Peg, Karl Urban, etc ... so the first time I saw the movie I spent more time adjusting ... in my head I could see their prior characterizations ... I was seeing them individually ... I was seeing more of their past work than the characters I had grown to love in the TV show. In re-watching the movie ... OMG ... they are SPOT ON with their renditions! They used juuust enough common phrases ... mimicked just enough actions ... had just enough humor ... yes they could definitely pass for ALTERNATE TIME-LINE VERSIONS of the originals ...      In rewatching this movie ... I dont think it is intended to replace the original ... I HAD thought that it was ... but no ... THIS IS NOT A REMAKE ... it seems to take the Star Trek franchise from 1963 into 2010 ... if it feels dumbed down .. welcome to our current reality and every other movie out there ... it is a sign of the times.     The loss of Vulcan, Spock's mom, Kirk's dad, etc ... it will affect the future. The changes were difficult to watch, knowing they prollywon't be taken back ... but maybe change is good? I didn't like the Uhura/Spock kiss/relationship ... I coulda done without that bit ... but he is actually the most logical choice for her.         I hope they keep making movies based on this alternate time line and that the makers of this movie thought ahead and contracted the main actors for many films to come!!      When I look at the Original TV show/movies ... and this new movie ... seeing there is nearly FIFTY YEARS separating them ... I feel I can only compare the FEELING I get from the main characters (the duplicates from the original series) ... is it the same feeling I had from the original series?? I take into account ... that writing styles have changed, society has changed, special effects have changed, people have changed, ETC ... BUT I take it all in ... and then ask myself, what feeling did the new characters give me?? I can say that the new characters were cast so well ... that I can definiely imagine the new cast as the originals ... thrown back in time to begin a new set of adventures based on a different time-line/alternate reality.          This movie had action/adventure ... the good guys and bad guys were VERY sexy ... good sci-fi story line which enabled a beloved character from the first series to join the cast ... Uhura had more to say/do than spin in her chair and say \\"Hailing frequencies open sir\\" ... etc etc etc ... I will re-watch this movie for years to come.     I plan on buying the 2 disc set to see the deleted scenes and have a digital copy ...     Buy it, watch it, love it!
B000BBOUU4|1.0|I finally decided \\"heck, I have some time why not?\\"    So I sat down and watched this. My friend had a DVD. To be brief and straight to the point the movie was not amusing to watch whatsoever. The following were the issues:    1. No charm, especially in terms of Johnny Depp's portrayal of the original movie's Willy Wonka. He was just weird and that's about it. He was not fascinating.    2. No magic    3. No suspense. This goes hand in hand with number 2. The whole movie opens up straight out and doesn't ever build much suspense and so the magical, mystical feeling the first movie had was not found in this remake. I mean many people have already watched the first one so they already knew what to expect, so a smarter way to approach this is to change the plot much more and combine it with a solid wall of above average acting and ideas. However, this movie didn't do any of it. I watched it feeling very bored.    4. Pure Imagination. Man this song is the song that gave this movie a lot magic, at least it did for the original. The new movie didn't have one single catchy song. A good movie, especially one that has singing, has at least a catchy song or two.    5. Oompa Loompas are changed in a weird manner. They are no longer fat and short, now they're like little elves, not to mention they all look the same - in other words FUGLY! I liked the old oompa loompas. However, it does seem to make more sense considering their candy commercials feature similar versions.        I'm glad the movie is over and I agree with all the negative remarks. This movie does Johnny Depp no real favor because the acting in this movie does not exploit his full potential whatsoever. Johnny Depp is much more than what he portrays in this movie. The original actor for Willy Wonka was significantly more suited to the role.       Horrible movie, will never watch again. If someone gave me this movie, I would either try to sell it off or throw it away. Trash. Johnny Depp is awesome, stop misusing histalents and wasting it.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|This is my introduction to Radiohead.  Can't say enough good things about it.  Incredible disk.  Favorites include Bodysnatcher which, unfortunately, I've been told is atypical of the Radiohead sound.  They can really rock when they want to.  Other favs include House of Cards, Weird Fish, Nude, Reckoner...Actually everything but perhaps track 5, which is a little weak.<br /><br />Planning on moving on to more and unsure which direction to go.  I'd like to stick with the more mainstream sound for now, before exploring the more esoteric stuff.  Perhaps OK Computer?<br /><br />I can't recommend highly enough.  A very enjoyable listen.  I've been drifting into house and down tempo stuff recently and this may pull me back to more guitar-based alternative.<br /><br />I know this won't be particularly helpful for people reading reviews, but there are other, much more qualified music geeks with outstanding reviews of the disc that you can check out.  I will say that if you're considering your first purchase of a Radiohead disc, this would be an excellent starting point!

1597801577|4.0|I don't read sci fi as a habit but happened to pick this out. When I originally wrote this review I had just finished the book. Since, I have reread it and picked up nuance here and there that I had overlooked. I am far more impressed after a second reading. It is sort of a look at the world after it slips off the edge. Society is still there and has some organization unlike most post apacolyptic efforts. Little scary, little(lot) sad, for those of us that may have unfounded concerns about where we are headed. Or maybe not so unfounded as I watch congress daily.
030726839X|2.0|My initial reaction to the book was quite positive, but faded slowly as my expectations were unmet.  The author's admiration of Churchill while declaring his failings prompted an unfulfilled expectation of an account that looked at both the successes and failures and how they related: Did they reflect conflicting aspects of his personality or were they simply different facets? Unfortunately there is no such yin-yang.<br /><br />While the book _asserts_ that Churchill was the great leader, what it _discusses_ are his various disastrous decisions and his limited influence with the allies.  As other reviewers have noted (eg, Geoffrey Wheatcroft in a 2010-04-26 NY Times review), while Churchill's energy, willfulness and inspiration was critical in keeping Britain from surrendering, this book leads the reader to consider Churchill's contributions as a net negative starting shortly after the US entry into the war.  The author may have expected the readers to have the details of Churchill's strengths and accomplishments at their fingertips, but this is unreasonable for the general audience.  And the omission of this coverage is not due to a lack of space: There are plenty of trivial and tangential details that could easily have been omitted.<br /><br />On Churchill's major mistakes:  Anyone with an intermediate interest in WW2 history is likely to be aware of all of these except \\"the second Dunkirk\\". The treatment of that event left me unclear whether it was Churchill's fault (confused leadership) or that of a dysfunctional, incompetent military bureaucracy that he inherited.  The book's account of the decision-making process is unsophisticated and terse: It first provides a quick statement of Churchill's characteristics behind his bad judgment, followed by an enumeration of the officials who opposed it and then a statement that Churchill prevailed by force of personality.  Typically, the coverage of the results of the decision goes far beyond what is needed to convincingly demonstrate its folly.  It recounts details that are irrelevant--being far outside Churchill's purview (eg, the movements of individual battalions)--and that are well-covered in many previous histories.  There are long stretches where Churchill's name is not even mentioned.  What I had expected was an emphasis on what led up to the decision and why the problems had not been anticipated or were downplayed. (NOTE: this is my biggest interest in reading history)<br /><br />The book's coverage is maddeningly uneven. For example, the various Greek debacles get detailed coverage, but problems that seem to me to be even bigger failures get only passing mention, without any indication of the degree of Churchill's awareness of them and what, if anything, he tried to do about them.  For example, gross failures in various major army commands in the use of intelligence, including Ultra. For example, situations that appear to have inflicted more damage to Britain's industrial capacity than German bombers: Substantial manufacturing capacity wasted on obsolete and useless armaments; shoddy manufacturing that required substantial repairs to make weapons usable; large quantities of armaments repeatedly damaged and destroyed during shipping because of negligent handling and grossly inadequate packaging.  Related example: The convoys to Russia were taking tremendous, unsustainable losses--ships and sailors--but the book paints a picture that much of what they were carrying was useless to the Russians (obsolete, damaged).  Despite the _issue_ of such support to Russia being a top-level strategic priority, the book again fails to address Churchill's involvement.<br /><br />Similarly, one of the major themes in the book is the limitations/failures/inferiority of the British Army, both its leaders and its soldiers.  While the book covers Churchill's frustrations with various individuals, it didn't give me any sense of whether he was aware of the claimed institutional problem.  My inference is that he wasn't because I didn't spot evidence that his plans accommodated such. Furthermore, I speculated that Churchill, himself part of these institutions, was partially blinded to the underlying problems (but less than most). While the book provides some support for this--primarily in the descriptions of failed commanders--it doesn't go any further.  This is surprising in the context that Gen Marshall's reformation of the US Army is a major topic of WW2 histories.<br /><br />Throughout the book we are told of the military's objections to Churchill's constant \\"meddling\\".  If this involvement was in fact so _overwhelmingly_ negative, the book fails to reconcile this with its repeated assertions of Churchill's brilliance, knowledge and tenacity. For example, even if Churchill's proffered _solution/idea_ proved to be unworkable, had he identified a real problem and in the process forced the military to address it?  Or were they simply off-the-wall distractions?<br /><br />The book's focus on Churchill is too extreme, diminishing those around him to insignificance.  If this were a movie, no one among the British cast would qualify as a supporting actor, some would be bit players, but most would be merely extras. This was too out-of-balance to be credible to me.

Furthermore, I speculated that Churchill, himself part of these institutions, was partially blinded to the underlying problems (but less than most). While the book provides some support for this--primarily in the descriptions of failed commanders--it doesn't go any further.  This is surprising in the context that Gen Marshall's reformation of the US Army is a major topic of WW2 histories.<br /><br />Throughout the book we are told of the military's objections to Churchill's constant \\"meddling\\".  If this involvement was in fact so _overwhelmingly_ negative, the book fails to reconcile this with its repeated assertions of Churchill's brilliance, knowledge and tenacity. For example, even if Churchill's proffered _solution/idea_ proved to be unworkable, had he identified a real problem and in the process forced the military to address it?  Or were they simply off-the-wall distractions?<br /><br />The book's focus on Churchill is too extreme, diminishing those around him to insignificance.

B002ZG977Y|3.0|Ok, so I went to see the 2nd C of T and thought the special effects good. I thought that the Medusa & the Kraken were excellent.  The problem with the CGI was that it seemed rushed to me and over in incredubly short  spurts of time, and rather slap dash. The story was very choppy and the acting really mostly awfull.  I remember the 1st C of T as being an adventure/romance with a story, no matter how pat or corny that story was.  And its ok to change stories and essentially recreate the story, but it is definately not ok to to have Sam Worthington as Perseus.  So lets put Mr. Worthington next to Mr. Hamlin and I wouldn't think twice who Andromeda or Io would go to bed with.  Sam Worthington playes a sort of Roman pissed off military type as opposed to a mythological Greek hero and he compares badly as a romantic hero as well. Sam Worthington is essentially playing a angry young man with a buzz haircut.  There is no sense of renewal at the end of the 2nd C of T, even the reimmurgence of Io is just slapped on, no continuity, no meaning.
B0002XNT0I|5.0|One could justifiably say that Philadelphia is a film that changed the world.  And I just did.  lol    I will not waste anyone's time on plot delineation or the inspired casting, soundtrack, writing, directing, editing, given, who has not seen this classic at least once?    What I will do, is encourage everyone to buy the 2-disk anniversary edition with all the bonus material, every part of which is an augmenting gift.    Gifts from the commentary track to the principals sharing how and why they came onboard---in Denzel's case, serendipitously---and gestated a meticulous collective vision of the property in its real potential, to the  evolution of the script, to,  that the scenarist. Ron Nyswaner, realized it was his moment to come out, to Jonathan Demme's two-element inspiration to commit to making this film:  first, Demme  sustained criticism from the LGBT community for the portrayal of Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs, and second,  his wife's best friend, a gifted young artist originally from Spain, Juan Botas, was diagnosed with HIV.    There are two documentaries on the second disk, one of which is a stand alone work... an inspiration of & partly shot by Botas, who died of AIDS during its making.  It chronicles the reality history of HIV, and depicts paradigms of human courage and character on deep human levelsof the sort we are rarely privy to.    The collective gifts Philadelphia demanded & achieved over time is the issue.  And, notwithstanding that some virulent activists, i.e., the late Larry Kramer, railed against the film, saying it capitulated to Hollywood...such criticisms comprised a small minority.    Beyond Philadelphia qualifying as a classic, when we also have the privilege of knowing every part of the creative process of a team of of importantly talented humans in any endeavor, I think there's not much more nourishing or inspiring.
B002ZG98VE|2.0|The title reference is for the climactic scene, a reverse seaborne invasion in which director Ridley Scott apparently bought all the Higgins landing craft from \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", painted them brown to simulate wood, stuck on some oars and swung them 180 degrees around to attack England!<br /><br />But this latest edition of the famous myth seems to borrow from several movies, notably the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy (Nottingham resembles the Shire in all its pleasant, pastoral heartiness. All Friar Tuck {Mark Addy} needs is a pair of hairy feet), \\"Braveheart\\" and \\"Gladiator\\" among others. The plot, itself, is pedestrian. Bald-headed bad guy (Mark Strong) connives with French to have them invade England. Robin and his merry men (and woman) foil the deed but then are outlawed for taking all the credit from their envious king.<br /><br />The actual history is all shot to hell, not that the average viewer will care. There are some disturbing \\"Taxes equals Tyranny\\" references that should fire up the Tea Party crowd but King John (Oscar Isaac) is portrayed more as a buffoon than a tyrant. Sure, he tears up the Magna Carta but we know that eventually, he will sign it at Runnymede in 1215, an act that will safeguard the rights of the nobility and ignore the common people completely (a fact the Tea Partiers would do well to remember).<br /><br />But there are some high notes and the viewer is gratified to find some chemistry between \\"Lady\\" (not \\"Maid\\") Marion (Cate Blanchett) and Robin Hood (perfectly cast by Russell Crowe). The opening siege of the French castle is a lot more exciting than the confusing beach battle scene at the end and the rollicking dance sequences look genuinely merry. Max von Sydow and a surprisingly cast William Hurt anchor the drama as well.<br /><br />Overall, however, this new edition reminded me of a big dinner at a fast food restaurant. An hour after it's over, you don't really remember it. The real Robin Hood deserved better.
B000026KGC|5.0|Not much can be added to the other good reviews here, so I won't elaborate much on them.  I concur with them that Anthem and the other original compositions are the standouts, but the covers are notable also, especially the incredible arrangement on River Deep, Mountain High.    Book of Taliesyn is simply a must-have for all followers of Prog Rock, but not so much for fans of later Deep Purple (\\"Mk II\\").  Hard Rock buffs may have a little problem getting into the refined vocals and much more thoughtful and complex compositions on tBoT.      I followed Deep Purple closely for their first several albums, up through \\"In Rock\\" where they veered of into the less creative but more commercially successful genre of hard/metal rock. [I feel the track \\"Child in Time\\" from that album was their swan song to Prog Rock, and a superb one too.]      I had cherished my English imports of their first four LPs, and was very frustrated that they were not released on CD in the US (until recently).  I was shocked and delighted to find them on CD in 1996 in a hardware store in Istanbul, Turkey(!)
B000002GK1|5.0|One of the very few solid 90's hard rock/metal bands and albums.  Amazing vocals, great riffs, and truly amazingly crafted songs a true classic.
B000026KG7|5.0|If you have found yourself at this level, looking at obscure groups from the late sixties, and arrived at Deep Purple, you have discovered the motherload of Progressive Rock roots.  If you are looking for more \\"Smoke on the Water\\" and Machine Head material, you won't find it here, that stuff is childish by comparison with this material.  There is no better example of very early Prog Rock than Deep Purple 1968-1970.    They had reached the peak of their collective creative powers by the time they arrived at this their third album.  With all but one original composition (Donovan!), this album combines moody organ and harpsichord foundation, acid guitar, polished vocals, and classical string arrangements to create a truly spooky atmosphere matched only by the bizarre and justly famous cover painting by Hieronymus Bosch (1450-1516).    Don't be mislead by what you think you know about Deep Purple.  Although they saw their commercial success only from subsequent releases, the earlier years of 1968-1970 were when they were the most creative and innovative .  Their work from this period includes the very ambitious classical/rock compositions by Jon Lord; Concerto for Group & Orchestra and Gemini Suite.  Approach these with an open mind, and you won't be disappointed.    Still interested?  Check out their first two albums, The Book of Taliesyn and Shades of Deep Purple.  \\"Shades\\" includes their early hit Hush, and \\"Book\\" their second hit, Kentucky Woman (Neil Diamond composer).  Those may be the 'hits' from those two albums, but the original compositions are the real gems.

B00111YM5G|5.0|The Angel that IS Andy Whitfield! Andy could be my Angel any day! The passion he has in the characters he portrays is divine and those blue eyes of his will capture you! Those blues eyes really show up in the Arc Angel Gabriel and as he is sent from the heavens to Purgatory to save souls and battle the dark angels who have taken over, he splashes on to the screen with a presence and intensity that you can really appreciate! You can see from this role why he was chosen for Spartacus. He is one of the most passionate actors of all time and I love and appreciate his work and will forever be a fan. He has so much heart and soul in the roles he plays, I am in awe!<br />The movie is a dark story of what the world would be like if all good souls were already gone and only the lost ones who don't want to be saved would be like. Gabriel is the last bastion of hope for anyone and he has a mission to succeed!<br />I won't spoil the ending but I will say that it is a great work to see the pre-Spartacus Andy Whitfield in action! It was way cool I thought! There could definately be a sequel!

B002ZG98VE|3.0|This isn't your grandfather's \\"Robin Hood,\\" which in this case is neither a compliment nor a criticism. It's just what is. Director Ridley Scott makes no attempt to romanticize the legend, probably because we've seen that take on it so many times before. And why not? The Robin Hood we've heard about makes for a wonderful story - he's handsome, strong, daring, moral, and radically philanthropic, having robbed from the rich to give to the poor. He's the perfect hero, a figure that can inspire desire and idolization even in children. As far as I'm concerned, it makes perfect sense that he's been the star of so many film adaptations. We like heroes, especially when they stand for something that I'm assuming most of us believe in.    We don't really get that from this new Robin Hood, here surnamed Longstride and played competently but not exactly memorably by Scott regular Russell Crowe. While he has very definite ideas about how people should be treated in general, he's not a selfless defender of the people so much as a common soldier, an archer, serving his king. He has been fighting abroad in the Third Crusade for the last ten years, but after Richard the Lionheart dies in battle, he decides that it's time to return to England. Three other soldiers - Will Scarlet (Scott Grimes), Allan A'Dayle (Alan Doyle), and the Little John (Kevin Durand) - tag along, perhaps because Scott know that it wouldn't be \\"Robin Hood\\" if these characters weren't included. When Robin comes across a dying knight, named Robert Loxley, he solemnly promises to return a sword to his father.    For reasons passing understanding, Robin assumes Loxley's identity upon returning to England, where he must deliver the bad news that the King is dead and see the crown passed on to Richard's younger brother, John (Oscar Isaac), portrayed as an arrogant fool who imposes harsh taxes on his kingdom. His right hand man is the evil Sir Godfrey (Mark Strong), who, because of his heritage, has his own sinister plans for the future of England. What is poor King John to do but make those beneath him suffer, especially when he knows that his kingship was a gift given to him by God?    Robin and his men travel to the village of Nottingham, where the blind elder Walter Loxley (Max von Sydow) decides it would be financially beneficial for Robin to continue posing as his dead son. Here enters Loxley's widow, Lady Marian (Cate Blanchett), a strong-willed and cunning woman who will inevitably become Robin's love interest, despite her efforts to resist him. I might have bought into this medieval romance had it not been so obviously constructed. Consider a scene in which Robin is preparing for a bath; when only Marian is around, he calmly tells her that he needs help undoing his chainmail armor. Nothing immediately comes of this, but the implications are none too subtle. And then there's the scene of them sharing the same bedroom; Marian threatens to cut off ... a very sensitive part of Robin's anatomy if he even tries to go near her. Given this confrontational viewpoint, how can she not eventually end up loving him? There's a reason we have phrases like, \\"Opposites attract.\\"    There's no denying that this movie is well made from a technical standpoint. John Mathison's cinematography and Arthur Max's production designs are astonishing, evoking not an idealized storybook world of feathered caps and merry men but the dark, gritty reality of the Middle Ages, where soldiers were caked with dirt and cottages were infested with rats. There's also an impressive array of visual effects, although I suspect they were diminished by the film's PG-13 rating, especially during the violent battle scenes. Scott has made a name for himself as a visual director, something I've never objected to except when it comes at the expense of great performances and fully developed screenplays. \\"Robin Hood,\\" while efficiently told, doesn't aspire to be anything more than a great-looking historical epic. It has alot of style, but when it comes to substance, something is lacking.    Maybe that something is originality. Even with the names and locations associated with \\"Robin Hood,\\" this movie is fairly generic, offering little that hasn't already been offered in other recent medieval stories. Robin could have gone by Sir Michael and Nottingham could have been called Green Meadows - the effect would have been exactly the same. The only thing it has going for it is the fact that it reinterprets the Robin Hood legend, relying a little more on history than on the excitement of a swashbuckling adventure. I won't say that this is a devastating failure for Ridley Scott, but I will say that he could have done better. Given his reputation for rereleasing his films in expanded and/or alternate cuts (\\"Blade Runner,\\" \\"Kingdom of Heaven,\\" \\"Legend\\"), perhaps the best version of \\"Robin Hood\\" is yet to come. One can only hope.
B0021L8V1G|2.0|WOW! What happened here!?  After such a surprise smash of an original, how could this sequel come off so . . . well, boring?      I admit, at first I found the slower pace refreshing.  After all, isn't that the direction every other sequel takes?  Bigger, louder, faster, less plot?  So when the film opened with about twenty or thirty minutes of talk revolving around Tony Stark's insistence he's got \\"peace privatized\\" while a senate subcommittee isn't so sure, I was actually interested.  When we saw that Stark was being poisoned by the very tech that was keeping him alive (as Jarvis so conveniently spells out for us slow viewers), again, intriguing . . .    Here's the problem - this stuff is supposed to be the setup, NOT the ENTIRE MOVIE!  Yes, at the 90 minute mark (literally, I checked my watch) when Stark was STILL dealing with these same issues, I was no longer pleased with the slow pace - I was BEGGING the movie to start doing something interesting!  Minus the \\"race track\\" sequence (most of which you've already seen in the trailer) the first half of the film has zero Iron Man action (unless you count a drunken brawl between Stark and Rhodey - a glorified barfight).      By the time the woefully underused Mickey Rourke FINALLY unleashes his devious plot to assault Ironman with a batch of robots, the film has a mere 20 minutes left to go - and the ensuing climatic battle feels like what it is - a perfunctory, tacked on conclusion - seemingly included only because the filmmakers begrudgingly admit they are, in fact, making an action movie, and not a dramatic comedy.  As such, the final showdown between Ironman and Whiplash takes up all of about two minutes, and then the movie sprints for its closing credits.      Also wasted as the lovely Scarlett Johansson, who has, as I suggested in my title, the films only truly enjoyable sequence as she does her Matrix-Infused-Latex-Dominatrix best in taking down a squad of security cops.  When a redhead girl's stunt-double brings more excitement to your movie than the titular Iron-clad hero, there is a SERIOUS problem!    I think I understand what the problem is - the makers of the first film analyzed the reaction, saw that Robert Downey, Jr. got most of the praise for that film, and decided to build the sequel NOT around bigger and better action, but instead around twice as many opportunities for Downey to quip and mug and annoy other characters.  In fact, not only do they give us double the Downey, but they also introduce a rival arms dealer (Sam Rockwell) to do the exact same act, only for evil instead of good.      All this means that if you enjoy Downey and Rockwell (who are both great at what they do) and don't mind a film built on their overindulgence, then you might like this sequel.  But if you go in expecting a bigger, badder Iron Man, don't . . . this is one of the first sequels I've ever seen that delivers LESS action than its predecessor.    As others have suggested, at the end of the day, this film is essentially more a promotion for the supposedly upcoming AVENGERS movie - a film that is constantly being talked about and promised for some as yet unannounced future date.  If the further proposed films that are supposed to lead up to AVENGERS are as dull as this one, that day may never come.

B003102JDM|5.0|I can't think of a Coen Bros film that didn't intrigue me to the max (though I still haven't figured out \\"Barton Fink\\"). There seems to be nothing they can't attack and make it thoroughly entertaining. The DVD extras clearly explain that Judaic clerics were involved. The irreverence given to the Jewish lifestyle (and the traditions) are delightfully explored, with no end of guilt and fear. The Coens say it was an altered verson of their growing up in  the Minneapolis area in 1967. I graduated from high school in Milwaukee in '67, and the period detail as perfect. This homage to life in the Midwest was on target, and, though I'm a goy, the high school bullies, etc., were pretty much the same as I recall. The real story revolves around Michael Stuhlbarg's character, and his issues regarding home, family, job... and the angst that is created when confict arises. Stuhlbarg is nothing short of brilliant in his display of every known emotion,  a multi-layered performance worthy of awards. The whole cast was perfect. DVD extras were fine, with a special segment of Jewish/Hebrew words for goys. That was considerate. This is only another excellent achievement by the marvelous Coens; those Jews are a coupla wild 'n crazy guys. I can't wait for their next effort...
B002UZCJ8Y|3.0|The theme of Surrogates is a dark one - the world ends up being a facade that hides our true human selves - but with Bruce Willis in an awful hairpiece (which he chucks off later for his real manly look) - the show ends up being a mid level sci-fi piece and actioneer - instead of the film noir it should have been.<br /><br />A cross between Westworld, Blade Runner, Stepford Wives and I Robot, SURROGATES never soars or bores, but it could've been a lot darker and intriguing.  So many possibilities.  It just felt a little pat rather than gripping - as is the problem with so many Hollywood movies these days.  Still Bruce is good action eye candy - but this is definitely not 12 Monkeys territory.<br /><br />Fine for a DVD rental I suppose.  For another film like this - check out Arnold's Total Recall, which was more claustrophobic (and campy).  3.5 stars.
1423119509|4.0|If you know anything about Greek mythology, you'll know that their gods had a tendency to produce demigod kids by the dozen. And the \\"Percy Jackson and the Olympians\\" series is all about a boy who discovers that he's the offspring of a god, and the other demi-god kids that he gets to know at a very, very special camp. Rick Riordan spins a clever fast-moving adventure that mines ancient mythology and gives it a modern spin.<br /><br />Percy Jackson has always been a troublemaker, but he's shocked when some truly strange things begin to happen in his life. After a minotaur attack, he learns that he's at a special training camp called Camp Half-Blood intended for demi-god children, and that his best friend Grover is actually a satyr bodyguard. Though Percy is understandably resistant to the idea, he soon makes friends in the sharp Annabeth and the bitter Luke (and enemies with the kids from Cabin Ares).<br /><br />Oh yes, and he finds that he's the son of the god Poseidon... which is a problem since the \\"Big Three\\" gods have sworn an oath not to father any more kids, due to a rather ominous prophecy.<br /><br />As a result, Percy finds himself in the middle of some epic cosmic battles -- he must recover Zeus' master lightning bolt before the world is thrown into chaos; he must venture into the Sea of Monsters to get Grover and the Golden Fleece; clash with the Titan Atlas; embark on a journey into the legendary Cretan Labyrinth to save the camp; and finally battles against Lord Kronos to save Olympus.<br /><br />The Percy Jackson series is all a little Harry Potter in concept -- ordinary kid discovers he has magical powers, and is taught in a specialized school/camp while fighting against the forces of evil. Rick Riordan spends the first half of \\"The Lightning Thief\\" exploring the whole idea of Camp Half-Blood and the demi-god kids -- but after that, the series pretty much flows quickly to the slam-bang end.<br /><br />Riordan has a snappy fast-moving style, and he peppers the story with plenty of plot twists and monstrous action. And he has quite a sharp-edged sense of humor -- the snarkiness is a bit annoying in the first chapter, but after that he produces some fun dialogue (\\"With great power... comes great need to take a nap\\"). And he does a good job with the concept of gods and monster surviving over the center of the western world, as well as spoking some fun at the gods' behavior.<br /><br />I found Percy rather annoying in the first couple chapters, but Riordan slowly evolves him from a rather bratty, rebellious kid to a reluctant budding hero who will take on literally anything to keep his loved ones safe. Annabeth is an excellent counterpart to Percy, smart and measured if rather haughty in attitude, as well as the timid Grover, embittered Luke, punky Thalia and moody Nico. And the gods are portrayed in a rather clever, tongue-in-cheek way.<br /><br />It has a couple slow spots, but Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson and the Olympians series is a solid, fast-moving little fantasy series, with likable characters and plenty of wit.pers the story with plenty of plot twists and monstrous action.

0805091742|3.0|I have enthusiastically recommended the other two Gawande books, which I found riveting reading. This one I found far less interesting and in parts it is quite boring.   I also found myself wondering if he's being used to spread positive propaganda by some of the hospitals that he visits. He mentions a London one where he is shown around a fantastic operating theatre.   That hospital is in fact run by a NHS Trust which pays UK record damages to patients for negligence (figures available on the NHS Litigation Authority website), so probably is in dire need of his Checklist, as opposed to receiving high profile praise from him.   Patient infection is a huge problem in a number of UK NHS hospitals, and as his earlier books note, it is almost invariably spread by poor staff hygiene practices.   I have been damaged for life by post-operative, hospital borne infection received from one of this Trust's other London NHS hospitals, a hell-hole of incompetence.   My mother was a patient in the one Gawande mentions by name, and although the standard of medical care that she received was good, she was in an overcrowded, mixed gender ward where the space between beds certainly would not have satisfied anti-infection standards and where the hospital radio service providers moved from bed to bed introducing themselves by shaking each patient by the hand. Needless to add, they did not sterilise or wash their hands between patients.   So maybe for any future books, his research might be more rigorous.
B00005221L|4.0|Here's m thoughts on this movie: it's \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\"... but with a masked alien instead of a creepy guy with a satanic goatee. And that basically sums up this gory, suspenseful sci-fi thriller. which starts off as your usual macho BOOMBOOMfest but quickly mutates into something far creepier once the soldiers realize that there's an alien stalking them.<br /><br />Major Alan \\"Dutch\\" Schaefer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his team have been assigned to rescue a cabinet minister kidnapped by guerillas in Guatemala, which seems like a straightforward mission at first. And the guerillas seem to be an unusually brutal bunch -- while some of the pursuing soldiers have been captured, others have been brutally skilled and left to hang in the trees.<br /><br />Dutch's team basically blows up the entire guerilla compound and everyone in it, except for one woman (Elpidia Carrillo) that they take prisoner. But on the way back, their numbers start dwindling -- one soldier is dragged away and gutted, and another is shot through the chest with an energy blast. Something far worse than the guerillas is stalking the team through the jungle, and the unknown Predator is determined to kill everyone worth hunting.<br /><br />The first half of \\"Predator\\" is about a military operation with lots of gunfire and explosions, and the second half is a harrowing, blood-spattered chase with the men getting picked off one by one. Yeah, the plot isn't very complex, but it's handled in a very intense manner -- lots of sweat, dirt, grease, jungle foliage and sudden eruptions of blood and firepower.<br /><br />There are some plot holes, though -- Jim and John Thomas brings up some suspenseful conspiracy stuff about evil CIA agents in league with the guerillas and Russian agents. Then it... just sort of gets forgotten.<br /><br />Fortunately John McTiernan adds huge bucketfuls of suspense and gory horror along the way. Since the alien is invisible, there's the constant feeling that something horrendous and brutal is lurking in the underbrush, and there are some powerful moment like Billy's final defiant stand or Mac saying farewell to his friend.<br /><br />Arnold Schwarzenegger is... well, \\"Ahnuld\\" -- kind of wooden, very muscular, and fairly capable of the whole tough soldier thing. The other characters are sparingly but well-sketched out, such as Dutch's old buddy Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Shane Black, Sonny Landham, Carillo and Richard Chaves.

1423142667|4.0|Having explored the trouble caused by Titans and Greek gods, Riordan has apparently turned his attention to a new pantheon -- Egyptian gods. \\"The Red Pyramid\\" is overlong in places, but Riordan's first Kane Chronicles novel is a rollicking adventure/fantasy filled with ancient deities (in modern forms), fireballs, hostile magicians, and a basketball-playing baboon.<br /><br />Ever since their mother died, the Kane kids have hardly seen one another. Carter travels the world with his Egyptologist father, while Sadie lives with their maternal grandparents in London. But when their father attempts a magic spell and is captured by the god Set, Carter and Sadie are temporarily whisked away by their uncle Amos -- and then found by a mysterious magical cabal called the House of Life.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the kids soon learn two things -- Set is planning to destroy the world in just a few days, and the House has decided that they must be killed. So they're on the run with the cat goddess Bast (formerly Sadie's cat Muffin), trying to find a way to stop an ancient god of chaos from killing their father and plunging the world into horror.They'll have to venture into ancient, unspeakable dangers, and discover a side of themselves that they never knew of... but even that might not restore Ma'at.<br /><br />On the surface, \\"The Red Pyramid\\" sounds a lot like Riordan's Percy Jackson series -- you've got disaffected teenagers trying to save the world from evil gods, and finding out they have some magic powers themselves. But it actually is a rather different story (there's no safe haven for these kids!), and the interwoven Egyptian myths and magic give it a very distinct flavor of its own.<br /><br />The one problem is that the plot feels a bit stretched out, with lots of action interspersed with long stretches of inaction. But the plot is also very complex and carefully laid out, with lots of miniquests woven into the main storyline, plenty of humor (\\"How to tame the five essential elements of the universe--earth, air, water, fire, and cheese!\\"), and lots of flashy glowy magic (floating hieroglyphics, halls filled with memories, axe-headed demons, shooting fireballs, clay shabti, et cetera).<br /><br />And his characters are well-drawn to start with, and are carefully fleshed out as the story goes on -- Carter is a likable, earnest young man who obviously wishes he had a bit of normalcy, while Sadie is a snarky, sassy girl with a fragile heart. Bast is also a wonderfully quirky, catlike character (\\"That's the spirit! Now, let's have a picnic\\"), while the gloomy Anubis and mad scientist Thoth make great supporting cast.<br /><br />\\"The Red Pyramid\\" rambles on at times, but Rick Riordan's latest is still a fantastical, magical journey that paves the way for a whole new series.

0385737947|4.0|I admit it. I started this book twice and put it down. Then I decided I was either going to start and finish it or put it to the side forever. The third time truly is the charm because I became so riveted by this story that I read the book in one sitting.<br /><br />Thomas comes to on a lift and once the doors finally open, he finds himself facing a horde of boys he doesn't know in a clearing (the Glade) he doesn't recognize. He knows his own name and he occasionally has \\"almost\\" memories that don't quite form into full-blown recollections. He joins the group of boys in a small, but productive community and becomes intrigued by the runners - those boys who venture outside the looming walls when they open each morning to try to map the maze that lies beyond the border of the Glade. The boys hope that finding a path through the maze will lead them to a better life or at least to some answers as to why they are where they are. But once something happens that has never happened before - a girl is sent up in the lift for the first time - things speed up and the boys slowly realize that finding a way out is now a matter of life and death.<br /><br />Dashner has created a fascinating and heart-pounding YA thriller with just the right dystopian touches. Details are blurry, but this fits with the characters themselves - they don't know who they are or why they are there. Add in some darn creepy creatures that prowl the maze and pack a dangerous sting, and the story takes on a feverish quality. These kids have to escape, and they have to do it quickly.<br /><br />Many kudos to Dashner (and I love that a novel involving running through a maze is written by an author with \\"dash\\" in his name). I'm far outside the target demographic for this book, but I enjoyed it quite a bit, and I'll definitely order the sequel when it hits the shelves October 2010. This is a solid, fun and captivating YA novel.
B0009MDPYM|4.0|Sadly I missed out on the Hellblazer series by DC Comics under the Vertigo label when this film was first released.  Based on these great graphic novels. Constantine is about a hard-smoking & drinking guy who is not just an exorcist, but a guy who can see the Other Side.  In the film's mythology, both heaven and hell are in place with Earth.  Hell looks like L.A. during a nuclear holocaust.  So what else is new?<br /><br />Anyway, the film does have its share of plotholes which I found distracting.  These guys are scavenging around a junk yard in Mexico when a board breaks and a guy pulls out a knife wrapped in a Nazi flag and immediately becomes possessed by it.  The Sword is explained later in the film but not the Nazi connection.  How did it get there?  Did the Nazis use these artifacts?<br /><br />When our young possessed man walks, cattle fall dead at his feet which is a cool effect but not many others drop dead, just animals.  Huh?  OK, I can live with that.<br /><br />Rachael Weisz is the police detective whose twin sister dies jumping off a building.  I did note in these kinds of movies, glass breaking and lots of water ensue.  Quite interesting how the director uses these ploys to try to evoke mood and mythology.  At times it works, as with the green-eyed cat used by Constantine to check out Hell.  How Rachel's character's twin knows Constantine is never explained, either.<br /><br />Despite the insipid acting of a police detective (I mean, would you be an L.A. cop and let yourself be placed in a tub of water by a guy who lives above a bowling alley?  Yes, suspension of disbelief, but really now), the on-again-off-again Gabriel angel and the under-appreciated Shia LeBoeff, the special effects, the story and the mood went at a decent pace.  Enough to keep you interested in what happens next and the surprising but underwhelming ending.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves is his usual over-serious self, does a great conflicted character as he tries to buy his way into heaven despite the demerit suicide of his younger life.  Long story.<br /><br />My DVD had an alternate ending which was \\"OK\\" but still left me wanting.  The deleted scenes were thankfully deleted.  :P<br /><br />I'll probably pick up the Garth Ennis graphic novels first and watch this again.

0091933684|5.0|I buy a lot of cookery books, and borrow even more from the library. Most of them are getting quite interchangeable these days. Yotam Ottolenghi's new book however has nothing I've seen in other books. All the recipes are fresh and original, but not difficult or fiddly. I have spent the last few years tearing his recipes out of the Guardian at the weekend, now I don't have to. His recipes work, are full of flavour, and as I said before quite different. An excellent book even for someone who has hundreds of cookery books.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|So, rather than repeat everything that has already been said, I just want to express my opinion. First, after watching this, I'm glad I don't like beef because I definitely wouldn't after this. The food industry is another example of corrupt big business takeovers, which is pretty much in every industry. Actually, it's kind of frightening that, not only can someone patent a seed, if that plant's seed spreads into your land through natural means (you know, like the way seeds spread for millions of years before humans started playing around with them), you can still get into trouble and the burden of proof seems to be on you as the accused...so much for the constitution but we know how much that means in this day and age anyway (i.e. the Patriot Act amongst others, go ahead and check out [[ASIN:B001IX4CC0 The End of America: Director's Cut]], that's another disturbing one).<br /><br />After watching this, I almost want to just start hunting and growing my own food except that a big corporation may come in and accuse me of patent theft somehow and force me to hire some high priced lawyer to prove my innocence. All that said, this is a real eye opener and I think everyone in America should watch it.

030726839X|4.0|Max Hastings seems to put out military history at a rate of a book a month but for this WWII biography of Winston Churchill he does rise above the normal WWII histories and provide an in-depth analysis of what Churchill was able to achieve especially during the darkest days of the war when Britain stood alone. What is also admirable in my opinion is that, unlike a lot of Churchill biographies, he is willing to paint Churchill in a negative light.  Not just some quirky genius but as someone who had identifiable shortcomings which in some circumstances caused unnecessary problems and hurt England's standing among the Big 3.     If I can find one fault it is one that is common in Hasting's writing as well as in the writings of other British WWII historians. There is the idea in this work that the American's provided a mass of men and material but poor leadership. FDR is portrayed as a man of lesser intellect than Churchill and someone more naive about the Soviets. I will give Hastings his due for pointing out shortcomings in British leadership and among British troops.     This is a very interesting book and I do recommend it to any student or WWII history buff.

Gigabyte GA-790FXTA-UD5 system board idles at about 33 C with continuous use. (Had to rebuild because Antec power supply failed and burned out mobo, CPU, 2 hard drives, and DVD burner.)  Fortunately my large Antec case accommodates the Hyper 212 Plus where a smaller case might not.  Install was a little challenging, since instructions were not very clear.  The mounting pieces appear to require different configurations for different sockets and chip types.  You will need to remove the motherboard to install the backing plate unless your case provides a cutout for that purpose. Read with care and check out the videos to make certain you know how the put things together.  (Study several sources = assemble only once!)<br />Amazon beat Newegg for price on this one, and delivery was fairly prompt.

0307269752|1.0|The basic story has been reported and rehashed multiple times in previous reviews. I like nothing better than to sit down with a good mystery novel. However, this story left me blank.

I will simply state that I wholeheartedly agree with the other negative criticisms and will not be recommending this book.
6304057709|4.0|This film made me recall an article by Suzanne Fields, bemoaning the Sexual Revolution & the anniversary of Playboy Magazine: \\"cultural attitudes shifted radically. Junk sex was no better than junk food, but millions of men and women greedily devoured the empty calories....Playboy made male fantasies public and the public culture embraced those fantasies in real life. It vulgarized what most men and women in their deepest sentiments hold dear....It turned courtship away from the patient pleasures of a gourmet meal with many courses and replaced it with a cheesy burger\\"(Suzanne Fields, Yearning for a glimpse of shocking stocking, 12/15/03)

0802473156|5.0|I just finished reading the book cover to cover today. I enjoyed it so much I just purchased 5 more for family and friends. My boyfriend also volunteered to start reading it. Score! This book is full of \\"common sense\\", but it is organized and detailed so anyone can understand it, follow it, and apply it. After 2 years of dating my boyfriend, the in-love feeling was slipping away and I was starting to feel my \\"love tank\\" not quite as full even though my man is wonderful... telling me how much he loves me and how beautiful I am through out the day, helping out with dishes and laundry, buying me flowers... every woman's dream! This book explained why I wasn't feeling 100% loved, even though my boyfriend was giving 110% effort in showing his love. Its a sigh of relief to have an explanation and an action plan! I think this book could help any relationship... because real love is a choice.
0452289963|5.0|It's very revealing to see negative reviews of this book that prove at least that the reviewer actually understood Tolle's message. And you can see why those negative people don't like the book. It's not because it's repackaged Buddhism, impractical, or a repeat of wisdom available elsewhere. It's because Tolle and other \\"new thinkers\\" are issuing a direct challenge to the peculiarly American brand of selfish, arrogant, militaristic, NASCAR capitalism that views our planet as merely a playground, a plunder ground, a hunting ground, a war zone...a place we can gleefully invade, occupy, jet ski, chainsaw, poison, pave. Tolle's book gets to the spiritual causes of why opinion polls show that Americans and Obama still support expansion of offshore oil drilling, even though the entire Gulf of Mexico, its dolphins, pelicans, the entire chain of life there is likely to perish because BP, other corporations and government regulators don't care much about nature or human health- and we demand our cheap gasoline. I highly suggest that those of you who were offended by, bored with or otherwise critical of this book take a look at yourself real closely, and you will find that you don't like Tolle for the same reason you wouldn't like Jesus if he came back and preached against the love of money, against the wealthy, and against violence...preaching that got him crucified. Some people just can't handle the truth, especially when it hits close to home. The bottom line is that unless we become more quiet, introspective and ethical as Tolle suggests, we are going to destroy this planet, and ourselves.
B001HN6EF4|4.0|I bought this game for an activity during aquatic therapy. The cards are very durable and waterproof. However, they are super slippery when playing in the pool. They would be perfect for the beach or maybe in situations you are concerned they may get spilled on or if you or your kids don't mind diving to the bottom of the pool to collect cards that slipped out of your hands. I found the clip it comes with to be useless. The opening is too small and would take forever to get the cards off and on, so I just use a rubberband to loop them together.
B001HN69AY|1.0|Some will justify this picture because of the late Heath Ledger, and all the other top billing actors haphazardly thrown in the mix.  Others will rave how 'weird' it is (not realizing that weird does not equal random/pointless), and therefore how enlightened they are for appreciating an 'art film'.  How amazing the effects are.  I'll admit I was intrigued from the trailer and after hearing of Tom Waits' character.  I am just glad I waited to rent it, instead.  This was seriously, some of the most painful movie viewing I've sat through in some time.  There's movies that are so bad they are good, those categorized as cult, weird, out there, bizarro, blah blah blah... this does not fall into any of those arenas.  Aside from Waits' intermittant appearances as the devil, which were comical and fresh, the rest just stink stank stunk.  It's a classic case of less ideas, more money (aka Hollywood); and to justify weak storytelling, we'll just chuck on more CGI, more big name actors/actresses, and more plot openings, the further down the drain the story sinks.  A few scenes were well designed, and give credit to the creative work behind the carriage that unfolds into the \\"Imaginarium\\".  However, the fun stops there.  In fact, by the time one character runs up with a broken arm (we're closing in on the 2-hour mark by now), I was begging out loud, \\"oh god not another pointless side story, please don't squeeze in a 15 minute hospital scene, PLEASE NO!!!\\"... thankfully, I was spared of that much.  I've seen high school plays half as long with more talent and better storytelling.  Carnival sideshows that delivered more on the barker's promise to entertain and mystify.  This was a 2-hour empty trip to nowhere with lots of pretty colors.  To quote the movie itself, \\"I think I'd like my money back!\\"...

031606792X|5.0|How someone could say they dont like this book is beyond me! Yeah this book was alittle too happy for some people. Some people wanted to see Bella suffer through being a young vampire and maybe even kill a few humans too but not me, I was very pleased that Bella enjoyed being a vampire. I didnt want unhappy stressed out reading. This book gave you a better idea of who Jacob was as well, which was nice. My ONLY complaint about the book was that Mrs. Meyers skips over the sex part completely but yet she goes into gruesome bloody details about Bellas labor. That I didnt understand and Im hoping that the movie will not do the same. Other than that I thought the book was great, the ending had me unable to put the book down for 200 pages!! If your unsure if its worth reading I say YES its worth every second.  This is my favorite book of all times! Its like a sci-fi cinderella story for adults! I have yet to read another book with such a great ending...the last few hundred pages were a real nail biter! Im only sad that the series is over when I still feel that there is so much more to learn about the new Culen clan. I'm still hoping for a 5th book!  PS..I don't mean Midnight Sun for the 5th book, I rather Stephanie Meyers write a actual sequel to Breaking Dawn..maybe from Edwards point of view..or even Bellas still Im not sick of her yet. I know Meyers has said she doesnt want to write about vampire for a long time but do remember your faithfull fans and what they want! :)

2839905809|3.0|A wonderful piece of book art but I find it hard to get past one of the early pages that shows the \\"seven faces of business model innovation\\". This includes seven people who are called, respectively: The Senior Exec, The Intrapreneur, The Entrepreneur, The Investor, The Consultant, The Designer, The Conscientious Entrepreneur.    Anyone who is a geek--Bill Gates, for example--or a technology innovator, a researcher, a coder, a scientists would not be able to see themselves there. This is the typical unchallenged view of innovation based on science: the little rats in the white lab coats make it and then one of the above people extracts it (with all due respect to the inimitable Iqbal Quadir who represents the last category). Bull.    IF you can get past that page (and it should make you question everything in this book) there's a lot of good food for thought. Too bad it's sullied by this unchallenged stereotype of who creates real innovation in the world--and who just supplies the raw materials, so to speak.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|I saw this movie a couple of years ago, and, now that I'm old enough to have short term memory myself LOL, I decided to watch it again on a whim. I am amazed at how the film stands up. I saw nuances this viewing that I don't remember seeing in the last. Nolan is doing Inception, due out in July, and the theme sounds similar. I cannot recommend this movie enough. Eventually, you will put certain flashbacks and fast-forwards together and be stunned at the \\"real\\" story. Thumbs up!
B002VECM6S|4.0|Making schmaltzy movies is a thing Hollywood is overly good at. Music rises telling us when to get that lump in our throat. Actors talk softly with a glistening eye. And the love-fest ensues.<br /><br />If you abhor these types of films, then you might want to avoid THE BLINDSIDE. Not because all of that is in here, but because some of it is ...but only mildly. If you despise the \\"great white person saving the [insert minority here] other person from certain doom\\" theme, you might want to avoid this flick, too. Yes, some of that is in here, too. So why, oh why, did I rate this film so highly. Well, it's not overly schmaltzy nor overly great-white-hope-ish either. It is a (relatively) true telling of NFL star Michael Oher's early, troubled life in Memphis, Tennessee.<br /><br />Homeless at 16 (and without parental guidance), \\"Big Mike\\" is seen wandering the streets by the affluent Leigh Tuohy (Sandra Bullock, [[ASIN:B000HLDFK4 The Lake House]]) and her family. They do \\"the good Christian thing\\" and offer the big guy a place to sleep for the night. But as the strong, silent Michael attempts to leave the next day, Leigh decides to have him stay another night. And so goes his induction into the Tuohy family.<br /><br />But before he gets into the NFL, Michael (Quinton Aaron) must first pass high school and then get into college.

B001OQCV6K|5.0|There aren't many movies around that dare to reinvent something both literary and cinematic that is beloved by readers and movie-goers alike, but action director Guy Ritchie has dared in a big way ...and succeeded beyond my expectations.<br /><br />When Sir Arthur Conan Doyle created Sherlock Holmes ([[ASIN:1450596185 A Study in Scarlet]], 1887), he made Holmes a roughshod, drug-addled genius with keen deductive powers. This made him a person that lay-readers could identify with. A man with problems, but with unique abilities that were much in demand. Coming off the heels of the Victorian era, too, Holmes was - in a very real way - a person coming out of that stuffy time period and into the more loose and modern one. Again, something readers of the time could identify with.<br /><br />Although the books live on in perpetuity, most of the population over the age of 40 are probably more familiar with director Roy Neill's television series starring the estimable Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson (if you're under 40 you're probably hooked on the hit TV series [[ASIN:B001QE99AQ House M.D.]] which has more than just a passing familiarity with Doyle's character). Basil recreated the character of Holmes and also cleaned him up quite a bit. No drugs. Clean shaven. A real gentleman. In Doyle's literary works, however, this is far from the case ... which brings us to this new manifestation: the 2009 cinematic work starring Robert Downey Jr. ([[ASIN:B001H5X7KC Tropic Thunder]]) as Holmes and Jude Law (REPO MEN) as Watson.<br /><br />Downey Jr. is one of our great new actors. He is a chameleon in every sense of the word. Which is why I found his Holmes to be extremely well played. From his migraines to drugging Watson's beloved dog, Downey Jr. truly encompassed everything that Doyle wrote about. He's both brilliant and prone to folly; seeks a new case that's semi-interesting but is just as likely to seek out a new drug to make him feel more interested; and only has eyes for one woman, the lovely Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams, [[ASIN:B000EMGJ72 The Family Stone]]) who is just as much trouble as any drug or migraine.<br /><br />This film is, hopefully, a reawakening of the Sherlock Holmes mystique; but a reawakening with Doyle's truly flawed character and not some scrubbed clean version. The ending of this movie certainly leaves open the possibility of a sequel. Let's hope that happens.<br /><br />One final word of warning in case you didn't get what I was saying: this isn't your grandmas Sherlock Holmes. If you want Rathbone, go watch him. If you want Doyle's Holmes, check out Guy Ritchie's newest (and more accurate) interpretation.for one woman, the lovely Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams, [[ASIN:B000EMGJ72 The Family Stone]]) who is just as much trouble as any drug or migraine.

It is a necessary recording for anyone who digs jazz piano. Every number is a gem from the cool rythem of Blue Bolivar Blues to the comic keyboard cut-ups of Just A Gigolo. Thelonious Monk was a genius there is no doubt and his brilliance is showcased on this CD. If you are a jazz fan and you don't have this record and you've got the bread, buy it.

But if you can't wait the movie is definitely worth the price.
0375701427|4.0|Philip Roth is truly a unique and outstanding writer.  It is somewhat of a travesty that he has yet to win the Nobel Prize For Literature.    I was really looking forward to American Pastoral which is the first Zuckerman novel that doesn't focus primarily on Nathan Zuckerman.  It focuses on the seemingly charmed life of Seymour \\"Swede\\" Levov, a hero from Zuckerman's Newark.  This novel won the Pulitzer Prize and is considered by many to be if not Roth's greatest novel then certainly one of the greatest.    For me, there are long periods of brillance in the story.  Levov is living the American Dream.  He is a tremendous athlete, a good person and a very successful businessman.  For much of his life, he does not seem to have a misstep.  He marries Miss New Jersey and they have a wonderful daughter.      Suddenly, the American Dream goes south as Levov's daughter is not the perfect All American girl.  She turns into an overweight, angry girl with a stuttering problem.  She is very, very angry about the Viet Nam War.  Even though Swede is also against the war, she has disdain for his cozy, comfortable life.  The Levov world falls apart when the daughter, Merry, bombs a local store, killing someone and then goes underground.    Swede Levov's pain and story is wonderfully told.  Despite his daughter's crimes, he loves her and longs to save her.  He is very nostalgiac about the perfect daughter of childhood.  Despite dealing with the tragedy as well as he can, Swede never recovers.  He has always had an accomodating character and done the right and sensible thing but the pain and sorrow eat him up inside.    Swede's brother, Jerry, is a perfect contrast in that he is outspoken, goes against the grain and lives life as he feels like it.  His moments of telling Swede the way it is are very strong.    This is creative, heartwrenching and well written story of a perfect 1950s man lost and disoriented by the turmoil of the 60s.  Roth describes the 60s in a very simplistic way intentionally as this is Swede Levov's perspective.    Again, I'll restate that American Pastoral has rich themes, typical Roth humour and interesting and unusual characters and situations.    Unfortunately several Amazon customers who have given negative reviews are correct in pointing out what I think is a significant flaw.  The book really becomes tedious in points.  Roth is extremely repetitive and looks at the same events from many different perspectives.  This works for awhile but ultimately American Pastoral becomes a chore to read.    Roth is a wonderful writer and as much as it makes me feel like a Philistine, I have to say, he could have cut out 50 pages from this novel and it would have worked a lot better.    I definitely recommend it.  Even if you find it tedious, there are lots of truly wonderful moments in the novel.

True Zappa fans with 20+ CDs know that this one is different as it can NOT be found on music store shelves due to it's demand. While Zappa's Over Night Sensation CD brought him to the forefront of the general public, Hot Rats CD cemented Zappa as a certified master musician. Two tracks stand above the others: Willie the Pimp and The Gumbo Variations are incomparable. Visualize Frank Zappa, Captain Beefheart, Sugar Cane Harris, Jean Luc Ponty, and every other musical superstar thats dreamed of jamming with Zappa at least once, combining efforts together and putting out at 200% in a 17+ minute jam session. It is on this CD. If you have only two CDs in your music collection this should be one of them!

0380820846|1.0|I couldn't do it! I couldn't finish this one. How disappointing!!! I, like others, enjoyed the three books prior to this one. However, this one was just dumb...and for a romance novel that's saying a lot! They're all silly but some just make you wonder why you read this stuff until you pick a good one up or go back an reread a great one and remind yourself.     Where to start.     1)Colin doesn't even closely resemble the cute and clever guy he is in the other books. He was whiny, one dimensional and totally shallow! Reading his thoughts (the few of them there were) was like reading a silly teenage girl's journal (yes I meant girl not boy). He would get giddy over a compliment from Penelope ...the same girl he swore he wouldn't marry and only danced with out of pity? Mind you there was nothing to lead up to his feeling this way. He would fish for compliments from her as if he wasn't already super popular! I couldn't help wondering...is this the same guy from the other books? He really didn't seem like it at all! He would get angry for literally no reason and for the smallest stuff ever and then run to apologize to Penelope for it as soon as he could. In short he came off as an imposter...maybe all the sun he got in Cyprus fried his brain.    2)2) Penelope was probably the worst part. I like reading about the not-so-pretty, not-so-smooth girl who comes into her own and lands a hot guy romances but she just didn't do it for me. She was pretty spineless and very boring! Also she is supposed to be twenty-eight and she still comes off like a sixteen year old with her gushy thoughts about Mr. oh-so-perfect-in-every-way Colin. This girl has loved him for twelve years without so much as a chance at him. Quite the opposite since she overheard him saying there was no way he'd ever marry HER. You would think she would be more mature about it over a decade later and love him like a woman and not a love sick puppy. Now, don't get me wrong, I get that she's supposed to be \\"shy\\" and what not but it wasn't believable...at all! The perk about the shy girl sotires is that you get to really know her through her thoughts and connect, sympathize, or understand and thus grow to like her. Unfortunately ...she really didn't have any thoughts that were interesting! Not just for other people in the book but for the reader. We, as readers, get to see inside the characters ( or so we should) but we don't get any of that. There's nothing ...especially for someone who suddenly (out of the blue and for no reason I could read back and find) is hiding a big secret. No wonder this girl isn't popular! There really isn't anything going on in her head for us to read about. Her thoughts are as dull as her personality. Which leads me to...   3)Penelope is very sensitive about her lack of popularity and looks. She is made fun of by other people and even her own mother. She is also hurt by Colin's inability to notice her and even a little hurt by the Bridgerton family's \\"pity\\" for her as she sees it. Lastly she is hurt by the comments made about her in Lady Whisltedowns gossip column about her horrible dresses...which leads me to the biggest insult this book hurled at my brain and that was (SPOILER INCOMING) that supposedly SHE is Lady Whistledowns!! So she insults herself and others in her gossip column but we NEVER get to see those oh so clever thoughts as we read this book. Mind you this whole time she is a central character in a challenge to unmask who Lady Whistledowns is and we never even get to see a nervous or humorous thought on her part about what she thinks. She, like others, seems just as clueless. I didn't buy the romance brewing between her and Colin and I sure as hell didn't believe that she was Lady Whistledowns anymore than Lady Danbury believed that Cressida Twombley was Lady Whistedowns. There was NOTHING that would lead the reader to believe that she might even possibly believe she's the famous gossip columnist hiding in the midst of the ton. She's been doing this for twelve years and there was nothing to indicate it until the author suddenly pulled it out of ...nowhere. Colin simply happen to see her on the street and followed her and found out it was her and I was left wondering ...did I miss a chapter or ten when I turned the page. This is when I stopped reading.  I love some of Julia Quinn's books (What Happens In London being one of my favorites) but this book ...ugh.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|This is a great story that will stir your emotions. Duvall and Jones pull off the performances of a lifetime. Diane Lane and the rest of the actors also do a wonderful job. Do yourself a favor and dedicate your entire Saturday to watching this movie.
0393061310|5.0|The colonial dominance of Europeans has been deeply ingrained in the social and political fabrics of human history.  With their guns, germs, and steel, these northerners decimated anyone who stood in their path for gold, god, and glory.  So why were the Europeans so powerful?  Why wasn't it the Asians or Africans who colonized the world instead?  For centuries, scholars believed it was because of biology; that is the Europeans were simply a superior race.  However, social scientist Jared Diamond believes it was Europe's advantageous geography that ultimately led them to supremacy, and he set out to validate this thesis in his Pulitzer winning masterpiece, \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel.\\"  Diamond's fundamental theory is that because the Eurasian Fertile Crescent allowed Europeans to grow a surplus of food, the population was able to focus on other aspects of living.  With food no longer the center of all activity, Europeans were able to establish social stratification, political bureaucracy, division of labor, and technology.  This explains why they had far superior weaponry, organization, and knowledge compared to their enemies.  Moreover, because Europe had exposure to a larger variety of animals, the people were able to develop an evolutionary resistance to their diseases over time.  As a result, when Europeans came in contact with outsiders (i.e. Amerindians), they wrecked havoc with pestilence.  \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" is a monumental contribution to the social sciences.  Diamond's literature completely changed our view of human history and made us contemplate the colossal effects geography might have had on the fates of societies.  It is a book that everyone needs to read.
B002VECMAE|3.0|quite slow.  A silly concept that drags on a bit.  More of a Jeff Bridges movie than a George Clooney movie.
B002GJU54E|4.0|So I have been reading this series for years now. I wasn't sure when I started, but I got hooked. This book is definitely not the best - most of the in-between novellas aren't, but it's part of the series. Did I laugh? Yep! I was in tears at one point because I was at work and trying not to laugh out loud. yes - some of the book was way out there and a little repetitive, but I have learned to expect that. And with the time gap between the books, sometimes i need the memory jog. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and hope you do too!
B001OQCV6A|5.0|May seem unorthodox, but many characteristics of Holmes are supported by the books.  Interesting relationship between Holmes and Watson, which is the key to a movie like this.  The remake of Wild WIld West ruined such a relationship and that movie was a dud.    Only real fault is overuse of CGI near the end.  The set designs and filming is quite good.

B002VECM6S|4.0|Sports movies are abundant these days, and so, with many dealing with overcoming obstacles, it is inevitable that some fall into a line of clichés. As much as The Blind Side might appear to be a \\"football movie,\\" it really is more about life--that is, what it means to change it. In The Blind Side, Michael Oher's story is magnificently depicted. The film is still guilty some stereotypes and some corniness, but I don't think these moments are enough to detract from Michael Oher's story being told in a genuine way. We feel some sympathy for the young man, and some compassion for the woman and the family responsible for helping him to a new place in life. Oher, despite a difficult and dysfunctional upbringing, is able to work his way into the pro sports world thanks to Leigh Anne Tuohy and her supportive family.     The Blind Side does have some clichés, which we usually experience in \\"race\\" or \\"sports\\" films, and is a victim of uncomfortable sappiness at points. For instance, we have the obligatory obnoxious, racist Southern redneck father and son from the opposing team that Big Mike plays against, who act the part to perfection. We also have the \\"white guilt\\" references, and the overwhelming pity for the poor kid who has no chance. Inspiring at times, The Blind Side falls into some moments of cheesiness, such as the scene where Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) talks trash to some guys in the hood. Also, she decides she can be a better coach than the football coach, so she interrupts a practice to help the coach out and tell Mike how to block.     Still, it is a film that has redeeming qualities which outweigh the negatives. We pull for Michael when he is struggling with his grades and fitting in to a new school and family. Leigh Anne Tuohy becomes the force that won't let him quit; she doesn't want him just to be another statistic, and makes sure that his dream will be fulfilled. This becomes a feel good story because Michael is a likeable kid who doesn't have allthe advantages others do, but does something with the chances he's given.     Sandra Bullock winning Best Actress for her role as Leigh Anne Tuohy seemed a bit of a stretch and probably shows how subjective judging a star's performance really is. Overall, though, I'd say The Blind Side was a better than average film which does a sold job telling an inspirational story, but probably not worthy of a five star rating.
B002VPE1AW|1.0|A comic book of a movie.  Comic book vivid in color and comic book imaginative.  Those are the positives.  But the film is also comic book shallow in plotting, character development, and dialogue.  It's comic book simplistic thematically and, most significantly, comic book brutal.  Imagine Rambo and a band of like-minded mercenaries invading an Asia Shangri-La with the intention of raping that Eden environmentally and you'll have some idea of the plot.  After setting up successful strip-mining and clear-cutting operations (to continue the analogy), the grunts' time is otherwise spent in machine-gunning peasant farmers, their water buffalo and their elephants from gunships while blowing up temples with the intention of dispiriting the locals.  Hardly entertaining.  The movie ends in a long battle piece wherein the environment-loving peasantry in a mindless frontal attack (with elephants, monkeys, and eagles joining in upon realizing what is at stake) throws muscle and bone and arrows and spears against a mechanized, but lightly armed expeditionary force.  The military stupidity of the attack somehow overwhelms the military stupidity of the mercenaries, and so the mercenaries are expelled from Shangri-La in what must be one of the most hollow victories recorded on film.  While winning the skirmish, the people and wildlife of this now-heavily-damaged paradise succeed only in demonstrating how fragile and defenseless their situation is.   The words of the Terminator echo in the mind as the film ends: \\"I'll be back.\\"  Back with some serious weaponry next time, and it won't be pretty.  I can't say whether I hated this film more than No Country for Old Men from a few years back, but if not it was close.  Perhaps because there are parts of Avatar that were so enjoyable, the wanton carnage is the more painful.  I was ready for both to end an hour before the ending came.  To buy this DVD would suggest an intention to view it twice.  That I can't imagine.
B000059T1E|4.0|This album contains two tracks that I just love: \\"Glad\\" and \\"Freedom Rider.\\"  Just the sound of these tracks makes me feel good.  I find the lyrics of the track titled \\"John Barleycorn\\" annoying and gruesome, and musically, it's not interesting to me.  The other tracks are okay.  So I recommend that you do what I did: download those two tracks, and enjoy!  At $.99 apiece, you'll get them both for less than a cup of coffee at Starbucks, and you'll enjoy them forever.
0307454541|5.0|Before I started reading Stieg Larson's infamous Millennium series \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" I started with its second book the \\"The Girl that played with Fire\\" upon reading the first 50 pages I was so captivated with the novels main protagonists Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomvkist that I stopped reading the book and decided to read the first novel and I am extremely happy with my choice. \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is an excellent work of literature where the author pens the dramatic events of the Vangar Tragedy and brilliantly introduces Lisbeth and Mikael two characters with different ideas and behaviors. Mikael Blomkvist instantly charms the reader with his wit, brilliance, and of course prowess with the ladies. Lisbeth Salander on the other hand is a social misfit and can best described as brilliant computer hacker with a terrible taste in music and wardrobe. Although she mostly associates herself with punk/goth friends she is like a stray cat never allowing people to close to her life. During the course of the book both characters are forced to work together to solve the mystery disappearance of sixteen year old Harriet Vangar who was last seen at a family gathering 30 years ago. During the course of the novel other tragic events shape Blomkvist and Salander's lives which eventually sets up the plot for the next two books in the series. I am not a fan of crime/mystery or financial novels however Larsson does a great job in incorporating all theses facets without making the story dull. I urge all new readers to read the book it will take time but after you have read the book once read it again and you will appreciate the beauty that this story is and the new tales that will are told in the next set of books of this series.

B002VPE1B6|3.0|Avatar on blue-ray is very good visually, But I do feel a little cheated. I tried to cancel this order but was too late as they had already readied it for shipping.  It turns out that Cameron is re-releasing Avatar this Summer and is releasing a \\"director's cut\\" with out-takes and a digital copy this November.  If you want to see this NOW then by all means, get this disk. It is a very good DVD with a crisp transfer and great sound.  But I do feel that I should have waited, I will buy the next release to get the extra's. It's kinda like when they release Jackson's King Kong and the 3 months later, released a directors cut with many more extra's.  How much mining of my wallet can they expect to get away with?  Quite a bit it would seem.
B002RT69QQ|5.0|I purchased this reader with a combination of Kingston's SDHC card. I do not agree with that the memory card reader is a flimsy junk. It is plastic, so don't expect it last if you roll over with your car. It is not worse than a USB flash drive which is made of plastic (since most of them are). If you are a person who doesn't know how to take care of things, it will probably not last long. Just like you would not toss around your digital camera, this item meant to serve as a card reader and not a football, a frisbee, or a toy for your dog.    The card reader has a little blue light at the top and is blinking when data is being read. I find the reader great help, so I don't have to keep connect the cable to my camera, just pop the card out and read away. It supports different cards which is also great, but I only use it with SDHC cards.    You can pull out the little doors/protectors or whatever else you might wanna call it, both at the front and on the back, which will protect the USB connector and the card as well. This way you can easily leave a card in there while transporting it and it will be protected.    It is a great multi card reader for a few bucks.
0385523386|4.0|One cannot spend time in a federal prison and come out the same person you were when you went in. The key is to let the experience teach you valuable life lessons about yourself and humanity. This book gives us just such an experience, focusing on the positive aspects of a hard journey. While prison itself is a nightmare, it's the people that make it bearable. Piper's experiences are realistic, moving and often humourous. Many memories came back to me while reading this book, among them  the maxipad dusters, the stand up counts, the drinks in a plastic bag and the canteen that was constanty out of things you crave. But most of all I remember discovering the spark that existed in most of the woman that made them human...not inhuman numbers. Getting tough on crime is a political agenda not a policy meant to help societies most vulnerable. Piper's reintegration classes typify the amount of effort put into treating drug addiction and mental health, the main issues at the root of all crimes, and is a sad statement of how the system fails to prepare inmates for a life outside, basically setting them up to fail. A wonderful book...thank you Piper...you nailed it!
193413712X|3.0|I am not really sure how I feel about a book that has won the 2010 Pulitzer Prize, is only 191 pages long, but took me almost (2) weeks to finish it.  Such was the case for Paul Harding's prize winner: Tinkers.<br /><br />I thought this novel it was a combination of beautiful and flowery writing, with a boring memory based story.  For me, no matter how great the writing is, if the story doesn't work, it is tough to finish the book.<br /><br />Briefly, Tinkers, is a story of three generations of New England men. We learn about them basically through the memories of a dying man.  George Washington Crosby spent his days repairing clocks, but now as he lies confines to his hospital deathbed, surrounded by clocks, dying of cancer and renal failure. He has nothing but \\"time\\" to reflect on the past.  As George prepares to be joined once again with his father Howard, who predeceased him, he reflects on what he remembers of his father's life. Howard was a Tinker, who traveled door to door selling his wares, up and down the coast of Maine.  His life was one of poverty, and, in addition,  he suffered from epilepsy. Since little was understood about epilepsy in the early 19th century, his wife thought he was mentally ill. When Howard learned that his wife was planning to have him institutionalized, he decided to abandon his family.  (Yes, there is a little more, but blah, blah, blah).<br /><br />As a New Englander, I loved the imagery of the 19th century New England landscape. I thought the cover art was perfect for this cold, bleak novel set in Maine. The story line, or lack of a working plot just did not work for me. I thought the metaphor of time and life, just tick, tick, ticking away was, in my opinion, enough to depress even the most cheerful readers.  Had it not been that this book had won the Pulitzer Prize, I think I might have abandoned it early on.  I think this is one of those books that lovers of literary fiction will need to try for themselves and decide.
B0035V35PI|5.0|Judging from the low score on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB, the negative buzz around this film when it came out, and Hollywood's generally bad track record with all films Asian (ahem...

Ninja Assassin is ninjaly goodness!<br /><br />Be warned, however, that it's not for everybody. If you don't like ninjas, violence, and fast-paced action sequences, please stop reading and look for another film. Brought to you by the same people who gave us the Matrix and [[ASIN:B000PC0U1W V for Vendetta]] (producers Joel Silver & The Wachowski Brothers; director James McTeigue), this is one stylish film. It's hyper-kinetic, super-slick, and ultra-violent. The action scenes come fast and they come often. There's probably never more than 5 minutes of just dialogue or calm. If you're squeamish, definitely look for another film. Every battle scene is drenched in blood and littered with body parts. People get sliced in half, heads roll, and limbs go flying all over the place like confetti. It's a bloody, disgusting mess! And it's brilliant. People die in gruesome, graphic ways like in [[ASIN:B001GCUO52 The Final Destination [Blu-ray]]]. I caught myself wincing at some of the gore.<br /><br />Raizo, the main protagonist (played by Korean pop star Rain), is a member of a secretive mercenary ninja clan who through the centuries have carried out assassinations. He is a protege. As orphans, he and his clan siblings have been raised from childhood to be ruthless killing machines, emotionless, unseen, and impervious to pain. However, he has a good heart, and when tasked with executing a ninja for desertion, he betrays his master and is now hunted by his clan. The main theme in this film is obedience to one's duty vs. obedience to one's heart. There's also a minor thread of ninja sibling rivalry (like the terrible [[ASIN:B002NXSRX4 G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra [Blu-ray]]]). The story is simple and well-trodden, but it's effectively and entertainingly presented, spaced out over time and sandwiched between the action sequences so there is never a lull for too long. Parts of the film reminded me of [[ASIN:B002O5M4SA L&eacute;on: The Professional]] because of Raizo's unstoppable badness and protector role. Also worth noting is commanding screen presence of Ben Miles, who plays one of the Europol agents.<br /><br />Visually, the film is spectacular and the action sequences are fantastically over the top. Raizon's primary weapon is the kusarigama, a lethal swinging chain of pain. Parts of the film definitely look like a video game, especially the [[ASIN:B0029MAXR2 Ninja Gaiden]] series, due to the weapons similarities, copious decapitations/amputations, and even the ninja fight inside a burning dojo. The finale against his master is a boss fight, and the way it's filmed pays tribute to the samurai movie genre. I also spotted a bit of [[ASIN:B001RTCP10 Chronicles of Riddick]] during this sequence. You'll know what I mean when you see it.<br /><br />This film wasn't meant for a general audience, so I understand how it got killed at the box office. If you're into ultra-stylish violence and beautiful fight choreography, Ninja Assassin is right as Rain.here's also a minor thread of ninja sibling rivalry (like the terrible [[ASIN:B002NXSRX4 G.I.

B002G1YPH0|4.0|Pros:   1) Price (under $28 when bought but today under $27).  2) Noise is acceptable (I also got CM922's 3 big fans + eVGA 9800GT fan).    Cons:  1) Too much work for upgrade, OK if you build new but installation required you to take the whole system apart.  2) Size. It's not extra big, but taller than OCZ OCZTVEND Vendetta that I owned (BTW I got it on-sale $7.50! after rebate). Bearly made it with MSI 890GXM-G65 microATX MB - the FAN is VERY close to the RAM. That's another reason I prefer ATX MB.    Stock heat sink: 26C idle, 52C while runnng Prime95 (AMD Phenom x 4 955 BE stock 3.2 GHz). If no OC I think stick with stock HS should be OK!  CM Hyper 212+: 24 - 26C idle (room temp maybe higher today), 44C whle running Prime95 (OC to 3.6 GHZ)  The result is acceptable base on the fact all cores are 100% loaded. I'm looking for 37 - 38C so got bit disappointed.    IMO many after market CPU coolers are overpriced. I got the CPU (955BE) for about $100 (MSI MB combo deal) so not willing to spend $50 - 60 just for the cooler. Same theory there is no way to spend $200K - 250K to remodel a $400K house.  I'm a long time AMD CPU user. Although this is my first time to use AMD stock heatsink, I can tell just by see to justify the quality (and that's why I never used stock heatsink before this).  The 955BE's stock heatsink is defintely better than any previous version of other models but AMD should do better. BE version CPU desreve more, why AMD expect people buy their Black Edition CPU but discourage them to overclock is still a joke to me. (Discourage = warranty get void and bundle with so-so stock heat sink) Luckily Subaru didn't void my warranty after I took my WRX over 130 mph.   AMD product's price/performance is better than Intel, I just hope their marketing people is smarter.
0452295548|3.0|I had high hopes for this book. I found it interesting that a brain scientist would share her tale of a stroke and live to tell it. While the book was informative and put into perspective a lot things we should consider, it was very repetitive. I glossed over several passages.<br /><br />It is profound that her mother tended to her every need. I wish I could have someone so gifted in my life to understand me. Dr. Taylor was truly blessed to have a wonderful caretaker.<br /><br />I enjoyed her recollection of the stroke and how she went through the process. Those chapters are worth reading in case you find yourself in that situation or someone you know. It is also helpful to read how stroke victims should be treated. However, I was hoping to read more about her journey after the stroke. The surgery chapter was brief. I wanted to know how it was done, what they found, etc. vs. a few pages about it being scheduled and over in a matter of paragraphs.<br /><br />Recovery was also described in a few pages. I felt this stage was also important to note however the author chose to ignore that and focus instead on the spiritual journey she found herself on. If you're going to write a book for us to learn more about strokes, you should encompass all aspects.<br /><br />In the end, there is still a lot of be learned from this book but most of the ending can be skipped post recovery.
B002HRTMHQ|5.0|Sorry Teach but what had happened was that it was an accident on the highway and uh...the dog ate my homework...and I tried to scan the homework but for some reason the server was down....      Talk about being late?  Man..... who IS this guy?!?!?    I literally had never heard of Mayer Hawthorne until a few months back or so when the legendary Erykah Badu tweeted she wanted to do songs with him.  I still dismissed it because I was too lazy to google him (sad yes I know) and I thought it was just a screen name for John Mayer.  Fast forward to a couple weeks ago I was somewhere and heard the song \\"Just Aint Gonna Work Out\\" and man was it jammin!  Long story short, googled him, youtubed him, and finally got the album.      One thing is for sure, the man has the soul and an easily recognizable voice.  While there have been many \\"Blue Eyed Soul\\" artists to come along in the past decade or so (including but not limited to Robin Thicke, Justin Timberlake, Remy Shand, John Mayer, Jon B) this album is better than any album I've heard from them.  Each song is different yet feels right in place on the album.  The content and lyrics are poignant and refreshing.  The instrumentation and production is highly skilled, soulful, and has the groove.  The man (and the band) are extremely talented and creative.  Even his videos are unique.    I Don't think there is anything corny about Mayer Hawthorne's Strange Arrangement.  This is AUTHENTIC...THE REAL DEAL.  This is one of the best debuts I've heard in a while and the music has made me a fan.  If you like soul & R&B music then I guarantee this album won't disappoint.  Strange Arrangement is a classic record with classic songs on it.  Five Stars and my stamp of approval!  A must buy.

A total groove of a CD, program out the down moments and shake your bad-thang to the rest of it.....4 stars

0307454541|4.0|I liked this book, but thought it was a bit slow to start.  However, once I got going I had trouble putting it down.  Larsson writes an interesting book and knows how to keep you turning pages.  There are a few of plots going here and there are some interesting twists.  The first plot has to do with Blomkvist's libel case and the other deals with Vanger's niece.  The second is by far the more interesting and leads me to believe that the first was merely Larsson's way to \\"free up\\" Blomkvist to investigate Harriet's disappearance.  In the end, he has to wrap it up to keep Millenium alive for the next novel.  I thought that was drawn out a bit.<br /><br />The third plot, and one I was very interested in knowing more about, has to do with Salander's story.  I am also curious if she has Asperger's Syndrome as he alludes in the book, or if she is just socially inept due to the abuse and misfortunes she suffered at a young age.  Unfortunately, he didn't go into her story much in this book and the way he wraps up her story left me unsatisfied.  Hopefully he will clear it up in the other books.<br /><br />I like a book that is able to surprise me; so was disappointed that this was fairly predictable with regards to Harriet, the killer(s), and the Gottfried's death.  I am not that smart, so get pretty frustrated when I can figure things out early on.  Maybe I read too many crime novels and watch too many crime shows.  :)<br /><br />There is a bit too much violence against women in the book for my taste.  Actually, there is some pretty sick stuff and it put me off a bit.  I'm not overly squeamish, I just felt that some of the things were a bit unnecessary.<br /><br />Also, some (maybe most) of the characters are a bit flat.  I couldn't figure out why women were so ready to sleep with Blomkvist.  He seemed a little weak to me.  Obviously he was smart (maybe not, he does make a couple of stupid decisions that almost get him killed) and had principles, but a bit emotionally stunted.  Salander was by far the most interesting character.<br /><br />Others complain about the amazing things Salander could do (those same people probably think Tom Cruise is great in MI), but that didn't bother me so much.  I believe that there are people smart enough to be able to hack into systems and do some pretty wild stuff, so...  I just rolled with it.  Seriously, it's a book and the author was having some fun.<br /><br />Anyway, overall a good read, but I wasn't as impressed as I expected.ost interesting character.

0756655307|3.0|For Amazon's price this book is a no brainer for any collector or someone interested in learning more about Marvel. However, I was disappointed upon its arrival. Being a longtime reader I found the information far too basic. Nearly the same amount of coverage is listed for insignificant, peripheral characters as it is with classic heroes and villains. This is especially true regarding the 'powers' section. The artwork is good and its number of entries expansive but again, just not enough depth.
B001HN69AY|1.0|This is just a waste of time.  The plot is not enough to waste 2 hours of your life.  The acting is for naught an if you buy it for any other reason you will be disappointed.  Donate the money to a worthy cause.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|I previously watched Cat's renting a DVD from Netflix and quality was so-so. This DVD has bright colors, it is not black and white as previous was, I can literally see faces in little details and quality is very good. Very pleased!
B000002UCN|3.0|Even though this only contains six--six!!!--solo Harrisongs from 1970-1976 (excluding Top 40 hits \\"This Song\\" and \\"Ding Dong; Ding Dong\\" as well as B-sides \\"Isn't It a Pity\\" and \\"Deep Blue\\"), three of these six are missing from the long-awaited \\"Let It Roll\\" collection.      I understand the continued exclusion of \\"This Song\\", which addresses an unjustified blemish on George Harrison's career (the ruling that \\"My Sweet Lord\\" stole from the Chiffons' \\"He's So Fine\\" for those who didn't know); and \\"Ding Dong; Ding Dong\\" was a lightweight single released for New Year's 1975.  But all those singles, which cost a mint to collect on 45, would be nice to have in one place.    Since \\"Let It Roll\\" is also missing \\"You\\", \\"Dark Horse\\", and (most surprisingly) \\"Bangla-Desh\\", plus plenty of the '76-'89 singles, it's far from comprehensive.  For me, the combination of this and the out-of-print \\"Dark Horse Years\\" remains the way to own the bulk of The Quiet Beatle's material.  This is so even though I hate having a CD for only six songs (like everyone else who owns this, I have the Beatles tracks on the group's CDs).  Oh, and the packaging is an insult to God and man.  No lyrics, no liner notes, unthrilling cover art.  Plus, on my copy at least, the number 8 before \\"My Sweet Lord\\" on the back cover is missing.)  Yeesh.
B002OT731E|1.0|The one reason - THE ONLY 'ONE' REASON - for owning this CD is for the \\"novelty\\" number, Dylan's \\"Like A Rolling Stone.\\"  I have already remarked millions of times before that the Stones should have scooped up Mick Ronson after Mick Taylor quit, but, for reasons yet discernable, they chose Ron Wood instead, blah-blah-blah...But the one unmitigated, astoundingly unforgivable, irredeemible \\"final nail in the coffin\\" was/is Chuck Leavell.  It is absolutely a travesty that, for some inexplicible reason, Mick, Keef, Charlie & Co (who, beginning life as \\"The Rolling Stones,\\" had the late, great genius of Ian Stewart as pianist) chose this...\\"molly hatchett reject\\" for their \\"keyboard player/'musical director'...\\"  And for those of us who taught ourselves guitar and/or bass, jamming along with \\"Spider & The Fly\\" off \\"Out Of Our Heads\\": the  abominably \\"stripped\\" version of that gem-of-a-song on this...thing will honestly make you cringe and wonder, \\"Is this really the same song?\\"  And the answer will, of course, be a resounding \\"NO!\\"
B000002SE0|4.0|I'm sorry to say that this recording gets the silver to Sutherland/Pavarotti's gold. Why? Sound not as good as the splendid sound on Sutherland's. Mehta's conducting is more lush and effective than the cautious and measured but excellent Mollanari-Pradelli. Now to the principals. Nillson sounds like she could execute a suitor with her knife edged voice alone which does show a little strain and effort here and there particularly in In Questa Reggia. Sutherland sings with more legato effortlessly. She always made it sound as easy as breathing but of course she never had to cut through immense Wagnerian or Straussian orchestras like Nillson. I expected Renata Scotto to outclass Caballe but Scotto is on the verge of screaming in the climactic measures of Signore ascolta where Caballe is as smooth as melting ice cream. Love them both. Both Corelli and Scotto indulge in a bit of traditional 1950's style singing, a bit too many grace notes if ever so small linking one note to the next which I find annoying though plenty of people wouldn't and some excessive emoting, well within acceptable traditional parameters for most people. Corelli sings both Non Piangere Liu and Nessun Dorma very well but it's not pretty when he gets to the high note on which Domingo famously cracks on the dvd. The sound on Nillson's earlier recording with Bjoerling is so bad don't waste your money. So we get to Pavarotti whom I compared to Olympic Snow Boarder Shawn White jumping 5 feet higher than anyone else competing. Pavarotti is just that much better than everyone else, a very pure sound produced,never a hint of effort or strain, everything just right, apparently a great challenge to equal let alone surpass. I strongly urge you to get the dvd with Domingo, a great show and a Palace scene that looks like it cost $30 Million to stage.

He said it was \\"mysterious\\" and suspenseful and that kept him turning the pages until the very end.  My 12-year old daughter also loved the book.  They're both looking forward to the next book in the series...maybe [[ASIN:0385738757 The Scorch Trials]] is it?<br /><br />Just because my son likes the book doesn't mean your child will.  For reference, he also loves the Rick Riordan's \\"Percy Jackson and the Olympians\\"...he says those are his favorite books.  He's re-read the series several times.  He's currently re-reading [[ASIN:0812550706 Ender's Game (Ender, Book 1)]].<br /><br />I've looked at some of the other reviews of this book and I've seen the critiques...not very deep, poor characters.  Ok, the book might not be for adults, but it's a hit with its target audience.  My son and daughter found it entertaining and it engaged their imaginations.  Reading is fun, and if a book shows them that then it gets my approval too!
B0035WTE2U|1.0|Well, I'm one of the biggest AC/DC fans ever..But it looks like they are taking something from the Rolling Stones playbook; just keep reissuing the same songs over and over like a broken record.   I use to believe the band had intergrity; offically there is no greatest hits package on record,so to speak, unlike the Rolling Stones who issue a package after every studio/live album.   Want something new? Try \\"Back Tracks\\" if you're a real fan.   Again you have to buy 3 CD's in order to get the one with material you've never heard before.   Now if there was a new CD with fresh songs..I'd buy it in a second.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|In every way Rent is a perfect work of art; tremendously enjoyable as entertainment and emotionally satisfying. Cinematically it's masterful, true to life, and wonderfully well cast and acted. Impeccable singing, powerful music, witty and brilliant lyrics combine intricately to deliver an exciting and transcendent experience.<br /><br />Rent is the universal story of creative and artistic misfits trying to make it in the big city. It's a tale as old as civilization, which gives it added punch and turns the film into a wellspring of inspiration. It's a modern retelling of La Boheme, the classic French story, but is original in almost every way. The characters are fascinating, the music sounds new, and the vision of New York City looks and feels fresh as well.<br /><br />It's a 'must see' for everyone who enjoys the mating of music, great storytelling, and powerful characters. The companion disc 2 (included) is terrific in its own right, and tells the background story of the creation of Rent; first as off-off Broadway theater; then through many versions over the years as a monster hit that toured the globe.
0971407614|4.0|As a fitness buff, I thoroughly enjoyed reading Lauren's book.  It's chockfull of great exercises, almost all of which involve no resistance other than one's own bodyweight.  Bodyweight purists may balk since there are occasions when Lauren recommends using filled backpacks, telephone books, cans of soup, or jugs of water as homemade weights.   Usually these recommendations are made to those who want to up the ante on particular exercises.  Personally I take no issue with that, but I would prefer to use free weights simply because I like to know exactly how much weight I'm adding.       The number one issue I had with You Are Your Own Gym has been resolved.  Lauren makes repeated reference to his website, [...].  For the first couple of weeks after publication, the website was not  up, leading to some frustration.  However, it is now up and running and, while it is not as detailed as I was hoping, it is a great place to go for additional information.  Additionally, if you want more information about what the book covers, the website is a great introduction.       The second issue I take with YAYOG is Lauren's insistence that interval strength training is the only exercise one needs and that aerobic exercise \\"is inefficient and ineffective no matter what your goal.\\" (p. 12)   I have a hard time believing that one can build endurance and increase cardiovascular health with interval strength training alone.  The Centers for Disease Control recommend a combination of aerobic exercise and strength training to improve and maintain overall health.    Obviously, if one is involved in a particular sport, whether karate or tennis, one needs to practice that activity so that the motions common to the sport become reflexive.   Lauren himself admits as much.  But one also wants to build endurance, expanding cardio-pulmonary capacity.  That is why cross-training is so important.    That's why super-athlete Bruce Lee didn't simply practice roundhouse kicks and uppercuts.  He ran,did strength-training, and perfected his Jeet Kune Do moves and philosophy.          Lauren makes much of the fact that \\"marathon runners will huff and puff if they cycle for the first time in years,\\" because they are using muscles in cycling that they never use in running.  His point is that, with his interval strength training system, one uses far more muscles and is better able to adapt to different activities.  Agreed, but that doesn't mean one will automatically have the endurance to maintain those varied activities.  Following Lauren's schedule, one is exercising only 30 minutes or so per day, 4-5 days per week.  Again, to build endurance one is better off combining strength-training with as many other varied activities as one is comfortable to build cardio-pulmonary health and capacity and endurance across the board.    The CDC recommends 2 ½ hours of moderately intense aerobic activity per week in addition to  strength training at least twice a week for optimal health.       For the first week I had the book, I was convinced it had no index, necessitating mad flips through the book, from appendices to exercises.  There is an index, but for some reason it is located on p. 55 just before the exercises rather than at the end of the book.  Perhaps in the next edition, the index could be moved.   Another upgrade the publisher might consider in the next edition is spiral- or comb-binding.  Not only do such bindings make exercise books much easier to use, but they also prolong the life of the book.    Mine is already showing signs of falling apart simply because of how much I am using it.       It is clear that, while YAYOG is billed as being for both men and women, Lauren's intended audience is men.  He makes reference on several occasions to using \\"your wife or girlfriend\\" as a human weight.   To be fair, as a 110 pound woman, I would not follow his advice, were he to give it, to use my 180 pound husband as a human weight.   And (again, to be fair) some of the pictures show the exercises being done by a woman.       My final complaint about the book has to do with the fact that the party responsible for proofing the text was clearly a computer.  On three different pages, three times apiece on two pages, Lauren talks about \\"loosing\\" weight.  On another page he advises the reader \\"to brake off a stick.\\"  Lauren deserved a human proofer to catch these spelling errors and to correct some minor grammatical flaws (such as, referring to food as being \\"healthy\\" rather than \\"healthful\\").         Having said all that, Lauren's material is terrific and some of it quite inventive.  He describes each exercise thoroughly and the photographs are helpful.  He also does a great job in explaining why one should \\"switch-up\\" strength training techniques and how to go about doing so.   The workouts in the appendices are well-planned and provide excellent examples for developing one's own workouts.  The wide variety of exercises provided with the variations and recommendations on how to kick it up a notch mean that the possibilities are limited only by one's imagination.    I know I will find myself referring to YAYOG over and over from now on.         Lauren also explains very simply the basics of nutrition.  I have read some complaints from others that they wish he'd gone into greater detail on that score.  The website does have more information, but, frankly, given the wild variances in individual caloric needs, budgets, and tastes, it would have taken another 100 pages or so for Lauren to do a thorough job of laying out an adjustable nutrition plan.  The reader is better off taking Lauren's basics, using the RMR calculator to determine individual caloric needs, and creating her own plan.   The most important concept to walk away with in terms of nutrition is that one should regard Lauren's advice not as a diet but as a way of life.  Stick with lean protein, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and fresh fruits and vegetables, and water.          Lauren developed these exercises and plans as a trainer for the Unites States Special Operations forces.  Part of the proceeds of the book go to the Special Operations Warrior Foundation to help the families of special ops personnel who are killed or wounded in action or in training.  Not only does Lauren know his stuff, but he believes in helping his own.  You have to respect that.

081297381X|5.0|In the second edition of Black Swan, Nassim appended a postscript, entitled     On Robustness and Fragility, Deeper Philosophical and Empirical Reflections    , which I've read through once, so far.  Further re-readings will be needed, to do justice to the material.  Meantime, there was an interesting chapter - Why I Do All This Walking, or How Systems Become Fragile - which in some ways sounded like George Carlin's You are All Diseased skit.  That's the skit where Carlin explains that our immune system needs unstructured practice as opposed to over-protection, and that his own physiology became more robust by early swims in the Hudson river (in 'raw sewage').    (20100917 - if the read is looking for further comments about the addendum, I'll try to place it in the comments section.  Unfortunately, Amazon allows only one review per customer)    In this chapter, Nassim outlines his personal exercise program, which he believes improved his fitness level better than the types of programs prescribed by fitness experts.  More than most authors, I trust Nassim's intellectual honesty; but in this case, the word 'placebo' should pop up into the reader's mind.  His explanations for the connections between his fitness and his activites sound plausible enough, but not totally convincing.  However, because this is Nassim we are talking about, we could justifiably try out his suggestions, but hedge the bet by staying in touch with your doctor.      Also in the Robustness and Fragility postscript, especially in the final chapters, Taleb attempts to offer the reader practical applications of his long study of Black Swans.  Aside from his explicit recommendations, below are some of the lessons/heuristics which you might conclude from reading and reflecting on Nassim's books Fooled by Randomness and The Black Swan.  They are not necessarily what the author intended, nor necessarily what he would agree with, but hopefully will encourage the reader to stop by the bookstore or order itfrom Amazon.com, and derive whatever value they can.  The paperback edition is very affordable.    Lessons learned from Fooled by Randomness and The Black Swan:    Life is inherently unpredictable.  Nobody can predict the future, reliably.    We think we know more, than we actually do.    If 10 of your predictions come out right, chalk them up to lucky guesses.  Most likely, that will be the 11th time you were right.    Don't be put off by a writer's apparent narcissism.  You might learn something, if you pay attention to the content.    Events which resemble illustrations of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, are everywhere.  These daily life events might be a different animal altogether than an unprovable theorem, but the common element is that they are unpredictable and unexplainable - at least until after the fact.    There are some reasons to hope for the best, in terms of our future technologically, but absolutely no reason to expect specific details or a specific sequence of technological milestones.  We may well achieve some of the transhumanist dreams, but when e.g. super-intelligence arrives, it will be most likely be an accidental discovery.  There are a few reasons to hope for positive Black Swans, but many reasons to fear and to be cautious.    Be careful about repeating the phrase 'Black Swan' too often.  If you want keep saying 'Black Swan' in order to sound contrarian and wise, fine.  Works for me, and others.  But at least try to show the author the respect of applying the term 'Black Swan' appropriately.  Not all surprising events are Black Swans.  The term 'Black Swans' applies to unexpected events which have considerable impact, and which are easily explained/justified/rationalized after their occurrence.    Always question the traditional wisdom.    Evolution doesn't have the complete picture  One of the things which has always bothered me about evolutionary explanation, is that particular traits are developed 'in order to' achieve some end, 'in order to' to avoid some predator, etc.  While the evolutionists may correctly claim that their statements are shorthand for more chancy processes, the connotation sounds a lot like intelligent design, and it gives evolutionary explanation an air of predictability which is undeserved.  Nassim doesn't touch on this specific topic in Black Swan, but does cast some doubt on certain types of evolutionary claims, e.g. regarding evolutionary 'fitness'      Perhaps the most important lesson, which has been available throughout history, if you look for it -   If you want to try something that others think is silly, go ahead and do it.  A business idea which they say won't work; an art form which they say is a waste of time; any type of skill you wish to acquire, which they insist will never be marketable or popular; a style of writing, which any sane publisher would laugh at and turn away from - go ahead and enjoy doing it.  Nobody knows how things will work out, and neither do you.    This last lesson will probably be further confirmed by Taleb's next book, which apparently is about the value of tinkering.  In a different realm, it sounds like what Stephen Wolfram calls 'searching the computational universe', in order to locate programs which might be useful to humans.            The Black Swan is not a smooth read, but definitely has the potential to alter your perspective about life, and about current events in particular.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|I know some people might not agree with me but I found avatar at times boring. I actually nodded and my brother had to poke me to wake up. But that's not why I rate this movie three stars the movie is beautiful don't get me wrong but the storyline was nothing new. It was like the watching the white people taking the indians land which we all know happend see nothing new. Everyone told me how could this movie was so I went to see it I though the dialouge was cheesy for one I mean the army dude(name I can't rember.)he said something about juju beans and I'm like what? This is so cheesy. I'm a total scifi-fantasy junky and this just didn't appeal to me I guess I shouldn't have expected more and expected less.<br />Ups-<br />*The movie was beautiful<br />*The acting was excellent<br />*The action was alright<br />*Glad I didn't pay for my ticket<br /><br />Down-<br />*Cheesy dialouge<br />*Storyline lacked<br />*The ending wasn't much of a shocker<br />*The movie takes forever to get into and its way too long
B000056HOZ|4.0|I really like having all of the videos that Bruce Springsteen made during his \\"heyday\\" which, arguably, he's still experiencing.  However, the 5.1 mixes of the songs are very disappointing.  I think that, for some of the clips, the post-production crew merely threw some reverb to the back surround speakers and that was the extent of it.  Also, why is the legendary Phoenix, AZ performance of \\"Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)\\" edited, thus excluding the band introductions?  That section is one of the coolest moments in a video loaded with them.  There was plenty of room on the DVD, so the complete clip could easily have been included.<br /><br />The second disc, for me, is too \\"sad,\\" if that makes any sense.  There are so many heavy, dramatic songs that by the end of the DVD, I needed to listen to Katrina and the Waves just to get my mood back up.  Usually, I feel the exact opposite after watching anything having to do with Bruce Springsteen, but not after watching this disc.  I felt like weeping.<br /><br />Overall, one can't deny the quality of the material, but I think it could've been put together in a more balanced and effective fashion.
030745455X|4.0|I liked the book.  It moved a little quicker than the first one (...dragon tatoo).  The book starts with Lisbeth in the Caribbean, but that doesn't really tie into the rest of the story.  Maybe that part will make sense when I read the third book.
B0002ADY0Q|5.0|This title never ever really sounded good. I have a first edition vinyl LP I bought back in the day and the title track is unlistenable due to a very muddy mix. I thought the first LP was recorded and mixed much better. When the first CD version of this title was released I was happy that the mix seemed more open and the album was improved but it still had a thin trebly feel to it. This deluxe version fixes all the previous problems. While it does contain the original mixes, the remastering allows each instrument (including all that brass) to really shine. The sound is full and resonant and has some real \\"butt\\" to it. Adding a slew of unreleased or alternate tracks and a wonderful booklet full of the story behind the recording makes this a must have for the Heep head.
0385342039|5.0|This was by far my favorite Sophie Kinsella book. Dont get me wrong, I love them all(with the exception of Remember Me) but this one was far above the others. What I think set it apart is that it was unique. Yes, it was similar to other of her books. Girl doesn't know what to do with life, has disfunctional family, has bad past relationships, meets new perfect guy, uncovers some kind of secret, everything is happy in the end. ect, however Sadie's character makes it a little more fresh. I thought that she and Lara were a great pair, and it made me sad in the end at what happened, even though it was happy. I have read this book three times already, and everytime it seems like I am reading a new book. I absoultely love this book!
B00129H7VS|5.0|Had this DVD series, upgraded to Blu-ray.  If you are at all a WWII buff, or just want to get a feel for what these men went through, you must see this series.
B001NLKT60|5.0|this book delves into lisabeth's past with a plot that keeps you guessing until the end....was unable to put the book down until it was over...can't wait for the final book to come out because they leave you hanging at the end of this one.
0743298039|4.0|An unusual book, but a good read. It has many plot twists in the story which keep the reader engaged. You really don't know until the end how it all turns out. You really don't know the exact time period or location of the story. It's a great read for a book club because it initiates a lot of discussion.
B002VECM6S|5.0|After we saw it here at home, I have already loaned it out several times.  GREAT story.
1878424319|4.0|I brought the book for extra credit for a class and was hesitant to read it at first. I was surprise to find it useful and educational. I started applying these four agreements to my daily life and found it to be true. It was hard to change, but I took it step by step and found that I started being more positive about my future. My job and studies started to improve and don't get in as much trouble as I use to. I see why the professor wanted us to read the book and I want others to read it. Another must read for another truly profound and life changing book is The Self Love Principle by Debra Gangale.
B002JCSWV6|4.0|INVICTUS is one of those inspiring sports dramas that can very easily make you gag.  The fact that this film does NOT trigger your gag reflex (at least, not until close to the end) is a testament to Eastwood's poignant direction, and the rock-solid performances of the film's two leads.<br /><br />The film chronicles Nelson Mandela's plight to unite the blacks and whites of post-apartheid South Africa.  His weapon of choice?  Rugby.  Mandela decides to take one of the nation's most hated teams (its colors have often been associated with racism), and rally support for his newly-freed country.  His (somewhat unknowing) conspirator in the scheme is Francois Pienaar, star player for the Springboks.<br /><br />Freeman shines at Mandela, and Damon gives an understated performance as Pienaar.  They help anchor the script, penned by SHERLOCK HOLMES-scribe Anthony Peckham.  The script seems to want to take a journey deep into the heart of sentimentality, but Eastwood restrains himself.  He makes full use of the soaring music we've come to expect in these films, and the dramatic shots; this is far from Eastwood's best direction, as he seems to give in to genre expectations, instead of defy them (as he did so boldly in UNFORGIVEN).  Yet, he never caves completely, and the film comes off without that sentimental aftertaste this genre usually leaves behind.  The film itself is beautifully shot, with some engaging rugby scenes.  Indeed, Freeman and Damon may have gotten the Oscar-nods (deservedly so), but the game itself is the star of the film, at times even overshadowing the politics.  Which lends the film to some bitter scrutiny, of course; but INVICTUS is so well-made and put together, you really have a hard time criticizing it as a movie.  It's best to view it as a sports film, one which happens to have some political implications; and indeed, it stands as one of the better entries in that genre.
1594488843|4.0|Motivation 1.0: survival; Motivation 2.0 (industrial): carrots and sticks (compensation); Motivation 3.0: autonomy, mastery, higher purpose.<br /><br />Dan Pink argues that the era of \\"Motivation 2.0\\" is an outdated and an ineffective model, which may have worked in the 20th century when the focus was on squeezing efficiency from the factory floor, but is no longer relevant to the \\"modern & creative\\" world where most of the factory jobs have moved overseas. \\"Motivation 3.0\\" is the pursuit of autonomy, mastery, and higher purpose.<br /><br />If you're in a leadership position, it is definitely a book you should read. Having said that, the author is selective in the case studies he highlights, so keep a critical eye for counter-examples.
B002ZG98VO|2.0|I give this one out of two stars for the gorgeous visuals, and the other star for Oscar Isaac's performance. Both managed to save this movie from getting a 0/5.<br /><br />But today I went to go see the movie, especially after months of hype; it was directed by Ridley Scott and had Russell Crowe, and it was the long awaited Robin Hood. When I saw the ad with on the Superbowl, I got all hyped up and excited. It looked like it was going to be an awesome reimagining of an epic.<br /><br />Instead... we got basically a very derivative and boring movie about some emo dude named Robin Hood. That's basically about it.<br /><br />First off, WHERE IS ROBIN HOOD??? Robin Hood should be fun, adventurous, he's basically the James Bond of the 12th century. Prince of Thieves did a way better job at portraying the character. Instead we get a whiny and angsty emo guy named Robin Hood who grumbles his way through the movie.<br /><br />Second, there's way too much going on. There's at least 30 different story lines, like... well, the king dies, the new King John has been appointed the throne, Robin has managed to flee back to England, the French are planning an invasion, etc. Yawn. There's so much going that it's hard to keep track of what goes on. Too many subplots, too many characters, etc.<br /><br />Also, the movie is very derivative. Let's see: Where did the landing on the beach towards the end as well as the battle come from? Oh that's right! Saving Private Ryan. Where did all those pre-battle \\"speeches\\" come from? Oh that's right! Braveheart. Where did the so-called Robin come from? Oh that's right! Gladiator! Huzzah for recycling!!! Cause after all, movies are environmentally friendly too!<br /><br />The action scenes were very poorly done. It seems like Scott went to the team: \\"Oh yeah, so ya know. Shake the camera, splash water everywhere, throw some fake blood everywhere, have people jump around clanging their swords, and stuff like that.\\" \\"Cool, nobody can see what's going on!\\"<br /><br />Most importantly, the movie was just plain... too long. I have indeed seen longer movies but seriously, this is just long. At least 30 minutes should be trimmed. There are tons of scenes that don't have anything to do with the plot and even more importantly, too many subplots and characters, half of which could be cut, and the end, the movie is just forgettable to the point where you won't even remember how the movie opens.<br /><br />In short, this movie was an utter disaster on Scott's part, and was in general, frustrating to watch. I still can't get over how frustrating it was.plain... too long. I have indeed seen longer movies but seriously, this is just long. At least 30 minutes should be trimmed.

B000008B01|5.0|The performance of Joao Gilberto with the recording presence of the album is the one the best I have ever heard.  It's brilliant.
B000PTYP5C|3.0|Okay, I'm not huge into this album, but there are three must have songs on it.  If nothing else, buy those three on iTunes or something.  \\"Forsaken,\\" \\"Constant Motion,\\" and \\"Dark Eternal Night.\\"  Even though I didn't really bond with the other songs on the album, the DVD that comes with the deluxe edition is hella cool and I really enjoyed watching the guys at work in the studio.      I won't whine about the past, because I was a hardcore DT fan for Images and Awake.  After Infinity, which I could not, and still cannot, get into, I didn't listen to them for a long time. I am a huge Kevin worshipper, but I have accepted that Kevin won't be back, and I'm a huge Jordan fan too. Bottom line, don't buy the whole CD if you're not completely hardcore, dedicated DT fan status.  It's about as simple as that.
B000P6YNSE|3.0|3.5 stars.  I never followed this series in broadcast and finally, with the final few episodes left to air, I finally broke down and started watching it on DVD. This show more than deserves its addictive yet similtaneously frustrating reputation. Featuring some of the best acting ever on television by a remarkable and constantly rotating ensemble cast, it also has its share of moments that inspire sheer incredulity. Frankly, if this were just a tale of castaways on a normal tropical island without the mystical/scientific overtones, I'd probably like it even better, since paranormal has never been my bag. But I hang on for the moments that are anchored in something resembling reality and our stellar cast does not disappoint. Hands down my favorite season to date, I have a feeling that the subsequent three seasons might find it hard to match this level. And I have settled on my favorite castaways out of our overstuffed cast: sexy conman/cowboy with an unexpected bookworm side, Sawyer (Josh Holloway, he of the roguish dimples) and tortured Cassandra, Desmond, (Henry Ian Cusick, yet another sexy Scottish export). The always excellent Michael Emerson as the diabolical (or is he?) Ben Linus has given the show a much-needed shot in the arm since his introduction last season and provides a counterpoint energy to our original castaways, some of whom have become rather tedious through familiarity.  We also get to meet beguiling Other, Juliet (Elizabeth Mitchell) who is playing both sides now--which side will finally come down on?  Particularly strong episodes this go-round are \\"The Man From Tallahassee\\", in which we find out how Locke came to be in that wheelchair; \\"The Brig\\", in which Sawyer comes face-to-face with his nemesis, the original \\"Sawyer\\", and discovers a bond with Locke that neither knew existed; and \\"The Man Behind the Curtain\\", which explores the origin and backstory of Ben Linus, and how he came to be the leader of the Others.  During the two-part finale, \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" we say goodbye permanently to one of our castaways and I'm equally sad to say goodbye to Season Three because I don't know how they are going to top it.  All indications are that they can't, and they don't succeed.  However, because this series is video crack and I can't stop watching, I have duly started Season Four.  Once you get \\"Lost\\" you have no choice but to keep going.  One thing's for sure: we ain't seen nothin' yet--it's only going to get weirder and weirder from here on out.

B002RL7W9W|5.0|My 4 year old built the whole setup in about 20 minutes.  It quickly got taken apart and incorporated into the rest of his collection. This was his first Star Wars piece, and he enjoys mixing up the helmets and body parts with his other figures.  The price is reasonable for a set with four characters.

B001IF252M|5.0|I recently upgraded to a MacBook Pro and needed a VGA adapter. This little device has worked very nicely!
B001QWBM62|5.0|This recorder works great for recording rough or scrub takes. The stero mics are excellent and the overall controls are simple and easy to use. Downloading to the PC DAW is USB and also works great (just like any USB drive). The 4 channel also works good so your I can record 2 channels from my ToneBone acoustic pre amp and 2 from the stero mics.  Also works great for home recording as you can capture your foundation acoustic takes in other rooms without dragging all your big mics and recording gear there. The metronome feature is also great for recording the first acoustic foundation tracks in any room.  I've got a larger PC recording system with several good condensor mics, but this little device is an awesome addtion even if you just use it to sort out ideas..

1416972242|5.0|If you are a sucker for a parallel universe story, you will love this. Creative, romantic, humorous, well written. One caveat: There is one plot twist that may seem \\"too twisted\\" in too wierd a way, but not to worry-Know that you will be okay with it. KEEP reading! I LOVED this book.
B0035WTE2U|1.0|perhaps someday they will actually release the soundtrack from the movie, which if listened to on the official website is great, not this AC/DC cd.
B001B7CNXI|4.0|Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx are the best actors out there but I think they did a respectable job of catching the essence. Colin's changing accent was a bit of a nuisance.  Michael Mann's directing ability, vision and eye for detail though are bar not. The level of realism is amazing.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Movie is one that is for the ages, just like Cameron's other success movie \\"Titanic\\". Can't wait until a sequel comes out.
1401219268|5.0|This is one of the big three. &quot;Watchmen&quot;, &quot;Maus&quot; and &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; changed the way we look at comics. There are already many reviews of this book and mine will live in the forest, but this book is truly monumental. Much, much more than just another superhero yarn, it raises questions of the dreadful implications of nuclear warfare and placing our lives in the hands of a select few, be it the shaky hand of autocratic president Richard Nixon or a being who has the power of destroying our species with just a thought. Many unforgettable characters populate this book: the uncompromising vigilante Rorschach, the dire truth seeker Comedian, the omnipotent Dr. Manhattan, the virtuous Nite Owl, the brilliant Ozymandius. The term &quot;must read&quot; is used too often but this book truly is just that and the only graphic novel to be included in Time Magazine's greatest novels list. The corner of your bookshelf reserved for the best of the best is incomplete without it.
B001V9LPWQ|1.0|This one went right to my pile of discarded movies. I expected some decent picture quality associated with blu-ray, but was sorely disappointed. The movie itself is extremely boring and lame. Would those who raved about it please buy it back from me?

0805087184|5.0|Bill Martin Jr's singsong writing coupled with Eric Carle's simplistic artwork, makes Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? a must have for any household that has small children.  The rhythmic verse \\"Red Bird, Red Bird, What do you see? I see a yellow duck looking at me.\\" together with vibrantly colored illustrations definitely promotes memorable story time moments with your child reading and falling in love with all of the characters: some traditionally colored like Yellow Duck or Green Frog and others not so traditional like Purple Cat or Blue Horse.<br /><br />This beloved classic of forty years (and still going) has captured the hearts of many young and old.  My children love it, as will any child introduced to Brown Bear and his friends.
B002QW7ALM|3.0|I know most people will want to compare this film to Alien, but truth be told, 'Alien' isn't the first film to feature an alien stowaway on board a spaceship. Yes!' Alien' is basically a remake of 'It The Terror From Beyond Space' from the 50's, so if we want to beat down a film for not being original, then lets stop right there.<br /><br />'Pandorum' is a pretty good sci -fi thriller with its share of good scares and atmosphere. It also has two fine actors(Quaid and Foster)on screen for most of it's hour and forty minute running time. Once the film gets going the Alien comparison will lessen as this film turns into a little more than monster of the loose fare.<br /><br />The biggest flaw for me with this film is that I found parts of it confusing towards the end and I wasn't quite sure what was really happening and what was happening in the minds of these space travelers. The film is well paced and even though the aliens are strange looking, they work for the most part. If you're a fan of sci-fi monster films, then this might be worth a look.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This bbc production of \\"North and South\\" is wonderful.  I feel that I am taken to another time and place.  It is romantic, yet it is not a light fluffy romance.  This mini series shows the family relationship of two vastly different families, their struggles and their love for each other.  Richard Armitage is \\"darkly handsome and sexy\\".  I can't wait to finish it tonight.    I would not have purchased this dvd had I not read the reviews first on the amazon discussion boards.  Thanks amazon!
B000UBMWG4|5.0|I'm placing this review here to inform everyone considering this purchase, that Disc 1 marked Final Cut is still actually the workprint version of the film.  How long does it take to get this problem straightened out?  Amazon.com had earlier removed this item from their shelves because of this problem and when they finally brought it back, I ordered it, figuring the problem had been resolved.  Well, it hasn't. I hope the phone number, listed in another review for Warner Brothers service hotline, (1-800-553-6937) still works cause I'm hopping on the phone to get mine replaced.<br />UPDATE:  I made the call to Warner Brothers and in less than 5 minutes, they took my information and said the disc will be on it's way in about a week.  In a little over a week, I received the proper disc and I am presently watching it with a smile on my face.  I give kudos here to Warner Brothers for taking care of this with very little trouble.  My rating now goes from 1 to 5
0971407614|4.0|The amusing spelling and imprecise science cost this book a star.  But I bought the book for some quick and practical ideas to stay in shape while on the road.  In that regard the book succeeds in a big way.  It is a quick, inspiring and fun read and provides exercise routines that will test your body no matter what your level of fitness.   I suppose there are similar books out there, but this is the one that has worked for me.   I would recommend it to anyone who wants to integrate fitness into their lifestyle without shelling out for gym memberships or equipment.
B000F6IOBQ|2.0|This movie falls short of the original and is plainly a horrible sequel. Without the enigmatic Lucien, the charismatic Viktor, and the sinister Kraven, the plot falls short and is boring. When those characters died, the story died as did the incredible acting. Bill Nighy (Viktor) and Michael Sheen (Lucien) were what made the first movie and are both highly talented actors. Scott Speedman (Michael) is a boring character and a mediocre actor. I did not feel the chemistry between him and Selene in this movie just like I didn't see it in the first movie.<br /><br />There was nothing interesting going on with the raunchy sex scenes and the whole Corvinus family storyline with Marcus and William. BORING.<br /><br />I only give it 2 stars because of some scenes from the past featuring my favorite character Viktor in it. Other than that, it's a 1 star movie and not really worth seeing.
B002ZG98J6|4.0|This show was an excellent thrill ride. I have a six year old son and I dread going to the movies with him because normally the shows are cartoons or just horribly boring. This show kept my attention and was actually enjoyable. I really like the cameos from Rosario Dawson and Uma Thurman. If your going to write a review on the movie, then do that. Stop comparing the movies to the books, it's not fair. The Directos have to figure out what to put into a movie that will make people want to spend the money to go see a movie and pay for popcorn and pop (Yes I said pop).
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is the best novel I have read in the last year.  I highly recommend it.
B002ZG98VE|5.0|This movie is an excellent rendition of Robin Hood. Russell Crowe is excellent as his usual rugged, stoic, tough guy image. The story line is quite different yet shows a truer picture of 12th century existence. When comparing this to previous iterations of the story, keep in mind the time period/ story of this movie predates more familiar versions.      When this movie is released on DVD it will take its place alongside other Russell Crowe classics that have become favorites: Gladiator and Master & Commander. Robin Hood sits comfortably alongside those classics as films well worth watching.
B000GPIPSS|5.0|Excellent movie.  The box design and graphics are fantastic.  If you want the movie, this is the way to get it.
0743297334|3.0|All this book is about is a bunch of jobless(the narator does have  job) losers who do nothing but go to bars get drunk and go to bull fights. It even does not have a proper ending i guess the characters don't change and continue to waste time not working and drinking.  This is the second Hemingway book i read the first was the bloated From Who the Bell Tows which i really did not like all to much but i deciede to give him another shot with this one because it is shorter and is considered his best. I guess i really don't get him i much rather read another book by his friend F. Scott Fitzgerald who drunk most of the time could write circles around Hemingway.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I am a fan of True Blood and was a fan of the Twilight series before they were ruined by the movies, but I am always apprehensive to start watching/reading new vampire stories because of how many there are now a days. I really had no interest in this show since it is on a network I generally don't watch and thought it was just a teen drama. My cousin begged me to give it a chance and I was hooked. I caught up on all the episodes I missed out on within a few days and religiously watched it every thursday... and for me that is saying alot because I usually just watch shows online or dvd after they air. The acting is superb in this show, and everyone in the cast is believable and nice to look at! While the show does follow a group of highscool students, there really is a much more mature and adult vibe to the show in an appropriate way. This show will leave you wanting more and more after every episode and dying to see what comes next. Trust me, give it a shot.  Also, I saw someone read the books during a break from the show, which I also did... This is one of the first times I can honestly say that the show/movie is better than the original novel! The show is soo much better than the books (don't read them before you see the show) the writers and casting crew get two thumbs up![[ASIN:B002JVWR9U The Vampire Diaries: The Complete First Season]]
1594202249|3.0|As with any Pynchon novel, enjoyment can be found in his cultural references, use of language, general intellectual horsepower... and what I'll term the \\"unbridled hoppy-ness\\" that is quintissential, at times capricious TP -- rather than emotional attachment to character or story.<br /><br />Not that there isn't story or character to be found. Both are there, in Sam Spades, but Pynchon, as always, is to his unique style over any emotional gravitas, beholden, and because I'm kept at arms length, even though I'm marveling and laughing at a genius's side project, I simply can't give it a higher rating.<br /><br />It would be nice to see the man leave his comfort zone. I can only see just so many flawless triple axles at the Olympics before I'm dying to see even one messy quad.

B002OFWG7O|5.0|It has been established that this greatest hits package is less from the band than the record company. The usual obligatory thing that sometimes happens when a band gets popular fast.<br /><br />So, perhaps, to call this the Foo Fighters' Greatest Hits right now, may seem a bit premature as Dave Grohl and Company no doubt have years of greatness left in them. But there is no question that the tracks included are favorites. There are hits from the self-titled debut CD to The Colour and the Shape, for instance, including All My Life, Best of You, My Hero, and my personal favorite, Everlong, among many more songs.<br /><br />Add in that the deluxe edition also includes a bonus DVD of the Foo Fighters' videos for many of the CD tracks - and some curiously missing from the CD, i.e. Walking After You, and it seems to be a fairly comprehensive set, and that is not even mentioning the live tracks also included on the DVD for Everlong, Breakout, Skin and Bones, and All My Life.<br /><br />Now, being honest, if you have all of the Foo Fighters CDs, there is really not a lot new here. It's not a necessity to own this. But if you want the videos and live tracks, it may be worth buying for the DVD alone, and to have all the popular tracks on the CD on one disk for convenience. And, also, if just for the ending track on the CD of a fantastic acoustic version of Everlong, a bonus in my eyes right there.<br /><br />It is also a great introductory piece for anyone new to the Foo Fighters, too.<br /><br />Either way, it is a worthy collection of the greatness of the Foo Fighters, for the avid fan or new fan. Thank God rock is not completely dead. If anyone doubts it, play this as proof.
B002ZG997M|1.0|The digital projection in the theatre made this movie, shot in the dark, unwatchable. A mess of logic, belief and genre. What a waste.
B002ZG97RY|4.0|This is an edge of your seat thriller, Damon plays Chief warrant officer Roy Miller, tasked in finding WMDs in Iraq, where his superiors give him Intel and he then follows and executes said orders, but the thing is, every site he goes to there are no WMDs... so what is going on? His only ally is CIA guy Martin Brown (Brendan Gleeson), who knows Middle Eastern Affairs better than anyone who always seems to be butting heads with Clark Poundstone (Greg Kinnear), and a reporter who wants the facts, the truth, (Amy Ryan), Pentagon weasel Clark Poundstone has a source code named Magellan, who is telling Poundstone of these alleged WMD sights, but Miller's Team is always turning up nothing. Then it seems Miller's task is to bring in an Iraqi General who may hold the key to what is going on before Poundstone does using a Special Ops Unit at his disposal. The Special Ops Unit is led by Jason Isaacs, a nice small/ cameo role (where the viewer recognizes him but can't quit put a finger on who he is, but definitely seen him in other movies--- played the baddie in The Patriot) His task is to silence Miller following orders from Poundstone.  Poundstone's big picture is political, show the people abroad what they want to hear and see... Gaining a Foot hold and winning the war on Terror, where as it's not that easy for the soldiers on the ground actually doing the real work like Miller and his Team.<br /><br />Paul Greengrass gives us a movie that touches on this hot topic of the Iraqi War. Where baddies aren't just Insurgents, where good/bad is blurred, obviously I think Kinnear could be deemed the \\"bad guy\\"--- or likes to think he's just doing his job, going into a country thinking to himself it's for the good but ultimately invading a country for all the wrong reasons (sorry to bring in my own beliefs) That's what makes this movie so great. Greengrass portrays the Iraqis with a voice that ultimately once U.S Soldiers pull out it is up to them to forge a new country. There is a nice scene where Miller comes out of the streets into a posh Palace where reporters/ CIA/ top officials are staying, he's all sweaty, dirty, and he looks around and sees a BBQ, sees blond women in the pool, guys in polos lounging, drinking beer, as if Miller just stepped into the Twilight Zone, wanting answers why his sites are turning up empty. These people don't realize what is going on outside these walls.<br /><br />Damon plays Miller as the usual in control, steady, soldier, wanting the real answers, the facts, no matter how dirty, or right or wrong the answer may be, he just doesn't want to go around Baghdad blind where everything is in the Grey. He really does want to know is there a purpose on why we are here, where I remember a member of Miller's team states, \\"The facts don't matter we're here to do a job that's all\\"-- it was something to that affect and Miller replies, \\"It matters to me.\\" sums up the whole movie right there.<br /><br />And with any Paul Greengrass movie, we have to have the final show down with shaky camera and all, but as always as tired as it may be, the chase sequence is thrilling, almost heart-stopping.... this is a well made thriller, no matter what your views are on the current situation, check this out. Ridley Scott's Body of Lies would be a nice companion piece to watch back to back.ne where Miller comes out of the streets into a posh Palace where reporters/ CIA/ top officials are staying, he's all sweaty, dirty, and he looks around and sees a BBQ, sees blond women in the pool, guys in polos lounging, drinking beer, as if Miller just stepped into the Twilight Zone, wanting answers why his sites are turning up empty.

0446563048|5.0|'m a big fan of Zappos and the things that the company has been able to do. I love the idea of a culture driven company and Zappos has been the poster child for this idea for quite some time.<br /><br />When I saw this book, I knew I had to read it.<br /><br />The first section of the book covers a great deal of time (birth to Tony's start as Zappos' CEO).<br /><br />Tony provides provides a pretty interesting, and at times funny, walk-through of his childhood, high school and college.  While describing his life, its easy to see the entrepreneurial spirit alive and kicking throughout Tony's life.<br /><br />One of the really interesting parts of this section is the description of the building of Tony's first company LinkExchange (LE) and the subsequent selling of that company to Microsoft.  The building and sale of LinkExchange isn't chronicled in detail but an interesting summary is provided the gives the reader a good feel for what happened.<br /><br />In addition, Tony describes the years after the LE sale and his search for something to do.  In this part of the book, Tony details the lessons he learned playing poker...and tries to equate them to strategies for business...and he does a pretty decent job of it too.<br /><br />About half-way through the book (starting with Section II) Tony gets into the details of how Zappos became the company it is today.  The trials & tribulations of an internet company trying to survive the bursting of the dot.com bubble, the economic troubles of the early 2000's and other issues (9/11, etc).<br /><br />This part of the book is pretty interesting as Tony gives the reader some insight into how Zappos was kept afloat during the initial few years.  Basically, if it weren't for Tony putting his own money into the company (and almost going broke doing so) Zappos might not have survived.<br /><br />While describing how Zappos was built into a thriving business, Tony also provides some insight into his approach to building the Zappos culture that we've all become aware of.  There are some great tidbits of knowledge in this section of the book.<br /><br />While I found the first two sections of the book (described above) interesting, the final section of the  book is where the real lessons can be learned about building a culture that fits an organization.<br /><br />In the final section of the book, Tony describes the concept of Delivering Happiness.  This section is very interesting and worth reading a few times (which I'm doing).<br /><br />This book is a winner.<br /><br />I like this book for a few reasons.  First, its just an interesting read.  Being able to hear about Tony's life from Tony is interesting to me.  Second....it provides some excellent insight into what its really like running a startup and the ups/downs that comes with the territory.<br /><br />Will you like it?  I think so...but here's some advice for those of you who are on the fence about the book:<br /><br />If you have any interest in building a business, read this book.<br />If you have any interest in a building a culture that `fits' your organization, read this book.<br />If you like reading about success stories in business, read this book.<br />If you are a grammar nerd and hate it when people don't write in perfect grammatical english, you may not like this book.

B0018QCXH8|5.0|Imagine \\"Citizen Kane\\" with petroleum replacing newspapers, and you have a pretty good idea of what \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is about. Whether it's a great film is debatable. But there's no question it's an absolute knockout -- for its acting, cinematography, and music.<br /><br />\\"There Will Be Blood\\" is another in Hollywood's long line of left-wing \\"I hate American society\\" films. I love such movies (we need them now more than ever), especially when they attack fundamental American values such as greed, hypocrisy, materialism, and shallow religiosity. This one strikes with a Panzer division and cruise missiles.<br /><br />The meaning of the title is not altogether clear. I interpret it as the second part of the statement \\"Whenever a great deal of money is involved, there will be blood.\\" Take it as you like.<br /><br />Though Daniel Day-Lewis's performance has been widely praised, it is, to some degree, one-note \\"Spock\\" acting with little variation in tone. Worse, he sounds as if he's channeling Jack Palance. (Other people hear John Huston.) And when Paul Dano (in an otherwise fine performance) goes into a squeally fit, he sounds like Gene Wilder groveling in front of Zero Mostel. It's surprising the director failed to catch and fix these problems, which grow increasingly irritating.<br /><br />The cinematography is not irritating. \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is one of the best-photographed color films I've ever seen. I particularly like the way detail is retained in bright backgrounds, without burning them out. The music score is also exceptional, totally \\"wrong\\", yet absolutely perfect, even the use of a terrible performance of the Brahms violin concerto (Sophe-Mutter + HvK).<br /><br />One obvious question might be... Given the subject matter, is \\"There Will Be Blood\\" as good as \\"Citizen Kane\\"? Nope, because the latter is (surprisingly) a far more audacious film. And Welles had the genius to add the \\"Rosebud\\" riddle, which keeps the audience interested.<br /><br />Given the highly positive critical response to \\"There Will Be Blood\\", you should read a review from a right-wing critic who not only detested the film, but utterly missed its obvious (and to be fair, heavy-handed) points. Amazon doesn't permit URLs, but go to the Wikipedia article for the film and click on footnote 31, to read Armond White's review.<br /><br />\\"There Will Be Blood\\" would barely rank a PG rating, if it weren't for a brutal (though not particularly graphic) murder near the end. Whether it's enough to justify an R, I don't know. But it's the kind of film teenagers /ought/ to see (especially those belonging to Young Republicans), so parents shouldn't hesitate to let them watch.<br /><br />The Blu-ray transfer is magnificent, of almost-demo quality.Will Be Blood\\", you should read a review from a right-wing critic who not only detested the film, but utterly missed its obvious (and to be fair, heavy-handed) points.

1601251505|5.0|This is basically D&D 3.75, as they went in and tweaked everything and fixed some broken things.  This is a great version of D&D for those of us who are not all that happy with 4th ed.  My group is running Pathfinder for all of our games, and we're even transferring our current modules to it.  This is a must have for D&D players!
B000W93CXQ|4.0|I gave this book four stars because I thought the storyline was really compelling. It is written from the point of view of TWO different first person characters, which at some points, made it difficult to understand whose perspective we were seeing but all in all, I think the book was a great purchase. It is definitely worth the $9.99 that I paid because it really made me think.

B002VPE1AW|5.0|One of the BEST film creations of all times!! I first saw this film in IMAX-3D, Incredible!!!!! Real Life animation combined with Real Life people the way I've never seen before.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|It was so exciting and yet so mysterious. I can hardly wait to see Avatar II. There is going to be another, Isn't there? Has to be!!!

B002VPE1B6|5.0|Absolutely a great buy. This is a movie my family will watch over and over. Blu-ray makes it feel like you're seeing it in the theater!
B00386EZJU|5.0|I mean, sheesh, really?     I'm a youngun (18) and I've always had a bit of a thing for instrumentals, soundtracks, what have you- this is probably the first movie of my life I walked out of thinking, I MUST HAVE THAT SOUNDTRACK.    Seriously, this is strong stuff. Emotional roller-coaster stuff. It's like coffee, actually- I've found myself PUMPED after every listening.     The opening, \\"This Is Berk\\" is a rip-roaring rollicking \\"overture\\" of sorts that makes you wanna leap out of bed, grab your horns and a bucket of water, and go fight some dragons.     All in all, it's great listening if you're draggin' a little. (Ha, draggin'... )    Other great tracks include \\"Forbidden Friendship\\" which of course makes you picture some of the most endearing scenes of the movie, while rousing you with the soul-twisting strings at the finale. \\"See You Tomorrow\\", a personal favorite, is a melodramatic little jig between heroic theatrics and unassuming Celtic reel- so cinematic and rousing I've actually used it for curtain-call at a high school play. Astrid's character is repeatedly echoed in her own set of strings, in the ever-so \\"Romantic Flight\\".     It's all so very cinematic, at points, it's almost like watching the movie again- there are moments where you can tell EXACTLY what's supposed to be going on on-screen. It's wonderful.     Do not listen to this right before bed, unless you want to stay up all night. Absolutely listen to it if you need to get something done in your life, as this music will convince you that it is Heroic and Important and Possible. You will GET THINGS DONE to this music, I promise you.
B001OQCV2E|3.0|Pretty much your ordinary Bible coming to an end thing. It should open peoples eyes. I recommend that everyone should watch. It could be the way our world turns out. Especially with what is happening today.
B0019N8P2W|3.0|The release of \\"DARIA\\" on DVD is a mixed blessing: on one hand, it's a long-overdue release of a genuinely excellent series (that I continued to watch weekly even AFTER graduating high school); on the other, its also a painfully truncated version of it that kinda ruins the nostalgia for those of us who remember it differently (with the VHS evidence to prove it).    THE GOOD NEWS: the boxed set allows for complete viewing.  It's very easy to catch up or completely introduce yourself to the series if you were too young the first time around.  And you get to see all five years at once rather than scrounging around for multiple seasons.  I suppose it is better for the show to be available and doctored than to be unavailable at all, since the characters and writing were the key to its power.    AND we get the Pilot episode, which is nice.    THE BAD NEWS: Well, let's start with the music: we all knew that the original music was never going to be included; no one at Viacom will spend the money for licensing on every episode, and until a wealthy fan does so on their own dime, it'll be a dream unrealized.  But the generic music is kinda hard to deal with because sometimes its louder than the dialogue in the scene, or doesn't fit at all.  Also, the Splendora theme song for the opening titles is a different recording than the original broadcast and can be a bit annoying, although some of the Splendora cues made specifically for the movies are still intact.  The music situation is probably only going to hurt purists like me who remember the show from the first time around.    Here are some others, some big, others just nitpicky:    - The second movie/last episode \\"IS IT COLLEGE YET?\\" is the censored Noggin-channel version.  While I've resigned myself to the music problems, this one is inexcusable; MTV owns the series, it should have the original print somewhere.    - The special features are a joke.  Again, due to music issues, the specials \\"Look Back in Annoyance\\" and \\"Behindthe Scenes at Daria\\" are absent, and the retrospective is painfully short, with snippets of interviews rather than actual ones.  Also absent are any TV spots for music (like the Garbage promo from \\"IS IT FALL YET?\\").  However, the animated sections from an MTV video countdown are included, though not the videos themselves.    - The show is in order but with no season dividers; you have to research which episodes were in which season.    - The early episodes are a bit faded; they aren't damaged, but the color isn't as sharp as the later episodes.    - Closed Captioning but no subtitles.    - The movies are shoved on the extras disc, not given context as to which seasons they capped off (video quality is SLIGHTLY inferior as a result).      So overall, the collection isn't a waste for those who want to experience the show as a whole and not as a time capsule.  For those who want the show in its entirety uncut and unaltered...we still have our VHS collections.  But while some things were unavoidable due to rather large legal issues (the music), other things that were entirely solvable (uncut versions, picture quality, etc.), make this an underwhelming accomplishment.  Considering how well the \\"AEON FLUX\\" boxed set turned out, and how terrible the \\"BEAVIS & BUTT-HEAD\\" boxed sets turned out, this one falls in between: neither as good or as bad as it COULD have been.  Three stars is being generous.    Regardless, I would suggest waiting for sales or markdowns to buy it; at the current price it isn't worth it.

1592402038|4.0|Eats, Shoots & Leaves is a very informative, entertaining book. I found when I read it that I not only learned helpful rules of punctuation, but found myself laughing out loud about the history of the first semicolon, or the ignorance of greengrocers. The book showed how one punctuation mark can change the entire meaning of a sentence. After reading this book I have become more aware in my writing for  punctuation errors and also have discovered myself getting upset about punctuation errors that lead to confusion. Lynne Truss appears to be quite obsessed with punctuation and I don't think a better person could've written the book however, at times I was thinking to my self, \\"Really?\\" because she was quite the stickler. Overall the book moved very slow for me because it seemed like she would spend pages upon pages praising the hard work of an apostrophe, or something that wasn't that interesting to me. I agreed with her idea that obvious punctuation errors that lead to misunderstanding should not occur as much as they do in today's society but, when it came to very complex rules of punctuation that she was upset about, I didn't care.  I enjoyed the layout of her writing because she always gave examples and I learned quite a bit about semicolons and colons that I didn't know about previously. I think someone who is interested in learning about punctuation, looking for a humorous book or is a nitpicker for punctuation themselves would greatly enjoy this book.
B002VECM6S|1.0|Yes, the STORY itself is great. The Tuohys should be commended and I am glad they made the film to bring awareness to that. I do like Sandra in it, but was it an Oscar-worthy performance? No. (as a comparison Julia Roberts' performance as Erin Brockovich was far superior) And to put that little kid front and center like that through the whole thing with his over-acting was a total distraction, unrealistic, and annoying. He was the Jar-Jar Binks of the movie for sure. And riiiiiiiiight...this little kid coached Mike making him the great football player that he is because a first grader knows more about football than any real coach does. Sure. Whatever. And TIM MCGRAW in a lead role? Who came up with that idea? Something tells me he didn't show up at the casting call and beat out everyone else out because he's a better actor than all the real actors out there. He's a country western SINGER with NO acting experience (or ability) as I found out from watching this movie. I also find it HARD to believe that she would just be able to yell at some bigoted redneck in the stands and drug dealers and have NO consequences for that at all. Yeah, I'm gonna drive my 7-Series BMW to the drug-dealer hang out, get out dressed in diamonds and expensive clothes and threaten drug dealers who kill people on a regular basis all by myself, get in all of their faces and tell them I have a gun in my $800 Gucci bag and just shut them all down verbally because I'm just ALL THAT? Uh huh. Right.
1423101472|5.0|This book is great... my daughter (11) and son (8) both love the book.  They have read it and re-read it!

Amazon had the best price.
B002UNMWAG|5.0|I don't understand the mixed reviews. I was hesitant to buy this because of the few negative reviews it received. Luckily I went with my gut and bought it. This movie is everything a Saints fan could want. Not only is it a sequel. But it also tells the story of how it all began. It also has a couple of cameo appearance's I won't spoil for you. The final review is simple. If you liked the first Saints, there is no reason you shouldn't like this one. If you have never even seen the first Saints. Well I don't suppose you'll completely understand this movie in full. I believe it's $10 here on Amazon. If you haven't seen the first one do yourself a favor before you watch Boondock Saints II and get caught up on the story. Otherwise I'm quite sure you'll be lost. Boondock Saints fans, don't be fearful. This is a good movie. It's directed and writen by the same person who did the first one. It has the same original cast. This is exactly how a sequel is supposed to be...
0062515675|1.0|\\"The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari\\" is a mish-mash of a rudimentary self-help principles, wound into a \\"fable\\" that goes nowhere. The writing style is cheesy, and the 'wisdom of the sages' that Sharma tries to pass off is corny, without substance, painfully predictable, and in certain places, plagiarised.     If you're looking for real tools for self improvement and motivation, you'd be better off looking up the author of a plagiarised phrase that appears on the back cover \\"...live with passion...\\" (Anthony Robbins).
B002JCSWV6|5.0|If you saw the movie then you know the story. However, as with any movie, the book is always better. And so it is with Invictus. You will appreciate the full personality composites of all the characters in this beautiful story of a great rugby team and a country struggling to find its identity. It made me appreciate the unique country that is South Africa and the curious sport that is rugby. Because of this book, I went further and explored the rugby teams of South Africa and the New Zealand Blacks on YouTube. It was a journey well worth it. I recommend this book for the joy of reading.
B00103584Y|5.0|As a film student studying to be a cinematographer, I am painfully aware of many films and their techniques. I can honestly say that this film was entertaining and exciting for both the film-maker and the cinema enthusiast inside of me. The film itself is wonderfully designed in both the story and the way the film was shot as well. The Blu-Ray is breathtaking; beautifully designed and mastered.     Plot Design  I hate it when plots are revealed to me, so I'll try not to spoil anything here.   The plot was an interesting look on the decisions that people make every day and how those impact others that they encounter. The director used interesting twists and seemingly unrelated concepts to advance the plot, which was nice since he allowed viewers to develop their own concepts and theories about what is actually happening.      Film Design  The cinematography and montage design of the film was excellent. The techniques that they used with soviet constructivist design and intensified continuity heightened the sense of urgency that the film was getting across for most of the film. The shots were beautifully designed, taking some long shots with amazing colors that pop right off of the screen on the Blu-Ray.    Blu-Ray Notes  The menu in the Blu-Ray is functional and themed appropiately with the film. The special features aren't really aything to shake a stick at, but it's nice that they were included nonetheless. The English version of the film with the re-dubbing is not very good at all, as is true for most dubbed films. If you're seriously going to watch the film, I would suggest the German audio with the English subtitles. Also good to note that the Blu-Ray has a great commentary with Franka and the director.

B003L7DK74|5.0|Jermaine and Bret are a pair of New Zealand musicians, living in New York City and hoping to hit it big. Yeah, \\"Flight of the Conchords: The Complete Collection\\" sounds like a terrible generic sitcom, but instead this series is one of the most hilarious comedies of the last decade -- a quirky, weird, tongue-in-cheek little show with hilarious dialogue. Think a musical version of \\"The Office.\\"<br /><br />Folk-pop group Flight of the Conchords is Jermaine Clement and Bret McKenzie (played by themselves), who came all the way from New Zealand to New York. They are being managed by the ineffectual New Zealand Consulate official Murray (Rhys Darby), and they have exactly one fan/stalker, Mel (Kristen Schaal). They don't have many gigs, and even fewer successful ones.<br /><br />As they chase elusive fame'n'fortune, the guys have to deal with girlfriend woes (dating the same girl, a \\"Yoko\\", a girl who just wants to use Bret for sex), financial difficulties (Bret bought a cup!), jobs, muggings, anti-Kiwi racism, a problematic rock'n'roll tour, two new fans with impure intentions, a semi-professional actor/compulsive liar who makes Murray think they've got a multimillion-dollar deal, the Crazy Doggz, Australians, epileptic terriers, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, hair gel, and a stage musical based on their misadventures.<br /><br />If I had to come up with a description for \\"Flight of the Conchords,\\" it would be that they're the folky New Zealand love child of Spinal Tap and \\"The Office.\\" No laugh track, rambling dialogue, and the main characters tend to spontaneously break into song-and-dance at pivotal parts of the plot. And it's brilliant.<br /><br />The writing is brimming over with effortless weirdness, as the guys encounter everyday problems (threesomes, girlfriend woes, weird dreams) which soon turn into hilariously surreal situations (the disturbing children's show, \\"Albi the Racist Dragon\\"). The dialogue is amazing (\\"When I first met you you tried to have me deported from New Zealand because you thought I was an Australian\\"), and full of rambling conversations that just get stranger with every line (\\"Have you ever had a threesome?\\" \\"Nearly.\\" \\"What do you mean, nearly?\\" \\"I've had a twosome\\").<br /><br />The songs are gutsplitting as well, since they're all about homicidal robots, mermaids, toothpaste, hip-hop spoofs, hermaphrodites (\\"Oh you sexy hermaphrodite lady-man-ladies\\"), rappers, cannibalism, and the hiphop-potamus. Not to mention \\"Frodo, Don't Wear the Ring\\" and its accompanying music video, which are a nod to McKenzie's role as the elf Figwit.<br /><br />But none of this would be even half as funny if it weren't for the actors -- Clement's self-named chatacter is stoic and kind of weird (he writes a song about putting a wig on Bret), while McKenzie's is more childlike, naive and likes to sit in a cardboard box. Darby rounds out the cast as their harried, rather pathetic manager (who isn't even supposed to be managing a band), and Schaal is also quite funny as a woman who has a creepy sexual fixation on the guys.<br /><br />\\"Flight of the Conchords: The Complete Series\\" is one of the rarest kind of comedy out there -- steady, hysterical, and only gets better with repeated viewings.

0385732554|5.0|If you appreciate the genius of 1984 &/or A Brave New World, you will also love The Giver. This is a sentiment expressed by other reviewers that I would like to echo. An important area where I disagree with other reviewers though is that just because the main character is a child, that that makes this a book only for children. Many very adult issues are discussed in The Giver about the direction in which the world is moving. But I am very gratified that adolescents are also reading this book in school. It will help them to think about the future and what kind of world they would like to inherit.<br /><br />The society described in The Giver leads \\"The life where nothing was ever unexpected. Or inconvenient. Or unusual. The life without color, pain, or past.\\" (p.164) This is largely due to societies' conscious group decision, referred to as the \\"Sameness,\\" to eliminate pain through constant medication (similar to A Brave New World). While everyone is assigned a job in the community, and even a family to raise them (not their natural parents) from the time they are babies. There are no longer conscious choices to be made in life. Societies' collective memories of pleasure and pain are the burden of one individual: the Giver, who then passes on collective pain and pleasure to a child, who succeeds him. Old people also no longer have any use in society and live together in group homes until society decides to \\"release\\" them, a term that loosely describes euthanasia.<br /><br />The Giver is beautifully written and there are many amazing plot twists along the way. The world described by Lois Lowry seems deceptively utopian in places until shocking revelations are disclosed about the truth of the future community. The society described is also similar enough in places to the world in which we live today as to make the reader both uncomfortable and wonder about the collective choices being made in the name of social harmony. The Giver is a very important, prescient book.
B0021L8V1G|4.0|[THIS IS BEING WRITTEN AT THE TIME OF THE THEATRICAL RELEASE -- AS OF THIS WRITING, THE DVD IS NOT OUT YET, THANKS.]<br /><br />Unlike other superhero films, with shoot 'em up action, crazed villains and a conflicted hero who is put into life threatening situations for himself and those he loves, director Favreau decided on a different take.<br /><br />Favreau went on an Iron-Deficient diet!  And instead created a story about Tony the man.  Tony the billionaire, arrogant playboy.  Tony, the man who is dying.<br /><br />The Paramount logo barely glows on the big screen when we hear the audio of the Senate hearings by a smarmy senator who demands the Iron suit \\"weapon\\" for the USA.  Tony wants it for himself and congratulates himself on \\"privatizing World Peace\\" *kiss kiss*<br /><br />However, the metal he is using for the energy core that is keeping him alive as well as powering the Iron suit is killing him.  CGI veins darken his neck.  But in a fit of wanting to protect those he loves by pushing them away, he gives away his art gallery, gives his CEO post to Pepper Potts and decides to party his life away.<br /><br />The world however ,was not meant to give Stark a relaxing good time.<br /><br />The other side of the world has a Russian physicist whose father worked for and later apparently discarded by Tony's father.  This man, Ivan, wants revenge.  Collaborating with a government stooge (Justin Hammer, a real idiot) he invents Iron-man clones which as we will later see will be used to bring down Stark Industries (known colloquially as \\"Hammer-oids\\").  Hey, I could NOT make this stuff up, OK??<br /><br />I disagree with critics who feel it's another Spider-man 3 [[[ASIN:B00005JPFH Spider-Man 3 (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]] with a bunch of villains and mixing it up.  Far from it.<br /><br />The \\"women of steel\\" include Black Widow, working under cover for SHIELD as Tony's legal adviser (and man she is fine) and a great martial artist.  Love the fight scenes!  The other \\"woman of steel\\" is Pepper Potts, who is at her wits end about what to do about and with Tony.  She loves him but she can't stand him.  Whadda predicaminckt!<br /><br />The real player is Tony's dad.  We watch a film that would have done Disney proud as the \\"Key to the Future\\" is revealed (complete with Disney-esque music and style) but is actually more than it seems -- and gives Tony a key to his future.<br /><br />The relationship angle was a welcome change for the superhero film.  It's mostly story and plot and interaction between characters.  Yes, there are explosions and broken glass and flying bullets and guns -- but these are secondary -- even the villain is secondary -- to the man and the myth that is Stark.<br /><br />I was impressed!<br /><br />Minus one star for the slow pace.  I found that it went on a little too long, with Tony getting drunk, smashing up his own birthday party and so on.  The Shield connection and Black Widow's part could have been expanded in lieu of the silly party antics.<br /><br />Don't forget to stay to the end of the credits!  There's a cool chestnut for you Marvel Comics fans!<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Character driven, real story and substance into the man that is Tony Stark, as he finds his body betraying him, as he is slowly dying and does not have a lot of options.

0393075966|4.0|Professor Stiglitz seems to believe, like Hillary Clinton, that you should \\"never waste a good crisis\\".  This book uses the events leading to the Great Recession as a framework for well-supported criticisms of the mortgage and banking industries, the federal reserve, presidents and treasury secretaries, economists, politicians and global leaders.  Stiglitz believes that the ideology of market fundamentalism applied to macroeconomics, industrial policy, regulation, finance, monetary policy and politics has created and shaped the poor handling of the crisis (Obama is not spared).    The author documents an impressive history of sins and failures that have allegedly resulted from over reliance on a simplistic free market approach: fraud, recession, unfair policies, slow growth, less innovation, greater income disparities, corporate welfare, increased volatility/risk/insecurity, unemployment, protectionism and waste.  He provides historical context, analyzing situations and recommending policies and solutions.    The Economics Nobel laureate is a believer in the free market as an engine of growth and progress for domestic and global economies.  However, he argues that research, statistics, theory and history consistently demonstrate the inadequacy of the Chicago school's approach as popularized by the Reagan and Thatcher governments and increasingly applied since then.    The author is most passionate about the negative impact of market fundamentalism in the political and cultural spheres.  He says that the emphasis on material goods, profits and self-interest alone leads to a weaker economy and society.   He reminds the reader that economic and social institutions are created and justified by the political process to meet community needs and reflect community values.  Professor Stiglitz believes that a values based vision needs to guide future choices, which include a balance between market and government roles.    The author applies economic theory and political viewsin equal parts.  Left-center readers will enjoy this comprehensive summary of what is wrong with the world.  Right-center readers will struggle to separate the politics from the well-grounded economic recommendations.  This is a well-written book that addresses many important current topics in a coherent manner.  Stiglitz takes a critical and negative approach to most topics.  He may be surprised by the amount of \\"progress\\" currently being made in the political arena to transform this crisis into a new balance between markets and governments.  His critics may blame him for an unwarranted growth of government power and interference with the free market.
0440238609|5.0|This trilogy is one of the best i've read since Lord of the rings, althought it has nothing to do with it. It stands in a whole different universe which paradoxically seems more real than a fantastic one. Exceedingly good reading. The plot is something else!!! Not only for children like intended in the movie The  golden compass (which by the was has nothing to do with the book itself). This is the second time i read this trilogy the first one was in spanish and the transaltion is a ton different!!! Lost in translation he he.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Although presented in a similar format, this is not Band of Brothers Part II. Nor should anyone expect it to be. There is much more combat/violence in this series, but I didn't feel that that takes away from the story. That, being the infantry WAR in the Pacific. Get it? It's about what, again . . . ?     I also appreciated not having every nuance and detail explained for me. As when Basilone's wife appears in formal dress above the beach at the end of episode 8. Or the B-29 pass over at the end of episode 9. And anyone asking 'Where are they going?', needs to pick up a history book.    One thing that may have been changed is Tom Hanks's opening narrations. I know of many narrators that would have provided a much better presentation. Whether it was ego, or a way to save bucks, who knows?    And unlike a few here, I WILL be buying this DVD series. Folks, if you want to see more of these types of series made that entertain and remind us of how veterans lived and died, then you need to support these types of efforts with your dollars. In the end, a terrific series.
B000NA1OXY|3.0|When I first bought \\"The Best Damn Thing\\" I was really addicted to it, but what really bothered by was Avril Lavigne's new image. All the songs really relate to Avril's new image. This has to be the worst album Avril has had. Alot of song are good but the album is just crap.    1. Girlfriend- The first single off the album which debuted at #1 on the Billboard. This song can be good but It's very annoying with Avril rapping. 3/5    2. I Can Do Better- A very good song with alot of swearing in it. I thought this song was gonna be realeased as a single, but it wasn't. 5/5    3. Runaway- Very catchy and one off my favorites. you can easily sing along to this track. 5/5    4. The Best Damn Thing- At first I hated this song but It grew on me. I love it when she spells out her name. 3/5    5. When You're Gone- The best on the album. The lyrics are amazing and beautiul. 5/5    6. Everything Back But You- This song is really fun. It isn't the best on the album but it's worth listening to. 5/5    7. Hot- The 3rd single which didn't do well on the charts. But it will make you wanna listen to it over again. 5/5    8. Innocence- A very beautiful ballad. Many fans say this is the best song on the album which I agree to but It can be the song people want to skip to. 4/5    9. I Don't Have To Try- The lyrics are ok but Avril's vocals are terrible and she sounds like she is screeching. 4/5    10. One Of Those Girls- My least favorite off the album. That's all I can say/ 3/5    11. Contagious- My personal favorite. The beat is very catchy and so are the lyrics. 5/5    12. Keep Holding On- Written for the movie Eragon. The song is quite beautiful but I don't really listen to it. 4/5
B000P12LWY|5.0|King Henry VIII was a pivotal figure in English and Western history.  As the Protestant Reformation sweeps Europe, the great question is whether England will remain Catholic, under the Pope's authority, or whether the King's authority shall predominate in England.  King Henry VIII settled this matter for all time, at a time when religious authority truly mattered to the conduct of national affairs in Europe.<br /><br />This series is dazzlingly presented, with fine acting and a gripping, if somewhat leisurely, storyline.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers turns in a bravo performance as King Henry VIII--his intensity in the role is vibrant and convincing.  Sam Neill, as usual, is particularly fine as English Cardinal Wolsey, the King's Chancellor and confidant.  Along with Meyers he dominates Season One.  All of other the key roles are splendidly cast, and the sets are lavish; this is a beautiful production.<br /><br />Season 1 takes us from Henry's ascension to the throne, during which he gains confidence in his role of King of England and head of state--to his love of Anne Boleyn and his rejection of the queen.  The viewer sees in action Machiavelli's admonishment in The Prince that it is deadly to cross a Prince, and dangerous to be his friend.<br /><br />This series is eminently watchable and a great introduction to a critical period in European history.  If it takes liberties with history, the discerning viewer will not mind.  Highly recommended.  RJB.
B000066NW0|5.0|\\"Let Go\\" is the debut album by Canadian singer Avril Lavigne. I remember buying this album when I was only 8 yrs old and I was just so hooked on it. I thought all her songs were good. The song that really got me hooked was \\"Losing Grip\\". Well, here is how I would rate each individual song.    1. Losing Grip- A great song to start the album with. I just love the beat and lyrics. was written about an ex-boyfriend Avril had. 5/5    2. Complicated- The first single off the album. This song was so overplayed on many radio stations. I do love this song, but I can be boring. 4/5    3. Sk8er Boi- This was the song that encouraged me to have this album. This song is probably the most famous song Avril has ever written. 5/5    4. I'm With You- My personal favorite. When I first heard it, I thought it was the worst song on the album, but when I got older It really grew on me and It's my all time favorite. 5/5    5. Mobile- Great song with a sound of country in it. It's probably not the best song on the album but It's definately worth listening to. 5/5    6. Unwnated- One of my favorites on the album. The beat is very chilling. 5/5    7. Tomorrow- The ballad on the album. Many Avril fans say this is their favorite song but to me it's the worst song on the album. 3/5    8. Anything But Ordinary- My second favorite on the album. The beat and lyrics are just amazing. 5/5    9. Things I'll Never Say- The most beautiful song on the album. I love it when she sings \\"Am I squeezing you too tight?\\" 4/5    10. My World- This song Avril talks about her life growing up in Napanee. This song will take you on a journey. 5/5    11. Nobody's Fool- Avril raps in the beginning of the song and it sounds completely terrible but the song has grown on me but I still usually skip it. 4/5    12. Too Much To Ask- One of the best songs on the album. Avril sounds kind of angry in it which makes it awesome. 5/5    13. Naked- A great song to end the album with. Is one of my favorites. Avril sings about notfeeling in her \\"Skin\\" 5/5
B00319KS7C|4.0|This is a distinct movie and when I say distinct, I mean it won't appeal to most but it definitely appealed to me.  I found the plot line believable, found the story's pace good...I liked Matt Damon's portrayal...
B0001UL7RY|5.0|\\"Under My Skin\\" is Avril Lavigne's 2nd album. Personally I have to say this is her best album ever. It may sound dark but it has to be her best album so far.    1. Take Me Away- A kick off first song. Avril's vocals are so amazing in this song. 5/5    2. Together- One of my favorites. Avril really has strong vocals in this one too. 5/5    3. Don't Tell Me- The first single on the album. At first I thought It was about sex but when I really listend to it. it was about being in control. What a great song. 5/5    4. He Wasn't- At first I absolutely loved it but then It got kinda boring. I still love this song, but I usually skip it. 4/5    5. How Does It Feel- The ballad on the album. It may be the song everyone wants to skip but It's really beautiful and worth listening to. 5/5    6. My Happy Ending- My personal favorite on the album. At first I didn't care for this song but it has really grown on me. 5/5    7. Nobody's Home- The best on the album. Avril wrote this song about a girl she knew who had some problems. Written beautifully. 5/5    8. Forgotten- The darkest song on the album with a catchy beat. 5/5    9. Who Knows- My least favorite off the album. Avril sings about letting yourself have a good day and there is always another. Very beautiful. 3/5    10. Fall To Pieces- Slow rock ballad that is very beautful. I really don't care for this song but it's definatly a stand out track. 4/5    11. Freak Out- I love this song, it's so crazy. Avril sings about living your life. 5/5    12. Slipped Away- The 2nd best on the album. Written in loving memory about Avril's grandpa who passed away. 5/5
0142000655|5.0|This is a phenomenal book. The story and characters are rich and complex~ the prose is beautiful. Steinbeck's best novel by far. I read this as a teenager and reread it recently on a vacation and it was even better the second time. I was so sorry for it to end and to say goodbye to the characters... there isn't much to add that hasn't already been said in previous reviews; but I am thrilled that Oprah featured this book so perhaps more people will pick it up and experience it. A classic, a masterpeice.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|After reading all the negative reviews I must admit that I had great experience watching it. It is just a movie made on a fictional story and I had gr8 time watching it! To all the complainers; pls complain about real facts when those are stated incorrectly-thx!
0061148512|5.0|The Bell Jar is an extraordinary piece of literature that delves into the very substance of Plath's mind, and her frustration with the outside world and the people within it.  Plath's descriptions and metaphors of her surroundings give insight into her coming-of-age phase and her fall into a deep, dark state.  Wonderfully written and an intriguing interpretation of what some of us regard as this dismal world, you'll come back to read it over and over.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|I watched it and had gr8 time watching it. I wish to see another movie by Emmerich made from the story written by Arthur Vonshtain \\"Free to Be Me\\", Rolland could make a great masterpiece from it! Nevertheless I will always watch any movie made by Emmerich.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|I have never listened to Bob Bylan - never been interested, until a friend had me listening to \\"Modern Times\\", specifically, \\"Ain't talkin'\\".  A great song with rhythm, integrity and depth.  Wanted to buy the album after checking on Amazon for the rest of the songs; enjoy the rocking start of \\"Thunder on the mountain\\" and one of my sons enjoys \\"Beyond the horizon\\" - not certain why, but if he enjoys it, that's okay.  Overall, I am enjoying the poetical musicality (if that means anything?!) of the CD.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Before I begin this review, yes, Glenn Eichler does put in a disclaimer about why the DVD Collection had changed all the music sound bites.  Mainly due to the fact although MTV never had a problem with using them on their network, whenever you attempt to put it on another medium, you end up dealing with outrageous licensing issues.<br /><br />Bottom line, it makes it impossible to release the collection because one would have to sell it at about $500 or so, not to mention getting approval by the artists themselves.  By that time, you'd never get the aforementioned item in a collection such as this.  (Probably why we'll never see the Gamera episodes of MST3K on DVD.. ah, well).<br /><br />But enough grousing about insignificant details, let's get onto the collection itself.<br /><br />First off, it's amazing something spun-off from Mike Judge's \\"Beavis & Butthead,\\" genuinely became an animated cult-classic.  Essentially because at the time, Daria was simply a passing character, attempting to be the voice of reason for these guys.  Whereas here, she's pretty much a realistic teen dealing with the nonsense which makes up high-school life.<br /><br />\\"Daria\\" has a refreshing spin when you watch it because it doesn't follow the typical 'teen' mould of animation.  No angst, no emotional nonsense, no 'brainless' adults, just a person dealing with the realistic (?) view of teenage life.  Back in the late 90's, thanks to shows like \\"Saved by the Bell,\\" \\"Galaxy High,\\" and other teen-based shows out there, basically you had the youth coming up like intelligent know-it-alls, while the grown-ups were usually portrayed as clueless adults.  Whereas with Daria, usually the problem with adults, was they were too absorbed with their agendas, or being too condescending.<br /><br />Unlike other shows, Daria's parents usually knew what was going on at times, even though sometimes her sister, Quinn could usually pull a fast one on their father now and again.  And unexpectedly would help their daughters out of jams.<br /><br />\\"Arts & Crass\\" happens to be an excellent example, Jane & Daria get roped into participating with a poster contest for Lawndale High.  In true Daria fashion, Jane paints a picture of a young girl looking into a mirror, while Daria provides a rather controversial poem to go with it.  Amazingly, it gets submitted but Principal Li has the poem altered against Daria & Jane's wishes.  Of course, after they 'deface' their entry, Principal Li attempts in informing Daria's mom about the incident (apparently Jane's mother's off in her own little world).  But before Li can suggest any punishment, Helen utilizes her legal knowledge for getting Daria & Jane off the hook.<br /><br />Another reason Daria has endured so well is the characters develop than just keep on being 'recycled' in endless persona.  For instance in Season One, Quinn is essentially the superficial opposite of Daria. But at the end of Season Five - and the movie finale, she starts realizing there's more to life than just fashion and popularity, much to Sandy's chagrin.<br /><br />Overall, The Complete Series is great for any Daria fan out there, or someone who might want something a bit different than the teen fanfare shoveled out there by Disney.Crass\\" happens to be an excellent example, Jane & Daria get roped into participating with a poster contest for Lawndale High.

0547258305|4.0|Graceling was a well written fantasy novel with action, adventure, and romance.  People who are Graced have two different colored eyes and have some special abilities like fighting, mind reading, swimming like a fish, etc.  Katsa is Graced,she believes, as a killer.  She meets Po, Graced as well, and they try to solve the mystery of why and who kidnapped the Lienid royal grandfather.  Together they learn more about their Graces and each other.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this novel, but I don't really think it should be marketed as Young Adult.  I think this is more of an adult fantasy because of the sex and violence. The sex is outside of marriage which may be a problem for some parents.  Also, there are mutilations of animals and people throughout this novel.  There is quite a bit of violence.<br /><br />This novel is based in a make believe world, but it has a medieval feel to it, so if you enjoy novels in this time period, you will enjoy Graceling.  I did really like this novel, and I was interested the whole time I was reading.  The ending, however, caused me to be aggravated.  If the next novel, Fire, dealt with the same characters and picked up where this one left off I would have enjoyed it more knowing that I could continue their story(it doesn't).  It ends without feeling really fulfilling, or at least to me.  I like the end of a novel, unless it is a series that picks up where it left off, to feel complete.  I can't fully describe why I was annoyed without giving away the ending.  Lets just say that I did not get everything I wanted.  Still, I would recommend this novel to anyone who likes this genre, but I would not recommend this book for younger teens.

B002XTBE6K|2.0|I expected a great deal from this video since all the reviews I had read rated it highly and my own brother enjoyed it immensely. I was also encouraged by it's length, for surely in 4 hours they would be able to finally show all the subtle nuances and interaction between each of the characters that made me love this book so much. Now I wonder how many of them (including my brother) has even read the book. It was like watching Mel Gibson's Hamlet all over again, an enjoyable movie as long as you have no idea how the story is really supposed to go.<br /><br />This version of Emma takes all 4 hours to give you the story of Emma's entire life even if they have to make it up.  There is the inclusion of several scenes found no where in the book used to explain (if not outright change) the people around her when simply following the story as given would have accomplished all that and more.  There is absolutely no subtlety to the interpretation but rather it is as if, failing to understand the story themselves, the script writer attempted to make it as similar to the A&E \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" as possible within the framework of the story given.  The frequent 20th century mannerisms would not have been quite so glaring if not for their frequency at times or their appearance in the same created scenes.  I found myself expressing disbelief more then once in outrage at Emma's entirely inappropriate behavior in a young lady that is portrayed as so refined in the original writing.<br /><br />The subtle interplay in the book that illuminates the characters is entirely missing with the exception of some lip service in the beginning as to the character of Emma's father.  Even that is dropped quickly and nearly ignored. As I often do with movies like this I watched it with my husband who has not read the books, nor intends to.  Each time something was done differently or omitted and I took the time to explain it to him or tell him the original dialog he would laugh quite heartily; the rest of the time he was for the most part entirely bored.  Afterward I took the time to explain to him the real reason for Jane's discomfort over discussing the Campbells and Dixon, the relationship between Emma and her governess and the inability for anyone other then Mr Knightly to check her, missing scenes of her scheming to bring about a marriage between Ms Smith and Mr Elton, how and why Ms Smith told Emma personally about her decision to marry Mr Martin after all, how much Emma's response to this showed her growth as a person, and just how Emma and Mr Knightly actually convinced Emma's father to give his consent to their own marriage and, as before, my husband enjoyed the explanations immensely but had no way of knowing any of it from what he had seen in this movie.<br /><br />I attempt to collect the movie versions of each of Jane Austins stories that I feel has done them justice.  This one will not be joining my collection.he was for the most part entirely bored.

B002NZK5TG|5.0|Had to watch the movie after seeing the stage play version.  My daughter and I had a great time bonding and watching this movie.  Don't know how I managed to miss this one when it first came out.
0679804021|4.0|Buyers should be aware that is an abridged version of the classic tale.    This edition captured the imagination of my 7-year old.  It's a terrific stepping stone for this age group, but should not be reviewed as if it were Robert Louis Stevenson's original classic.
0321356683|4.0|It's a good book indeed, it touches many aspects of the Java language, well written. Although, other books are required if you really want to know more, like Java Generics and Java Concurrency in Practice.
B001C4AFOY|4.0|I saw this movie on the plane from London to Atlanta.  I thought the writing was excellent and the actors portrayal was also.
B001C4AFOY|4.0|It is not often that I wish movies were longer, however in The Young Victoria I wish that the movie had more depth to it.  The movie was solid and Emily Blunt was fantastic but it left me wanting more of the story.  For much of the movie I was having to put pieces together because all the information was not there.  The acting is superb, the realism of being in 1820's Britain is there and the fact that it is an actual family movie is probably the biggest plus of all.  This is a definate recommend selection!
B001OQCV6K|5.0|We went to see the new Sherlock Holmes movie as soon as it came out and liked it so much we purchased the Blue Ray edition when it came out.  We have watched it and enjoyed it again.  Plus the additional features included on the disk are great.  Highly recommend.
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|It only took a couple of huge misses like Valiant and Pixar bringing in all the money and critical acclaim to get Disney back on the right track. That's not to say I'm one of those people who is anti-CG and thinks anything hand-drawn is good just because of how it's animated, but face it, Disney's own CG animated movies are best forgotten. And most of their 2D animated movies after Lilo and Stitch were a joke. I finally watched The Princess and the Frog tonight, after hearing my 3 year old daughter rave about it and how cool the Shadow Man is. And you know what? This IS a pretty damn good movie. To me, it seems like this could've come out in the early 90s along with Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and The Rescuers Down Under and fit right in. There really isn't much I can say as far as the negatives go with this movie aside from that I wanted it to be a little longer, and that I wish Shadow Man would've gotten more screen time.    The story is pretty basic, but still fun. Tiana is a lower class girl trying to save up enough money to buy a building and turn it into a restaurant, which was a dream her father had. She's working two jobs as a waitress, and saves every cent she can, filling a bunch of coffee cans with tips. One day, Prince Naveen comes to town in search of a rich princess to marry since his parents cut him off, and it's either that or get a job. Tiana's friend Charlotte just happens to fit the bill, but before he can do anything, he takes a chance at getting rich an easier way thanks to the sinister Shadow Man. Long story short, Naveen turns into a frog and Tiana turns into a frog as well when she tries to turn him back with a kiss just like the old fairy tale. The two set off to find a way to turn human again before it's permanent, and before someone else marries Charlotte.    I really did love everything about this movie. Most of the songs are memorable, especially Almost There and Friends on the Other Side. Though if you think about it, the animation during the latter is an awful lot like the Genie's song in Aladdin- A Friend Like Me. Regardless, the Shadow Man is one of the coolest Disney villains, animated or live action, to appear in a long time. He's kind of a cross between Ursula and Jafar, and the fact that he uses his shadow to control other people via their shadows is just plain rad. I was just disappointed that he got little screen time compared to other Disney greats like Scar, Ursula, Jafar and even lesser ones like Clayton. The animation, while it did have a lot of CG bits here and there (magazine covers and cards stood out like a sore thumb), was beautiful, and the character designs are a lot like those in the early/mid 90s, before Disney started to get weird like they did with Mulan and Hercules. The cast of characters is great, and characters I thought were just going to be comic relief ended up having some truly heart warming moments. What can I say? This is a great movie, and anyone who had doubts about Disney's future needs to check it out.    Both the audio and picture quality on the blu-ray are perfect. 'not much else needs to be said here. As for the extras, well, go look at the list of them, 'cause there's a lot and I don't have enough room to talk about them all. But each extra covers nearly every aspect of making the film, though most of them are a bit on the short side. It's good to see that a newer film like this is getting the same treatment as the Platinum and Diamond editions of Snow White and others. If a special edition of this comes out in a few years, I really have no idea what extras they can throw in aside from a retrospective or something. And hey, you're also getting the dvd and digital copy here too, so you can keep the blu-ray at home to enjoy on a nice tv/sound system, bring the dvd in the car for trips, and have an extra copy on your computer or portable media player. This is a great deal.    Do yourself a favor and get this movie, if not for your kids, for yourself if you're a fan of animation and good jazz music. I've seen a lot of reviews talking about how kids were scared by the Shadow Man, but really, it depends on what your kids like. My daughter loves 'scary' things like the Nightmare Before Christmas, Skelanimals and Dia de los Muertos style art, and she's only 3. Needless to say, when another kid would say that he's scary when watching the movie with her, she'd go \\"no, he's cool!\\". But aside from that, there's not much here that should be questionable for anyone. Thanks for making this movie Disney, now keep up the good work with the next few and we'll see if you can get back on the road to greatness that you once were.
B002VECM6S|5.0|First off Sandra looks good as a blonde; Second, she gave a great performance and I've seen her come up and this was the best. After Ms Bullock won Best Actress, my mom didn't like all the news about her recent situation and felt sorry for her and wanted to see the movie for herself; so I went and got a copy to check things out and once I was satisfied with that, I got her a copy of her own for Mother's Day right here on Amazon.com; She was happy for it and got to see the movie on Mother's Day and truly liked it especially the part when she told the son what she'll do to him if he got some girl pregnant; I also liked the little fella in the picture, he had heart. He tickled me when he grilled those coaches on what they could give him; you would have thought he was going to college instead of Michael; This young man was blessed to have this family in his corner and it made the difference between having a life or having nothing.

0307454541|2.0|I started out enjoying the exposure to Swedish culture and investigative journalism. Then I got to where to continue, I needed to overlook inconsistencies. Why would a highly conservative elderly industrialist choose Mikael Blomkvist, a recently canned journalist, to solve the mystery of his missing niece? Surely reporter Blomkvist sometimes looked good at his work, but I see the central figure of Henrik Vager as being more careful than to hire someone who lived a licentious lifestyle. So if bedding with a co-worker who is married, and later conveniently doing the same with a troubled girl who is young enough to be his daughter are okay with modern society, I can't believe the highly selective boss would have thought the selective lack of values didn't matter.<br /><br />The \\"troubled girl,\\" Lisbeth Salander defies logic in that although she uses her computer hacking skills for a good purpose, the investigation of some who turn out to be criminals, she breaks the law repeatedly for years and never gets caught.<br /><br />She also breaks the law of nature repeatedly and never gets caught: hot sex with no condoms  . . . no problem, don't worry about it. The reality of impending motherhood never seems to be even a possibility. Fiction is so convenient.<br /><br />And the final defiance of logic, the author's alter ego, Mikael Blomkvist, by living the Bohemian lifestyle with tobacco, workaholism, and sexual adventurism, became rich and famous, and lived happily ever after.<br /><br />In reality, the author dropped dead at age 50 of a heart attack. One is saddened but can't help but wonder if his lifestyle played a role.
B002T45VX6|5.0|I really don't understand people. First they write negative reviews for the phenomenal Oral Fixation album for being too soft and laying down the ballads and not giving them enough \\"Hips Don't Lie\\". And now, they bash her here for being too dance oriented and for not taking a reflective acoustic direction on this new album.     Seriously people??? What is wrong with you? Make up your minds!!    This album nonetheless is phenomenal dance music with extremely intelligent lyrics. I can't stop singing it and playing it all day. Shakira really out did her self with this extremely underappreciated album. No wonder critics went crazy over it. It really is worth all the hype.    If you want pop music with meaning then you should get this album. Shakira knows how to craft a song with amazing lyricism and she shines brilliantly with her great melodies and the sick beats in the background.    Beyoncé should just retire cause she's already got Lady Gaga outracing her in her short 2 years, and now she has Shakira making a mainstream album that's consistent all the way through and that's extremely well crafted.    Bravo Shakira!!    My Top 5    1. She Wolf  2. Mon Amour  3. Gypsy  4. Long Time  5. Men In This Town    If you're a person who just likes a good beat and catchy melodies, This album is for you.  If you're a person who loves amazingly written lyrics with intelligent meanings. This album is for you.  And If you love both for the price of one. This album is for you.    SHE WOLF IS A MUST LISTEN!!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|The only thing I did not like about this Blu Ray disc was the fact that I had to go to my Blu Ray player manufacturer's web site and download an update for my player before I could play the DVD.  The movie, in and of itself, is a wonderful addition to my Blu Ray collection-- a good story, beautifully produced with unbelievable graphics.  I will enjoy this movie for a long time to come.
B002ZG9846|2.0|I really wanted to like KICK-ASS.  The premise and the apparent message of ordinary people standing up to villains and crime and making a difference was very, very appealing.  But honestly, the only reason to watch KICK-ASS is the 3 fight scenes with the little girl. That's it. End of story. Of course, they are very violent and bloody, so if you can't imagine watching an 11-year-old girl stab, shoot, and slice the legs off of countless thug-types who deserve it, then there's no reason for you to watch KICK-ASS.<br /><br />But let's say you've been tricked into seeing KICK-ASS or someone has threatened to post unflattering photos of you and your hamster on Facebook if you don't watch the entire flick.  So you're sitting there in an empty theater and what do you see? Well, for the first 30 minutes, you DO NOT see any superhero stuff. No, you see pointless drivel about how hard it is to be a nerdy teenager. You get to see the main character's masturbatory fantasies (literally and graphically). And you wonder how this schmuck could afford a $99 wet suit. Finally, right around the 30 minute mark, he dons his wet suit, gets beaten to a bloody pulp, and sent to the hospital where everyone believes he's gay. So now, not only is he a nerdy teen, he's a faux gay nerdy teen.<br /><br />But I haven't mentioned the plot. Oh wait. For 33% of KICK-ASS, that IS the plot.  For the other 66%, it is a lot of gratuitous violence and gore.<br /><br />I was really disappointed in KICK-ASS.  It could have been a really good, positive movie.  But it degenerated into teen angst, gratuitous violence, and copious blood pretty quickly.  Yes, there are some funny moments, and yes, the ending is actually satisfying, but overall, KICK-ASS is just disturbing, and I won't recommend it to anyone.
0545123267|4.0|This is a werewolf love story but it isn't a Twilight rip-off.  This is a beautifully-written story about love between two well-defined characters (Grace and Sam) and how they use their brains to get themselves out of predicaments.<br />The plot is fairly straightforward.  Sam (the werewolf) turns wolf when it gets cold.  And the longer he stays a wolf, the less time he gets to spend as a human.  Pretty soon, he will be a wolf all the time.  Grace is drawn to the wolf with the yellow eyes (Sam) and when she meets him in human form it's love at first sight.  Now \\"all\\" Sam and Grace have to do is figure out how to keep him human.<br /><br />The chapters alternate with the points of view.  Sometimes Sam does the talking and sometimes Grace.  However, the two characters have such unique voices that you don't really need to check to see who is doing the talking.  And, unlike, Twilight Maggie Stiefvater doesn't allow the plot to turn to melodrama--there is just too much humor here for that.<br /><br />There is sex in this story.  However, it is more of a fade out kind of thing.  Still, that is something parents may want to know.<br /><br />I would recommend this book.

B002ZRPQ5K|3.0|Keane has been exploring different sounds ever since the release of their first album, Hopes and Fears, in 2004. Originally labeled as a Coldplay copycat, Keane quickly went to work at proving critics wrong. With Hopes and Fears garnering its success from ballads like \\"Somewhere Only We Know,\\" most fans expected Keane to follow suit with their sophomore release, Under the Iron Sea. Instead, while still extremely melodic and radio-friendly, Keane released a collection of much darker tunes. Lead singer Tom Chaplin's incredibly clear vocals were still given a chance to show off their range while Tim Rice-Oxley's keyboard parts were processed with additional effects often reserved for guitars. Although the mood was different, the overall sound was still recognizable which was apparently not enough for Keane.<br /><br />In 2008, Keane's third album, Perfect Symmetry, shattered everyone's perceptions of the band they thought they knew. Regardless of the mood, the ballads were replaced with 80s pop tunes. The sonic exploration may have cost Keane some album sales, but for anyone patient enough to truly give the album a shot, the reward was certainly present. Keane finally seemed to be having fun with their music and it was an equally fun album to experience as a listener. An enthusiastic \\"wooooh!\\" opened the album as a kind of sigh of relief, finally shedding the shackles of their former \\"Coldplay-like\\" label.<br /><br />Now, two years later, Keane's new EP, ringing in at over 30 minutes of music, is as much of a follow-up to Perfect Symmetry as Under the Iron Sea was a follow-up to Hopes and Fears. The 80s pop is still very much present on tracks like \\"Back in Time\\" and \\"Your Love\\" while Keane's ever present desire to continue changing is aided by the presence of Japanese singer Tigarah and Somali hip-hop star K'Naan. Perhaps Keane opted to label Night Train as an EP due to their presence, but Keane has once again proven they are not tied down by a single genre. K'Naan's first words on the record are \\"sometimes I feel like it's all been done...sometimes I wanna change everything I've ever done \\" which speak volumes about Keane's opinion of the music industry and their own sound.<br /><br />Night Train may be hard to swallow for fans of Keane's early work, but by having fun making music, Keane has managed to evolve while still finding success. Perfect Symmetry was ultimately more satisfying than Night Train after mutliple listens, but if you were looking for something new, give this a shot.<br /><br />Similar Artists: The Killers, Snow Patrol<br /><br />Track Suggestion: \\"Stop For a Minute\\"he record are \\"sometimes I feel like it's all been done...sometimes I wanna change everything I've ever done \\" which speak volumes about Keane's opinion of the music industry and their own sound.

B001FB55L2|4.0|When this movie first came out, all trailers and advertisements misled audiences into believing that it was some sort of a love-triangle type story a la \\"Legends of the Fall\\" - you know, two brothers who both fall for the same woman and the drama that ensues. In reality, it is more of an anti-war psychological drama exploring the profound effects of war on soldiers and ultimately their families. The acting is superb - especially Toby McGuire - and this movie is anything but a sappy love story about two brothers who fall for the same woman. That would have been trite and in and of itself is more of a side-line in this story. Jake Gyllenhaal kisses Portman once, when she is high, mourning and believing her husband to be dead. They dont have an affair, they dont fall in love and there really is not much of a relationship between them there.     But, there is also not much of a relationship between the two brothers  - played by Gyllenhaal and Maguire - either. They don't act like brothers and friends who have each others' back; the brotherhood which - as the title of the film suggests - is supposed to be so essential to them and their relationship is not really established. They act more like buddies who haven't seen in each other in a while and exchange awkward and polite glances and gestures every now and then. This is one of the issues I had with this move: here we are to believe that these two have a special bond that gets them through the worst of times, but it doesn't naturally follow from the story and the actions of the characters. It feels forced. In other words, if it hadn't said in th script that Gyllenhaal and Maguire are to be brothers, you wouldn't know from their actions that they in fact are.     Gyllenhaal is the outlaw and black sheep of the family who has gotten himself into trouble more times than he can remember - and is accordingly also not very welcome at home - while Maguire plays the beloved son who makes his father proud by having enlisted to bravely fight for his country. Maguire, before he deploys and also later, never has any kind of meaningful conversation with his brother about anything. When he welcomes Gyllenhaal back from prison, he is neither happy nor in any way emotionally touched to see him. As a matter of fact he draws a blank and gives him an awkward look. He never says he loves him no matter what he did and there is no \\"buddy moment\\" between the two.      Natalie Portman plays the devoted, sweeter-than-sugar wife of Tobey Maguire's. She is so perfect and perky, and just beautiful and toned, that you want to poke her with a needle to see if she is real. Don't get me wrong, Portman is a great actress but I think she was seriously miscast for this part. As a mother of two and housewife in a small town she is just not believable. She was totally out of place - both looks wise as well as personality wise. Portman is just too young (or looks too young) to be able to pull off the mommy part. She could have easily played Maguire's teenage sister and would have actually been more believable. Her character also doesn't play the part of the mourning wife who has received devastating news very convincingly. I mean here is this woman who has been told that her husband and the love of her life, is dead, and you never see her crash, you never see her fall apart, you never see her unkempt or out of it or unpretty - she is always together, always pretty. Yes she does cry once when she gets his clothes for someone else, but 5 minutes later, she snaps out of it and is fine again.     The best and most convincing part of the movie is Maguire's emotional melt-down after the horrors he witnessed in the war. That aspect of the story is really what's at the heart of this movie and the most convincing, heartbreaking but also powerful. I loved the depth with which the adverse psychological effects of war were explored and exposed. It was like a slap to the face of all those who somehow glorify and romanticize the notion of going to war and fighting for your country (such as Maguire's father). It dispels the myths that surround war and conquering, with brutal honesty.     Many anti-war movies these days focus on the politics of war and the geopolitical implications of US presence in this fraudulent war in the middle east, but this movie goes right down to the heart of the matter, to the cellular level if you so will, one by one, layer by layer, peeling off and exposing the horrors and dysfunctions that are created when we send young people who have enthusiasm and ideals to fight a war for dubious and questionable political and economic ambitions; a war that crushes their spirit and mind - leaving them emotional, physical and spiritual wrecks for the rest of their lives. While movies like \\"Platoon\\" have already given us a glimpse into the not so romantic side of war, this movie really takes it to a human level, which many people can identify with.     The writers have put their main focus on this aspect and the whole storyline about one brother possibly falling for his brother's wife, seems more like a distraction or sideline (or PR to sell the movie). I think the writers should have either just dropped that storyline altogether or really fleshed it out and explored it - which would have taken this movie down an entirely different path.     Altogether I would say a powerful anti-war movie with substance and fantastic acting.
B000QEIOTO|5.0|I recently purchased 'The Bourne Identity' on HD DVD from Amazon.com. This was my first purchase from Amazon, and I am thouroughly impressed. The item arrived at my house within a couple of days. I bought this item to finish off my Jason Bourne collection on the HD DVD format. Since the HD DVD format is dead, you can pick most HD DVD's up pretty cheap. This purchas was $0.01, plus the $5 or so shipping cost. I highly recommend this seller!
B0037QGRZG|5.0|I have loved this movie ever since watching for the first time as child in the 80's. However, I had held out on adding it to my personal movies collection because the DVD did NOT offer 5.1 sound. WTH?!? So when I saw the Blu Ray for sale (and it has DTS), I jumped at the chance.     The BR video quality is pretty good. Not as good as say The Transformers (Megan Fox in HD! But that's for another review...), but pretty good for a 25 year old movie. The colors and crispness are very good (again, not as good as recent movies). During the scene where Daniel catches the fly with the chopsticks, I can see the fishing line that is holding the fly. Not sure if that's visible in the DVD or not since I did not own it, but it's something I looked for when watching the BR disc.     As previously mentioned, the movie has 5.1 DTS sound which really sounds great. While this is not an action film that has explosions, car chases, etc that really show off the best of 5.1 surround, the 5.1 soundtrack really did add to the movie experience and give it a fuller sound. Watching Daniel go through all the Cobra Kai at the tourney (a 4.0 on the Bill Simmons Vengeance Scale), with the \\"You're the Best!\\" song playing in 5.1 is awesome.     As far as extras, there is a special \\"Blu Pop\\" feature where you can watch the movie with commentary from Ralph Macchio and Billy Zabka and some pop up trivia info. Provides some interesting info about the movie, the characters (you'll hear Zabka explain Martin Kove's perspective on Kreese; Zabka is great during this entire feature), the filming, etc.     Overall, I loved the BR disc and am happy that I held out from buying the DVD. Even though I must've seen this movie about 187 times already (thanks to HBO and Encore and a VHS copy I must've worn out as a kid), viewing #188 was just as good as all but #1.

B00007GZR5|1.0|I had a very hard time trying to get through this movie.  Several times I wanted to turn it off and cough it up as a few dollars lost but struggled through watching it.  I kept thinking... Who wrote this?  Who would take the time and expense to produce this?  Were they all smoking something?  Were they all on drugs?  Do the people who love this movie... is it because at some time in their lives, they've used drugs?  For the SPIRITUAL to have so much PHYSICAL was so ludicrous. You knew what the ending was to be but had to struggle through this absurdity and it was boring.  I think even one star is too high but they don't have a \\"No Star\\" category.    Robin Williams has made some excellent movies and his acting is good in this one but it was all a waste.  This movie DID go to my \\"Not Keeping\\" pile.

B0007TKNCY|1.0|I normally don't write negative reviews, as I don't feel it's worth the time.  This was an exception, as it was rated so highly on AFI's top 100 movies of all time, as well as other lists.  The movie from the beginning was difficult to watch, with Hepburn being extremely off in this role, and Grant having a few good moments.  The script never fully developed, and throughout the movie I kept thinking \\"this has to get better\\".  It was a flop and panned when it came out in the 30's but somehow started to gain popularity to the point that it was selected by the National Film Registry for preservation.  Director Hawks was fired for the film and Hepburn was forced to buy out her contract.  Now it's a \\"revered classic\\".  I think I'm missing something here.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This movie is absolutely exceptional!!  Great story line, great mix of special effects, and absolute tremendous clarity in the picture!  I can't wait to watch it again!!
B0021L9MJG|4.0|\\"Creepshow\\" is a tribute to the old EC comics of the 1950's - there are five stories running almost two hours in total, of weird/macabre and sometimes funny subjects - they really capture the spirit of the EC comics as well as campy slasher films.  There is a lot of star power here - Ted Danson, Ed Harris (both relatively early in their careers), EG Marshall, Stephen King himself, Leslie Nielsen, Hal Holbrook, Adrienne Barbeau, Fritz Weaver, among others, and the movie is as much fun now that i'm 40 as it was when i was 12 (when it came out).  Blu-ray transfer is surprisingly crisp (about as good as this film will probably look); the only real artifacts/flaws i noticed were in the scenes that combine live action with comic book 'borders', but overall, i thought it was a very good transfer.  No extras other than the trailer, which is kinda disappointing, but the disc is pretty affordable and if you haven't seen the film, it's a minor gem (campy makeup & special effects notwithstanding).

Purchasing versus renting is also a good hedge against when they are bound to insert pop-op advertisements into all movies (just my prediction) like they do on cable TV.  If you've never seen the movie, I still recommend it because of it's universal story of lost heroes trying to make their way back home.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|This is clearly the best television show going. To anyone who say this is lacking because of its divergence from the books I would argue the books content is far more mature than anything ABC/Disney will put on air, and the creativity the writers are showing in their own right while sticking to the heart of the series is to be commended.  If you enjoy characters who are \\"human\\" and stories of good's battle against evil, then I truly believe you will enjoy this show.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|Let me preface my review by saying I am not a member of this show's target audience. I'm a 31 year old teacher and mother of 2. However, I LOVE this show. It's addicting! The first few shows played out like a stereotypical CW/WB show, but it quickly developed into a truly great show. Some of the acting may be sub-par, but for the most part, if you go into watching this show looking to have fun, and you commit to a few episodes at least, you'll love it!
0385523386|5.0|Compelling, accurate and incredibly truthful.  Piper was \\"right on\\" about so many facets of the prison system.  I felt she gave the beautifully spirited women a voice and didn't give into the politically correctness that other authors have succumbed to in books.  No fear for her and as they say, \\"there is no argument or explanation for the truth\\".  Thank you for writing this book and sharing your experience.  I believe it will go a long way to those in, out or on their way into the broken, corrupt federal system.
B003102JDM|3.0|Superbly written, acted and directed, yet very, very slow.  Dissertations will be written about A Serious Man but it lacks is what every Jew has; an overt sense of humor.  I found it sly, but never really funny.  There is enormous irony and \\"black\\" humor but at the end of the day, life sucks and then you die.  The final scene with the rabbi is genius, (although my mom wouldn't even understand the reference) but you'll have to slog 90 minutes to get the payoff.  Still, its remarkable and insightful, just not entertaining.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|I am not a fan of Scorsese or DiCaprio, that is not to say that I do not appreciate that they are skilled in their trade, just that I wouldn't get a movie just because it was directed by Scorsese.    I got this movie because of the trailer which I watched on another DVD. It looked compelling.    The film is so exquisitely crafted that after it ends, you continue to think about it and are tempted to watch it again to confirm something you may have missed or wasn't so sure about. If you've seen Secret Window, this is something like that, except better. And that is saying alot because I enjoyed Secret Window immensely.    DiCaprio, as mentioned by another reviewer was great in this movie, he was thoroughly believable. And Ben Kingsley was exceptional, as usual. Dark in this movie - one wouldn't believe he 'was' Ghandi once.    I still haven't made up my mind what happened, and am likely to be watching it again shortly to work out what was real and what was imagined. Somehow I feel there should be a sequel.     If you enjoy psychological Thrillers, I would highly recommend this movie. This is one which is a definite must-get.
B000ZM1MGE|5.0|The DVD Midnight Express was an excellent movie and this DVD certainly does it justice. I was returning from Turkey when this movie was released; if I had seen it before going, I might not have gone. I get chills when I watch this film. This DVD is of good quality and I enjoyed the booklet that came with it.
B002RSDW80|3.0|Meryl Streep is excellent as Julia Child and should have had the entire movie to herself. The attempt to appeal to a younger generation, by adding in an immature blogger named Julie, dragged the film down. Living in NYC, I know all too many narcissistic twentysomethings like Julie, wannabe writers who blog all day about their silly lives and whine, whine, whine. The difference between the lives of Julia and Julie is the difference between a full-bodied French wine, aged to perfection, and a Trader Joe's ten dollar wine, organic, of course. Julia has depth and variety, a hard worker and survivor of the post WWII generation who has known difficult times, fought the sexism of French cooking schools and appreciates all the joy that life has to offer. In contrast, Julie is a child-like, shallow Generation Y blogger in love only with the sound of her own voice, a pampered princess who thinks living in the \\"outer boroughs\\" is akin to a tragedy (too bad she didn't live through WWII) and who can break down in tears over a dropped chicken. She's supposed to turn 30 during the film, but she sounds like she's 20. No wonder the real Julia Child hated her blog (filet mignon doesn't want to be compared to a McDonald's hamburger). Pity Streep has to share her screen time with this silly young thing. If there was ever a movie to turn me off from reading blogs by twenty or thirtysomethings, this is it.
0547260695|5.0|A really poetic instant.  The pop up aren't very spectacular, but they are as may be as Saint Exupery could have love them when he wrote this book.  I am from France, and i missed the french version, that is the reason why i am here !
B00068C7WA|5.0|This is a great album. Greatest hits 1 and 2 and the Essential 2 disc collection give us the unedited, full-length version of all the songs, which is really nice. However, it is nice to hear the edits for a change, and this album gives them to us: the shorter version of Piano Man, taking out about a verse and a half, and the shorter version of All About Soul gives us the great guitar work that is not in the original recording. I also like the version of My Life, its a little more rocking and moving without the high piano notes coming in until the very end and fewer piano measures between the verses. My favorite Billy Joel edited song, however, is I Go To Extremes. When i was a kid and the song came out on the radio, it pretty much had the first rocking piano solo, followed by 2 lines of singing, then the second piano solo (which rocks even more). At the end of the second solo, it goes back to Billy singing and the song fading out. I have tried to find this everywhere to get onto my ipod along with the great original recording and have been unable to find it anywhere. I figured when this album came out and I read about the edited versions that I Go To Extremes would defintiely be on there. It isn't :(    But the rest of the album is great stuff :)
B002VPE1B6|4.0|I love this movie. Great quality. Only negative is there's no extras on the disc.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|This is really incredible CD that brings you back to another time in music.  James Taylor and Carole King sound fabulous together.  I hope a new generation of music listeners takes the opportunity to enjoy such great artists.  It is a real treat that they put this album out together.<br />[[ASIN:B0019HBVFQ Voice Lessons To Go v.1-4 The Complete Set]]
B002UNMWAG|5.0|Almost as good as the first.  As sequels go this ranks up there with the highest.  Get this movie.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|Wow i wasnt expected something this beautiful and deep, i heard the song kick with a fist on the radio and liked it but the whole cd is a masterpiece, the lyrics, the melodies, and most of all her voice. You will feel you are being transported somewhere far and magical, and a sense of melancoly invades you too, but hopefully songs like kiss with a fist and hurricane drunk will cheer you up a little.<br />LOVEEED THE MUSIC, LOVED THE BAND, LOVED HER!!!!!!!!! i cant stop playing it over and over again.
0307454541|5.0|The first book in the series\\" The girl who played with fire\\" took a while to hook me, but after the first hundred pages I found it hard to put down. With this book, I was  hooked from the very beginning. The Girl With The Dragon Tatto, is a well paced, and entertaining read. This is also the type of a book, in which I will put it on the shelf, only to pull it out in the not to distant future for a second go round. Like a great movie, I am sure that I will find many things which I missed, the first time around.
0061906220|5.0|I sent Pete the Cat: I Love My White Shoes to my 3-year-old grandson who absolutely loves this book.  The story, repetition, graphics, and bold colors are brilliant!  Aidan and his siblings (6 and 8) also love telling the story and singing along as they watch the author perform this on Utube.
B000002HHB|5.0|I really enjoyed this CD. The more I play it , the more I become hooked. I remember first hearing it many years ago, at a friends house, and was surprized how great the lyrics to her music were. What surprizes me many years later is that this music, from the 90's has aged so well.
B00005AREQ|5.0|I saw Jeff Beck in concert few weeks and realized that i had never seen anything quite like my whole life.<br />The guy is fast, but there are many fast guitarists.<br />The guys is a bluesman, but there's plenty of other bluesmen.<br />And yet, Jeff Beck is something absolutely special. when you see walking on stage, you understand why--he needs to position himself in a way that allows him to send the guitar in feedback and do things that nobody has ever done.<br />He makes use of the electricity and sound waves to create sounds that nobody had ever conceived before he did.<br />Blow by Blow, which is Jeff Beck's best known album, showcases Jeff Beck's guitar genius at his best.<br />When I hear his version of 'we ended as lovers', i always hope he had recorded a 25 minute version of it. Jeff Beck is so good in that song, that you kind of wish that he played it longer: 5 minutes is not enough, 10 minutes would not have been enough, that's we would have needed a 25 minute recording.<br />Jeff Beck is more than a guitar hero, he's an innovator and musical genius--this is what Blow by Blow is all about. and i love it.
0439023491|5.0|When I read a series, the first book is always my favorite. However, Catching Fire - the sequel to The Hunger Games - just broke that trend. This book was an unbelievable, unpredictable novel that is on the top of the list for one of my favorite books. Ever.<br /><br />The novel picks up from where The Hunger Games left off, with Katniss returning to her home in district 12 as victor. She is well-known worldwide, and pretty soon starts hearing rumors that she might be causing rebellions throughout Panem. One day, the intimidating President Snow visits Katniss and what he tells her leaves her frightened for her own life and the lives of all her loved ones. To add to the plot, the 75th Hunger Games are approaching and the Capital has decided to change a few rules...<br /><br />The book is split into three parts: The victory tour through the 12 districts, preparing and training for the 75th Hunger Games, and inside the arena for the games themselves. My favorite part would have to be the latter because so many important, nail-biting events happened.<br /><br />Even though I wish the story could've taken place actually inside the arena more, the action was non-stop and almost each chapter ended with a fantastic cliff hanger! The read was thrilling and exhilarating, very enjoyable.<br /><br />I was deeply absorbed in Katniss's character, and the way she was beautifully written. Just like in the first book, I felt like I was with her throughout the entire novel - specifically in the arena. I could literally feel her pain, even more so than during the first book, since I knew her character so well and everything she had been through. While Katniss was torn between her love for Gale or Peeta, it made my heart ache, too.<br /><br />Another thing I really liked about Katniss's character was the way she was so realistic! Even though the novel is set in the future, Katniss was just like any other female teenager. She had her fair share of random mood swings, like most adolescent girls do. But another thing that got brought to my attention was her human instinct while trying to survive in the Hunger Games arena. Even though she continuously was determined to put Peeta's life before her own, there were split seconds when her human instinct would slip through and she'd want to save herself instead. At first, I was thinking that it was kind of selfish, but then I realized - hey, even the most humble people probably have times like these. You can't really help it, you're only human!<br /><br />I loved how Katniss's mockingjay was the symbol for the rebellions. The mockingjay played a tremendous role in the story, and showed up during many parts. Hence the cover - which I love by the way. The subtle message of politics and symbolism was a nice touch in the novel and I liked how it wasn't \\"in your face\\", like some books are.<br /><br />I found myself actually talking outloud during some chapters, or yelling at the idiotic President Snow. That's just how much this terrific story will suck you in. You will seriously feel like you are in the book. It made me want to pick up a weapon and join the fight!<br /><br />I am on the edge of my seat, very anxious for the third book in the series to be published. I've never been so excited for a book to come out, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to wait until fall 2010 when it's released! Suzanne Collins is now on my list for favorite authors. :)t girls do.

014241543X|2.0|Mia has a wonderful life: extraordinary and loving family, a genuine boyfriend who loves her, an extreme talent at playing the cello, and a loyal best friend. But during a snowy morning, all that changes. She and her family experience a tragic car crash, and Mia is the only one left alive - just barely. Machines at the hospital are keeping her alive, but it will be her decision whether to keep or let go of life. In the course of exactly one day, Mia relives past memories with her loved ones, while hearing what they have to say to her while she's in a coma. It's a decision she'll have to make on her own.<br /><br />Hmm...interesting book. It was told mostly in flashbacks, to show the significance of the friends and family that visited Mia in the hospital. The writing was alright - had difficulty sometimes visualizing what was going on. I liked the overall storyline, it was cool reading about Mia being stuck between life and death, but it wasn't screaming creativity. There were a couple funny statements in the book, but it felt out of place since the setting of the book was really depressing.<br /><br />The basic theme of the story was well portrayed and it was interesting seeing how Mia changed through the course of one day. Her boyfriend goes to extreme measures in order to see her, which I thought was unrealistically sweet. However, even though the story is told in first person, the characters seemed sort of detached. I didn't fall in love with any particular character, or despise another; they seemed to mix in with one another, no one really leaving a mark on me.<br /><br />I think there was a lot of missing substance in the book, it needed more \\"meat\\". Mia's whole family is DEAD...she's a freakin orphan - yet she barely even lets that faze her. She's too concerned with other thoughts involving her boyfriend or bestfriend, etc. I think the story would have been more realistic and heart-wrenching if the author had actually spent time showing Mia's heartache or breakdown of her terrible loss. There was almost no emotion.<br /><br />One thing I did love about the book though, was how the author incorporated music in it. Mia's punk-rock and quirky parents were what I enjoyed reading about, and I recognized some of the classical pieces that Mia plays on her cello. Overall, it was a quick and semi-enjoyable read. It wasn't dreadful, but definitely not a favorite either.ss. There was almost no emotion.    One thing I did love about the book though, was how the author incorporated music in it.

0385523386|5.0|Out of Piper Kerman's youthful mistake comes a very important and well-written book.  Many of us can rattle off stats about the growth in the prison population from around 350,000 three decades ago to 2.3 million today.  But who are these people?  Thank God that Piper Kerman ignored her lawyer's advice and went ahead and made friends in prison, so that we could come to know these women, too.  How is it that a country with 5% of the world's population has 25% of its prisoners, most of whom are incarcerated for non-violent offenses?  We need to systematically turn this around by legalizing marijuana, promoting harm reduction and rehab strategies for more serious drugs, and implementing restorative justice for more serious crimes so that criminals can compensate their victims and learn to be productive members of society.  Thank you, Piper, for raising our awareness with this timely book.
1416955070|5.0|Clary Fray, an overall normal teenager living in New York, witnesses a murder one night at a club. Except that no else can seem to see the things and people that she sees. From there, Clary's world takes off on an adventure full of shadow hunters (descendants of angels that kill demons), warlocks, vampires, werewolves, and many other paranormal creatures. Along the way, she'll have the help from the charming Jace, and learn about all of the dark secrets of her past that her mother never told her about.<br /><br />I don't want to say much about the plot, because I really don't want to give anything away! This book is full of surprises and there are many twists and turns along the way that were very unpredictable. The story kicks off strong, and has so many intense scenes along the way, you almost never have time to wind down and breathe.<br /><br />I fell in love with Clary and Jace's characters; they're the protagonists in the book, and their more-than-just-friends relationship was really believable and interesting. Sure, Clary sometimes made stupid decisions, or craved comfort and protection, but that's what made it so much more real! Jace's witty and sarcastic personality drew me in right away, yet somewhere deep within him there's a sensitive and caring boy.<br /><br />Now for the storyline....wow. Even though the main plot in the book was for Clary and the other Shadow Hunters to retrieve the Mortal Cup from the villain, Valentine; there are some side plots to the story too, that will keep up the reader's attention. It was a thrilling read, and there were nights that I would stay up reading for hours simply because I couldn't put the book down! It's a really unique and creative story, and I hadn't read anything like it before. The author's writing was so believable and understandable, and I could easily visualize everything that was happening. She didn't hesitate to include many details in her writing.<br /><br />This is one of the longest books I've ever read though. It's almost 500 pages, and for me being a slow reader, it took me what felt like forever to finally finish it. But it was definitely worth it. This ending will have you shocked like never before. My fingers are itching to hold the next book and being reading it. Why did I wait so long to start reading this fantastic series?!d for me being a slow reader, it took me what felt like forever to finally finish it. But it was definitely worth it.

B002ZG98VE|1.0|No character development, no decent plots, just a boring movie. I fell asleep twice during fight scenes. This movie had good actors, but a really boring script and plot.... Don't waste your money... I haven't seen a movie this bad since 9th gate, and honestly I'd rather see that again than be forced to watch Robin Hood again.
B002KAJ0AO|5.0|This Is Us. Where do I start? First off, I'm listening to it right as I type this and....I can't believe how out of the loop I was. I didn't know BSB had a new album until I was on here looking for older ones. I'm EVER so glad that I found this though. I immediately got it, and I DO NOT REGRET it at ALL. I've been a BSB fan, so yes, this is different for them, but you all can't expect them to do 1999-style music in 2010. They were VERY efficient in making this album and keeping it up to date with what's being heard today. I don't skip over ANY track, because all of them are just amazing to me in their own way. My top favorites have to be:    Bye Bye Love  She's A Dream  If I Knew Then  Undone  Bigger    I think the whole album might be my favorite. You have to give credit where credit is due....and this is definitely not a pop album, I didn't feel pop, it was more R&B, Hip-Hop and I like that they ventured off into these genres without losing themselves too much. Come on BSB fans, don't sell this one short, you should be glad that it's different. Very awesome that they're still making music, would've loved for Kevin to be apart of it as well.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|This is a fantastic film. Very entertaining and unique.  The preview does not do this film justice.  George Clooney is at his best and adds a level of sophistication to strangely animated this stop-motion film.  The writing is crisp, funny and engaging to all ages.  The side-characters and performances are superb.  This film is perfect for adults of all ages and kids of most ages, probably 10+ is safe. It's rare to find a film so perfectly amusing for kids and adults.  This film is a gem. Great characters, great writing, great story, great themes.  I think everyone would enjoy this film... it's one of the best.
B002WY65VU|4.0|this film isnt for everyone, its has gore that  almost qualifies it as exploitation, but still. it has a pretty  funny moments, good acting, great cameo by bill murray and  the possibility of a sequel.Now to be honest , not alot actually happens in the entire film, but  still, its definitly worth a look.Recommended
B000FGFUMM|5.0|This version of Countdown to Extinction is well worth the money for those who enjoy the benefits of quality recordings.  For Megadeth fans I would say this is a must have if you don't have a turntable and are unable to listen to the vinyl version of this album.  This re-master brings out the bass not present in the original recording on compact disc.  It also cleans up the drum kit a bit.  Although Megadeth's albums are generally better produced than most metal albums they still sound a bit compressed and recorded to loud to these ears.  The compressed sound is not present on this version.  On audiophile equipment this disc can put Dave Mustaine in your living room.  Even on mass market audio equipment as well as higher end \\"boom boxes\\" this disc as well as other Mobile Fidelity offerings sound much better than the original releases.  In this case, this tops the 2004 re-master as well.  Recommended.
B0008ENICU|5.0|Let's see if you can identify this property:  a gaggle of upscale, high maintenance women, mostly married to men with deep pockets.    They lunch, they shop, they attend fashion shows, they dish. They form brief, musical chairs type alliances within the group.  They diss each other and often the husbands as well.      They discuss their respective issues and sometimes appear supportive of each other, often disingenuously.  One relies on her sage like mother for advice  They go to spas to be pampered and pummeled.  They work out to stay fit and desirable.   They wear cutting edge a la mode everything.    Simply watching them rail and flail within their small milieu is ensorcelling verging on addictive.    And, did I mentioned among them there is a from the wrong side of the tracks unscrupulous wannabe?    Name the property.    Did you guess the Real Housewives of Hither and Yon?  New York?  New Jersey?    Well, no wonder.  The work in question, though fiction,  might well have been produced last week and a part of that franchise!      Meaning,  comments about the work being stale, outdated,  even anachronistic....if you see what is there, must be coming from critics lacking discernment and perspective.    Thing is, this work was produced SEVENTY years ago.     The property is The Women.  The original (the only one worth seeing), written by the Moxie-endowed, razor keen Claire Booth Luce and directed by one of the finest women's' directors who ever set foot on a set, George Cukor.  And that, according to every actress he ever directed.    Ah, the halcyon days of MGM, and in a year considered to this day,  marked by an almost embarrassing  excess of brilliant movies: 1939.  It's still  considered Hollywood's Greatest Year.    The Women is populated by an all star, all female cast whose ages span several decades.    Each luminary delivers an unforgettable performance, most notably,  the deliciously manic Rosalind Russell  at her rat-a-tat finest.    Costumes by Adrian...you bet, late 30s a la mode, and get that fashion changes and that is usually driven by commerce.   So, make sure your vision is not stuck in Prada & D & G.  Aspiring to be au courant has no circa, after all.    When I first saw this film on TV way back, I thought the premise that women ought be blindly devoted to their men was the fly in the cinematic ointment rendering this movie pre Feminist archaic.      I was wrong. Incredibly, not a lot has changed, as per what we see via the reality shows in question.    Norma Shearer plays the initially stoic lead opposite her nemesis, Joan Crawford, who, using faux sexuality, is out to steal Ms. Shearer's husband for his money.  These two were actual rivals at MGM back in the day.  Ms. Crawford,  who, in this film plays herself, addressing why Ms. Shearer's light eclipsed her own stardom at Metro, hurled,  \\"Well, she sleeps with the boss.\\"    Indeed.  Ms. Shearer married the creatively brilliant, but physically fragile Irving Thalberg.  They had two kids together before he died far too young.    The characters depicted in The Women are no more caricatures than those individuals we see in The Real Housewives franchise.     If you are lucky enough to buy this movie, you will be taken aback by its timelessness if you work to see things in perspective.      Not to mention, you will be captivated and entertained...and perhaps even moved to ponder social mores and gender roles---and even if monogamy is indigenous to our species (we are not beavers, after all)---by some of the best who ever were.
1601251505|5.0|There are enough reviews here if you need details on this monster sized book, but I want to highlight what makes this a must by for RPG players who remember that D&D was founded on wargaming and not computer gaming.<br /><br />1) The game mechanics are superior.  Yes, every class except Wizard seems to get a big amp-up in Pathfinder, but not to the point where you lose the original flavor of D&D back when it came in a white box.<br /><br />2) You can convert a character from 3.5 with ease, in effect allowing a character created in the 1st edition of the game to be converted into Pathfinder, an event simply impossible in 4th edition.<br /><br />3) The text is clearer. Small fixes abound, resulting in a much cleaner game functionality.<br /><br />5) The price is fair. At 500+ pages, many with full color art, the price point is better than any RPG out there.<br /><br />6)The game itself remain complicated enough to require actual thinking but not so cumbersome as to be hard to explain.  The layout is nicely done.<br /><br />Just another satisfied customer saying -- Thank God for Pathfinder.  True Lineage to D&D may force you to play under another name, but the feel is right.<br /><br />Kudos.
B000AMJC2K|4.0|Bought this for my Apple 23\\" HD Display. Because of Apple's design this required an Apple VESA adapter for the display to mate with the VESA mount supplied with the Ergotron, which is capable, by way of an included adapter plate, of matching either a 75mm or 100mm mount. Graphic instructions were easy to understand.  Assembly was easy, all parts and tools were included.  The base is capable of grommet mount or edge mount.  Negatives: a) The plastic clips on the arm were not capable of retaining the cables and I had to purchase velcro cable ties to use instead.  b) Downward adjustment is more limited than I would have liked as I prefer a lower monitor position than this arm is capable of.  Overall, however, I would buy this again, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good, moveable, flexible monitor support arm.
B001I0T92Q|2.0|I've had this adapter for about a year using it in my PSP. I used two 8GB MicroSD cards. For long time it worked great, but then one day my data just disappeared after exiting a game. Lucky I was able to recover some of my data. After that I started to be more careful, so I always made sure to use the \\"Safely Remove Hardware\\" function in Windows. Even doing that my data disappeared AGAIN a week after the first time. And today (5-15-2010) about 2 months after that second data loss, it did it AGAIN FOR THE THIRD TIME!!!<br /><br />So if you enjoy making regular backups and waiting hours for recovery software to restore your data, then this is the adapter for you, otherwise just buy a real Memory Stick Pro Duo. I wish I could go back and just saved up for a real 16GB Memory Stick.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers gave me insight to the conditions my father endured during WWII and never spoke of or complained about.  My father served in the Army Corp of Engineers during WWII and landed in LeHarve, France near Normandy. He never talked about the war until late in his life.     Band of Brothers is a history lesson brought to life that made me sad, proud, and empathic to all the men and women who fought in that war. Hanks and Spielberg tell a mesmerizing story that makes you anxiously await the next chapter. The sadness comes when you think of the reality of Band of Brothers and the loss of so many lives and the human suffering.    For me, it brings a realization for some of the things my father did and the paths that he chose after he returned from war.    My father-in-law served in the Marine Corp during WWII in Tarawa.  He stil carries a bullet lodged in his shoulder as a reminder. In watching the Pacific by Hanks and Spielberg it has met the expectation set by Band of Brothers and maybe exceeded it.
B00004R7TP|5.0|For anyone who thinks I only disparage things on Amazon......    Back in the day, when I first saw the video for Running up the Hill, I scoffed at it. Kate Bush was too girly for me. I was punk. But then I succumbed to the drivign 'wall of percussion' of 'Running' and was drawn in. That single is song number one on the album, and what a surprise it was to find that all that follows is of astonishingly high quality, a labor of love. I always found the album to be an interesting listen. Eventually I came to respect the whole effort quite a bit, and now it can easily be said; this is a great, seminal work of the 80s, the peak of Kate Bush's career. My respect for this album has only grown, as new singers like Tori Amos borrowed and built on Kate Bush's persona. Over twenty five years I continue to stumble across the references hidden in these songs; (i.e. Kate was trying to make us inerested in the life, odd ideas and persecution of William Reich). The album  is inhabited by untold multitudes of femininity.    This album is now a deeply-respected milestone, a classic. I didn't know when I was buying it that this was no t just another album I'd tire of and forget. These songs haunt and inspire me almost 30 years later. While doing my laundry today I caught myself humming, then singing:  \\"Motherrr ...stands for COMfort  MoTHER will.. hide the madman  M0therrrr ...stands for comfort  MoTHER will... staaaaay mum\\"    Kate Bush associated herself with Peter Gabriel, a decent songsmith who eventually dissolved under tepid, generic world-music urges.
1597801585|1.0|I don't get the modern SF \\"steampunk\\" genre. Does no one else find it improbable and ridiculous that a future society would have the means to produce humanoid robots but not the means to improve on 19th century power sources? It's like the entire genre was based on an episode of \\"The Wild, Wild West.\\" It's a stupid idea that informs every new SF book I've tried to read in recent years.     Another thing I don't get: books with italicized foreign words and phrases on almost every page. The author seems to be trying to impress us with his knowledge of a different language and culture, at the expense of our understanding. In the first seven pages, I stumbled over \\"bai, khap, zou ba, chapatis, kopi, fa' gan,\\" and \\"farang.\\" It goes on and on like that, page after page. I read SF for entertainment, not as a foreign language study guide.    I also could not figure out who the characters were, what they were doing, or how they related to the story. They were all just part of a dystopian miasma that was both unlikely and boring.     I've had it with modern SF; I'm going to re-read Foundation. And you kids get off my lawn.     Update based on comments:    Looks like I've riled up the cognoscenti. The ad hominem attacks are flying. Could it be that my comments aren't entirely recherche? Or that my criticisms are de trop?     Nah.    For more foreign words and phrases, see Mark Twain's \\"A Tramp Abroad,\\" chapter 30.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Martin isn't affraid to let events unfold as brutally as they need to.  No character is safe just because he's built it up and made you love it.  The result is that you truly hate the villans for hurting and killing much beloved characters, and there is a real feeling of tension and fear as they find themselves in peril.  I can usually tell when a character in a novel is, for all intents and purposes &#34;invincible&#34;, but I have been wrong many times in this series.    If there is a problem with this book it is that it sort of drags on a little towards the end.  I found myself getting a little bored precisely when I should have been the most engaged.  Also, there is no real end to the story.  I know it's a trilogy, and so I didn't  really expect everything to be resolved, but it almost felt like the story could have kept on going and someone just arbitrarily decided to stop at the end of th elast chapter.  Luckily I can go on to the next book now.  If read this before the last book had come out, I would be very dissapointed.  These are small gripes.  I gave it 4 stars just because I didn't think it was quite as good as the first.    A very satisfying and involving read.
B002HXR542|2.0|I should know better.  I always avoid dubs. While I recall recently seeing a dubbed movie that was quite surprising, it wasnt this one.<br />When dubbing is this bad, it is really hard to say if the movie had any merits, IMO.
B001OQCV6A|1.0|I'm sixteen year old great fan of the Sherlock Holmes films with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce made in the late thirties and mid-forties. I cannot begin to relate to you how HORRIBLE this movie was! As mentioned by a previous reviewer, all of a sudden, Holmes and Dr. Watson have been transformed into two gorgeous, younger guys who know how to kick butt. I also must say that this is an exceptionally dumbed-down portrayal of the classic stories of Sir Aurthur Conan Doyle, so that even the most pinheadded people could understand the plot. The classic characters created by Sir Aurthur Conan Doyle have been turned into twenty-first century smart alec twits. In the beginning of the movie, I felt it was very intellectually stimulating, then it just got dumber and dumber... This movie was definitely aimed toward the younger generation. This movie also utterly lacks subtlety and suspense that the older movies had. And don't even get me started on the quality of acting! I COULDN'T EVEN WATCH THIS MOVIE ALL THE WAY THROUGH BECAUSE I COULDN'T TAKE HOW SUB-PAR IT WAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    This was certainly not cracked up as it was supposed to be. I have read all of Sir Aurthur Conan Doyle's stories of Sherlock Holmes. And then my love of classic movies brought me to find the old film series with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. This new movie can't hold a candle to the brilliant acting of the classic pair, the complex plots, the intellectually stimulating and suspenseful atmosphere, the exquisite camerawork and the overall excellence of the classic Rathbone and Bruce film series. I admit that I am faithful to the old films, but even if I weren't I would still say this movie sucked.    Honestly, don't waste your time with this movie... it was almost three hours of my life that I can never get back!

030726839X|5.0|Churchill brought to life. Amidst the huge array of Churchill works,many of which I have read,why would I eagerly anticipate another? Due to the never failing ability of Max Hasting's to inject immediacy,relevance and the sense of the person into subjects so overwritten as to become almost numbingly iconic. I am midway through the work and am not disappointed,in fact rate it five stars. Churchill brought to life, with no erasure of his shortcomings but on the contrary their overcoming futher  testament to his stature as he faced the 'fog of war\\",the futility of appeasing fanatic ideology,the politics of opportunism and the vagaries of the public will.He was both \\"the hedgehog and the fox\\" to use Isaiah Berlin's apt but usually mutually exclusive distinction.One wonders if such a gargantuan personna could emerge again or is world or national cataclysm the required dynamic? Recent events do not provoke optimism.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|Hello,       I see by many earlier reviews there was great concern over the original packaging of this set. This review addresses that issue only.         I recently bought the new repackaged complete Battlestar series and found the packaging to be perfect. Each DVD comes in its own plastic case. The plastic case is durable and made of good quality and has a brief description of the specific episodes on the back to help you locate the specific episode look are looking for. Each of the four seasons the show ran has its own box that contain the DVDs for that season. Example -5 DVDs in the season 1 box. The box for season 4 also has the DVDs for season 4.5 for a total of 8 DVDs inside.      I understood that the original complete series main box was large and ackward and didn't well well into normal shelf space. The 4 season boxes all fit perfectly ( not too tight or too loose) into one sturdy main box. So it is easy to remove an individual seasons while leaving the other three seasons inside. The main box that contains everything is 8 inches high by 8 inches wide by 5.75 deep.         So you don't buy the wrong set here's how to recognize the original package from the new and greatly improved package. The new package is gray and has the 5 principle characters on the front. It also has 3 secondary characters on each side. The back of the box is where you remove the 4 individual season boxes.         My guess is that the head honcho at Univeral saw all the negative remarks on the poor packaging of the original set and kicked some butt. \\"Do it right\\" is probably what he (or she) demanded and they did. Hopefully this new, complete series, packaging will become the industry standard.
0060567503|2.0|This definitely feels to me like there were a few good ideas puffed up with lots of words and air to make a longer book.  Anyone who needs this info doesn't need all that storytelling and wants the info in the most effective form not in some long drawn-out storyline.  It also feels like it was a set-up for more books at big prices to present info that could have been presented effectively in one book.  I am very glad I got this out of my local library instead of buying it!
0312330537|4.0|This book was good enough to get me through 900+ pages, which is an accomplishment, because I simply don't read that many books. I think the biggest appeal is for Westerners like myself to enjoy a band new world. Like Pandora. Or Hogwarts. Exotic places, interesting people, great adventures.     However, rather than concentrate on the positives, this review will defend against the negatives. I think the negative reviewers have a few things right: reading his prose, it's just like he's trying to hard. It also just doesn't seem all that believable for all these things to happen to one guy. I mean I'm sure there are people in the world who get into knife fights alot, and know and practice karate, but I think they probably think it's a big deal when it happens. Anyway you get the point - in the story he's a tough guy with a heart of gold, and everybody loves him, everything about him is sympathetic- the correct term i'm seeing is self-aggrandizing.    I think all that can be forgiven though, he actually seems like someone I might know in real life, who had this happen to him. So he should tell his story, but I don't know that I should be expecting him to be Mark Twain. As far the self-aggrandizement goes, well, i think most people in the world are self-deluded, why not him? It isn't too annoying, and keeps the story moving. The guy actually did go to prison, I don't think sensitive emo personalities survive there too well.    In the end, the story is well worth the read. There's action, humor, heartbreak, philosophy, history, relation to current events, a lot of great stuff here.
1439148953|2.0|Eilis Lacey, the nominal heroine of this book recalls to mind a famous quote from the movie \\"As Good as it Gets.\\"  When Jack Nicholson is asked how he is able to portray women so accurately in his romance novels, he replies \\"I think of a man, and I take away reason and accountability.\\"     The best literature lets the reader in on the hopes, dreams, and thoughts of its characters.  Eilis, however, doesn't appear to have any hopes or dreams of her own.  In her village in Ireland, her life is run by her mother, sister, and friends.  When an American priest convinces her mother and sister that Eilis' prospects would be better in Brooklyn, the matter is settled without any input from Eilis herself.  On the boat over to America, she follows the lead of her cabin mate.  Once in Brooklyn, she follows the life set out for her by the priest, her landlady, and her employer.  Her only independent act, finding herself a boyfriend, merely results in adding one more person to help run her life.    When circumstances bring her back to Ireland for a visit, she finds that a job and a boyfriend have been arranged for her there, as well. This sets up the book's big dramatic conflict. Will she choose to go back to America or stay in Ireland?  Of course, it doesn't much matter, since in either place she will only be pursuing the life planned out for her by others.  But as it turns out, Eilis doesn't even get to make this meaningless decision on her own, as once again, circumstances decide for her.    The best literature fully grounds the reader in a particular time and place, but Eilis doesn't seem to be rooted anywhere.  Coming to America would for most people be an exciting, life-altering experience, but no Eilis.  In America, as in Ireland, her life is taken up mostly by work and school.  The few entertainments she pursues, parish dances, trips to the beach, and movies, are exactly the same as those she pursued in Ireland.  Although she lives a short subway ride away from one of thegreat cities of the world, Eilis only goes into Manhattan once, and finds it almost indistinguishable from Brooklyn.  She can hardly be blamed, however.  In this book, every place appears to be indistinguishable from every other. Although the book is said to be set in 1951, there are only the barest of references to current events (television, her store catering to African American clientele) to let the reader know what era the story is set in.    It's a rare thing for me to read a book and find myself wishing by the end that the protagonist would just get hit by a bus and be put out of her misery, but that's what happened when I read \\"Brooklyn\\" Reader, be warned!

B002ZG97RE|2.0|What a huge disappointment.  Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon are an outstanding team when it comes to the Bourne series.  In Green Zone they try to take that same formula and use an important issue like \\"Why we went to war\\" as a PLOT POINT.  Not only does it cheapen the entire film but the characters are all cookie cutter and the dialogue is even more cliche.  Add on top of that the director's usual frenzied, handheld style during action scenes (which usually works) but here it's almost impossible to tell what's going on.<br /><br />What a waste of talent across the board.  Even Matt Damon's character has NO CHARACTER.  He's just some random rogue agent whose gone \\"off the reservation.\\"  Why has he done this? Why now?<br /><br />Basically, this is a lousy grade Z screenplay that they tried to cover up with A grade talent and it ends up being boring, insulting and disappointing.  Regardless of your politics, you'd be better off watching any of the Bourne movies again unless you put this on during a rainy Sunday and nod off to the non-stop nothingness on the couch.<br /><br />Epic fail.
B00006EXL5|4.0|This is the album that has made many converts of those used to hate MCR but now love them. \\"Bullets\\" is just a really aggressive album that is almost impossible not to like. The majority of the songs on the album are incredible and the only two songs I don't care for are the last two on the album. That is the only reason this record didn't score a perfect five-star score from me. If you have any doubts about if MCR can rock, then this album is something that you have to listen to.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|Shorn of its C-G special effects -- which mostly look like a second-rate computer game -- this is one of the most hackneyed movies in movie history. Part poor man's \\"Alien,\\" it is bursting with cliched characters speaking some of the tritest dialogue ever recorded. Whoever wrote it must have watched too much \\"CSI\\" on the long journey to Pandora.

B000ZINGIK|4.0|Avantasia is a rock opera project composed and put together by vocalist Tobias Sammet of Edguy. The first Avantasia releases with the title 'The Metal Opera' featured numerous guest musicians from the power metal scene and are regarded as some of the best modern power metal albums.  &#34;The Scarecrow&#34; was released in 2008 and became one of the twenty best selling albums in Europe. The music and atmosphere of the album was different when compared to previous Avantasia releases. This fact alienated some old fans but also attracted new ones. The music on The Scarecrow leaned more towards hard rock, rather than power metal and the guest musicians involved came from various musical genres. All in all, The Scarecrow is a monumental album, with great songwritting and some outstanding vocal performances.  The main musicians, who are featured on all tracks, are Tobias Sammet on bass and lead vocals, Sascha Paeth (ex-Heaven's Gate) on guitars and Eric Singer (Kiss) on drums. Guest musicians include Henjo Richter (Gamma Ray), Kai Hansen (ex-Helloween, Gamma Ray) and Rudolf Schenker (Scorpions).  The cast of guest vocalists features several big names from both rock and metal. Alice Cooper, Jorn Lande (ex-Ark, Masterplan), Michael Kiske (ex-Helloween, Place Vendome), Roy Khan (Kamelot), Bob Catley (Magnum), Oliver Hartmann (ex-At Vance) and Amanda Somerville (Aina).  The music can be described as bombastic, epic and varied, covering everything from hard rock, power metal, heavy metal, soft rock, pop rock and ballads. The instrumental portion of the album is exceptional, featuring memorable guitar riffs, excellent guitar solo battles and solid drumming. The vocal performances vary from truly outstanding to acceptable.  The best song on offer is surely the over 10 minute, epic title track. &#34;The Scarecrow&#34; starts with a Celtic intro, brakes into hard rock territory, contains slow and faster tempo moments and features a symphonic passage as well. The song's chorus is really strong and addictive, the vocal battle between Tobias Sammet and Jorn Lande is amazing and there is also a long guitar solo before the majestic finale. Jorn Lande's vocals truly stand out; as he delivers a wonderful David Coverdale meets Ronnie James Dio performance. Michael Kiske also appears, towards the end, singing some higher notes in the background. A definite highlight and one of the best songs Sammet has ever composed!  &#34;Shelter From The Rain&#34; is another strand out track and the fastest song on offer. The song carries an old Helloween vibe and features some of Eric Singer's most impressive drum work, both Henjo Richter and Kai Hansen on lead guitars and Sammet, Michael Kiske and Bob Catley on vocals. It includes a melodic and epic intro, fast double bass drumming, an amazing high pitched vocal performance by Kiske, a shining chorus, an outstanding guitar battle between Hansen and Richter and a fitting hard rock passage with a great Catley.  &#34;The Toy Master&#34; is a track sang by Alice Cooper and the only song containing a minimal vocal performance by Sammet. The song starts with an eerie atmosphere and soon kicks into a memorable and strong hard rock mode. The song is played in mid tempo, contains an acceptable performance by Cooper, a nice chorus, excellent guitar solos, a great bridge with strong riffing and a power metal climax.  &#34;Another Angel Down&#34; is a somewhat typical power metal tune, featuring a strong vocal performance by both Lande and Sammet. Nice guitar leads, a memorable guitar battle and an uplifting chorus round off the track perfectly.  &#34;Twisted Mind&#34; is the album's opener and another strong tune. It begins very effectively, with a wall of heavy guitar riffs, contains some great guitar melodies and carries a dark atmosphere. Roy Khan sings together with Sammet, providing a fitting vocal performance to the songs mood. The chorus is nice but nothing mindblowing, while the track drags a little towards the end.Some of the remaining songs are also good, but not to the extent of the aforementioned ones. &#34;Devil In The Belfry&#34; is a catchy up-tempo track which starts nicely, contains good vocals by Lande, but its plagued by an unfitting and unimpressive chorus. &#34;Cry Just A Little&#34; is an average acoustic ballad, while &#34;I Don't Believe In Your Love&#34; is a mediocre rocker with nice guitar work. The remaining songs are the softer pop-rock tracks &#34;Carry Me Over&#34; and &#34;Lost in Space&#34;, sang entirely by Sammet and the pop ballad &#34;What Kind Of Love&#34; with the female vocalist Amanda Somerville. These three tracks, while not terrible, damage the flow of the album and feel out of place. (There is a much better 'extended version' of the song Lost in Space, featured on The Lost In Space part1&2 album, with Michael Kiske on vocals and an added guitar solo)  Overall a strong album and the first part of &#34;The Wicked Trilogy&#34; concept, which was completed in 2010 with the release of two new albums. When compared to its sequels, The Wicked Symphony and Angel Of Babylon, The Scarecrow is probably weaker and more uneven compared to the second album; due to some weak songs, the fact that Sammet gets the lion's share of the vocals and the absence of continuity between the tracks. Still a memorable album with some great tracks and amazing vocals.  (Be sure to check out 'The Wicked Symphony' and 'Angel Of Babylon')
B001DF68MA|5.0|We bought this item first before buying a bicycle to make sure it would fit. We bought a Schwinn Protocol 1.0 from Amazon (great bike) and this fit perfectly. The front of the bar is smaller on the area that goes around the gooseneck, so it will fit most bikes (I think).    We have an 18 month old girl, and she fits into the wee ride perfectly. We have ridden around out neighborhood for about a month now. The product was easy to assemble, and was perfect out of the box. Since we leave the bike outside, we remove the seat each time we use it. The harness works but gets a little twisted. The snaps are fine, and getting her in and out is no issue. She loves to hold onto the front padded area, although the padding is not cut perfectly to fit the plastic underneath. Her feet fit into the foot boxes, and sometimes she takes them out but puts them back in again.    I am 5'8\\" on the bike and can keep my chest off of her helmet when riding. I keep my knees just slightly outside of where they would normally be to clear the wee-ride. I can go up hills and along the roads with no real loss of power.    Anyway, we get a lot of looks from other parents, many people ask about it. My daughter really likes it.
B0039SFKSW|4.0|Okay, it's hard for me to not long for UK or King Crimson style compositions when I hear Wetton singing or Yes Drama when I hear Howe and Downes. That being said, this is a strong album for what it is: Progressive Pop. End Of The World and Steve's solo on Light The Way are really nice and the sound of this album is pleasant. This is really strong work from Wetton and if you miss the sound of Asia and Alpha, you will like this album. This might even become your favorite Asia album. It is that good in terms of Asia. And, Wetton is actually my favorite vocalist, but, I just don't love these compositions and I'm not the biggest fan of this particular lighter popier style. I thought I would only rate it three stars because I can't imagine that I'll listen to this album more than once at a time (I'll listen to albums I love several times when I rotate through my collection), however, it's a very nice pleasant and well recorded album, so, by Amazon's rating system, I'll give it four stars, because I do LIKE it. My only real gripe is songwriting structure. Not bad and even real good, just not as complex as I like and have become used to from Wetton/Howe/Downes/Palmer. Notice, that I didn't include expectations of ELP. Palmer is  fine and his playing sounds good, but, he's seemed to have lost his signature style. This could be any drummer. Downes sounds like Downes. Howe's playing is better than some of his more recent recordings.  There are a lot of great elements here and if you like Wetton's solo work and Asia you are going to be very happy.

B003E9XQBE|5.0|Loved this book and all the shopaholics series.. very funny and great on a rainy day.
B0031OCY2E|1.0|How anyone could give this utterly boring, convoluted movie more than 1 star is amazing to me. I fell asleep watching it on 4 different occasions; taking extra care on the last viewing not to start it too late, or drink too much before pressing play. The last time I tried watching it I made it to about the 60 minute mark, before collapsing. It is a shame because Matt Damon is a really great actor. His performance in the Talented Mr. Ripley was dazzling. I also loved his performance in \\"Team America\\" :-) Seriously though, this movie could have been so much better. But it was as dull as dull can be. Great cure for insomnia though!
B000002I4W|5.0|This album is a transcendent experience for the close listener, but I'm afraid it might be jarring for the casual listener. It simply cannot exist as background music, or to use a term from Eric Hobsbawm, \\"sonic wallpaper.\\" It demands your attention, and rewards it.<br /><br />One of the great classic jazz albums, this virtually established the genres \\"free jazz\\" or \\"avant-garde jazz.\\" Now those genres are not for the jazz newbie. If you're the kind of person who expects to learn something you don't already know about an album from reviews on amazon.com, then this is probably going to be a little hard for you to hear.<br /><br />But don't let me fool you. I'm fairly new to jazz too (it's a love affair of a few years now), and I really love this album! I don't want to put anyone off too much: we're not talking about John Coltrane's [[ASIN:B001NHZ2QG Ascension]], which is a challenge for almost anyone; this is probably the easiest album in those genres to hear, so get it as soon as you think you're ready for it.<br /><br />If you've heard, for instance, Miles Davis' [[ASIN:B000002ADT Kind of Blue]], John Coltrane's [[ASIN:B0000A118M A Love Supreme]], Charles Mingus' [[ASIN:B00000I14Z Mingus Ah Um]], Stan Getz and Astrud Gilberto in [[ASIN:B0000047CX Getz/Gilberto]], Cannonball Adderly's [[ASIN:B00000I41J Somethin' Else]], and perhaps a dozen other similarly famous albums, then you're surely ready for this one. But if not, you might want to start with them and come back to this in a few months. If you decide you like it, you might try Eric Dolphy's [[ASIN:B00000I8UK Out to Lunch]] next.<br /><br />(And if you have the kind of rebellious streak in you that I have, this kind of advice will lead to you getting Ascension first and the others later, and in its way that will be a good experience. If you enjoy pushing yourself that way, let me also suggest the Kronos Quartet playing George Crumb's [[ASIN:B000005J0D Black Angels]]. To each his/her own, friends.)
B000J233SK|5.0|This CD is very easy to listen to with not only a Celtic flavor but also a middle eastern flavor. I like it very much.
B00005LANG|5.0|I grew up in a non-musical household: no one played anything, and the only music we heard was in church and my mother's occasional white southern gospel music (the Oak Ridge Boys and so on). Rock was Satanic, and no one had heard of classical music. I've spent the nearly two decades of my adult life compensating for this tragedy!<br /><br />Of course reggae wasn't on the map either. (Had it been, it would've been forbidden due to its association with Rastafarianism.)<br /><br />Well, no matter what your religious views, this is an album that you really should hear, and I should've heard sooner. I got it a few weeks ago, have heard it a few times, and it is unquestionably excellent in every way: musically, lyrically, technically, spiritually. (This is not to endorse Rastafarianism, about which I know almost nothing, but the lyrics of the song \\"Guiltiness,\\" for instance, are solidly in the great prophetic tradition stretching back to Amos and Isaiah.)<br /><br />What I mean to say: this album is an essential moment in the history of 20th century popular music. If you've educated yourself about classic rock, jazz, the blues, it's time you got some reggae, and you won't want to miss this.<br /><br />Let me toss in some other \\"Latin\\" albums (a category that doesn't really please me, but it's out there anyway and I'll use it this time) I'd consider important for anyone aspiring to cultural literacy: [[ASIN:B000002WF8 Calypso]] stands at the beginning of this tradition; [[ASIN:B0012GMX7Y I Can See Clearly Now]] is probably the most famous example of it; [[ASIN:B000003OXQ Mambo Diablo]] seems to have been unfairly neglected in recent decades; [[ASIN:B0000047CX Getz/Gilberto]] may be the all-time single greatest album in this category; but [[ASIN:B000002G6J Wave]] should not be overlooked. Many hours of great pleasure await us!<br /><br />\\"Don't worry about a thing, cuz every little thing is gonna be alright.\\"

0307454541|1.0|Yep, that is in fact the original title of this book which was a huge bestseller in Sweden - from there the strange fever spread to the rest of Scandinavia as well as other countries and has now reached the US. I was stunned to see that all three books are in the Top 10 on Amazon.<br /><br />The US publisher knew well that the original title \\"Men Who Hate Women\\" would not do here in America and so changed the title. Ah, those clever, clever marketing people.<br /><br />I wonder why this book and its two sequels have become bestsellers and I have a theory: there are a lot of angry women of all ages out there: women who have been sexually abused, physically abused, emotionally abused, cheated on, lied to - you name it. They're angry at their fathers, brothers, uncles, boyfriends and husbands, ex-boyfriends, ex-husbands, their bosses, former bosses as well as politicians, priests, celebrities, etc. (There may even be some angry men who have bought the books - perhaps they were abused as children or they hate their father?)<br /><br />The male Swedish author Stieg Larsson (who - what a big bummer for him financially - passed away at age 50 of a heart attack before the books were even published) seemingly tapped into this anger. His own anger was of a different kind and was directed primarily against right wing extremists in Sweden. There has even been speculation in Sweden that he was bumped off by one of his many political enemies. (not entirely implausible after all since Prime minister Oluf Palme, a Social Democrat, was assassinated in 1986 - his murder marked the end of political innocence in Sweden).<br /><br />My brother in Scandinavia spoke highly of the books and on my most recent visit in December he gave me all three books. The first chapter of the first book starts out very promising, but the novel takes a complete nose dive from then on: it becomes confusing, tedious, with a million characters, plot turns, and details that left me utterly bored - and I'm not easily bored.<br /><br />I then watched the Swedish/Danish film co-production/adaptation (directed by Danish director Niels Arden Oplev) on DVD. The film makers thankfully and wisely chose to do away with most of the details and characters, but the film is still a failure and includes two brutal rape scenes as well as other violent scenes. The film is now playing in US theaters and the two sequels (which I have not seen) will most likely open here as well. There is also an American adaptation in the works (I shudder to think of what Hollywood will do with it - probably take a bad film and make it worse).<br /><br />The main character could have been interesting: she is a petite, goth/punk, bi-sexual, 20-something woman, a computer hacker who trusts no one and takes gruesome revenge on her male legal guardian. She ends up teaming up with the 40-something journalist hero who is hired by a wealthy man on an island off the Swedish coast to find out what happened to the old man's daughter decades ago. Not such a bad premise, but both the book and the film fail to deliver and instead pile on the cliches. A real shame because the film could have been a decent one. (It is also very disappointing and frustrating to see yet another young woman/middle aged man pairing.)<br /><br />As a woman who has dealt with her share of princes-turned-toads, I can to a large degree understand the anger that many women feel towards the opposite gender and sadly women continue to be treated as 2nd class citizens in this world by many men. However, this book and its film adaptation will not solve any problems.<br /><br />Below are the mind blowing stats that explain why Larsson's Swedish common law widow has been fighting tooth and nail to get her piece of the big money pie.<br /><br />[Larsson] \\"was the second best-selling author in the world in 2008, behind Afghan-American author Khaled Hosseini. By March 2010 his Millennium trilogy had sold 27 million copies in over 40 countries.\\"<br /><br/>That's a whole lotta money pie, my friends.<br /><br />(source: Wikipedia, 2010)<br /><br />NOTE: If you're looking for a literary thriller/mystery set in Scandinavia, I highly recommend the superb and much praised international Danish bestseller \\"Smilla's Sense of Snow\\" from 1993 by Peter Hoeg which takes place in Copenhagen, Denmark and en route to/in Greenland.

B001GJ3VYG|1.0|I have no problem listening to this album and giving you my opinion of it.  But, when the first hurdle is to figure out why the record labels wants me to pay extra for a so-called \\"Bonus\\" version, then prevent me from enjoying it, I don't think that quite deserves my respect.      I am a committed Dido fan who might have some very compelling things to share about this album.  But when Arista cares more about preventing me from listening to it because they are so scared the fans of a mondo-mega-seller like Dido might shortchange them a few pennies by playing the bonus disc in my computer - WHEN IN FACT THE FIRST DISC PLAYS AND RIPS FINE! - well, their corporate stupidity probably just cost them a glowing review.      The bonus disc automatically boots-up with its' own player, and plays the video fine.  However, consumers should know that it's the very same video you can access right off Amazon's page for free, so if you were going to spring for the Bonus Edition for the video, you will be wasting your money.    The problem is, whether you defeat the video player booting-up or not, there doesn't seem to be a way to get your computer to find the three bonus audio tracks; so, if you wanted the Bonus Edition for the bonus music tracks, let it be known that the record label charging you for them, apparently wants to limit your enjoyment of what you paid for.      For that reason alone, I can recommend the Bonus Edition of the album ONLY if you find it in some \\"used\\" bin, preferably somewhere in Pennsylvania...because it is likely to be mine.     You're welcome, Arista.
B002GZQYMA|5.0|I've been into Muse after hearing some in a video an online friend made a few years ago. Since then I cannot get enough Muse! For someone who was raised on classical, dug 70's rock, 80's punk and New Wave, there is a little of each in their music. Having eclectic tastes can be difficult (for me): I can listen to Stravinsky or Beethoven, and tire of them. Or, Queen then the Sex Pistols, then Duran Duran, and want to listen to something else.    Listening to Muse satisfies all of these listening impulses. Their use of what I have heard called 'Musical Quotes' I find simply mesmerizing. The last three tracks on the CD are simply beautiful and transition well between pieces (Exogenesis) and I find parts reminiscent of Debussy.     Sure there are musical references to Queen, but there is so much more. I think they are the most exciting band making progressive music today.    It's be nice to hear them more on the radio in the states, but until then I'll be enjoying my CD.    For anyone with eclectic tastes in music that range from rock to classical, I would recommend this item.
B000WCN8SC|4.0|I would give this an 8 out of 10.  If you are a Doors and 5.1 fan, and can get this for around $50 I would pick this up.  The surround mix is a bit tame, but the videos, additional music (also in 5.1), and fullness/separation to the instruments make this box worth-wile.       So this appears to be the umpteenth re-mastering cash grab by the Doors of their back catalog...Anyway, the DVD-A's sound great!  There is a fullness and clarity to their songs I have not heard before, in particular the use of the echo chamber employed on Morrison's vocals for the Strange Days album.  However, the resolution is not as breath-taking as I have heard of other older bands who had their work butchered being translated over to cd.         The DVD-A surround mix is limited by the primitive technology they had available to them (The 1st album is more of a 3.0 mix.  I say 3.0 as opposed to 3.1 as there is very little sub-woofer output for the entire box set) and really the surround mix does not really start to become noticeable until their third album Waiting for the Sun.  Even then things are mixed on the conservative side although going in people should not expect some sort of Flaming Lips or NIN type mixing wizardry.  There is impressive separation of the instruments and some of the music has changed (new intro. on \\"L.A. woman,\\" additional lyric on \\"Break on Through\\" and the odd Morrison joke before or after a track).          I was impressed with the bonus videos and music.  In fact, I wish they would have included another DVD of a live concert (Hollywood Bowl?).  Also fans should know that the album: Absolutely Live is NOT included in this box.  The bonus music is also DVD-A, 5.1.
B000BQ7BX2|4.0|I just finished listening to these nine symphonies in order, score in hand, for the first time ever. In fact, it was the first time I've heard all the symphonies by one conductor, and the first time I've followed along with the score for most of them.  I'm obviously no Mahler expert, in fact, I've never considered myself a huge fan, so take that into account.  I have read all of the Amazon reviews and agree with the bulk of what has been said -- these are very beautiful and absorbing performances and I look forward to listening to them again.  The critical observations that follow are not meant to discourage anyone from buying them: I think the set would be a good addition to any Mahler collection, no matter how large, and a fine place to start for beginners.          First, regarding tempos, I don't think they are too slow, for the most part. I checked the timings for the first four symphonies against other recordings in my collection, and Bertini was marginally faster in three of them.  There are a few individual movements -- the final movement of the ninth is fresh in my mind -- that seem simply too slow for musical coherence, but there are many more where his marginal relaxation illuminates wonderful details I'd never noticed before.  I was more bothered by the balances between instruments: often I would be following a musical thread and would simply not be able to hear what I was seeing at all. It's one thing to subordinate secondary voices, but make them totally disappear? I noticed this far too often for it to be mistakes on the part of musicians (though one reviewer did notice many of these, I'm just not that good of a musician), and so I wonder whether these were decisions on the part of the conductor or quirks of the recording process.  In the eighth I noticed that soloists were inconsistently spotlighted, so I suspect the recording engineers may have monkeyed with too many knobs and sliders.  Listening without reference to the score, most of thesethings would probably go undetected, and I plan to test that theory on the next round.  Lastly, I must say that I noticed that the Orchestra was not in the same class as the Concertgebouw, Vienna, Berlin, or the old Philharmonia, and I missed some of their artistry, particularly in the woodwinds.  The transparency and realism of these recordings is so good that it is a joy to listen to even when it reveals (slight) deficiencies.  All of these quibbles are very minor weighed against the beauties of these performances.  I might suggest supplementing this set with speedier 3rd and 9th symphonies, and a 7th with more Mahlerian mystery, like Bernstein/New York.

B0009JJMFQ|3.0|This is a great looking truck but more of a collectable to sit on a shelf.....not something for a kid to play with.
B00006L9ZT|5.0|This is a classy 1980's performance of Wagner's titanic Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring) by James Levine and a superb Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. I am not speaking to those who have an acute understanding of the Wagnerian literature, are opera buffs of very long standing, are technically versed in the complexities of music or have seen many different productions of The Ring. This is a report only for those who like opera with subtitles, want to see it in some approximation of how Wagner intended it to be, and are not going to  sit for three plus hours (even broken by their own intermissions) to see any two-disc opera in the series of four.<br />For those who are, more or less, the average viewer, there is a real treat here. The singing ranges from fine to outstanding. The acting, for opera, is much above average. Standouts in one or more of the operas in The Ring, who sing and emote in great style are, James Morris and Matti Salminen, two stalwarts of stature, Siegfried Jerusalem, a tenor hero, who handles himself well on stage, Heinz Zednik and Ekkehard Wlaschima, who are in the tradition of supporting players who light up the stage; then there is the heroine, played and sung with vigor, pathos and rage, by Hildegard Behrens, Christa Ludwig, an old pro of considerable talent, makes a number of important appearances, and, well, let me leave it at that, though I omit such prominent names as Kurt Moll and Dawn Upshaw, who deserve mention in any more thorough review.<br />Then there is the production and video staff who deserve the highest praise for providing we average viewers with scenic, visual and audio design which, probably, conveys something of what Wagner would recognize as what he intended, while keeping it fresh and vivid to modern viewers.<br />Then, there is the Orchestra, playing with a verve and splendor that provides foundation not competition with the singers. No doubt James Levine, their conductor and leader of the Mets team effort, has every reason to be proud of his players, and proud of what everyone did to make this the DVD experience it is.<br />As I say, I cannot compare it with other full productions, nor would I seek another Melchior or Flagstadt, whom I heard and saw on occasion in the forties, they were forces of nature, but, as with all performers, of their time and place. What I would say is, everyone should see and hear The Ring (at least once) for it is one of the musical gems of opera. Levine sees to it that we hear it so as to appreciate Wagner's achievement. The remainder of the creative and technical group, as well as the performers, see to it that we see an approximation of the work that Wagner put together to go with the music. I don't think you can go wrong with this set.
B0002DB0FO|3.0|Good story plot in first season concerning Colin, a boy that the doctor literally brings back to life from a coma. ALL is not well for Colin as he struggles to make a new identity for himself and later gets sick again. My problem with the show is everything goes wrong for everybody. Hardly any happy things occur. The preacher and wife get divorced then he goes blind... It got depressing after awhile for me. The relationship between Gregory Smith and Emily Van Kemp keeps you interested, but from other season reviews, I have seen it gets very complicated after he has a fling with the babysitter and she gets pregnant but he does not find out till she has had the baby adopted with a confidential clause that he can't see it.

0385338910|4.0|Within the span of a few pages I really did. This declaration is so overused by so many reviewers, I disregard it. But I used it here because for once its true, and I'm a hard case. There is enough dark funny ironic,  Palahniukesque, wit to balance the sadness and sentimentality. Almost.<br /> Nearly every author finds a way to slip his views into his novels, best example being Tom Robbins, and so here too does Tropper. And so, with 42 reviews already I'm going to use this one to rebut one of Tropper's that nearly had me tossing the book out in the rain although it appeared well past the halfway point. It was that disturbing. Tropper's lead character is lamenting the \\"problem\\" of his small town's preserved downtown, which by design naturally brings people out onto public sidewalks, etc. The \\"problem\\" being, inevitably running into friends and acquaintences thus necessitating personal interaction. Whereas malls with their vast deserts of parking, driveup windows, and suburbia's many other innovations protect us from such dreadfulness, granting us a level of personal isolation never before known to mankind! On page 162, speaking of the zoning board's refusal to permit a new mall he writes, \\" Like all fairly affluent suburbs, preservation is the priority, not growth\\". So, whats wrong with preservation, and what's so great about \\"growth\\"? It seems to me that \\"Growth\\" just for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell. Apropos for endless mind numbing blight of ugly strip commercial developments that have nearly eaten away and homogenized our entire country aka \\"growth\\". Safe in our isolation, from inside our cars, we can depend on the same reliably bad meals from the same 15 chain restaurants in every suburb. Up until this point at page 162 I was excited to have discovered a new author who rose above the usual fare from the bestseller and Opra lists. Unfortunately such a view reveals a broad blind spot which would seem to preclude the artistic and human sensebilties to observe his world and produce work worthy of intelligent readers. I would like to give Tropper the benefit of the doubt and believe he is using irony here but I think not. When Tropper employs irony its always pretty clear.<br /> So with that off my chest, like Doug, I got over it and enjoyed the story. In the latter 1/3 I found Doug's over thinking and sentimental reminiscences grew a little tiresome lacking the self deprecating irony that balanced same through most of the story. And finally though great books always fail to make good movies I think this is a good book that could be a great movie.  Just let Michael Arndt have the screenplay and we might have another Little Miss Sunshine or something better. But I can still recommend read it, the wait for the movie could be long.bilties to observe his world and produce work worthy of intelligent readers.

1423113381|4.0|As a big fan of the Percy Jackson books I was quite excited to get my hands on this.  I loved Rick Riordan's sense of humor and knowledge of mythology, not to mention the fact the man can tell an entertaining story.  Short response to this?  I think most Percy Jackson fans and even fresh readers will be quite pleased.<br /><br />Let me critique first.  While \\"The Red Pyramid\\" has all the right ingredients, it did not have me for much of an emotional impact.  It's a lot of fun, but I never quite made any connections with any characters.  They're nice enough, hardly two-dimensional in any sense of the word, but they also may have been victims of a rushed plot.  Because, yes, the plot was rushed.  It's a lengthy volume, but I think Riordan was still aiming for lots and lots of plot. Good plot, yes, but I do like slowers moments in my books where the characters and I can recover, maybe ponder the meaning of what's happening. Not here.<br /><br />Now for the good stuff.  This is one thoroughly fun book.  The plot is intricate and intelligent and never fails in the creativity department.  Many of the ideas that made Percy Jackson work (gods living among us, child heroes, random monster attacks) are here in place--along with a small reference to the Greek Gods over at the Empire State Building. I liked that.  Sadie and Carter are two great characters who work well for this story.  Their family is fascinating: dead mother, Egyptologist/magician father constantly on the run.<br /><br />Then there is the Egypt stuff.  My Egypt phase actually ended in high school, but I think this was all acceptable from what I remember. Either way, here's to hoping the current juvenile generation will be ransacking libraries for books on ancient Egypt.  The gods are not quite in the same goofy modern personas (for the most part) as Percy Jackson's were, but manage to cling to that mysterious Egypt amazingness.  From what I can tell, Riordan once more did his homework, and I truly appreciated how he stuck to the myth basics.<br /><br />I also believe the writing has improved. It's still fun, simple writing, but the pace and flow are better, syntax just ever so much more lovely.  The method of telling the story--tape recordings--is fun and interesting and makes for the occasional fun brother/sister argument.  Some may find it confusing, but the current narrator is helpfully noted at the top of each page--and I also survived the 5+ narrators of Chris Heimerdinger's \\"Tennis Shoes\\" series.  Two people is nothing.<br /><br />Will this top Percy Jackson?  It didn't for me and I don't know if it will for the majority?  Will this hold its own?  I really think it will.  \\"The Red Pyramid\\" is exciting, well-written, extremely creative, and highly enjoyable.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next Kane installment.th basics.

B000002J1S|5.0|\\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\" was the last Genesis album with the \\"classic\\" Genesis lineup (Tony Banks, Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel, Steve Hackett, Mike Rutherford); and if that group had to break up, this album was a great way for them to say goodbye.  This concept album tells the story of a New York teenager named Rael whose life moves from the tough streets of 20th-century New York to a phantasmagorical landscape that mixes mythological references, popular culture allusions, and castration anxiety, among other things.  Highlights of this album, for me, include the title track, with its clever references to the 1960's hit \\"Broadway.\\" \\"In the Cage\\" is always a high point of Genesis concerts; a cage of stage lights descends around the singer to reinforce the song's story of a caged Rael looking on in spiritual agony, seeing his lost brother John turn away from the cage without even trying to help him.  Abandoned twice by his brother, Rael still seeks to help John, undertaking a risky ride down a rock scree and over the rapids to save his brother -- only to find, after the rescue is completed, that he is looking into not John's face, but his own.  \\"Something's changed; that's not your face.  It's mine!  It's mine!\\"  The story may sound bizarre, but give the album a listen.  Ultimately, it becomes a rock-music restatement of the very old but still important idea that only when we reach out to help others do we truly find ourselves.  This album demands and rewards repeat listenings.  \\"It is here; it is now.\\"

B002XTBE6K|5.0|It's lovely to see a Jane Austen story given the time it deserves instead of being squeezed into less than 2 hours. All Jane Austen's should be British miniseries.    Romola is a bit too exuberant at times as Emma, but is still believable as the character. Jonny Lee Miller is excellent - the best Knightley I've seen yet. The rest of the cast is all excellent, the costumes and design are perfect. The chemistry between Emma and Knightley is subtle as it should be and very believable.    This is an absolute delight!
B00008EY9G|5.0|\\"Identity\\" is the kind of film where you need to pay attention the entire time. There are moments in the film that you will need to remember in order to understand what is happening.    \\"Identity\\" is about 10 people that get stuck at a motel during a bad storm. One by one each of the 10 people are turing up dead. Meanwhile, in a place that is unknown a psychiatrist is trying to prove a man innocent convicted of murder. Without spoiling the film, this is all I can say about the plot.    \\"Identity\\" is a great film that keeps you guessing to the very end. This is the way a great thriller film is made.  Also, John Crusack and Ray Liotta did a great job!
0441017177|3.0|Purslane and Campion are two Gentian shatterlings from the House of Flowers, two of a thousand clones of Abigail Gentian who left the solar system around the year 3000 to travel and explore the galaxy. All shatterlings meet up for their thousand nights reunion during which they share memories of what they have experienced.    Six million years have passed since the first ships left the solar system and due to the technology available the shatterlings are effectively immortal. They can pass the hundreds of years travelling between star systems in stasis and experience anything the galaxy has to offer.    On their belated way to the next reunion, Campion and Purslane receive a message warning them not to enter the chosen system and to flee to a designated safe system. The Gentian line were ambushed, almost their entire number wiped out and only a few dozen managing to escape and make their way to Neume where they await any stragglers.    Why does someone want the Gentian Shatterlings dead? Is there a traitor in their midst that helped this atrocity? And what exactly is the House of Suns?    This is the story we follow in House of Suns. Travelling with Campion and Purslane while they visit some systems on their way to the reunion, the aftermath of the attack and the events that follow. The first thing that you need to get used to is the timeframe of the novel. As all travel is done at sub-light speeds, with ftl not possible, the events of travelling between systems is done in tens and hundreds of years of subjective time. Once you get the hang of this it's easy enough to focus on the story without thinking of anything outside of it, unless it's mentioned within the narrative.    The story flows along quite well and is well written, probably one of Reynolds' best to date. Parts of the story feel like self contained short stories, particularly the early sections, although everything in the book has a reason for being there. I was impressed with the scope of the story andthe timeframes involved, although I didn't enjoy the novel as much as I was hoping for. I love Reynolds' short stories and have enjoyed a couple of his novels more than this one and really hoped it would deliver more than it did.    I can't really fault the novel, it's just my tastes that meant I enjoyed it less than I hoped. There was no real feeling of having to read on, no urgency at all. Perhaps that is the result of having the narrative and background over hundreds, thousands and millions of years. A slow burner more than a page turner.
B001HN694K|1.0|This was a big dissapointment. I am (believe it or not) a fan of the Alice in Wonderland story, which is the reason why I do not like this 3-D version of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\"     This film is set many years after the first/original version. Alice is about to get married, when once again, she spots the white rabbit, and follows him. Once back in Wonderland Alice embarks on her true destiny: end the red queen's reign of power.    Overall, I thought this film really did not have a great plot, it was just same old, same old. Its like Tim Burton was more focused on the special effects then the story-line.
0061537969|5.0|A story told by a dog? Car racing as a theme? This book wouldn't have been my choice except that it was selected by our county library system as the yearly All Fairfax Reads. My delight in this book was a reminder that sometimes it is important to stretch a comfort zone, to read a genre or theme that normally wouldn't draw you, and to relish a new perspective. I read the book in one day and immediately sent emails out to my reader friends to pick it up. Although the story was simple, the metaphors were precise and the way the dog guided the reader through themes of love and devotion was spot on. Is it a phenominally crafted book? No, but it is a good read that will make you reflect.

None is as awesome as any of the 10 tracks included on the original album of 10 songs.

Only 5 cuts are included and there is almost a rushed feel to his playing and performance as if, the Stones were back stage with a time piece, arms folded, tapping their collective feet, as they awaited his departure from the stage.  He is respectful of the audience (mostly white folks there to see the Stones, one assumes), but he rocks the blues like no other.<br />.<br />On the other hand, I could have totally done without the 7 track, short-set from Tina & Ike Turner.  It is all sizzle and no steak as far as I'm concerned. They plow thru covers of Otis, Spencer Davis and Fab Four.  Tina twice mentions that \\"her\\" next song will be, such and such. I wonder how calling these \\"her' songs went over with the infamous Ike temper after hours?  Ike & Tina do sort of duet on \\"I've Been Loving You\\", which I kind of started to like, until Tina began to moan like an alley cat.  Then it just got gross for me.<br />.<br />The DVD, like the 5-track bonus CD of Stones material, was a major disappointment.  Panned shots of Jimi and Dylan hanging back stage with Mick and Keith.  A few minutes of what appears to be the initial stages of how the famous cover was hatched.  Charlie Watts on a Mule, in various costume-shop outfits and props, while rain and sleet pelt the camera grew, with Mick directing the procedures.  It way less than thrilling footage, worth a glace, one time.<br />.<br />But one can't help but enjoy the first Disc and wonder if there is not a better way to present this material.

B001VPJYZK|5.0|Season five was a great season for Desperate Housewives. The story jumps five years in to the future which opens up a lot of new stories.  Throughout the season the show explains what all happened in the missing five years and keeps things moving in the 'current' storyline.  There are some big changes for some of the housewives and one of them finally meets her demise. It's a great season with a really good suspenseful finale.
0439023483|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. If you are looking for a fast, can't put the book down read this one is for you!!!  After I read the book my daughter read it and now her boyfriend is reading it, and he never reads.   This story has something for everyone.  Read it you won't regret it.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|This is a great collection by the queen of disco that shows she does a lot more than just disco!  It's wider range of stuff than her \\"On the Radio\\" album and does a good job of showing her diversity.  A really amazing singer.  Good to have all this stuff on CD, since my old vinyl records were wearing out! :)    Lots of fun and upbeat stuff on this album to put your in a great mood, plus some great ballads.  Definitely one that you'll play again and again.

B00005LIN0|4.0|Many other reviews have covered the basics. The Gershwins' music is an American original and a joy to listen to. Visually, the production is frustrating. The scenes are beautiful but Director Trevor Nunn obviously spent little or no time coaching the singers in the art of effective lip-syncing. Not only is it difficult to understand the lyrics, but many times the actors appear to be unenthusiastically participating. It is perfectly obvious that they are not really singing. The only performer who seems to understand how to lip-sync is Damon Evans as Sportin' Life.    That is why if you are not thoroughly familiar with the entire libretto, I strongly recommend that you turn on the subtitles. Otherwise you will have great difficulty understanding about half of the lyrics.      Why should you buy this DVD anyway? Because it is the only DVD production of the original Porgy and Bess opera available. If you love Porgy and Bess, buy it.
B003BKF696|3.0|This album isn't bad, but it's not good either. You listen to it and can leave it and live on life as you have never heard it before.  For some reason this album specifically reminded me of John Crosby's \\"VAST\\" without the rock or the talent.  There are so many of these indie darling bands on Metacritic that get high reviews.   A lot of this is based on the fact that they are graded on a curve.  Basically because they are not mainstream they are treated like the geeky girl next door.  They're not as hot as the other girl but because they're smaller and one can relate to them a little more so they are over-praised.
0143116738|3.0|\\"The Element\\" offers a series of thought-provoking biographical sketches to help the reader give fresh thought to his or her vocation.  When are you \\"in the element\\"?  What must happen for it to be said of you that you are in your element?  The author uses humor and a soft style to raise questions about whether you are doing what you were meant to be doing.<br /><br />My wife and I read this to each other during my sabbatical and decided to read it aloud to our teenagers when we got home, in hopes that it sparks a conversation as they look around for their own pathway.  We did find the last couple of chapters different in substance and tone, as the book turned toward a discussion of educational reform.  What had seemed more like a self-help book became a position paper on what's wrong with K-12 (and beyond).  The change was a little jarring, although it kept us as professional educators talking.<br /><br />With self-effacing charm and irresistible anecdotes, the author helped us turn an aimless task of reflection into useful dialogue, at just the right time in our lives.  A handy little book for folks who wonder where their life might be headed.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Like many people, I'd already seen Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog on the internet when I bought this.  I was mostly interested in a better resolution version of the same, but wow did I get more than I expected.  There are more extras, commentaries and easter eggs per minute of original footage than any DVD I have ever seen.  Entertaining, put together well, and wonderful in all it's excess, I highly recommend this DVD.  For the price it is quite a steal.
0385341008|4.0|I loved this book! It has interesting historical elements but is essentially a love story. I don't care for \\"romance\\" novels per se and this book strikes the perfect balance: it has the love story theme at its heart but isn't the least bit sappy. It's the story of two adults who have waited to meet \\"the one\\", weren't willing to settle for less, and then reap the rewards of their patience. It moves quickly and is hard to put down, especially towards the end. I loved the happy ending and I highly recommend it.
B0021L8V1G|4.0|After a spectacular start with Iron Man a couple summers ago, one would have hoped for an even better sequel, considering the fortunes of the Spiderman, X Men, and Batman franchises of late, whose sophomore efforts took their series to dizzying new heights.  Not so here, although Iron Man 2 is definitely not a step down either.  Consider it on par with the original film and as such, a pretty entertaining, well made Marvel Comics screen entry, and it boasts another strong performance by Robert Downey, Jr. as the hero.    Picking up where industrialist genius, Tony Stark, reveals himself to be Iron Man, the folks in Washington D.C., namely the military and Congress want the technology.  He defies the Senate panel by declaring the armor as private property that has brought world peace.  Stark's competitor, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) is desperate to claim the military's approval for armored weaponry.  Stark's main girl, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is trying to help him run Stark Enterprises despite Tony's childish antics and thrill seeking.  His buddy, Lt. Col. Jim Rhodes (Don Cheadle taking over for Terrence Howard), is under pressure by the military to get the Iron Man technology.  A new assistant, Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson), has a mysterious background.  All this as Starks' blood is beginning to get poisoned by his ebbing, artificial heart.      Enter the Russian, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), whose father was snubbed by Stark's dad.  He has developed a body armor that has electric whips, while Hammer provides him the resources to exact revenge.  Stark must come to terms with the distant relationship with his late father as he desperately searches for an answer to his failing heart.  As Hammer presents his new military hardware to an audience, Ivan and Tony engage in a battle royal.      What the filmmakers needed to do (and could have done a bit more) was to let Downey carry the film on his shoulders; he's certainly earned the right to flex his acting muscles after Iron Man.  Here, he shows off his flair for being a bad boy whose arrogance is matched by his tech savvy, and he is a hero confronting his inner demons and pain which are directly related to the fallout with his father.  It is interesting how poppa Stark is portrayed in newsreel footage as a kind of Industrial version of Walt Disney complete with a topographic industrial plan instead of a theme park.      Downey and Paltrow have good repartee and a smooth chemistry even when they argue.  The dialogue is snappy and at times funny courtesy of screenwriter Justin Theroux (Tropic Thunder) and director Jon Favreau who still knows how to convey the fantasy world of super heroes, and there are enough twists and surprises to keep things humming along.    Rourke is sufficiently menacing as Ivan, spouting Russian and a dark, defiant persona.  Samuel Jackson repeats as Nick Fury, the head of S.H.I.E.L.D., a secret organization that is attempting to assemble `The Avengers Initiative'.  Johansson is on screen too briefly but there is a nice payoff where she comes through in fine form, or should I say fighting form.  As a US Senator, comedian Garry Shandling is stunt casting but proves a bit of a distraction; you just can't take his character seriously.  Marvel co-creator Stan Lee makes another brief cameo, and Favreau is amusing in a larger supporting role of Happy Hogan.      Special effects are impressive and ably serve the story.  That suit of armor still wows and functions in true comic book form.  There is a familiar, circular prop that appears in a crucial scene that Marvel fans will want to note!  Stunt work and the fight choreography that involves Johansson's character is fun to watch but you wish there were more.      Favreau has shown a knack for comic heroes, but he has not made the big step to improve on his franchise.  Perhaps in Iron Man 3 he can break the curse that has plagued super hero franchises that fell down in their third films.  By the way, dostay after the credits for an interesting clip that hints at the ever growing Marvel Universe.
B002BIULQ2|4.0|I can't believe that I'm reviewing this movie!  But Disney products are hard to avoid.  Who else has seen several episodes of the series?  It may not be Shakespeare. But the show is usually fun to watch.     There should be three rules for movie adaptations of TV series.  One, don't just offer us a 90 minute episode. Two, don't contradict what we've already seen on the small screen. Three, don't make a movie that requires knowledge of the TV series.  This movie mostly follows two of these rules.     The plotline of the series is the same as this movie.  Miley Stewart is torn between being a rock star and normal teenager.  Sometimes this conflict can be overwhelming.  Yet she usually makes both worlds work.      The movie opens up with Miley and her best friend Lily frantically rushing to a Hannah Montana concert.  I found this part a little unbelievable.  By now she should know about being a professional.  Also, we've seen Lily backstage in her own disguise as Lola.       A lot of the problems with Miley/Hannah come from her new publicist.  Vanessa Williams does a great job as this character.  But I kept wondering why Robby Ray, Miley's dad/manager didn't just fire her.  A later sequence suggests that the publicist doesn't directly work for them.      Miley mentions wishing that she could be Hannah all the time.  Someone forgot about Disney's wish gone wrong bit. The theme ran through several of their series.  Miley, along with Raven, Zack, and Cody, wished on a  shooting star.  Being Hannah all the time was a nightmare.  Incidentally, where is her bodyguard Roxy?   Miley blows off the really important people in her life.  She misses seeing her brother Jackson leave for college. (The series later had him going closer to home.)  She accidentally attends Lily's birthday party as Hannah.  That was one of my biggest beefs with this movie.  Some of the series actors only get cameos. Mitchel Musso and Moses Arias are two. Note:  Arias' character doesn't know her secret.Hannah and Tyra Banks get in a fight over shoes.  Then she wants to blow off her grandmother's birthday party for an awards show.  Robby Ray's had enough. This could be the end.  I imagine that he owns the Hannah character. The plane doesn't land in New York, but back in Tennessee. Jackson's waiting in the truck.      Miley gets two weeks to detox from Hannah.  During this time she reconnects with her family and old friends.  There's her horse BlueJeans.    It's too bad no one thought to include some flashbacks.  We could have learned more about the Hannah back story. Brooke Shields has played her mom on the series.  Her photo is shown in one scene.      I have something in common with Miley. One of my grandmothers was also named Ruby.  She was from Tennessee!  This is her maternal one.  Vicki Lawrence has played her paternal one on the series.     When Miley is starting to readjust, Hannah comes back.  Her home town of Crowley Corners is in financial trouble. A developer wants to change the place big time. Someone suggests a concert.  She gets Lily to come help.  At one point Lily even pretends to be Hannah.  Later we have Miley doing some quick change bits.  She's having dinner with the friend, and mayor.  Some parts of this movie do fall flat.  I didn't care much for the romances.  We have Miley reconnecting with an old friend.  Robby Ray also finds love.     I've often thought that Hannah's secret seemed too open.  Her father and even hometown are well known.  Various family members have mentioned it a little too openly.  One episode had a lookalike cousin, also played by Miley, threaten to expose her.     This movie has her grandmother mention it on a public street.  Thankfully no one else was close enough to hear.  The bit about the tabloid reporter seemed very silly.  His having teenage daughters should have been enough for him not to touch it.     There are three really good things about this movie.  One, we have some nice songs.  A few are done by otherfamous stars.  It makes you wonder.  Miley Stewart could do what Miley Cyrus has done.  Just have two separate musical identities.  She wouldn't be the first.  Ever heard of Luke the Drifter, Chris Gaines, or even Lester \\"Roadhog\\" Moran?     Two, there is some beautiful scenery of Tennessee.  Who else feels like paying a visit?   Three, the chemistry between real-life father and daughter Cyrus is great on the big screen too.          There will obviously be no sequel to this movie.  The series is currently in its last season.  But I hope that we haven't seen the last of Hannah Montana.  At the very least, Miley Cyrus should stay true to her youngest fans.  She can mature as a performer and still stay family friendly.
B001UREJWM|5.0|Over the years I had my fun with Dio in various Amazon reviews. Lots of memories there for me. I think a lot of people couldn't help but laugh a little at times at Dios over the top metal bravado,,, but we all no doubt respected and (most importantly) cranked the tunes up anyways, whether it was his solo, his Rainbow stuff, his Sabbath stuff or whatever. He passed on to the next plain of reality yesterday afternoon, and we all must realize that the world (and Underworld) has let a fine talent go. Rest in Peace Ronnie James.<br /><br />That being said, now is the time for all y'all to check out this last effort by the man, along with one of his finest backing groups, the Mach II Sabbath. I saw them tour this bit a few years back and it was absolutely amazing. Mach II Sabbath is just as legendary as the Mach I Ozzy years, and they proved themselves several times. Once in the early eighties, again in 1992, and then again in 2007 and beyond with these Heaven & Hell recordings. All killer stuff, and seriously boasts some of Dios most hardcore vocals of all time. CHECK IT!
B000008I51|4.0|The 1980s were a rough time for fans that enjoyed listening to classic progressive rock and even moreso for the musicians.  In this respect I have to give Marillion credit for releasing this album when they did (1983); especially given that progressive was unfashionable at the time.<br /><br />As an early example of the neo-progressive style, musical influences are taken primarily from American stadium rock (Styx) and British symphonic pop (Supertramp, Alan Parsons) with occasional flourishes of the classic progressive style here and there.  Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" (1979) was also apparently influential and bits and pieces of that album turn up on a few tracks.<br /><br />Although I have used the term \\"progressive\\", there are marked differences when compared with the classic 1970s progressive style.  The tracks on Script for a Jesters Tear are simplistic in terms of meter and harmony, there is not too much in the way of thematic development, vocal harmonies are absent, and the \\"concepts\\" are not as far-reaching as the inner spiritual journeys that the 1970s groups took listeners on.  There also seems to be a tendency to repeat certain riffs (usually played in unison on the bass guitar and drums) on different tracks. Overall, while the playing sounds amateurish at times, they would eventually tighten their sound up with the addition of prog veteran Ian Mosley (drums and percussion).<br /><br />Still, this is pretty good stuff, especially in comparison to what else was around in 1983.  For me, the highpoints of the album include the lyrics of lead singer \\"Fish\\", who was certainly the most distinctive vocalist of the entire neo-progressive genre, and the cover art of Mark Wilkinson.  I also like the quieter passages.<br /><br />The production of this (non-remastered) album is a bit weak and thin.  Although the liner notes feature the lyrics, the artwork is lacking (the same image is featured on every page).<br /><br />All in all, this is a good example of early 1980s neo-progressive rock that ultimately paved the way for groups like Spock's Beard and the Flower Kings in the 1990s.  Although this is a decent album, my personal favorite with Fish as lead singer is Clutching at Straws (1987).paved the way for groups like Spock's Beard and the Flower Kings in the 1990s.

B001DE29SS|5.0|The attention and work Downey put into becoming Chaplin showed just how awesome he is practicing his art. His performance is even more remarkable in this movie when you consider the time period that he made it in. If I'm not mistaken he was either still full swing in and out of rehab or at the tail end of it. Either way, his raw talent shown through whatever ordeals he was consumed with offscreen.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|The fifth season of Supernatural was by far one of th most enjoyable seasons of the show and the ending of Eric Kripke's main five season storyline was very touching and emotional. Even though the show has been picked up for a sixth season i think they should have let it end here with the 'Apocolypse' storyline while its still ahead of the game. I certainly hope that the show doesn't lose its appeal in the coming season and that the writers can come up with an equally engaging storyline like Kripke did.

0061438294|5.0|After working for the FBI for twenty five years, Joe Navarro has refined his expertise in body language to a perfect art. He describes how he wished he had known what he does now when he was in the FBI. Now, while he still consults to the FBI, rather than spending most of his time catching crims, he uses his skills to help others succeed - whether it be helping people win more poker games, identify psychopaths, identifying terrorists, enhance their career be a better health professional or even become an advanced body language reader.<br /><br />In his book: What every BODY is saying, Joe discussed why non-verbal communication is accurate in identifying someone's true intentions, beliefs or feelings once we have taken into consideration the cultural norm and the individuals normal tendencies.<br /><br />I like the fact that the book is broken up into sections related to different parts of the body. He highlights that although we are often aware of body language related to the face and torso, some of our best clues to what someone is thinking or feeling can be found in the language spoken by the hands and feet.<br /><br />The pictures are exaggerated, but being real photographs allow the reader to practice the non-verbal, to be aware when they may find themselves in that space. As awareness is always the first stage in change, I think it is essential to be aware of our own non-verbal behaviour before trying to analyse others. It is also interesting to see how changing some of our body language can affect others - positively or negatively.<br /><br />When using the book, the pictures complement the words, but do not replace them. The book is well written with narratives to strengthen our understanding.<br /><br />It is not like a novel that can be read from front to back without any integration, however I am sure that some people can read the book and work on increasing their awareness and then understanding on non-verbal behaviour. I read each section individually, and tried to become aware of my own behaviour and others around me before moving onto the next section.<br /><br />Relevance to Health Professionals<br /><br />Communication skills are strongly emphasized as a core competency of health professionals.

055357342X|5.0|Well, I started with my journey through Westeros a while ago, reaching up 'till the end of third book and I can't say and remain honest that it hasn't been an enjoyable trip. Sure, entire series has it's ups and downs and one could argue indefinitely about \\"the artistic value\\" of Martin's work. But, one thing must be said - Martin knows how to deliver his story. And truth as it may be, that this story often takes on a soap-opera road, there are details and certain nuances that redeem the entire series and one should endure through thousand of pages just for that. People on Amazon and elsewhere have raged about Martin killing dominant characters and twisting the plot up to that level where only a clear cut could untwist it again, but in a sort of weird and twisted way everything makes sense. And that's because Martin doesn't write fantasy epic here. Sure, there are dragons and magic and whatnot, but in the end it's the simulation of everyday life and everyday politics which keeps the entire project going. And in everyday life and everyday politics people die. Sometimes violently, sometimes in their sleep.<br /><br />It is almost that I can hear you saying: \\"But we don't want to read about everyday life, we want to read fantasy\\" - and that's just a thing, other than escapistic, childish notion of fantasy world and literature itself as something totally different from the world that we live in, fantasy can deliver strong, metaphoric tale from which we can see glimpses of reality and still remain inside the genre (for those who still want that). We just need to get rid of notions of heroes and villains to accomplish that. And Martin did that brilliantly. Whom we perceived as a villain throughout first two books, suddenly starts to develop character - you all know it by now, it has been long enough time this book was published so I might as well say it - Jaime Lannister stopped being your comic-book villain and grew some backbone and  found few interesting thoughts inside his head. Which just show you what can happen to your average grunt if you give him some time to think and influence him with different conditions than he's used to. Also, another interesting thing that Martin sort of hid in here is the notion that at the end of the day, oppressed and harassed people will take the kalashnikov and sort things accordingly. Which in a way shows how every notion of power, and men having it is flawed in it's fundamentals. Other thing like these exist throughout the entire novel and medieval stuff, sword-wielding and lords and ladies going about is just simple and ambiental mask used for different purposes. In the end, there isn't so much fantasy here, just gritty realism successfully hidden between layers of pages and tales about heroes and wars.<br /><br />Maybe that's the reason why I find this volume the best of the three I have read by now. In it, Martin's escape from generic fantasy became most evident (though avid and interested reader could find these thing in first two books as well) and entire series rose quite high on some imagined quality scale of mine. Upon finishing this I'm still interested to travel through the world of Westeros (just hoping that I will yet see the end of this travel before myself, or Martin dies), and that is something that didn't happen for quite a while in terms of endless fantasy epics. I can but recommend this volume, even if it means for you to plow your way through bothersome pages of second volume just to get grip of the things happening. It is really worth a bother.ead.

B000A6T262|4.0|First things first. I see a lot of reviews here actually seem to be about the movies themselves. This is not the place. For that, go to IMDb. Instead, I'm going to review this product, which is the box set of the first ten Star Trek movies on DVD. Well, I'm also going to review the DVDs themselves collectively, but not as movies.<br /><br />First impressions: Nice and simple. Basically, they just took all of the special edition DVD releases and packaged them into a paperboard box. The box lists all of the movies on the top and side, a picture of Kirk on the front end, and a picture of Picard on the back end. Star Trek: The Motion Picture (ST:TMP) looks a little out of place in the set; all the rest of the DVD covers have more or less the same design with a brushed-metal background, but ST:TMP is totally different and has a yellow background.<br /><br />On closer inspection, there are a few issues. Most noticeable is that the individual DVD packaging is rather shoddy. On some cases, the jacket (which holds the cover sleeve in place) is not fully attached and can end up folded back when the case inserted back into the box, probably leading to eventual complete detachment, so that the sleeve might get separated. The casing itself on a couple of cases is poorly fabricated, with numerous extra incompletely cut bits of plastic (especially around the closing snaps), and one case doesn't even join properly at the top when closed. Also, the retaining hubs look flimsy, though they do seem to be easy to use.<br /><br />Moving on to the discs themselves, my fairly new (good quality) DVD+RW drive has trouble even recognizing most of the discs for some reason; however, after installing an ancient 12-year-old DVD-ROM drive I happen to still have and testing with it, they work just fine. It might be the copy protection, or it might be something with the newer drive, but they're not compatible.<br /><br />On the plus side, the content is pretty good, technically speaking.

I'm not familiar with the changes in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, but no doubt it was remastered, as the picture looks a lot better than the previous release. The rest of the DVDs are Special Collector's Editions; I don't know what that means, aside from the presence of an audio commentary, a text commentary, and lots of featurettes.

The TNG movies all include DTS mixes, which may or may not sound audibly better; in any case, I always choose DTS when and where available.<br /><br />Overall, a pretty good box set if you want all ten of these movies together.

0156013983|4.0|More than a simple children's tale, it was my first exposure to a deeper level of the French language.  Simplistic on its face, the chapters could be peeled back to reveal existential philosophy.  It made for interesting discussions with my fellow book club members who were learning French along with me.

B002O1TMI4|4.0|I say mostly, because the song Guiding Light was not one of their best.  Like many people I stumbled upon Muse via soundtracks (Little Nicky-Cave, and Twilight-Supermassive Blackhole and I Belong to You).  I have fallen in love with their music.  They are awesome for someone with eclectic tastes in music, because each song has its own flavor.  From this album, my favorites are Resistance, Uprising, and MK Ultra for their lyrics and beats.  Undisclosed Desires is a very \\"Depeche-Mode-esque\\" type of song.  United States of Eurasia is not one of my favorites, but I do admire it.  Word to the Wise: if you liked the book 1984, then this album would make a great accompaniment.  It is certainly not full of sappy love songs.  Each song has a message and a meaning, which is the best part of everything Muse.
B000QQFKYE|3.0|A schizophrenic, uneven, macabre, absurd and highly ambitious variation of his own `Mulholland Drive', `INLAND EMPIRE' is David Lynch's most recent contribution to the world of cinema.  The cinephile in me is telling me that I'm about to be entirely too harsh on this film.  I mean, this is David Lynch!  Cinematic genius!  Misunderstood visionary!  Alas, as much as I love his work, `INLAND EMPIRE' leaves me disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, I love absurd.  When you watch Lynch's masterpieces like `Mulholland Drive' and `Eraserhead' there are high levels of absurdity involved, but they all come together rather cohesively to create something impacting.<br /><br />`INLAND EMPIRE' is less profound and more preposterous.<br /><br />One of the first things I notice here is that the plot and or `revelations' contained here are far too similar to those entertained in `Mulholland Drive'.  This seems to be like a mutated copycat of Lynch's previous film.<br /><br />The film tells the story of an actress named Nikki Grace who lands a fated part in a film that had previously been shut down when the stars were murdered.  After learning this detail, Nikki begins to lose it.  She goes a tad crazy and mixes the lines of her real life and her stage life and everything begins to unravel for her.  She starts to live in Susan Blue's (the character she is portraying in the film) world.<br /><br />`INLAND EMPIRE' tries really hard, and I think that may be my biggest fault with it.  It is obviously trying.  Laura Dern, an actress that so many of my friends laud and adore (and I personally have found her quite engaging at times) is kind of a mess here.  I know that I'm going to get lambasted here, but I'm just calling it like I see it.  She basically tries to do what Naomi Watts did in `Mulholland Drive' (unsuccessfully) for a good three quarters of the film before she goes entirely off the deep end.  Dern seems a tad lost in the concept of the film.  By concept, I don't mean plot (for that is a tad straightforward).  I mean the directorial vision.  The film is shot like a cheap adult film, grainy and full of imperfections and `too' close-ups.  Dern seems uncomfortable (which may have been the point) but it's not a natural discomfort.  It seems staged.  You can tell she is `playing' uncomfortable.  With Watts, that staginess in the outset of the `Mulholland Drive' served a major purpose when her performance came full circle.  That isn't really the case here.  Dern goes from uncomfortable to full-blown lunatic with no real defining moment to let us know what we are really witnessing.<br /><br />I know that `INLAND EMPIRE' has a point, but it's still rather pointless.  The films central theme seems to be of identity and self reflection (which is exactly what made `Mulholland Drive' so profound) but `INLAND EMPIRE' fails to do that theme any real justice.<br /><br />With a collection of random scenes that somehow are supposed to tie into a `bigger picture', `INLAND EMPIRE' feels lost inside of itself.  I know that many loyalists are going to call me out on this.  Obviously I'm looking at this film wrong (and maybe I am).  Remember, I love David Lynch.  `Eraserhead' is one of the greatest films I've ever seen, but this film loses me.  In the end I'm still giving it a C because it has some redeeming qualities and I will revisit this film to refine my understanding and or opinion of the film.<br /><br />I will throw a positive in this film's direction though.  This is honestly one of the best `sounding' films I've ever seen.  As far as technical merits are concerned, this film nails the sound.  I'm not one who usually calls out a films sound quality, but the whole time I was watching this film I was overtaken with how engaging the film sounded.  Every footstep, door opening, phone ringing, light flickering; it all popped beautifully, and that score was expertly woven into the film to create the desired mood.<br /><br />I only wish that the film itself wereedited better and created a more cohesive tale.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|Everyone saying that this box set is incomplete is retarded. Amazon has simply not listed the synopsis for Season 6, because....well....lets see....its STILL airing on TV. They dont want to give a full synopsis until they are able to summarize the season as a whole. Look at the release date for this box set you tards, it comes out in August, thats 3 months from the series finale on May 23rd. Everyone needs to chill...sheesh.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|After seeing a 12 yr old Joe Bonamassa's performance at a Danny Gatton show on Youtube and reading great reviews about him in the guitar mags, I had to get this DVD. It is one of the best performances I have seen in a long time. Every song is a sonic treat - he is an awesome guitarist and I think he sings well too. There are not many who can stand toe-to-toe with Clapton on a blues number like \\"Further On Up The Road\\", but he more than does so here. You can really tell he is realizing a life long dream by playing at the Royal Albert Hall and with Clapton because of the passion he delivers in each number. The finale, a great medley, with a Gibson Flying V is the definition of energy. The extras introduce you to a rather humble artist of immense talent that we will be hearing more and more about. The DVD itself is technically impressive, although I would have preferred a Blu-ray version. However, on a big flatscreen and audio system cranked to significant decibels, you will not be disappointed - especially if you play guitar. Pretty humbling!
B002ZG98VE|4.0|This was a good prequel and action movie. I was left wanting to see a Robin Hood movie at the end though. I think they should have stuck with the original title of the film \\"Nottingham\\" or even \\"Robin of Locksley\\" then made a sequel called Robin Hood. Some people probably complained about how Robin was a commoner in this film and not the aristocrat that everyone knows him as, but he was actually a commoner in the earliest versions of the story. I hope they release a directors cut like Kingdom of Heaven that made the theatrical version of the film look like crap and a sequel film with Crow actually being Robin Hood.

You don't have to love racing, you don't even have to love dogs, but if you like a nice, easy read, you will love this book.  It is very enjoyable.  Very good author - well written, good story
B001V7YWTQ|3.0|Eric Clapton/Steve Winwood - Live From Madison Square Garden    Lots of reviews on this already but wanted to add my 2 cents worth. Overall, I would say this is less than the sum of the parts and a missed opportunity. For the most part, Clapton dominates this and it feels like another live Clapton show of which there are way too many already. While the musicianship is stellar, nothing here seems to catch fire or be particularly inspired. There was a decent attempt to add some songs not usually played by either of the marquee musicians but many of the tracks fall flat and most have been bettered on previous efforts whether on studio or live tracks from years past.    The reunion of these two was a great idea and long overdue. I have not seen the DVD but just cannot recommend this CD as essential listening for fans of either Clapton or Winwood. Very average stuff - maybe you had to be there to get the magic of the show?
B002G1YPH0|5.0|A very good piece of hardware. Excellent cooling opportunity. I never calculated my cpu temp with stock cooler so cannot comment on how much cooler it runs now as compared to earlier but from the looks of it, my cpu definitely runs at close to ambient temp. This thing is huge after piling it on motherboard above the processor so make sure u have plenty of room in computer case if you are to mount it across the width of the computer case. Furthermore the width of the cooler overshadows the first RAM slot if the RAM slots are build closer to cpu sockets. So those planning on placing 4 RAM sticks may not be able to place all 4 sticks as well as this cooling device. Take caution before ordering the mix of both!!

B002PQ7JQK|4.0|I purchased this recently, and upon receipt feared that a portion of the product was incorrect. The Season 3 shelf-label (sticker on the top that binds the case) reads: \\"The Best of Star Trek: The Original Series, Vol. 3\\" which seemed to indicate that it did NOT contain the entire run of season 3 episodes. I decided against opening the set, and sent an email to customer service requesting information, and whether or not I could return an opened set if it were, in fact, the wrong thing. Instead, they entered a replacement order for me, shipped next-day air at their cost.<br /><br />When the second set arrived, I opened it to find the same thing--the shelf-label saying \\"best of\\" on the season 3 case. I put in a call to customer service to discuss it, and they said it was alright to open one of the sets to check.<br /><br />Turns out the whole of season 3 IS included, and the shelf-label is simply annoyingly misleading. So, I wanted to let everyone else know, in case anyone else notices it and balks as I did.<br /><br />Needless to say, i haven't actually watched any of the discs yet, so I can't vouch for quality, but at least they're what they're advertised to be.
B00371QQ2U|3.0|This first Blu-ray release of Apollo 13 is flawed. However, if enjoy this movie, it will probably be worth relatively low asking price to hold you over while waiting for something better.    As mentioned in other reviews, the loading time of this release is long, and this is in the service of downloading a trailer to show before the main menu and other advertising at the main menu.  It is bad enough that most studios make you skip though trailers that are already on the disc before bringing you to the menu, but this, along with the ad bar that appears once you have finally gotten to the menu ups the irritation factor.  You can disable BD-live on your player to avoid some of this nuisance (it will even let you skip the studio logo), but that is a drastic step.    The presentation provides a significant improvement from the DVD, and is a very worthwhile upgrade.  Unfortunately, contrast boosting, noise reduction, and edge enhancement prevent it from reaching its potential.  This destructive tinkering has been an unfortunate trend of Universal's catalog titles as of late.  Except for a few scenes, these filters have been applied lightly enough that edge halos and waxy textures should not distract.  Still the entire presentation suffers, with scene details that are either crushed or smoothed out, as evidenced by comparisons with the HD-DVD release.  For some releases like Patton, Out of Africa, and reportedly Universal's upcoming Spartacus Blu-ray, the destructive filtering is bad enough to be a deal breaker, but fortunately, that is not the case here.    With Blu-ray's increased capacity, this should have been a better presentation than the HD-DVD, not worse.  While you would still be upgrading to a lossless soundtrack, it is hard to recommend this to owners of the HD-DVD, or those who still have a player and can get the HD-DVD dirt cheap.  As for everyone else, I am tempted to recommend against a purchase in response to Universal's advertising and digital tinkering. Considering the asking price, the presentation still provides more than enough of an upgrade over the DVD with enough good special features for first time purchasers to make it worth the purchase.

0307269752|4.0|My French cousin raved about the \\"Millenium\\" trilogy so I purchased The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo shortly after it's American publication.  I found it a bit slow-going at first but by the end, I did not want to wait one to two years more for the American translations of books 2 and 3.  I had become so entranced with Lisbeth Salander and wanted to know right away what was going to happen.  Since my French cousin was visiting that December, I asked her to bring me the French translations of books 2 and 3 and could not put them down. (It was a good workout of my French as well!)  I found the French translations easier to read and more engaging...I don't know if book one is just naturally slow-to-get-into or whether the translation had anything to do with it since I did not reread book 1 in French.<br /><br />Now it will be interesting to see the movie...although movies are rarely as good as the books for me.  Sorry we won't be getting any more of Mr Larsson's work!

0312427999|4.0|...this might be it, not because it perfectly sums up my personal philosophy, far from it, but because it's amazingly effective at conveying an insanely important message. Even if I didn't lurve Milton Friedman and the ideas he proposes in Capitalism and Freedom I still think this would have been the most difficult book I've ever finished. I came in mad as hell at the military industrial complex and exited even more purple with rage, the abuse of taxpayer dollars by KBR, Haliburton, et al is unfathomable. At a few points Naomi inexplicably doesn't trust the power of her facts and needlessly pours on the dramatic language that, for me, slightly bled the strength of her argument. In her mission to destroy liberal economic thought she refuses to perceive that it could, at least in theory, be uncoupled from the disaster capitalists that needlessly burn resources least their desire for a corporatist state get waylaid by possible consideration for even free market best practices. Also, she ends on a hopeful but seemingly contradictory note. That said, she is a patriot who I think did an immeasurable service for her country.  AUDIOBOOKED

0393324818|5.0|This week I felt like an inverted Cassandra running around wanting to talk about a book that seemingly every sports fan read years ago. Outside of the Hang Up and Listen podcast I don't ruminate on sportz, and refuse to watch any game when multiple friends aren't present, but I was jonesing for more Michael Lewis and his detailing of Billy Beane, the Oakland A's general manager, and the On Base Percentage revolution had me obsessing over MLB like I hadn't done since the sophomore summer when I had four fantasy teams, or the three months in 1994 when all I thought about were Collector's Choice Silver Signature inserts. It's amazing and will change your life. If there is anybody who can make Moneyball into an awesome movie it's Steven Soderbergh.

0393072231|5.0|This dropped in March and it has to be the most compelling book of the year. Lewis takes some almost unknown contrarians, the nitty gritty facts about CDOs, and his own Wall Street experience and fashions together a book that, once on my ipod, got me out of bed and on the first two 5:00 AM runs of my life. The ending is a bit of a downer. But because of his memoir's effect on 80s students Lewis undoubtedly did that on purpose in order to make it clear that he wants to discourage the best and the brightest from pursuing high finance. I might listen to Zuckerman's book also, but I can't believe it won't suffer horribly when compared to this required reading.  AUDIOBOOKED
B0015DROBO|4.0|I was up all night finishing this book. The story is a page-turner, once it ramps up. The characters are compelling. The setting is interesting and different from your run-of-the-mill American crime story. By the end of the book I was ready for more, despite many flaws in the writing. The pacing is too slow in the first third of the book; there are some out-of-place digressions into the specifications of people's computers; the translation often sounds awkward (or possibly the original writing is awkward). But despite these flaws I recommend it for summer reading.
0736092269|5.0|I purchased the second edition of this book back in 2007 and enjoyed reading and researching the movement in here, and when I saw the third edition was released I purchased it. This book is basically an encyclopedia of weightlifting movements, not a training book. Doesn't describe good workouts or anything of the sort, just movements, how to accomplish them and what muscles they work from cover to cover, also includes some stretches and injury preventions that the second edition did not include. Look forward to the fourth edition.

0812973992|5.0|Let the Great World Spin is a collection of short stories ostensibly tied together by the character's connection to the act of a funambulist, who walked between the twin towers of the world trade center in 1974.  However, the characters are actually tied together by a sort of extended family tree portrait that paints a picture of the origins of the life of a particular young woman.<br /><br />Was the writing uneven and lacking focus at times? Yes.  However, I don't think that that distracts from the book at all.  Life is like that.  This book is about life.  If it were consistent, driving, thrilling from page to page, then it wouldn't be as compelling.<br /><br />I tend to rate books by whether or not I though my time was well spent, and worth the few dollars I spent to read it.  In this case, I feel that I was more than amply rewarded by the experience. There were slow points, but it was never a struggle.  When the writing was good, it was brilliant.  When I was done, I was glad to have read it.<br /><br />Finally, a warning for sensitive readers.  I enjoyed the book a great deal, but this is not a book you should read if you have objections to reading about prostitutes, pimps, drug users and fornicators. On the other hand, if you're looking for some salacious reading - you're not going to find that here either :)  It's just about stuff that happens - interesting stuff - but just stuff.

So if you're like me and like your music to be dark, then go listen to Devotion again, and check out Tara Jane O'Neil's \\"A Ways Away.\\"
0061122416|3.0|Like other reviewers of this book, I came at it with fairly low expectations, but I'm very cynical.  I would like to rate this book closer to 7/10, but I feel that it should lose some credibility for implying that alchemy is a legitimate field of study.    After a few pages, it became pretty clear that this story was going to be about as deep as a griddle.  The redeeming characteristics of this work are similar to the things that are valued in classic folk and fairy tales: implied and explicit lessons.  Aesop's fables have little to no character depth, but offer plenty of insight into things that people can use throughout their lives.  Classic German fairy tales don't focus much on the surrounding world and its history, but take much for granted and explore the meanings and effects; this story is not profoundly different.    The story can be viewed in a couple of different ways:  1) The setting is a fantastic recreation of a less technologically advanced version of the world we inhabit, a place where the entire world has sentience.  2) Every single character is mentally unstable.    Having said that, I find it difficult to really paint this book as a lame and superstitious collection of nonsense (much as I would like to).  There are many parts of this work that leave me wondering about the mentality of people who did/do actually believe some of the superstitious fluff; however, there are at least as many places where appeals are made to sound reasoning with good ends.    Some of the messages are utterly blatant, about as subtle as a punch in the face.  This characteristic is not necessarily bad, that should be left up to the reader.  As a whole, the story is entertaining, has a few good points worth pondering/discussing, and is accessible.    If you enjoy best-seller/pulp fiction; this book will not disappoint.  If you are more attracted to stories that resemble dense thickets; this book would be a good companion on a long lay-over, flight, or car-trip (though I would encourage finding it at a library or used book store).

B0039TD7PY|5.0|The music is wonderfully presented by two classic singer/songwriters and the small but talented musicians (Leland Sklar, Russell Kunkel and Danny Kortchmar) assisting on this collaborative effort are outstanding.  Add to the great music the DVD of what appears to have been a magical evening icing on the cake.  Cannot imagine a better gift for the fams of these two tremendous talents than \\"Live at the Troubadour\\".  If you rate Carole King's \\"Tapestry\\" album as a must have, you will enjoy this CD/DVD combo.  If you feel that same way about JT's \\"Mud Slim Slim and the Blue Horizon\\", this CD/DVD will not disappoint you.  Both artists have respect and admiration for one another that comes through loud and clear.
B001FB55L2|5.0|I rented this movie and instantly fell in love with it. I watched it twice the first night, and went online and ordered it right away. It is a remake of a danish film.... It's a captivating story that just draws you in about a family and their struggle with a loved one in the military, going back overseas to fight. As it takes you through this emotional journey of one man's internal battle to get back to his family, you can't help but put yourself in that situation. Once reunited, it continues to show the emotional affects he's left to deal with. In my opinion, brilliant movie.
0307463745|3.0|It's certainly true that continuing with the old tropes of starting a business -- get a business plan, find investors, aim to hire more and faster -- is not necessarily a wise choice in today's environment. In stating that, this book couldn't do better. But, beyond that, this is a lot of high-level cheerleading, and seems to presume the obvious gap in most successful businesses. (E.g., \\"And, first make sure you invent a new form of energy production that will solve all of the world's problems.\\") I hope we don't now see a bunch of people jumping off the cliff of entrepeneurialism without first finding the good idea to fly with.
B002OPZ37E|5.0|I haven't purchased an entire CD in several years, but when I heard the song samples on Amazon I knew I would want most if not all of the songs.      ADTR has the perfect balance of guttural screams and melodic singing.  Their guitar riffs are strong, the drums are solid, and they even throw a few deep bass thumps in periodically.      My only complaint is that it took a little longer than expected for it to ship.
B003405MF6|2.0|I've been fan of Jeff Beck and have enjoyed his music like \\"Guitar Shop\\", \\"You had it Coming\\" or \\"Jeff\\" for a long time.  I purchased this album without hearing it or reading any reviews and that was a mistake I will not make again.  I was very disapointed but hey maybe you will enjoy listening to songs like \\"Somewhere over the rainbow\\", a tribute to Judy Garland etc.? Wow.  Doug
0060935464|5.0|This novel is one of my all time favorites!  Very rarely do I read a book more than once, however this book I read over and over and love it just as much everytime!  :-)  It's a must read!!!!!
0439023483|5.0|The basis of this book is horrible! As a mother, the thought of this actually happening is a nightmare. With that said, it's with that state of mind that I find this story so addictaive! From the first chapter, you feel the main characters emotion, tourment, responsibility, and overall dedication to her family and friends. You feel her heartbreak and her misery, but at the same time, you also understand her survival instinct in a situation where there really is no other option. I was even brought to tears at one point in the book, if you've read it, you probably know the part I am talking about. (bread from Dist. 11) I appreciate the moral struggle the characters go through, and the helplessness they feel. I am hooked and cannot wait for the third book!
B0026P3G12|4.0|I found this album to be very enjoyable and strong except for her version of \\"How Great Thou Art\\", there is more to this song than just the chorus. Susan made a strong showing with all of the other songs but failed drastically with not singing at least one verse of this song. I feel that if all she was going to sing is the chorus, she should have left this song off of the album entirely.
1423121708|5.0|My sons teacher read this book to his 4th grade class. Then we went to see the movie on a filed trip. I had not read the book, but enjoyed the movie. I decided to check out the series, and was hooked. I wanted to get the whole set, but found this one instead. I showed my son, and he loved the idea af the addition of the 8 atrists pictures/paintings. He said it helped him to imagine the setting of the story from the authors view. We decided to buy this special edition, in the hopes that all the books will be given this special treatment as well.
B00275EGWY|3.0|Hurt locker is a weird film. It's focused around the role of  many times forgotten personage in the war, this expert in deactivating deadly, mortal and  sophisticated weapons.<br /><br />Irak, 2004. In the first third of the film we will assist to a sort of documental account. First dealing with the deactivation of two weapons, then the massacre in the desert and finally realizing that nothing can make it to save the life of a n innocent. During the adagio of the film we will watch how these guys spent their free time, and we'll witness how the fraternity of this antihero with a sympathetic child will become an act of personal justice when this boy be murdered by the enemy.<br /><br />The spontaneity of the script is probably its main strength. One can feel that the hazardous and tensional moments are by themselves the dramatic core of the film. Dislike Platoon, for instance, there're not philosophical gestures or the well accustomed dichotomy between the good guys and the bad guys.<br /><br />In Vietnam, you could see your enemy through the eyes of the jungle, but under the inclement heat of the desert, the enemy is invisible. You have not a direct contact with it and so, we have a kind of technological conflagration. You fight against the mortal device not with the enemy, and if case you deal with it the nocturnal sequences demand from you other tactics and procedures.<br /><br />Kathryn Bigelow made an admirable and nervous camera handle, remarking (as Petersen did in Das boot) the anguishing frenzy of being dead or alive in question of seconds where a false movement is just the difference.<br /><br />The film simply doesn't pretend to become a denounce film. It presents us without anesthesia (and in this sense it reminds us to Black hawk) the real situation on the battlefield where the enemy is always behind innocent people used as shield in the most of cases.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers continue to evolve and grow on the fabulous 28 track Stadium Arcadium.  This double CD release has it all:  fast, slow, funky, pop, rock, punk, rap, metal and combos of all the previously mentioned terms.  The lead single tracks Snow and Dani California are very ear catching as well as the spunky Hump De Bump and Warlocks.  Love the drumming on that last piece.  Every time I listen to this CD another tracks just grabs me and I say \\"wow this is one classic batch of tunes!\\" All these tunes are solid but there are about ten...eleven...twelve and growing tracks that are super.  Should I listen to Turn It On Again or Especially In Michigan or Charlie or Animal Bar.  Heck there is just so much to explore in this recording.  You wonder what the guys will put out next.    Anthony Kiedis has developed greatly as a lead vocalist and Chad Smith, Flea and John Frusciante really blend their instruments in perfect harmony like a well oiled machine.  The Peppers have come a long way from their hard core days(not that it was bad, as Blood Sugar Sex Magic was quite griping!)but the band has matured witha ge and that is a good thing.  Its never good to stand still as the Peppers are truly special.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|I can't wait to buy the DVD of Season One. I laugh so hard while watching the show, I miss a lot of the lines. It will be great to watch each episode over and over again.

B00006FR47|5.0|Chicago has had quite a career.  When they started out they were a jam oriented band which implemented horns heavilly into their sound.  Their first three studio releases were loaded with lenghty suite level pieces with a few shorter songs here and there.  Chicago V seems to be a great bridge between the jam oriented band and the more po oriented tunes with great jazz inflections thrown in for good measure.  The lead off song, A Hit By Varese has some cool chord changes which both rocks and bops.  Many great tones exist on this track from nearly every band member.  The two part single Dialogue is an overlooked masterpiee.  The high/low vocals of Terry Kath and Peter Ceterais very captivating.  Throw in the wah wah guitar solo at the end and you have a true gem.  Its a shame AM radio could not appreciate this single even more as its lyrics portrayed a true sign of the times coupled with snappy arrangements.  If you ask me this is the crowning jewel on the recording.    This is not to say Saturday In The Park is is not a worthy single. Its a classic tune and its perfect structure seemed to fit AM radio to a tee.  I guess I like the controlled jamming of Dialogue as well as State of The Union and Goodbye.    Chiago V has a great balance which just might be the groups based work of original material.

1439190275|4.0|The whole idea of the Atkins diet is to regulate your insulin levels. Sine insulin levels determine can both inhibit fat loss and increase fat storage it is a huge piece in the weight loss puzzle. To that end the Atkins Diet cuts down on carbs, to get your body into a state of \\"ketosis\\". Ketosis is most simply put, a point where you're body has limited access to carbs for energy (the bodies first choice), so it begins to use fat for energy.<br /><br />The previous additions of the diet were mostly based on Dr. Atkins and his ideas, though many people had gotten great results. Since the last edition several studies have been done, most show that Atkins is superior to most other \\"fad\\" diets. There have also been studies that show most of the initial wieght loss is related to losing water.<br /><br />Either way, I think this works and I did lose about 10 lbs in weeks. However, I lift weights and exercise a lot and after a couple weeks I couldn't do it any more. I just too tired all of the time, even when bumping my carbs up a little bit. This may not be the case for you but I found that I felt terrible while on the this diet eventhough I followed all of the suggestions.<br /><br />Again, it does work but I found it to be hard to stay on. First, as mentioned above, it may not suit you if you started up a training program. I also found that even though I'm a huge carnivore that it was really hard to eat what you need to eat on this diet. However, for some this may not be much of an issue.<br /><br />This version of the book has a lot more hints and a lot more simple. The diet works, if you can stay on it you will get results.

B001GCUO1Q|4.0|Director Gavin Hood pulls together an enjoyable, if not especially profound, survey of the most popular X-Man's missing years.  Moving mainly in fits and starts through most of two centuries, it shows how a sickly young boy becomes an angry fighter, shrugs off mortal wounds, and loses interest in being alive.  And then, at the last moment, he rediscovers what he believes in--and it costs him everything.<br /><br />Hood teases out little hints dropped in the prior movies, turning disconnected images into a coherent narrative.  Though nothing particularly surprising or revelatory takes place, the film at least acquits itself with a number of good set pieces, a realistic science fiction conflict and rationally motivated characters.  It does a good job setting up where Wolverine came from, and opening doors for where he might go.<br /><br />And the acting is strong.  Hugh Jackman proves once again that he's able to carry off an action hero who suffers the full range of human emotions.  Danny Huston's Colonel Stryker is smart but in love with his own intelligence.  And who knew brainy Liev Schreiber could hulk out and play such a powerful villain?  If there's a real shock in this film, it's a  previously unseen side of Schreiber.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is good.  While it lacks the moving intensity of the first two X-Men movies, it entertains and engages, pulling viewers through a story that keeps us hooked as we wait to see secrets revealed.  X-Men fans and action movie devotees will find plenty to like in this fun, muscular film.
B001FB55LC|5.0|This was a very good movie.  I really enjoyed it.  I was able to identify with each character.  You could feel the love they had for each other.
6305609705|5.0|Watching this movie more than thirty years after its initial release, I realize that it doesn't look old.  You know that look old movies get, where the color washes out and the sound turns mushy?  Not only does this movie not make any of those mistakes, it doesn't even indulge in cheesy disco-era special effects or camera moves that would make it look dated.  This movie could have been released the week before last.    This film is famously based on Joseph Conrad's [[ASIN:0393926362 Heart of Darkness]], and if you've read the book, the parallels are unmistakable.  But this brings the story into the realm of living memory.  My freshman students didn't understand the magnitude of events in the book until they saw this movie.  This film viscerally dramatizes a man's descent into destruction at the hands of grasping, self-immolating empire.    There is literally no one to whom I would not recommend this movie.  Though it's violent, it's never gratuitous, so I can recommend it to pacifists.  Though it's male-dominated, it doesn't glorify masculinity, so I can recommend it to feminists.  Though it's old, it remains timely, so I can recommend it to young adults.  And though I love it, it's both profound and universal, so I can recommend it to you.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|I coincidentally read Mr. Sledges book a month before 'The Pacific' came on HBO. It is regarded by many as the best book written about the Marines in the pacific in WWII.It is incredibly moving, as it not only covers the battles, but the day to day living conditions the Marines had to endure. As a Marine infantry veteran myself,this book reinforces the memory and sacrifice of all the Marines who sacrificed so much. Read this book!  You will not be disappointed.
B0021L8V1G|4.0|This lightning-fast, overstuffed sequel is plenty of fun.  And when I say \\"plenty,\\" I mean there's more going on than in any season of most TV shows.  This movie has so many irons in the fire (pardon the pun) that keeping up with them is a job.  If I had to find one fault with this film, there is so much awesome content that I can't keep all of it straight.  A little trimming might not be amiss.<br /><br />Months after revealing his secret identity, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark as Iron Man (got that?) has brought world peace, become even more of a celebrity, and lost control of his life.  So he promoted his assistant to CEO, hires Scarlett Johanssen to keep his schedule, and gives Nick Fury the cold shoulder.  But he has secret rivals: Mickey Rourke wants to reclaim his father's legacy, and Don Cheadle as Rhodey wants Stark tech in U.S. Army hands.<br /><br />For a movie stuffed with lickety-split comic book action, this one also carries a lot of smart character development, dry humor, and real-world political commentary.  But you already know that if you saw the first one.  This one contains no surprises; it just pushes the dynamics from the first film to even greater heights of accomplishment.  It's not so much a sequel as the second half of a single film.<br /><br />But as I say, it's overstuffed.  It runs 125 minutes, a hair shorter than the original, but feels much longer.  Between business, politics, romance, heroism, military, and more, this movie has more threads running through than a knitters' convention.  Not one of them is poor, and I loved them all, but when a character comes back after a thirty-minute absence and I can't recall who that is, the film is too busy.<br /><br />This movie made me laugh, cheer, and think.  I enjoyed it.  It has good set pieces, smart characters, an energetic story, and plenty to keep a diverse audience engaged.  I just wish it were a little slimmer, so I could keep all the numerous story elements in mind.

B001FB55HQ|1.0|This movie is so massively wrong-headed, and so overtly throws sod on the original Terminator film, that I can only assume it's deliberate.  I can only conclude that director McG and the small army of writers who held this film in development hell for several years purposely want to sour you and me on James Cameron's 1984 classic.  What other explanation can there be for such transparent awfulness?    Deep in the violence of post-nuclear 2018, John Connor (Christian Bale) struggles as a low-ranking officer in the Resistance.  Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), executed by the state fifteen years earlier, awakes not one day older, already in the thick of fighting.  But in a matter of hours, Wright finds the one thing both the Machines and Connor need: the current location of young Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin).    The original Terminator flourished by taking common fears and making them happen on screen before us.  Because many of us distrust ordinary technology, Cameron's 1984 film is justly considered a classic.  This film, by contrast, seems written as a showcase for the special effects.  There is not one moment of tension, not one revealing human moment, not one point at which I feel this movie is telling the truth.    This film suffers innumerable orchestrated set pieces, fight sequences, and explosions.  Everything is tightly so choreographed, I never get the feeling anything has really happened.  If you doubt what I mean, I commend to your imagination the image of a CGI Arnold, head surrounded by a halo of anti-aliasing artifacts, tossing Christian Bale like a Frisbee.  Yeah, the whole movie is like that.    Then we have all the bits and bobs stolen from other, better sci-fi movies.  You could make a drinking game out of spotting them all.  Beer for Star Wars, wine for The Matrix, liquor for Spielberg's War of the Worlds.  Make 'em double shots for images taken from sequels.  I saw not one original set piece, line of dialog, or piece of physical design in this entire 118-minute disaster.    Cameron's original Terminator was one of the greatest works of film ever.  The second film was good.  The third was adequate.  This one is awful.  I don't throw negative superlatives around, because they get abused, but this is the worst film I've seen in at least three years.  I will watch no more Terminator films.  I love the original too much to see the franchise desecrated this way.
B001LMRCP2|5.0|Listen to 'Life In Technicolor II' and tell me that this album should be rated an average of four stars...this is OVER five star material. Glasses of Water, Rainy Day, the lyrics in 'Prospekts March' are phenomenal. The Jay-Z remix is okay, nothing spectacular but entertaining nonetheless.<br /><br />Coldplay never ceases to amaze me. Every time I listen to a coldplay album I get 100% focused on their music. This album is a perfect example. From the power driven 'Life In Technicolor II' to the last line in 'Now My Feet Won't Touch The Ground', Prospekts March' is fantastic.<br /><br />Had 'Strawberry Swing' been included on this album I would say it was better than 'Viva La Vida'. Coldplay has become one of my favorite bands and this album can explain why. Plus, at $5.99 (as of May 2010) it is a steal.<br /><br />5/5

0446679089|3.0|DeMille reliably knows how to build up suspense and add plenty of local color to make his characters come to life. This time, we are on the LI North Shore where the murders of a scientist couple are discovered. An NYPD detective on sick leave gets involved in trying to solve the case. Some biological warfare scenarios -- the scientist worked in a microbiology lab -- make for additional drama. Things get a bit lengthy at times, for instance during an interminable trek by the investigating team through the lab facilities. But suspension largely suvives these drag-on narratives. For a first-time deMille reader, this is a great book. For repeat-readers, though, his stock character of a relentlessly sarcastic smart aleck who outwits all the hi-falutin' snobs who try to interfere with his quest becomes a bit tiresome. But what is truly grossing a reader out after a few deMille novels, this one included, is the author's proclivity to dwell on his middle-aged to elderly protagonists' sexual proclivities. For a young reader especially, it is rather unpleasant to imagine deMille's well-worn characters think, talk and behave like horny teenagers. But that's a matter of style. As a well-crafted mystery with a decent plot, good local color and only occasional lengthiness, this novel gets three stars from this reader.
B000MTOLDG|5.0|A fantastic album with a good mix of faster songs (Burner, On your feet, .. ) with slower (well, slightly!) paced songs packing awesome riffs (Sword, Born to raise Hell & esp. Liar).

B002ZG98VO|5.0|First of all this is NOT a kid's version of Robin Hood. This version tells the story of the origins of the legend. This is a very violent movie with numerous casualties. I will not go into too many details so I won't ruin the plot. Needless to say people should visit[...]  and look up the crusades so they would be able to follow the story easier. Parents should see this movie before considering taking minor children under the age of 13 to go see it due to the violence and they might not be able to follow the history behind the story. In fact this movie should be rated R as some of the violence is quite graphic.

The music that Natalie Merchant composed to accompany far-reaching and varied poets is set to wonderfully varied mix of styles (from Klezmer, Irish folk, and zydeco/low country).  Mellow-folk, rather than kid sing-along.   It is a true bargain if you get the book, and cd set.
0887307280|3.0|As a design professional working for a startup, here is what I took away from the book:<br /><br />Good:<br /><br />Nicely defines the 3 personalities that go into making a company.<br /><br />Displays an easily understandable division between doing the work \\"in-the-trenches\\" and the \\"big picture\\" work of setting up a company to run like a well-oiled machine. Gerber argues for a system of designing the company that can be readily reproduced in most any location with most any people. It might be said that this is the AK-47 model of business: a design so good that it works successfully even when shoddy materials are used in its creation, That even the most basic workers will suffice because the business plan ensures a high minimimum-level of quality.<br /><br />Bad:<br /><br />Overly dependent on rules, rather than on good employees. Runs a great risk of micromanagement through it's encouragement of tightly-controlled behaviour. In such a system it seems that common sense would be discarded in favor of following the rulebook to the letter when an unexpected situation arises. Gerber's system of rule-making appears to be rather inflexible in dealing with unique situations on a case-by-case basis.<br /><br />As Fast Company has said of hiring: \\"Many companies fail from the start by talking down to their new hires and using training materials geared for the lowest common denominator.\\" The E-Myth method is geared entirely towards recruiting the lowest common denominator, the most basic worker that could accomplish the job. While it's good for success to be dependent more on a solid business plan than any individual employee, Gerber doesn't seem to account for the superior customer experience that one receives when collaborating with employees that meet more than the minimum requirements.<br /><br />His model is primarily applicable to retail shops and other businesses that have multiple locations. It does not address the business plan of the design studio or other creative ventures. As a matter of fact, the book belittles the role of the craftsman and doesn't do justice to creative professionals.<br /><br />---<br /><br />I would prefer to rate it 3 1/2 stars; very good, but not great. As it stands, it's still worth a read, just keep in mind that too many rules in a business can easily suffocate the work atmosphere.role of the craftsman and doesn't do justice to creative professionals.    ---    I would prefer to rate it 3 1/2 stars; very good, but not great.

B0034BW9CO|5.0|When I heard Royce's cover of \\"Stand By Me\\" I was unsure of whether the other songs would be good or not since some artists can only make hits by covering famous hits from previous artists. However the songs on this album are very good actually. If you like Aventura's \\"gods project\\" and \\"the last\\" albums as well as Toby Love's debut album, you will like this one for sure. It has the modern bachata sound while still being different from that of aventura or toby love as it should since Royce wrote or co-wrote every song on the album.    Pretty much every song is radio friendly material and no song is filler/album material as it feels like listening to a hits album song after song. It is basically one of those albums where the songs dont grow on you because you actually like them from the instant you hear them and thats whats really nice about it. I highly recommend this album, its definitely worth getting if youre a fan of modern bachata.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|Stadium Arcadium is a true gem.  It has it all:  rock, pop, funk, metal, rap and various combos.  Some may say the band sold out but I say they have grown into a band that can adapt to many audiences.  Anthony KIedis has improved tremendously as a vocalist and the band blends in very well with their insturments and on harmonies.<br /><br />Every time I listen to this CD, I find a new song that grabs me.  What can I say?  This CD is a true feast for the ears.  The singles Snow and Dani California grabbed me right away as did the funky Hump De Bump.  But today it was Epecially in Michiagan and a few days ago it was Tell Me Baby.  Last Week it was  Turn It Again and  the day before it was Wet Sand.  Who knows what tommorow will bring?<br /><br />The softer toned songs are fine too. Balance is always a good thing.  28 tracks and all of them are winners. And about a dozen are just fabulous.
0385338910|5.0|If you've read Tropper at all, you'll easily recognize Doug Parker, our protagonist for How To Talk To A Widower, as Zack from Everything Changes and Judd from This Is Where I Leave You. He's a wise-cracking, self-deprecating dude's dude with a slightly off-kilter family and a complicated relationship with women. Normally if you read several books by the same author, and the main character in each of those books is pretty much the same guy, you'd be annoyed and probably scream \\"Unoriginal! Repetitive!\\"  But Jonathan Tropper manages to pull this off. How? It's easy: His prose reads like a 330 pages of stand-up comedy, so you don't really mind that he doesn't spend a whole lot of time on character development. But beyond his wonderful prose, I love reading Tropper because his stories have heart, and are just so, for lack of a better word, true.<br /><br />In this novel, the angle is that Doug's wife Hailey, 11 years his senior, has died in a plane crash (Doug is 29). And so he's spent the last year grieving -- which has limited his activity to drinking heavily, feeling sorry for himself, occasionally yelling at people who express sympathy, and writing a monthly column for a magazine about how to talk to a widower. But Doug's twin sister Claire, who has her own relationship dilemmas, convinces him that he needs to get back into the dating pool. Meanwhile, he's also charged with the care of his wife's 16-year-old son from a previous marriage, who is angry at the world, as teenagers are. Hilarity ensues.<br /><br />But, again, the fun derived from this novel is directly attributable to the writing. Want some examples?  Sure, no problem: \\"Pity, I've learned, is like a fart. You can tolerate your own, but you simply can't stand anyone else's.\\" Too low-brow?  Then this'll really make you wince: \\"I've never been to an OB/GYN office before, and you can almost see fractal bends in the air from all the estrogen floating around in here.\\"<br /><br />I read the last 200 pages of this novel on a plane in a feverish, barely-looking-up trance.

0312427646|5.0|Alan Bennett is one prolific and talented writer. From Beyond the Fringe (with Pete, Duds and Dr. Miller back in the `60s) to such stage hits as The Madness of King George III and The History Boys and movies such as Prick Up Your Ears and A Private Function and the current London smash The Habit of Art, he continues to surpass himself. An Uncommon Reader has just caught up with us, and we'll never be the same. Some books change your way of looking at the world; some change your life. Not only does this novella do both and more, it'll make you smile, laugh, giggle, guffaw and maybe even chortle. It tells the story of Queen Elizabeth II, who blames her dogs entirely for what transpires in the 120 pages. The book is not terribly full of action or incident, yet in a way it's more about discovery than thousands of geography books, and more about what we are obligated to do for happiness than can be believed. It's a book that teaches us we are never too old or too blas&eacute; to be shocked by a queen.
0312370849|1.0|A friend recommended this book...she'll still be my friend but I'll think twice about her recommendations, after reading this one! Please read the succinct and eloquent negative reviews about this poorly composed book before you waste money on it. Julia, the protagonist, just doesn't sound true to life. Would you find it believable that a 45-year-old woman who has had umpteen (she mentioned at least 5) miscarriages would break the exciting news of her latest pregnancy to her unfaithful husband within hours of her pregnancy test, totally confident that she was going to bear this child? Just one small example of how irritating and time-wasting this book was. There are hundreds of memoirs of the Holocaust--why read fictional accounts? Read \\"Leap into Darkness\\", for one.
B002ZRPQ5K|2.0|I've been a fan of Keane for several years, they provided a nice alternative to Coldplay with great production and a distinct sound.<br />But this album is just dreadful!  Night Train is everything that Keane was not...drum machines, cheesy mix of rap and singing...covers of overused theme songs like Rocky!<br />If you want a good idea of how bad this album is just listen to the sample of Looking Back - in all fairness it's the worst tune on the album but the rest is not much better.<br />Tom Chaplin, the lead singer, has a great voice...there is no need for any guest singer - especially ones that don't pair well with him.<br />If you want to try out Keane go for Under the Iron Sea, or Hopes and Fears - both are excellent 4 star deserving and I think are more indicative of their true roots.<br />Maybe they are trying something new here, but the best songs are the ones that remind me of the Keane of old such as My Shadow.<br />Hopefully they'll go back to the old sound on the next album...in the meantime this is a big disappointment.
B002ZG98VE|4.0|Saw this today and still trying to come to grips with expectation versus reality.. in the last 10 minutes of this movie you WILL realize --    \\"The first thing to know about director Ridley Scott's and actor Russell Crowe's \\"Robin Hood\\" is that this is not a \\"Robin Hood\\" movie.  This is a Robin Longstride movie.  This story happens before all of the action and people you know and love from many previous tellings. Robin Longstride is not yet an outlaw known as Robin the Hood or Robin Hood; Marion is not a maid; there's no taking from the rich and giving to the poor; the merry men have yet to band.\\"    Going into this I didn't know that info.. kinda wish I had, and a little confused why they didn't try to work that info into the title somehow -- even though the battles are epic and the presentation is beyond impressive I kept wondering -- why am I watching a movie about France and England at war? There's a reason. They are showing HOW Robin Longstride (Hood) became the wanted man I was waiting 140 minutes for him to be. I cannot hold ambition against a movie filled with great acting and production values -- still, I feel a little cheated.    Robin Hood - 4 out of 5 (but there better BE a damn sequel)
B00006FR47|5.0|Chicago has had quite a career. When they started out they were a jam oriented band which implemented horns heavilly into their sound. Their first three studio releases were loaded with lenghty suite level pieces with a few shorter songs here and there. Chicago V seems to be a great bridge between the jam oriented band and the more po oriented tunes with great jazz inflections thrown in for good measure. The lead off song, A Hit By Varese has some cool chord changes which both rocks and bops. Many great tones exist on this track from nearly every band member. The two part single Dialogue is an overlooked masterpiee. The high/low vocals of Terry Kath and Peter Ceterais very captivating. Throw in the wah wah guitar solo at the end and you have a true gem. Its a shame AM radio could not appreciate this single even more as its lyrics portrayed a true sign of the times coupled with snappy arrangements. If you ask me this is the crowning jewel on the recording.<br /><br />This is not to say Saturday In The Park is is not a worthy single. Its a classic tune and its perfect structure seemed to fit AM radio to a tee. I guess I like the controlled jamming of Dialogue as well as State of The Union and Goodbye.<br /><br />Chiago V has a great balance which just might be the groups based work of original material.

0670021652|4.0|The strange thing about this follow up to Eat Pray Love is that accounting to the author the first draft of this book was written before EPL became the best-seller it is today. I'm a little sceptical myself as `sequel' books such as these are often little more than money grabbers and never seem to amount to anything like the brilliant original pieces. Of course if Gilbert can be believes Committed is nothing of the sort, and perhaps I should just throw my cynicism aside and review the actual book.<br /><br />As you should already remember from EPL, Gilbert has hooked up with a new foreign beau, and has a new lease on life. Committed begins as that new life begins to slide out of their grasp, thanks to a Southern customs agent getting suspicious of Philipe's comings and goings (he continually applied for temporary working visas in order to constantly travel into America to see Gilbert)<br /><br />Perhaps merely being sarcastic the border agent suggests the two get married, and so begins Gilbert's almost obsessive foray into researching marriage and what is means. Unlike EPL Committed is mostly devoted to the topic of marriage, rather than biographing Gilbert's life. I don't want to be harsh, but I honestly preferred it. By far the highlights of this book are the historical summaries, I found the sections devoted to Gilbert's life to be somewhat yawn-worthy.<br /><br />Of particular note are Gilbert's writings on conservative views on marriage in America (written with no less than the expected left-minded fiery scorn) and a very interesting piece towards the end on the subversive nature of marriage and families. A thesis which summarises to describe societies or those in charge of always trying but ultimately failing to control the family unit, the family unit being a constantly variable grouping dependant on the choices of the individuals included.<br /><br />At under 300 pages Committed is a short read with few surprises, still much better than much of the sclub out there

0316017922|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell examines the factors which lead to success in his book [[ASIN:0316017922 Outliers: The Story of Success]].  He begins with a popular theme in American culture: the person who begins life with every disadvantage but eventually overcomes those forces through sheer force of will and becomes successful in his or her chosen field.  Our heroes are people who we believe have done just that.  Gladwell argues that with closer examination we can see that this is often a myth.  People often achieve success because key doors have been opened to them, and they were willing to take advantage of those open doors. But these people also are willing to work hard to be successful.  He gives several examples that range from The Beatles to Bill Gates.  He also looks on the negative side of this as well.  Various factors can often lead to failure when we don't identify them early.  All this leads to the conclusion that while some forces are out of our control, as a culture we squander talent in many areas because we don't find ways to open doors for people who could be successful.<br /><br />This is a book full of big ideas that could help transform the lives of many people who need a shot at success, but it would take buy-in from many powerful people to put this into practice.  Gladwell presents his evidence carefully, and his analysis is excellent.  The question is whether our culture is willing to learn from these lessons.

B001KOFH2G|4.0|I'm glad I bought Firefly & Serenity.  I had never seen the show when it was on network TV so all I had to go on were the reviews.  I can see why the show didn't make it which is a shame because as we see with Serenity & beyond it would have been worth it to give it a real chance.  Serenity isn't a great movie but it is so very sweet of JW to send this sort of DVD love letter to the fans (even down to the last speech about love) who are still preaching the word of Firefly (and generating cash) even tho' the show was canceled 5 years ago.  Rarely do you see something done on this scale just for the fans (this movie doesn't hold much water without knowing in the series) and it's why I gave Serenity the extra star.  It was a fitting farewell.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I have to admit to being absolutely addicted to this series.  The writer's are excellent and the MUSIC choices that compliment the scenes are extraordinary. I can honestly say I have never seen a better character/actor match than that of Damon/Ian Somerhalder.  Nearly every episode has a scene that I could watch over-and-over.  I am so impressed with the direction of the characters.  Subtle \\"reactions\\" make the show so much fun to watch.<br /><br />Just a couple of my favorite examples: (There are SO many others!)<br />Spoilers for those who haven't seen the show<br /><br />Episode 7:  Despite the attraction between Damon and Elena, she gets upset with him and at one point slaps him in the face.  He turns one of his famous \\"looks\\" at her and it's like she just then realizes that she just slapped a vampire(!) I just love her reaction and then his subsequent one.  (great scene)<br /><br />Episode 11: The opening scene is Damon saving Elena from a car accident/vampire.  The tenderness of Damon is a rewind-magnet.<br /><br />Episode 17:  Incredible segment (and song choice!) for the scene at Matt's house after Vicky's death.  (One of the 2 most notable song choices of the season)<br /><br />Episode 18: Elena invites Damon over to her house to talk about Stefan.  (great scene!)<br />Favorite quote: Elena to Damon:.. \\"Stefan isn't you..He isn't even close\\" Damon: \\"Well, he doesn't want to be me..but that doesn't mean deep down that he's not\\" (knowing look of their attraction)<br /><br />Episode 19: Dance scene between Damon and Elena (Music Choice again) The words of the song as they dance :\\"Can you still see the heart of me? All my agony fades away when you hold me in your embrace. Don't turn me down for all I need, make my heart a better place, give me something I can believe.  Don't turn it down, what's left of me, make my heart a better place.\\" (Best song choice of the season/INCREDIBLE when you understand the character of Damon) Try watching THAT without tears!<br /><br />Episode 21: Damon confronts Isobel....Favorite quote: Damon:\\"I DO believe in killing the messenger...you know why....because it sends a message\\"<br /><br />Episode 22: (Season finale) Damon and \\"Elena\\" kiss ......and incredible cliff-hanger!<br /><br />I can't wait for Season 2.

0385523386|5.0|You are right if you think that this book was written by a well-educated, well-connected, young woman who ended up in our federal prison system as a result of her rebelliousness following her time at Smith College.  Condemn her for her crime as our justice system did, if you must; but, don't make the mistake of condemning Orange Is the New Black just because of Piper's background. It's because of this very background that she takes full responsibility for her actions and is able to describe her journey through the federal correction system in such an articulate and sensitive way.  It's also because of this background, and this book, that she is able to facilitate a forum for the important discussion this country needs to have about sentencing and prison reform.<br /><br />Regardless of the lens through which you read the book, I urge you to read it, form your own opinions, and then engage in the discussion.

B001VNB54A|5.0|First let me say that HBO, Steven Spielberg, and Tom Hanks deserve a standing ovation for making this epic piece of history. I just finished watching the last episode. Once I saw the first episode, I was mesmerized for the next 9 weeks! I scheduled everything on Sunday around watching \\"The Pacific\\".  Outstanding acting, incredible cinematography, great music score, realism that is scary! I'm running out of superlatives to use! It's not better, than BOB! It's just as good and just as heart warming, and gut wrenching as BOB. Both of these historical mini-series deserve equal credit. Don't let some of the reviews here influence your judgement not to watch it. Yes there are those that feel strongly about one or another, but I don't believe that was anyone's goal in making the Pacific. I believe, especially Tom Hanks, just has this compelling, passionate desire to put both theaters of WWII in the minds of both, those that served and those of us who have not. The mellow drama movies of post WWII lead many of us who did not serve, to think about WWII as a hero's time in history. I would never discount any heroics which there are plenty to be seen, It's just that both of these series, Band of Brothers, and The pacific, set the stage for us to all share in the reality of war. Some reviewers here have commented on how there feelings were evoked while watching, In a few words, I felt like I was there each week, and each week after watching an episode, I would look at there reality and think about my past week, good or bad and feel proud to be an American Citizen!     I'm an aging baby boomer, 64, and my Father, who is 88, and still with us, was a ambulance driver on the front lines in Germany, France, and a few other countries. My father also suffered from some of the mental duress from his time served. With this Memorial Day Holiday upon us very soon, I would like to say a very sincere, Thank You, to ALL who have served in ALL the wars that have helped make the United Statesof America a country I'm still proud of.    Mr. Spielberg, and Mr. Hanks, Please do what ever you can to bring more of these fine mini-series covering the Korean War, the Viet-Nam War, and both Iraq, and Afghanistan Wars. They deserve your serious passion, commitment, and wonderful talents! My Mother was an English WWar II Bride, so let's just say Hip, Hip, Hooray!    I've already ordered my Blue-Ray release of \\"The Pacific\\"      Outstanding!

0393072231|5.0|This book should be rated 6 stars if such rating existed. Michael Lewis manages to top his masterpiece Liar's Poker with an even more thrilling account of the events that led to the recent financial crisis. Although most of us are aware of the fundamental cause of the crisis being the sub-prime mortgages, this book sheds light on the pivotal role that the rating agencies played in creating it. Michael presents the events from both angles, the entities that were long and the shorts who were betting on the melt-down of the financial system. Through reading this book, one does not only learn the events, but learns how to analyze like the financial managers on Wall-Street. This book can be viewed as an investor's guide to irrational market. Michael does a great job at the end to relate this piece of work to Liar's Poker and to show how what he talked about then, came to life now in the form of a crisis. One quote I particularly enjoyed is:<br /><br />\\"The line between gambling and investing is artificial and thin. The soundest investment has the defining trait of a bet (you loosing all of your money in hopes of making a bit more), and the wildest speculation has the salient characteristic of an investment (you might get your money back with interest). Maybe the best definition of \\"investing\\" is \\"gambling with the offs in your favor.\\"<br /><br />In short, if you wanted to read one book to truly understand the financial crisis, this should definitely be the one. Highly recommended!
B0035F0MTG|2.0|On this new album, out of 33 tracks, Ms. Yu Jia Wang has put up 30 tracks that are showy and technically demanding.<br />The pieces are IMPECCABLY performed TECHNICALLY. They are absolutely clean, accurate, rhythmically FLEETING, and even if not exactly, LOUD AND powerful, possessing a prowess of the WILL BUT NOT the SOUL that no listener would miss.<br />Sure as hell, Yu Jia has a sound technique, but her musical maturity remains to be tested in full rigor on a quieter and more introverted choice than the present one, as well as her debut album `Etudes and Sonatas'.<br />The youngster has ideas - ideas that suggest that to her at least, the form of music determines the musicality, as demonstrated by her choices in these two albums.<br />She may have a point. But I would loath to say that music rests on form. If the choice of pieces have the `link' as Yu Jia mentioned, it must be a link of the abstract sound world, detached from humanity and emotions. This is testified by the obvious fact that the two Scarlatti sonatas are among the most musically boring interpretation I have ever heard. Just imagine, Horowitz used to be a great Scarlatti interpretor!<br />As I have mentioned in her first album's review, this youngster has a bright career in jazz, but not necessarily in classical music.

B002JVWR9U|5.0|\\"The Vampire Diaries\\" is the latest addition to a delightfully growing genre of gothic romance based on vampire lore. Playing like a teenage/young adult version of \\"True Blood,\\" the first season of \\"The Vampire Diaries\\" is engaging, intense, and ultimately as addictive as the human blood drained by the lead characters.<br /><br />\\"The Vampire Diaries\\" tells the story of Elena Gilbert (Nina Dobrev), a serious and strong-willed girl who has just lived through personal tragedy and is trying to wake back up to the real world in the small, mysterious town of Mystic Falls, Virginia. Elena's life is quickly and irrevocably complicated by the arrival of two brothers in her life: Stefan and Damon Salvatore (Paul Wesley and Ian Somerhalder, respectively), two young men of wildly different temperament, both attractive, both somewhat unhealthily interested in her...and both vampires.<br /><br />As Elena is entangled in a web of increasingly dangerous dark side mythology, she finds that the world around her is not what she knew as the bloody and fascinating history of Mystic Falls begins to come alive around her, leading to shocking revelations and violent twists. As Elena learns of her and her friends' connections to the bloody vampiric past, a mysterious new history teacher (Matt Davis) with a hidden past has the power to shed shocking light on Elena's past, leaving viewers breathless for each new episode and ending the season on an explosive cliffhanger so tense it leaves viewers' hearts pounding in fear and excitement in equal turns.<br /><br />\\"The Vampire Diaries\\" succeeds, first and foremost, on the strength of its characters. Elena is a grave young girl who has a fiercely strong core. She is unafraid to stand up for what she believes in, and it is her iron will that guides her through her dealings with the Salvatore brothers. She is never weak or overwhelmed when dealing with Stefan's vampire nature -- she falls in love with Stefan *despite* the fact that he is a vampire, rather than because of it. It is the strength of her heart that breaks through to the human buried beneath the darker Damon, though the consequences of that awakening may be more brutal than Elena had counted on.<br /><br />Stefan is a delightfully nuanced character, at once taking some cues from \\"Angel\\" but retaining a new energy. Stefan's struggles with both his way of life and his dealings with Damon are intensely real. And as for Damon? How long has it been since we've seen television vampires who take genuine glee in their immortality? As the body count stacks up at Damon's feet, he is at turns hilariously over-the-top and terrifyingly evil. It's always unsettling to see the youthful and beautiful faces of the vampires change at a moment's notice to a twisted, ugly and veiny countenance.<br /><br />\\"The Vampire Diaries\\" also hosts a truly fascinating cast of secondary characters who each has their own story to tell: Elena's younger brother Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen), a brooding presence whose unhealthy ways of dealing with grief are intensely empathetic; Elena's best friend Bonnie (Katerina Graham), who discovers that she is a powerful witch and as directly linked to Mystic Falls' nightmarish past as Elena herself; Caroline (Candice Accola), a strong-willed girl who hides her strength behind her personality; Matt (Zach Roerig), Elena's ex-flame who fires the screen with his brooding presence; and many more distinct and sometimes mysterious inhabitants of the strange town of Mystic Falls. The setting itself is so realistic and so integral to the story that it almost becomes a character in and of itself, speaking to the quality of the writing.<br /><br />The series deals with teenage issues in an adult manner, never condescending to its audience by opening up to viewers of all ages. The vampires of the show have moments of real horror, reminding viewers that any creature that has to drink the blood of the living in order to survive is not to be trusted; there is enough fierce action and slight gore to keep viewers engaged while the romantic elements of the plot simmer with tension so tight that the explosions of passion are nearly as violent as the fight scenes themselves.<br /><br />\\"The Vampire Diaries\\" is a fun, fresh, and sharply-written supernatural drama that is sure to attract a strong fanbase. It certainly doesn't hurt that all of the actors are both attractive and talented and that the history of the town is as engaging as its present. Ultimately, \\"TVD\\" is a strong, bloodthirsty and fast-paced ride, and it just may be enough to prove to the world that the vampire genre still has plenty of bite left in it yet.<br /><br />5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />NOTE: \\"The Vampire Diaries\\" is based on the series of novels of the same name by teenage author of the '90's, LJ Smith; however, the show deviates strongly from the novels in many positive ways -- no longer is Elena a shallow blonde beauty queen; no longer is Stefan an overbearing, brooding bore, no longer is Damon a callow and irritating bad guy. While fans of the book series may take issue with the differences between the novels and the series, non-fans and those who have never read the novels are certainly not missing much by watching the show rather than reading the books.iewers engaged while the romantic elements of the plot simmer with tension so tight that the explosions of passion are nearly as violent as the fight scenes themselves.    \\"The Vampire Diaries\\" is a fun, fresh, and sharply-written supernatural drama that is sure to attract a strong fanbase.

B000LPS47U|5.0|Few films hold such a huge cult following and incredible camp value as Stuart Gordon's RE-ANIMATOR. Jeffrey Combs stars as the petulant Dr. Herbert West, a man obsessed with restoring brain and muscle activity in recently deceased bodies. After unlocking the secret re-agent needed to bring back the dead, West is blindsided by a greedy professor that intends on claiming the discovery as his own, and it is up to he and a fellow student to stop a group of undead corpses that are resurrected as a result of the misuse of his formula. Combs is iconic in this, his most memorable role. His manic behavior is contrasted by Bruce Abbott's timid performance as Dan Cain, the voice of reason behind West's brilliant insanity. RE-ANIMATOR is filled with bloody gore and gratuitous nudity (care of genre favorite Barbara Crampton), setting the bar for countless films to follow and defining what 80s Horror was all about. Dennis Paoli's dark script adds a wicked humor to H.P. Lovecraft's original short, which is grown organically out of the absurd situations rather than cheap gags or slapstick. The greatest of these moments involve David Gale as Dr. Hill's disembodied head as he commands his bumbling body to assist him in his nefarious schemes. Many of the FX may seem silly to younger audiences that have been spoiled by the countless advances in make-up design and computer imaging, but the prosthetic work and creative framing used in RE-ANIMATOR are clever low-cost techniques that were both effective and ground-breaking for the time. Stuart Gordon's breakthrough hit is an unmistakable Horror classic that is just as hilarious and entertaining today as it was 25 years ago, and is a must-own for every genre fan.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
B002ZG98VE|5.0|The story of Robin Hood has been told in films with different plot twists. In Douglas Fairbanks' version from 1922, Robin Hood is the Earl of Huntington, going off on Crusade with King Richard (played by Wallace Berry).  Huntington returns to oppose Prince John, who is threatening to take the throne from his brother.     Errol Flynn's version has Robin Hood staying in England as a Saxon nobleman opposing Prince John for the same reasons as Douglas Fairbanks' Huntington.  Kevin Costner keeps the Third Crusade in the story but adds a Muslim warrior played by Morgan Freeman.  There are many approaches to telling the story of Robin Hood.     Ridley Scott's version is perhaps the most ambitious.  The film begins with Richard the Lion Heart's siege of the Castle Chaulus Chabral in Normandy.  This is where we meet Robin Longstride, a skilled archer, who has followed King Richard into battle for many years.  The king looks for an honest man and is confronted with Longstride who has been running a game of chance and is accused (by Little John) of cheating.  Robin is not cheating but, ironically, his honest answers to the king land him and his companions shackled.  So much for honesty and kings.     The death of King Richard allows Robin and his companions to escape and flee back home.  Along the way, they run across a party led by Robert Loxley retuning the crown back to England.   Loxley has been attacked by an English nobleman named Godfrey (magnificently played by Mark Strong) who is conspiring with King Philip of France to invade England.  Loxley is mortally wounded but Robin and his companions rout Godfrey and his men.  The dying Loxley asks Robin to return his sword to his father.  Not being a nobleman, Robin impersonates Loxley and returns the crown to the hands to Prince John.     The story develops with Robin and his men going to Nottingham where Robin is, conveniently, asked by Sir Walter Loxley (Max von Sydow) to pretend to be his son in order to preserve the household for his daughter-in-law Marion (Cate Blanchett).  The story centers on stopping Godfry and the intended invasion of England by King Philip.  A sub-plot concerns the rights of Englishmen centered on a documents of rights that Robin's father (long ago executed) was instrumental in conceiving. The document is the Magna Carta in all but name.     This Robin Hood brings the 12th century to life in all of its grim realities of hard work and, by our standards, hard living.  The production design is beautifully conceived, down to the rushes strewn on the floor of the manor house.  The performances are magnificent down to supporting roles. It was nice to see Mark Addy (of The Full Monty) as Friar Tuck and Oscar Isaac made an effective quarrelsome King John.  John Hurt has a strong role as William Marshall, a courtier of King Richard, and Eileen Atkins made a strong Queen Eleanor.  Danny Huston made an exciting Richard the Lion Heart.     The film ends with Robin declared an outlaw for supporting the rights of Englishmen.  The film ends where Errol Flynn's version begins.  I have not heard if Ridley Scott intends to take up the story but we are left in anticipation of what is to come.  This Robin Hood is well acted and beautifully photographed. The story is refreshingly different from the other Robin Hood's but it is a story that has differed from film to film and television.

B002JVWR9U|5.0|When I first saw previews of this show I was afraid that it was going to be a cheesy teen vampire show without real substance, but I decided to give it a try anyway.  Needless to say, after the first couple of episodes I was hooked.  Even though the show is targeted toward young adults I found the acting and situations to be intriguing and entertaining with sometimes more mature subject matter. I started reading the books after watching the first few shows, but the TV series is BY FAR superior. I think that the casting was flawless...especially Ian Somerhalder as Damon Salvatore. And although I loved Twilight, I actually have enjoyed this series much more.  Can't wait for season two to begin!
B002JVWR4A|5.0|At the beginning of the fifth season of the wildly popular forensic drama \\"Bones,\\" many viewers tuned in trepidatiously after the spectacularly strange fourth season finale. Thankfully, all fears were allayed and relieved when the fifth season kicked into high gear in the very first episode and maintained that pace throughout the season; \\"Bones\\"' fifth season is perhaps its greatest yet.<br /><br />The one thing that has always set \\"Bones\\" apart from the countless other procedurals on the airwaves right now is the focus on the characters solving the crimes rather than the crimes themselves, and the strength of this approach shines through brilliantly in every episode of this season.<br /><br />David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel return to the roles of Booth and Bones and deliver their strongest performances yet as each character is shaken to their core. As Booth struggles to regain his sense of self, he has to confront the knowledge of his feelings for his partner, while Bones herself goes through a whirlwind of emotion as the emotional barriers she has erected around her heart begin to crumble down, leaving her questioning not only herself but her relationship with Booth as well as her work at the Jeffersonian itself. The tension between the two has never been more delicious or more addictive, and both lead actors knock their roles absolutely out of the park.<br /><br />But while the relationship between Booth and Brennan becomes increasingly more complex, the wonderful supporting cast of engaging characters at the Jeffersonian keep the show moving along briskly and lightly. Cam (Tamara Taylor) must run the lab while dealing with the challenge of being a good mother, guiding the team effectively toward each conclusion; Sweets (John Francis Daley) continues to provide invaluable insight into the minds of the team; Angela (Michaela Conlin) remains the emotional heart and soul of the team as she opens her heart to love's possibilities; and Hodgins (TJ Thyne) struggles with his feelings for Angela as he returns to his abrasive, loveable self.<br /><br />The cases themselves have regained a fascinating light as the mysteries the team confronts become more complex, and the special effects department has outdone themselves in the gore and goop department this year as Booth and Bones investigate some of the most gruesome crime scenes in history, all moved along by the brisk black humor the show excels at; the team investigates a possible secret agent locked in a truck for days, a would-be rocker torn to pieces by an industrial washer/dryer, a gamer literally melted in a vat of fast-food grease, and a dozen more cheerfully disgusting cases where the outcomes of the mysteries hold the power to shock and surprise the audience; the writers have once again caught the perfect balance between the whodunnit and the drama to craft a truly unique show.<br /><br />But it's not merely the cases that hold the viewers' attention this season; season five is full of true powerhouse episodes: heartbreaking cases like \\"The Plain in the Prodigy\\"; darkly comical shows like \\"The Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\\"; truly shocking mysteries like \\"The Proof in the Pudding,\\"; and even a historically fascinating case written by the author of the original Temperance Brennan novels Kathy Reichs herself (\\"The Witch in the Wardrobe\\") -- however, all of these merely lead up to the three knockout moments of the season:<br /><br />In the fifth season, \\"Bones\\" reaches its 100th episode, \\"The Parts in the Sum of the Whole.\\" Likely the most beloved and most contested episode in the show's history, the 100th episode completely redefined Booth and Brennan's relationship as it showed the viewers the pair's first meeting, something never before revealed, and circles around to one of the most hearbreaking and yet most powerfully hopeful moments of the series. \\"Parts\\" was also directed by David Boreanaz, one of the series' leads, and the sheer emotion wrung out of Boreanaz and Deschanel by the end speaks volumes to the talent of the show's leads.<br /><br />As the series continues, however, the characters were shocked to their cores as they were forced to come face-to-face with their most terrifying adversary yet: the cunningly frightening sociopath dubbed The Gravedigger, in \\"The Boy with the Answer,\\" a nail-bitingly tense hour of television that had viewers' hearts pounding as Heather Taffet, the Gravedigger, proved that her true arena was the courtroom, tearing apart her victims and throwing the entire future of Brennan's life into question.<br /><br />This only segues into the season's amazingly dramatic finale, \\"The Beginning in the End.\\" As the team investigates the home of a hoarder, Bones questions what she truly wants to do with her life, Booth's past comes calling, and Angela's father blows back into town, all leading to a truly shocking season ender, a masterful finale that not only redefined the very foundations of the show and the characters but also contined to set the show on a rising point, ensuring that every faithful viewer of \\"Bones\\" will be frantically waiting for the sixth season to premiere in the fall.<br /><br />In the past five years, \\"Bones\\" has redefined the procedural while producing a truly unique show filled with drama, comedy and the most satisfying romantic tension between two characters in years. Featuring challenging cases, intriguing mysteries, gruesome discoveries, fascinating character interactions, and truly touching and shocking turns in the lives of a cast of characters an increasingly growing fanbase have come to know and genuinely care about, \\"Bones\\" has proven that it still has plenty of tricks to show, and this wonderfully strong drama will remain on television for seasons to come.<br /><br />Five out of five stars.<br /><br />NOTE: The fifth season also features the return of Max (Ryan O'Neil), Brennan's father, as well as a memorable cameo by Zooey Deschanel (Emily's real-life sister) as Brennan's zany cousin, as well as a truly touching show introducing Booth's grandfather, as well as the return of Jared Booth (Brendan Fehr), Seeley's younger brother, who has some news of his own.<br /><br />Also, it is important to note that in the fifth season, the writers managed to fix a truly annoying plot device: the revolving interns, who alternated between odd and downright annoying throughout the fourth season, have now managed to find a balance and a home on the show, with each character's unique traits adding to the episode they are featured in, providing some much-needed comic relief as well as some unexpected drama along the way.ent of the show's leads.

0385523386|5.0|This was a great book! Harrowing and terrifying and in the end life-changing, that's for sure. I shared Piper's terror upon entering the prison, and suffered with the degradation, humiliation, tedium, and lonleiness for those long months. The lesson was valuable-we are all responsible for our own actions, and blaming anyone else does nothing for yourself or the world.  But perhaps the most troubling thing is the prison system itself and the number of people incarcerated for drug charges.  We have a lot of work today to treat our fellow man with caring and respect. WOW! What a book! Thanks for writing. But we need an epilogue! Please!
B000001EAQ|4.0|A lot of U2 fans seem to dismiss this album as one of the band's weaker efforts, but I really get a lot of significant enjoyment out of it.  Although it is often branded as \\"techno\\" I don't really see this as a techno record at all.  Yes, there are some elements here, but this is still U2 albeit with a somewhat different sound to them.  Commercially this album did not do nearly as well as most of the band's other releases, but to my ears it is full of solid tunes.  Highlights include \\"Discotheque\\", \\"Mofo\\", \\"Last Night On Earth\\", \\"Staring At The Sun\\", \\"Playboy Mansion\\" and \\"Wake Up Deadman\\".  The only real weak track on the disc is \\"Miami\\" and even that one has grown on me over time.  Although panned by many I enjoy this album as much as most of the U2 I own and think it has been sadly overlooked by some of the faithful.
B0015XHP4K|4.0|I have this soft spot for Rambo movies - except for the last one, that one was a piece of crap.  But the first 2 were great action flicks, specially in light of the times they reflect. some cheesy lines along the way, but the action is awesome...Blue-Ray, thank you...
B000VLE3GA|5.0|The CD was in exactly the condition promised (100% perfect) and was delivered well within the specified time.<br />So for me this is precisely what i was hoping for and what i received. Many Thanx. Mike A. Gauteng, RSA.
B002ZG98VE|5.0|I thought this was a very entertaining movie.  It had a little bit of everything in it.  Action, romance, comedy.  I will be looking forward to the next time I can watch it.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|This is an album that really clicks with me.  It's one of those cd's I can turn to when I'm not really sure what I want to listen to, which is because of the talent that was used to create this music.  There's not a song I skip over every time.  \\"Perfect Day\\" and \\"American Honey\\" are perfect songs on a nice, sunny day, and they'll put you in a good mood on the gloomier days.  \\"Hello World\\" is almost like a piece of musical art; the lyrics are picturesque, the harmonies are beautiful, and the instrumentation draws me into the song every time I listen to.  \\"When You Got a Good Thing\\" is also a wonderful ballad.  This is a song that represents the beauty of marriage.  I find \\"Something 'Bout a Woman\\" a very fun song, and lots of people in America have grown to love \\"Need You Now\\".    And if you like singing, this album is great to sing along and harmonize with because the trio does that so well in the songs.  I would definitely recommend Lady Antebellum's \\"Need You Now\\" album.
044656740X|5.0|\\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" has taught me invaluable lessons in financial aptitude, and how to master money. After reading this book, I no longer have a fear of what will happen should I not have wages--because I am no longer a slave to money! I am finally out of the rat race of going to work for little money, then having to pay the government my hard-earned money through taxes, as well as paying off other debt, etc. It was an endless cycle. Now, instead of working for money--I am making money work for me! If you want to know the secret--read the book! As a clue, I will leave you with the words of the great Napoleon Hill--\\"Think and Grow Rich!\\"
B0036B8MZU|5.0|ive never seen such greatness in series making. see it from the beginning and savor the conclusion. dont let anybody spoil it for you. it will make you grab a sword, it will make you do push-ups, it will unleash your adrelanine, it will bring the warrior out of you. if you loved gladiator, 300, braveheart,last samurai, this is a must see, and once it comes out on dvd or blu (a must have).nudity,orgies,gore galore, more nudity, more gore, drama, sentimentalism, excellent soundtrack, more & more nudity, some more heads chopped off, then you have spartacus. i will own this the first day it comes out on blu. at this moment i just cant wait for season 2, i want it right now!!!!!! i sleep, eat, and sh#%  season 2. my props starz for bringing such a jewel of entertainment to us men. finally a series that understands us!  ;)
B002KSPKRS|5.0|great sound,  flexibility and completely wireless gives the surround sound effect that you would want from a set like this, cant complain at all and for the discount you get here at amazon its well worth the money and the receiver acts as a conduit for all sorts of things to to connected ie... my zunehd, ps3 surround sound system all in surround sound and all works very well an absolute great wireless headset
B0006Z2LP6|5.0|This is a great movie with Toms Hanks as Jim Lovell in Apollo 13. The movie according to Jim Lovell is very true to the events of that April in 1970. I was 16 years old at the time and remember the suspense of weather they would make it back to earth with their crippled spacecraft. This is a Ron Howard movie, so you know it's good! The weightless scenes in the movie were filmed in NASA'S training airplane, so they are very realistic. If you are like me and want to know what \\"gimble lock\\" is, do a google search like I did. It's in the movie but never explained to you. If you really want to enjoy this movie I suggest you read the book by Jim Lovell entitled \\"Lost Moon\\", or also titled \\"Apollo 13\\", same book with two different titles. It will fill in the gaps of the movie, and really amaze you just what these three astronauts endured on the journey home to earth.  The book also gives a brief explanation of what gimble lock is.... bad thing to happen in spacecraft. The book is available at Amazon.com.
B00003CX9E|3.0|I wasn't terribly impressed with this movie.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say that it's a little on the boring side.  The story premise is good, and Welles is a captivating actor, in my opinion, but on a scene by scene basis, the movie never really grabbed me.  There's a shallowness to it, a depth lacking from the characters...  although maybe that was the point?  Jorge Luis Borges wrote a very interesting review of this film in 1941, which when I look at it in that way re-interests me a bit, although ultimately it sounds like he comes to the same conclusion I do.  Here's the web address where you can read that review: [...]    But the movie is definitely worth watching, not only because it's sort of required watching for any film fan in the way that Moby Dick, however hard it is to get through the chapters on Cetology, is required reading (justly or not) for any American who considers themselves literate, but also because there is a truly epic, and highly intriguing story that is the film itself.  Welles and Hearst are great characters in themselves, fuller, more complicated and more absurd than any character in the film, and all of the hoopla surrounding the film and those characters as well as others (like Welles' \\"co\\"-screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz)are definitely worth looking into.  In fact there are two very good films all about it, [[ASIN:B0000507OD The Battle Over Citizen Kane]] and [[ASIN:0783116764 RKO 281 - The Battle Over Citizen Kane]] a nonfiction and fiction account, respectively.  So the film Citizen Kane serves as starting point for one of America's great stories, and for that reason I recommend it.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Thank god lately there has been a trend for the best comedy shows to have no laugh track. 30 Rock is a shining example<br /><br />It would be so, so great if Fawlty Towers would be remastered to make the laugh track optional. I've heard that some other shows have been released this way.
0061703257|5.0|\\"Shutter Island\\" follows two US Marshals tasked with finding an escaped patient at a mental hospital for the criminally insane on an island. She left the cell in the night seemingly into thin air. As the Marshals investigate further they realise they're not being told the truth by anyone on the island; the doctors, the orderlies, the nurses are all lying to them. Then they discover messages left by the patient which leads them to discover the true nature of the island and its' inhabitants.<br /><br />The novel is told at a blistering pace. The plot develops quickly, the twists come out of nowhere and it's a genuinely thrilling read. Lehane has an amazing grasp of atmosphere filling this book in spades. From the damp cells to the eerie staff quarters inside the odd fort to the mysterious lighthouse, there's so much here that's perfectly placed that it kept me reading much longer and quicker than I thought I would whenever I picked it up.<br /><br />There are a few people who don't like the ending but who reads a novel for the last 20-30 pages? It's a 325 page book - enjoy the journey! And I liked the ending anyway. It was far-fetched but given the nature of the institution you have to say that it's at least plausible.<br /><br />\\"Shutter Island\\" is well written, imaginative (how many novels really have that quality?), it's genuinely interesting and I loved it. This was my first Dennis Lehane novel and I've already got others lined up ready and can't wait. Highly recommended.
0307454541|5.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo has been reviewed and been on best sellers' lists for quite some time.  The main character, Mikhail Blomkvist, has been put in a bad light following a conviction for lible and is offered a job by a wealthy industrialist to find out what happened to his brother's granddaughter, Harriet Vanger.  It is assumed she was murdered, but all that is known for sure is that she disappeared 36 years ago. There are, as you might expect, many twists and turns and many characters that are presented that are intriguing.  There are, at times, so many Vangers in this book that I had a hard time keeping them all straight.<br /><br />There really are three different plots: what happened to Harriet? Who dunnit? and Will he get him?  Not all of these plots are related.<br /><br />The characters are rich and enjoyable and the story intriguing.  The last two paragraphs left me saying \\"what?!!\\" I'll be getting the next book in this trilogy.<br />Simon Vance did a wonderful job with the reading and will look for more books that he has worked on in the future.

0439023483|5.0|THE HUNGER GAMES, by Suzanne Collins, was a fantastic and thrilling story of survival when all odds are against you. The world that Collins created in Panem was scary but completely possible. The government in the Capitol was corrupt but extremely powerful and willing to take out anyone who rebel against them.     The characters in this book were fantastic. Even the smaller roles, such as the other tributes, were a joy to read. I almost wanted to know more about these children before their untimely and unnecessary deaths. Katniss was an amazing choice as the POV. She was selfless and strong, and all she wanted was to support her family. But she ended up with the short end of the stick when she volunteered to take her sister's place in the Hunger Games. In the beginning, Katniss would do anything but conform to the rules of the Capitol, but she quickly learned that to survive in the Hunger Games she would need to put on a facade or she would not live. She did manage to stay true and honest to herself, which ended her in a precarious situation at the end.     The men in this book were so great. Gale, as Katniss' best friend and partner, was a strong and perfect gentleman and an obvious choice for Katniss. But Peeta, being thrust into the Hunger Games with Katniss, created another piece of the triangle that was equally tempting.    I was blown away by this book. The idea of the Hunger Games was inhumane and disturbing. The fact that this government went to such great lengths to punish the children of those who rebelled stirred powerful and hateful emotion in me while reading. I do appreciate the honesty and amazing creativity that Collins put into this book, and I cannot wait to continue this series.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|Let me preface this by saying I've been or had been a fan of Metallica since I was first introduced in the '80's - I wasn't even 10 years old yet. I had an older brother that, thankfully showed me some good metal music. Metallica was one such band. Their 80's releases were so solid (I ignore the song One due to the great guitar work on the rest of that release). Then that fateful day so many dispute. August 13th, 1991. I remember driving to the store at the mall waiting for the gates to open at the record store, getting in and grabbing the first copy to fly off their shelves, taking it home and playing it at headbanging volume... what? Where are the palm muted triplets? Where's James trademark aggression... who told him he could 'sing'? It was... Bob Rock, that bastard pulled the balls right off Metallica and stole our band from us. Sure, the self titled album won the band accolades and millions of new fans but something was missing, it was Flemming Rasmussen at the helm of production (he had been there up to the ST release) many people may not realize the importance of a producer that can bring out the best in the band. I don't feel Bob Rock did that for Metallica. He brought something out of them, just not the edge or grit that some of the fans (myself included) yearned for. I listened to the 'Black Album' as my friends and I started to call it, looking for songs I could get into, bang my then long hair to... they weren't there. I ended up selling off my Metallica stuff for about 40 bucks to a friends cousin who was just getting into them. I was done.   I happened to catch 'Some Kind of Monster' not too long ago. Watching it I had sadly realized what Bob Rock had done to the band and maybe, what they had done to themselves. But, after a while of watching this I had thought to myself they should get Rick Rubin to produce them... then after getting done watching it I went and previewed the songs from St.Anger... nope.   Then I checked out Death Magnetic and saw thatit was produced by Rick Rubin.. WHAT?! So I previewed the tracks again, they were growing on me and I had wrote Metallica OFF. After reading some questionable comments on the MP3 quality I went to my local used CD store and found a copy for a steal. Dropped it in the CD player and hit the road. What was this, nod worthy riffage? Less singing and more aggro? I'll admit I haven't gone over the lyrics line by line yet (I'm nervous). But I have to say RR brought out what has been missing for the last decade.     Metallica    On a techie side, do the drums seem slightly loud in the mix or is that just me? Honestly I'm happy to say that I can listen to this end to end with little skipping or FF over. I'm sorry I can't listen to 'Unforgiven' anything...     Let's hope when the band and Rick come together again in 2011 we get something of equal or better quality.
0307120007|5.0|This is a great book for the infant/toddler set:  both fun and educational.  I was weaned on it and then had the pleasure to read it to my younger siblings, who wanted to me to read to them over and over again.  Simple but enchanting.
B000FBJAOG|4.0|\\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" is a very enjoyable satire that will be enjoyed by most Zombie aficionados. Max Brooks (the son of Mel Brooks) has written this rather serious toned guide to preparing for the Zombie Apocalypse that we all know is coming. The humor of the book isn't the \\"laugh out loud\\" type, but rather in the absurdity of the work as whole, so if that isn't what you want you might be happier with [[ASIN:0984067809 Zombocalypse Now]] (which I also enjoyed).<br /><br />The zombies covered in this guide are the truly dead, that is the [[ASIN:B00000K3TO Night of the Living Dead]] shuffler type that can only be stopped by a head shot, not the messed up living human type like found in [[ASIN:B00005JMA8 28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B002WY65VU Zombieland]] that can be taken out like any other human. This is an important distinction as it makes a big difference in your choice of weapons for your zombie fighting arsenal. So, with that distinction made, adjust your expectations (and strategies) accordingly.<br /><br />Max takes us through the cause of the zombie condition, rates the risk classifications by breakout type, suggests strategies, and presents equipment lists to deal with all of the various threat levels. There is also a section on the history of zombie outbreaks as derived from archeological evidence through more modern accounts, which was enjoyable but I found to be the weakest chapter.<br /><br />Keeping in mind that this is an elaborate work of satire, there are some factual errors that might cause purists to take offense (like a reference to \\"Nanook of the North\\" dying of starvation when it was actually likely Tuberculosis) and the effectiveness and use of certain weapons against zombies.<br /><br />Overall, this is clever work that provides an amusing insight into the strategies needed to survive the coming Zombie Apocalypse.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B002UZCJ8Y|3.0|It could have been a gripping thriller! The plot is original and interesting to me. In the movie, anybody could create a handsome and rich replicant of himself in the on-line world. The replicants can interact with each other like dating, etc. The original idea to me is that one day, a killer started killing the owners of these clones via the rerplicants themselves! However,  the directing and the action are just average.    It's worth watching once.
0066620996|5.0|Lana Vilmain  PHR, M Ed  Human Resource Generalist, Employee Development  lvilmain@aol.com    I highly recommend this book and plan to read others by the same author.     The research team spent over five years compiling the research. Some of the research goes back 100 years; while a couple of the examples are not current it all has an empirical basis. The author made a point toward the end of the book that I found very interesting. Essentially, the book's findings indicated that it was more important to find an employee that matched an organization's core values and purpose than necessarily a skill set. A company should get the right employees in the door and then find the position where they're most suited at that time. Then, the employee would be acclimated to the company and prepared for the next suitable move within the organization.

B002CAWNEM|1.0|Ok I've just finished watching this, and generally I make smart movie choices. This time I listened to the advice of a female friend. Call me sexist but that's the last time I'll ever listen to a woman.<br /><br />This is the most annoying, in fact literally painful film I've seen since... hmmm ever really. There's a 'successful' guy with a wife and a small kid who gets hit on by a new temp worker. In fact she sets out to conquer him from his wife. We have no idea why, I mean the guy is happily married, has money, a boring job as some finance manager, and looks ok, but that shouldn't be enough to be singled out like that. Anyway, the stalker is just so unattractive that viewers would find it hard to consider her a genuine threat to the marriage.<br /><br />Except of course the wife is almost as unattractive. She gets hysterical, with no attempt to understand what's going on. Beyonce seems to have just needed a role where she could be angry. Maybe she is angry in real life, take it easy girl, move out to the country, real life isn't lived in LA.<br /><br />I sort of enjoyed the final catfight between the two jealous princesses, though I didn't really care who won. Not that it was ever in doubt. This movie was such a straight line of clich&eacute;s and predictability that it's the only one I know that I would warmly recommend to deaf (or even blind) people, they wouldn't miss a beat.
B002Y5FKUE|5.0|I attended the HD live presentation of \\"La Sonnambula\\" at my local theater. It was only the second opera I had seen and it made me realize that opera can be really fun and some of the stories, such as \\"La Sonnambula\\", are easy to follow. Natalie Dessay was amazing as a singer and so cute to watch. She and Juan Diego Florez were wonderful together. I highly recommend this DVD, even for those who are new to opera.
B00337KM2S|1.0|I watched this tripe while flying on a sixteen hour flight to los angeles. fortunately, there were many other movies to choose from and i didn't have to pay 'extra' for it.     this movie was obviously hollywood's attempt to deal with the current unemployment situation in the US. it fails miserably simply because it goes nowhere. the notion of looking at the problem through the eyes of an impartial third party (hired 'fire' contractors) is absurd.     we are to show sympathy for someone who makes a living at firing people, who has to travel thousands of lonely miles, stay in cheap hotels and deals with airport security issues. we hear the stories of the unemployed, but it's the 'firing' contractor who must deal with their emotional ups and downs. it's the contractor who must quietly accept the fact that he is employed, when others are not.     i am not falling for it and neither should you. one star for frequent flier mile card scene.
B002UNMW7O|3.0|I'm wary of sequels because, in most cases, they are inferior to the original. This film was no exception.  Maybe it was because I went in with low expectations but I didn't think it totally stunk.  I had fun watching the McManus boys do their thing but the plot was lame and it ran too long by about 30 minutes.  Clearly, a third installment is in the works.  Hopefully, they won't repeat the same mistakes.
B003BKF696|5.0|In an age of one-hit wonders, media hype and comical sell-outs, The National continue to separate themselves as one of the best bands in America. What I enjoy most about this band is they make albums that engross and captivate you like very few other groups/artists today. High Violet delivers in every shape and form that I could have ever hoped. From start to finish it takes you on a journey, how one defines the journey is something each listener will have to determine for themselves as the lyrics can be interpreted in a million different ways. This is a mature, smart, intelligent and thoughtful album that should be recognized as one of the stellar works of 2010. If you're new to the National, give it a chance, listen to Boxer and High Violet like you'd read two books by an author and I think you'll quickly appreciate the brilliance of this band.
0810988232|4.0|Brian & Wendy Froud provide a beautiful oracle set with The Heart Of Faerie and I personally found the book to be well written and useful.I have to admit I really liked Macbeth's work on the first set but Wendy Froud does a great job here and shouldn't be discounted for it. My cards however were in really poor shape the first time around (nicked corners , no cellophane , warped and scuffed)sooo I sent them back and the next set was in \\"better\\" shape but still no cellophane. Great production but piss poor manufacturing. Come on Frouds lets pick it up for the next product!

B001DJ7PR8|1.0|First of all let me state that I'm a hardcore Woody fan.  Secondly,I totally agree with reviewer Ken Douglas.What was the little fellow thinking?  Is this the same guy who gave us ANNIE HALL,MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY,MANHATTAN,LOVE AND DEATH and even his ANYTHING ELSE (A GREAT FILM COMPARED TO THIS ONE)???  I can't believe I wasted my time and my eyes watching this piece of junk.  SIMPLY PUT (PARDON MY STRAIGHTFORWARDNESS):PURE GARBAGE!  Don't even bother renting this flop.  One star goes to the two female actresses since it wasn't their fault to work around a  horrible script.  Furthermore,Javier Bardem has to be one of the ugliest and worst fiascos that spanish  cinema has ever produced.If he can speak english I'm Richard Gere.
B00001OH7V|5.0|\\"Heroes\\" is the second album of David Bowie's \\"Berlin Trilogy\\".  It was recorded in July and August of 1977 in a West Berlin studio 500 yards from the Berlin Wall, and released in October 1977.  The album's sound reflects Bowie's appreciation of German electronica pioneers Neu! and Kraftwerk, with each band recognized in a respective song title.  Bowie and Brian Eno collaborated on most songs, with Bowie writing all of the lyrics.  The album has an upbeat, rollicking start with \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" and \\"Joe the Lion\\".  The triumphant title track is perhaps Bowie's most acclaimed song, and this album version is longer and even better than the familiar single version.  The slower \\"Sons of the Silent Age\\" and \\"Black Out\\" follow.  The upbeat \\"V-2 Schneider\\" opens Side Two of the original LP.  Three mostly quiet, ambient instrumentals follow: \\"Sense of Doubt\\", \\"Moss Garden\\" and \\"Neukoln\\".  \\"The Secret Life of Arabia\\" is the lighthearted closer, for which guitarist Carlos Alomar shares in songwriting credit.
B002UZCJ8Y|3.0|\\"Surrogates\\" is an action movie taking place in a world where there is no action.  Not any real action anyway.  Everyone in the world is allowed to sit in their homes and their replica robot is a doing all the real living.  Granted you feel what the robot feels, and you control the robot.  All of this from the comfort of your home.  You literally never have to leave the house, EVER.  You can also choose your robot to look like anyone or anything.  You can be a hot smoking blonde girl, even if you are an old fat perverted dude.  Now how is that for a plot?<br /><br />Can you imagine making out with a gorgeous girl robot only to find out she was really a dude in drag.  Damn, that sounds like every night in San Francisco.  Not that there is anything wrong with that.  Wait a minute, the only thing wrong with that scenario is some bad guys recently came up with a weapon that can kill your robot, and as your robot lays smoldering in a pile of burnt out electric circuits it somehow fries the operator's brain as well.  So much for going sky diving and not caring if your parachute opens or not.<br /><br />So Bruce Willis (the FBI Agent) begins the process of tracking down this freaky person that want to kill off real people and begin society's trek back to a crime infested pool of wrong doers.  In the process he loses his surrogate and has to meander out of the house for the first time in God only knows how many years.  It reminds me of getting the mail after lying around in my underwear writing all day.  There are several plot twists and turns as you jump from assuming it is one bad guy to the next, but it really isn't that hard to figure out the overall direction the movie is going.<br /><br />Bruce Willis plays his tried and true gritty cop character, and as always he pulls it off very well.  I wonder sometimes if he lives in Idaho walking around scaring the crap out of people.  The theme of the movie was a little eerie.  With the introduction of facebook, myspace and the myriad of social networks it seems our friends are becoming faceless characters on a computer screen.  We are well on our way  to becoming couch potatoes, with surrogates just being the next step in evolution.  I am now beginning to think it might be interesting to venture out of the house a little more often, once in a while.<br /><br />It wasn't my favorite Bruce Willis movie, but I did enjoy it more than enough to happily pay the $5.99 on demand fee while I sat at home, hung over, watching it.  The next time I see a movie I might actually venture out to the theater and who knows, maybe even have dinner in a restaurant.  I feel like I am getting a little pale from the lack of sunlight.ks it seems our friends are becoming faceless characters on a computer screen.

B00005K9LN|5.0|Judas Priest are metal gods, they forever changed rock/metal music and for the better, they are an incredible band that continues touring and recording music even today. After the complex brand of rock'n'roll Judas Priest was doing during the 70's there seemed like they couldn't expend much further on this sound and therefore the band decided to go a simpler way with the arrival of the 1980's. There's no problem with the sound of British Steel at all, sure it's less complex than \\"Stained Class\\" for example and I must say that the blues elements are gone as well but it's still Judas Priest. The fact that Priest simplified their music doesn't mean they didn't have any creativity or great music left in them, as it turns out British Steel is one of the albums that really defined metal, is considered one the band's best albums and when the band is mentioned it is often for BS .<br /><br />British Steel has them all: heavy songs (Rapid Fire), classics (Metal Gods, Living After Midnight) pop-metal anthems (Breaking The Law) and radio staples (United). Honestly there is not a single bad song on this album, no fillers it's all good (even if some are better than others). The singles are excellent Priest but the rest of the album is equally as great if not more impressive. The 2001 edition remasters series of Judas Priest albums features extra songs and this one is no different, it only has two of them \\"Grinder (live)\\" from the Defender of the Faith tour and \\"Red White And Blue\\" from the Turbo sessions. The unfortunate thing is that those two songs aren't from the era of BS, there is nothing extra from the album's sessions or even the tour supporting the album but two extra songs is two extra songs so I'll take them.<br /><br />Although this is not my favorite Priest album I'm going to have to go with the majority and rate British Steel 5 stars, it really deserves it. It was my introduction to Judas Priest and I'm sure it was for many other fans. Classic album, greats songs, great musicianship and I could go on. If this is not in your rock/metal collection then let me tell you that there is a huge hole in your collection! It's an essential classic.p and I could go on. If this is not in your rock/metal collection then let me tell you that there is a huge hole in your collection! It's an essential classic.

044656740X|1.0|I picked up a copy of \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" on a recommendation.  I'm about half-way through and struggling to finish.  The writing is so full of sentence fragments, repetition, poor phrasing, and cliche that I wonder how the author ever made it through middle school, let alone college.  Take pages 59 and 61 (of the hardback edition) for instance:    Page 59:  \\"In fact, if you really want to be confused, look up the words 'asset' and 'liability' in the dictionary.  I know the definition may sound good to a trained accountant, but for the average person it makes no sense.\\"    Page 61:  \\"If you want a lesson in confusion, simply look up the words 'asset' and 'liability' in the dictionary.  Now it may make sense to trained accountants, but to the average person, it may as well be written in Mandarin.\\"    Did he even proofread his manuscript before submitting it?    The content is as disappointing as the writing.  The author's point thus far is that by resisting dependence on a paycheck, one stimulates his imagination to acquire outside sources of income.  You can only attain wealth when your income from sources outside your paycheck is equal or greater to your expenses.  That's fine as far as it goes, but I'm a bit non-plussed that he took nearly half the book to say it.      He also stresses the importance of financial intelligence, and mentions in conjunction that it is unwise to run up credit card debt and increase your expenditures when your paycheck increases, but those points are fairly self-evident.      The author's negative views toward education bother me as well.  He seems to believe that people view formal education only as a means to get a high-paying job, and that since education does not always succeed in guaranteeing that high income, it doesn't have as much value as, say, focusing study on the way money works.  Although a college degree is often necessary to procure a high-paying job, the point of going to college is to learn.  Without a knowledge of history and literature, we wouldn't know who we were or where we came from or how to avoid the mistakes and repeat the triumphs of the past.  Without a knowledge of science and mathematics, we wouldn't understand (as much as we can understand) the natural world and universe around us.  Without the study of foreign countries and languages, we would never learn about cultures and ideas outside our own.  Relegating college to a resume-builder is insulting and shows a lack of appreciation for knowledge outside of the financial world.    I'll finish \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" to satisfy the person who recommended it, but I do hope the second half is better than the first.  So far, reading it has been an utter waste of time.
B00275EGX8|1.0|I don't think I'm being unreasonable in expecting a war movie to aim for epic, not a dainty, benign slice-of-life. It's worth noting that (in stark contrast to Private Ryan), many soldiers find this movie unrelatable, and in many cases, slightly offensive. Its tone, and unwillingness to go far beyond \\"Army Wives\\" style sentiment (\\"War is dangerous and hard. Some soldiers like violence\\"), is put to shame by anyone who has viewed the 2007 wikileaks video.<br /><br />Were it not for the Academy's desire to put a stick to Cameron's eye, and Voltage Pictures' subsequent decision to sue thousands of Americans for viewing this movie, the Hurt Locker would quickly reach its sell-by date and rarely be mentioned again.

B002VPE1AW|1.0|The only thing amazing about Avatar is the obscene amount of money involved in its production, media hype and resulting sales for what you would imagine a schizophrenic would experience having a stroke in a fish aquarium.  Also amazing is my overwhelming shame for having sat through most of it, and the impression of having been mentally and visually violated afterward.     The plot is stupid. It is beyond stupid. It is insultingly stupid.  There is nothing subtle about it (or anything else in the film, for that matter), and it is as if it were written like background noise for what is amounts to a a grand-Mal seizure of special effects (I will get to that soon).    The plot is so asinine it is almost amusing, but it is not. It uses every single overdone cliche and crams it into what might end up being one of the most intellectually vapid story lines of all time. The evil humans are after a valuable mineral called \\"unobtanium\\" (Yes...that is actually what it is called.) and the only thing standing in their way is a special effects crew on massive amounts of LSD, and obviously black people, who have turned blue, grown tails and interact with the local wildlife by mounting the enraged beasts back, wrestling with it and then shoving a tubular part of their body containing a cluster of nerves forcefully into the animal. I understand it is the future, but I know that sort of behavior is generally frowned upon and can lead to some serious prison time.     The \\"natives\\" are stereotypically black mixed in with some American Indian.  Their accents are Jamaican, they wear loincloths and actually chuck spears. Yes, they chuck spears and the humans (all white) call them blue monkeys. I am almost shocked at how blatant it was. When I say almost, it is clear that the dialogue and plot were conceived and written in approximately 20 minutes, probably during a particularly painful bowel movement. A lot of money could have been saved had they just put the actors in blackface, handed them spears and made them worship watermelons.    I would also like to just throw out the weird Marines vrs Navy thing going on. The blue monkey people are called Na'Vi and symbolically sodomize animals and are thin and effeminate, while the marines are stupid and insane and have superior firepower. Maybe this was unintentional, however with a dad who was navy and a brother who was marines it seemed pretty obvious. Maybe Cameron was army?  And this is the last thing I will say about the plot.  (I won't \\"spoil\\" it...I mean if this is your first movie ever and you have never read anything more complicated than street sign you might be in for a treat.)   I watched this with my mom and her husband (they had already seen it). I went home around 20-30 minutes before it was over, even though my mother protested that it was almost over and the ending had a decent twist. On the way home I called my mother from my car and told her that I wanted to guess what happened. I summed up the ending and got every single detail correct except for the fate of one uninteresting character who was no longer relevant after the first part of the film.   Yes, you read that right. I did not watch the end of Avatar and I still knew exactly how it ended.    And now I am going to complain about the special effects. This will not take long. I have a theory. The technology used to take the acting out of live-action film was reminiscent of old CGI technology. Jurassic Park still looks better than the blue monkeys in Avatar. While the body movements were slightly more natural, even that detail was completely swallowed up by the amount of camera shake and computer animation that made the whole film. In fact, just the absolutely ridiculous amount of special effects in every single frame struck me as though Cameron was desperate to draw attention away from his own megalomaniac egos premature-ejacula.... it also made me wish I had brought a barf bag. While it had many beautiful scenes, they were so overdone and busy, the camera angles so unnatural and the panning and shake so fast, the only way to adapt without becoming dizzy and sick is to find the stationary point on the screen and stare at it. And the novelty of absolutely everything on the planet glowing, floating and sparkling wore off really fast. The only useful application I could see for this movie would be to fast-forward it and give neurologists a cheap way to detect epilepsy.     So the movie was awful, the plot was embarrassing and the only special effect I got from watching it was nausea. The worst thing about it is that for all the ungodly amounts of money that were dumped into that movie to make it special and fantastic, it was about as much fun as being beaten to death with glow sticks.  I chose to drive home at night and was scooping poo out of a cat box by the time my mom had finished Avatar.
B0011NVC9I|1.0|Tell me, how do stupid people get to make major motion pictures?<br /><br />Ugly to look at, stupid to listen to, and pointless to follow--this has little to do with the great epic (other than sharing a title).<br /><br />It is my belief that the dopey director and stultifying cast decided to make this since the original epic was out of copyright and, lacking any ideas or originality, they seized on the opportunity to TRY to read it and understand it.<br />Alas, they failed.<br /><br />Save your money; save your time.  Watch an old Popeye cartoon, instead.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|I purchased this on a friend's recommendation, but I wish I had read more of the reviews first. An earlier reviewer described this as P&P as written by Charlotte Bronte and that about sums it up. Austen's sly social commentary and witty observations on human nature have been replaced by atmospheric shots of rain-drenched, fog-filled gloom and wavering shadows in candle-lit rooms. Elizabeth comes across as shrewish and broody, with none of the vivacity and quick wit of the original. Darcy seems dull and socially backward instead of a man restrained by his own rigid view of propriety and his place in the social caste. The secondary cast get only one or two pertinent lines from the novel to establish their character and motives, which reduces the circumstances that drive the plot to a one-dimensional Cliff Notes version of P&P.
B002UZCJ8Y|1.0|The idea that in the future we'd all interact with the world through idealized robotic versions of ourselves while our actual bodies grew flabby, decrepit and housebound is like something out of Philip K. Dick, a seemingly no-miss setup that would allow for both kicky science fiction adventure and philosophical jabs at the nature of identity.  Unfortunately, \\"Surrogates\\" does neither, settling instead for a generic chase movie with barn-sized plot twists.  It opens with a ham-fisted, explication-heavy montage, so it doesn't even do like some killer-premise movies and give you a great first twenty minutes before the story kicks in.  Instead there are explosions, unconvincing political tangents, and clumsy attempts at character development.  The climatic scene involves a showdown in a high-tech lair where the hero has to press a blinking Cancel button at the very last second, just like in [[ASIN:B0007YXREA \\"Team America: World Police\\"]].  It's a crime that a brilliant idea got turned into such formulaic dreck.  Someone should make this movie over again from scratch and do it right.

1423113381|5.0|This is the first book I've read by Rick Riordan and I loved it.  The combination of suspense, history, and mythology is just brilliant.  I'm going to have to read the Olympian series next.  I'm a big fan of young adult fiction because kids are a tough audience.  They won't slog through a book like an adult will just because they bought it, and so I believe that young adult novels have to be more exciting.  Riordan does not disappoint.<br /><br />I read in Riordan's bio that he taught English and history.  And now, through his books, he's teaching it again, only in a way that makes kids want to learn it.  For any parent who wants their child to enjoy two subjects that are normally near the bottom of their list as far as what they have to learn, Riordan breathes new life these subjects.  It's too bad that schools haven't caught on to this wonderful way of learning.  We might have more engaged students.<br /><br />I can't wait to see what other subject Riordan decides to tackle after the Red Pyramid series.  Whatever it is, I'm sure it's going to be exciting and informative.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1608605809 When I Dream]]

B002ZG983M|5.0|The title of my review says it all. I'm not offended by foul language or the comic-style over-the-top violence in the film - if those things bother you, then don't go see this movie. Chloe Moretz gives a fantastic performance as the blood thirsty Hit Girl, whose presence elevates the film from \\"pretty ok\\" to \\"un-freaking-believably awesome.\\" The violence, while intense, is rather bloodless and surreal; less realistic than another over-the-top movie favorite Crank. I've seen the movie three times and enjoyed it. The sound track is awesome too, although I don't know where the Elvis song was played during the movie.<br /><br />Compared with the comic from which it arose, it is light hearted and the supposedly main protagonist Dave Lizewski (Kick-Ass) played by Aaron Johnson fares much better - he is only tortured a little ;-) and gets the hot girl in the end (not literally - get your mind out of the gutter).<br /><br />Everyone in my family - including a 23yr old college student (male), a 17 yr old high school junior (also male), my wife (cannot disclose age under penalty of Bad Things Happening), and 14 year old daughter, and myself - all agree. Kick Ass kicks ass.
B000TUXL2A|5.0|Mark finally reaches the next level of professionalism. The guitar is not as prominent as on his other releases, yet it is woven into the pattern of music and played with (typical) perfection. More of ensemble work indeed, but the guitar still leads, creates harmony and transitions. The whole album feels as one complete piece, alike to say a piano concerto rather than a book of songs. I do not think I listened to any of Mark's albums as much, not even to his Dire Straits opuses.
B001C4AFOY|4.0|To be perfectly honest about it, I take no interest in the British Royal Family. None whatsoever. So, when my wife came home with a DVD entitled \\"The Young Victoria\\"  and said it was about British royalty I winced a bit and emitted a light groan.<br /><br />OK, she watches my movies and I'll try to enjoy her selections. It took a long time (at least half the movie) to win me over. I think what finally did it was the lush and lavish settings and costumes. Really elegant! My goodness, the buildings and grounds are totally overwhelming! Did people really live like that? But alas, all those servants and people waiting on you for your every whim and all the swirl of activity would tend to drive me nuts.<br /><br />In any case, in the midst of all this luxury and activity, not to mention the intrigue, we have this young girl becoming a long-reigning queen and finding a partner in Prince Albert. I've never understood how someone could choose your mate for you and plan it all out and then have it billed as one of the greatest love stories of all time. But, here we have it and it really did appear to work and the movie drifted into becoming quite an engaging story. The acting was quite good, even though it was of the stiff upper lip British tradition, and the elegance of the whole thing was just overpowering. It really was a fairy tale with real people and was quite an interesting historical piece as well. OK, it was an excellent movie, but it took too long to win me over.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

B000005AYM|5.0|Neo-soul wouldn't have been the same without Erykah Badu's 1997 debut Baduizm. The Dallas native's mixture of 30's jazz (her phrasing is reminiscent of Billie Holiday's), 70's soul (Chaka Khan in particular), and 90's hip-hop along with her colorful headwraps and earth mother persona set her apart from the other artists of the day.

0312330537|5.0|Shantaram is a truely great novel. It's not perfect - but nothing in this life is right? This book will take you to places you haven't been before - guaranteed. Roberts is a gifted writer despite being fairly egotistical and frequently reminding the reader he is an \\"artist\\", \\"intellectual\\", and a \\"philosopher\\" at the same time a super hard man that nobody but nobody messes with!     What I found interesting was that people who normally live a life like Roberts do not have the ability to write about it as Roberts does. Therefore for me, apart from being an amazing romantic roller coaster ride, it also showed me the inside of an underworld I could never have know about in any other way.     By the way, I notice some people here have said things like \\"a rambling 935 pages\\". I think that people who do not see much beauty around them, the emotionally defunct or people with not much going on upstairs would probably find this book \\"rambling\\"     But for all others I would say it's a MUST read. Even if you don't agree with what Roberts says sometimes - you can't deny the book for being truly original and wonderfully entertaining.
B000Q6GX5Y|3.0|This movie was very well done as far as the CGI and the green screening goes.  but I had to give is a three star simply because of the shallow story line and the unnecessary graphic sex which didn't add anything to the story it just gave us guys another thing to watch.  But like I said, the graphics are amazing and the epic war sequences are untouchable, just be ready for graphic violence and carnage throughout.   I guess if I had to sum up this movie in one word, it would be \\"Graphic\\".  Not that thats a bad thing, just be ready for it and you may want to see it before you have a family movie night with it.  Hope this helps!

B0029LHW68|5.0|I love this CD. I fact I like every song on it. That is why I bought it.
0307454541|4.0|This is a very interesting book, although it takes quite a bit of<br />time to ramp up and an equal amount of time to ramp down.  The<br />middle of the book is where all the fun lies.  There are two<br />protagonists in the book --- Michael Blomkvist and Lisbeth<br />Salander.  Michael is a journalist fighting to keep his name clear of<br />accusations and Lisbeth is the unlikely partner who helps him do so.<br />The first quarter of the book is devoted to Michael, with Lisbeth's<br />introduction playing a small part.  We find out that she is a ward of<br />the state, she is very smart (both street smart and book-smart), an<br />exceptional cracker who it seems can siphon off data from any laptop<br />at a moment's notice and uses encryption programs like PGP as if they<br />were child's play.  She is also a recluse and somewhat of a neurotic<br />personality who trusts only one man --- the gentleman hired by the<br />state to look after her interests.  Alas, he dies and is replaced by another<br />one with much less morals.  The manner by which Lisabeth neutralizes<br />the new gentleman is, ummm, shall we just say interesting.  In due course,<br />she hooks up with Michael Blomkvist and together they solve a 50-year<br />old serial killing spree, and in the process, clear Michael's name<br />and ensure that the magazine Michael founded continues to survive.<br /><br />So far, so good.  Now the nits.  I think the author takes some little,<br />but jarring, liberties with the reader's attention.  Two examples:<br />it seems highly unlikely that Lisabeth's boss would leave his office<br />unguarded for her to tool around in it at will (the author establishes<br />the bonafides of Dragan Armansky, Lisabeth's boss who runs the detective<br />agency where she is employed, in no less than 3-4 pages.)  Given the<br />rather impressive accomplishments of Mr. Armansky, it is not in character<br />for him to leave his office devoid of any counter-measures to detect<br />unwanted snooping.  Second, after Lisabeth and Michael escape from the<br />killer's lair, Lisabeth makes a great show of wiping her and Michael's<br />fingerprints off from the furniture and other paraphernalia they may<br />have touched.  What she did not do was to wipe away all the DNA<br />evidence in form of blood, hair, and mucus that had piled up.  Surely<br />someone as smart as Lisabeth should know the ramifications of a DNA<br />strand?<br /><br />In summary, it was an enjoyable book despite minor flaws.  I have been<br />to Stockholm once, so it was fun to see the familiar station and street<br />names.  This is the first in a series of three novels that the author<br />wrote shortly before his demise.

1572815108|4.0|This is a beautiful deck to look at, with inspired imagery painted by a noblewoman. However; her direction comes from a notorious figure in the industry, and it appears that the interpretation of many of the minor arcana suffer from this direction. In any given spread, a predominant negative cast intervenes within a spread which comes out very positive in other decks. For historical interest and the art, alone, it is worth the price. I would do a second reading with a more neutral or positive deck to check on the accuracy of any reading.
B002ZG98VE|4.0|No, it's not as good a story (or movie) as Gladiator, but there's a lot more Crowe on horseback in this flick.  The man can ride, and that gives this film an authenticity you don't see everyday.  I'm going to go back to the cinema to see it once more on the big screen, and then buy it as soon as it comes out.  It will sit proudly alongside my copy of Gladiator.  More details? The supporting cast was terrific, the story is a bit hard to take on face value, but Robin Hood (the legend) has a fairy tale quality about it that isn't ignored here.  There's a bit of grand standing with slo-mos during the big battle at the end, but who cares!  These are exciting battles!  Good versus evil (with apologies to the French) -  on horseback!!!  I loved this movie.
B002WIDRM6|3.0|Odered cd's and was promised delivery by a certain date. Never arrived. Contacted Amazon which they immediately shipped a replacement order overnight. CD's in perfect condtion when received. Didn't like the delay but Amazon always makes is right.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Steve's synopsis below is right on the money.  This should be obvious by the second viewing.  Perhaps now we can put discussions of the plot to rest and just enjoy what in my opinion is one of the top five movies of all time.
B00371QQ2U|2.0|I have nothing more to add about the movie itself, it's one of my favorites.<br /><br />I have to say this is the most annoying Blu-Ray implementation I have run into.  With my Sony BDP-N460 plugged in to the internet, takes forever to load and shows pointless trailers.  Then it returns to the Blu-Ray player's home menu, so I can't watch the movie.<br /><br />Walk over, unplug the internet connection, and bingo, it plays.  Universal - great way to ruin a great movie.  If this is what BD-Live is all about, forget it.<br /><br />What you *could* have done with BD-Live is created some great interactive pages about the apollo misssions, links to NASA photos from the mission, etc...<br /><br />That being said, the picture is an improvement over the upscaled DVD, and the audio is worth it.

B0010X73ZG|4.0|I like this movie, but I love the ending. I really wasn't ready for that. Thomas Jane does such an excellent job. I've been a big fan of Darabont since The Shawshank Redemption, and he doesn't disappoint. The effects are a bit weak at times, but overall, this is really good.

B00005JLWN|5.0|Exciting, well-written movie with Christian Bale starring as the lead. He gives a strong performance, anchoring everything on his shoulders. The story is familiar but still original. I loved the gunplay. My only complaint is this DVD release sucks. No deleted scenes or behind the scenes except for a ridiculously short promo piece.
B002WTC93S|5.0|This novel moves so quickly and easily that I found myself unable to put it down.  I am not usually a fan of detective novels but this is so intriguing with its World War II involvement.  An excellent read.

I have my own business and am looking at acquiring another.  Maybe, I enjoyed the book, because it goes against many of the concepts of business school.  Examples:  Just get started, everyone thinks of a thousand ideas in the shower, it take courage, guts and determination to act on an idea.

B002ONC9NC|3.0|I just saw An Education last night after waiting until it came onto DVD and Oscar hype had subsided.  I enjoyed it and thought that it was pretty solid for the first 95% of the movie.  However, I can't give an unqualified recommendation.  Here are my general impressions:    (i) Acting   Carey Mulligan needs to go over to Sandra Bullock's place to retrieve her Oscar. The travesty of Bullock's win for The Blind Side over Ms. Mulligan's subtle and sad, yet vivacious and spirited performance has made me question my conception of the universe - There is simply no conceivable way that a just and loving God could allow such an outrage to his creation.  Mulligan is an absolute star, transitioning throughout the film from an obedient but questioning schoolgirl to a rebellious adventurer to a devastated young woman.  I believed every step and found myself throughout thinking \\"Yes, that is how a young woman in that situation would act.\\"  Her internal conflict between pain, stubborn pride, naivety, ambition, and rebellion are just wrenching.  I will say it now: Carey Mulligan is the finest actress of her generation, bar none.     Peter Sarsgaard was great, as usual.  I spoke with my mother after we both independently watched this movie.  She said that, based on his character in An Education, she would never be able to watch another film with him again.  His character was just so despicable that she could never again see him on screen without reawakening her disgust and loathing.  I wouldn't go as far as that, but thought it spoke volumes about the power of his performance.      There are other noteworthy performances:  Olivia Williams, Alfred Molina, and (an effective, but underutilized) Emma Thompson.  Finally, here is a sentence that won't be repeated soon: Rosamund Pike (the bad guy from Die Another Day) was pretty darn good too.    (ii) Story and Script     The plot and the dialogue were both good.  I have to admit that Nick Hornsby generally drives me a little crazy.   Among other works, I read High Fidelity and saw About a Boy and my impression has always been that he tries too hard to be hip and quirky and spends a lot of time trying to convince his readers/audience how cool he is.  It's an affliction of many authors of his generation (I think the medical term is Brett Easton Ellis Syndrome) and it drives me absolutely batty.  Surprisingly, he did dial it back for the most part in this one and, notwithstanding an unfortunate monologue near the end by Mr. Molina, limited the ham-handedness of much of the script.      The big problem that I had with the movie was that the last ten minutes of the movie really compromises the first ninety.  I will give you a SPOILER WARNING right here, though if you know anything about the movie, nothing here should be too big a revelation.  The major theme of the movie is a clever, but sheltered young woman gets mixed up with an older man, who despite his surface sophistication, turns out to be not only a conman, but also much more sinister.  The progression of the story is how this girl is drawn step by step into his web while rejecting the premises that have driven her life up to their meeting.  The real narrative force of the movie is the battle between her beliefs in received values (i.e. ambition and independence) and her need to venture beyond the limits prescribed by her life, her family, and, indeed, by her society.  Her intellect heightens both sides of this conflict, justifying her ambitions while simultaneously amplifying the rebellion against them.  In the long run, her pride wins out to disastrous consequence, leaving her cheated of the fruits of either.  If the movie had ended there, it would have been a devastating, poignant story.   However, the actual end of the movie (actually really the last five to ten minutes), turns the whole conflict on its head.      (iii) The End  Instead of having paid the consequences for her choice, it turns out that, oh well, everything turns out peaches regardless.   It brought two thoughts to mind:    First, there is an episode of the show, \\"The Simpsons\\" where all the schoolchildren get stuck on an island and spend the episode trying to find a way to survive and form a society (yes, it was take-off of Lord of the Flies).  They struggle and fight and look for a way home to no avail.  Right as the show is ending with the children still stuck on the island, the narrator says, \\"Oh, yeah.... The children were rescued by, let's say, Moe\\".  The irony being that everything up to that point was pointless... Just wrap the thing up however.      Second, I have this visualization of some seedy Hollywood producer taking a look at an early cut and spitting out a profanity-laced tirade: \\"Don't you know chicks are going to see this and that chicks hate sad endings?   I don't want you coming back until you frou-frou up the ending, got it?  This is going to be my biggest hit since The Scarlet Letter.\\"*      The point being that any kind of emotional investment that you have in this character and this story (and for me it was good deal) is just undermined by this trite ending.  Why did it matter which road she took throughout the rest of the movie if they all led to the same place?  Why should a viewer care about the betrayal that was meticulously built throughout the rest of the movie if there are really no consequences anyway?  It just seemed lazy and pandering to me and made me sorry that I had taken the rest of the movie seriously.    Conclusion  Notwithstanding the three stars, I would recommend this movie if for nothing else for the acting.  However, I would warn against taking the plot too seriously; you will just be betrayed.      *As a personal note, I've never forgiven Gary Oldman for that one.

B002ZCDR88|3.0|I first heard of Natalie Merchant because my Dad went to high school with the drummer for 10,000 Maniacs. So I watched the MTV Unpluged video for 10,000 Maniacs and I was blown away. Now, 10 years later, I have bought Natalie Merchant's new album, \\"Leave Your Sleep,\\" which I think is more folk than it is rock. But it's pretty good. It's amazing how Merchant has evolved musically and mentally.
B000FVQLQQ|4.0|As a person living with mental illness, I would recommend the movie \\"A Beautiful Mind\\". The film was about a man's ascension in the mathematical community, descent into his own world of paranoid schizophrenia, and ultimate heroic accomplishments while accepting his symptoms and being able to disengage himself from his delusions and hallucinations. John Nash, the movies' main character, proves he is sophisticated as well as a brave man in his quest to overcome his symptoms of mental illness while struggling to make a name for himself among collegiate peers that were considered the elite of this country's great minds. This movie also demonstrated a historical perspective in respect to therapeutic measures of the past treatment of schizophrenia. The family structure demonstrated in the movie provided an accurate and sophisticated viewpoint of how families of the time period possessed ways and means for recovery. The role of the professional in regards to the psychiatrist provided insight into symptoms associated with schizophrenia in relation to educating both patient and their families. In conclusion, John Nash proved through his Beautiful Mind, that a person living with schizophrenia does not have to settle with the struggles of daily hallucinations and proved that he could achieve amongst the highest nobility of men.

B000TGCR38|5.0|I purchased the Black Book at a discount counter in a local video store.  Oh! I was presently surprised when I viewed it.  The movie is filled with intrigue, double dealings, surprised friendships, characters who one would suspect to be evil actually turn out to be honorable and individuals who one expect to be good are less than honorable.  The language is in Dutch with English subtitles.<br /><br />The Film Starts and ends on a Kibbutz near the Dead Sea in 1956.  A friend Ronnie(Halina Leijn) is a tourist visiting Israel with her Canadian husband who Ronnie met during the liberation.  It is amzing how allegiances change.  A few hours earlier Ronnie was servicing German members of the Gestapo.  Ronnie provided support for Rachel Stein alias Ellis de Vries, as a spy and a Jewish woman.  Seeing Ronnie triggers powerful memories from our heroine Rachel Stein.  The scene immediately shifts to the autum of 1944 in German occupied Holland.<br /><br />Rachel Stein played by Carrie Van Hauten is being sheltered by a farm family in rural Holland.  The farm house is accidently bombed which sets off a series of events that involves a group, inside the Gestapo, that tricks wealthy Jews by offering them passage on a barge-like boat to liberated Belgium.  The passengers are murdered in cold blood and their money and personal possessions confiscated.  Rachel Stein's family is wiped out but Rachel miraculously escapes and soon links up with the Dutch underground.<br /><br />She cleverly avoids being caught on a train ride by ducking into the passenger compartment of the Gestapo, Hauptfuhrer Ludwig Muntze subperbly played by Sebastian Koch.  They immediately hit it off over their mutual interest in stamp collecting.  The Dutch underground take advantage of this infactuation to have Rachel Stein (alias Ellis de Vries)infiltrate the Gesapo headquarters.<br /><br />Ellis impresses the Germans with her singing (Rachel sang in Berlin before the Nazis came to power).  Rachel meets the individuals who were responsible for the murder of her parents and other wealthy Jews.  She fights her repulsions for these characters.  See the movie and find out who is honorable and dishonable.<br /><br />As a final note, this reviewer was impressed with Carrie Van Hauten portrayl of Rachel Stein.  Rachel's role is a complex one.  Carrie actually performed the entertaining scenes and performed them perfectly.  The casting for all the parts in the movie is excellent.nsible for the murder of her parents and other wealthy Jews.

193413712X|5.0|There are a number of things that make this winner of the 2010 Pulitzer for Fiction remarkable:<br /><br />* Harding's prose here is exquisite. His voice is consistent, despite his giving life to a number of primary characters: George Crosby, first introduced in the book and dying of Parkinson's. Then George's father, Howard, a daydreamer who suffered epileptic seizures. And finally Howard's father, John, a Sunday sermonizer, as Howard termed John's gift. Harding's shifts between these men and their voices comes in an array of technical devices, voices, and points of view.  One in particular stands out as John is introduced:<br /><br />\\"It had never occurred to Howard to tell George about his own father. Howard thought to himself, That's right; my own father was always in the room upstairs...\\"<br /><br />* For a relatively young man, Harding demonstrates an awful lot of insight into the human condition:<br /><br />\\"George Crosby remembered many things as he died, but in an order he could not control...To look at his life...was to witness a shifting mass, the tiles of a mosaic, spinning, swirling, reportraying...showing him a different self every time he tried to make an assessment.\\"<br /><br />* His use of clocks as a recurring metaphor for time - the greatest onus a person might bear in life - is perhaps more tightly drawn than Orhan Pamuk's similar device in The Museum Of Innocence.<br /><br />* There's little story here (not my favorite thing) - simply vignettes that tend to summarize , not only George's life, but that of his heritage.<br /><br />* The book is largely a complex narrative (well executed, but again, not my thing), devoid of dialogue. What is offered as dialogue here is not put in quotes (another not-my-thing), which tends to subordinate the characters' various voices to that of the book's narrator. Taking this device on is a bit dangerous; one risks making the characters monochromatic and placing the narrator too obviously between text and reader. But Harding has a deft hand - he knows how to wring drops of voice from the scantiest dialogue bits without losing the narrative's consistency.<br /><br />* Harding's story is emotional - not by plot and character happenstance, but by tone and mood, by never surrendering the dignity of his characters to their many foibles. This is mastery of narrative, of the prose phenomenon we know as the novel.<br /><br />By my asides, you can tell my admiration for Tinkers is grudging. Harding has an MFA from the Iowa Writers' Workshop (MFAs having never been my thing), and this book is a case study in what's taught in those venues, those aspect hovering loosely about what we clumsily term post-moderism. But, ultimately, what makes Tinkers remarkable is that its author has the superb good taste to know when to use his technical tools and the talent to make the best use of them.<br /><br />Why did Tinkers win the Pulitzer? My guess: The book is a meditation on life's many limitations, but limitations that are never caricatured, never treated with banality, limitations that are marbled with humor and wonder and affirmation.<br />This is a dense book, not easily experienced by the casual reader - it will be worth multiple readings to plumb its essence in totality.<br /><br />My rating: 4-1/2 of 5 starss of voice from the scantiest dialogue bits without losing the narrative's consistency.     * Harding's story is emotional - not by plot and character happenstance, but by tone and mood, by never surrendering the dignity of his characters to their many foibles.

B000024E9F|4.0|Not that there's anything wrong with music that can send you to sleep. This is pleasant, gentle, delicate sounding music. If you do fall asleep, the last couple of minutes of the final track could wake you up again, as it sounds positively heavy metal! Quieter than their superior debut, it's nonetheless a pleasant listen. As with their debut, there was, once again, a song which had lyrics that were daggy...in this album's case, that song is \\"White mountain\\". Some albums that I've heard in the last year or so do a similar line in storybook lyrics, but do it better. E.g. Cream's \\"Pressed rat and warthog\\" as well as Malcolm McLaren's punk origin story on \\"The great rock'n'roll swindle\\" album. Both 'songs' seem pitched at a younger audience than Genesis' song here, but they have a greater charm about them.      Best songs (on second listen):      Dusk - 4:13 minute long. A pleasant track with delicate vocals and string instruments. Both carry a nice melody. As with their first album, there is a touch of the Bee Gees to the backing vocals. Some exotic instrument features on this...a zither, at a guess? Has tinny bell clinks, an organ, and a flute. Lyrics touch on relgious themes, at times. Perhaps this song comes closest to having a commercial pop sensibility. With more refining of it, a pretty, hymnal, commercial sounding song could have been achieved. I love Mika's \\"Happy ending\\" single...it's a great recent example of how a pop song can have a haunting beauty to it.    The knife - 8:55. Has a rock intro with rock guitar and organ sound (think Deep Purple type sound). Lyrics are sort of heavy metal territory...some Metallica songs aren't too far away in spirit from this song. The last minute and a half or so sees heavy metal rhythms introduced, with heavy beats and strumming.      The rest:      Looking for someone - 7:06. Intro is bluesy and soulful, with the lead guitar notes on the electric guitar. Drumming is busy in a solid way, but interesting. A nice keyboard melody appears later. Flute makes an appearance.    White mountain - 6:45. Delicate dual acoustic guitar note picking. A boy's own type song...about a wolf, or sung as if he was the wolf. Again, these type of lyrics have been done by heavy metal band Metallica. Not being from England, I'll have to assume that my use of the word \\"naff\\" is apt for the lyrics in this song...talk of kings etc. Wind instruments in this song have a mediaeval flavour to them. Lead guitar intro brings to mind AC/DC's Angus Young, for his technique and sound in \\"Thunderstruck\\"...some nimble fretwork, in other words.     Visions of angels - 6:50. Genteel, piano notes, dual lead guitar notes, keyboard. Has a stronger sound at other times, with the drums for instance. Not sure if this song was written before or after Australian singer Helen Reddy won a Grammy award, but in any case, lead singer Peter Gabriel refers to God as \\"She\\"...like Reddy did, in her accepting speech...saying that \\"She made all things possible\\" or some such.    Stagnation - 8:50. Genteel, delicate track re vocals and guitar note picking. Has a pipe organ sound or some such to it...could be a synthesiser. Sounds more like a rock song later on.        Recommendations:        Genesis: From Genesis to Revelation    King Crimson: In the court of the Crimson King/In the wake of Poseidon    Cream: Wheels of fire/Disraeli gears
B003BKF696|5.0|The National's music is hard to pin down.  It might be harder after listening to High Violet.  It is another example of what happens when an ever-maturing, ever-productive group of musicians is allowed to experiment with sounds and develop.  Each song features a distinctive layering of lyrics, the sound of each instrument, and showcases the abilities of everyone in the group.  High Violet demonstrates The National's commitment to a consistent, evoloving style true to their muscial roots.  They are fast becoming the defining American band of a generation.    This is an album that requires repeated listenings.  Given time, each song reveals something you didn't quite hear earlier.  The final three songs--Conversation 16, England, and Vanderlyle Crybaby Geeks--demonstrates the full range of their creativity.  Oboes in unexpected places.  Sing-a-long choruses.  Optimism not found in earlier recordings.  Just a great album.
B000002HPT|4.0|This is an excellent release although even the band derides it for many reasons, not least among them the undue pressure exerted on them by the record label to release something \\"commercial\\" vetoing a composition that the band had  created as a sequel to Metropolis Part One. Also, the label recruited hit guru Desmond Child which  helped the band  to commercialize at least one hit that I know, called you not me. The solo was abridged and the title of the song changed (it was called \\"You Or Me\\").  Even with all these problems it is a magnificent record. But you'd expect that from the Dream Theater pack right?
B003MPH6EI|5.0|First Walt got into the drug trade in part because of his cancer and now Hank's recovery may have to be supported by Walt's illegal meth making because Hank's plan isn't good enough for him to make a full recovery.  Maybe this show's most scathing indictment is of the medical industry when a teacher and a government DEA agent don't have good enough coverage when one gets cancer and the other gets shot. That's where we are with this show and really, this far into it, I got to thinking about the state of the country.  It used to be only low lifes who couldn't even finish high school, like Jesse, got involved in drugs. Now it doesn't seem all the incredible that families of solid middle class citizens, who have walked the straight and narrow well into their forties, all college graduates, would get into it. People have been known to revolt after all and it usually does follow a period of vast injustices. Even though they don't all know it, we've now got 6 family members being supported by the drug trade and it seemed like the natural thing to do after episode's end.
B00151G0CK|5.0|This album is a fantastic collection of the best of The Darkness.  If you enjoy any of their songs give this cd a try.
B00005JNDZ|2.0|I gave this a 2 star, only because I have actually seen worse movies out there.  However, this movie was not really enjoyable at all whereas the first one was quite entertaining.  And since this sequel has all the same plot, characters, and jokes as the first--only now less interesting, less endearing, and less funny, respectively...I highly recommend you to re-watch Bridget Jone's Diary instead of this one.  Take my word for it, nothing new happens in essence, and any changes they made to pass this as a new movie are precisely what made it so bad.
0385341008|5.0|A pleasant surprise and heart-warming story about a slice of history that might have been lost to the average reader of World War II tales. I had never heard of this small island of Guernsey and its German occupation, and was pleased with the author's efforts to personalize that time in history. I was surprised that the \\"re-telling\\" f the story through letters worked so well, and would encourage readers to give it a little while to get into. Also, while I know that the war was harrowing...this story is not as graphic as others set in  WWII, like Shindler's List, The Pianist, Sarah's Key, or Those Who Save Us.
