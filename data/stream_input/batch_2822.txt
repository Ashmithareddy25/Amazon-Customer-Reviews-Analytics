B00127RAJY|5.0|First off, I'm a little biased, as I love Jillian Michaels' style. She's definitely nothing like the peppy traditional fitness gurus out there. Personally, I always hated the happy, smiling jerks telling me &#34;you can do it!&#34; while I sweated my butt off.<br /><br />That being said, this workout is pretty tough. I've been on level 1 for about 3 weeks - yes, you're supposed to move after 10 days if you're going to finish in 30, but level 1 is enough for me at this point.<br /><br />The best thing about this workout is the fact that its broken into 3 circuits. By the time I feel like I'm dying, I realize that I'm already almost done with circuit 2 and I only have one left - which helps tremendously.<br /><br />The one drawback is that the stretching segment at the end isn't as long or helpful as others I've done, but I don't mind doing my own stretching after the video.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|I love this game!!  I started off slow but now I'm great!  It's so fun and entertaining! I can't put it down!!  Five stars!!!!  :-)
B00AB7HESI|1.0|its all just for wasted money. b-day money down the drain.it wont load... it looks fun but it is actaully doesn't load.
0545265355|5.0|Shipped right away! Read them all in 2 weeks. Great books! I am extremely happy with the speed and quality. I recommend this book series to anyone interested in adventuruous page turners!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I read very few self-help books at this point in my life but this one was reccomended by a friend in the investment community. The ideas presented will remedy any depression if the person makes an effort to apply them.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Without coming across as cloying. I thoroughly enjoyed this story of teenage love and hope recommended to me by my granddaughter.<br /><br />The book was well-written and his portrayal of Hazel and Augustus believable, not an easy feat when dealing with teens.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend this book to readers of all ages.
B000X6VD1G|5.0|Antony's work is so beautiful and poignant.  It keeps gettin better the more I listen.  Not everyday Pop . A real Artist
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is amazing if you a fan of iron man than this is for you having choice between gyro and touch I recommend gyro I've only been to a few places but there are probably many more able to play multiplayer on Facebook and also much more Gameloft has filled gigabytes of  space how many games I got from them including Batman and Spider man
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think the area above about describes it. The game play is pretty quick and I like that it gives an age group option to determine the &#34;difficulty&#34; of the game.
1451696191|5.0|I read this books way before the movie came out and feel in love with it.  I've reread it a handful of times as well.  Everything about this books just makes me fall in love with it.  The ideas behind why Chbosky wrote what he wrote are amazing as well.  We all have secrets and its ok.  This will always be my favorite book.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Happy to have found this book. A decent coming-of-age storyline written in the style of a thriller, Outview kept me turning the pages until the end. Nate, the lead character has a great inner and outer journey, and it was exciting to share it with him! Five stars.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have loved this keyboard since it was in beta andit has grown so much and is an awesome keyboard, you might say the best keyboard available.
B00DIMXTBO|5.0|I recently finished the first in this series and so had to give this book a go.<br />We continue the journey with Nate in this thriller/sci-fi as he saves the lives of his friends and all those around him.<br />A fast-paced adventure and well worth the time to read.
0374533571|5.0|it's nice to know the story behind the movie - I loved the movie and thought I'd also love the book
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I can check on the weather for the all of the United States at any time and get it up to date
B00BLSJI80|5.0|Demi Lovato is amazing as always. Beautiful voice for a beautiful girl. I received my CD quickly and it was in great shape :)
B002ZG98C8|5.0|So bad yet so good! Funny and profound at the same time, wake up call on border relations in high camp.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|I first heard Royals from the radio and was immediately drawn to her music and voice. Then I researched more about her and heard her other songs. Each song is unique and hooked me up. Current favorite is Tennis Court. More power to this young woman! I'm a fan!
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|This film was better than I expected, Tom Cruise delivered a solid Tom Cruise performance.<br />Love Robert Duval in anything.<br />Bought this so I could see my car (owned a 70 Chevelle SS 454).
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book will give you a whole new appreciation for what the brave members of our military, specifically the SEALs go through, for our safety and our freedom. Thank you Marcus Luttrell.
0470913029|1.0|The book came all folded into itself and almost unreadable. Had to put it under 45 lb weight to try and flatten time out!
B004SEUJ82|5.0|There are movies we watch and there are movies we don't watch and then we have The Boy In The Striped Pajamas...<br /><br />This is a movie EVERYBODY should watch!<br /><br />Why, you say... sorry, I can't tell :)<br /><br />But one reason is: it's a brilliantly told story with a brilliant ending!<br /><br />And, whenever someone tells you something sounding completely unbelievable, think of this movie!<br /><br />What are you waiting for?<br /><br />Get it! Watch it!<br /><br />You'll never regret it!
B00AHXDECG|5.0|I'm an 80's baby who grew up on 90's music. I miss that era and the great music that it generated. I barely listen to anything new because I'm so disenchanted with the garbage we call music these days. But Bruno Mars is like a breath of fresh air with his raw talent, with truth and originality jumping out of every track. If you want something you can listen to through and through this album is it. It's a classic!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Phone dropped from hand on the 5th day I had it and my phone cracked! Not the case but the phone....no way worth the money!
B002R88G5E|5.0|Wonderful book - so moving. Incredibly well written. I always recommend it to others. The emotion created by the author is outstanding and the plot was excellent.
B00DVXVMT6|4.0|it is a really good album i really enjoy head banging to it. especially plastic wonderland! great song!!! i love it
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This app is such a great app so much fun it's a great app to pass time. Get this great app
B00C0QOZP8|4.0|corey taylor is one of my favorite singers! this album does not disappoint!! awesome album awesome band you cant go wrong with this album!!!
1452110581|5.0|Bought this as a gift for a cat lover.  Recipient was tickled and could identify with many of the poems!
B00E193TM2|5.0|they did a awesome job with the whole album including the remake of mama said knock you out w/ tech nine! great album!
B0064J6OMO|4.0|Jason Bateman pretty much makes this movie. He is usually cast as the uptight, more conservative guy, so to see him break out of that and say some exceptionally crass stuff is kind of hilarious. Ryan Reynolds was okay, too, but, still. Bateman is the real funny man here. Overall, it was a funny take on a been-there-done-that story.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This is a great addition to my Galaxy Note II. This is at the top f my list for photo apps. Only bug I have is some photos rotate 90 degrees from the original position, requiring an extra step of rotating them back where they belong.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|This latest Die Hard has some pretty cheesy dialogue, and the relationship between father and son is only slightly believable. But I still liked the action scenes and was able to enjoy the movie for what it was. In the end, Bruce Willis, you will always have my heart.
B00AIBZLVY|3.0|I spent more time laughing than I was in actual suspense. The movie was quick to start but the actual fear factor in it turned out to be more of a comedy. The graphics were okay and the main antagonist design was very ugly which made me laugh!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very addictive! Great fun for thinking folks. Highly recommend down loading this app. More fun then writing a twenty word minimum review.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|Wonderful game. This bundle is great for my collection and I more than likely will purchase another just for personal use.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am only about half way done with the final book but I love this series!! Very great story. I love the connection between the couple. It's more than just sex.
B000000WJK|5.0|Some of the finest music ever made. Coming from a Shoegaze perspective, I rank it right up there with Ride's Nowhere, Lush's Split and MBV's Loveless. But in many ways it's even better and more diverse than those cds. I just bought A Storm in Heaven a week ago, and with every listen I've been blown away by the quality and listenability of the entire album.
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|loved this game INTIALLY...even spent quite a bit of money upgrading...then one day it just wouldn't open...fails to launch game on my kindle fire...REPEATEDLY...very disapointing
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I like Baldacci  as an author. I have read several of his books and truly enjoy his style. A+ rating.
B005PK57IK|5.0|The Good Wife is so well written and portrayed. Every season is a work of art. Being able to fit humor in just right in a drama is not easy. This show pulls it off perfectly.
B00AAI7B7W|3.0|Every prime movie we see from Amazon, the audio goes on and off, Amazon &#34;claims&#34; its my TV, but then why is there no problems with Netflix, Hulu, etc???
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I have only had the game for like 5mins and I'm already on level 6 and I played the game all night super fun
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Good story line - not complicated or no surprises but an honest look at young boys' view of the world and the reality of unhealthy love
B001CDD84Y|3.0|Very good movie but a twist for a ending.  Good action and drama but the plot was average.  Needed more character in the plot
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is by far one of the best Stephen King books written.  It is not in the typical genre people expect, and I devoured it, really a good read!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Would have liked more closure for Pat like to have more if a glimpse into to Pat and Nikki's marriage, what happened after Pat beat up Phil, how Pat really broke down and ended up in the neuro facility.
B005COO1X6|2.0|Not what I expected and didn't really like the story at all, bought it for the name Stephen King and was very disappointed.
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis played an excellent role, that left such a huge impression of what life would have been for President Lincoln. It was beautifully directed by Steven Spielberg with an excellent cast.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|Great episodes and story lines with the characters and very suspenseful. Plot is very understandable and leads into the next episode.
B00CISAPJS|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. My son saw it in the movie theatre and immediately fell in love with it. When it finally came out on Amazon, we purchased it and he could not stop watching it. Great special effects that will leave the kids in awe.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|love this game,only downside is that u don't get a lit of coins or whatever is needed to start a new game. I also wish u can chat while playing other than those two things this is a great classic game with a few new school twists!
B0002F6AH0|5.0|This is a multichapter set, comprising some 26 chapters. You could begin watching this the first Saturday of January and continue right through May if you so chose. The presentation is entertaining though, so with the entire work at your disposal, you may choose to watch more than one.<br /><br />Sir Laurence Olivier's narration is excellent. I was actually fond of his reference to Henry V, a film of Shakespeare's play in which he appeared in 1944, and another I can highly recommend. The focus is primarily on the British effort, though the US and Russia are also treated. This is appropriate since it was first presented in 1973 and 1974 on ITV in Britain.<br /><br />This is a great asset to a personal library, or a library in a school or university. It would help to capture the attention of students even on a warm spring day in a large lecture hall.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Amazing and heart warming story perfect for middle schoolers I loved this book it's so great it made me cry its so great
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|The ability go vet rid of ads would make this. A five star but it plays as it should thanks everyone at uno
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I have an addiction to Uno. Thank you for making my addiction available to Kindle. I love that this app is true to original Uno.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|This game has very cool graphics that make the game fun to play. Especially because it looks just like the movie.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is fun, relaxing and easy to play. I have tried others and this one works great. Has good color back grounds, and card selections!!
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Matthew McConaughey is a great actor. Love all his movies. Need more movies with him in them. Location on river was wonderful.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game...it's awesome!!! I would suggest it for you ;D . It has a variety of different sharks to play with &amp; best of all ... it's very detailed :) . Trust me you WILL NOT regret buying it &amp; I only make reviews for great games like this one :D
B0096HL33G|5.0|I watched this on my Kindle when we had a rainy day (very unusual this summer).  The acting was superb and the clarity of the picture and sound on the Kindle were outstanding.  Loved the movie, am enjoying the Kindle Fire HD!
0062200909|3.0|opened it and found what looked like bloody fingerprints in side on some pages other than that book is in ok condition
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is really addicting i love it a lot keeps me entertained for his and it is great for kids on long drive.No Wi-Fi needed just download and enjoy it. It's free to its amazing. It's the best ever.
140006922X|5.0|Historical context is necessary to understand any movement regardless of its religious or political nature.  Rome dealt wit Jesus politically, not as a religious figure.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its the best game ever i think its easy simple and just like subway surfers i lov  the despicable actions an  missions that they give you it amazing try this game its really good
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I don't write reviews often, but this book I really enjoyed. It brought me back to when I was a kid/teenager watching these shows, movies and games. I really enjoyed remembering all the games I had long forgotten. I'll be interested to see what the author comes up with next. If you were a geek in the 80s/90s, you'll probably enjoy this book. It's an easy and fun read.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|All of the metal gear solid games in one collection for one low-price, this can't be beat. The downloadable portions are small and don't take up much room. This is a very fun game collection and I would recommend it to anyone who loves the series.
B000FA675C|1.0|I got this book on a promotion on Kindle free.  It wasn't worth that much.  The dialogue was horrible, the &#34;facts&#34; were ludicrous distortions and the characters made cardboard look three dimensional.  I am dumbfounded by how rich this utter dreck has made Dan Brown.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|really enjoyed interesting plot great graphics almost forgot it was Tom Cruise wife liked it too.  Recommended to my family and friends
B001XVD21Y|2.0|I have loved Scoraese's films. But this one moves from cliche to cliche, imitating other films. And perhaps most of all grounded in one unlikely coincidence after another. It does notvorovidw the expected Hollywood ending so be prepared to be shocked. But overall mediocre.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Does the trick particularly when installing apps (APKs) offline. Easy to use. I've already used it quite a bit. You'll find it a necessary tool.
B0089LOG02|5.0|To think this really happened made this book even more worthwhile.  I could easily relate to the characters, being a foster parent years ago.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|Well, when looking for an alternative to Google Play, I thought for sure that Amazon would have their head on straight and would allow you to choose where the downloaded music is stored so that the memory limited main phone storage, which cannot hold my music collection, would not be crunched.  Unfortunately, Amazon has it WRONG as well.  There is no setting to choose the download location, thus the poor ranking of this application.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I look forward to more levels to solve. I love exercising my mind on each of the different floors. what's next?
0307473708|5.0|Book Info: Genre: Thriller/Police Procedural<br />Reading Level: Adult<br />Recommended for: twisted people<br />Trigger Warnings: murder, torture<br /><br />My Thoughts: This is actually my second read-through of this book. I've been collecting this series since shortly after book three came out. I've also watched the first four seasons of the TV series, but to be honest, I much prefer the direction the books have taken. But I'm ahead of myself here...<br /><br />So, this book introduces us to Dexter Morgan and his world, where he balances a fine line between his work in the law-enforcement department in Miami and his \\"social\\" life as a serial killer. I've identified these as police procedurals because they share a lot of the same aspects, especially when we see the details of Dexter's work in the forensics department.<br /><br />I've been quite impressed with Lindsay's descriptive abilities right from the start. Things like:<br />\\"...the Need was very strong now, very careful cold coiled creeping crackly cocked and ready, very strong, very much ready now--and still it waited and watched and it made me wait and watch.\\"<br />As well as: \\"This night it would happen, had to happen. Just as it had happened before. Just as it would happen again, and again.\\"<br /><br />I also love some of the subtle dark humor, such as, \\"I enjoy my work; sorry if that bothers you.\\" and, \\"...the idea of sex is no idea at all. Imagine doing those things--How can you? Where's your sense of dignity?\\" as well as, \\"Every major city has a section like this one. If a piebald dwarf with advanced leprosy wants to have sex with a kangaroo and a teenage choir, he'll find his way here and get a room. When he's done he might take the whole gang next door for a cup of Cuban coffee and a medianoche sandwich. Nobody would care, as long as he tipped.\\"<br />I could probably go on for pages with quotes, but I don't want there to end up being spoilers. As it is, all these quotes have come from the first few chapters, and anyone who has seen the TV show will already know about these things.<br /><br />As one professional reviewer put it, Dexter Morgan is the first serial killer to unabashedly ask us for our love. Of course, he didn't remain the only, as a spate of follow-ons (including the excellent John Cleaver series by Dan Wells or the Jasper Dent series by Barry Lyga, the latter of which I have not yet read, but hope to someday) showed. But being the first is something special, and I'll always have a special place in my heart for this excellent first book in the Dexter Morgan series. Highly recommended for other twisted souls.<br /><br />Series Information: Dexter Morgan series<br />Book 1: Darkly Dreaming Dexter<br />Book 2: Dearly Devoted Dexter<br />Book 3: Dexter in the Dark<br />Book 4: Dexter by Design<br />Book 5: Dexter is Delicious<br />Book 6: Double Dexter<br />Book 7: Dexter's Final Cut<br /><br />Disclosure: I purchased this book for myself. All opinions are my own.<br /><br />Synopsis: Meet Dexter Morgan, a polite wolf in sheep's clothing. He's handsome and charming, but something in his past has made him abide by a different set of rules. He's a serial killer whose one golden rule makes him immensely likeable: he only kills bad people. And his job as a blood splatter expert for the Miami police department puts him in the perfect position to identify his victims. But when a series of brutal murders bearing a striking similarity to his own style start turning up, Dexter is caught between being flattered and being frightened--of himself or some other fiend.chapters, and anyone who has seen the TV show will already know about these things.<br /><br />As one professional reviewer put it, Dexter Morgan is the first serial killer to unabashedly ask us for our love.

B00C6Q3UNK|5.0|if you want a bonus doll [operetta] with no extra cost, go to walmart for the same price for one get two its only a walmart limited time only
B008Q0D32S|2.0|To us this was painfully slow.  We were tired and wanted something to watch and I guess we were just too tired to turn it off until it was over.  It is a movie from a different era where things were slower.
B0083ZRAJS|2.0|I have loved the Wizard of Oz movie since I was a kid and so I thought reading the book would be fun. How they put such a good movie together out of such a badly written story is amazing. I really couldn't even finish the book.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|While this tender movie begins with a humorous misunderstanding, the entire story is told by building your awareness of the importance of just what this young man is being taught.  The characters are believeable, true to the nature of each character, and all in all, the movie has much to teach us of the gentleness and respect we owe each other.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I did order on July 24th well before the promo cutoff of 5:30 PM EST on July 25.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/ref=pe_424060_31534320_pe_button/?docId=1001297671&ie=UTF8<br /><br />I still wish I didn't order at all.<br /><br />The device was not to ship for another week.<br /><br />It arrived. It is small, but not exactly what was expected.<br />It requires a usb cable to power it. But you never see the USB cable in any of the marketing for the device.<br />I guess I thought that the USB cable would be for charging purposes only - sort of like a cell phone. Not a requirement to always be plugged in.<br />But that was probably more my mistake and misunderstanding than the Chromecast.<br />There was no coupon for the Netflix trial. After scrounging around, I finally hit upon a website from chromecast that stated that the tril promotion would be emailed within one week of shipping.<br />Well, it didn't.<br />I tried the chromecast with an iPhone and iPad. Doesn't work. They are working on it. ???? Why advertise that it works from an iPad, when it doesn't?<br />I tried it with chrome. it was a worse experience than simply attaching an hdmi cable.<br />Why bother?<br /><br />The app support is in its infancy. The device support is in its infancy.<br />The promo or Netflix does not work.<br />The device is not worth the $35.00<br />Save your money and get a Roku or even an Apple TV.<br /><br />As for the Netflix promo, I finally called Amazon Customer service and they said that they would turn this over to marketing to get my code shipped within 1 day.<br />I then asked for a promotional credit instead for the $23.97 value that the Netflix promo was worth. After placing me on hold. The polite customer service representative placed a $30.00 credit on my Amazon account.<br /><br />The one star goes to the Chromecast. It is a piece of junk.<br /><br />I will give Amazon customer service 4 stars for turning around and honoring my request for a credit to myaccount instead of simply getting the Netflix promo coupon.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|What a wonderful story for Dustin Hoffman to give to us!  I've bought it, have watched it several times already, and I can only praise Mr. Hoffman for finding the story, for finding the perfect setting for the story, for casting a gorgeous cast, and for using the marvelous musicians in all their glory!  Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful...
B00CTESTA8|5.0|I Want Harvey! Besides That..This Show Is Awesome! The Writing Is Definitely Off The Charts, And The Acting Is Stellar!
0061730335|5.0|This was a fascinating read and is a great example of how human beings can overcome great obstacles to achieve a remarkable goal. It's a warm-hearted book that keeps you turning the pages keeps you rooting for William. I loved learning about Malawi and about the (recent) famine they experienced there. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in books about the amazing human spirit.
B004WCTLNY|5.0|I totally loved this movie.. although I do feel a lot more could have been done with it than what was, but that said. I feel it was still a great movie that gave you food for thought afterwards.
0143122916|5.0|This is one of those mind-blowing true stories that you can't help telling your friends about. This is a &#34;can't-put-it down&#34; type of story that is stranger than fiction. And most importantly, it's an extremely important topic about North Korean labor camps that illustrates perfectly the evil of the North Korean government. It's not propaganda, it's just fact--and really disturbing fact.
B000FBJF7I|5.0|I liked the style of writing which gave me the feeling of being in Botswana.  There were sub-plots in the story but the author kept them all connected.  Frequent reminders of who the characters were did not detract from the story instead it added to the charm and the importance of each character.  I was inspired by the simplicity of the selfless acts of giving displayed making the 'tears of the giraffe' quite apt.  This is the 3rd book by this author that I have read and will certainly be reading others.
B00DQT1EOI|5.0|Loving this book well worth every penny, very up to date and super implementable.<br /><br />I recommend books all the time but I almost feel like I wanna keep this little secret all to myself.
B008602KQI|5.0|This was the type of book that you wonder when it will be getting exciting. Well hold unto your  hat because I promise you won't be able to put the book down  when the game begins.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Very well acted and entertaining, loved the music and, laughed lots. All of the actors and actresses I really enjoy watching
B00ABLJ5NQ|3.0|As it is Neil Gaiman, I just wanted more, the story was finished before I felt satisfied by this typically curious world he has weaved. Strangely, if I had seen the book in a bookstore, I would not have bought it, as it felt like a short story. Also I bought it with a mind to read to my daughter, which it is not suitable for, but that is probably okay; Gaiman's wider corpus will draw her in in time.<br /><br />I was impressed by the skill in his storytelling, but the offering was an appetiser that left me wanting much more.
B0057UAE54|5.0|Frampton is and always be the greatest live album ever. This is a masterpiece that cannot be duplicated. buy it
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|great game to pass the time. those minions will definitely drive you up the wall so keep your cool and you should be good to go.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|A great book for any creative person that gets straight to the point so you can straight to being creative.

B003O86FMW|5.0|To see the film and start Mockingjay!! Always love to read the books and see the differences when the movies come out!
B009JZWO3I|4.0|Another excellent episode of The Good Wife. Sorry I missed it when aired, but good to know Amazon has available afterward so you don't have to be home every Sunday night and can catch at your own schedule.  More twists and turns at the firm this year than a corkscrew.  And a great setup at the end for the next episode.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|While the number of NDE stories, books have increased, Dr Alexander's is unique in the length of time he was in this state.  More importantly it is unique in the depth of scientific knowledge he brought to his experience and to his &#34; understanding&#34; of it after when he returned to this plane. A must read for anyone who ponders what lies beyond.
B008YRVW0I|3.0|This game keeps freezing on me. I had it on my p.c. a while ago and had no problems. But on my Kindle it freezes often which is very frustrating.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Once again Dan Brown takes just enough of the factual, yet mysterious, symbols, and partly secret organizations that we all know exist and cloaks them in the garb of the lingering, suspicion that there is an ultimate conspiracy in power in our world. As always he skillfully mixes history and current institutions which in some way are in all our lives with just enough surprising twist to make it a &#34; don't put down&#34; until the last page!
B00004CXT5|1.0|I did not realize it was a region 2 movie, I cant play it or do anything with it.  I will pay more attention in the future!!!
B001NHNG64|5.0|Non-stop action and numerous twists and turns make this a book you won't want to put down.  The attention to detail is amazing and paints a vivid picture all throughout the story.  A must read.
B000063JZQ|5.0|Truly a wonderful Macbeth....and my favorite.  I have seen other Macbeths and was not as impressed.<br />The costumes and the scenery were remarkable but mostly I think the movie was edited very well.<br />Many of the scence were surpring and delightful.  The fight scence at the end of the movie was unique<br />and captivating and suspensful...as most fight scenes as justa  rehash of all the others we have seen.
B001NZEHMS|5.0|Uh, hello! This is a must have to keep. They are the innovators and started it all. Three dudes with a vision. We miss our friend but their music will always be with me.
B006QVRVJK|2.0|Great plot but poorly executed...as far as the dialogue...the acting was great but I think the play is just too pedestrian<br />Expected more sophistication.
B009EAO38C|5.0|Totally play this all the time. I love the remake of Somewhere Over The Rainbow. An album worth having. I always have these guys keep me company at work.
B0002O7XVI|5.0|Beautifully filmed and costumed. Very well acted and well edited so that everything is explained but still leaves enough for the viewer to come to their own conclusions. Highly recommend this movie.
B00881VLCE|4.0|fun way to waste time. would recommend for a car ride or long times of boredom. love the puzzles and the different lecels
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I normally don't gush about games on reviews but seriously whoever can't like minions are heartless and have no soul or may possibly just be an all around un-fun person. Either way the Minion Rush game is hilarious to play and I love watching my 3 year old son zip through the game and making me look like a complete noob.<br /><br />Pick up the game. Love the game. Be the game.<br /><br />Ba-Nan-Naaaa!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Ordered for our Granddaughter. Lots of laughter and based on her reaction to the skill level, we are very much satisfied
B000JMKO3C|3.0|The characters and story were interesting, but the plot was predictable, and prose only good. The message was so thinly veiled it should be obvious to a middle schooler by the end of 50 pages.
B000W8HC8I|5.0|This was a perfect summer book. It was easy to read and entertaining. I would recommend putting it on your list.
B00C061I3K|4.0|Couldn't really avoid this album unless you wanted to admit that you missed the spring and early summer of 2013.  It's not 100% long term favorite tracks, but it generally stands up well.  I had to hold back on it for a while now due to overplay in the public sphere but I'm pretty sure by next year or so I'll have it in my moderately-frequent rotation.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Compelling in Season 1 but needs plot boost by the last season - more variety of outside challenges requiring warring partners to work together even if unwillingly.
B00BMTX5XM|4.0|&#34;If You Leave&#34; is truly outstanding for a first full-length album from a band.  When I first heard it I had to play it through and through, sometimes twice a day or more, and that is something that I almost never do with any album, new or otherwise.<br /><br />The only deficiency is that, somewhat normal for a relatively young and relatively recently formed band, the overall sound (and the musicians' playing styles and just their general affect) is similar enough from track to track that one might not need a full album of this material.  Yet I do like each song individually.  At least three, if not four, tracks are permanent additions to my portable player and long-term favorites list.<br /><br />I have recommended this album (with well received results) to friends for its depth of feeling and overall emotional impact.  It tells a story of a period in a young (though adult) person's life in a way that is quite enrapturing.  Bravo to Elena Tonra and her bandmates for having the audacity to go directly to this material rather than slowly working their way up to it over a much longer time as some bands might.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I read it for my book club and it is not my kind of book.  It was interesting and it made me think on the topic but I much prefer fiction.
B00009UTQD|4.0|In actual practice, I am just not likely to keep my filters inside of little cases of their own when using this bag.  I'm going to need to slide each filter in and out of its section with no other protection.  I do it carefully and I'm satisfied that between handling with care and the good coatings on high quality filters, I'm not putting much wear on them.  But it would be nice to see a softer lining in the sections than there is.  I don't know, maybe that would only hold any grit that got in there, which would be worse.
B008VBYN80|4.0|This game is awesome and could have been a 5 star but Game Loft has sooo many issues being able to keep the game playable :-( It has become more frustrating than fun, I had to give it up :-/
B004Q8LDL2|4.0|Good action movie, Sean Connery is great as usual.  However the movie does involve a number of Michael Bay-isms that may annoy some people, such as the hair stylist.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love it! This is a great thinking game. I play it with my grandmother and we both see things the other one doesn't. Keep creating more rooms.

B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this clock. I take my kindle everywhere so having this clock keeps me on track with appointments and perfect for travel.
B00DIJ49UW|5.0|First off, I love soundtracks and anything that sounds light giant metal robots (Transformer lover as well). I liked it as well because it had it's own unique sound to it that when I listen to it, or any other sibling of mine, they think &#34;Pacific Rim&#34; so kudos for this being so awesome and giving sound to the awesome movie!
B003XQ9BXU|5.0|Great job Russell Crowe... The whole movie was well made. I thought the volume of the conversations was too low and the background music too loud. Nevertheless, I am looking very much forward to the sequel!
B004SBULWE|4.0|Very helpful and easy to use. I'm still learning how to use my phone but having the advanced task killer on my phone is very helpful for me.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Extremely well written, with well-rounded characters who &#34;survived&#34; Book 1. Verifiably realistic events.  I can't wait to read Book 3.
B009AMANH4|5.0|My wife is a history buff, she has watched this film over and over, she just loves it, Daniel Day-Lewis was a great actor in the file.
B008S68O5G|5.0|Mike oldfield in an  unparalleled talent. His mix of musical style in an over all theme is just majic. Get it
B0039NK208|4.0|My Daughter was in Band Camp, rented it because she wanted to know what everyone was talking about. Do I need to say more?<br />Been years since I saw it, but it still maintained it's funny factor.
0385344333|5.0|I chose this rating because I enjoyed this book very much.  It was hard to put it down...Yes, I would and have recommended it to others.  I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys reading and anyone that loves a mystery....I am looking forward to his latest book due out in September.
B00E9PVFHE|5.0|Good plot-keeps you guessing through entire movie. Rachel McAdams is quite superb in her role. Noomi intriguing and plays her character to the hilt.
0385340559|5.0|I believe this is the 5th or 6th book by Lee Child I have read.  I have enjoyed each of them very much.  I was introduced to Lee Child by a friends husband...I have since recommended them to my daughter, sister and brother-in-law...So far only my daughter has commented on the author....Too bad, they don't know what they are missing.  Chuckle!  The absence of the use of &#34; the F word &#34; is sooooo refreshing....I also like books by Lisa Gardner & Nora Roberts but the use of the &#34; F word&#34; really turns me off.....
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I enjoy this game find myself playing it for hours and not knowing it. Plus who can't help but fall in love with the little yellow guys.
B009JBZH54|5.0|It's not like this really needs a rating, you already know what you're paying for, but this trilogy includes a hardcover artbook. If you're anything like me, this will seal the deal, but on the off chance that you're the type of person who doesn't enjoy production shots, concept artwork, or information about the filming process, then perhaps you'd best skip out on this and buy a DVD set or something. Either way, I got this item on sale for a great value, and the bonus artbook included only sweetened the deal.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging and fun!! I was so upset to find that there was only 10 levels! Left me wanting more! Please add new levels! Need to create a help guide too.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Kudos for high production value! The graphics were impeccable and the puzzles weren't too easy. A steal for the $2. I'll definitely buy more games from this company.
0920236251|5.0|One of the best books for very young girls.  Teaches them self confidence and goes away from the cliched &#34;damsel-in-distress&#34; theme.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|As I have not watched Jag-the Sixth Season yet, I can't comment on it. I will not be watching it for a while yet.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|I'm looking forward to trying this out. I really like how the author goes through and explains the benefits of fasting. Also inspires you because it's on your own schedule and terms. With this new diet you still get to enjoy your favorite foods. He does encourage for you to see your doctor if you have any health concerns.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|I truly enjoyed the movie. Loved to see the action film cast from the past. The movie was very predictable and still entertaining.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|That's how I feel, few hours after finishing the book. I just want more, I want to know more about... I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll keep my mouth shut and just say - I want to know more about EVERYTHING. I loved every aspect of this book. The characters, the world, the lore, the battles, the quiet moments, the mystery. I love how brutal and dark the book was, without shoving any excessive gore and tragedy in your face. Every drop of blood was there for a reason.<br />The pacing was impressive, there was no repetition, no dragging sections. The author did not shy on showing major events, he felt less important for the actual story, with just a brief description.<br />The story is entirely about Vaelin's adventure, there's no switching between characters every few pages, which I'm grateful for. The only exception, Verniers' POV at the beginning of every part, but these are also centered around the main character.<br /><br />I first thought this book was stand-alone, but it's not, it is part of a series. There is a bigger plot that goes beyond the current novel. Yet this one stands well on it's own, there was a certain closure to the story. So even if there are no more chapters (and, as you may guess, I hope there are more to come) you won't feel left in the cold.<br /><br />An epic fantasy adventure, light on magic and weird creatures, but with enough of these to spice the story. You should read it!
B000I8G5GW|4.0|The Bridge on the River Kwai deals with the ambiguous position in which Allied prisoners of the Japanese in Southeast Asia found themselves when ordered to help build a railroad from Bangkok to Rangoon that would supply the Japanese army in Burma as it prepared for an Allied counter-attack. The dilemma of Allied officers was heightened by the ignominious way the British Army had surrendered Singapore. The Japanese military code of bushido called on defeated officers to commit suicide rather than surrender hence they acted almost as though Allied officers were &#34;non-persons.&#34;<br />  The protagonist of the movie is the senior Allied officer (Alec Guinness) at a camp responsible for construction of a wooden bridge across a &#34;River Kwai,&#34; a fusion of two Thai rivers: the Khwae Noi, a &#34;rural&#34; river that runs alongside stretches of the Burma Railway, and Khwae Yai, an &#34;urban&#34; river that flows past the City of Kanchanaburi. Just north of Kanchanaburi stands until this day a steel bridge, re-erected by the Japanese in 1943, and repaired by them after an Allied bombing attack. During the re-erection process, rail traffic passed over a temporary wooden bridge that was later demolished: the source of the bridge in the movie.<br />  The construction of the railroad, including the bridges, by specialized Japanese army units is considered a great feat of engineering. Its completion greatly helped their war effort. The frequently cruel attitude of the Japanese engineers and their men towards the Allied prisoners mars their technical achievement.<br /><br />The author artfully limits the action to a rural camp to highlight the interaction between the Japanese and Allied officers. In this isolated environment, the British senior officer convinces himself that the morale of his men is better served by collaborating with the Japanese. As the Japanese, contrary to history, begin to flounder, the Allied officers even take over the project. The completion ofthe bridge on time---that is to say, in order to prove most useful to the Japanese army in resisting the Allied counter-attack---becomes a matter of pride for the Allied troops, especially for the senior officer. He ignores its military purpose and fantasizes that, in years to come, future generations of civilians will applaud the bridge as his greatest accomplishment.<br />  Taking advantage once again of the &#34;move&#34; to a rural setting, the author invents a commando team that will blow up the wooden bridge. The commandos have explosives in place the night before the bridge is to be inaugurated by the passage of an important convoy. As they await the arrival of the train to maximize the destructive impact, the senior Allied officer realizes the bridge has been mined and alerts the senior Japanese officer. In the resulting melee and shoot-out, the senior Allied officer eventually falls on the T-handle of the detonator and destroys &#34;his own&#34; bridge. Only at the last moment does he ask himself, &#34;What have I done?&#34; So, in the end, this is a moral tale about the sin of pride.

B004LROMWU|5.0|I was very happy to get the 1st season of Falling Skies.  Let me tell you I had to watch the whole season as it was so good.. I can't wait to start the 2nd season..  Yes I will tell all my friends about this TV series..
B004LROUW2|5.0|... a compelling call for autonomous thinking and reflection upon the world. One of the greatest books I've read in quite some time.

B004FOA84A|2.0|I wish I had read the reviews prior to purchasing this app.  It took me only about an hour to solve the entire puzzle and get to the end. I was flabbergasted that there was no more gameplay.  All I'm saying is if you are an avid puzzle fan avoid this app you will be disappointed.
B001QJUX24|5.0|I seen this movie so many times. It is touching and sad. I love it one of my old time favorite
B00AEFYVUQ|5.0|A lot of times when you haven't seen a movie in 25-30 years you find that your memory<br />was better than the reality. I loved this movie the first time I saw it in the 70's, and I loved it even more after 25-30<br />years in between viewing!!!
B00454U1NS|5.0|If you're a P!nk fan, you gotta get this album. I only wish A few more tracks were on it. How could you make a best P!nk album and not include 'Most Girls'?? Otherwise, it's a great 'best of' album. Growing up listening to all her songs, I knew there would soon come a best of record. Not many artist these days have the longevity of P!nks career or her talent. This would be a great gift for any P!nk fan. If you're thinking of purchasing it, stop thinking already, and just get it! LoL
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Love it, helps me relax and clear my head. Assisted is some of the best sleep. I would recommend this to anyone for sleep or meditation.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|My second book reading of hers and enjoyed just as much. Told in three distinct eras and point of views to bring the story together. At moments sad to think of things that can happen to others. If you like to be kept in wonder of a myster this is definitely a must. Partly set in Australia and partly in England.<br /><br />A little girl left on a boat on the way to Australia by a lady who says will be back but never returns... The little grows ip to he Nell and once grown she is told that she is adopted. The story picks up from there as to who her real family is and why she was left alone on ship headed to the other side of the world.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
0061150142|4.0|I enjoyed the book, but it was very long and dragged out. It took me over a month to finish the book because I simply wasn't interested in it enough until the last 100 pages. I was disappointed in the ending, because many things are left unexplained such as why she did what she did, and there's very little explanation of what happens between the two families after the trial. However, overall, I think it was a pretty good book and Picoult remains one of my favorite authors.
B003CRM6QO|5.0|Definently worth the money and wait, completely miss how great movies from decades ago are, glad that I saw the movie Ted to remind of how great this movie is
B008JFUNYG|5.0|Rated @ a 666!!! If you love the 'Evil Dead' trilogy then you don't wanna miss this one! Lots of gore galore, less humor which sucks however well worth the waot to see it!!!

0767919408|5.0|Oftentimes, we think of history in big chucks---the twenties, the 19th century, the Middle Ages.  We forget that certain years, or even certain seasons, have their own style and flavor.  This book is about one summer---the summer of 1927.  And what a summer it was!  The list of events that happened then is very impressive---Charles Lindbergh's flight, Babe Ruth's home run record, the first talkie movie, the boxing match with the long count that even a non-fan like me knows about, the \\"I choose not to run\\" quote---and lots more.  And Bryson writes about these events, and even more, the people involved, in a page-turner.  A good deal of the beginning of the book is about aviation---a subject that if you had asked me, I'd have said I have zero interest in.  But after reading that part, I was excitedly talking for hours to my airplane freak husband, fired up by the great writing.<br /><br />Bill Bryson does best at making people come alive.  He is amazing at using words to make you feel like you knew the historical figures he's talking about, and he makes almost everyone sound interesting.  He also is great at setting the tone of events.  I never really felt the excitement of the Lindbergh flight, or the feel of what Yankee games must have been like with Babe Ruth at bat, or just how life actually must have felt in the twenties until this read.<br /><br />Less major news stories are woven in the narrative here, and culture tidbits, like what newspapers were like then, who the popular authors were (and they weren't the ones that have had their reputations survive, that's for sure) and what crime stories obsessed people (I'd never heard of Ruth Snyder, but, boy, you would have back then!)<br /><br />I love the epilogue too, that fills the reader in on what happened to all the people talked about after the fateful summer of '27.  It's telling that you really do want to know, that history comes that alive.  I would say any history fan should read this book, but that's too narrow a recommendation.  Everyone who thinks they don't like reading about history should read it too, to come to understand how fascinating history is, when done right.arrow a recommendation.  Everyone who thinks they don't like reading about history should read it too, to come to understand how fascinating history is, when done right.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Don't expect some fantastic story or massive plot twist. The movie is about action stars doing what they do and nothing more.

B003V2HWP0|2.0|Ive seen several reviews that put Firelight at same calibre as films like north & south or pride and prejudice. This one suffers from an implausible obstacle put between the two lovers, that of a wife who is rendered comatose after a horse accident. Once the wife makes her appearance in the film, all I could think about was, &#34;what the heck is are they feeding her while she lay prone and motionless in a coma in the early 19th century?&#34; Killed the movie for me, as the wife would have died within days (not decades) with no way to provide her sustenance (aka a feeding tube). Who among the film makers overlooked that small detail?

B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved the KITE RUNNER . But this was a surprise. the characters were real and the cultural information was so valuable . I know so little about the Afghani culture and the Afghani people. This book helped me with both in a very enjoyable read.

1781164266|5.0|The Dead Space series combine a deeply developed background story, with amazing atmosphere and game-play mechanics. This book tells the story behind developing the &#34;look and feel&#34; of the environment, the characters, the monsters, etc. for all three Dead Space instalments. Particularly interesting are the &#34;Designer Notes&#34; throughout the book, explaining the evolution fo the different designs, and the way the story, characters, and the environments were &#34;interlocked&#34; to build up a coherent setting.

B0016CJNS6|5.0|After the 1967 pop-psychedelic `Satanic Majesties' project, the Stones returned to their rock/blues form in style with `Beggars Banquet' featuring some storming tracks which subsequently became all-time concert favourites. BB introduced the `main sequence' of classic Rolling Stones albums including `Let it Bleed', `Sticky Fingers' and the epic `Exile on Main Street'. BB was also the last time Brian Jones recorded with the band, though his contributions to the album are sporadic and generally unmemorable because for much of the time, he failed to show up at the studio.<br /><br />The opener `Sympathy for the Devil' sets the tone with ironic and edgy lyrics sung from the Devil's point of view, backed by a simple samba rhythm played on congas and vocal `whoops' to give it a primitive, raw feel. The high standard never lets up, with `No Expectations' the sole track where Jones' contribution really shines as he plays some mean slide guitar.<br /><br />There are no fillers on this collection but the defining track is `Street Fighting Man' which came to embody the spirit of student rebellion in 1968, and even now is often deployed as a soundtrack for film pieces about the political unrest of `summer 68'. In 40 years, there has probably not been a single live stones concert where SFM has not been performed. Other highlights are the R&B `Dear Doctor', the raunchy `Stray Cat Blues' with its overtly sexual lyrics, and the folk-themed `Factory Girl'.<br /><br />On BB the Stones finally found their definitive style as composers and performed with a new maturity & confidence. It still sounds fresh even in the 21st century, and is perennially voted into the `top 100 greatest albums of all time.'<br /><br />Due to a minor error in the original analogue tape mastering process BB was heard for over 30 years at a slightly slower speed than it was recorded, so the key of each song on all releases before 2002 is a semitone lower than performed by the band in the studio.  This was finally put right in 2002 when the ABKCO release restored the recordings to their true key and tempo. Subsequent releases (like the 2010 one from Universal) are at the original tempo and 30 seconds shorter than earlier versions, so if you want to hear the music as the band intended in 1968, buy a recent version.y put right in 2002 when the ABKCO release restored the recordings to their true key and tempo.

0066620996|5.0|Inexpensive for a great book. This is one of the few books I tell people... don't even question it... just read it.  I also buy it for others; it's that good.
B00BEIYMTW|3.0|This movie is too similar to Cars.  Sometimes I felt like I was watching Cars.  The characters are very similar and so is the plot, the visuals, etc.  It was a slight disappointment for me.  Disney should have made this movie a direct to DVD like first intended.  I know that this review is a bit confusing but so was the movie.  Mixed feelings towards this film.  Some of it was good while some of it was to similar to Cars.
B002ZG98C8|4.0|I guess that this movie might be considered a very dark sort of comedy.  The improbable ways in which hero Danny Trejo (as the title character Machete) dispatches various bad guys are often amusing.  I was particularly entertained by the series of scenes that find a wounded Machete in a hospital.  When the bad guys begin to close in on him, he spots a tray full of surgical instruments--just as the attending physicians caution him that these mean-looking scalpels and cleavers are terribly sharp and dangerous!  Needless to say, Machete makes imaginative use of these tools in carving up the bad guys!
B002QYUV5M|5.0|This is such a great movie with phenomenal actors and a brilliant script. It is hilarious and terribly clever and surprisingly dark. One of my absolute favorites.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|It was a laugh after another with some nuggets of wisdom sprinkled in. I highly recommend it for guys and girls alike.
B0053TMP24|4.0|My 10 yr old and I enjoyed the original series and we were happy to find this new set of books. Fun stories and also has led us to research the original Greek and Roman myths.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was amazing I usually don't read but I really enjoyed this book. Nicholas Sparks in a brilliant writer and I can't wait to read more. This book will having you in its pages for hours :)
B000GCFG7E|5.0|As usual, Lee Child writes a great book, difficult to put down and I cannot get enough  of Jack Reacher
B00CKJTVHW|5.0|One of my all time favorite TV series. Highly recommend. Even in the 7th season the show keeps you on the edge of your seat. It just never gets old.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I've been looking at this series off and on for a couple of years and have always passed on getting it. Because the movie is coming out one of my kids was bugging me to get it, so I finally bought it.  I think I was a little hesitant because I try and stay away from 'really dark' books.  This didn't get too dark, in my opinion. Little hard for me to get into at first but then I just couldn't put it down.
0786958731|5.0|D&D inspired board game that's great for two or more people. It's not D & D but it is a dungeon crawling board game with rules and play based on D&D. Add to that RA Salvatore's awesome characters and novel based missions and you've got a lot of fun in one box!
B00EH49DXA|5.0|LOVE this song! Different type of sound for Katy Perry and a pleasant surprise.  I haven't had a chance to hear the rest of the CD but I'm looking forward to it.  I hope the entire CD is as great as the song Roar.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|This is a great show to watch with your grandkids.  The action will suit them fine and it gives us a little dignity.  Violent, but not nearly as graphic as many current top movies.  Certainly a blending of the generations.  We need that these days.  Would love to see more of these types of movies.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I usually spend 1/3 the money on books that are great! Just sick that I spent that much on such a terrible read. Kept reading hoping for a big ending. Can't remember the last time I was so disappointed in a book!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this app!  Lots of fun seeking clues as each level is a little tougher than the previous. I hope they add more levels!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so awesome I love it just think of it as subway surfers but way way funner and also the only down is it can sometimes freeze your kindle so I say watch out.
B00CU0UE0E|5.0|This is one you can just put on and let play. Great overall album. I'm looking forward to seeing them live when they come around.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Enjoyed every moment.  I couldn't put it down.  I can't wait to read book 3!  Excellent and flawless writing style.
0152023984|5.0|A Charming and deeply moving account of a Little Prince and his search among the stars for someone to be his friend. At once a lovely story for children and a profound meditation on the  meaning of life for adults. The book is a children's classic.
B005LAIHUO|5.0|Loved the movie great to have a family movie night got it for a great price love amazon always get the best deals
0374533555|5.0|This book changed my life. I cannot express how valuable I find it... But on second thought, its more valuable to me the less people that read it...so, don't buy the book, don't read it, and continue to make the same judgment errors consistently with oblivion.<br />Kahneman is a genius and pioneer, basically responsible for the discipline known as behavioral finance. This book was actually a text for a graduate level course I took at UCLA. I am lucky to have explored it in such detail. Maybe the most influential book I have ever read in my life besides &#34;what to expect when you're expecting.&#34;
B008MM9630|4.0|I like playing this game sometime I have a problem with one quest but than the quest realize that I have done what they asked. great game people should play this
B00E3VTR1K|4.0|This is a group of scifi short stories with some very interesting concepts. I particularly liked Life in Prison and Forms of Love. The author explores his ideas through unique points of view and often surprises with startling endings.<br /><br />At times the translation of this book (from Italian) is a bit bumpy when it comes to dialogue, but it is worth the effort to wade through that to the meat of the stories.<br /><br />Be advised this book should have a sexual contents notice on it. For those readers who enjoy the erotica this is nicely done.<br /><br />All-in-all, I would suggest it to any reader that would like to explore a new up-and-coming author with a voice all his own.
B002R5HR70|5.0|good action, good music, add in some  romance ......also some laughs and you have a making of a great movie...
B00BNNJHXO|5.0|This album is Soilwork at there best. It's brutal, intense, complex, and beautiful. The only description that fits is masterpiece. Soilwork has managed the, exceedingly rare, feat of making a double album that's amazing from beginning to end.
B000IZXR7U|4.0|A little dated, but still good as The set up for the sequels. Too bad it is distracting to look at Mel Gibson, given his prejudices and unfortunate politics.
034580404X|5.0|My wife wanted this tri of books.  Amazon had the best price for the three of them all together.  She has now shared these with her friends.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I wanted to watch Fringe when it was on TV.  But so confusing.  Watching from start on Amazon prime episode after episode is the way to go for me.  Still confusing but know I didn't miss anything.  Great Sci Fi.  The gory stuff is a joke so it doesn't bother me like on CSI - more played for laughs.  That is just me but when the professor dude says &#34;great I love dissecting bodies&#34; it can't be for real right?
0425267695|5.0|I saw this in the \\"you might like this\\" category when checking out Brandon Sanderson.  I made a rash decision and went for it.<br />This is a remarkable first for this author.  I just hope it won't be years before we get to #2 & 3.  Like another reviewer, I thought<br />about starting it over again...then decided to wait until the second comes out.  I am very picky about my fantasy authors, he did not<br />disappoint at all...
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Google has created this for easy streaming for smartphones, tablets and computers on HDTV and easy installation in less than 5 minutes. Thanks #Google.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|If you like other Baldacci books, you'll enjoy this one. Will Robi is a new character for me, an assassin, and the introduction of the character made it a good read.
145210655X|4.0|Our kiddos have advanced mostly to chapter books, but I still enjoy this one once in a while, just for the theme.
B002LC2DQ4|4.0|Still have my 5yr old Olympus that requires this card. Had not had any trouble with Olympus cards in the past or now, works as always. But then again always bought mine from trusted retailers.
0141345659|5.0|loved this book. so well written and poignant. the author describes things so well, they seem real. I highly recommend it and I have bought three others by the same author!
B008BQ8YHQ|2.0|I found Season 1 of Suits available on for my Kindle Fire and loved Season 1.  The cast appeared to carefully chosen, the character development was consistent with depth, and the plots fascinating.  I looked forward with anticipation to season 2.  It seemed familiar, but it wasn't long before I began to wonder if a whole new writing team had been hired.  I found the writing to be terrible.  Short cuts were taken, unbelievable plots and subplots began appearing, and the dialogue began to damage the actual believability and probability of many characters.  I waiting, hoping that maybe the writing team was stoned for just one or two episodes, but finally give up on them and removed the season 2 from my Kindle.  I felt badly for the cast who had to work with such sophomoric writing.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is a great movie for the whole family. I recommend watching it before you see Despicable Me 2. It is appropriate for all ages.
B0044WSF5M|5.0|Even before this wonderful movie came out I wanted a T bird. Sweet memories it brings back every time I view it. They dont make cars like that any more.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is one of my favorite games. It starts out easy but increasingly gets more difficult as you clear levels. Try it yourself and see it is really addictive. I wanted something different than Angry Birds or racing. This game fits the bill nicely.
B000ZHBB0Q|5.0|I have seen it several times and just wanted my own copy. This is so worth buying for your collection
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This is arguably the best super hero movie ever. I am a long time comic book reader to see my favorite heros come alive on the big screen is really cool, but this isn't just a hero flick its a really good sci fi movie. I can't wait to see what comes next.
B00002SSKI|5.0|I have watched this movie several times, not quite a good as STAND BY ME, but well worth watching. It was nice to see a movie about young girls friendship that is still going strong into adulthood.
B001GKJ2FC|5.0|Great movie plays great and have not had any issues with it and the case and artwork were in great shape aswell
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a great series with great acting.  The writing is good cause it develops the characters so well.  You feel like you know them and of course you have your favorites.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Wow!  This was really fun!  It's a five star game, but there are only 10 levels.  I enjoyed the variety of activities.  Beautiful graphics.  I kind of want to live in the rooms  :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|All the&quot;run&quot; games out there, and none have been appealing enough to pull me in. Minions did it, smooth gameplay and loss of fun minion bits keep me playing despite frustrating millisecond timed losses.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I really enjoy this game. A pro is that in the begining it doesn't tell you what to do that much. A con is that you have to buy diamonds in order to get some like a 16th of the Dragon.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie yet and love The Wizard of Oz this is a def see. It is a totally new way to see it but not so far away from the true movie that it would leave you wanting. Just need to watch and you will see.
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|this game was fun and addicting game that I played in all my spare time. the. ad part was it put a virus on my kindle. you get dud of it by deregistering and reregestering
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Every book gets better and better. Time to start the next book. Deg going to have to get the cds.
B0002VFXFE|1.0|The product is entirely unnecessary since the cool master Seidon  (see below) supplies the compound with the cooling unit, waste of 8 bucks.  Amazon would serve their customers better by simply checking what is inside the cool master box.  My opinion would change if I could return the compound for a refund.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|How could I have a kindle without this app. It is the greatest way to stay in touch with family and friends all over the world.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Long, complex and utterly engaging. This is one of the best fiction books ever made. A brilliant accomplishment by a great author.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Wonderful novel!  All throughout the book my emotions were running in different directions. I felt as though I was a member of their family. Highly recommend the book.
1449410243|5.0|This book is very funny, especially for cat lovers.  I was laughing hysterically when I read it and continue to read it again and again.
B00338QENI|3.0|Skloot does a good job of highlighting the personal, ethical, & scientific aspects of this story though at times her tone of writing seems condescending to the subjects beyond just illustrating their background. It is easy to read and flows nicely from chapter to chapter except for the section covering the youngest son towards the end seems out of place and like it was added simply as a courtesy to the family.
B004U8VX2M|4.0|I must first give full disclosure, I turned tho this series after watching all of Downton Abbey, casting about for something else to fill the time.  Since this was recommended on Amazon as a &#34;people also viewed&#34; I thought I would give it a chance.  It takes a while to warm up and I was a bit disappointed that many of the plot lines were not really resolved.  I love Rose, Jean Marsh's character, but found the upstairs personalities to be a bit shallow the downstairs ones a bit flat in some cases.  That being said, I did watch the first series through and enjoyed it.  Elizabeth is a fun character and so is Sarah.  It would be great for some of the men to be as enchanting...in any case, a decent watch but not as good as Downton or a good book.
B008M0NDOK|4.0|the games that can be played with this instrument were only several, l have played them once and once and hope a new game could come soon.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love mlp!!!!<br />totally cute and fun game. I suggest it for any kid at heart!!!! only bad thing I can say is it takes too long to earn certain things.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome review of the first time I thought it was cool and I thought it was cool and I thought it was cool and I thought it was cool and I thought it was cool
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Solid Kindle cover with options for both horizontal or vertical screen viewing, used as a stand for reading, so you just slide your finger or use the stylus.
B00785P2QC|3.0|It's ok. Things cost too much. Sizes of buildings are strange. Just started playing so I'll give it more time.  I won't ever pay actual money for this.  So so rating right now
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I have used this knife sharpener a couple of times already.  Works pretty good and nice and compact.  Nice tool.
B00992CF6W|3.0|How do I play? When I  play survival mode, no monsters show up! Please tell me what to do!  I like creative  mode.  I think it was worth the money just to play creative  mode
B001Q2ZHZE|1.0|nasty content, not what I want to see when I spend 9.99 to relax after a long week.  Really a dark, dark, movie - that should be clear in the desription.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Good grafics easy to control great characters easy to see the play area not to overpowering quality of game play is good
B00DP3IESY|4.0|This is a fairly complex plot, and the clues are very subtle until about 3/4 through the story. I think the love interest is a bit over the top however, and kind of muddles the primary plot rather than augmenting it.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I've only been playing a while, but so far I'm enjoying it quite a bit.  A basic Dungeon Crawl, everything you could ask for in a rpg.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|Part tech treki, part mystery Mr. Penumbra's 24-hour Bookstore was all about the people in the narrator's life whether past, present or unexplained.  He acquired uniquely talented and multi-qualified people of all ages willing to assist him in solving the bookstore's peculiar puzzle.<br />The narrator, Clay, sailed through the novel with minimal complications providing the reader with few opportunities to predict the next event.  This novel used Google extensively and perhaps like the great search engine itself, all the varied characters seemed one dimensional.
1781162646|5.0|It's the summer of '73, and school's out, but college student Devin Jones finds himself at loose ends when his girlfriend takes a job in Boston, along with a friend of hers, leaving him behind.  Not sure what to do with himself, Fate intervenes when he finds an ad in the back of a magazine. Help wanted at Joyland.<br /><br />And thus begins the summer that will change his life forever.<br /><br />Joyland is an independent amusement park in North Carolina whose mascot is Howie the Hound. All the kids love Howie; he's an institution. After a quick interview with Fred Dean, Devin is told to look around the place, see if he likes it, and that's when he meets Lane Hardy and Madame Fortuna. The fortune teller tells him about a little girl with a red hat, carrying a doll, in his future. Also a boy with a dog. Not that Devin believes in such things, but he listens politely. And he decides to take the job. While he's there, he reserves a room at Mrs. Shoplaw's and returns home to get ready to come back for the summer.<br /><br />Devin quickly learns the ropes and the talk, and before he knows it, he feels like a real carnie. Part of his job, it turns out, is playing the part of Howie the Hound, a hot job at best in that big old fur suit. But thanks to that suit, Devin changes lives. And things begin to come true.<br /><br />He finds himself becoming more and more invested in his life there. Which is good, because what he thought he had was nothing more than an illusion. But can he be sure that what he thinks he knows is real? Especially after he saves a life... and then he meets the boy with the dog... and his mother. And then there is the girl who was found murdered in the house of horrors...<br /><br />If you're looking for a typical Stephen King horror story, stop right here. This isn't that. This is not horror at all, so forget your preconceived notions. This is good old-fashioned thriller in the noir tradition. With a twist only Stephen King can give.<br /><br />Devin is the narrator, so we see everything through his eyes, as this becomes a pivotal summer in his life. The story is told years later, as he looks back on what was. It's both a coming of age story and a whodunit, mixed in with a touch of the supernatural.<br />The writing is pure Stephen King. It flows smoothly. I found myself finishing the book in record time. The characters are well-drawn and memorable. I would recommend this not only to Stephen King's fans, but to those who love a good murder mystery.<br /><br />This is a return to an earlier Stephen King. I confess to having not read him in a long time, but I think I shall have to pick up the habit again. I hear he has something out called Dr. Sleep - have to check that out next.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Typical, not as good as Echo, better than dye trying.<br /><br />Killing Floor still his best, then Trip Wire.<br /><br />1st half is a little slow to take off, finish is OK.
B003H4I4JU|3.0|You can tell that more words does not make a better novel.  Such is the case with this work by Orson Card.  I wish he had sorted out the plot beforehand, but you can tell he plugged holes everywhere to shore it up.  Fortunately Orson's other works tend to make up for this wavering first attempt at providing literature for the consumer masses for profit.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Almost makes up for its sad subject matter. I laughed more than I cried. Well written. It's hard for me to give a sad book 5 stars due to the emotional component.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Maybe I'm just hooked but number 10 was better than number 9. I liked but didn't love numbers 1 through 8but the last two I read we're great, 9 and 10. On to number 11!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Can't believe it is free....can't think of a feature it doesn't have except it doesn't turn on the coffee.  Grin.  The ads do not get in the way.  And I wake to my music...soft to loud...with easy to reach snooze.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Bad guys lose, good guy wins and gets the girl in the end! Love it. Finally, a movie that shows a REAL damsel in distress not some snooty hooty in Hollywood! And the good guys aren't some robotic hero we are all use to seeing!
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I just started playing about an hour ago n I like it so far. Haven't had any problems yet.hope to complete it and see the end
B001NHNG64|5.0|I loved this book. I passed It on to both my husband & sister.  Lee Child's 1st book with the character jack Reacher called \\"The Killing Floor\\" should probably be read first, but the others can be read out of order.  It's a detective/action  mystery.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This app runs very smoothly, and has an all around great way of transforming pictures to art its really cool
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I loved this movie and it's something for the whole family and above all I loved the teachings and beliefs and use of non-violence! This little movie was actually a blessing!! It's now one of my new favorite movies of ALL time!!! Very Good!!!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|You are totally invested in the characters in this book and hope that they find happiness. Learning the meaning of each flower was a bonus!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm totally hooked!  I love the royal family as much as their staff!  You need to watch the seasons in order.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We hadn't seen any of the episodes live so watching them on Amazon and being able to catch up was wonderful.  I can't wait til Season 4.  Thanks, Amazon
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Definitely watch them in order.  I love this show!  A friend asked me which character was my favorite and really, they all are so well developed/played.
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|Strong, likable characters and engaging story. Even the side characters are really good. Overall, I would recommend to anyone who likes good dramas.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|This series is the complete package! It is smart, funny, sexy, witty, compelling, and an absolute must see! The character development is amazing. Possibly the best show on TV.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|A wonderful return to days when I too lusted for success at the steam table, prep room, broiler, at the wheel, on the line, all those elements that are required when trying your damnest to please others via your sweat, time, pain, energy and insight. Just for the food.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|All the basic arithmetic is here.  Big keys and easy to read displays.  Recall features are nice.  Don't overlook the additional math functions if you clear mem and swipe over the mem keys.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun game. Wish it didn't use energy up so fast and that was easier to recharge. But it's addicting and I enjoy playing.
B005HJ6MRO|1.0|Works great on 2 android tablets, but opens with blanks white screen only on my Kindle. Western Digital, you need to fix this!
B005G4TJUC|5.0|My grandson asked for this.  He is eight years old & very much into Transformers.  This was a movie he did't have.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I loved the minion rush game beacause I think it is very creative and it is a very good game for children
B0050DZ8J0|2.0|I don't know if its the ap or if its site overall but its complicated to maneuver.  I have people that I know is on linkedin but not in my email contact list and it's almost impossible connecting with them.  The purpose of me downloading this ap is to connect with the people out of state to network not contact the people I speak to everyday. I know none of them have any job openings.  The ap or the site needs to be simplified.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|I bought this app, super excited to play it. When I open it, it says I don't have it. I close it. Try to open it again.  Doesn't open.
B000TEUSJU|5.0|Shipping: I have always had a very good experience with Amazon, and this was no exception. They shipped the movie very quickly with no problem and even arrived before the delivery date.<br /><br />DVD: As far as box sets go the Imperial Edition of Caligula is the only way to go if you are thinking of buying this film. It has the X rated version of the film, and a pre-release version of the movie, and a third disc with many special features on it. The box set doesn't include the R rated version, but in all honesty, that version takes away what makes Caligula so good, so stay away from that version.<br /><br />The Film: Caligula is one of my all time favorite movies, but you have to be careful who you are watching it with. Caligula contains many scenes of graphic violence and strong sexual content throughout the who entire 2 and a half hour film. As far as film goes, it shows one of the very few movies that gives us the raw unflinching nature of pagan Rome. Malcolm McDowell gives what should have been an Oscar nominated performance, and it has some of the most brilliant sets you could ever see in any movie. Caligula has a very haunting score that can give you chills when listening to it.<br /><br />Overview: So Caligula definitely lives up to the hype that it caused when it was released, but that shouldn't be your only reason to view it. Caligula is a very powerful film that makes you think, but not too hard. Check it out if you can, but stay away from the R rated version, because pagan Rome wasn't censored, so why view a film about it in a censored form.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|I loved this book and it's ins and outs of before, during, and after being president of the United States.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Your emotions will be taken on a roller coaster between characters as the story unravels.  Brilliantly written with craft.  Keeps you interested and enthralled and wanting to read more and more.  By far Gillian Flynn's best novel.  The main characters, especially Amy, are interesting, crazy and witty.  You never know what is going to happen and when it reveals itself, you are delighted with how crafty the two characters can be!
B00A285OOW|4.0|The story was good, but got a little redundant in places.  It could have been told in the shorter novel.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|After reading Gone Girl, I had really hoped that Gillian Flynn's books were going to be spectacular.  However, like most authors who produce one amazing novel(Gone Girl), Gillian Flynn definitely isn't capable of producing a second.  I was highly disappointed and saddened that this book was not what I had wanted it to be.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|If you are like me and love comic movies then this is for you. A lot of talent in this one. Can't wait for the new Marvel movies.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|feels like air hockey...i play it often even with my husband.  graphics are really nice.  I can't wait to show it to my grandchildren.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|The customization you can put on each alarm is incredible.  I've been using this for a couple years, and the only alarm failures I've had were if I forgot to charge my phone overnight and the battery died, and one instance when my phone somehow picked the wrong weekend to change the time for daylight savings, but either of these are obviously not the app's fault.<br /><br />Simply put, I have had no reason to do any more searching for alarm apps since finding this one.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|The app is helpful for my 6th grader in helping him look up words for school and knowing the definition as well
B007FG9LIE|4.0|\\"Pines\\" starts off reminiscent of the kinds of short stories Stephen King used to write back in the 80s and early 90s. Stories that were indubitably inspired by The Twilight Zone with the kinds of original twists that only King's mind could conjure.<br /><br />There's all of that -- and a lot more -- in this novel by Blake Crouch.<br /><br />We have our protagonist from Seattle who wakes up bruised 'n battered in an Idaho forest, with no memory of how he turned up in the middle of American nowhere. His explorations into the nearby town reveal it to be a slice of heaven called Wayward Pines which is almost picture-perfect charming with its pines, mountains, Victorian painted houses and crickets.<br /><br />Soon enough, he realizes that he's been in an accident and that he's a Secret Service Agent (also an ex-chopper pilot during the second Gulf war) tasked with locating other Agents who ended up lost without contact, in that particular town.<br /><br />And that's where it enters X-Files / Lost / Twilight Zone territory. One of the said lost Agents ends up dead in an abandoned house while our main guy, Ethan Burke, battles with bits-and-pieces of memory as he struggles to figure out the truth of his predicament and the fate of the second Agent -- who also happens to be an ex-flame.<br /><br />All this time, he faces escalating strangeness, hostility and the madness of the town's authority figures who wield devil-like power over the equally maniacal townspeople.<br /><br />Mysterious events at the local hospital and unsavory encounters with law enforcement heighten the sense of fear, reinforced by violence. They reveal the complicit evil that lurks just a layer or two below a seemingly perfect and otherwise \\"normal\\" society. That is the source of real terror.<br /><br />As the town's true darkness belches and eventually explodes to the surface, he finds himself trapped in a recurring Kafkaesque nightmare, unable to get out of the town and disconnected from the world outside of it. There's no road out of town, and unless you want to risk getting lost in the pine forests or navigate the sheer cliffs, you'll learn to stay put in the town (\\"Don't even think about leaving town,\\" says the town sheriff).<br /><br />It's like he's hopelessly trapped in a separate reality, in a different time, that brings him to question his own sanity (the classic what's real versus what's unreal question).<br /><br />Interestingly, there are clues throughout the story that point to anachronistic things. Things that would seem out of place in modern times, like rotary phones, dinosaur computers, and a weird, implicit sense that things like the iPhone and the internet don't exist in this town. Yet, there are means and devices to keep track of people, their whereabouts and intentions (\\"they are watching us\\").<br /><br />If you grew up in the 70s, 80s or 90s, reading the books and watching the quintessential movies & supernatural TV fare of the time, you will find that this novel is both a homage to those stories and a well-crafted page turner on its own.<br /><br />It's a reflection of society and the ability of the human brain to adapt and lull itself to its insane horrors. People tend to do that when their survival depends on not questioning those horrors but actually accepting, embracing and even celebrating them as part of their very being.<br /><br />It's like ritual sacrifice or some perverted mass religion. Perhaps even a cult of brainwashed followers who won't mind metamorphosing into a mob primed for massacre. (They actually look forward to the gruesome lynching and the inevitable celebration afterward.)<br /><br />The town of Wayward Pines is a metaphor for a psychological prison (human fear) that's somehow too beautiful to leave even when your brain is screaming for freedom and your mind is on the brink of collapse. Instead, you convince your mind to think otherwise.<br /><br />You fracture it so that it stops complaining. You break its will tocomplain.<br /><br />In the same vein (and perhaps ironically or paradoxically), this very insanity is also about survival, preservation of the self and a certain way of life. It's also about evolution, albeit a selective one.<br /><br />Sure, there are some cliches, coincidences and unrealistic descriptions. Below are some of the most glaring ones:<br /><br />It's an incredible thing for the main character to keep going despite his harrowing ordeal (lack of food, rest & sleep deprived, being injected with sedatives, generally beaten up quite often -- on top of being in a car crash that killed his partner early on in the story). There are further acrobatics involved later in the book.<br /><br />This requires some major suspension of disbelief and makes for an incredulous point in an otherwise strong story. Perhaps you could say that he was being driven by the adrenaline of fear response and a basic human survival instinct in the face of unfathomable horror.<br /><br />Perhaps. Maybe. Poker face on that. (How much adrenaline can a depleted human really have? How much can you actually push the body against such daunting physical tasks?)<br /><br />Another annoying thing is that the character is running around naked in situations that require his full attention and powers to simply survive (happens in at least 50% of the book). It's cold, raining and night, mind you... And he's either missing shoes, a shirt, or running around in a hospital gown.<br /><br />At one point in the story, there is implicit agreement that he's not dressed suitably for the occasion of being potentially murdered by the mob. To quote a line from the book: \\"Under no circumstances could he run naked onto Main Street.\\"<br /><br />Right.<br /><br />Lastly, the part where it's explained what the whole point of the story is all about, let me put it this way -- you will either like it or hate it. I found it interesting and unexpected though a little jarring given the larger context. I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />As a whole, the novel reads like a social experiment packaged as a survival story -- though the exact genre is difficult to ascertain or pin down. There's horror, thriller, some pseudo-sci-fi and violence (lots of violence).<br /><br />What works for it, though, is the consistent pace, twists & turns, characters you will care for, and a driven plot. Strong enough ingredients for a quick read.<br /><br />I would rate \\"Pines\\" 3.75 stars (rounded to 4). That means readable, thrilling and fun.<br /><br />P.S. On a side note, I believe the novel has quite a few cinematic elements to make a good TV movie or a survival horror game.
140006922X|1.0|You expect that the author would check the facts and when he translates the Hebrew Holidays into English, he would consult<br />the Rabbis at least. For example for the Shavout he translates into  two weeks????? Are you kidding  me. It is Matan Torah ( the  receiving of  Torah).
B009EEOM7K|5.0|It is just a fun movie to watch. It is not to be taken seriously. A dark sense of humor helps.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Cute game, educational in a sense that you learn about the ocean floor &amp; Icelandic life. Great graphics &amp; soothing game sounds. Not over done or annoying
B007B5EDEG|5.0|This series is fantasticly written and well thought out. it is absolutely brilliant and the tv series based on these novals kept to the entire books and didnt leave anything out! I loved it botg books and film are brilliant and i highly recommend both
140006922X|5.0|I have read extensively on Jesus of Nazareth, and thought that I knew most all of the theories.  Aslan's  scholarly, well-written book proved me wrong.  This book is compelling!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Awesome!  Defiantly want more!  I hope she writes another three books. And looking forward to the movie!!!! Until next time...
B00CPTUN5G|4.0|Despite the shudders and \\"end of the MLP fandom\\" speeches once the first images and trailer were revealed, I was still willing to give Equestria Girls a chance. It's not just because I'm a fellow Brony [albeit a 'hipster' fan of My Little Pony], but also because I am a fan of animation in general. Luckily, this film didn't disappoint me in theaters or on DVD.<br /><br />The plot is pretty basic but unfortunately predictable as our newly-crowned Princess, Twilight Sparkle [*spoilers if you haven't finished Season 3!*], journeys into the strange new world of Canterlot High to get back her crown from a thief named Sunset Shimmer before bad things happen in Equestria, but luckily, Twilight meets humans that look very much like her friends back at home... and guess what? Friendship is still Magic, regardless of the predictably of the film.<br /><br />The animation is really good and fluid like in the show, and the human character designs work out for most of the time [especially with the Mane Six and Sunset Shimmer; they're seen as both humans and ponies at least once]. The main characters [this counts for known background characters too] stay true to their character, in my opinion, and the human versions really are decent High School mirrors of their Ponyville selves. I especially think just watching Twilight adjust in this new place and then use her special skills to survive is really amazing compared to her from the first episode of the series - watch the entirety of Friendship is Magic so far and you'll notice how much she's changed, and it shows here in this movie. Props to the writers for keeping this consistent!<br /><br />Hard-core bronies will definitely enjoy trying to spot consistencies with some dialogue and scene similarities, human designs of certain ponies, and the end credits with things they know and love from the show. Also, the bonus features focused on the making of the movie aren't bad... though they could have been meatier, given the fact that a lotof adult fans of the show will probably buy this DVD. Kids will love the bright colors and the really good songs [thankfully there's a karaoke sing-along bonus on the DVD!], as well as the continuing adventure of our favorite characters... in the form of human teenagers that kids can relate to. It also teaches a decent message about friendship that every kid should know, and they make the journey to learn said message very entertaining. Parents shouldn't have anything to fear with the colorful, sparkly content, though a couple of parts near the end might be frightening for some younger kids.<br /><br />The only real flaws I have are that the movie could have tried harder to surprise viewers with parts of the obviously rushed plot. I did get a bit of a surprise near the climatic ending, but it went back to Planet Predictability about a minute later. Also, some of the major grown-up characters in Equestria got some really awful human designs [I'm mainly looking at you, Celestia and Luna], but it's not that big of a nitpick. Also, plot is rushed... very, very rushed, but it's for the running time, I'm sure.<br /><br />But in the end, did I enjoy it? Yes. Definitely yes. It felt like an Alternate-Universe episode of Friendship is Magic, and I think that's what Equestria Girls is meant to be - just that. At least there's something decently good for MLP fans to watch until the premiere of Season 4 later this year! If you're a fan or if you live with little pony fans, I highly suggest you pick up a copy of this DVD and don't mind if a song or two gets stuck in your head afterwards!
B004UPANAI|5.0|A great movie, full of excitement and action.  Good for the comic book lovers!  Would recommend viewing the entire series.
B0032SQCQI|3.0|An odd story about a device...a small box with a button on it...given to a couple, who are asked to make a choice: To press the button, receive a million dollars...and someone they don't know will die, as a result...yet they will not be blamed for the death. Or NOT to press the button...receive only one hundred dollars...and the box will be &#34;re-set&#34; and given to someone else? A strange, quirky film with some bizarre plot twists and unexpected consequences. 'Not too bad if you're really bored.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|This was on the list of choices for my daughter's 7th grade summer reading.  Although she does not enjoy reading, she did enjoy the book.  She would recommend to the 7th grade reading level.
B0063IH60K|4.0|OK version, but has too many commercial interruptions to feed the money machine that sponsors the website. Free games are never free as asvertised.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|the grand daughters love it. What's not to love?! It is not hard to listen to/hear if you didn't love the movie.
140006922X|5.0|It is based on historical facts and what the religious traditions were at that time. Basically it makes one think and to base thoughts on true facts and not on mythical tales. Much thanks to Reza Aslan.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Held you captive all the way though. Never got slow or boring. I especially loved the Hulk. And of course Ironman is never a let down...
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Some will be disappointed by both the price and the size, but this set has become a collectors item. I think the scale is perfect and lego is the obvious medium to bring minecraft into the physical world. I really like this set. I comes with a wide variety of extra pieces to add on and customize it and also a small brick separator.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|VERY DETAILED.LOTS OF GOOD STUFF AND PLENTY OF MYSTERY....SHOWS HOW THE CIA AND OTHER AGENCIES OPERATE.WORTH READING...MANY SURPRISES THRUOUT STORY
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Netflix and youtube look great. Massive improvement over the 360's interface. At ~$11 with the Netflix rebate, it was a steal. I'm looking forward to amazon instant, pandora and whatever else is coming.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This is a well-written story.  I am still on the fence of how much I liked/disliked it.  I was afraid to read it b/c of the story line - I thought it might be morbid....it was NOT.  It was a joy to read, but of course it was sad too.  I don't like books that make me feel sad, but I think the moral - which we are all quite aware of, but usually do not follow - &#34;live life to the fullest&#34; was worth the tears.<br />  I couldn't put the book down.  It is worth the read, but I am not sure I would recommend it.  It is just too hard to explain -- haha...I guess you have to read it.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I bought this on a recommendation, mostly to make fun of the person who made the recommendation, but ended up playing it for several hours straight.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Not sure what I just read -- it was the oddest book.  I guess calling it a &#34;fairy tale for adults&#34; is correct.  It is very well-written.  Holds your interest, but is so odd.  But I liked it.  Go figure.
B008NR91DO|5.0|I had heard the name Gary Moore as a good guitarist, but until I got this dvd, I did not realize how good he really is...  He displayed versatility, along with quick fingers on the frets.  I guarantee that I will watch the dvd again and let his playing ability sink in a little deeper.  I would recommend this dvd for any aspiring guitarist to watch--even if you aren't necessarily a Hendrix fan.
B005ZO6NRA|3.0|Completely predictable. While a lot of films in this genre are as well, there are some that are just a good adventure. This one was just flat, from the story to the acting to the cinematography.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I like the way the author presented the material and delved considerably deeper into everything about how habits affect our lives. Habits seem like they're as instinctual as breathing. The comparisons made toward the end are remarkable and if you understand the science it really does make you think about some of the people's stories and whiter or not they were guilty for their actions
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|good beach reading.  i was pleasantly surprised by her inspirational words of advice to career women.  tina fey is smart, witty and gracious.
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|The movie had excessive violence and at times made no sense. Was very difficult to follow what the movie story was attempting to show me. The ending was terrible and left one hanging. Did not like it at all.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Nothing bad to say about this classic work of literature. Mark Twain is awesome. I think I enjoy Huckleberry Finn more than TATS, but it's still great. It was nice to get the free version for my kindle!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a fun challenging game which keeps you busy for a long time and is a fun cool game which I enjoy and I hope you will enjoy too! Xx
B008XCJ03K|5.0|Passenger's music cuts right to the soul and surprises tears to my eyes each time I listen to a new composition.  Mixing quiet yet innovative folk music with scintillating lyrics, each song makes keen observations on the hidden truths of human nature...  and it is impossible not to envision the mythology of your own life experiences entwined with each thoughtful verse.  Very rarely does a talent like this find voice in the world, and I can only hope that this traveling troubadour has many more songs to share with us all.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|A word of forewarning this book is not for the squeamish or for children. If you can stomach torture scenes and enjoy the backstabbing nature of politics in a fantasy setting then you may find this book enjoyable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game but I think the keys should be free in the shop where you get boosts because it shouldn't be like 3.49 for 40 keys because that is just expensive
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love percabeth!!!!! Oh my gosh they are the best part in the book:) I wish there was more of them though:(
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Let me  just be honest that this good was okay, and quite interesting but there are some parts that just get boring. Like for example the sex and orgasms scenes. WAY TOO MUCH!! And at first I like  Christian Grey but by the end Thu  guy has issues. Overall it was alright.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|It work perfectly so far when I first got in the mail. The problem with it being is the way when you get charge up and playing on device it takes longer when your on it.Hope that sentence makes sense. Thank you Amazon!
0316056898|1.0|I read the first 3 pages and she already mentioned Sarah Palin, the environment, played the race card and made several of the lamest, try-to-be-jokes I've ever heard. The only thing interesting about her is her scar and THAT's the one story she won't tell.  Typical Hollywood Elitism. What a mistake I made buying this. I couldn't delete it from my kindle fast enough. Yuck! (I want to rate this zero stars, but I'm forced to leave at least one star. sheesh!)
B003E8GQ76|5.0|If you are a frequent traveler, you will definitely love this movie.  (Everyone else will too).  Great cast and story.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|This is just what I needed. A quick,engaging read that stirred my inner artist. I'm passing this along to all my friends, creative or not!  Wonderful book!
B002MFULQO|4.0|No matter where you stand on the JFK conspiracy theories this is a great movie to watch.  Awesome cast! Really makes you think.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun game and quite addictive. I'm sure the makers are making a killing off in game purchases but still fun without spending a dime!
B0089EHWQE|4.0|although somewhat predictable, the characters are so engaging that i stilll loved reading this book.  the author got inside the narators head so well, i felt like i knew her well.  funny, sensitive and a nice book to curl up with on a patio lounge chair.
B007ZUV63I|5.0|Love anything to to with knitting stories. The women's lives were so intreging, didn't want to stop reading. Can't wait to start the next book. Downloading the whole Blossom series to my ipad. They're the sort of books that I'll read over & over.
B00B5AIB50|5.0|This is a very interesting film which shows Karajan in the recording studio. You can see a facet of his personality which does not show in other films. Highly recomendable!
B00EI6E17A|5.0|MAKE'EM TOUCH... TOUCH! YOU SHOULD LIVE FOR THE APPLASE TOO SO BANG THE GONG WITH GAGA AND CHEER AND SCREAM FOR APPLAUSE!!!
B008RV5K5E|5.0|One of the best animated Batman stories I've ever seen.  An aging Batman returns from retirement to fight and defeat the worst criminals to hit Gotham.<br /><br />He also must square off against his best friend (Superman) and worst enemy (Joker).<br /><br />As others have stated this is not a cartoon for kids.  The violence is extreme but the story is great and shows that how the driving force that first created the Batman has not disappeared over time.<br /><br />The movies can learn something from the animated stories.  Stop re-telling the origin every time and create something edgy with the time saved.  We all know where Superman and Batman had their starts.  Show us Superman fighting Brainiac or Batman at odds with Superman.<br /><br />Parts 1 and 2 are one complete story.
1400067820|3.0|I haven't actually had time to read the book yet, but I have heard really good things about it.  I am excited to read it when I have the time.
0812981448|5.0|I read another book that I feel you should read. It is by Blake Mycoskie which many of you don't know the name, but you know his company TOMS shoes. This is a story about his journey along with what he believes are the keys to getting started with your own goals. Below are my 4 key ideas that really stuck with me and my own personal thoughts. You can read the book to hear what he has to say along with many other ideas. These are not his key ideas, but were key to me with where I am in life right now. 1. How do you define success? I don't know the real definition, but I have come to realize that success goes beyond status and money to include the idea that we should be working on something that enhances the world while living a life that fits your own terms and ideas. 2. The Power of Stories - Reading this book is a story. It grips your emotions and forces you to connect. Stories are much more powerful than facts or data. Numbers don't connect on an emotional level. You can use data mixed in with stories to connect them. Think of your favorite teachers and you probably remember stories and not the content. This is true with life in general and yet we often times forget the story part when we teach. 3. Don't fear the unknown - embrace and find out what is on the other side of the door. As you do this you will make mistakes, but remember that life goes on. Reading this story reminded me of the current journey I am on with a new job with many unknowns. Additionally, the unknown of writing my first book has left me slowing up the process. This book made me realize it is time to take the risk and throw it out there. What do I have to lose? Nothing! 4. Keeps things simple. Don't over complicate matters. I personally do this all the time and is something I am working on everyday. Another idea that mixes in this mindset is you don't need a lot of money. Use what you have around you to get started. There are so many free tools, websites, and discarded materials all around that we can find what we need to get started. We think we must have all these resources to get started, but being crafty and simplifying things will make life easier. Once again I have another book that has empowered my mind to go after my goals. I have taken a bit of time of writing my book. Yes, I have made those excuses of being too busy presenting, going back to school, etc. They are excuses. There is never a perfect time to write. Reading this book has inspired me to get back on track to accomplishing what I feel will help others. Please give this book a read and know that 50% of the proceeds goes to a funding program to help programs that will help others. This is another must read that I recommend to everyone. Thanks to Coach Norm for telling me to read this book. I might make this a must read for my students on my robotics team and sports team as well. Great message that really inspires. - See more at: [...]t we can find what we need to get started.

B00E4ZOQR0|4.0|Does this even need a review? Seriously, if you are a fan of Lego and Back To The Future movies, then this is a must have. Built this with my son and it now sits proudly in my classroom. I love receiving questions about this vehicles from students and responding with movie quotes. Another must have in the Lego collection.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I got this bag to replace my shoulder-slung bag that Canon sold me in a package with my first DSLR.<br /><br />Most of my photography is done at air shows. There's usually a bit of a walk between the gate and the flight line. With both my father and I attending a show and taking photos, the old Canon bag was loaded with two DSLRs, two telephoto lenses, camera cleaning equipment, extra batteries, and a camcorder. All this led to a heavy, ungainly bag that was a pain to lug around an airfield all day. Getting a backpack-style bag for myself seemed like a great solution, and it was.<br /><br />This bag easily fits my Canon 7D with a 70-300mm telephoto lens attached, a shorter walk-around lens, my Sony HDR-SR11 camcorder, camera cleaning equipment, and various cables and spare batteries. The inside of the bag is lined with soft Velcro loop material. This pairs with Velcro hooks on detachable, movable soft panels in the bag, allowing you to customize the inside to fit whatever equipment you need it to. Within a few minutes of taking it out of the box, I already had it set up to perfectly fit my gear.<br /><br />The backpack setup makes the bag very easy to live with while walking around an event. It has both a chest strap and a waist strap, but I don't really like those on any backpack, so I left them alone. The only potential &#34;gotcha&#34; some people may have is that backpacks don't allow for quick lens changes like side-slung bags do. I don't change lenses in the field a lot, so this isn't a problem for me. Another plus for the backpack form factor is that it doesn't scream &#34;Camera bag!&#34; to the casual observer, which helps with theft deterrence.<br /><br />I only have one gripe with this bag. Along with the panels, you get two straps with Velcro hooks at either end. These straps span the compartments you make with the panels and are used to hold your heavier items stationary. Unfortunately, you only get two straps. This was good for holding in my 7D and mycamcorder, but I would like a few extra straps to hold any other lenses I may bring with me. For the compartment I made for my spare batteries and cleaning equipment, I ended up using some extra panels to go over the top. Even with this, I did have a battery fall out of the bag when it was opened vertically at a bag check entering an air show. This problem certainly isn't enough to cost the bag a whole star, though, and you can get Velcro strap material at any hardware store if you really need more.<br /><br />All in all, this bag is great for someone looking for an easy way to carry a camera or two around an event. If you're bringing multiple DSLRs and tons of lenses, mics, tripods, etc., you may need something bigger, but for my amateur photographer, single-camera needs, it has just as much space as it needs to.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Superb adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's Victorian novel.  Atmospheric, with a wonderful cast and a poignant and memorable score.  If you are looking for Pride and Prejudice with a social conscience, look no further.  Mr. Thornton wins out on Darcy in every quarter, and Margaret Hale is as superior a heroine to Elizabeth Bennet as Shakespeare's Portia is to Popeye's Olive Oil.

140006922X|4.0|Of course there have been thousands of books written about Jesus from every point of view. I found this one to be worth reading because it's written by an academic but is told in a way that the average layman will not find boring and tedious. The book makes some interesting points about the historical Jesus and the setting in which he lived and died. I don't agree with some of the writer's conclusions, but then everyone has his or her own opinions about who Jesus was.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|Probably the best collection of Hawaiian music available.  The movie was good too - especialy when the old man pops Sid!
B002DOSBMK|4.0|Salvatore has a clean style to his writing.  This book would appeal to the hardcore fantasy reader and the occasional alike.  Terrific start to the Drizzt story, it will make you get the next two books soon after you put it down.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I first saw comments about the introductory chapters of [[ASIN:B00873GRU4 Wool (Wool Trilogy 1)]] on a friend's Facebook wall last year.  I was intrigued, but life gets busy, and time went by.  That same friend was posting excitedly this week about the release of the conclusion of the trilogy, so I thought \\"what the heck, I have a few hours to kill and the first few chapters are free.\\"  That was yesterday morning.  I finished the entire book at 6:30 this morning, having read through the night.<br /><br />I may have to reevaluate that friendship, considering the questionable ethics of introducing literary heroin to a bibliophile.  However, I am now eagerly awaiting the opportunity to read the next two books without imperiling my health, marriage, or career by refusing to sleep.  In other words, my only regret about staying up ridiculously late to finish reading Wool is that I am now too much of a wreck physically to immediately start in on [[ASIN:B00BFUB9MW Shift: (Wool Trilogy 2)]].<br /><br />While Wool stands quite well on the quality of the story it tells, it is more than just another well told post-apocalyptic tale.  With each new character we meet, we are introduced to another perspective on life - and humanity - within the silo, shaped and shared through the mind and senses of that individual.  Actions and the people behind them gradually bloom into three-dimensional complexity, continually challenging what we think we know, and it is only through the combined perspectives of several different characters that we begin to understand the breathtaking complexity and brutality of life after the fall.<br /><br />This is not a story for the faint of heart, as these are gritty and troubling times in a gritty and troubled world, but if you enjoy a complex, layered, and nuanced story about humanity under pressure, you could do far, far worse than to download and read the first few chapters of Wool.  Just don't blame me if you are a zombie tomorrow...
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I loved this series and was very pleased to relive the excitement in a marathon of viewing.  It's gritty and touching and I'm not proud for rooting for the success of these hoods in the hood.  I've loved CCH Pounder ever since I saw her in Bagdad Caf&eacute; and the entire cast is wonderful.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|An entertaining yet educational movie for all family members.  Dealing with a close family member that is struggling a life issue, it has given me strength to know that the remaining family members have to carry on with life and adventures.
B00005N6KG|1.0|These are good, if a bit fragile since the sound eventually drops out in one ear.. Were great when they were $9 and disposable. At $40, forget it.
B0025UHKNS|3.0|I've used other garmin watches with HR monitors before and I have liked them much better.  I absolutely hate having to utilize the bezel to maneuver through screens.  It is touchy and jumps around a lot.  Hard to maneuver through each screen to get to the function I need.  I gets good satellite reception and seems to find the satellite very quickly so that is a positive.  I also like the fact that it is not too bulky.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|The plot for this book was very intriguing. I finished it in just a few days because of my need to know what was going to happen between the two characters.
B00AEFY0F2|5.0|.  This is a great movie to watch with the family.  I saw it when it first came out and my grandson wanted me to buy it for him.  He really liked the movie and so did the rest of the family.  Tom Hanks is awesome as always.
B00DCRE7M0|5.0|As someone who owns every DT release as well as James' solo and Mullmuzzler releases you can trust me when I say this one is an absolute must have. As usual it takes a good three or four spins to start to \\"get it\\" and then your hooked. A great warm up to the new DT album to be released in September (the 5.1 mix should be outstanding)
B00CF34B2I|5.0|If you like games where you almost get goosebumps then you'll love Magic 2014 plus you'll love the card game MAGIC THE GATHERING
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I really enjoyed this film. As always Tom Cruise was amazing. The story kept you wondering and thinking and doubting the entire time. Excellent choice for Sci fi lovers!!!
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I LIKE it... but is too short. But,hey it's better than nothing. If I LIKE it. Than you should like it. Samdoesminecraft out...
B001EC0OMM|2.0|I went into this film expecting to see a Jimmy Stewart movie. Instead, I found that it was just another Cary Grant flick. Stewart's role is very small, in spite of the fact that he won the Best Actor Oscar, and it certainly is not his best performance.<br />As far as the film itself, I was surprised to find that it was reviewed so highly. The acting from the cast (minus Jimmy Stewart) was sub-par. This was filmed in the period where every actor (once again, minus Jimmy Stewart) seemed to favor a clipped, fast delivery to a smooth, natural one. It is hard to hear everything the actors say because they speak so fast. Katherine Hepburn is rather annoying as a typical feminist, and Cary Grant shows almost none of his usual roguish charm. There is practically no soundtrack, and the script, which reviewers seem to think \\"fizzes with wit\\", tries too hard to be clever and falls flat on many occasions.<br />The morals usually prevalent in films in which Stewart takes part are conspicuously absent. Almost all of the characters are drunkards, and at least one is having an affair outside his marriage. It tries to accomplish the task of making Hepburn's character more warm and loving, but throws the morals necessary to achieve this out the window.<br />I had high expectations of this film, but was unfortunately disappointed. It did not succeed on film-making or moral qualities. Not typical of most of the classics of the golden age of movies.
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|Absolutely loved reading this. A well written look at the modern human experience. Race, politics, religion, love all in one great read
B0036S4B6M|5.0|She is an excellent writer. Really great insights into life.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is struggling with finding meaning in life.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This is the best game ever. SUPER awesome I. I ACTUALLY THINK ITS FUN AND FUN AND I'M 17 so what I'm a girl even adults like so why should not. Even if they didn't I would not care I love this dress up game and its the 1st one
B0026772N8|5.0|There are books that have changed your life, and this is one of them. This is the 25th Anniversary addition and is more meaningful for me today than the first time I read it. Basically, it is a philosophy book of understanding the differences between classical and romantic personalities.
0061992860|4.0|I wasn't prepared for such a tiny book, but I suppose its all the better to throw in your get out bag.  I read through it quickly and realized that it was a great resource for any nature activity.  My 10 year old son picked it up and absolutely loved it.  He's excited to spend time in the woods trying some shelter, fire, and slingshot building.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|George just keeps me coming back with his 5th installment of the Ice and Fire series. I cannot wait to see what he does next.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love these short hard workouts!  I've been doing them 3x a week for the past 3 weeks and I can feel a big difference in my muscle tone.  I mean I actually have some muscle tone.  I have been eating a healthy diet and have also lost a few pounds.  Jillian talks a lot, and the music gets repetitive, but Its the workout I'm there for, so sometimes I just turn down the TV and crank the radio.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan but he has done some classic sci-fi performances. &#34;Oblivion&#34; is by far the best I've seen in a long time. Definitely a MUST see!!
B0002I831S|5.0|star trek the original series season 1 is one of the best season of a show I have ever seen I mean its fun it appropriate for kids its just a great show and the collectors packaging looks fantastic and will make a nice edditiion to NYBODYS DVD LIBRARY
B008602KQI|4.0|It was a good movie.  It wasn't a five star movie, but overall it was pretty good.  You should watch if you have the time
B0090SI582|5.0|Hugh Jackman kills it and his dedication really shows on screen.  A great film, but very different from other X-men movies.  Scene during the credits is worth the price of admission alone!
B006GWO5NE|3.0|I bought this cord to charge my Kindle Fire, however it seemed to have a short and would not charge the Kindle like my older cell phone cord. But it does have a nice sturdy design that is stronger than cords I have used in the past and the longer length is handy as well.
B005RZB65Q|5.0|Carol Dweck seems found the holly grail of personal transformation.<br />Practicing growth mindset will shift not only you ,but as well your beloved ones.<br />You will become better parent,better partner,better learner just simply you will become better you.<br />The book is awesome!
B001BR5F4C|5.0|Firstly, I don't consider myself an avid collector of movies. When Kill Bill I & II was released, I was working in SE Asia so I did not have an opportunity to see these movies. However when I recently returned to the US I saw them both on cable TV and I was &#34;hooked&#34;. These movies are incredible. The story line is classic; revenge. The cast was expertly put together as I don't come across too many movies that the individual actors play their parts as expertly as those in these two films. The merger of the &#34;old&#34; martial arts genre with the &#34;spaghetti western&#34; genre and classic movie format was again expertly done. Lastly, the music is phenomenal. I now listen to it while working and relaxing. A great collection for everyone, of course above a certain age.
0345529057|3.0|The first two books have been good. A little predictable, but good. It is hard to not draw parallels with UK history when reading this though. At first the character per chapter motif was fresh and interesting but now 1/2 through book 2 it's getting a little stale.
B004RCUJ9E|4.0|I tried it on my Toshiba Thrive and had absolutely no problems with it. I only gave it 4 stars because it's been so long since I've played checkers that it beat me on the easiest game so I could not check out the upper levels.<br />If you like checkers I think you will have a lot of fun with this app.
B0050DIWFC|1.0|This was a depressing and contrived book about how the connected try to avoid justice. the end was disturbing and not in character for the one who took action
B00BG0RSJ4|5.0|This is a great movie that shows a parents love and a child's quest for indepenence.  Loved it! Highly recommend it for kids of all ages!
8866135887|4.0|I am pretty particular about my paper planners (never quite adjusted to more technologically advanced options), and this one fit my needs quite well. I like that it's small and fits easily in my bag, and it has plenty of space for notes on each day. I also like the bookmark, the pocket in the back with space for extra notes, and the sleek classic moleskine look. However, the print is pretty small and the dates don't have clear dividing lines between them. I used a highlighter to separate the days and found that it was easier to navigate this way. That's my only complaint- otherwise, very happy with the purchase and would probably buy it again!
B003O86FMW|4.0|A story full of deep emtions, that reflects the actual situation of the social problems we are facing as human beings. It is a powerfull trilogy, that makes us think about the way we are abusing our environment and the way man kind is becoming a daring predator. The main character is strong and brings hope, strength and the will to do oir best to make the world a better place
B0085RZGYU|5.0|Even with know characters, Baldacci can work his magic and surprise you at the end.  Let's hear it for the Camel Club.
B009R659L8|5.0|I have read every single book . I am never disappointed. Thank you for another great read<br />. When is the next one?
0446615625|5.0|The camel club is an improbable group of characters with improbable backgrounds.  Baldacci takes this and makes you want more.  He also follow up with other books using these characters and gives you what you want
B00CRNCEQ6|2.0|Like many teenagers I read this for the sex and so over 30 years later have reread this as it is a Classic. However, while it is interesting for its time as it is quite sensual, I am not sure if as much would have been made of it without the sex. The writing style has frustrated me with whole pages of repetition and sentence construction that ended up being plain annoying. There is a lot of very obvious reflection on the age, the advance of mechanisation and the rise of the middle and working classes alongside the dying of the aristocracy. Clifford in his paralysis and his insistence on the life of the mind seems too obvious a symbol. Mellors and Constance's love affair, if that is what it can be termed, never really feels right. Lawrence runs on about a woman's heart and essence a lot, but ultimately sees the woman as only coming alive with a good ****. The sex scenes are sensuous but of their time, after Fifty Shades I daresay all such writing might seem tame. That is not saying I appreciated Fifty Shades either, I cannot understand the insistence now on open pornography. A bit of subtlety is a lot more rewarding. I am sure that I should appreciate a classic more but the style of saying the same thing twice in the same sentence with slightly different emphasis just annoys me. In writing about sex, Lawrence writes as a man and does not seem to like or understand women very much.  Bizarrely, Mellors states that a woman who can't &#34;come off&#34; without some self help is the Lesbian type  whether they know it or not! He does resort to euphenisms  though when talking about some aspects, for example anal, such as the elimination of shame and the italian way. Overall though, Austen achieves more passion and sensuality without once mentioning a phallus.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|After A thousand splendid suns and The kite runner, this book is a disappointment. Cliches and predictable twists and turns abound. Khaled Hosseini appears to be writing a a screenplay this time.
B002P79KAC|5.0|great
B00846REIS|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!!! Got me hooked. :) I think it was better than fifty shades of grey. Amazing :)
B002QCD2OG|1.0|After reading so many glowing, gushing reviews about how \\"brilliant\\" this movie was, I was extremely disappointed. Christopher Lee must have been pretty hard up for cash to do this flick.  Best thing I can say is it was so bad, it was funny.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Sounded interesting<br />Reading the book you thought you knew where it was going and the reasoning in the end it was nothing like I expected
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works fantastic. Love how it shows you the last equation used on the screen, makes it alot easier for balancing your checkbook.
B00CEB5QU2|4.0|Ipad's don't have USB port or card readers, so this gadget is wonderful to see movies, large flies, read pen drives by wifi!<br />Is fast and we can share those files with two more iPads or iPhone's at same time, I love it!
B0063IH60K|3.0|For the most part it a very good app. However it locked up on me a few times and had to be wiped and re installed<br />.
0756405890|5.0|This book is perfect. Don't take that lightly, I read a lot of books.  And this one is exactly that, perfect.  It draws you in from the first page, it is full of eminently quotable lines, laugh-out-loud humor, tragedy, romance, magic, and mystery.  It is abnosome  (abnormally awesome, for those of you who don't subscribe to Misha Collins GISHWHES cult).  It makes me remember the thrill of the first time I read the Hobbit, how excited I was to fall into this immersive world and how fresh and new it seemed to see it pour out of the page and into my head.  This book is a must read for anyone who even vaguely enjoys this genre, and probably those who swear they don't.<br /><br />Read it and fall in love with Kvothe.  I promise you won't be disappointed, he's kind of amazing.
B000089RVX|5.0|Definitely a soul searching album.  I love the song &#34;My immortal&#34; dark but uplifting too.<br />Will definitely buy further albums from Evanescence.
B008AX1HD8|5.0|He keeps us on the edge. I love the flawed character, Harry Hole. It's great finally after reading all the other books to find out what happened in Sydney which other books always refer to..
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I dont really like these kind of books but this was different not a bad different but it was pretty well written
B009LGO88E|5.0|Really high quality, worked perfectly with my 3DS XL, had no problem at all using it and the battery lasts for a long time, would recommend to anyone looking to play games like Monster Hunter or Kingdom Hearts using their 3DS
B00C2VIA52|4.0|I REALLY like this game it encompass magic and strategy very well. I have played many games over the years, and this game blends all the other card games together. My wife says I'm obsessed with it.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Exactly as expected. Fits perfectly. Dropped my phone in the toilet, washed it and it still works great! I would've liked the teal color, but pink was $20 less so got that. It's a nice color despite that, much better than expected!
B006OB3K56|5.0|For me, this film was not about the main story. Maybe it was intended the way, or perhaps it makes you view the character more closely. Nonetheless, the film and cinematography  really help you view the smallest more intimates pas of a human relationship.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoyed the game and the way it works. My only complaint is the ads popping up after each game.  The game is challenging enough to keep my attention.
1400069807|5.0|Like all books about food lately this is one is nearly impossible to put down! I wish it had a few more references.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Good, easy app.  Does everything as described.  First time using app and back on ebay purchasing thanks to ease of use.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|There truly is music everywhere. This movie is one that inspired me to take up piano lessons. Lost the first copy we had, this one is going into locked storage.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Really great game to get your mind off the days hustle and bustle. I play when I'm about to go to bed. I can't seem to get pass Vector:( but all the new tasks are so exciting!
B00D7JGL36|4.0|in the mid-50s while guitar hero but producer villain Chet Atkins was ironing all the fun out of Nashville, Buck and Merle and some boys out West were energized by some alternating current and goofy sequins and created a sound that would not only bring country back to Nashville, but launch progressive country and country rock and eventually dominate Nashville entirely.  They also wrote some damn good songs.  Gill is at top of form - he's one of the best country singers ever and an under-appreciated picker. He sings the style with respect without caricaturing it, dancing over the swirling waves of Paul Franklin's steel melodies.  He recorded it at home and asked some friends over well, he has some really talented friends.  I'm not an everyday country fan but this is great fun and a tribute to an interesting time in American music.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love this game it is so upbeat and fun it is very colorful and awesome your money will be spent very well.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|It's short and like previous Pink's books it turns world a little upside down, showing that sellers and buyers are human and what truly motivates them.
B003XT603Q|4.0|I like it when I mull over this book for days which I am doing now.  I feel very sad and I wonder if there are more suicides in Japan than in the rest of the civilized world.  Make sure you read this when you are in a good happy mood.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|reminiscent of Little House or Medicine Woman but set in early England.  Great Family viewing; good values and morals. Clean and<br />sincere.  No canned laughter to spoil the humor. Love it!
B0042J6VUS|4.0|Not a good idea for cellphones protected with Otterbox covers.  Works well for cellphones without covers.  It would be nice if the manufacturer would design the tripod to expand wide enough for a cellphone with Otterbox covers.  Initially thought about giving it a &#34;1&#34; rating and then figured, it really wasn't designed with covers in mind - however, anyone who values their equipment has it protected with a cover (small oversight).
B009PNQUXO|1.0|Not great ap. it is useless and should be deleted. I am about to uninstall mine. Thank you. It is not useful at all. Please make sure that nobody falls for this again. YouTube is the best.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love this. I'm of an older generation and never thought I could text like my kids do, pressing those little keys with their thumbs. I can use this easily. It seems to know what you want to say with it's predictive software. It fixes your typos and capitalizes for you and even  puts the spaces so you don't have to hit the spacebar. Every once in a while it gets a word wrong, but fixing an occasional word while typing this fast is a vast improvement over my previous text typing speed.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|Great Klingon episode that introduces Kern Worf's brother. Tony Todd who later stars in the Candy Man movies is great.  This episode also introduces us the Duras family.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|I love this!! There are so many options, and you can save or send the pictures, or even draw on top of an imported photo. There is also a constant mode that keeps the drawing going and changing after you've stopped based on how you started. The bright colors on black look best. It's mostly just fun to doodle.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|Almost everything about the case is great.  I would have preferred they made it just a touch smaller.  It overhangs the device - I think they could have made it a little smaller.
0142410705|5.0|This is the first John Green book I read, but definitely won't be the last.  The humor, romance, characters, dialogue, and insane plot had me riveted from the beginning.  As we follow the two main characters on their road trip from Chicago to rural Tennessee we are treated to lessons on love, life, and philosophy that will spark many a conversation.  The characters are truly memorable, and this is a book worth spending a few hours with.
B005R32L66|5.0|Used it on my computer, now I can use it on my tablet.<br />It doesn't do video on my tablet, but that's okay.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Fast moving plot, goods char<br />acter development,great imagery.<br />. One of his better book<br />Nice on the<br />Kindle 8\\"... even in the sunlight<br />.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I don't regret spending the money. It's worth it.<br />It handles MS Office files and keeps me working wherever I am
B004ZG5EYC|5.0|I recommend the French language version (this) and enjoyed with English subtitles. Fine visuals and good sound presentation  Blue-ray version was acceptably clear.
B00DU73T08|2.0|way too much confusion with the host talking back to the girl actress. Not very captivating. A few chase scenes, action sequences not very tied together as one plot.
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|I prefer the minimalist approach and this app delivers. I see what I need and exit. Keep up the good work.
B000AYEL6U|4.0|I saw this unusual mini-series when it first came out and was impressed so when the opportunity came to buy the DVD I took it up.<br /><br />This is a much harsher story than the usual Jane Austen fare and strongly illustrates the Victorian English dichotomy.<br /><br />As usual with British production, all the values are high; the script, the sets, the action and the atmosphere (you feel you could choke in the cotton mill).<br /><br />One in the &#34;once a year&#34; category.
B000ICXQUQ|5.0|I cannot stress enough how much this movie means to me. It's the one and I mean ONE and only movie that makes me cry. From beginning to end, it sucks you in. I love everything a out it. Costner is great and so is Liotta, but the great James Earl Jones outshines them all. I gave it 5 stars only because I couldn't give it 100. However the SELLER is bout a one star.  I STILL have not received the movie yet...over two weeks now yet it says it shipped 14 days ago...order the movie but not from this seller.
B000T433CO|5.0|Loved this cute movie! Kate Winslet, Cameron Diaz, Jack Black and Jude Law were great. I also love the idea of switching homes. Been looking into that now in my home.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Solid little app, works as advertised. I like the dimming features since I also use it a s a stand clock. The worded clock is a little creepy but I suppose the weather status makes up for that.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Like everything James Rollins writes, this is another great book in the Sigma Force series.  I really like that we learned more about the background of Seichen, she appears to be one that is going to stick around for a while.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I like this a app because it ties into my alarm clock. The features and inflammation provide is excellent when checking against the local l casters; I tend to stick with this more lately.
B0091VTNZC|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone!  Makes me laugh like its the first time Ive seen it every time I watch it!  Will Ferrell Has a way of making you really believe he's an elf or at least that he believes he's one lol
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evermore keeps track of all my lists and quotes and clips. I can access it on all my devices. And the search feature is simple and effective.
B00CVPB966|5.0|With Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling, Giovanni Ribisi Nick Nolte, Emma Stone, and Sean Penn all putting in stellar performances! Outstanding!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game and completely addictive. I have a bad habit of playing it every day.  The fact it is a free game is an added bonus.
0142410705|5.0|John Green has a wonderful gift for story telling, if you have read his other work this doesn't disappoint :)
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book was better than what I expected after reading the previous two books from Khaled Hosseini. I absolutely love his style and his stories in one book. Can't wait for his next piece.
B006LSZECO|5.0|You think you know the end half way through....keep reading, you're wrong! Well written and  easy to read. Makes the time pass quickly.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Its so far okay only complaint is that it runs a bit slow on my kindle fire hd but still a good game
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|This app is okay but the bow is hard to use when aiming the bow. it's doesn't always go where you want it too.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Wonderful show I just LOVE David Tennant!!! He is the best actor ever!!! A series I will love to buy.
B000002JPA|5.0|Find all you need in your mind, if you take the time!<br /><br />What an absolute game changer of an album, I only wish I had the musical knowledge to express just how moving some of the tracks are. I'm a few dozen plays in and still feel like I did the first time I heard it... wow.
0756405890|5.0|Everyone I know who has read this book is hooked and feels that it is one of the best they've ever read
B0067TQQI8|3.0|I love the concept of having a device to charge all my gadgets, but the cord does not work well.  The anker astro 2 does charge fast when the cord is not shorting out.  I would like for Anker to send me a better set of cords and adapters.  If not for that, it would get 5 stars.
B00338QENI|5.0|By telling a compelling story, this book conveys the enormous (1) social changes in America (2) changes in the business of medicine, and (3) scientific and medical significance of culturing human cells,
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Nice app, easy to use and not too far off most of the time, not any doing with weather.<br />Keep on keeping on
B00ANA27IU|5.0|Decided to read this again after 30 some years. Even though I Remember the final outcome. I was captured by Arthur C. Clark\\"s descriptive narrative. Once more he capture my attention and keep me captivated. Which proves great story telling never gets old.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved Stephen King as a youngster, but had not read a King book in over a decade. This book was great.
B001F8VRLM|5.0|impressed that the first edition had all the key characters and situations and some actors in minor roles returned later for major editions.  very creative and funny right from the start.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|I really can't wait for book  number 4 and more of Eva and Gideon's story. Read all three books in two days!
B005K17RU0|3.0|The latest update has changed the format dramatically, and not for the better. They have done everything they can think of to run me off, but I'm not that easy to get rid of. Holding out hope they will see the error of their ways.
B00BEIYH6U|4.0|So I saw this at the early showing Thursday night and loved it just about as much as the first one, but I feel this new director didn't take any real risks. Matthew Vaughn took what he read in Mark Millar's Kick-Ass comics and made it his own, where Jeff Wadlow just took what he read and saw in the comics and threw it on screen with only a few changes.<br />  I like to see movie versions of books or comic books as a sort of a cover song where the person taking from the source material isn't afraid to make some changes. The writers didn't have much to do for this movie because the dialogue is almost word for word what it was in the comics. same goes for the action sequences.<br />  BUT, luckily the source material is good enough that they were able to put it on screen and make a great movie. Although, I would like to see less shaky cam next time Wadlow.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|i like it just as much as the first one  im so glade i  brought  them I love them all  thank you
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I read this to my kid ...and more than a few times we have stopped to consider and talk about what we had just read. How we treat people with less than us, how we look and judge so quickly...how it makes them feel....they notice. Its a great book and both you and your 4 - 6th grader will too.
B002IDH4PQ|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend and he loved it and still does! It came in great timing and I bought it to give with the PYLE-HOME PVTT2UWD Retro Belt-Drive Turntable with USB-to-PC Connection. Favorite track is &#34;Pursuit of Happiness.&#34;
B005C0DHEY|4.0|It makes sense that natural gas would get into the ground water if they are drilling near your house...  The other chemicals that are used in the drilling process really need to be studied and regulated.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Point blank, without this, I'd never type on my phone.  I bought a Bluetooth keyboard when I originally purchased my phone, thinking it would be 10x easier than using any on screen keyboard.  Then I logged into Amazon Marketplace and realized I had orchard this app for free during one of the daily app giveaways years ago.  I haven't used my Bluetooth keyboard yet.
0596805527|5.0|You have to want to know all about a subject to wade into one of the O'Reilly 'Definitive Guide' series of books.  This is no beginner's book.  It covers the subject well, and the few times that I have used it, the index will get you where you want to go.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Love this game.  It is highly addictive!!!!!  I have played similar games but this one is much better.  I love the graphics.
B0052OZJQO|3.0|Realy love Pina's work, the movie, and obviously the music. So I was a bit disappointed by this CD which contains only part of the movie soundtrack, if you want the all thing buy something else.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Not a fan of some of the goals are to post on f as Facebook, but a pretty fun game
B00AFEY354|5.0|I was a bit reluctant to write about this film as I am the 914th reviewer.I thought at first what's the point, but I loved it so much I thought it was worth offering up my perspective.I must point out I haven't read the book.Having said that my enjoyment of a film adaptation,not having read the book, for me, is sometimes an advantage, as more often than not I find the film disappointing.I must admit however, that this is not always the case.<br />This film also, reminded me of the John Hughes films of the 80's.Most specifically 'The Breakfast Club' dealing with a few young misfits or should I say quirky,shy, unique individuals who have their own private fears about starting or being in high school.While dealing with their own private demons and social issues they are thrown together, or in this film's case are drawn to each other, to try and survive and navigate the minefield that is high school.Combine this with a brilliant soundtrack and you have the ingredients of a classic feelgood movie where at the end you think to yourself what a fantastic film.I got the same feeling from 'The Shawshank Redemption' and 'Almost Famous' to name a couple.Speaking of the soundtrack there's a classic scene just after the beginning when Charlie,Sam(Emma Watson)and Patrick (Ezra Miller) are driving somewhere and they hear what Sam describes as 'the perfect' song on the radio.None of them know the song.This compels Sam to implore Patrick to take the tunnel.Sam finds out the name of \\"the tunnel song\\" at the end of the film.A classic song by a legend in the music industry,which made me feel a bit old ,much to my dismay.They go through the tunnel again near the end of the film with that song playing .Their characters have evolved so much by this time and as a result they are much closer.After having been through so much together, Charlie says in his narration \\"and in this moment we are infinite\\" this final scene compared to the same scene at the beginning brings a tear to the eye.<br />I won't go into what happens in the film as in my opinion a good review hints at the possibilities that the film may offer up.I will however touch on certain points which will give you an idea of what goes on.Lets face it,if you haven't already seen it or read the book and after the 900 or so reviewers before me you must know what its about anyway.<br />I thought Logan Lerman's performance as Charlie was brilliant.His character arc was very well told.You are given a hint  near the beginning that he has a buried childhood trauma, which as the story unfolds makes you realize in subtle ways that this is affecting the way he reacts and responds in certain situations.It works to his advantage however in a cafeteria confrontation which helps redeem his status with his friends,especially Emma Watson's character, after having been ostracised from the group for a couple of weeks due to a social faux pas.<br />I could relate to Charlie's character as I too was very shy in my early teens.Starting High School for me in 1970 in an all boys public school in Australia was very scary.The school was a survival of the fittest situation which was really shoved down my throat on the first day, when two fourth formers (year 10)got into a fight where one was carted off to hospital and the other one was covered in a fair bit of blood.<br />Anyway,I digress.The way the film deals with complex adolescent issues such as homosexuality,drug use,violence,suicide and family is dealt with very well.By the end of the film you are left with a feeling of contentment as these characters help each other mature,evolve and grow strong together, as they rise above and get closure from the baggage of their past.<br />The scene where Charlie gets \\"baked\\" at a party,comes out of his shell and lets fly with a few home truths about the main characters' and high school in general is a classic.Soon after this he tells Sam about his best friends demise,she tells Patrick (scene stealer Ezra Miller)and he immediately gets accepted into the group after which Sam welcomes him \\"to the island of misfit toys\\" , the film takes off from there.I must mention the subtle but standout performance of Paul Rudd as Charlie's English teacher.This is a classic case of less is more as this actor has lately starred in over the top comedys'.He manages to encourage Charlie without pushing him as he sees the potential the budding young writer has.<br />This is going in my collection as I thoroughly enjoyed it and you should too if you haven't already.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is super fun and I like it a lot but a lot of stuff costs dollars you have to buy with your own money but other than that it is super fun and I play it all the time

140006922X|5.0|I bought the hardcover version of<br />\\"Zealot\\", due to seeing the author, Reza Aslan's<br />appearance on \\"The Daily Show\\" (airdate: 07/17/13).<br /><br />After listening to this brilliant scholar<br />(including the extended interview with John Oliver)...<br />I KNEW this book would be for me.<br />[[ASIN:140006922X Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth]]<br />AND: It would also be a book to read for those that have been lead down a path of lies and deceptions since their early youthful (or otherwise) indoctrinations as \\"Christians\\".<br /><br />To sum up the greatest attributes of this fine work, I can only say five words:<br /><br />HISTORY, PEOPLE.<br /><br />ACTUAL RECORDED HISTORY.

B0074VTHKM|4.0|The kind  of book that was interesting to me and I wouldn't mind recommending it to a teenager. It was a good read.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|After the first 4 books I would have thought the fifth was to be the end. My opinion is that it has extended to much and my friends reading it or finished are not even planning to continue reading. It also is under consideration that there will not be book 6 and that was the end of it. It is a pity that there are no clear hints of another book and this goes against the success of this saga
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Jenn was awesome looking that's about it! It was poorly written they showed no woodsmanship not even the basics that they teach in survival schools
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I love this show. I got hooked the first time I watched it. You will love some families and some you will hate.
B00DYOOGYK|4.0|the storyline is good but some of the vehicles are bugged such as the police chopper and the tenderizer monsyer truck. the gun on the heli refuses to fire, unlike in rio where you could shoot from the chopper,  and the tenderizer cant crush other cars
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I watched seasons 1 - 5 in a matter of weeks to get ready for season 6 in September.  This has to be one of the best shows EVER on TV.  I don't think I've ever watched a FX show until now.  I will be a loyal fan of SOA until it ends! Watch it; you won't be disappointed!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I belong to a book club and this novel was a hit with everyone.  Khaled Hosseine captures the real human spirit with it's strengths and weaknesses in a way we can all relate.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Better than expected.  I guess for $75,000,000 they could have done better CG.  It had its moments.  I am glad I waited to see it for free.
0446693804|5.0|I can't say that I haven't enjoyed any of Nicholas Sparks stories and would recommend them to anyone who enjoys reading.  I've read most of his books.

B004KKX814|5.0|My kids love this blade...it's made well, spins fast, beats all the other blades in my kids collection. Would recommend.
0307474259|5.0|I've always wondered why certain medications make you gain/lose weight, why my friends who seem fairly active or are picky eaters are over weight. And on a more personal note, I wanted to know why even though I exercise regularly I NEVER lose weight. This book answered all of those questions! It provides all the scientific evidence for why eating less and exercising more doesn't work! I didn't read this book cover to cover. I don't have the brain power. I read the chapters that were of most interest to me and skimmed the rest. If you're doing everything conventional wisdom tells you to do and you're still not losing weight, read this book!
0071771263|5.0|this is a really great book,our school kids  like this very much.and they want one more i think. amazon is great place order books too.
B00AQM7T74|5.0|Very nice Steelbook, a must for collectors or fans of this movie. I purchased this version because I wanted a collectors version, This is the only one I found.

B00DDXJRJG|5.0|I own a KFHD7 so the sound was pretty good to start with, but this app really lets you configure the highs and lows, and mid-ranges.  It comes with some pre-installed sound waves such as rock, dance, flat, normal, etc, but the custom waves are it's best feature!!  You can just experiment with the sounds, and create & name the customized waves you like.  Some songs sound too low and bassy to me, so I configured a wave that increases the treble.  The options are truly endless.  The description of this app states that it's better to use headphones, and yes, the subtle changes you create are most noticeable with them on, but it also improves the sound when not using headphones!  This app rocks (pun intended).  ROCK ON, AND ENJOY!!
1608871827|5.0|I loved the film and this artbook is one of the best I have. It includes a bunch of info, cool inserts of robots. Very glad with item, This is an Art Book done Right!!
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I was up all night reading this and could not stop it is simply amazing and has so many twists and turns. James dasher is simply an unforgettable writer! Read this book series I can assure you'll  love it I this is the most amazing book series I've ever read and actually admit that I like it when the hunger games .... which is just crazy
1416955070|1.0|Wish I had looked into the background of this author and the story more before I read this. Bad writing, bad plot, not worth the read. I have no idea how it's so popular. It's like she's trying to to go down a checklist and tick off every box that appeals to YA readers and therefore does not do any of it well.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved it! I don't normally read suspense/crime, but it got me hooked. I couldn't put it down until I the next bombshell hit. Great book!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|It was great and enjoyed watching it.<br />I would have to say everyone that they need to watch it.<br />Love it.

B000002UY5|5.0|On of the most underrated bands ever recorded.  Consider &#34;Nico&#34; as your next purchase.  It is, what I believe one of the best rock/alternative albums.<br /><br />On this album, when listening to &#34;change,&#34; turn the speaker balance to the left or right (can't remember which side) when the song begins and enjoy.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Look, there's already a bunch of reviews from professional geeks that will give people all the techy-savvy info.<br /><br />I love this thing because one reason.<br /><br />My wife can have something already playing on the TV while I embark on my mandatory \\"1-hour\\" search on Netflix for \\"the perfect movie\\".<br /><br />I'm a simple guy, I don't need this thing to revolutionize my life.  But I definitely take my sweet time when picking something on Netflix. So now with this thing, my wife can watch her favorite Ryan Gosling movie while I spend the next 60 to 90 minutes looking for the that documentary on jellyfishes that can juggle albino mole rats.<br /><br />And when it's time to switch to my movie, I don't have to get up, I don't have to unplug or replug anything, I don't even have to deal with two separate browser windows on a laptop, I just need my phone.<br /><br />No device or smart TV allowed me to do this for $35 in the past.<br /><br />People are already hacking and programming more functionality for this device.  I can only see the possibilities of this device growing.
1594202842|3.0|I grew up in a very culturally diverse city and I could have written this book about everything I know about discipline by Chinese mothers.  The thing to take away from this is; There are many cultures that raise their children in this manner.  All she is doing is selling books about her personal life. This does not mean that if you follow her lead, you will have gifted children too.  It's just an Ivy league graduate showing off.  Don't waste your money.
0316201545|5.0|I read this whole hard cover book in a single day. I just could not put it down as I found it even better than the first.<br /><br />When the evil fairy from the Sleeping Beauty story kidnaps their mom  and fairy godmother grandma Corner and Alex returns to the land of stories to search of her.  Teaming up with Goldilocks, The Frog Prince, Little Red Riding Hood and Jack they set out on a quest to create a mega wand powerful enough to stop The Enchantress. The problem is the wand has to be made from want some of fairy tales greatest villins treasure most.  All of people favorite characters return, grow in more depth in character and continue to be that much more enjoyable than you remember them as they cross paths with the likes of the snow queen, the sea witch and many more.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Free and fun to play with your kids.  What else can you ask for.  I would recommend this application to others.
1401923127|5.0|I love how Bruce writes, he really makes me understand that in a twinkling of an eye, I can take my  mind, my body and my destiny to a beautiful new dawn and change the  course of my life ANYTIME I am ready, and not to be limited by dusty, rigid , calcified thoughts that are not really me, they are just an old file that needs to be updated and the program needs to be replaced with a new program that supports my conscious dreams.<br /><br />Bruce spreads ALOT of genuine hope, don't forget his other book The Honeymoon Effect.
B000V6I7WG|5.0|Hands down, Oldboy is one of the best revenge flicks ever. If you don't watch this then you're missing out on a epic movie.<br />But, I do know idiots who can't watch movies with subtitles because it's too distracting for them, so I'm sure they will<br />go see the re-make of Oldboy that Spike Lee is making, and I vow never to watch that. Trust me people, if you are planning on going to see Spike's version of this, save your $10 for a movie ticket, and just buy this movie. Josh Brolin even asked Chan-wook Park for his blessing on making the new movie, and Chan-wook Park told him to pound sand pretty much.<br />WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!
B00003Q438|5.0|excellent. breathtaking. no futher comments. its one of my all time favorits. I love watching movies that involve water and underwater.
B005ER6STG|5.0|I watched this movie the day it came out, and I was blown away. I'm a huge horror movie buff, out of the thousands of DVDs/Blu-rays that I own, most of them are horror films.<br />It was so nice to watch a horror movie that was extremely original, it wasn't filled with this CGI garbage like every single horror movie that's popular right now is. If you have a week stomach, you probably shouldn't watch it. But if you're a horror movie buff like me, this movie will blow your mind.<br />Every single thing about it is original, the story line, the acting, even the death scenes are all very original.<br />Also, if you like horror movies where it ends happily and the \\"bad guys\\" get whats coming to them, then you're in for a huge surprise if you watch this.<br />I really would love to buy this movie to check out the special features and stuff, but if Amazon has to sell the version that's cut up and missing important scenes, I won't bother. If anyone else knows where I can buy a true uncut version of this, please let me know.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|The beautiful scenery could not make up for the bad script and acting by some of the stars. Too bad.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|Not a very nice subject but one which compels you to go on. There are two people in this story and both have a very steep learning curve to climb. A book which will make you laugh and make you cry but one that you will never forget.
B008602KQI|5.0|avoided watching this movie for some time but it was really wonderful and a lot better than what I was expecting.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|A mystery that spans nearly sixty years and in doing so gives insight into how fate and a few harsh words can shape ones future. How, despite the many changes in our world, the basic characters of people do not and the final twist is inspiring.<br />A book that will keep you wanting to read the next page while never wanting to reach the last. It should appeal to all who enjoy a satisfying read with a hint of how things were.
B009TZ87I4|5.0|The music is magnificent, however, the tracks are all scrambled which is annoying for those trying to follow the music through and through.  Thanks Sony editor for messing up the track listing.  Other than that, no real issues...
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|Stuck downloading on Kindle Fire HD and can't interrupt it to delete. Very frustrating for this to happen. Don't want it now.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It's habit-forming and addictive. That may, or may not, be a good thing.<br />I don't have any more words for it.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I listen to something every night to go to sleep.  For the best selection of background sounds I always turn to this.  I can choose individual sounds or a pre-mix, such as &quot;playground&quot;.  It has different noises and the different hertz levels to choose from also.  For people with tinnitus this works great to cover up the buzz for awhile, my husband has his favorite mix memorized so that any device can be used, but you only have to put your choices in once because you can save it to favorites.  One of my best apps!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game my husband and I enjoyed trying to figure it out together.  Looking forward to playing additional levels soon!
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|The film had amazing special effects and some interesting plt points but parts of it were simply tedius and even a wonderful actor like Morgan Freeman was not enough to keep my interest.
B001PJ3SLI|4.0|I LOVE THE BLUES! I have been hearing and reading about Shepherd for some time now and had to have this. So much like the early Stevie Ray Vaughn I could not believe my ears.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Liked playing this app. Challenging. Free app download. Levels were tough but fun. My eleven year old enjoyed trying to escape the rooms on each level. Want to play more.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app sucks, it always buffers for 20 minutes then plays for 2 seconds then loses connection, and it will load for three hours and only show one video.
030758660X|3.0|I thought this would have more/better patterns for the genre but it really didn't. There were about 3 that were really cute and fun, but some of the others were dorky. I don't see anybody wearing them though they might make a fun novelty gift.

This charger actually shows progress towards 100%.  It took us some time to figure out it was the charger, as we had heard that some of the cords might have been the cause.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Easy to use, great interface and does what it says it will all for free. Would recommend this app to others.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|The movie was very funny and had good action. The plot was simple but it fit well. I highly recommend this movie.  The characters are great.

B009WUAK2M|4.0|good it was a lot better than expected. lots of action and average storyline. did not exspect much of this one
B0055QYKQO|5.0|It works great. The GIGABYTE GA-990FXA-UD3 AM3+ AMD 990FX SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 It gives me amazingly fast transfer rates over my gigabit LAN to my USB 3 external hard drive.  It was bit more sophisticated than ASUS that I have been using but once I got used to it it was well worth the effort to learn.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book was a great read! Although a bit on the short side, it is packed full of facts I never knew. But it is more than just informative, it is inspirational! (:

B006N0YWGY|4.0|I got shine runner as the free app of the day. I personally won't spend $1.00 on a game like this.  It is an ok game, I just wish that you could see what the market I see going to do.  It would also be nice if you could see who much you played for an item  the last time. Would have given 5 stars if not for that.
0061950726|5.0|This book was so beautifully written, switching between two time periods. The characters were well developed. I love historical fiction and \\"Orphan Train\\" ranks as one of the best books I've read in a while. It remained interesting until the end. I loved the way it ended (which isn't the case with all novel.) I highly recommend this book.

B0083SBMBM|5.0|Loved this movie in the theater and totally enjoyed seeing my own copy at home!  Can't wait for next.  This DVD was in perfect shape and no problems.
B0052REUW0|5.0|If you spend much time on the internet, you'll soon find somebody who thinks things are worse than ever and believes they have &#34;the answer&#34; that will fix things.  Chances are, they are wrong on both counts.  Read this, and you'll probably be glad you are living now rather than at any point in history.<br /><br />Pinker does an excellent job of covering a wide range of topics to explain why we are more peaceful now than in the past, and has the numbers to back up that surprising claim.  This is not dry stuff.  He shows that human history is more horrible than we remember, and just how far we have come in so many respects.<br /><br />He is able to weave history, politics, psychology, and ideas from the Enlightenment into a coherent story of how a multitude of factors built on each other to civilize and pacify the human race.  Understanding what got us to our relatively peaceful present is important - we don't want to abandon those ideas and practices and backslide into violence.<br /><br />I was going to give it 4 starts, because I think he gives to much credit to the &#34;Leviathan&#34; of government and I think he's mis-using the term &#34;anarchy&#34;.  I think we could have developed societies based on laws, impartial court system, etc. without the heavy hand of government.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just projecting our current level of civilization on culture that were decidedly uncivilized.  Maybe they did need to be forced into line, and it's just in the last couple hundred years (after being pacified, civilized, and having learned humanitarian values) that we've reached the point where we can start unwinding the leviathan.
B00BUAEYVK|4.0|Was given as a birthday gift and havenot had a chance to see this myself but will do so with a DVD for our famiy. Timely delivery.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|The download is PG-13, but the DVD is R. Not sure what was cut to get the rating lowered. More creepy than gory.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|This movie is so surprising. The plot is excellent, the filming of the action scenes are terrific.<br />So many scenes are so shocking! The element of surprise is awesome.<br /><br />It's a great movie.
B00A88FLI0|5.0|...and the nice thing about Lego is that builder can follow the instructions, rebuild again and again or get creative and make their own design.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app was very convenient and easy to use. It has more options than I needed! For a free or $0.99 app it works great.
B00E3IZIM0|4.0|Other reviewers have done a great job of describing the giddy joy and visual wonder of 'Pacific Rim,' so I'll merely say I agree with them; it is just gorgeous and the effects are so good it's as if there are no effects in the movie.<br /><br />But I want to add that, given the lack of psychological depth to the characters (done on purpose, as with 'Star Wars' or 'Speed Racer'), I found them and their straightforward stories engaging and at times moving. Idris Elba does fine work here, and the flashback to Rinko Kikuchi's character's childhood was astounding.<br /><br />Another bravura performance by Del Toro and team.
0205632645|5.0|See Title line.<br />I didn't expect a lot from a book from the early 20th century that was edited in the 1950s, but this book was surprisingly succinct while delivering a valuable directory in the use of English word choices and grammar.
B00000IREA|3.0|This movie came out and every young boy wanted to see it. Probably every old man back then also. Get it for a good price if you can.
B0083SBM7Q|4.0|It was sure easier to watch these fight scenes than the ones in the new DC Superman movie - not that fighting is the reason we watch these things... or is it?
1475212607|4.0|I'd already read another self-publishing how-to book, and opened this one with the intent of learning a little more about how to get me to the finish line. Though the book wasn't what I expected, I found its insights very useful and in sync with other self-publishing suggestions and ideas I've read. This is a good thing.<br /><br />Overall, a very handy book. It won't be my self-publishing bible, but it's definitely a keeper and worth the read if you want to round out your research in this area.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very good game for youngsters beginning horse or animal care.  I would like to see water concerns addressed as well.  Food water and care are great aspects to learn for allnkids
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this book, it's got such character in it. I'd never get tired of this book. It's got to be one of the best trilogy yet. All my friends love it and so do I.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|THIS GAME IS AWESOME however...there is a hack for it that is being used by players that is you can google it. DO NOT PURCHASE the tokens...you will discover missing tokens on your game as well as missing points. your credit card and atm is at risk!!!! My husband and I both downloaded the game on different devices. Over night after playing for hours our tokens that you must buy...and points earned as well as challenge points rest to one....on more than one occasion. It has even happened while I was playing. There is nothing we can do about it. You will notice within a few minutes after a weekly challenge starting there will already be leaders on the leaders with 10-25 points with in a few minutes....I see where my missing stuff is going.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really enjoyed this game. Looking forward to more levels. Would appreciate a hint now and then but still was able to get through all the levels without assistance.
B009R659L8|2.0|I've been a huge MHC fan for years so it's upsetting to have to rate this book so low. I was incredibly disappointed with this one. The first thing that annoyed me was the constant repeating of information. Main characters were described almost every chapter and we were reminded repeatedly of the character's relationships to one another. Hannah is Kate's sister . . . we get it! I especially hated how we'd be informed of something in the narrative and then a few characters would restate ALL of that info during dialogue. It was maddening. And having the killer confess to everything through inner dialogue was a major letdown that made no sense to me. I wanted to stop reading this book early on but because MHC has been a favorite of mine for over twenty years, I thought I should at least finish it. I'm sorry but I just didn't enjoy this book the way I've enjoyed her other ones over the years.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|no guidance but you can figure it out with patience.  You really need time to work it out,  not a quick time waster and I do get completely involved and forget my surroundings. don't play while waiting for a bus or train,  you might miss it.
B00BYKIKJS|4.0|Terrific acting, flowing chemistry between all the key characters.  Good messages, keeping activities can lead to bonding and mending of wounds.
0064471837|5.0|A fantasy story about a young woman who has to prevent evil from taking over the world, Sabriel doesn't have the most original storyline. But the world and characters are unique, powerful and delightful and more than make up for this.<br /><br />The concepts of the charter and the bells are two of the most interesting magical systems I've seen in a long time. Sabriel herself is a realistic young woman with whom it's easy to connect: unlike some other books, her motivations are both clear and uncontrived, and she shows a lot of humanity throughout her journey.<br /><br />The book is quite short for a fantasy story of this type and still manages to have a reasonably slow pace. This doesn't bother me personally - in some ways it serves to keep me interested in the characters and what they're doing - but some people may feel like not much is actually happening.<br /><br />Regardless, Sabriel is a book that I can (and have) read again and again, and I highly recommend it to people who enjoy the young adult/fantasy genre.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it! BEST books i read all summer hate how i have to write 20 words.... wish i could just put in my rating so my recommendations would be based on stuff i actually own...
140006922X|5.0|Although I haven't quite finished this book, it has confirmed most of my thoughts on the legend of Jesus of Nazareth.  It is a beautifully written narrative that reads like a suspense novel, you just don't want to put it down.  My only problem is finding quiet time to read it.  I suspect there will be reaction from the Christian community that will not be totally positive and I look forward to reading that commentary.  On another level, as a historian by training, I have learned a lot about the politics of Israel during Roman occupation.  What a strange species we are.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I need to write a review so this will effect my amazon recommendations... kinda hate how i have to do it and you are required to write 20 words... wish i could just hit the stars
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great easy read. Lots of details leaving you wanting more! Unable to put book down, jumped straight into the second book.
0439023513|5.0|Again just writing a review so this will effect my kindle recommendations loved these books though... sorry for not giving much more input
B0014JKJHK|3.0|I really like the style and the none slip and oil resistant bottom, they are a bit stiff and not the most comfortable work shoe.  So I am 50/50 on the purchase.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Stephen King has been a very good friend of mine ever since I read \\"Carrie\\" in 7th grade. I devoured every book he wrote with complete abandon and was too scared to allow on several occasions.<br />I remember Mr. King being asked if he would ever stop writing and his reply was he would stop when his ideas had become redundant and stale. He said, \\" At this stage in my career, I could get my laundry list published!\\".<br />I am  die hard fan, but I think it might be time to look into retirement. \\"Mile 81, which is a pleasant enough read, is almost a mirror image of \\"Of A Buick 8\\". Alien cars that eat people.<br /><br />The premise is exactly the same just twisted around a bit, just enough to hold your attention, but at the same time the avid reader of Mr. King' s books knows it is only a thinly veiled reworking of its predecessor,\\"Of A Buick8\\".<br /><br />The constant reader of Mr.King' s works will enjoy it even though, Mr. King has gotten to the point of publishing his laundry list.<br />I will never stop reading Mr.King' s works because even with though many of his recent works have begun to be mediocre, Stephen King' s mediocre is magnificent compared to other authors of this genre.<br />While not one of Mr. King.s best, it is still a pleasant read if you happen to need something to read at the Doctor's office or waiting in line at the bank.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|This sort of replaces Boston Legal for me. I love the characters. I'm not wild about the language, so I have to watch when little people aren't around.
B000267JQK|4.0|Good,hard hitting rock and roll. Nice to have seether in my rock and roll collection.Kinda like a cross between grunge and heavy metal.
B00DHNBPA6|2.0|This remake doesn't have the charm of the original's and isn't scary. That would be fine if it was funny, like Evil Dead 2, but it isn't and c'mon whats a Evil Dead movie without Bruce Campbell?
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great app for monitoring battery health and status. Graphics show all the necessary information. Times for charge and use are very accurate. Highly recommend this app.
1451695195|5.0|I read Proof of Heaven right when it came out after I saw Dr Alexander on television - I believe it was Soul Sunday on OWN.  Anyway, I couldn't put my Kindle down.  I use his languaging daily when I dowse with my pendulum and speak to SPIRIT/GOD (many names, many labels).  The Core that he speaks about is Heaven, of course (our well-known symbol word for our ultimate reality).  This book is SPOT-ON and really has people from all walks-of-life talking about our eternal life after this physical experience is over.  We live here in the unknown; but, after you leave your body, everything is made known.  Isn't that a wonderful way to look at life.  Make the most of your life and your relationships because your relationships with others and animals, etc. is the most important part of our learning and growing from this incarnational experience.  All the Best to You, Readers!
045122499X|5.0|Again Mr. Follett has brought life to Medieval England.  The intertwining of the lives of young Gwenda, Ralph, Caris and Merthin  is the basis for an intriguing tale.  Yes it is a rather lengthy book but it is one that is so spellbinding and fast paced that you are at the end before you realize it.  Again, the machinations of the political and religious play havoc with the lives of all.  They try to control all aspects of everyone's life  But in the end, they cannot control the plague or the survival instincts of people - whether they are serfs or any enemy on foreign soil.<br />Whether or not you have read &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34;, this is a sequel that can be enjoyed.  Mr. Follett is truly a master of the written word.
1592402038|2.0|I was recommended this book to improve my grammar. I feel like I am more confused after reading it. Its really for people who love grammar and want to be congratulated on how much they know.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|App was easy to load and has kept my kids greatly entertained.  Fun music and great graphics.  Maybe I'll even get a turn to play soon...  ;-)
B00CE03UOC|4.0|It keeps me busy with my hands and brain with enough challenge to make interesting! There are enough different levels to keep different family members entertained.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I really enjoyed the first two. Monckingjay was a little boring at times and ultimately ended rather undramatically. You still need to read it to complete th trilogy. Just try to get it over with.
B003Y6EL5W|5.0|Loved this movie. Over the top violence, gore and a little girl with a serious case of potty mouth. What else could you ask for? Turns the super hero genre on it's head. Half serious, half spoof, 100% AWESOME!!!!!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Who doesn't like Indiana Jones!!! I am so happy to have the complete set in my collection. Fans of Harrison Ford will want this one in their collections!!!
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|Great suspenseful show that always leaves you wanting more. Great actors and story lines. INCREDIBLE!!! Don't think about it, just watch this series.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|enjoyable app. I find myself looking forward to seeing what is next on each level. this game definitely makes me think outside of the box.
B008LXZFH6|1.0|10 minutes of funny stuff crammed into 2 hours of filler gags. Even if you like Will Ferrell - this is a waste.  Go rent Elf.  Zzzzzzzzz
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Very good book! Didn't want to finish it!  Wish I could erase it from my memory and start again !
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I was so excited that Khaled Hosseini finally had written another book. I loved his first two books. This book was quite good but not nearly as good as the first two. The stories were disjointed and hard to follow at times. I felt deeply for the characters in his first two books but not so much in this one.
B00B0U2SFE|5.0|This film certainly stands up on re-watching, and especially after  having seen &#34;Inheritance,&#34; the documentary about  concentration camp director Amon Goeth's guilt-ridden daughter--she was three when he died, but apparently was never able to live down her family history.
B00785P2QC|4.0|So far I like it. I'm at the point where I have to leave a comment to help me in the game. This I Don't mind, but I refuse to post about it on Facebook.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book gave me chills, and thrilled me. I felt a serious pang of distress, agony, and sadness when Katness was yelling at Buttercup about Prim`s death. I cried like a baby.
B008JFUO4U|1.0|This movie was horrible. Tom Cruise must have needed the money. As well as Morgan Freeman. The CGI was terrible.
B005Y8KWNS|4.0|Only used it once but it did the job and was easy to transfer my documents from my kindle to others.The only issue is the kindle front facing camera makes it hard to scan documents properly.other than that it's a good app.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Good special effects fast paced fun movie but forgettable,characters not well built dialog poor acting so so a good time pass
B002N14GPE|4.0|I am a scary movie fanatic, seen them all, usually have them all figured out before the movie is over.....this one was a bit more difficult to figure out. I mean, the girl is whacked out but I didn't know why. Its a recommend on my part, if you like scary movies.....you would enjoy this one, plus for the price they are selling it for you almost can't pass it up!
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Need to pay really close attention but otherwise good movie. The cast was really good with each person they had to play.
B005TKD8ZK|3.0|Good read for some runners. Rather short and includes previous magazine articles, albeit edited. I would not recommend the book as a must read but would recommend checking it out for you may be one of the 'one in ten' (might have been a higher number) loyal readers Haruki is content with.
B005LCYR7Y|4.0|A big part of me bought this book because I was curious to see how Stephen King would manage to pull off this challenging storyline.  As always, he delivers and manages to create a story that draws the reader in and strings them along till the end.  Its an enjoyable and riveting read that doesnt disappoint.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|This is a must have if you are a true fan!  Quality is good and the concert itself has a good mix of all their collection.  Young Bonham does his father proud on the drums.
B001V7SME2|5.0|I love this movie! It's the original Swedish film upon which was based the American wide-release &#34;Let Me In&#34;. Twelve year old Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) is a shy weakling who lives in a small apartment building with his divorced mom in the winter of 1981. Soon, a mysterious, pale 12 year old cutie named Eli (Lena Leandersson) moves in next door. They initially aren't friends because they're both loners and, besides, she &#34;smells funny.&#34; It soon becomes clear that Eli's &#34;father's&#34; main purpose is to kill people and bring her fresh blood. Eli is a vampire! But Eli hates living on blood and yearns for normalcy. She becomes increasingly attached to the lovable Oskar, and becomes his unobserved protector...which is great because three bullies at Oskar's high school seem intent upon imparting serious injury to him. Will Oskar discover Eli's secret? What will happen between them? Will Eli get caught? This action-packed movie is more than a horror story. It's a love story: a movie that sneaks into your heart and you'll never forget!
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This is a really good book.  If you are a fan of Stephen King books, I think you will like the Pines series.
B0031Q0XCA|2.0|This is a movie about two people NOT in love. Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a credible job of playing Tom Hansen, a dude in love with Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel). Tom's a trained architect but makes a living writing greeting cards. Summer doesn't believe in love and eventually breaks up with Tom, who is heartbroken beyond repair for a while. He pulls himself up by his oxford shoe laces, quits his card writing job, and becomes an architect. Summer bumps into Tom one day and invites him to a party. Upon arrival, his hopes are dashed because Summer is with another man and wearing an engagement ring. Tom and Summer meet one last time, where she tells him she loves the man she's going to marry--he makes her feel things Tom never did--and they part amicably. The movie ends on an up note, when Tom meets the beautiful Autumn (Minka Kelly), someone with whom he has much more in common. This movie made $63 million over its $7 million budget.
B00A0A59IS|5.0|I heard 1D songs on the radio and thought they were nice but after visiting with my younger sister, who played their music nonstop, I have to say, I don't think I gave these boys a fair shake. Most of their songs are on the cheerier, even cliche side but they're young -- and who can say that those types weren't at least part of their life's soundtrack back when. I like to listen to this album when I want to turn my mood around.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|I like Matthew McConaughey's acting, which drew me to this film...and, man, am I glad I watched it! This might be his finest work to-date. He plays a down-to-earth backwoods character named Mud who's hiding from (a) the law, (b) bounty hunters, and (c) a rich father & his hired goons, intent on payback for Mud's murder of his woman-beating son. Two teen boys find the personable Mud living in a boat in a tree on a deserted island, grow to like him, and decide to help him reunite with Mud's lifelong love, Juniper (Reese Witherspoon). The boys beg, borrow and steal enough items to get the boat out of the tree and seaworthy again...then the drama kicks into high gear! Juniper dumps Mud (again), bounty hunters try to nab him, and the angry father's goons close in. There's snake bites, gun shots, broken hearts, and good-versus-evil enough for even a diehard fan! Mud will be a classic!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|THIS IS THE IDEAL MARRIAGE IN THE END. IT JUST TOOK A LITTLE WHILE AND QUITE A BIT OF DRAMA. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE MOVIE!!!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I miss having a horse, this game is a nice reminder of what it was like to train and complete, brings back good memories
0307719774|5.0|I received this book about 3 months ago, and have been writing down notes every single day. Some questions are casual, such as what's the last movie you watch? Some are more serious, such as what makes you tick?<br /><br />I you like writing journals but have no time for it, I think you will find this book very fun to have.
B004Q9T4E4|4.0|Niall Ferguson at his best. Easy to read and succinct,it is more like a thriller than a pedantic history book.Definitely worth a read
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|It had some entertaining parts but lacked cohesiveness and flow. I would have been upset if I went to a theater and wasted my money on it, but it is a fine rental.
0061733199|5.0|I wanted a survival book to keep in my bag when I travel.  Although I haven't had a real need for it the reviews on it were great which is why I picked this one.  Good size, plenty of illustrations. Pages are sturdy.  Pretty sure this is the best one out there.
1594746036|4.0|This is a great read. It'll have you sitting on the edge of your seat at some points! Can't wait for the next one!
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|J. Cole is the truth. This album is solid - from beginning to end. His production and lyrics are on point.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|This bluray edition is LOADED with features, definitely worth the bucks. Not a big fan of the 3D conversion, although on home ACTIVE 3D televisions it's quite watchable.
B00338QENI|4.0|I liked this book. It is so interesting to know that she is still such a huge part of our world and where we're heading, healthwise.
B00AZ7V0W0|5.0|Was waiting a WHILE for this one to release. Very happy I can ditch my old dvds and upgrade to this collection, the BEST possible master of this film and it converted great to digital blu.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Good Movie.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes action movies and some of these old stars.<br />BK
B005LAII8K|5.0|One of the best films of the year. I usually buy blur-rays for the features but this lacked a lot. Image transfer was perfect and clean. Sound was great as well!
1452101248|5.0|While waiting with my husband at SFO for the Airport Express (bus) to take us home, we struck up a conversation with another couple, exchanging stories of our just completed travels. During the course of our conversation, the woman told me about this book, and by the way she described it, I told her I would order it from Amazon when I got home...which I did.<br /><br />The recipes in this book are wonderfully innovative and delicious! They're all vegetarian by the way, and the book is organized by vegetable. I would prefer it be organized by category of dish, but there is really nothing that could change my enchantment with Yotam Ottolenghi's recipes. Almost every recipe includes a beautiful photo of the dish, and each recipe has a brief description of the dish below it's title.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this book!
B00CE3IC74|5.0|Works great. I used this all the time and it support the latest version of phones.<br />The quality of the chips are good so far no complaints
B00BHMETKC|4.0|4 stars because it was an excellent film, original story.  However, it wasn't the most exciting film. Nevertheless, it's history and that's cool.
B00E8TVHBA|4.0|Personally I don't like this movie but it makes two of my nieces, Ava and Bella, happy. They know all the songs, all the lyrics, and all the dance moves.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Once again the Android is a great user friendly versatile product than apple will ever be. Thanks for the reader.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This is the most greatest game ever it is a real blast.  I never played something that's so much fun.
B0077EBWVI|3.0|Dancing was great. Good acting with very seasoned actors, however not much of a plot.  Probably more suitable for teens.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|i like this game so far. dont have to spend money as long as you are patient. i would recommend
B00EKJWS1Q|1.0|Just downloaded and then removed it (Kindle Fire); trying to get my school emails forwarded to my Kindle for a bigger view.  Going to see if my emails will arrive via the traditional method.  Last time I was unsuccessful.
0446554995|5.0|I could see where the book might confuse some people, but in addition to the central story, there are a obviously a lot of things being set up for later, plus, some of the parallel stories going on really do make sense in the grand schemes of things regardless.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|The only thing I don't like about this book is that it's too short. It's perfect ground for series of stories surrounding the hempstock women. Loved it.
B00633W614|5.0|It keeps you hooked and happy there is a third book. You don't want the saga to end.<br />I'd never read any of Jeffrey Archers books before. I look forward to reading more.
B0007939NO|5.0|This is a great old musical.  Our school is doing it this fall and the students will be watching this to get an idea of what to do on stage.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a series that just leaves me begging for more. I can't help myself from going back in to past seasons to relive a fond memory!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I loved watching this dvd.  If you liked The Phantom of the Opera on Broadway, then you would really like this movie.  This movie is really very different than the 2004 The Phantom of the Opera movie, in the fact that this movie is a copy of what was filmed live and an actual full production.  Most anniversary's were a concert performance with the actors and actresses standing in front of microphone's, were as this anniversary production was actually a full production of this amazing musical.  Also, fans of the original cast of Love Never Dies like Sierra Boggess and Ramin Karimloo, would also like this movie since they star as Christine Daae and The Phantom in this movie.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|The graphics look good and so does each items detail.  I like role play games and this one is for a righteous cause.  Green peace, save the planet!!!
B008602KQI|5.0|...not as good as the book, but well done.<br />Read the trilogy and looking forward to next movie.<br />Would recommend to any one.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Enjoyed the short stories and the cunning of Sherlock Holmes. Recommend it to all who like intrigue and shrewd solutions.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love uno its fun it good for kids u dont get bored of it I love uni so much I want other people to love this app too!!!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Very well written,  I loved each character. Jojo Moyes is a gifted storyteller. I'll look forward to reading her other books. I knew someone long ago who unfortunately suffered the same fate. He also made the decision to end his life with an assisted suicide. He suffered a much longer period of time from what I understand as I was no longer in touch with him. My heart goes out to his family & friends for all their suffering & devotion. Rest in peace Buddy!
B009EHDU7U|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  It was a lovely, warm, humorous  insight into the person, his adventures and the human condition. Reminded me of Goodnight and Loving by Leslie Thomas
1481207474|5.0|I liked it very much, especially the characters and the last seventy/eighty pages, they are splendid.<br />In the first part we find nice and entertaining moments but there are others which mostly fill the plot, mind you, they aren't boring but neither amazing. I must say though that with the second part the recovery is surprising.<br /><br />For those who haven't already read the first novel of The Brothers Sinister (The governess affair), aka the prequel to all the series stories, everything revolves around the Duke of Clermont.<br /><br />In The duchess war (settled almost thirty years later the events of The governess affair) the title has been inherited by the only Duke's legitimate son, Robert, who unlike his father, is good, gentile, altruistic and lacking of any kind of malice in his blood; is life, since he was a boy, has been totally devoid of affection from both his parents: his father, not particularly smart, spendthrift and mean, married Robert's mother to restore his financial problems but when his father-in-law refused to keep paying for the Duke's bad behaviours which only made her daughter miserable, Clermont started to blackmail her wife, using their own son in exchange for more money. Unfortunately the extortion made the Duchess cold and detached towards her son, leaving him at his father's mercy.<br />Robert grows up in loneliness...until one day at school he meets the one person who will become the most important for him: his stepbrother Oliver Marshall, born from his father's violence towards a governess, Serena (The governess affair).<br /><br />I love Robert, he's sooo sweet. When he's with Minni is clumsy and sometimes ironically inappropriate. He is extremely devoted and protective, he wants Minni's love but doesn't know how to let her know. I liked Oliver and Sebastian too.<br /><br />I was happy about how Robert and her mother succeed to overcome their sorrows and to go on as well as they can. In the same way, maybe more, I really appreciate that finally Robert and Susanna (Oliver's mother) can understand and talk with one another almost as a family.<br /><br />I adored, truly adored, the scene in which Robert declares his love for Minni with the alphabet letters.<br /><br />Just in case, her name isn't actually Wilhelmina Pursling but Minerva Lane, she changed it because of her secret.<br /><br />TO READ THE COMLETE REVIEW: http://ilprofumodellepergamene.blogspot.it/2013/08/review-duchess-war-brothers-sinister.html#more  :D :D
B0051GY0LS|5.0|An entertaining book for teenagers in  typical John Grisham style, also enjoyed by older adults.  Recommend the Theodore Boone series.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|The game is fine, but to get coins you need to buy them and there are way too many ads!! Trying to close out of them will only take you to their page!! very annoying!!
B000JMKQX0|2.0|I made myself read to the end, hoping it would develop into something.  It never did and I regret starting it.
B009AMANBA|4.0|very political. I thought this kind of<br />political wheeler-dealer stuff only went<br />on today. Live and learn. See what<br />Lincoln had to do to save the Union.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|The movie was disappointing due to the script.I was pleased with the performance of the actors..I would rate it a 3. rating on the scale 1 to 5.
B00CW7KK9K|2.0|Seems like a good idea, needs a better battery, among other things.  24 hours seems the most without a charge.  Ran out in sleep mode at 3am this morning.<br /><br />Also the sleep mode needs work or a better explanation.  I forgot to shut it off the other morning and it laid on my desk for 2 hours.  Those 2 hours showed up a light sleep.  I guess the Pulse measures the wood as well as my arm.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft dont buy those other apps that try to top minecraft buy the original the best of them all ! Definitely five stars
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|There has been a couple times that it froze on me but i can still enjoy this fast paced game! There is so much going on that you can never really get tired of it or be bored. I just wish they add another level where you can actually get to run in the mall. Now that would be fun, crashing through the different shops would be epic!
B00CW7KK9K|1.0|I bought this in high hopes it would rock and I could pair it with my Withings scale (which does rock).  I also have a fitbit flex and wanted to see how they compare.<br /><br />Findings:<br />1. superforgettable on clothing.<br />2. shows fewer steps than fitbit<br />3. drains my S4 battery.<br /><br />I've resorted to keeping it with a charge in case I head into the backwoods and want to get some vertical info.  Otherwise I'm sticking to my flex.

B00338QENI|5.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is the detailed account of one of medicine's greatest achievements and most awkward dilemmas: the growth of the first &#34;immortal&#34; line of human cells and the acquisition of those cells from a poor black woman without her consent.  More than that, however, the book is an examination of the vast, complex history of conflict between African Americans and the medical system, an exploration of uncomfortable ethics and the effect of uninformed consent on research and the patients.  Finally, the book is an intensely human narrative, the story of mother who unknowingly left her children a massive legacy of medical miracles and a pervading sense of violation and injustice, and the story of an inquisitive and eloquent reporter who was determined to ferret out the truth and ended up gaining a new understanding of race, religion, and friendship.<br /><br />Fascinating, well-written, informative, and personal, this book raises important questions and presents a new take on old issues while giving credit to a long-forgotten medical legend.  I couldn't put it down.

B002JVWR4A|5.0|The Bones series is always interesting as the premise is really good and the actors seem to enjoy each other.  Hey, Season Eight is out and Sesaon Nine has been approved.  Will Season Ten round up the series and make everyone happy ?

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Thoroughly engrossing story.  Juliette is a strong and smart heroine. I have been recommending Silo Saga to everyone. I only read 3 or 4 books a year so if the book isn't worth my time I can't be bothered to read on. This was a rare find.

B002MCYWHG|5.0|My child is tall for her age but still under the weight limit for most carriers. We tried several before choosing this one to stay on the bikes. Her knees do not hit the handlebars and she is comfortable and very happy in front, she hated back seats. This model is installed on a beach cruiser type bike
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I liked this movie. The story was interesting, and the acting was OK. Tom is tom in every movie, but that is OK. I might have been a little disappointed at movie theatre, but it was a good rental.
B00AL8F5EM|4.0|Bourgogne takes an increasingly frequent situation - bilingualism and dual-nationality (and language!) households - and provides a series of practical steps, supported by stories and experiences (and other studies and data!) to help families explore the path of bilingualism.<br /><br />While Bourgogne's experiences have been successful, she acknowledges the struggles and evaluations she has had to make during the upbringing of her children in order to ensure that they get the background she and her husband want them to have. This is very helpful as it addresses practical concerns and provides at least one solution: what worked for their household.<br /><br />Between the practical advice and general information provided, this is a stand-out in the field for practical bilingual upbringing. I would have liked to see a little more information/tips on upbringing and suggestions for third country options, such as I'm in (husband and I share one language, however we're neither native speakers of the majority language in our current country); expat kids and global nomads are an increasing category who, I suppose, are trickier to address than the standard situation of two-language parent units.
B008X8RSTM|4.0|This free app is good. The upgrade is definitely worth the price.<br />Nice clear easy to read. The WIKI feature is the icing on the cake.

B0084B1T8Y|5.0|Great book to have in the library for kids or arguments around dinner table. Classics will stay classics, no matter of further understanding of cultures that surrounded the original writting.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|A lot of people say they can't hear a consistent theme throughout this album.  The overarching theme is THE reason I bought this album.  So much detail and layering.  Hans is a master at mixing huge powerful drums and soft electronic elements that add a lot of power and color.  Awesome textures.  Great album and fantastic movie!
B00DIJ49UW|5.0|Those of you familiar with Ramin Djawadi's work on the first IRON MAN film will likewise enjoy this soundtrack. You can hear the calibrated percussions of the Yaegers slamming Kaijus and the flow of the strings and horns.
B0090SI4LU|4.0|As many might know, this movie was based on the novel written by Stephenie Meyer. While I have some mixed feelings regarding the movie adaptation, for the most part, I have a favorable outlook on the movie as a whole.<br /><br />PROS:<br />1) Casting - I felt like the casting was superb.  Ronan did an excellent job of portraying an alien trapped in a human host.  I sensed the same kind of \\"spunk\\" in Melanie through her voice-overs as I did in the novel.  Some might say that she sounded like a brat, but let's be real here... if their body got taken over by some alien after spending years evading the aliens and trying to protect your loved ones, wouldn't you be a p!ssed off too? :-) Ronan's acting also told the story of how conflicted Wanda had become after taking over her host's body.  Uncle Jeb, Maggie, Ian and Jared were also cast well.  If you compare the novel's descriptions to the movie, some of the characters were changed slightly, but I found that the changes were for the better.  The Seeker, Wanda's new host body, and a few others were described differently, but I didn't think that took away from the movie.<br /><br />2) I liked the movie structure.  While most of it was seen from Wanda's POV, there were some cut-overs to show what the Seeker and some of the other cave dwellers were doing to keep the story flowing.  In a book, it's easy to figure out what's going on based on reading Wanda's thoughts and reactions to things. It is my belief that it would have been a very boring movie if they kept the entire thing in her perspective, so I liked that there were some cut-overs.<br /><br />3) Overall concept - I feel like the overall concept was executed very well even if there were some modifications from the book.  Even though there changes, I think a viewer could easily understand and appreciate the story even if they hadn't read the book.<br /><br />THINGS I THINK COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER:<br />1) I saw the movie prior to reading the novel, and after reading thenovel, I understood much more why Wanda did not want to live.  Obviously, condensing a 600+ page book into a 2ish hour movie is a daunting task.  Wanda's background and reasons for not having \\"children\\" (in an alien sense) were not revealed in the movie.  I think it also would have helped if they had did more to develop how her presence in the cave had continued to cause a divide between the cave population, the friendships she developed with a few of the dwellers and how she felt after some of her only allies had perished really affected her character.  I would have liked to see that explored more.<br /><br />Overall,  I really liked the movie!
B00BOXZAG6|5.0|I don't want to give away too many details and spoil this movie for anyone. It is a love story about two people from literally different worlds and everything is going against them which is why you want them to beat the odds. This is the kind of story I have not seen since leaving Europe in the 1980's but it is great that they're still being made and released. This is a good date movie. Especially if she's European.
B007SGM084|5.0|EL James really delivers a steamy 3 parts novel. Strictly meant for adults as the language is very descriptive and at times erotic.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I like the different places they travel to see.  I like the extravagant things that he owns.  Sexually, things are stated with too much details. I don't like the way he is always subduing her.  She never subdues him.  Overall, I love Fifty Shades.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I am just as entranced with this series as when i first started. I love how this book starts off with half the characters and then picks back up with the rest of them. Can't wait for the next one!
1465408746|5.0|Beautiful, crisp drawings and more material than you can shake a stick at - I've read a lot of the Star Wars technical manuals, and I've collected them for years, but none are more beloved to me than cross sections novels.  The amount of detail is staggering - I wouldn't be surprised if these were used as reference for the films sometime in the future.<br /><br />I'd love to see Expanded Universe vehicles next - there are so many cool vehicles I'd love to see!
B00000251N|5.0|One of my all time favorites. I Somehow lost my original CD. Even after listening to this for many hundreds of times, I still listen to this CD at least every week.
B00CKYHH6O|5.0|I've loved Star Trek for years, and I've been progressively more impressed with these restorations. It's incredible how much the show matures over it's seasons - particularly in episodes written by Ronald D. Moore - it's clear he's a man that knows story!  The character development went much deeper, and in some of the episodes, the heavy handed hamminess that'd been present no longer appears. All in all, an excellent show I'd suggest to any sci fi fan.
B000002LOE|4.0|Losing My Religion is one of my favorites from this CD and worth the price even if some of the other songs had been left off.
0812550706|3.0|Shipping was super fast although the print is so darn small.  My granddaughter said she had a hard time reading it.  That said, you get what you pay for.  We just needed it for a school project so it served its purpose.
B00CSSS2V6|2.0|Despite the remastering, the album never catches the excitement of a stadium rock act. Instead, view/listen to some of the concerts McCartney has released over the past 10 years. You'll enjoy his new line-up of musicians that greatly compliment McCartney's vast library of songs. There is definitely more volume, energy and polish. As he is one of the hottest acts touring in 2013, expect a new compilation of music and videos that should be very satisfying.
0385737955|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Well written, fascinating concept, lots of action and humor. Cannot wait to read the rest of the trilogy
B00DAMO7MM|5.0|Mavis Staples is a testament to graceful aging and the thought that you are never too old to make new memories. If you like soulful music that has a rock tinge, this album will make you smile. You'll definitely play it several times, wait a few days and listen again.
B00CRMWMZ0|4.0|I wasn't sure I would like the latest Daft Punk offering when I listened to the samples on Amazon.  I was thinking they would build on the style of the Tron sndrk.  However, most of the tracks really grew on me once I heard the whole song.  My faves: The Game of Love, Instant Crush (kind of pop sounding-could see this single released if it isn't already), Lose Yourself to Dance (awesome), Doin' it Right (my personal favorite), and Contact.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Unfortunately they don't tell you ahead of time that your router needs to have UPnP capability.  I have FIOS and the wireless router they provide does not have any options to enable/disable UPnP.  Get error message right from the start that my WiFi is not on.  My WiFi is on 24/7.  Check your router options and settings before purchasing this item.  Also, Google tech support person was one of the rudest people I've ever spoken to over the phone.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|fantastic first season forone of the best shows ever made.  Cranston is amazing as Walt - the seeds are planted here for him to begin his journey to Heisenberg.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|What I like about the series:<br /><br />The characters, even minor characters, were fleshed out and made human in some way or another by having at least one personality trait described. The people were real, not just props or shells the way the author described them.<br /><br />The politics were well described. Nearly every type of political system conceivable existed in one way or the other in Panem, either officially or unofficially, from the North Korea style presidential dictatorship with caste system of the overall nation, to the surprisingly benevolent fascist communism of District 13, the ancient Egyptian style prison/slave state of District 11, to the Libertarian interaction in the Hob. Positive and negative effects of everything were described without going into the detail of unnecessarily pointing out the obvious most of the time.<br /><br />There wasn't any sugar coating. I feel that the author made an effort to not cross any lines that would keep this from qualifying as a teen book, but at the same time it was gritty, emotional, and everyone suffered, just like real life and complex subjects were addressed.  There weren't a lot of loose ends, the author did a good job of tying those up.  She credited her husband with pushing her towards that in the authors notes at the end.<br /><br />The sheer popularity of this series did catch my attention a little, but I'm not exactly a follow the popular trends type. Then the first movie was on Amazon Prime, free for my viewing so I watched it with my parents, and we all liked it. I had already bought this books series for my fiance's Kindle so I had something I thought she would like on there when I gave it to her for Christmas. She had already read them, but having them on my account made them that much more tempting.  Finally after nine months of sitting there untouched I cracked it open and started reading.  I pushed through rather rapidly.<br /><br />I'm debating rather I should go ahead and send this over to my daughter's Kindle or not. She's 10 (and don't allow her archive access), it's a little above her level, but then again I read Robert R. McCammon's the Wolf's Hour at 12 and Swan Song soon after. Much heavier and more adult targeted than these. I doubt she would actually read them for at least a year at minimum if I did send them to her Kindle, if ever, but still not sure yet. The complexity of the whole games/political system, which is important, is beyond her at this age, but it would be a good introduction to the concepts.<br /><br />The only thing that was a put off to me was the love triangle, confused emotional girl aspect. It drove the story, I think it was simply the female perspective from a female author that made it girly, even if it was in a tomboyish way.  I have a problem with indecisivness and Katniss had that in spades.  It doesn't really detract from the books, but it's the only thing that was sort of a put-off to a 35 year old man who typically doesn't read teen lit, and hasn't since my pre-teen years having moved to McCammon and Stephen King immediately after reading the Chronicles of Narnia which where age appropriate to me at the time. May not annoy anyone else, and I recognize it was my built in &#34;anti-chick flick&#34; circuit getting activated on occasion, even if it was a book series and not movies.  I highly recommend this series.  I started reading this expecting watered down imagination land touchy feely teen goop, and was pleasently surprised by the depth.  Even if you are an adult male in the 30+ category that reads Chrichton and Grisham I recommend it.my daughter's Kindle or not.

B000NJVWU0|5.0|This has always been my favorite Alan Parson's Project album. Whether I could tell by listening, or picked up the idea somewhere else: the songs on the album are about a 'battle of the sexes'. The songs are more 'about women', in that only two songs on the album are from a woman's perspective. Pretty much on Eve, it would seem the men sing the men's songs and the women sing the womens'<br /><br />I can identify with all of the songs, except perhaps for the final song, and perhaps the best song on the album 'If I Could Change Your Mind' sung by Lesley Duncan. Both the song 'If I Could Change Your Mind' and the song 'You Won't be There' seem to be in need of the same lyric, 'castles in the air'. The lyric to 'If I Could Change Your Mind' is, \\"At the risk of losing only castles in the air, come with me and we can try again\\". The lyric to 'You Won't be There' is \\"Why must you leave me? Why are you going anywhere? Why must our love be something in the air\\"? 'Something in the air' could easily be 'castles in the air' again, and it might, in fact, make more sense this way, but the band decides not to use the same lyric twice, apparently. More of the lyrics to 'If I Could Change Your Mind'.<br /><br />If you should change your mind<br />If I could let you see what lies behind<br />If you could still see me the way it used to be<br /><br />Even for the moment of the happy times we shared<br />Living in my dreams since then<br />At the risk of losing only castles in the air<br />Come with me and we can try again<br />Oh, if I could change your mind<br /><br />Can't pretend it's been lonely since you went away<br />Oh, if I could change your mind.<br /><br />The most moving song, to me, (it's an inspirational song) is 'Reach Out' sung by Clare Torry. Clare Torry is the one who sings to 'That Great Gig in the Sky' by Pink Floyd. Only at one point do the lyrics \\"Don't allow the world of men to turn your head no more\\" specifically reference a woman's point of view. It's a very good song. I can't help but notice the women on the cover of Eve are dressed in Veils, as if attending a funeral. There's really nothing on the album connecting it to this funeral theme, except, perhaps, the lyrics to the song 'Reach Out'. I can't help but tie the lyrics to the song, to the photo on the album cover. In my mind, anyway, they may be connected. More lyrics to 'Reach Out' are below. Why not? It's a beautiful song.<br /><br />Don't rely on miracles<br />To open any door<br />And don't you let a shadow<br />Be your guide anymore<br /><br />Don't hold back, don't hold back<br />Don't hold back, reach out<br />Touch the sky with your mind's eye<br />Don't be afraid to reach out<br /><br />Ride the wave of destiny<br />Rise above the crest<br />And believe everything that happens<br />To you happens for the best<br /><br />Don't allow the world of men<br />To turn your head no more<br /> 'Cause if you can't let yourself go<br />What are you saving yourself for'?<br /><br />Don't hold back, don't hold back<br />Don't hold back, reach out<br />Touch the sky with your mind's eye<br />Don't be afraid to reach out<br /><br />Don't you let your fantasies<br />Be blinded by the light<br />You don't have to save your<br />Wildest dreams for the night<br /><br />Don't hold back, don't hold back<br />Don't hold back, reach out<br />Touch the sky with your mind's eye<br />Don't be afraid to reach outod song.

B002MFX0RQ|5.0|My husband and I were fortunate enough to grow up watching this man's movies. He is amazing! He is just so believable when he is reacting to this invisible rabbit and the supporting actors are marvelous. There will never be another James Stewart, he was one of a kind.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|I can understand why some people dislike The Tree of Life.  It is not a conventional film.  It's more like a feeling, memory . . . deep thinking put into the format of a movie (accompanied by beautiful music).  There is much less of the plot and conventional story telling than we typically see in movies.<br /><br />But it does tell a beautiful story, and it's one of my all-time favorite films.<br /><br />I wouldn't begrudge anyone who turns it off, falls asleep, or just plain old dislikes it; but at least give it a chance.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|The little battery in the corner of my kindle fire stopped moving so I couldn't tell if my battery was charging or not. I downloaded this app, and it lets me know when it is charged.

B009NY43NY|2.0|I have read and enjoyed each Sookie Stackhouse book at least three times.  A series is hard to end...This book is, indeed, like watching the Titanic sink.  If you have read all or most of the series, then this book is necessary.  But I recommend that you borrow it from the library.<br /><br />The writing  feels rushed.  The plot isn't bad, just &#34;terminal.&#34;  Many loose ends have to be refreshed and then tidied up.  As a fan, I say this book is necessary but hardly sufficient.  I am not sorry I read it, but I won't read it again.  But I will be revisiting all the other books.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I watched 2 episodes of the current season while on a business trip on the CBS application and have become addicted to the series.  Excellent writers ans actors in this one and am glad it is on Amazon Prime.
B008B8DY2O|5.0|I read this book on a recommendation of a friend after I had been to India. It honestly describes some of the conditions that I encountered in India and would recommend any one who is not too squeamish to read it with an open mind.
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|Kanye's best album to date, an album that demands you listen to it from beginning to end. Kanye's strong point has never been with his lyricism, but he puts his best on this album and that's good enough considering the amount of effort put into the production of this album. I find Kanye enjoyable because he indulges in his instincts and isn't trying to paint himself as a saint. Kanye even points it out at times that he knows what he does isn't right, so it makes it enjoyable to hear the various sounds and instruments compliment the mood and paint an image that illustrates his emotions. It is authentic and real when he shows his frustrations and flaws throughout the album which is why I can connect to his music. It's not terribly deep or revolutionary, but it's enjoyable and a pleasure to listen to from beginning to end.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I like the story and the development of the characters. Keeps me coming back for more. The picture quality was crisp and clear.

B005VPRG10|5.0|I saw the Tie Fighter in stores and online and thought it didn't look very interesting or fun to play with so I never got it. But I wanted more ships to play with with my kids so I finally ordered it and it turned out to be one of my favorites.<br /><br />It's very sturdy and well designed. My 4 year old, who is constantly breaking the other ships, can play with this one and I don't have to worry about him being too rough with it.
140006922X|4.0|I'll admit that I learned of this book after seeing video clips of the infamous Fox news interview with author Reza Aslan, who comported himself so well in the face obnoxious ignorance. The book is meticulously researched, and generally quite readable. If you are interested in learning more about the historical context of Jesus' times, and are not seeking affirmation of your Christian beliefs, this is an excellent read. I am skeptical of a few of Aslan's points, but will resist the urge to delve into these. The point is that his own theses are rooted in solid research, and certainly worth your attention.

We use them on the PC side to connect to the piece of equipment's serial port, and on the equipment's USB ports to test them for functionality. Having both a PC driver and a Linux driver helps a lot here. Also, the product has a real part number and comes consistently the same way every time. \\"The cheapest\\" USB to serial converter may work in a home environment where the end user can use any driver, but we need the consistency of the same product using the same driver every time.

B004GJXQ20|5.0|I obviously saw the series first, but now, while I wait for Season 4, I decided I couldn't wait so long and started reading the books. I loved this book, I think the way it is written makes it easier for you to follow the story and it just leaves you wanting to start book 2 right away!
B006Z7XNVK|2.0|This was a bad movie. Simply bad story telling. The ending simply faded to black. It is not worth anyone's time. There is effort by the actors, but why do they lend their name to this??
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Had to download Facebook on my kindle... It is a must! It works perfectly, and I love seeing everything in a bigger screen than in my phone.
B00CKYIENY|4.0|Well written love story. A lot of old language, so it can be difficult to understand at times. Reading with a Kindle really helps so you can easily look words up.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|Not crazy about the app. I don't like that it doesn't show a lot of what the main page does.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I love musical comedies and this is a movie you'll watch over and over.  It's very entertaining.  This is an extra copy I bought because I know I'm going to wear the first one out.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Fast paced fun and challenging. Highly recommend this if you have a little extra time on your hands and like solving mysteries!
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is a wonderful children's movie but it's also fun for adults.  I laugh all the way through.  There's one part that's particularly funny and every time I see it, I laugh like I did the first time I saw it.  My grandson loves to see me laugh and looks forward to that particular scene.  Very entertaining!!!
B000YDAYK4|5.0|本来我不帅的，但是我穿上了这双鞋，我瞬间就帅了，变成高富帅<br />I did not handsome, but I put on these shoes, I instantly handsome,  become rich handsome.....Love it<br />I wanna to buy more
0060254920|5.0|I bought this book when my children were young and they loved it.  We'd moved and I don't know what happened to the old book, but I had to buy a new one when my grandson was born.  He loves it, too.
B005LHO274|5.0|Cannot wait to take this out on a clear night and try it out. Must go to the country to exercise it.
0143035711|5.0|Thanks for the new book, my old one was falling apart and this one is in great condition - like new
B008J05EL8|5.0|While this is not as extensive as I would like, it is adequate to the basic task of choosing fonts. Worthwhile having.
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|Great film!, I like that it was kept clean but kept your focus<br />Glad they kept it close to what was in the book too :-)
B008I43DYU|5.0|Any time numbers must be manipulated, even in a rudimentary sense, one should have one of these. Get it now.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Who doesn't love Tina Fey? Well, get  ready to love her more after reading this wonderful book. Fey pulls back the curtain on her life and lets us all peak in. A great read.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|Not a Nikon SLR, but it does have a niche. Personally would rather have a regular digital. Gotta save my money.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I hardly watch television because I have very little free time and also because there's so much garbage on most of the time. I kept reading the reviews about Downton and was curious but never took the time to watch until my husband said that he had been hearing about it and it sounded like something I'd like. I absolutely love the characters the costumes and the beautiful scenery. I am addicted!!!
0142429104|4.0|This is a fascinating meeting of cultural boundaries.  I think we could all learn something.  To push is not bad just make sure it's the right direction.
1846041074|3.0|... but a really good chapter on &#34;love&#34;, what it is and what it isn't. reminded me of books on codependency that i read. the rest of the book wasn't worth my time, however.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|But what do you expect when it is set during WW I? The house is amazing, the characters interesting, and the accents enjoyable. All in all, a wonderful series!
B0065FFMR0|5.0|*Note: This show is for Adults Only. There is way too much mature content for kids.*<br /><br />If you like truly horrible things with ghosts and the terrors that mankind can inflict, this is a super show. It's a little addicting and mysterious. The acting and story line are superb. I highly recommend if you like the shivers that go up your spine when something horrible happens right in front of you. This show is truly creepy.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|this is still a great website to buy cds.  If you are not downloading your music and still use a player.
0385523394|5.0|First off I loved Orange is the New Black on Netflix so when I learned it was based on a true story I had to read it. Thank you Piper Kerman for sharing your story. I feel like I know these women! They have become a part of my life. This book it well written and thought provoking, one that I will keep and read again.
0307477479|4.0|The characters in this book were really well written - which turned out to be a problem for me.  The lack of narrative cohesion is something I'm typically not a fan of, but in the face of really great writing and amazing characters it is particularly frustrating.  Call me old fashioned, but I like a story to have some semblance of a beginning, middle and end (I'll even take two out of three).  Another reviewer has referred to the novel as `pointillistic' which is fair.  Each character makes up one speck of color, which up close is almost meaningless yet taken at a wider vantage point presents a more clear picture.<br /><br />Opening with Sasha, the troubled assistant to Bennie Salazar - an aging music producer and fulcrum to many of the connected lives and stories in the book - Egan's skills really go to work.  From the outset, the book is deep and moody - sort of a really bright teenager; pensive, destructive and unpredictable.  The variety in setting and main character explored in each chapter is refreshing, keeps the reader on his/her toes and at times, overwhelming.  Criss-crossing the globe, covering several decades, focusing on characters from teenage girls to the terminally ill -it is all covered.<br /><br />The prose are fantastic, the syntax fun and the vocabulary exquisitely curated.  The pictures painted by Egans words are clear, moving and bracingly human.  Though I had a major issue with this book, it was only one issue (and may just say more about me than the book itself).  The book was a page turner - I speedily flipped through the chapters wanting more.  I look forward to picking up one of her other books and am in awe of her talent.
0062183613|5.0|Implications for the research in this book hit almost every industry.  A MUST READ.  Especially important for educators and business leaders.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This is a classic that everyone should have in their home library. Watching the  special features is a must. Great cast!
B007THA4FI|4.0|Definitely not for anyone under 18.  Her characters are well flushed out, although I can't say I care much for these people; gives humanity a black eye.  I had to keep reading though because I wanted to know how the story ended.  I was torn between 3 and 4 stars but thought it was better than just &#34;ok.&#34;
0061743526|5.0|The fact that this is Harper Lee's only book, AND it is still sold and revered today, says it all.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|The game is supposed to be free. It was free until my sons played it a few times &amp; THEN we could not play anymore unless we paid $1.99. WHAT? Deleted.
B006FE83U4|5.0|Gregory Peck delivers an Atticus Finch like no other man could.  Harper Lee must have been proud when this came out.  Even all these years later both the book and the movie are movie and in their own right:  timeless.  A true masterpiece.
B0063IH60K|4.0|There are certain expectations when it comes to your solitaire game. This one comes through very well.  Basic play when it counts.
0375842209|5.0|I read this as part of a book club meeting and the discussion was lively and interesting,  I would highly recommend this book.
B004OEJMZM|5.0|I implemented a forking container six months ago ([...]  This book was invaluable.  Even though the examples are all in C, the concepts apply to any language when you are writing code to run in a Linux (or any Unix, really) environment.<br /><br />The book is clear, well organized, and comprehensive.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game around...........<br />Fun to play and easy to play for all ages even 3 year olds......My grandson loves the different people........
B003KRLKHC|4.0|It keeps the viewer wondering  about the importance of &#34;the book&#34;.  All comes together at the end. The type of movie that can be watched several times and still view something that was missed on an earlier viewing.  Powerful story!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This game is very challenging and I like how the space theme is incorporated. The graphics are fun and there are many opportunities to try new strategies.

1451695195|5.0|especially adopted children and atheists, it is well written and deeply researhed by a very intelligent man who wants to share his wonderful and very believable journey.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|I wasn't expecting much while going into this movie. But after seeing a commercial for it, I decided to give it a shot. And I'm glad I did. This movie is amazing! The acting (Especially by Ben Affleck and Jeremy Renner) is great, and the story line is awesome, to say the least! This movie is definitely underrated, but it's completely worth the watch!
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I thought this was a very interesting and unique. Well acted and great story line. I'm not usually big on Tom Cruise but this was a good choice for him.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|Season 3 of The Walking Dead can be summed up in 1 word: INCREDIBLE. I've been watching this series since the very first episode, and this season definitely won't disappoint! The acting, especially by Andrew Lincoln (Rick Grimes), the writing, and the plot line from episode to episode is brilliant. I can't wait to see where the next season will go!
1451629184|3.0|It was okay, it certainly was not a brand new book, and I didn't expect a brand new book, so there you go. Prompt delivery!
B002FQOI0A|5.0|Ummmm......... it was a interesting book for me but it was also very good it's a good book to read for fun and for school or anything like that!!!!!!!!

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Just go and get it because it is a fun game. Btw you should watch despicable me 2 because it was a good movie
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love having an alarm that can be set independently for different functions. Have to get up early on Wednesday mornings? Want a soothing alarm to wake you Sunday? You can even have a recording of your own child saying \\"Lazy Daddy, will you get up? (though that will take some work). Starting quietly then getting louder, a quiet alarm that doesn't wake your partner, so many choices. Almost makes me happy to be waked.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Good game so far. I'm really enjoying it. A lot of areas to explore. I will give an update when I've played longer.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I hardly buy any DVD trilogies, but since I'm still kind of going with the DVDs, I have nothing to complain with all the booklets and small extras that were in the set.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|love gaga's return. better than the last album, and that was amazing to start with. buy this song! great one
B009X012XM|3.0|The first thing I noticed upon receiving this was that the color- shown on the website as \\"orange\\" but which appears unquestionably yellow- was delivered as unquestionably orange. The 'orange' appears a very similar yellow to some of the Amazon buttons, but is in fact closer the color of some of the Amazon text. I understand the variance of monitor displays, but the shade of orange is nowhere near what is shown. So that's annoying, but whatever, I won't get hung up on aesthetics when I have less superficial fish to fry.<br /><br />I purchased this case because I wanted something attractive, simple, and light, that wasn't made of animal hide. The unexpected (and undesired) color aside, the case IS lightweight, simple, and of man-made materials, but that's where the appeal ends for me, I'm afraid. The issues I have with it are as follows:<br /><br />1. The strap that's meant to hold it open or closed goes right over the headphone jack, and doesn't keep it terribly secure, as the cover still slides around on the screen.<br /><br />2. The cover flips back and bends to fit into the lip on the back side, enabling you to stand it up at an angle. This is great, except that it places the \\"spine\\" side on the bottom, so if you're utilizing the ports (either for charging or accessing another device), it won't sit flat, but rather rests its weight on your cord.<br /><br />3. Finally, it feels a bit counter-intuitive to me, as I feel like it should open similar to a book. However, the only possible orientation that allows access to the ports essentially orientates the Kindle upside down. So if you want the \\"spine\\" on the left like a book, the power and volume buttons and your headphone jack are on the bottom.<br /><br />All in all I suppose it does what it's meant to, in that it will probably keep your Kindle safe from unusual wear and tear, it provides an option to stand it up, and provides access to the ports while it's closed. I just feel like some of the design choices don'tmake much sense or weren't thought through from a functional perspective. I wish the outer side was open so that I had the option to reverse the Kindle's orientation. For that reason, I wouldn't buy this again, and for my purposes, I wouldn't recommend it.
B004WR125O|5.0|It was a quick and easy install. Enjoy listening to a variety of music. I would highly recommend this product.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is fun and challenging. I really like that I have to really think about it in ordercto pass a level.
B005ZMTXMY|5.0|The life of the couple that takes place over the first 5 or 10 minutes of the film is the most emotional thing I have ever seen animated, and then the rest of the movie settles in to a very amusing and enjoyable story that is fun for all ages.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|This book was clearly well-researched and exquisitely detailed.  The read was a bit tedious at times but, nevertheless, well worth the time spent.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|The best book i have read in a long time.  Glad i read it. Really delivers a fair assessment of Jobs and his history with Apple.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Watched everynight almost all night... love this show! Not sure why I hadn't heard of it previously. A Must See!
B003730LRY|4.0|My daughter and I first saw this movie about ten years ago when she was five. Every single time she has seen it, there have been some breaks of years between viewings, she enjoys it as if it is the first time she had ever seen it. Definitely a very good movie to eat h with your kids
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Although Scandel is my Fav this is a true competitor! The turns and brilliance in the writting is nothing short of GREAT!
0061726834|4.0|Oh boy guys...what to say about Delirium other than \\"read this book!\\"???<br /><br />The concept of love being considered a disease by an entire society was such a unique concept that I was pretty much captivated from the first page. Of course, because this concept is so \\"out there\\" I was being a little over analytic with the logistics of it all. But eventually, I was able to just shut that part of my brain off and dive into this interesting and truly sad concept of a world that Lauren Oliver created. A world without love....can anyone truly imagine it?<br /><br />Lena starts out as a strict rules-follower type of person. She's had too many experiences in the past that haunt her concerning those who try to break the rules--those who fought for love. And after seeing what those people have gone through, the very idea of the \\"disease\\"--the deliria--terrifies Lena. She absolutely cannot wait until she turns eighteen so that she can receive the cure. But genius is not needed to know that Lena has quite a wild ride ahead of her.<br /><br />Initially, I was almost more intrigued by Hana's character than by Lena. Hana is always pushing the edge of what's been deemed appropriate by the government and what her heart calls out to her. Hana and Lena go through a lot throughout the entire story unfolding in Delirium, and I loved how they could be at odds with each other and return back to a place of love and devotion to each other as true friendship allows.<br /><br />Alex confused me at first because he wasn't really what I was expecting. In the end he lived up to be everything I hoped for. He is the catalyst for so much change within Lena and I don't think we've even seen how far the reach of the ripples that he's caused for Lena and even other secondary characters as a result. I can't wait to find out more.<br /><br />After reading a couple of books where I felt like the writing was immature (that's the best word I can think of right now), but having a hard time explaining what I meant by that, Delirium was so easy to pick out as being excellent writing--lyrical and poetic. Beautiful. I actually listened to the audio version of this book, read by Sarah Drew. She did an excellent job. She was dramatic and intense and I felt my heart pounding my chest during certain parts of the book. The intensity that she put behind her narration was just what this book called for. Though sometimes Sarah Drew's narration for Alex was slightly off-putting, the rest of the story and the performance was spot on.<br /><br />Some of my favorite quotes (*note because I listened to this book in audiobook version, it's almost impossible for me to quote directly, specifically punctuation, etc. I did the best I could. And I definitely can't site the location.):<br /><br />\\"You can't really be happy unless you're unhappy sometimes.\\" - Hana<br />\\"The secret to talking to boys--you have to be angry all the time.\\" - Lena<br /><br />\\"Is it possible to flirt without knowing you're flirting?\\" - Lena --YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />\\"And then my eye went full flutter.\\" -Lena - Ok this one you have to know the context, but trust me...it's hilarious, especially if you've ever had an eye twitch due to stress.<br /><br />\\"Apparently the disease turns you into a world class liar.\\" - Lena<br /><br />\\"Without love there could be no hate. Without hate, no violence.\\" - Lena followed up by \\"Hate isn't the most dangerous thing. ...Indifference is.\\" - Alex<br /><br />\\"You have to understand. I am no one special. I am just a single girl. Five feet two inches tall. And I am in between in every way. But I have a secret. You can build walls all the way to the sky and I will find a way to fly above them. You can try to pin me down with a hundred thousand arms, but I will find a way to resist. And there are many of us out there. More than you think. People who refuse to stop believing. People who refuse to come to Earth. People who love in a world without walls. People who love into hate and refusal, against hope, and without fear. I love you. Remember. They cannot take it.\\" - Lena<br /><br />Delirium is a must read in my opinion. Full of beautiful prose, intense pacing, and original in concept. I'm giving Delirium 4.5 Stars. Have you read Delirium? If so, what did you think? Let me know!<br /><br />For more reviews, check out Somewhere Only We Know - [...]ve into hate and refusal, against hope, and without fear.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|Awesome! This app is totally user friendly and allows you to customize everything! Alarm Clock Xtreme is the best alarm ever! It automatically adds a ringtone to the selection once you click 'set as alarm tone' on a different app for ringtones. I highly recommend this app to anyone who seeks a great alarm app!

B00DJWV11I|5.0|Emma Chase has done an amazing job of writing a novel from the point of view of a womanizer.  What makes the story especially appealing, is that it starts with the \\"hero\\" in pain.  In too many romance novel, the male lead character gets to act like a jerk for the whole book and then suddenly having an unexplained change of heart without showing any emotional growth.<br /><br />Drew Evans is a spoiled, rich, successful man who has been able to attract women without any effort.  He meets Katherine Brooks, who is a strong female, and definitely his match.<br /><br />\\"I`m Drew, by the way.\\"  I hold out my hand.  \\"And you are?\\"  She holds up her hand.  \\"Engaged and Undeterred.\\"<br /><br />\\"If the only reason you blew me off is because I work here,\\" I say, \\"I can have my resignation on my father`s desk within the hour.\\"  HA!<br /><br />There are lots of laughs along the way and great steamy scenes.

B00004XQP4|5.0|Some of the songs are a little... similar, to other albums, but this CD still gets me going on a slow morning.  Vocals are flawless, as always.  The last song &#34;Macy's Day Parade&#34; and one of the first songs, &#34;Misery&#34; are actually my favorite songs on the album, not the better known &#34;Warning.&#34; It was a very happy suprise.  I highly reccomend getting this album for a collector.

B009VMN3RA|5.0|This was a good read.  I could hardly put it down.  It's hard to believe that someone as famous as Shirley MacLaine could be such an uncaring parent.  Her father was also a bad parent. Sachi was a child on her own and turned out well with no parenting.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft and I think that this app is really amazing because you can basically build whatever you want! I would really suggest this app to anyone. I don't know anyone who doesn't enjoy playing minecraft
B000QRIGLC|1.0|Reminds me of Into Thin Air. Both books tell a story that justifies the decisions of the only survivor. A fun read but do a little research on the event afterwards to get a balanced view.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I love this because the story was so different.  The author writes with poetic flair and captures your heart throughout the story.

B001XVD2Z0|5.0|This movie is pretty much a classic; if you haven't seen it, you are missing way too many references that appear in other movies. This one started the whole camera-spinning-around-someone-who-is-mid-kick that is quite commonplace now. It's a Sci-Fi Thriller and it's fun.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|In a day w/ gratuitous language and violence for the sake of shock effects, Downton Abbey depicts the life and time in a period of world history that is entertaining, insightful, and creative. It is a refreshing change from redundant reality TV which is no more than voyeurism in film form.
B00CW665VI|3.0|The book is written as a man as the main character. His viewpoint is reflected throughout the entire book so it was a different kind of book than what I was use to. I was left at the end of the book wanting more.

B0081BU42O|4.0|Good Culture novel. Solid writing with an intricate plot and good characters. Not the best book if you haven't already read a Culture novel. If you don't know what that means, go read The Player of Games or The Use of Weapons.
B000JCSPG0|5.0|This was an excellent science fiction tale about the origins of the stargate! the ancient Egyptian \\"aliens\\" were designed amazingly and the locations in the film such as the desert world are beautiful. I really enjoyed the plot of this film where the humans stood up for their freedom and had revolted against the Egyptian aliens. I would definitely recommend this film to all sci-fi fans. For a movie that was first released in 1994 this has aged really well and the special effects still look great even by todays standards.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|It doesn't deserve more than 3 stars. Lacks originality . For a free app it's more than I expected. Hope I won't get bored to soon .

B007THA4FI|1.0|This book was quite a disappointment, keep waiting for it to get better ,but it never did. Boring !  I'd take a refund on this one.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have Evermore installed on my Pc at home and at work, on my Kindle, and on my phone.  I can easily jump from one device to another and continue work that was started elsewhere.  Haven't had any problems syncing or with navigating through the app.  Definitely recommend!

B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Clear , precise love it what can I say..<br />Worth the money.<br /><br />If you are not a fan you will still love it very diverse music..
B0025KVLUG|5.0|an old boyfriend turned me onto the Beatles. I'd bought this for work to listen to on my CD player. Good times, lots of laughs
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|Sucks don't buy has the word morons in it now my kid says it all of the time and my kid called me a moron
B0025KVLRO|5.0|I bought this to listen to on my CD player at work. Everyday at 2:00pm it'd be Beatles time! Everyone LOVED it!!! Thank you very much, Fast delivery too
B00A8ECU24|2.0|My kiddo was so excited as she is obsessed with My Little Pony's, but this seemed more adult or older child orientated, so she really wasn't able to play.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I enjoyed the movie so much! I was drawn to that haunted hillbilly/blues music. Excellent listening. Helped make the day go by faster at work
B002SHD9E2|5.0|I've seen the musical on several big stages.  The movie has the flexibility of interpreting some of the story a bit beyond the play.  I enjoyed their interpretation of the closing scene.  Love the music from this show, these voices did not disappoint.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|This was part of our 2pm Beatles selection! We'd sing and dance to it at work, and laugh! All before Pandora. Sometimes the older ones are better
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My highest score is 540546.this is the best and funest game ever.tell me yours if it is higher then mine.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|This was part of our 2pm ritual- we'd put on a Beatles album, dance , laugh and be silly for a half hour! The rest of the day was a cake walk
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|It was more like porn than a novel. After about one quarter of the book I deleted it from my Kindle. Will never buy a Sylvia Day book again. Wish I could get my money back.
B0025KVLTW|5.0|Part of my &#34;I want it&#34; list for work before Pandora. We'd listen and dance and be silly. Most of us STILL want to be with Paul
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|Knowing family who went through the Great Depression and hearing what they endured lets you feel the hurt and desparation this family had to live.A very well made movie everyone should watch.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|The devotion to family & friends depicted in this beautifully written story is truly a life lesson. I continue to be humbled by the strength & perseverance of a people whose only crime was being born Jewish.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This is, hands down, the best YouTube downloader app in any app store! I have queued over 12 downloads at once with not a hiccup. It's even better than the programs available on the PC!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game will have your attention from the start captivating ur attention and drawing u into its simplistic 1 finger gameplay for hours as u create hundreds of discoveries from 4 base elements
0345529057|5.0|Love this set of Books. The print is a little smaller than I like but this was a great price. The shipping was fast!
B009GGWX5E|4.0|Some the the vocals are off key, but the remaster has good clarity.  Definitely not as good as DP's other live albums, but if you are a Tommy Bolin fan, this will be your only chance to hear him live with DP.  I'm a huge DP fan, so I wanted it to complete my collection.
B0026772N8|5.0|First gave this one a read shortly after it was published; re-read it for the 1st time in 40 years last week- it still resonates with my own values and gives me fresh insight into many things I hadn't considered- or had forgotten about!<br /><br />Certainly well-written!  This book has been the first book on philosophy for a great many people- and I can think of none better!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I am not always a &#34;book is better than the movie&#34; guy...but this book is definitely better than the movie!
B00992CF6W|5.0|its the best my dad got it for me and i love it at first i had discovery lite it is boring. you should get it its awesome.
B009XY97VC|5.0|I had to drop in here just to add my opinion, because frankly, I don't feel there are quite enough 5 star reviews for this album yet.  Having been a fan of the previous two albums, I decided to to purchase this today and have been listening to the tracks on repeat all day while I go about my daily tasks.  Somehow TSFH was able to top both previous albums - these songs are even more epic than the last and have enough variety to make the mind wander into the worlds they were created to distinctly describe.<br /><br />Excellent album all the way through - definitely worthy of my 8 dollars.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|Could not wait to see Red 2 and now waiting for release so I can watch back to back whenever I please
B008133MDK|5.0|the actors are amazing as well as the story line. If you love Sherlock Holmes and Conan Doyle, I guarantee you will love this! Season 3 is coming &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This is going to be short and sweet.  Why?  Because this book was long and stunk.  Besides the story's characters being unbelievable (a late 20's billionaire who is actually good looking?), the style was terrible.  I can put up with pure fiction characters, but I have to be able to enjoy the prose.  It read like a 16 year old watched her parents' VHS copy of &#34;9 1/2 weeks&#34; and thought she could do just as good while using the latest Cosmo 'How to drive your man/woman wild in bed' article as further reference.  This was pure mommy porn which had no porn.  IF you really want something that is hot and heavy, read the Sleeping Beauty trilogy by Anne Rice.  Enough said.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book. If you buy this, you won't be disappointed. Can't wait to read Catching Fire and Mockingjay. Enjoy this book.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Light weight and protective at the same time. The slinder case makes it easy to carry around. Would recommend to everyone!
B00594XOZU|5.0|This app is great, it sends the message really fast, and it shows when they are texting you and when they read it. If you like to text a lot I would get it!!
B00846REIS|4.0|I 'm glad this book had a storyline! I enjoy reading a frisky book occasionally but I need a beginning,middle and end not just sex!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Books on this subject have always fascinated me. This one was no exception.  Clearly written. Believable. Those with locked-in beliefs about mysteries of existence, etc., will probably not share my opinion.  Dr. Alexander's medical background made the report of his experience while in a coma more compelling.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|I have played this game a lot with some buddies at work.  It's fast, easy, strategic, and fun! Just wish it didn't come in a red velvet bag that looks like I'm carrying sex dice around with me.  :)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|tough but not too hard. this game is pretty fun though. I hope there is more levels added before I finish all of these.
B0026OR1UK|4.0|Well told and documented. This a good read about the process of developing skill and talent. I recommend it to all parents.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I've wasted a ridiculous amount of time on this deceptively simple game. The rush I experienced when I FINALLY snagged that damn parasailing tourist was so intense, my co-workers popped up like groundhogs to see what all the whooping was about.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is so amazing and fun and exciting and very cool.when you get the game  you will see how much fun it is.a lot of people might like it but I don't&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;........................dun dun dun dun *I LUV IT!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'M GOING TO PLAY IT RITE NOW THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!BY GUYS I HOPE YOU WILL ENJOY THE GAME
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game is so much better than gangstar Vegas by storyline and weapon and cars and also clothes<br />I really enjoyed it<br />I really recommend it to you guys
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I BOUGHT THIS SERIES WITHOUT READING ANYTHING ABOUT IT. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ANOTHER CRIME SERIES, ONE MORE IN A GREAT LINE OF BRITISH WHODUNITS. AS I WATCHED IT I KEPT WAITING FOR A MURDER OR AT LEAST A CRIME. AT FIRST I WAS DISAPPONTED, THEN I BECAME CAUGHT UP IN IT, LIKE AMERICAS DALLAS. I'M A HISTORY BUFF AND I LOVE DRAMAS DEVELOPING IN A HISTORIC SEQUENCE. I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS SEASON YET, BUT EAGERLY AWAIT IT AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE NEXT. YOU ALMOST FEEL YOUR A PART OF THE COMMUNITY. EITHER A LOST COUSIN OR UNKNOWN SON. WELL WORTH THE PRICE. ENJOY.
B005544V6A|5.0|A series that keeps you engaged and interested all 45min of every episode! It's amazing and a recommended must see!
0385537816|5.0|I collect books & this is a perfect way to have this wonderful trilogy. They even have ribbon book marks!
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|I thought the season started off well but was quite disheveled at the end.  The last episode seemed like the show was trying to cram in several new story lines at the last second and actually play them out as well.  It was quite strange.
B0035HKWLW|5.0|Great movie, our 13 yr olds love the childist humor. I think some of the pop culture references were not lost on them since these are truly classics.
B004XANKVO|4.0|The laptop sleeve inside the laptop compartment does not fit my thick 17\\" alienware, it still fits inside the compartment but outside of the sleeve with nothing else.<br /><br />All in all the bag seems well built, it has nice big thick zippers with silicone grips, dense foam on the back and shoulders and pretty much everything anyone is looking for in a day to day quality laptop bag.<br /><br />It doesn't have the hard shell as the pelican bags do nor does it meet the airport requirements but for majority ofpeople this doedoesn't matter.<br />I'm happy with the 100$ spent (sale)  and I'm sure you will be to.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Great stories again from George R. R. Martin , the game  continues with A Feast of Crows , you will love it !
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|My daughter recommended this to me and it is great. Fairly easy to use, but I haven't dug deeply, I'm sure it even does more than I use it for. Great for lists!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Season 1 was super slow for me but I'm glad its picking up and the stories are developing. I can't wait for season 4 on amazon. :):):)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's like having a real horse. You get to let them, play with them, groom them, train them and everything. The only critique that I would say is I wish I could have named and chose what my horse was.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Loved the book and the way she writes. Lots of detail but not to much to get you bored lol
B004LWZWGK|5.0|My husband is a huge Batman freak and now his collection is complete. What more can you ask for right?!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is so much fun! Its great for children they love all of the excitement and adventure and really this game is fun for children and adults. I have as much fun as the kids do i mean the controls easy to use and in creative mode you have every thing and you can fly and make whatever you want! In survival mode you can collect a bunch of stuff and you can make gold and diamond swords and if you ask me I think it is a thrilling game for the whole family! And when the upgrade comes in you can chat to people on your world so minecraft is a way for my kids to talk to their friends when they join worlds! Another thing i love about the minecraft is when my kids get bored they can play it because in the minecraft you have to use your brain unlike some games but I really love the minecraft and i know i know the upgrades take awhile to come but the original is great already so when the first upgrade comes in your kids will be so thrilled!!!
B00E1L9N8E|3.0|&#34;The Great Gatsby&#34; follows Fitzgerald-like, would-be writer Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) as he leaves the Midwest and comes to New York City in the spring of 1922, an era of loosening morals, glittering jazz, bootleg kings, and sky-rocketing stocks. Chasing his own American Dream, Nick lands
B009UX2YAC|1.0|So my little girl loves the game so much and she had been saving up all of her coins to get a different person and she was so close she only had a couple more coins to go and so one day she got on to play with a big smile on her face and a couple seconds after i started doing my bills she comes in the room with her eyes full of tears and the saddest look on her face. Whats wrong i asked while hugging her. I lost all of my coins she said while sniffling. Aww sweet heart i know how hard you worked on getting all of those coins. Do you want to go play to catch up on where you were? I asked her while giving her a kiss. No! I dont ever want to play that game again! She said then she stomped off to her room and one day my son said hey mommy can i get subway surffers and i said no sweet heart its not as fun as it looks and i said that because i didn't want him to get upset like his sister did
0812550757|4.0|great read for middle school kids. coming of age book. most of the book dragged on, but the ending was so beautiful, it was worth it.
B008Q0D32S|5.0|don't know how many times I have seen this movie but I can tell you I never get tired of it.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and at the same time relaxing. I like the narration of the and the music. The graphics are great too. I do wish the puzzles would be more challenging sooner. All in all I love it.
B000YMM3CC|4.0|The Notebook is a beautiful summer love story with a twist.  The movie starts with an old man, Duke, reading to an old lady, Allie, who has Alzheimer.  The watcher is then swept up in young love.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A poignant summer read.  Magic, mystery, witches who aren't witches, spells which aren't spells, where anything is possible, including oceans at the end of the lane.  The stuff childhood is made of.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Now that I can watch on Amazon, I know what the fuss is about. The story lines are unpredictable and the acting is superior.  I'm completely hooked!
B003F5NSTW|5.0|I read about this book in my last month of pregnancy and it terrified me.<br />18 months later, I finally summoned the courage to pick this up and read it.  A well-written book which I would recommend.<br />Who knows where the fault lies, with the child or the mother? A little bit of blame sharing is probably in line.<br />Anyway, in real life often there are no rules, no warning signals (that Kevin so conveniently displays), sometimes they just come out of the blue and hit you in the face.
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|i love this movie. It is one of my favorite movies, Brings back some memories. Graphics were great as I live streamed it and quality was great.
0307455874|5.0|I will reveal my bias before my review; I am a great admirer of Barack Obama the man and usually the president. I came into this book having already read 2 (maybe 3) other books written on him but never his own books.<br /><br />The first 2-3 chapters were superficial and not in depth at all and I didn't feel I was getting anything out of the book. Later that feeling subsided as I entered chapters about faith, family, foreign policy etc.<br /><br /> I was confused at first about what this book was portraying. It is neither autobiography nor memoir and he explicitly claims he doesn't want it to act as a template of his political beliefs as he says they are not stagnant.<br /><br />In these pages Obama professes his love for public service and problem solving and it is easy to see he tries not to identify too closely with either party. He is quick to denounce liberal and conservative ideas he believes are ideological or separatist and many times writes of the positivity of compromise. His intelligence shows strongly when he appears to step out of the realm of political parties in order to improve his beliefs.<br /><br />This book is as relevant today as it was when it was written. I deemed him nostradamis when he wrote of the polarizing politicians of today's congress. Little d he know the polarizing effect would be strengthened during his presidency. Obama really is a centrist politician despite what ultra conservatives may claim.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|i really enjoy this movie. I recommended this movie for those that like suspense triller, the plot was great and it kept you guessing.
B00563M11M|5.0|It's yet another Pratchett book, and that's something I could never get enough of. Incredibly funny, it still manages to make us know a little more about ourselves once we finish it.
B00CXQL828|5.0|Bought the album while on vacation in NYC.<br /><br />Outstanding Hard Rock supergroup and debut album.  Got to see them live at BB Kings NYC, wow!<br />If you liked Black Country Communion and missing them, these are the guys to follow next.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B000002J0P|4.0|&#34;Suite: Judy Blue Eyes&#34; is one of my all-time favorite songs from that innocent, idealistic era--Nixon but pre-Watergate, Vietnam, Woodstock. Their harmonies are tight and true, their lyrics are apolitical. It was a great time.
B000JZ68GG|4.0|OK, the movie is basically a Sci-Fi T&A flick.  Not recommended for the little ones, but it's a real scream to watch with a group of adults.  Jane Fonda rediscovers the joys of physical sex with pretty much all the male characters in the movie while trying to stop the run-away mad scientist from unleashing a terrible weapon on the galaxy.  A true &#34;B&#34; movie classic.  If you haven't seen it or haven't seen it in many years, you should enjoy this.
B00CGYK9O0|4.0|A little tricky to write on with the actual chalk.  Great if you're writing ONE word--- I used it to label teas in mason jars for a tea party, and it was cute, but hard to get in 2 words and clean/erase.  Would get 5 stars if it had a better stylus.
B0078Q2HAA|1.0|First, Jim Broadbent's and Meryl Streep's performances were, as always, great!  So if you just want to be transported by great acting then this is a good movie to watch.  If you have any interest into an insightful look into Margaret Thatcher, not just her dementia, but her life and political career, this is not it.<br /><br />I was looking forward to leaving with a sense of history, to understanding what made Margaret Thatcher tick, anything that gave a glimpse of the momentous time when Mrs. Thatcher led.<br /><br />Instead I was perplexed and felt sorry for a demented woman who was imprisoned in her own house with just her memories, finally moved by compassion, which just drag on and on until I finally zzz zzzz zzzz great movie to watch if you can sleep.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like this game it is neat to build a town,my kids LOVE this game. Only thing &quot;not so cool&quot; about it is that to get the better stuff u have to use invest points which are EXTREMELY hard to get with real money or a Facebook account. All In all this is a cool game
B009RX85N0|5.0|After watching season 1 I couldn't wait for season 2 to come out on DVD. I only hope the show continues to season 3! (I hate cliffhangers!)  It is very refreshing from all the usual shows on TV. The show is very well done. There are very few shows out there that I just wish had more and would go on and on - this is one of those rare shows.  Anyone who likes to enjoy (a twist on) fairy tales and magic won't be disappointed.<br /><br />As much as I loved season 1, season 2 is even BETTER!  This season introduced us to Captain Hook - GREAT character!  I hope the show continues!

B002I88BK8|5.0|I read this because my step-son's English III class was required to read it over the summer.  It's an excellent book for adults.  I am not 100% sold on it being an appropriate read for high school students.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|This was an excellent 3D presentation of an amazing act of athleticism. Being able to see it from different perspectives that would not have been available in a live audience made it even better.
B008H08XW2|5.0|Loved this CD! Full of great Maroon 5 songs. So good! I definitely recommend buying this CD. I loved it!
B004XZ99LO|5.0|This is an amazing feature made even better by the 3D perspective. A live audience couldn't have seen this from all the different views, let alone pause and back-up to see some amazing feats over again.
B005LAJ212|5.0|I received this DVD as part of a basket of ABC shows that I won in a local TV station drawing, that also included \\"Once Upon A Time\\".  I put off watching it as I didn't really think I'd like it.  But, after having watched most of the other series DVD's, like \\"Once..........\\" and Castle, and The Shield, etc., I finally decided to pop it into the player one night.<br /><br />What can I say?  When I'm wrong, I'm wrong!  This show grabbed me right from the very start!  And not just me, but my picky teenaged son!  It's one of the few shows that he watches without doing something else, like playing a video game or listening to a CD.<br /><br />The characters are simply fantastic.  Our favorite good guys are, of course, Emily, Nolan, Jack, and Declan whose character had some incredible growth over the course of the season.  There are so many bad guys, it's hard to list them out.  And there are so many sides to these people that you find yourself hating them one time and feeling for them the next.<br /><br />The plots are so unpredictable that you just don't see things coming, yet they never get into the \\"get real!\\" category.  They always make sense.<br /><br />My biggest complaint in the series is the way Victoria was dressed and styled.  It seemed to me that she wore the same style all too often.  You'd think with her money, her taste would be better.  She also needs to do something with her hair.  It's usually worn straight and boring, but when it was sometimes put up, it was unbecoming.  They could do something with her make-up, too.  It makes her look old and therefore some of the romance scenes, especially the ones done in the past, are kind of unbelieveable.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!!  In the last episode I really thought Emily and Jack were going to finally get together, and was heartbroken when Amanda showed back up.  And showed up pregnant!  I thought the Asian guy said he'd taken care of her!  I thought she was gone.  But noooooooooooooooooo!!<br /><br />Anyway, I have to say it was a superb show and I will be ordering Season 2 today.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a show that keeps you glued to the set.I have to say it was a superb show and I will be ordering Season 2 today.

B005OCFGTO|5.0|The story speaks for itself. Package arrived on time and was well wrapped. All discs appear in to be in good working order. Perfect collection for the price.
0988178532|4.0|My first impression of Outview, with its high-school aged protagonists and \\"coming of age\\" theme, was \\"interesting but I'm a bit beyond teen fiction.\\" However, a few chapters in, I began to be reminded of early Robert Heinlein like Have Spacesuit Will Travel; indeed, Legg's narrative quickly turns a socio-political corner into the territory of Red Planet and soon becomes downright controversial a la Starship Troopers, yet Outview is not Science Fiction but Fantasy.<br /><br />More akin to Glory Road but without the techno-mystical musings that would come later in Stranger In A Strange Land, it deals with magic in an incredible but certainly less fantastical, alternate-reality, manner than the cartoonish tales of Piers Anthony's land of Xanth or Alan Dean Foster's Spellsinger series.  The slow reveal of the powerful hidden realms of magic kept me engaged while the plot spun out in unexpected narrative twists which were skillfully woven into the fabric of what is sure to be a fully engaging series. I am quite relieved that, having been slow to tackle this title, the second book has already been released and I can jump right into the continuing story.
B000UJ48O0|5.0|packaged perfectly, all discs played well. As for the series. super accurate for life in the real OC. I completely recomend to all those drama lovers out there.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I liken this to  Homeland Security the difference being this is much better! You will not be disappointed! Acting is superb by all the characters and you will develop a love/hate relationship with many of them!

B00DDZM0GQ|2.0|I would love to give this app 5 stars because it is so much fun and addicting. BUT WHY DOES IT NEED DATA CONNECTION? I recently tried to play on the plane and the app opened, said it needed connection and  then immediately closed itself. very sad :-(
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This movie is a lighthearted comedy full of great A-Capella arrangements, and funny one-liners. Even after watching it multiple times, I laugh throughout the movie.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Great book told from Drews POV. It was witty, fun, crude and just awesome. Enjoyable book with characters that had depth.
B001223BLU|5.0|Being a fan of only the heaviest of metal this was an interesting purchase for me. A friend( much older than I) got laid up after surgery and asked if I could find him some tunes to chill with. Liking him I downloaded a few for him, this being one of em. I decided to check it out after reading the titles and remembering some of it from my past.As I burned it I listened and over the next few days I listened to it a few times. As I stated, im a metal head(and proud to be one) but this is really good. Good enough to keep a copy on my ipod. They don't write music like this anymore. If youre a fan of this era of music then I would definitely recommend this. Slap full of good time hits and one of the few cds ive got that my daughter and me can enjoy together!!! and enjoy it we do!!!
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I have been riveted from the very beginning.  Each book led fluently to the next with the same amount of intrigue.

B003XVYLDU|3.0|Apparently, Kurt Vonnegut regarded this work as a failure. It's also listed in the top one hundred science fiction books one ought to have read.<br />Well, I have read it now and whilst I don't perhaps consider it a a failure, it is neither science fiction nor a classic novel. In fact, I got to the end wondering when it would start. So it goes.<br />It is merely a narration around an experience of the Dresden bombing, with an American character who would be better placed chatting with Willy Lomax or sitting under a tree with Vladimir and Estragon, or even, perhaps, sitting quietly listening to the Joad family as they head towards an non-existent Californian orange utopia. The narrative is broken, the narrative makes you wonder if Audrey Niffenegger read and re-read it before thinking of a wife for her particular time traveller, the narrative oscillates between a portrayal of the absurd that comes nowhere close to the skills of Samuel Beckett and Eugene Ionesco and a mundane relating of a man who has lived through a war that lost its purpose in the mind of an individual before it even started.<br />Characters are sketches in this book, each as inconsequential and vapid as Montana Wildback, as Edgar Derby, as Roland Weary, as Kilgore Trout, as Wild Bob. The time in the prisoner of war camp makes me think of all those darkly humorous Hollywood film of the fifties and sixties where stereotypes abound of the stiff upper lip Englishman, the overbearing American, the gullible German and the wintry Russian. The novel is a sketch of something bigger, pretends to grab the coattails of iconic expressions of novel sub-genres.<br />Billy Pilgrim is a man who gives into the lie he is told to avoid. He gives into the easy determinism of letting fate take over his life; of letting his mind and body be tossed like a leaf in Vonnegut's winds of past, present, and future. As a reader we are swept up in his personal tornado...we just never make it to Oz, rather we are stuck on Tralfamadore, with no free will, a plaything of fatalism.<br />Two sentences did stick with me:<br />the first \\"It is, in the imagination of combat's fans, the divinely listless loveplay, that follows the orgasm of victory.

B0084670FU|5.0|This movie is film making at it's finest.  It's amazing how they were able to intertwine all of these stories beautifully.  Nothing was ever tacky or predictable.  You always expected the worse but the writing was so brilliant that it wouldn't just &#34;always go to the extreme.&#34;  Some of the most emotional, deep, purpose driven acting from every character.  And it was beautiful to see how other cultures handle certain situations much differently from each other.  The cinematography and film score was also fantastic.  There wasn't a single line of dialogue, plot point, actor, etc that I didn't like or became bored with.  This film is a masterpiece!!
B003TOMAPC|2.0|I rented this movie because I saw some of it on TV is start out all right me a got a lot of cussing in got lot of bad language in it. I don't mind some language but when they use couple other cuss words. Then I just quit watching it. So five stars I rate this at 1 1/2 stars.

055358202X|4.0|I first started reading A Song of Ice and Fire years ago, when only the first three books were out. I loved them at the time, devouring them eagerly, and then I kind of forgot about them, due to the long lapse between books three and four. When book four came out, I kept putting off reading it because it had been so long I knew I'd have forgotten a good part of what happened. When the series began airing, I started watching, got hooked again, and finally decided to reread the first three books before venturing into this one, all because I wanted to know what was going to happen before the HBO series could spoil it for me.<br /><br />This series is a funny thing. I love it, get so caught up in the many, many plot threads and that phenomenal characterization, yet there are some things about it that annoy me too. Sometimes I have to drag myself through passages, all the while wishing I could get back to reading about the characters I care about. Given how many wheels are in motion, I get why Martin feels he has to tell the story from so many perspectives, so the reader can see all the pieces as they move, but that doesn't mean I always like it. This book is no exception. Some spoilers to follow.<br /><br />I'm not one of those readers who was disgruntled about only reading about half of the characters. That was okay with me, as about half the characters I like were in the book and the other half will be in the next. Yes, it was a bit annoying at times, particularly when I'd read something from Sam's perspective and be left wondering what was going on in Jon's head, but for the most part, I was fine with how the book was constructed.<br /><br />What did annoy me, though, is the sense that this book is more bloated than it needs to be. I think a textbook examples takes place during the Iron Islanders' kingsmoot, during which the reader is treated to something like 1.5 pages of a character blowing a frickin' horn. Yep, that much page time, devoted to florid descriptions of the sound of the horn, and the face of the guy blowing it. It probably goes without saying, but this wasn't my idea of scintillating reading. Due to the millions of plot twists in this series, the books are going to be long, and that's fine. But I really object to things like this, which just slow down the narrative and annoy me. I felt like the entire kingsmoot could have been done justice in a few paragraphs. Ditto with the extensive detailing of the heraldic devices of every last house in Westeros, no matter how small and insignificant to the story. I don't care, I really don't. All I need to know is that Lannisters use a lion, the Starks have a direwolf, the Baratheons fly a crowned stag, and the Targaryens have a three-headed dragon. Done. I don't need to know about Green Apple Fossoways versus Red Apple Fossoways, and flayed men, etc., etc., etc. It becomes mind-numbing after a while. Martin is also given to repetition, with his repeated detailing of the chains of the maesters serving as one example. Editing is a good thing. Editing keeps the story moving and minimizes the draggy parts that annoy readers. Embrace the editing, George R. R. Martin!<br /><br />I'm also annoyed by the Iron Islanders. They just feel like a superfluous complication to me. There's enough going on with the intrigue in Dorne, the machinations of the Lannisters, the plight of the Starks, the drama at the Wall, and Stannis to make things plenty complicated without bring the Iron Islanders into it. I don't find them interesting, I'm not invested in any of them, and I just plain don't care about them. Whenever I have to read about one of them, it's like a chore, like having to read a textbook for some boring pre-requisite college course. Maybe it's because the Iron Islanders don't feel to me like they have any shades of gray, and because I don't find anything with which to sympathize. I can sympathize with the Hound. With Theon or Aeron or Asha or Euron, not so much. Go away, kraken, soI can get back to reading about Arya's fascinating journey.<br /><br />Fortunately, Martin's knack for characterization and for examining the many ways people undo themselves and others saves the book from being dull. I don't always feel like I need to read about all the characters Martin chooses to write about, but I can't help but be in awe of the way he can create such a vast, vast cast of characters and make every one of them feel unique. It's a talent that I think every author should envy.<br /><br />There are so many things that happen in this book that shocked me, disturbed me, and made me cheer. One of the best, though, was witnessing the way Cersei brings about her own downfall. I've always despised her character, so I enjoyed reading about her destroying herself. She likes to think she's a female version of Tywin, but it couldn't be more obvious that she's nothing like her father.<br /><br />My favorite in this book, though, was Brienne. It was so satisfying to see her character more fleshed out and to get insight into her. The other thing about her character that I find so enriching to the series as a whole is the way her relationship with Jaime contributes to his development. Sometimes I love Jaime and sometimes I can't stand him, but nothing has done more to bring out his humanity and make him a more interesting character than his relationship with Brienne and the ways it changes him. She provides such a valuable lens through which to view him. I'm not sure what to make of her journey in this book, though I have some suspicions about what might have come to pass in her last chapter, and it'll be interesting to see if there's anything to my speculations.<br /><br />Another aspect of the book that I found so fascinating was seeing how the house of cards is beginning to collapse now that Tywin has been removed from the equation. It's striking the extent to which he was the glue that held not only the Lannisters, but much of the realm together. I knew whenhe met his fate in book three that it would leave a power vacuum, and it was so interesting to see what happened as a consequence. It's almost as if the Westerosi are working hard to bring about their own downfall, and Tywin was the only one who could save them from themselves--as disturbing as that thought is, given how much I loathed Tywin.<br /><br />Equally fascinating, though, is Littlefinger. I can't quite see where he's going with all his scheming, but I'm beginning to think he may be the one to win in the end. For as much as Varys seemed like the dangerous one, it's now so obvious that Littlefinger was the one of whom everyone else would have been wise to be wary. Since there are so many characters in this series who conquer by sword and blood, it's interesting to read about how Littlefinger users subtler tools--persuasion, flattery, deception--to achieve the same ends. As of now, the only character who I think is a match for him as far as brains and wits go is Tyrion.<br /><br />All in all, I found this book a satisfying continuation of the ASOIF saga. The book clearly moved the narrative on to the next stage of the story, and it feels like things are starting to come together, for better or worse. I'm moving on to A Dance with Dragons and only hope I won't have a long, long wait for book six, as having to reread the first five books before tackling the sixth would be a monumental task indeed.

B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The premise behind the book/movie is kind of disturbing but the story line and movie are so well done, you are drawn in and can't stop watching! A lot of action and emotion but not disgusting or gross.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Powerful book. The \\"lesson learned\\" incorporated in this most interesting biography  of Nokola Tesla was well worth the read. It inspired me to look at my life and wonder what I can do with it, even at my age (65) and circumstance. The one thing I will do to make my world a better place is recommend this book. It should be required reading every year from 7th grade to college graduation.
1451626096|3.0|Philippa Gregory always writes well;  I expect that from her.  And she writes well here.  But the novel was a bit of a disappointment.  It focuses on the first fourteen years of Henry VII's reign, and his marriage to Elizabeth of York.  At some point early on, the story becomes a one-trick pony and keeps repeating itself.  Henry Tudor does not trust Elizabeth or her family, as she is from the rival house of York.  There are constant recriminations over this, especially when a York pretender appears on the horizon.  The pretender is defeated, and there is some reconciliation between the king and queen.  A new pretender appears, and the mistrust and anger resurface.  Henry is constantly paranoid about being a pretender himself, and is always looking over his shoulder for new rebellions. People always seem to be living in fear.  The entire book is about all of this, even though history remembers Henry as an able diplomat, a shrewd administrator, and a financial hardhead who amassed a personal fortune of nearly one billion dollars in today's money. All of this is barely touched on. This book finally became a bit wearying for this reader, as history (and marital resentments) kept repeating themselves.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|wow these books are far more character developed than the 50 shades of grey novels ...favorite by far! I am so glad I checked this out!

B003CHGV74|5.0|This is the art of story telling at it's finest.  This show is surreal, absurd, dark, absorbing, hilarious, thought-provoking, and utterly engrossing.  The acting is top-notch, the writing is brilliant - just... watch it already.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is a marriage made of convenience and that would be great if the equal partners weren't afraid of love - because it's love that makes marriage between a couple with a scared and imperfect background (something we all have) a successful endeavor. This book deserves five stars because it is a well written tale worth telling, and not because I approve of the pages long love making described so well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game because its like subway surf's and its sooooooo fun to play .I also like doing the battles

B002ZG97EC|5.0|Blu-ray version is excellent and the bonus for digital download even better.

B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|Original 3-star review: Infinite was fun until I got to level 28 I can't progress because the game won't restart with any tiles. It starts, then crashes immediately (over 26 times in a row). Sometimes it freezes on my android tablet. When I turn it off, I have start over at level 24. Also the banners \\"upcoming\\", etc. are annoyingly long and interrupt play.<br /><br />Zen mode is OK for a few minutes, but gets old. Survival mode is not compatible with my arthritic fingers. I'm glad I got it free.<br /><br />9/21/13: Slydris update this week has solved the failure to restart problem. I am now on level 35. So far, no crashing. Now, if they could get rid of the annoyingly large and persistent banners that interfere with play, this game would be almost perfect.
B001BC2ZS6|2.0|Enough said. It was horribly sad and awful. In my opinion I don't know that its a classic. Very. Depressing.
B002NNA9N0|1.0|this movie had been recommended to me by a friend.  I found it dull, and filled with a lot of offensive language.  I stopped watching it well before it was done as it was not entertaining to me in the least.
B0054SMID0|3.0|I grew up wanting to be a lawyer as a kid. I grew up watching perhaps the best show of the 1990s, easily the best show in the drama category of that decade-The Practice, followed by its spin-off Boston Legal, as an adult. But I didn't think I'd be as interested in this movie, probably because watching a lawyer on film is different from watching one on television. But I gave it a shot. I won't exhaust you with the details of the storyline or criticize Matthew Mcconaughey (which seems to be a popular thing to do), given that there are over a thousand reviews of this movie, but I will briefly say, this is a film about a lawyer whose client turns out to be something he initially suspected and they take turns outdoing one another, which has fatal consequences.<br /><br />I agree with those who gave this film a 3-star rating. I also give it a 3-star/3-1/2 star rating. It's an ok/decent film, nothing too exciting or original and not a horrible or even bad movie.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|I can only imagine that this is a good game, for although I tried to download it to my Andioid tablet, Amazon apps have been<br />hit or miss as per whether I get them or not since the recent upgrade to Android 4.3. I'm hoping this will be resolved soon.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Dad to use and I use it often! This is my go to calculator! It makes bill planning so much more efficient when I can just pull up this app<br /><br />Thanks again.
0545403359|4.0|I bought this for my great nephew and we watched it together on one of his overnights.  He loved it although there were a couple of places where it was pretty gruesome for a 12 year old.  I thought the movie was really very good although I always rate the books higher than movies.  My nephew had read the book I had gotten for him so he kept pointing out the differences and at the end of the movie, said &#34;It's really a good movie, but the book was even better.&#34;  He was so proud, though, that he got to watch it before anyone else in his family and the other kids (younger) weren't allowed to see it because of the violence.
B007L5LD9O|5.0|Will always love this movie...  It is a classic..  can watch it over and over..and this version is done wonderfully.  I loved it

B0046ECFRM|5.0|Stephanie Perkins is an amazing story writer. I feel in love with Anna. Her novelist father sent her off to Paris to show the world that he had made something of himself. A great book to movie writer turned rich. Of course Anna despised him for leaving all her life long friends. Being timid and soft spoken it was hard for Anna to open up. What she didn't know that this would be the best senior she could have ever asked for. She meets handsome beau magnifique Etienne St. Clair whom she likes but isn't allowed to. 1 because her new bf is infatuated 2 he has a girlfriend. Following Anna on her journey made my heart feel good. I wanted in her clique and wanted to be her best friend. This is a wonderful book and the best I have read in a while. This is the first book I have read by Stephanie Perkins and I will be sure to read the rest.
B00BUAEYVK|2.0|Seen it all before but this one is done far worse. Basically everyone mailed it in on this one - acting, directing, story - not one redeeming feature in the whole movie. Basically the dialog is to fill in time between the explosions, car wrecks, and gun mayhem. Basically a live action cartoon for grown ups who never grew up.

B004YW4L5K|5.0|I suppose to a Brit our America is more about myth and gods, than it is about politics and reality.  did I say politics and reality?  silly me.<br /><br />America is a mythological place - even to those of us living here, and especially to those of us born here.  america is all dreams and the dreams of our parents.<br /><br />and there are the old gods from the old countries and the new gods of now, and then there's sasquatch, a few headless horsemen, throw in a thunderbird, a buffalo woman, the cia and superman, to mention a mere few.<br /><br />in this book, all our gods are being rallied to go to war.  or perhaps it's all a figment of someone's imagination.  but probably not.  there's some strange happenings afoot.<br /><br />this is a special book and I highly recommend it.  beautifully written, wild imaginative ride, it's well worth reading and although it's not a short book by any stretch of the imagination, it moves quickly. so read it at least once or twice to sop up all the details with bread. maybe three times.  keep going and read it every year.  why not?  it's that good.<br /><br />I've noticed lately too many reviewers pretty much tell you what the book is about, where it goes, all the characters, plot twists and even endings so that by the time you think you're interested enough to want to buy it, you already know way too much.  I'm not doing that.  if you want to know the secrets of this book, buy it and read it.  or cheat yourself and read the reviews.  I guarantee if you read all of them, you'll know everything there is to know about this book, cover to cover.  except you won't experience the excellence of the author's writing.  it's beautifully written.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Reza Aslan came to my attention thanks to Fox News and their incredibly offensive interview, so first of all I must grudgingly thank Fox for leading me to such a learned and readable scholar. I might have found him by accident, but Fox made it a &#34;must read&#34;. &#34;Zealot&#34; is much more the Times of Jesus of Nazareth than the Life; that's because so little is known of his real life. Most of what we know has been overshadowed by the myths created by his followers after his death (few of whom actually knew him). Dr. Aslan makes a valiant, and generally successful attempt to separate the man from the myth. We learn of his birth (in Nazareth, not Bethlehem), what little can be be deduced from his early life based in general on life in small rural communities, his large family (~7 siblings). Then on to his ministry, which bears little resemblance to the myths written later.  The larger focus is on the times he lived in; a violent, dangerous time, with constant conflict in &#34;Palestine&#34; between the Roman overlords, the priestly class, the wealthy aristocracy, the poor and downtrodden. It was a time of assimilation, with many of the rich &#34;romanizing&#34; their families, just as minorities have done in the 2,000 years since (and probably 2,000 years before). Putting Jesus the man into his milieu is quite revealing; I won't ever see him and his followers the same way again.<br /><br />I have one minor quibble with the work, which I normally would have downgraded my review to 4 stars for, but the overall impact of Zealot overrode this objection: Dr. Aslan repeats the same incidents, in all of their detail, multiple times (e.g., the story of Jesus curing and cleansing the leper). I attribute this to poor editing; once the story has been told, future references to it should just have reminded the reader of what has already been said rather than repeating it word for word. I suspect this happened because Zealot was probably assembled from a group of papers orlectures where each had to stand on its own. But once combined into a book the editor should have caught the repeats.

B008220C38|1.0|I was looking forward to this movie. I loved the book. I enjoy period dramas espcially those based on a literary work. This movie disappoints on all levels. The costumes are beautiful, but alas, they cannot redeem this self-indulgent piece of garbage. I respect the past work of all the actors in this movie and don't lay the blame at their feet. I would say that this seems to be the fault of the writer and director. I could only watch about 20 minutes of this. What really makes me angry is that a big budget was given to make a movie based on Tolstoy's work. They made this piece of crap instead. If you haven't read the book, you might not make much sense of what is happening. If you have read the book, it's not likely that you'll enjoy this artsy-fartsy indulgence. Seriously, it angers me. Was this made to interest the MTV crowd in Tolstoy's great story. The story itself is enough. The story should be THE thing. Boo hiss. If I could review this and give it no stars, I would. Waste of money and, worse, waste of time.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|Unlikely and extreme storyline.<br />They'll mention Eagle's football. Show beer drinking and tailgating.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|2/3 of the book was brutally slow. After 4 books you would think the 5th would begin to have some closure to the many characters and subplots but it only added to it. George needs to figure out a way to end this story!
B004SIP6QI|5.0|Good movie....makes you appreciate the &#34;easy&#34; in lifestyle today!  Makes you appreciate people and their differences and how we can share our abilities and talents with others.  Sad movie cuz shows the &#34;hard&#34; parts and realities in life.  Better times still doesn't protect us from the hard parts.  We can learn from this movie to appreciate the basics in life and be happy with those.

B002VHI8J0|5.0|I loved it! A very cleverly-written story, challenging in more that one way, with the various changes of style, scene, characters - and yet everything is connected in surprising way.
140006922X|1.0|I was very excited to hear about this book as I thought that it would shed some light on all aspects of the time that Jesus lived from daily living to the political climate of the time. This book turned out to be a book trying to prove that Jesus was not our Savior but just another political figure. Even the author seemed perplexed at points about his own thesis.<br /><br />I did not like this book at all. It starts off ok but you find out very quickly that the author couples obvious facts with his opinions with phrases akin to \\"seems to\\" or \\"appears to\\" to get the reader to believe that he has some deep knowledge of the persons thoughts/feelings at the time.<br /><br />The best way to describe this book is conjecture. The author obviously has an axe to grind. I  did not find this book to be revealing about the time period or about the \\"historical Jesus\\" but I did find it quite revealing about the author.<br /><br />One other item that I found very odd was that while the author provided references at the end of the hard cover version you have no idea what these references were used for as the main text does not provide sites within his story.<br /><br />I would not spend any time on this book.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|A gripping story that deals with the question of assisted suicide in a realistic context even though at times it tends to become simplistic and cliche. Nevertheless a good read!
B005MLOOJA|5.0|it was gripping and I cant wait until season 4 becomes available. It was one of the best tv series Ive ever seen.
B00CTMA95S|3.0|I am a fan of Mr. Rollins. One of the things that Rollins's thrillers always compeled me was his imagination (of course!) and extrapolations of little know facts. That mix was extremely compeling for me. Nevertheless, this title fails that conception.<br />The whole line of this tittle is a mixture of romance, legends, and a totally wrong science. I would not comment the plot described, but is little credible to have a Dark Energy object like this book describes. Also, the properties of the dark energy are poorly described, and also the times. I was expecting a worth succesor of &#34;Devil Colony&#34; and &#34;Blood Line&#34;, but I was flashbacked to &#34;Deep Phatom&#34; and &#34;Ice Hunt&#34;. Maybe the book was intended to do so, but I'd expect more for a future Sigma series title.<br />Final lines for me: good book, great imagination and ending, but a long stretch on science.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|This box set is MARVELOUS bring the original version and the enhanced remastered one too...You have an unique experience of Star Trek TOS!
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Yes I did, I liked it enough to like things, I want to rate it, but I don't want to write a review.
B004UQPM4E|5.0|It's just marvelous this box set with one extra BD of Extras, The movies are simple GREAT! Fans buy without afraid! Worth every peny!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Only thing is sometimes touch has to be very specific and hard to tell not right or I haven't hit the right spot yet.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I love the new TV series of Arrow! Lots of action and fight scenes and the actor playing the part of Arrow is great. The actor playing Arrow is wonderful and puts good emotion into his part and the rest of the cast is good too. The stories are very good and well written. This series is based on comic hero Green Arrow, but a good job was done with the acting and story so it's not corny-just good story telling. The actor playing Arrow is very good looking and physically nice to look at (he must work out a lot). If you like good drama and action shows with great acting and a hero, then you'll like this series. I highly recommend this series.
B00D6MJOAQ|4.0|People were tripping over the new Daft Punk, which I don't mind, but this is the record people should've been clamoring over.  Those who know, know, those who sleep on this are missing out on some great electronica.  Chill, trippy and original.  This is as good a place to start as any for new fans but their entire catalog is amazing.  Too long of a wait for this but well worth it.
B00CEF014E|2.0|This book was a mess. The characters were poorly written, with very little back story to ground them. It was absolutely unimaginable that the action in this story could have occurred, the \\"heroine\\" in the story is suppose to be very fragile and tiny and not exactly mentally stable. To have her turn into the person she does in a few days is ridiculous. I would not recommend this book.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Great game to play anytime! Enjoy it with or without friends! Add this game to your collection for hours of fun! Brings back childhood memories for sure!
B00785P2QC|3.0|This game is entertaining, but it takes a lot of time to get enough money to do anything. I do like it though. It's great for people who like to build towns (obviously), but it's one of the better choices to pick. The goals help guide you to success you just have  to be wise in the choices you make or you'll end up broke and having to wait haha.
B0058RCVYS|4.0|I found this movie very interesting because of a man facing death and trying to set up his wife with her former lover.  It was very loving.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Pretty good movie, one person really can make a difference that's for sure. Tom Cruise has many great movies !
0395389496|5.0|This book was a great gift and with the added bonus of the CD just put it over the top!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Great Show - Can't wait to watch season 3 !<br /><br />I love the old day aspect and  o see how it was way back when.
B00DDXJRJG|1.0|Could not believe this app after I loaded it. It's just a volume control with lights. Tried Kindle with & without this app. No difference was noted.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My son found it while playing on my mom's IPad - now we have it on Kindle and IPhone, it's really cute.  The dragons are really cute, and you get to build up your islands just the way you like.
B002MUAJ2A|4.0|I really liked some ideas and the way the authors think, but I do not think these ideas apply neither for everyone nor for every job. It is more directed for entrepeneurs and/or people who work at startups. It is definitely an easy and good book for everyone to read.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|It sounded pretty creepy when my son first downloaded it - but it's more mad scientist, then creepy, though it does have a bit of the creepy factor.  Enjoyed unlocking the various stages, and seeing how far you can take it.  Makes you think like scientist, while making you wonder what would really happen if this was real.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I would strongly suggest this music for the hippie in you, of all ages. It is decidedly clever and fun. It also seduces the listener into a 60s feel, whether you were there or not. Order this. You're gonna love it!
B005UG542S|5.0|The seventh and final book of the HP series is certainly the most action packed.  The movie does not disappoint.  It stays fairly true to the plot and is probably the best movie of the series (along with part 1).  If you enjoy the books, you will enjoy this movie.  If you do not enjoy the books and just want an entertaining movie, you will enjoy it.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|This music is very 60s psychedelic. Very pleased with the sound quality as well. I definite recommend for all your old hippies and lovers of 60s Hendrix stuff.
B00E25KVLW|3.0|The concepts are there. It isn't bad for beginners.  Aside from the spelling errors and grammatical problems the concepts are solid.  There are better books for the money but this one is quite approachable for someone starting to learn Rails 4.
0061780308|5.0|An exceptional story written in a way that will give your attention and emotion a ride for its life. I cannot say enough about the shire brilliance of this novel. the view form the dog's standpoint is so authentic sounding that you suspend disbelief in an instant. would definitely recommend this novel to all, thought is should be read by those over 18. the narrator was also excellent. Enjoy!
0375842209|4.0|This piercingly intimate portrayal of Nazi Germany, narrated by the voice of death and following the life of a German foster child, is beautifully written and unforgettable. I am always moved by themes like the power of words and/or books and how they can change lives so dramatically--for better or for worse. The Book Thief manages to delicately embody the charming magnificence of childhood while illustrating the gravity of wartime tragedy. It's as if each moment of the book simultaneously holds exquisite beauty and searing heartbreak. But all in all, it's a story of grace, resilience, and the power of words. I absolutely loved it.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I started reading this series 10 years ago, and when Robert Jordan passed away I thought all was lost. I'm glad that Brandon Sanderson took up his legacy and brought this world back to life so we could all see Jordan's vision of the end.
B00AH69MS8|5.0|Metallica's first three albums were the best and defined thrash metal.  Every song on this album a gem and will never lose that feel of thrash metal at it's best.  Master of Puppets along with Kill Em' All and Ride the Lightning will always be Metallica.  I can without the rest.
B00992CF6W|2.0|Can't get it downloaded to my Kindle Fire!  Seems to take FOREVER!!!!!! I've tried doing the download on a plane then at a family's home personal wifi and a public place's FREE WIFI?
B000IDEORY|5.0|My granddaughters borrowed and loved it so much, that I bought them one.  They have watched it almost every day for a week.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down and I cannot wait for the next book to come out. I definitely recommend this series.
