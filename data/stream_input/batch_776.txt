B0016HNOXQ|5.0|Again, just mistified by the negative reviews.  People just love to pidgeon hole artists to make the same sounds over and over. Real musicians change, experiment, and challenge listeners.      If you want to hear the same thing over and over, get the next Kitaro record.    I almost didn't get this great album because someone was \\"disappointed\\" in it.  What a mistake that would have been. This is the best Portisehead album, ever. Challenging, moving in different directions, yet still sounding like Portishead.      Best Songs:  Nylon Smile  We Carry On  Machine Gun  Threads    Lay off these bands that are pushing music forward and keep listening to \\"Journey\\" for your sameness fix.
B000KG499M|4.0|The main feature of this display stand is that it has multiple pieces to attach various Gundam figures produced throughout the years.    The arm of the display is highly adjustable that allow it to \\"bend\\" at various angles.  The arm can extend itself to twice it's length a few inches short of a foot while still supporting the Gundam.  The bases can be connected to multiple ones to create a platform to display an entire collection.
B0015XASFS|5.0|I think this DVD is a must purchase for anyone who's seen Josh in concert. I haven't had that good fortune, but this DVD makes me want to.  In addition to the big, lush melodies for which his gorgeous voice is perfectly suited, Josh is also moving in the direction of more modern, edgy music .The DVD version of Canto Alla Vita was a thrilling surprise, with Josh playing on both synthesizer and drums. I love that this talented artist is evolving and creating a unique niche for himself.  Violinist Lucia Micarelli's cover of Led Zepplin's Kashmir is breathtaking on the DVD.  I recently purchased Josh's Awake CD as well--that is, the studio version that was released in late 2006. I recommend it in addition to the DVD, because it has artists not on the DVD, including Ladysmith Black Mambazo on two songs (Lullaby and Weeping) and Herbie Hancock on Machine.
0375704027|3.0|I am a huge Murakami fan, having read Wind-Up Bird, Kafka, After Dark and other works. Maybe it's because I became so enthralled by his \\"unreality\\" that the realism of Norwegian Wood did not captivate me the way his other works have. But that is not to say that this novel is in any way disappointing. As always, it contains the delicate, pensive and musical prose that defines Murakami.
B0006AAS5G|4.0|This is my second Invicta watch, and I am pleased once again.  For $116 (on 6 May 08, but the price has gone up a little) this is a very handsome watch.  As with all Invictas with the brushed outer and polished inner band, be careful if you wear your watch at the computer as the polished center portion is easily scratched.<br /><br />As far as the actual chronograph function goes, I cannot imagine that too many people would be buying a watch like this if they were serious about timing events.
0066620996|1.0|Let's see the results of these great companies...did they even keep up with the general market since this book was publish...no...not only that many are doing abysmally such as Circuit City and Fannie Mae. Even though Jim Collins stood firm against the idea of a 'new economy' and he wisely advocates against high-profile CEOs and golden parachutes, he didn't see the massive bubble that these companies were a part of and that attributed to their 'greatness'. The empirical analysis wasn't really empirical at all and failed to see the hidden assumptions in the research. I recommend potential buyers spend money on a good economics text or course, not on this overrated junk bond of a book.
B0015XASFS|5.0|I have already watched this DVD through twice, and couldn't wait to sit down and write a review. In short, it is absolutely FANTASTIC! The sound quality is perfect (just as good as \\"Josh Groban in Concert\\") and the camera work is terrific (Josh is all over the place, and there are more than enough camera angles to cover him and his band/orchestra.) Josh's voice is incredible, even with all his movement across the stage his voice is strong and lovely.     Highlights for me were:   1. In Her Eyes- if you haven't seen it elsewhere I won't ruin it for you, but I LOVE how he does this and still sounds so perfect!   2. Aurora/Kashmir by Lucia Micarelli- she's fabulous, keep on rockin', Lucia!   3. Pearls (duet with Angelique Kidjo)- a very different and haunting duet, performed perfectly;   4. Un Giorno Per Noi- not really 'pop concert' material, but performed just as beautifully live as in the studio recording;   5. Awake- beautifully done, words slightly changed to fit the circumstances, very emotional!     My only slight disappointment is that most of the fun 'goofy' stuff in between songs is not on the DVD (which is still much longer than the other concert DVDs, so I understand); also, his sweet \\"Not While I'm Around\\" from Sweeney Todd is also missing...     If you have had the chance to go to his concerts or wish you had, do the next best thing and get this DVD/CD. Keep it up, Josh, I will enjoy this and I can't wait for what's next!
076790592X|2.0|I'm sure you've read many reviews on how touching this book is, and I would say 'to each their own'.  But an entire book written about a death-bed conversation can be a bit much for some people.  Think of the scene in 'The Empire Strikes Back' when Yoda is dying and speaking his last words to Luke... well now imagine that scene was the content of the entire movie and you get a sense of what it was like to read this book.  The first half was touching... Morrie - an old college professor was dying, passing on his words of wisdom to his dear ex-student.  Well, by the second half of the book, I just wanted him to pass away so I can finish the book and start another.  I'm sorry, some may say this is blasphemy, but how many tear-jerking eye opening last words of wisdom can you really absorb? And to be honest, I can hardly remember what they were after I closed the book.

1933492279|4.0|This is a great book for anyone looking for inspiration in the creative design field. The renderings were out of this world. I hope to see some of these creations in sci-fi movies in the future. I know the car on the cover is being used in a comercial for Autodesk \\"Digital Prototyping\\"
B0000028RR|5.0|An amazing debut. Rage performed an act of musical alchemy, combining their influences (equal parts Public Enemy, Led Zeppelin & the Sex Pistols) into a frothing beast of rap and rock. It's heavy as hell, it's angry and smart and rabid...and it'll rock your face off.
0143038419|4.0|Her unhappy marriage came to head when she knew she didn't want to follow the \\"script\\" which is imposed on us so much as women: the script that says we need to be wives and mothers. It's a brave thing to admit that you do not want this! The drain of her divorce coupled with her painful split from David is something a lot of women can relate to; who hasn't been through the heartache of a breakup: rollercoaster moods, the phases of anger,the sadness, guilt, fear and lonliness? I found I could relate to her in a lot of ways, but unlike her I do not have the opportunity to travel, so it was fun to travel vicariously through her. Her anecdotes about the people she meets are very amusing, and what better way to feed the body, mind and spirit than the way she has? Hers is a great example to follow!
0385338724|4.0|This is the first Sophie Kinsella book I have read and I really enjoyed it! No it is not Shakespeare but it is a fun entertaining book. I have 3 kids and don;t find too much time to read but this kept my interest! Good read for the summer on the beach!
B0015AARJI|5.0|This controller is the mack daddy of them all. It has the rumble, sixaxis and is of course wireless. It's \\"da bomb.\\" However, I reserve the right to complain on any item and so I will now. The price is obscene for a controller, especially one without a charging cable. Be prepared to pay for the very best now and hope the price comes down in the near future.
B0016HNOXQ|1.0|Not happy, all this time and this is the music? Annouying background and beats...how could this be? Can't believe I even wrote this. Sad.
B00004TWZF|2.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time but sadly I cannot recommend this cut.      Director's cuts are usually either much better or much worse than it's theatrical release sibling but this unfortunatly is the latter.  The story is drawn out  in a confusing and adolescent way and rather than enlightenment we find boredom.  I found myself caring less and less about these people as this mess went on.  The theatrical release moved quickly and clearly.  I knew who these people were and what drove them.  The director's cut left me with none of this.  I found the added scenes a distraction and rather than pushing the story forward they tended to digress from it not leaving you with any new information and subjecting you to more of the VERY BAD soundtrack!     The music in the theatrical release was at least appropriate to the story.  The theatrical release had  soft, wave like earth music that wound you into the ensuing action unlike the Directors cut.  The heavy synthesized jazz score that is plunked down here actually pulls you out of the film.  The scenes become about the irritating 80's jazz rather than the story line.    Sadly, the entire directors cut smacks more of ego on Bessons' part ( refusing to see that the cuts/music in the theatrical release actually made it a better film,) and less of the wonderful story teller which he can be.  I would love to see a Theatrical  version as well on this disc and let the public decide.
B00000J2KT|5.0|\\" Today ... is his birthday...I will never forget this day. The day I came<br />to Hue City and fought one million N.V.A. gooks. I love the little Commie bastards, man, I really do. These enemy grunts are as hard as slant-eyed drill instructors. These are great days we're living, bros!'We are jolly<br />green giants, walking the earth with guns. These people we wasted here today ... are the finest human beings we will ever know. After we rotate back to the world, we're gonna miss not having anyone around that's worth<br />shooting.\\"<br /><br />One of the coldest movie dialogs, i've heard in this movie. It pretty much gave an example of what exactly the whole \\"Killer grunt\\" mode was all about in Vietnam. Instead of cheesy, corny dialog... this was as real as it could get.<br /><br />This film's a masterpiece and the memorable characters being the 'lovable' Drill Instructor Hartman  ... \\"You pukes will sleep with your rifles! You will give your rifle a girl's name! Because this is the only pu#@y you people are going to get! \\"
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I played this CD THREE times in a row when I first heard it, and I can't get enough of it.<br /><br />Confirmed Madonna fans will love this album, and it will most likely win her new fans.  This album=instant party.
B00005JKBC|4.0|The story is about Nathan Muir (Robert Redford), who is a CIA agent on the last day of his job at the 'farm'. He finds out from a fellow agent that one of his protege', Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt) has gone missing in China, presumably on a mission and is captured by the chinese authorities. The senior group at CIA call on Nathan Muir to interview him about Tom Bishop's character so that they can paint a picture of him as a rogue agent with a private agenda, the movie revolves around a series of flashbacks of how Nathan trains Tom Bisop after he discovers him as a scout sniper for a mission, in Vietnam. One of the dialogs at this point was made by Brad Pitt's character when asked about how they put food on the table , \\"No Sir, we had a safeway back home\\" and then eventually for certain reasons, which i don't want to divulge, they are forced to part ways and how Nathan gets Tom out forms the rest of the story.<br /><br />Its fast paced, thrilling, has a romantic angle, with Tom Bishop's love interest in the film, played by Catherine McCormack. Its a very well made spy thriller and rivals on TV movie marathon re-runs only next to 'Clear and Present Danger'.<br /><br />Good movie to add in your collection.<br /><br />Dialog<br />\\"We need this problem, like we need a third tit\\"<br />\\"you using the other two?\\"
B0007OASII|5.0|Anyone who enjoys the sound an lyrics of Queensryche would find Kamelot entertaining to the Nth degree.  I picked them up because I was looking for something with a sound that I enjoy.  I thought they might be something like Nightwish.  This was not the case, but I was not in anyway disappointed.  I found the entire album to be fantastic.  Here we have great sound, vocals, and a very tight band.  At certain points, I almost could imagine that I was listening to a new theme album from Queensryche.    I have only listened to \\"The Black Halo\\" one time.  This album did not take any of the \\"getting used to the sound qualities.\\"  One listen and I was hooked.  There is a story here, but I am not quite sure what it is.  It seems to be about someone who committed a vial act, and he cannot live it down.  If I am wrong, it does not take away from the fact that anyone who enjoys Symphonic Metal will love the tracks on this album.  I could pop this puppy into my car CD player and just listen to it for days.  It is one beautiful piece of work.  Anyone who loves Rock and Roll will find Kamelot a must add to their collection.    There is one member of the backup vocals who has one of those raspy demonic voices, but his backup is minor and in no way diminishes from this instant classic.  We are not talking \\"Morbid Angel\\" here (I am not a fan of noise).  The addition of this demonic voice only adds to the wonderful operatic effect of the overall product.    Kamelot, in one listen, has become a respected group for me, and I look forward to hearing more of their music.  I will most certainly check out their other albums, but for now I cannot more highly recommend \\"The Black Halo.\\"
B000003N89|5.0|Prior to this album, Diana Krall was not considered serious enough as a Jazz singer who could play a mean piano roll. She was a pretty girl, with a pretty voice, who would do standard jazz covers.<br /><br />But this album changed all that, the trio in this record is brilliant and Diana's talent as a vocalist AND a piano player is showcased here in great abundance. It was good for her to choose a tribute album to Nat King Cole, and it results in a very good record and nice interpretations of Nat Cole's classics. It was difficult without a drummer as well<br /><br />I don't have a large collection (50 to 60 CDs ), but this is one cd that i listened to so many items, i scratched it till it could not be played anymore.<br />For me the standout tracks are pretty much all of them<br />special mention though,<br />1. Gee baby...<br />2. Madness<br />3. If i had you<br />4. Frim Fram Sauce<br />5. jive jack..<br /><br />Note: One of the other reviewers here has mentioned a good point, that her current label spends too much time on her image and promoting that aspect of hers. Her talent as a good musician should be developed more.
B000RZGFYS|5.0|ive never heard any slayer material till my manager at work introduced me to slayer's reign in blood last year. this album is awesome.....i love it! i was blown away with the speed, noise, and aggression this album produced. the length of the album is just short.... just 30 minutes. but to me this album has a good definition of what thrash metal is. this album is one of the most influential and a big breakthrough in years to come in the future of metal. ive listened to some of slayer's post rein in blood albums including their recent album christ illusion but for me reign in blood is slayer's finest work ever produced. for those people who want to get in to thrash metal, who want to get into slayer or just plain curious of what thrash metal and slayer sounds like, i would recommend listening to this album. in just 30 minutes and you'll see what i mean!
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|I managed to watch this movie only in bits and pieces, as i was having a hard time to focus because of the camera movement and was getting a headache and a bit nauseous.<br /><br />That fact aside, i thought the movie was a reasonably well made monster flick, although i am a bit old fashioned and looking at some of the special effects if they had done the traditional way of filming, it would have been cool.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|Not only does Johnny look good as Sweeney Todd, but he is such a great actor that I want to watch him over and over again. Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are a perfect duo just like in other movies they've done together. Tim Burton does such a good job with this movie!!!
B00005JLWN|5.0|First off, this tendency for comparing this film to the Matrix should cease. I feel that Equilibrium is a under-rated movie and deserves more of a better rating, i was surprised to discover that this movie came out in 2002, i heard about it only last year!<br />I enjoyed watching the \\"Gun Kata\\" fight sequences and Christian Bale kicking pretty much everybody's rear with a Katana Sword.<br />As far as the story goes, although there is nothing ground breaking, it was directed reasonably well, without being excessively cheesy and Chrisitan Bale as usual rocks.<br /><br />Recommend to own. Good Movie.<br /><br />---\\"Now the who the devil is Mr. Yochum ???\\"-- (check the last three reviewers)
B00005JPS7|5.0|I don't even know where to begin the describe how great the film is. Rober Downey Jr. is an excellent actor and he truely shined as Tony Spark. His character grows and develops throughout the film and the ending (sit through the credits) promises a new beginning.     The only thing that could've been better is another actress instead of Gwyneth Paltrow. Even though she previously won an Oscar, she is pretty bland and unimpressive as Tony's love interest.

B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|What would you do if you could see into your immediate future?<br /><br />This is a concept movie that actually works very well on a number of levels. Admittedly, the ending can be feel like a cop out to many viewers, but it actually is very much in keeping with the general theme of the movie. Accept it for what it is and it's really not that bad an ending.<br /><br />Cage is, as always, very laid back in his portrayal, but that works very well for him. His magician persona works best when he gives no tell of what he is planning or what he has seen in the future.<br /><br />To put this in proper context, this movie is inspired by a short story by Philip K Dick, who wrote the stories that spawned \\"Total Recall\\", \\"Blade Runner\\", \\"A Scanner Darkly\\", \\"Paycheck\\" and \\"Minority Report\\".
0385338082|3.0|I do agree this is a very easy read and at times interesting. The story line is witty but I found it dull at times. It was like being on a roller coaster ride with thrilling highs and boring lows. There were several times I couldn't put the book down and thought \\"this is amazing\\" only to have the excitement crash into utter doldrums. Leaving me feeling let down. I wouldn't dissuade anyone from reading this because it has some great elements and is an easy read but I wouldn't encourage you to rush out and buy it.
B000HCO83Q|3.0|This outing for our mutant friends is disappointing on so many levels. The film makers have clearly lost track of just what it is that made the first two movies so great. One of the great things that Bryan Singer did with those movies was to, ironically, humanize the mutants.<br /><br />Yes, they have amazing powers, but the movies worked best when they treated the use of those powers as just routine. Ice Man blowing on Wolverine's soda to chill it. Magneto simulating the kinetic ball toy on his desktop. These things were done with hardly any fanfare. But it's a far cry from this movie where, every single time Storm decides to use her power, they do a zoom-in to her eyes to remind you they turn white when she exerts herself.<br /><br />We know they're mutants. We know they're super-human. We need to also feel they're human. If the audience can't connect with the heroes, there's no point.<br /><br />**Warning - Minor Spoilers**<br /><br />Add to that the fact that they decided to kill off too many of the big names--and largely without real reason within the story--and the movie not only disappoints, but ends up offending fans of those characters.
0143038419|4.0|This is a book that I wouldn't actively promote to my friends but it was a nice read and I am glad I read it. Very quick and easy read. If you are looking for something light to read in between books this would be a good choice. Definitely a girl book and don't think many men would find this enjoyable.
B000UR9T8C|4.0|Now THIS is the way a superhero movie is supposed to be done! First of all, I was fairly impressed by the way \\"Sandman\\" was done, though they portrayed him a little too sympathetically, as opposed to the way he was played in the magazine originally. In the original story introducing the character, he was given the standard, smarmy villain's personality....snarling, sassing Spidey whenever he could, threatening ....but in the movie, he's almost always silent as he fights Spiderman...and what FIGHTS!! Boy...Petey didn't like him much, did he?<br /><br />Anyway, as far as I'm concerned, THIS is the Spidey flick Roger Ebert should have saved his \\"best superhero flick\\" praise for, (it really IS the best of the Spiderman movies, but none of the Spidey flicks is \\"the best superhero movie EVER....\\") Jolly Jonah is the best he's ever been portrayed, live action, Topher Grace was a convincing proto-yuppie as Eddie Brock and all the drama and comedy relief was well done. And is it just me, or was Mary Jane's singing pretty much perfect in that dress rehearsal? Those producers had tin ears!<br /><br />There's a nod to \\"Daredevil\\" in the middle of the film, where Brock actually prays to the Almighty in a church, (while Spidey is there with his \\"Venom\\" coating,) to \\"kill Peter Parker\\" after Parker reveals him as a fraud in the Daily Bugle newsroom. Brock also eventually finds out Peter is Spiderman, so things get hairy from then on. A pattern is made rather obvious as Mary Jane is again used as a pawn in a game of death near the climax of the film. However, this is still handled well, and is a little tenser than the school bus scene in the first Spidey film.<br /><br />All in all, if you thought something was missing from the first \\"Spiderman\\" film, as I did, THIS one makes up for it! Rent it, or buy it, and enjoy!
0553383663|3.0|I think this book is great, I have to say I devoured it which means that it keeps a great flow.  However, I think it lacked some unanswered questions, seems a bit pro-Google, and it lacked a final chapter. In short, it needs a strong editorial review which would have send the authors back to the drawing board to polish some details.  1.- One constant question: How did Google managed to cope with the computer power on a constant growing demand (they broadly speak about a computing law) - this is critical to Google being fast.  2.- When it speaks about the Google Earth it fails to mention how did Google manage to get those pictures from NASA.  3.-  When it talks about News Google it fails to speak about the lawsuit that was lost in Belgium where Google had to take down many newspapers and allegedly banned Le Soir and other publishers from the searchengine.  4.- There are many parties who claim that Google has destroyed their business by banning them without a reasonable explanation (include reference to Google Watch). It should include Game words such when \\"Bill Gates\\" showed strange results. Though si fair to say that the chapter Trick Click does cover the core critic to its ad revenue.  6.- More importantly, the last chapter talks about DNA (and other stuff). They should have decided either to split this chapter and add a conclusion. Is just frustrating as a reader not to know what should one expect from Google in the future: will Google become Evil through Cloud Computing and other long crawling spiders? What should it await Google?  These authoritative writers should be able to wonder in such answers.  7.- Finally, -yes  - unfortunately updating is needed in such as fast changing world. Is justified, because of the popularity of this book. So do add a note to the European Parliament's report on Google, Cloud Computing and its venture in the mobile world (or maybe write a second book Google II?).    Enjoy reading this book,    Sergio
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I wish Radiohead would stop putting out masterpiece after masterpiece. They're really starting to become predictable. :) What great things can I say about this album that haven't already been said? Stellar as usual.

B000FTWB7G|1.0|I REALLY wish I had read the comments before purchasing.     Having been a fan since \\"Fallen\\", I thought that maybe  I would enjoy another great album. I love Amy Lee's   voice...Well this one was \\"the WORST music I have ever  heard.\\"    The loud \\"Metalica like music\\" is all you hear. You can not  hear a word of what Amy Lee is saying in her lyrics.     Every single song is just awful.     I am SO disappointed.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Ahhhhh, what a wonderful film. Once again, Pixar and Disney have made a true family film well worth watching, with funny (and smart) dialogue, lovable characters and well-casted voice talent, not to mention very original ideas for the plot and a good villain (I don't mean that the villain is a good guy, I mean that the villain's villainy makes him a good villain in a villainous way.)<br /><br />A very good DVD to have on your shelf, no matter how old you are.
1416955070|4.0|Ok I'll admit it I knew the ending before even picking up this book. Perhaps it was know the edning that I didn't think it was as bad as these reviewers are making it out to be! It was a departure from badly written, 1 demensional characters, under developed plot that Clare's bff Holly Black put out that everyone's comparing the book to. The one huge complaint I have is that it was amazingly predicatble. But I didn't predict everything and I liked the characters(especially Luke!)and the huge mixture of mythological creatures. Will be picking up City of Ashes.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Alright. My name is Wally Gator and I am into rock and roll. And be that as it may, that Madonna primarily puts out dance records, I always feel that I need to engulf myself in everything she does, and write reviews about my experiences as I get lost in her Madonna-centric world.<br />The one thing I noticed about this album though that I wasn't to cool with were the outside appearences by Justin and Tiberland. I was not impressed by these guest spots at all. Madonna-centric is the key. When I pushed play on track one, everything was good. I closed my eyes and drifted away. There was my Madge doing sexy struts, with huge lollypops and whatnot. Next thing you knew, we were riding through the sky naked on a flying pony and everything was wonderful throughout the opening track. But just as everything was getting great, the Justin Timberlake portion of 4 Minutes kicks in. And suddenly he's sitting behind me on the pony too, and I am completely freaked out and I jump out of my fantasy world in a panic! NO!!!!<br />A little bit shaken, I still want to keep the dream rolling, so I take a breath, try to clear the image from my mind and move on. The next track brings me back to form, now I am wearing a baby bonnet and milking on Madonnas beautiful breasts as she sings tender songs to me like HEARTBEAT and SHES NOT ME. I am in a state of well being and the stress has eased away  ..but then Timberland!!!! What are you doing here!!!...Get out, get out, GET OUT!! The point is, that I want to hear Madonna only. I wanna feel like theres no one in the room but me and her. I don't want to be listening to the headache inducing sounds of Timberland and Justin...yuck. Maybe if it was Christina Aguilera or something I'd be alright with it, but...<br />anyway... duh, I'm addicted. Madonna is still burned into my dreams, and as the album closes and gets down to some crazy danceable cuts, that sort of sound like a wild mix of her earliest works, her erotica days and something new, as performed by a Madge whos crazier and skankier than ever, slugging booze and smacking me around like whoa, I am as usual one rock and roller who is stupified by that very sexy kitten. &lt;3 you Madonna! &lt;3 you forever!a Madge whos crazier and skankier than ever, slugging booze and smacking me around like whoa, I am as usual one rock and roller who is stupified by that very sexy kitten. <3 you Madonna! <3 you forever!
B00079FUI6|2.0|Why is our culture glorifying adultery, violence and murder by giving this show so much acceptance? The first season episodes has a murder with a blender pitcher, an elderly man murdered by his wife and kept in a deep freeze, Teri Hatcher locked out of her house without any clothes on--yet justice has never punished anyone except Carlos, the poor Mexican American who's kind to his mom. And of course scenes from season one repeat every year in best moments from old shows episodes--I guess the writers ran out of perfect murders in the plot that week.  To top it all off the \\"wives\\" are pictured as kind parents to their kids. It would've given Walt Disney a heart attack Sunday night if he were alive today.
0060899190|5.0|\\"Some of the most beautiful postcards in this collection came from very painful feelings and memories. I believe that each of us has the ability to discover, share, and grow our own dark secrets into something meaningful and beautiful.\\" ~ Frank Warren<br /><br />There are some things you wouldn't even tell your best friend. Instead, you might consider telling Frank by sending him a creative postcard. What started off as an idea for a community art project has morphed into numerous books.<br /><br />Some of the postcards show a sense of humor, while others show a dark side inspired by people's psychological pain. You may be shocked by some of the vindictive thoughts or even surprised by your own emotional response to the honesty in the messages. Here are a few I can actually include in a review (others are too private to post):<br /><br />\\"I put coins in other people's parking meters.\\"<br />\\"I am home-less and no one (not even my family) knows about it.\\"<br />\\"I give decaf to customers who are rude to me.\\"<br /><br />One thing I know for sure is that some people have given me regular coffee instead of decaf! In this book such a dark side is now revealed.<br /><br />This book is a fairly quick read because most of the postcards have just a few sentences. Most of the postcards are artistic and represent the feelings and moods of the writer. That is what makes so many of them unique. While reading I had thoughts about sending in a postcard with my own secrets. This book is sure to inspire you in such a direction.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
0194001067|5.0|My friend bought this dictionary, and I quickly followed suit.  It gives concise definitions that are easy to understand, and it's the right size for my nightstand (not too big, but big enough to have a huge # of words).  My friend said the CD is great, too, but I haven't used it yet.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This is what all \\"Nature Films\\" should strive to achieve. Perfection in scope, subject and photography.  High Definition got raw deal.
B00113N6KQ|4.0|Yes, this movie is completely over the top. That's the point !!!!!!!!!! The film is a caricature of action films. The action hero is named \\"Mr. Smith.\\" The hooker has a heart of gold. The body count is enormous! They have a baby in a bulletproof vest!!! I have no idea how anyone could take this movie seriously. You aren't supposed to!!! If you love action movies, and have a good sense of humor, you will enjoy this movie. This movie is great fun. I laughed my *ss off! And Clive Owen is seriously hot!!! (and for the guys.... Monica Bellucci is beautiful.)
141694740X|5.0|oh my gosh, girls!  after being divorced 10 years and confused about men, and confused as to why i was still single, this book was a HUGE wakeup call for me, it just hit me.  i now knew what to do and how to react/behave in certain situations.  and not to wonder over and over again \\"should i make some sort of gesture to let him know i'm interested,\\" \\"is he interested in me?\\"  \\"should i call him?\\"  yeah.....no!  i read this book and liked it so much i listened to the CDs and TOOK NOTES.  i hadn't intended to take notes.  i was cleaning the house one day and listening to it and some things just hit me.  so much so that i paused the CD several times to take notes.<br /><br />and at the risk of sounding dramatic or naive, with the exception of the Bible, this is THE MOST HELPFUL and practical book i've ever read!  greg made it so clear and obvious when to know a guy is into you.  so much so that i felt an enormous amount of peace and felt so differently about \\"finding\\" someone, about constantly searching, literally looking for, scoping out men after that.  i just didn't care anymore.  i would know when the right one came along and whether or not he was interested in  me, instead of pushing for a relationship. i was not going to waste my time wondering about someone's feelings for me.<br /><br />if you've been single for a long time, i really think you will find this book useful.  i think it can save women a LOT of time and also from making fools of ourselves like i did MANY times.  don't waste your time on him:  if he is interested he will let you know and you will have little doubt.<br /><br />i don't necessarily believe in the adage/cliche \\"when you stop looking you will find someone,\\" even though i recently got married, after not caring anymore about men.  i stopped guessing whether or not they liked me. because of this book i was able to have that peace, an overwhelming sense of peace, actually.  in hindsight, when my husband and i were dating, there was no doubt in my mind that he was \\"into me.\\"  he let me know all the time by his words and actions.  and he wasn't afraid to talk about commitment.  that didn't scare him at all b/c he was crazy about me.<br /><br />best wishes and peace.\\"into me.\\"  he let me know all the time by his words and actions.  and he wasn't afraid to talk about commitment.  that didn't scare him at all b/c he was crazy about me.    best wishes and peace.

B0015D3Z4O|4.0|First off, don't ever judge a book by it's cover, or in this case, an album by it's cover. Madonna is near 50 (at the time of this review) and she has a ridiculously fantastic body but the cover...But inside Hard Candy, her final album for Warner Bros, delivers the treats that it promises. Not so much in the opening, \\"Candy Shop\\", which is ambitious but it seems a bit out of touch. \\"My sugar is raw\\", Madonna chants. Its sure to give Madonna haters some ammunition, but for anyone who is a big enough Madonna fan, they will see it as just a fun, innuendo-driven introduction to the rest of the \\"sticky and sweet\\" offerings. Trust me, it gets better. Of course, there is lead single \\"4 Minutes\\" with Justin Timberlake and while it's still to be determined whether or not it will be up there with classics like \\"Vogue\\" and \\"Music\\", it's a frantic, of the moment powerhouse of a pop song. The rest follows suit, a more urban sound, reminiscent of 1994's Bedtime Stories, except it's not interested in relaxing at all. Blending that album's R&B/Hip Hop sensibilities with 2000's looser Music and some of the disco grooves of 2005's Confessions on a Dance Floor, Hard Candy is one of Madonna's most accessible and fun records to date. It's fast paced, mostly wants to party, on such killer dance songs as next single \\"Give it 2 Me\\" and \\"Heartbeat\\", two tracks you'll likely see on upcoming greatest hits albums. \\"Miles Away\\" showcases Madonna's recent infatuation with a semi-folk meets pop sound. That trick worked on Music, had mixed results on American Life and is brilliantly tweaked, thanks to Timbaland's production this time around. Whether or not it's Madonna's own experience with \\"long distance love\\", it's got classic Madonna written all over it. Which seems to be the concern for many. Why has Madonna gotten top name producers rather than obscure ones? Can she pull off an urban makeover? \\"Miles Away\\" is the best example of Madonna's ability to take even the most present of pop and making it her own. Those who are saying she's taking a backseat are only half right. Sure, we have Pharell Williams, Timbaland, and Justin Timberlake. But doesn't it seem fitting that they work with such an icon when they have accomplished so much themselves? I don't think taking a more mainstream approach ruins Madonna's signature style at all. Madonna sounds so much fresher than on her last record, which was a great return to dance roots but didn't quite make it all the way there. Here, she doesn't try so hard. It's as if we get Madonna past, present and future all on one record. \\"Incredible\\" is a superb Madonna track and among my favorites. I dare you to try to get it out of your head. \\"Can't get my head around, I need to think about it\\" Madonnna sings like she's on a major sugar buzz. It's sleek, funky and slightly campy which makes it one of the songs that works the best. Whoever Madonna is talking about on \\"She's Not Me\\" better watch out because some we get some of that old fashioned sass on that one. \\"She might cook you breakfast, or love you in the shower, the flavor of the moment, but she don't have what's ours, she's not me..\\" she snarls.  I know many people dislike \\"Spanish Lesson\\", but I think it's really cute and takes her back to familiar terriory with the theme, though it's no \\"La Isla Bonita\\". One of the best songs is \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\", a dramatic, operatic f-you, which reminds some of Justin's \\"Cry Me a River\\". I can see the resemblance, but who cares? It's an awesome song and has enough weight of it's own to stand apart from Justin's. Like all Madonna records, people will find something to complain about regardless. Closer \\"Voices\\" is a darker, off kilter song that is very interesting and a nice break off from the bright and fun pop of the rest of the album. \\"Who is the Master? Who is the Slave?\\" Justin asks at the start. Somehow it ties everything together very nicely. Some might say Madonna once was the master but now is the slave and nolonger a trendsetter. I totally disagree. Madonna's music has blazed many trails, but she is also inspired by other artists as well and theres nothing wrong with that. As long as her stuff is as sweet as Hard Candy, I'll keep running to the record store on Madonna Tuesdays. Madonna fans should be rejoicing.
0439813786|5.0|The Invention of Hugo Cabret is a visually stunning, compelling story I am already thinking about re-reading. The book is different than many I've read in this age range because it opens with a series of beautiful, text-less drawings (almost like a David Wiesner book), but they are set in a novel format more similar to a large, later Harry Potter book. The book is a fast read as it alternates between the drawings and a few pages of text. It makes for an interesting affect as you become engrossed in the story, and then walk through the drawings almost like you are seeing a silent movie of climactic action in each chapter.<br /><br />Writing-wise, I also thought the story lived up to a high caliber. Like many good stories, The Invention of Hugo Cabret does a great job of giving the reader lots to wonder about in the beginning that fuel the reader's interest through the 500+ pages of this tome. I literally could not put the book down for the first 300 because I was constantly wondering how key plot questions would be resolved and when certain secrets would be revealed.<br /><br />All-in-all, a unique, creative, and engaging book. Don't let it's size scare you!
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Never liked the poppy upbeat depeche mode as much as the intellectual, sometimes dark and gloomy depeche mode.   Much more suiting to Gahan's brooding vocal style.
1416950176|4.0|This first book in the Spiderwick Chronicles was a fun, quick read. Although smacking a little bit of Lemony Snicket (three kids with unique skills and parent-abandonment issues), it is definitely worth a read. The presentation of the book, at least the edition I read, is nice too as the artwork parallels the tone of the text. This lends the book a definite ethos that although not as profound as some books (again like Lemony Snicket), it is distinct and engaging.<br /><br />As an adult reader, I did find the book a tad too easy to breeze through, but I could see this same aspect of the book being exactly why it is so approachable for children. For my own kids, I would steer them towards something a little more cerebral, but I wouldn't object to them reading the Spiderwick Chronicles as well for fun.<br /><br />The first book definitely encouraged me to read the second, if not the entire series!
B00133KFGW|5.0|I love this movie.  It just makes you believe in the music of the earth and love.
0307265730|4.0|Jumpha Lahiri is undoubtedly a brilliant writer.  The Namesake and Interpreter of Maladies were fantastic.  I do agree with two of the criticisms made by other readers.  1) Compared to her earlier works, she seems to have developed a more melodramatic style that seems contrived.  It was more like reading Chitra Banerjee Divikaruni (who I enjoy because Ms. Divikaruni writes melodrama quite naturally by the way)--it seemed forced from Ms. Lahiri.  2) I also agree that the characters lacked variety after a while.  The characters were definitely not as engaging as her prior works.  Nontheless, she is brilliant and engaging.
B000X418UE|5.0|Lots of Action! Classic Bruckheimer! Music keeps you on edge. Great ending. Okay the plot is a streach but fun to watch!
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|The Greatest Hits  is the best album yet! The best song is Man I Feel Like a Woman.  I discovered this song on the radio and this was the first time I had ever heard Shania and I loved and  that is how I discovered Shania Twain. I love all of the songs on the album.  Shania rocks!! You will love her if you have never listened to her and you will love this album if you have never heard it.  Highly recommanded album!!
0440237688|4.0|Title: The Giver  Author: Lois Lowry  Number of pages: 192  Level:  6th-8th grade reading level  Genre:  Science Fiction  Synopsis of Plot:  Jonas is a young boy, turning twelve at the beginning of the story.  He has grown up in a fictional community where there is no crime, violence, poverty, or \\"memories\\" of the past.  He has only know this eutopia, where there is only happiness, feelings are constantly shared, and everything is very well organized and planned out.  There are very strict rules that guide daily life in the community.  Every member of the community follows the same life plan, where no one chooses a husband or wife.  Rather, couples are matched up, children are chosen to go to certain homes after being born by \\"birth mothers,\\" and each home is only allowed two children for population control.  There are no choices to be made, but Jonas soon finds out that he will be faced with one as he turns twelve, a very important age in the community.  At age twelve, every child is given a job that they will hold for the rest of their lives.  Jonas receives the most important job in the community: Receiver of Memories.  He is given memories and knowledge of the world as we know it now, by an Elder in the community called \\"The Giver.\\"  Jonas learns of pain, of war, of weather, freedom, animals, color, family, and all of the things he has grown up not knowing.  He realizes that choices can be made, and that life doesn't have to follow this dull, empty-of-joy pattern.    Negative Aspects:  The only negative aspects I have seen after reading this book many times, is that there are some dark sides to the book that some children may not be able to understand.  For example, euthanizing and infant may be difficult for some children to understand, and also the scene where war-fare is described.  The only other negative aspect that I could see, is that though the book is fictional, there are many aspects of the book that go unexplained.  The community lives in this \\"ideal,\\" world, but no one ever explains how they got to where they are, with no memories, or color, or what happened to the rest of the world before \\"sameness.\\"  My Rating:  I give The Giver 4 stars personally.  I have read the book numerous times, as well as having read it to my class.  The book is a quick read, and never felt boring.  It really gave students insight to what the world would be like without family, choices, pain, or joy.  It was interesting, and brought up a lot of great discussions in class.  It presented many ideas that I had never thought of before.  The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars, is the same reason I stated before.  The book is fictional, but still needs to provide some type of explanation of how the community that Jonas grew up in, came to be.  This would help readers to fully understand the history behind the book, and understand the choices that the people in the community had made.    Overall, I would recommend this book for most middle-school students who are able to read at this level.  It's an interesting book that really challenges the thought of what a community is, individual thinking, and how rules can affect everyday life
B00005JMAH|4.0|I loved all the books and most of the movies. Big Harry Potter fan, but my 6-year old son enjoyed the 1st movie but was scared of the 2nd, 3rd, the end of the 4th, and the 5th. This and \\"Goblet of Fire\\" is my favorite of the Harry Potter movies so far. This movie tells more about Harry's parents and how they died. Cute, funny, and sad all at the same time.

B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Bought it instead of renting. Big mistake. It's like the Blair Witch Trials. The camera shakes the whole time, people running and screaming, and you have no clue what is going on. The graphics suck. The story part would have been great if more info was included. Who is going to hold on to a camera the whole time your running from a giant monster? Whether you are 50 feet in the air or being attacked in a dark subway while creatures is attacking you. Not to mention that the camcorder is like the tuffest camcorder of all time and with a super battery LOL. No camcorder is going to withstand that kind of drama and the battery would not last an entire night and next morning. Kind of stupid but just my opinion. Would watch if extremly bored but not worth $16.99 that I paid for it.
0521664357|5.0|This vocabulary guide is excellent.  The format is very easy to use and very accessible.  I am an ESL teacher and am always looking for more vocabulary for my students and exercises to go with that new vocabulary and this book covers both.  If you like the English Grammar in Use books, you'll love this one.<br /><br />The only thing I would change is that I would probably get the intermediate level instead. Although my students are advanced, this level is a little bit challenging for them.
B00003CWPL|1.0|I first rented Eraserhead back in the early eighties on the recommendation of someone. Later that year I visited him in the asylum but didn't bother asking why (he considered this movie worth watching). I just assumed it had something to do with bad acid. Nevertheless in the late eighties I rented it again determined that there must be something to this movie I wasn't appreciating. In the late nineties my girlfriend threw it into our basket for an all night viewing of the worst movies ever made. It was last on the list and we had mercifully passed out in each other's arms before even plugging it in the machine. Somewhere around 2001 it showed up on television. I turned it off and went to bed.    There is something unique about Eraserhead in that no matter what category or classification you put it, no matter what angle you view it from and no matter what you compare it to... it stinks! It really is the product of a pathetically sick mind that should be occupied with anything but writing or producing movies. Perhaps flipping burgers is more up David Lynch's alley but please... don't let it be at a restaurant in my city!    Rating this movie a zero it would be much too lenient. Total junk!
0688014291|2.0|Blanchard and Johnson's The One Minute Manager presents a novel, yet simplistic perspective for corporate management. The authors tell a very boring and manufactured story in order to present a \\"new and exciting\\" form of management.  The author's stress honesty, shared sense of responsibility and dialog between boss and employee.  In order to keep this flow of communication open the manager must engage in three tools or secrets.   First, the employee must submit and record a one-minute, one-page set of goals.  The manager asks how and when the goals will be achieved and helps to define success in the situation.  The end result will be compared to the initial goal setting sheet in order to identifying the goal achieved or failed.  This exercise puts the boss and employee on the same page about the true responsibilities of the employee.    The second secret is one-minute praising.  When an employee does something right they are immediately praised for a minute.  This furthers the employee's understanding of quality work because there is an immediate validation or rejection in their work.  Employees strive to be praised and repeated good habits become second nature for the employees.    The third secret is the One Minute Reprimand.  When an employee does something wrong they are to be reprimanded for a minute.  The manager informs the employee that they are doing something wrong.  The problem is specifically defined and explained.  The manager explains the problems in the action but does not attack the employee specifically.  The manager must then remember to praise the employee to remind them that they are valued and respected.   Though this form is of management is innovative it is not a groundbreaking concept.  Open lines of communication and specific goals are not new theories of organization, but they are effective tools.  This book does a good job of explaining a couple tools to improve communication but still is not worth reading.
B00008AWOD|4.0|On \\"Sleeping With Ghosts\\" Placebo presents an interesting musical melange of androgynous post-punk glam rock with very good musicianship (and very creative use of electronic and digital instruments and effects) and exceptionally strong lyrics. The instrumental work on the album is worth listening to repeatedly, and the songs are intelligent, though generally dark.<br /><br />I was very taken with the lyrics on the CD, especially \\"The Bitter End\\". While the lyrics are themselves cutting and brilliant, the vocals from Brian Molko are perfectly suited to the material and contribute markedly to the edginess of the final album. The best song on the album is, by far, \\"Protect Me From What I Want\\" which is a bleak, haunting, brilliant, and beautiful piece of music. I love the instantaneous and wholly unexpected ending they chose for the song, which reminded me of \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" from Abbey Road. It is an auditory choice that can't be made very often, but here it works perfectly (as it did for the Beatles) and counterpoints the stark and sinusoid nature of the song, while the guitar and drum interplay (and overdubs) are brilliantly executed making this my favorite Placebo song.<br /><br />This is a great effort from Placebo, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a thoughtful yet edgy musical experience.
B0000256KE|5.0|Roxy Music from 1972 through 1975 or so was a fascinating and deeply important band that was bursting with so much talent that implosion seemed inevitable. Band members either left (Eno), became slowly marginalized (Andy Mackay, Phil Manzanera), or were fired (Paul Thompson), so that primary songwriter/vocalist Bryan Ferry could streamline (and eventually dilute) his concept without any bothersome dissent. But back in those heady early days it was Roxy (along with The New York Dolls) that seemed to be the first important bands not just formed in the new decade, but truly OF the 1970s, however obviously  influenced and by high and popular cultural movemts from romantic poetry to Surf music they may have been. From the start, with a name that deliberately evoked the cinematic, the group's immersion in everything from Dirk Bogarde to Humphrey Bogart, Hollywood and the visual arts (Francis Bacon to fashion magazines); the music was richly allusive, yet strikingly original from their seminal debut, and one hears strains Cuban, doo-wop, Brecht/Weil, Harry Partch, The Velvet Underground, and Stockhausen, to name a random few.  Roxy took the Stones' rejection of the 'sincere' everyman personae rock and pop stars, from Dylan to Elvis and Johnny Rotten, had been most comfortable with to a more perverse conclusion. Ferry was fascinated with irony, distance, surfaces, and the band's music was both edgy and glossy, infectious and cutting edge, but unlike most bands comning out of the early '70s they were no no more steeped in blues than Fred Asdtaire; and they surely emphasized Astaire if only because that kind of style was such an anomaly in rock and roll at the time.  \\"Roxy Music\\", their 1972 debut, may be richer and more allusive, but the band had a better grasp on making records - and a real producer in Chris Thomas - by \\"For Your Pleasure\\" which may be, along with 1974's \\"Stranded\\", their greatest achievement. Back then everything from the font used on the cover to the black-on-black artwork to the band photos inside the gatefold were deliberate, a little fruity, fresh, and  unsettling (and often dismissed, especially in the US where the Doobie Bros dominated the radio telling us to 'Listen to the Music' and Loggins & Messina seemed no more frisky than Jim Croce singing 'Your Mama Can't Dance (and Your Daddy Won't Rock 'n' Roll).'  Roxy - both more intellectual and more unabashedly 'pop' - were far less accessable in those days, before the likes of Duran Duran and other 'new romantics' smoothed out Roxy's rough edges and dominated the '80s. Roxy seemed both populist and elitist, but were really neither.  Every song here is essential, and the album is brilliantly sequenced. There were no singles excerpted, but side one kicks off the closest thing to a hit: Ferry, affects fey, lounge-lizard persona, utterly lacking in innocence or youth. Yet somehow he steals the Malt Shop Talent Show by lathering the room with his vibrato and stiff-limbed (as I imagined, two years before seeing the band live) demonstrations of dance crazes of yore, from the waltz to the mashed potato to the watusi; rejecting all as passe, the singer implores us to \\"Do The Strand\\"; the band rocks out convincingly, in their deliberately robotic yet funky way.    Ferry's piano seems as jittery as his vocals, even on the slow ones like the carefully written melodramas 'Strictly Confidential' and 'Beauty Queen', and the side's climactic ode to artifice, 'In Every Dream Home A Heartache,' a more menacing piece of music than the Doors ever recorded. Eno's tape manipulations created textures that are essential to the sound of this album, and even if he wrote no songs for ther band - to it's detriment, for I can hear the band romping through 'Cindy Tells Me' or 'Needles In The Camel's Eye' along with 'EWditions Of You' - he was Ferry's perfect foil; Manzanera and Mackay are both self-effacing yet highly sophisticated musicians, essential to the band's image and sonic identity,adding grit and futuristic soul throughout. The long cuts on side two are as hypnotic as they're intended to be. If Ferry peaked as a lyricist on \\"Stranded\\", Roxy Music, meaning the original band with a collective vision based on Ferry's masterplan, never came close to the grand heights achieved on \\"For Your Pleasure.\\"
B0000C8AQM|5.0|This soundtrack for \\"School of Rock\\" delivers on every level: the song selection is great, the original dialogue excerpts are amusing, and the sound quality is near perfect. The classics included cross most genres and include extremely well known monster hits like Led Zeppelin's \\"Immigrant Song\\" and lesser known, though brilliant, works like \\"Ballrooms of Mars\\" by T-Rex. The only thing on the disc I could have done without is \\"T. V. Eye\\" by Wylde Ratttz.<br /><br />Equal to the originals for entertainment value were the original cast recordings of \\"School of Rock\\" and especially the fabulous and funny cover version of \\"It's a Long Way to the Top\\", which is a personal favorite of mine.<br /><br />There are a few oddities that don't seem to fit on the soundtrack, \\"Edge of Seventeen\\" foremost among them, but after seeing the movie their presence makes perfect contextual sense. I enjoyed this CD far more than I expected to, and I recommend it to music fans or fans of the movie without reservation.
B000QEIOTO|5.0|I love this trilogy.  I bought the 3 movies in HD DVD, but i was dissapointed when I found that none comes with spanish subtitles, and the page tells the opposite.  Whatever, I like so much this 3 movies.
B00023B1LC|5.0|I don't have time to review this exhaustively, but want to be as thorough as I can.  I'm also working under the assumption that you are interested in \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" and \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" as well as this, the first movie in one of the best trilogies ever made.  Opinions as to which movie is the best are well within the limits of personal taste; for me, this movie is the second best behind \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\"; however, like the Beethoven symphonies, one of a great set has to be the least.    TBI starts in the middle of the sea; the Mediterranean, we find out soon enough.  An Italian fishing boat finds a body left for dead in the middle of the night.  The ship's surgeon is skilled and equipped sufficiently to remove some bullets and, in the process, fish out a diode that blinks what appears to be a Swiss bank number.  The man, an American (Matt Damon, of course) regains consciousness, realizing that for the time being, he is among friends.  He is able to remember how to speak, dress, play chess, read, and other daily skills, but has no idea how he ended up in the Mediterranean, much less shot, wearing a wetsuit, or anything else; he cannot even remember his name.  Eventually, the fishermen leave him ashore with a small stipend to get to the Swiss bank, where the man finally learns what his name must have been -- Jason Bourne -- but not much help with who he is, except that he has a ton of cash, a portfolio of fake passports, and a gun.  Except for the gun, he takes the treasure on his journey to find out more about Jason Bourne, no longer able to find buddies like the fishermen -- the Swiss police and the American Embassy security are both interested in detaining him, if not worse.  His last friend is Maria, who gives him a ride to Paris for $10,000 so he can  put together clues from his last known address.  Meanwhile, some American federal agency (CIA? FBI? NSA? the issue doesn't press front and center) is trying to fix something that went wrong with Bourne.  By \\"fix\\", we get the idea that keeping Bourne alive is not a high priority with the feds.    TBI was the only Bourne movie directed by Doug Liman, rather than Paul Greengrass.  So we don't have the latter's hand-held camera sequences, and that's good and bad.  The hand to hand combat scenes are a little less intense, but easier to watch.  The car chase in Paris is top-notch.    My favorite part about TBI, and the other Bourne movies (or this new species of action movies, in general), is the dichotomy between the policy wonks, surrounded by their computer geeks in monitor-loaded command centers capable of generating impossible intelligence (apparently every intersection in Europe is now covered by a remote camera, no matter how remote) and the rubber-hits-the-road robot assassins, each receiving his assignments by way of a video cell-phone that was probably a bit hipper in 2002 than I'm remembering.  For me, TBI belongs to Conklin (Chris Cooper), Bourne's trainer and supervisor, and apparently the one with the most to lose now that Jason is making noise all over Europe.  He reports to another fine spook, Abbott (Brian Cox), but Conklin just gets me with his short-sleeve dress shirts and ties that make him look like an aluminum-siding salesman.  I got the idea Conklin never did grasp the depth of the hole he'd fallen into, especially when he told Abbott \\"We will burn for this,\\" and Abbott has an expression on his face like Tonto thinking \\"Whaddya you mean we, Kimosabe?\\"    Besides Abbott and Costello (I mean Conklin), there are some other good supporting performances, with not a lot of lines, from the other assassins.  Of course, we know none of them can be as good as Jason, but cleaning up Jason involves some messy work.  The best of a good group is Clive Owen as the \\"professor\\"; probably his last role this small, he foreshadows questions Jason will ask in the future movies.  But the best other character is Maria (Franka Potente), whose action chops can't bedoubted by anyone who's seen \\"Run Lola Run\\".  Her instinct to trust Bourne when her life depends on it is spot-on, and when you see her buckle up her seat-belt, you might want to make sure your own doors are locked.    The Bourne Identity is a slick, solid, well-written action flick, and is great both standing on its own and as the first movie of a great trilogy.
B00005NMXI|5.0|Each and every time I play this box set, I am blown away by the stark poetic brilliance of Townes Van Zandt's writing and the simple, pure and unique sound of his voice.  Although best known for his iconic compositions, If I Needed You and Pancho & Lefty, there are few, if any, of his songs which do not startle with their vivid, deft portraits of life, love and heartache.

0060764899|5.0|This book is a fantasy about a land called Narnia. Four English school children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie enter the world of Narnia through a magical wardrobe while playing a game of hide and go seek. The four children are in this magical land to help the golden lion, Aslan, to defeat the White Witch. The White Witch has used her magic and cursed the land of Narnia with everlasting winter without Christmas. Throughout the book, the children meet many magical characters and animals. The children are forced to fight a war against the Witch and defeat her, which changes the land back to its original beauty and removes all curses she had on Narnia. The children became the Kings and Queens of Narnia for many years in Narnia time. However when they went on a hunt for a white stag, the children stumble upon the lamppost that they had found the first time they entered Narnia. The children wander in the forest near the lamppost and they fall out of the wardrobe that they had entered many years ago. On the other hand, the children were no longer adults as they were in Narnia, it was the same time, same day, and the children were in their same clothes that they were wearing when they wandered through the wardrobe and found Narnia.    This is a high quality book in the fantasy genre. Most of the characters are fictional, yet the heroes of the story are children. There is more than one set of literary elements within this story. Each adventure in this book has its own problem, yet there is always one main problem. The language and style of this book is of English literature and some of the wording is different than the English used today. This book also has a different style. The children embark on an adventure to a magical land and find that they are the children of Adam and Eve. To them that is not important, however to the Narnians it means a great battle is to be had.  There are a few illustrations through this book in black and white, however they do not tella story within themselves. The story is told through the printed words. The illustrations are to give a glimpse of the Narnians or land in which the chapters are focusing on. The strength of this book is the high level of fantasy and adventure. The only concern for this book with lower readers is the names and the old English language used throughout the story. The reading level for this book is middle grades starting in fourth to eighth. In the classroom this book can be used as a beautiful example of fantasy. In the classroom, a way to see what the students are visualizing while reading is have the students complete a ten minute quick draw (Yopp & Yopp, 2006). The students can also predict the ending of the story, or even the ending to a chapter. The students can also journal about which character they would like to be use examples in the book to support why they choose that character. Also, the students could journal on the last quote from the professor, \\"But the professor was right it was only the beginning of the adventures of Narnia\\" in which the students could extend what they think this predicts for readers (Lewis, 1950, p.206). Lastly, the students could create a comparison chart and compare the fantasy in the story and reality (Harvey & Goudvis, 2007). The only concern for this book is the violence during the war and the fighting being discussed in the classroom.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|I loved this HBO Miniseries.  I am already a great history buff and  a lover of the US Constitution and our founding fathers wisdom.  So many people don't care about history which I find disturbing because  there is so much too learn from it.  These men and women were all  too human and desired then what most of us take for granted now.  I am buying the DVD set to share with family and friends who dont have HBO.
1400064287|5.0|Yes, this book provides practical ideas for creating \\"sticky ideas.\\"  It's worth reading for that alone.  However, there is a concept in the book that really got me thinking.  They call it the \\"curse of knowledge.\\"<br /><br />The essential idea behind the \\"curse of knowledge\\" is that we tend to forget what it's like not to know something, because we've known it for so long!  Just think about what you know about the business you're in.  How much of what you know would be foreign to people you meet.  If you're like me, that's probably a lot.  Yet, I know that I tend to communicate assuming people get what I'm saying.<br /><br />Made to Stick has challenged me to think about what it was like not to know certain things, and to communicate accordingly.<br /><br />Great read!!!
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|This is a witty and perceptive deconstruction of our current attitude to the War on Terror, utilising the much-neglected medium of ballroom dance.<br /><br />In \\"Candy Shop\\" - a thinly-veiled reference to Kandahar, perhaps? - she employs a Viennese Waltz/Nirvana mash-up to express her sorrow at the cavalier attitude to human life.<br /><br />The metaphor in the second track \\"4 Minutes\\" is even clearer: to highlight the scandal of terrorist suspects being held without trial, Madge cracks her whip while Justin Timberlake and Timbaland, dressed in orange jumpsuits, rap from inside a burning effigy of George Bush.<br /><br />Even the cover photograph warrants close attention: the legs akimbo pose expresses the paradoxical nature of the current European position - a confusing mixture of military aggression and societal vulnerability.<br /><br />This is undeniably the most satisfying and intellectually stimulating release since K-Fed's stupendous \\"Playing with Fire\\".
B000059GEH|4.0|I remember the first time I saw this movie. I loved it and I was glad to finally find another movie with Monroe that I really enjoyed and didn't think it was just ok. While the movie is great its extremely old in terms of the situations given to the characters. These woman would definitely not be likely characters in todays world without some major twiking. But even looking beside that this is probable one of my favorite performances by Marylin, if not my favorite for Betty Grable. It's definitely worth watching.
B000VWYNNW|2.0|I am stuck with a CD I don't want! I thought it would be cool to have a few new tunes added to the original 1976 release, but I did not know that the original songs would be edited. What a ghastly mistake, Jimmy! I should've read the reviews before buying so that I could've avoided wasting money on this disc. I was crushed to hear my favorite track, \\"No Quarter\\", edited. Worse, it seems that Jimmy Page wanted to showcase his guitar work over the rest of the band. Some of the others' contributions are either missing or are drowned out by an over-amplified guitar.    The production quality is better? Well, so what? I wanted the experience of the original recording, which means I must shell out more money to get the original. Was that the idea?    If you liked the original \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" from 1976, don't waste your money on this new release. You will be disappointed no matter how many people praise the sound quality.
B00104W8T6|5.0|The movie Juno was EXCELLENT! Ellen Page was terrific in it as were all the other actors! The soundtrack is just AWESOME! I knew as soon as I saw the movie I had to buy the soundtrack because being a child of the '60's myself I could definitely relate to the music! Kimya Dawson puts into words what I am thinking so well! \\"Loose Lips\\" was especially entertaining! I listened to the soundtrack the first time with my 29 yr old son and he also loved it! The movie and music really spans the generations! We need more movies like this!
006088732X|1.0|In the first chapter, two 15/16 YO girls smoke marijuana.  In the next chapter, a girl the same age goes to a bar, gets drunk, then has sex with an adult stranger in the bar's restroom.  This book is nothing but garbage bordering on narrative child pornography.  Shame on the book industry for marketing this trash to children.  Parents, just because a book is in the teen section of the store or website doesn't mean it is actually suitable or appropriate for children--even teenagers.
B00005U122|5.0|As an older Pink Floyd fan I appreciate this DVD as much if not more than the original music by Gilmour, Waters, Mason, & Barrett.  Waters masterfully blends the music in a great concert that you'll want to watch over and over again.  Doyle Bramhall and Snowy White play the guitar riffs and leads even better than the originals of yesteryear.  If you watch this DVD your ears will fixate on the auditory teasings and you'll never want to turn it off.  I play it while at work on my computer and simply minimize the video.  Superb DVD!!!!!!
1579126227|3.0|The first \\"grownup\\" novels I recall reading were those of Agatha Christie and P.G. Wodehouse, and while I periodically return to Wodehouse with great enjoyment, I haven't revisited the Christie books until now. I figured this, her first published work (written in 1916, published in 1920), would be a good starting place. As well as being her first work, it introduces my favorite of her recurring characters, the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot.<br /><br />To my surprise, the story takes place during WWI (not after, as many suppose), a detail that plays a minor role in the story. The story is told by Poirot's occasional sidekick (he only appear in eight of the Poirot novels) Captain Hastings, who has been invalided home for the duration of the war. The specifics of his injury aren't explained, but he has gone to the Essex countryside to spend some time at a friend's family mansion (the Styles of the title). Things there prove to be rather tense, as the elderly matriarch has married a much younger man, whom everyone suspects of being a golddigger. Meanwhile, Hastings' friend and his brother are in tenuous financial circumstances due to the provisions of their dead father's will. Of course, the old lady ends up dead, and there are plenty of suspects to go around.<br /><br />Fortuitously, Hastings runs into Poirot in the local village, where Poirot and some fellow Belgians are living as refugees from the war. The two had apparently met years before, and soon Hastings has enlisted him to investigate the old woman's death. Found dead in her locked room, she appears to have been poisoned, but by whom and how is a mystery. Clues abound (as do plenty of red herrings) in the somewhat complicated story, which finds Poirot already in full form. Alas, he is the only fully developed and lively character to be found, with Hastings already his usual naive sappy self, and none of the rest of cast particularly memorable. As a story, it's somewhat clunky, although all the elements that made Poirot such a popular character are there in abundance (except his mustache mania). Not a great read, but not a bad one either.h a popular character are there in abundance (except his mustache mania). Not a great read, but not a bad one either.
B0015UKX7Y|3.0|(3 & 1/2 stars) This CD has a nice retro feel.  There's a lot of the Walker Brothers in there (a stated influence), but I also heard an occasional Moody Blues sound in the songs' orchestral choruses.  I thought most of the tunes were semi-fun throwbacks to the '60s (except for such relatively unlistenable cuts as \\"I Don't Like You Anymore\\" and \\"Only The Truth\\"), but the band & this disc have two major problems.  First, the songs are relatively mundane, lacking any real degree of catchiness.  It's sort of like a bunch of 2nd-rate Yardbirds or Zombies out-takes or something.  Second, it's very hard to imagine this '60s-ish music generating any degree of interest in today's rock-buying public, at least in the USA.  There are a few other problems, such as some bad song outros, especially the bizarre, spacey-spooky coda on \\"The Chamber,\\" which undermines any impact the song may have created.  I mildly enjoyed listening to this CD as an historical exercise, but I don't expect it to have any lasting value in the 21st Century.
B0013D8LOK|4.0|Have loved Tim Burton since Pee Wee's Big Adventure! I found this movie to be a \\"little\\" on the nightmare inspiring side.

0061122416|3.0|Let me go over once more the rating system here on iread: 3 is a definit \\"liked it\\". Therefore, I hope no fans are offended by the fact that I gave this 3 stars, though I would like to mention that if half-ratings, were possible this would be a 3.5. I fought between a three or a four, but decided to go with the lower score. I don't know why. Maybe just to be mean. But there were parts of the book that did move me deeply. Key word: parts.<br /><br />I like a good fable or fairy tale as much as the next person. Actually, I like to think a like them much more than the next person. I had heard of the wonders of this book for years and years and had always meant to read it. Now that I have, I'm pleased. It is a good book that is worth reading.<br /><br />However, I think I would have preferred it had Coelho put all his lovely thoughts down in a nice little essay. As I said, I like my fables, but I like them in a fable format with plenty of symbolism and subtleties that is not explained step-by-step to me. Something that will leave the majority of the interpretation to the reader, which in my opinion makes it all the better. I like to discover things. I don't like them explained to me unless I ask. Really, had Coelho shut up about every detail about the Soul of the World and the Personal Legend, he would have left a beautiful story about a boy following a dream that probably would have had the same message. Maybe not as obvious, but I'm sure the observant reader would have picked it up.<br /><br />That all said, I must remind you that I did like this book and I will probably read it again someday. I know lots of people found the message eye-roll worthy, but I am a sap that appreciates this. In fact, I believe it is a message that rebels against all the cynicim in our world and that the reviewers here that despised the ending did not fully understand it.<br /><br />I also like Coelho's style. I'm a simple girl and I think that if the words get the job done, so be it. Who needs the flowery words? Besides, it's a simple story (minus all the blatant philosophy) suited to simple, pure writing.<br /><br />Heck, I even think there was a decent enough adventure story in there. I admit I did find myself once or twice caught up in the deserts and their beauty. I liked the ideas of wars and tribesman and Englishman. And hey, I loved the romance.<br /><br />I just don't think the sole purpose of these things should be to carry a message. Couldn't the message just be found through them?, it's a simple story (minus all the blatant philosophy) suited to simple, pure writing.

B0010X745K|2.0|I'm a big Stephen King fan and love most of his books and movie adaptations.  However, this film was a real stinker.  The biggest problem I had with this film were the characters.  Non of them came across as being very bright and just weren't very likeable.  As characters die, you find yourself quietly cheering rather than feeling any sense of sadness or disappointment.  The acting was sub par and the overall story line was really weak.  And it all dragged on for over 2 hours.  I would only recommend this film for diehard King fans who want to see everything he does.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Everyone should be made to watch this in school. John Adams introduces us to the fundamental conflict underneath the Amercian reality; are we revolutionaries, or monarchists? The course that America took during George Washington's presidency is the reason why we are where we are today. John Adams is the man portrayed as the Founder caught in between Jefferson and Hamilton, the two poles of thinking as to who America should side with and invest in. Ultimately we sided with the monarchists, and it should surprise no one that we have ended up with a unitary executive like George Bush, a monarch in all but title.     Had Jefferson not left America and taken over from Washington, we could have supported the French, because they were our true ideological allies. Plus, we owed them. But America has a knack for siding with the morally wrong side of politics, and this trait has persisted thru the centuries. Looking at our present thru the lens of the past is crucial, and this mini series spells it out. A masterpiece and a triumph. Recently I heard a political scientist say that they will never be able to think of John Adams without thinking of Paul Giamatti. It's that good.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|I'm a little surprised that two of Madonna's best albums would come after over 20 years in the business.  I loved Confessions on a Dance Floor and expected to be disappointed with its follow up.  However, I definitely am not.  The album has much of the same upbeat dance music found on Confessions but with an even more modern, urban feel to it.  I don't care for Justin Timberlake or Kanye West and would have preferred they not be a part of this project.  Despite that fact, their hip hop influence didn't kill the album by any means.  But it did reduce my rating from five stars to four.  On a negative side note, I think the album cover is horrible (as is the title).  If I was not a Madonna fan or didn't know anything about her and saw this CD in a record store, I would expect the music on it to be low grade garbage.  I would have expected a more classy visual presentation from a 50 year old pop star with 25 legendary years under her belt.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|My husband is the true fan and the one this was bought for, but I thought I would add my two cents. Really entertaining. A little more violently graphic than the TV show and a little more language as well. The language didn't bother my 8 year old but the violence did. Just something to keep in mind if you watch it with the family. All in all I thought it was very in keeping with the series and worth seeing.
1592402690|5.0|Geoff Emerick has written a fascinating book on how he and George Martin helped the Beatles achieve some of the more unusual engineering feats that fans have grown so used to hearing but which in actuality required ingenuity and play-it-on-the-fly audio engineering techniques.  Lennon's distant voice on \\"Tomorrow Never Knows,\\" for example,\\" was achieved when Emerick decided (on his own) to channel John's voice through the speaker of a Hammond organ.    But the book is far from a simple list of engineering techniques.  The author reveals the atmosphere of various recording sessions, giving valuable insights as to how the group went from rough idea to finished song.  He also provides valuable insights as to the personality of each Beatle while also filling in gaps in Beatles history that only an insider like himself would know.    This is a fantastic book and highly recommended.

0793542049|4.0|I've owned this book for over 10 years and it's just as relevant now as it was then.  I was looking to grow my playing when I was younger and this book was a step in that direction.  At the time I knew nothing about chord structures, music theory, or much else, for that matter, but Ed breaks it down for you simply and clearly.  I worked through the whole book as a kid and a lot of the knowledge in it ended up helping me quite a bit when learning jazz in university.  Now I'm learning to play cello and want to improve my improv skills.  This book has been my go to again.  I have the theory knowledge and know how to play walking bass lines, so that part wasn't needed this time 'round, but rhythm tracks and charts included have been very useful and I've spent many hours soloing over them.  Thanks for such a great book Ed!

The ones that are comparing it to all these others, who will be trivia in 10 years, fail to see the entire package - this woman has stayed on top for 25 years...her prediction to Dick Clark way back when will live on. She is a true entertainer and there is not a single track that is bad. And she knows marketing, for sure....Hail to the Queen!

0375847227|5.0|The best part of this book is that it is actually all of Pullman's Dark Materials in one book.  It is definitely cheaper than buying all the books separately.<br /><br />Adapted as a screenplay in late 2007, The Golden Compass follows Lyra through her world of Oxford and beyond as she goes on a mission to rescue her friend Roger and the other children of the country (what would be England) suddenly start disappearing by the Gobbers.  Along the way, she meets and collects a collage of supporters, from families of gypsies, an armored polar bear, and an aeronaut.  Their mission is to save the children and find out what is really happening to them.  The book, expectedly, explains more than what the movie actually shows, including reasoning for certain events and actions, as well as scenes that never made it to the movie.<br /><br />The Subtle Knife starts in England, with Will finding an entrance to another world.  In that new world, he encounters Lyra, and a knife that can cut through anything, including air space to make new openings to new worlds.<br /><br />The Amber Spyglass deals with the upcoming war between two sides over science and religion.  It also describes the conflicts that Lyra must face, including fulfilling the prophecy and saving the universe and all the parallel worlds, including Lyra's and Will's.<br /><br />Personally, I didn't like the ending of the Amber Spyglass, but the books are a must read if you have lots of time to spare.  Settle down for a long weekend.  If you wait too long between readings, you can easily forget what happened when you last read.  The suspense will keep you going until the last pages.
6305308659|4.0|You look at the premise, about two 90s teen landing in a 50s sitcom, and you go WTF?  Then you start watching it, expecting little, and find it hard to get into.  But hey, stick with it.  This turns into an excellent movie, quite original, and just a whole lot of fun.
0007107927|4.0|I bought this book for my husband and he found it very useful.  He's already implementing these ideas at work with some very positive feedback.  He gives this 4 out of 5 rather than 5 out 5 for it's slightly patronising prose.

B00164SY52|5.0|I'm not the biggest Metallica fan, admittedly, but when I saw they came out with 'Ride the Lightning' on double LP pressed at 45 rpm audiophile edition, I had to take a chance and hear what this would sound like.  Based just on \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" justifies this purchase.  It sounded better, louder, more up front than any previous format (original LP on Megaforce, CD issue also).  If you're a diehard fan of the band, still play vinyl, and can spend the money, do so -- you will hear this album in no finer way than this.
B000RJO578|4.0|I laughed a lot in this comedy Police movie. However the last 20 or so minutes had me baffled.<br /><br />It's like a seperate movie.<br /><br />Any way I still liked it.
B00005JPS8|1.0|I have to admit, I fell for all the hype that this was going to be a enjoyable film. The reason I pay close to$10.00 to watch a film on the big screen is to be entertained, to get some emotional pleasure! One of the problems with Iron Man is that it's geared towards the mind of a child/young teen without any charm. It's so incredibly predictable, a sort of comic-book-story-formula-film. A very clever way for Hollywood to make a quick buck at the expense of an interesting (on some level) story. I'm tired of the meanie terrorist villains. I'm tired of the totally clueless good guy(s). I'm tired of the evil mentor! This story has absolutely zero imagination. It's at the intelligence level of a second-rate, Saturday morning cartoon!<br /><br />It's also about the crudest form of exploitation for financial profit imaginable! The really bad guys have always got to be Arabs, or look like Arabs. They kill innocent civilians for no reason. They hide in caves, like the hated Japanese soldiers did in World War 2. But only a rich and powerful U.S. weapons inventor & dealer can come to the rescue! Wow! What a message that sends to weapon makers of the world! Who would ever of guessed that deep, down, inside, one of the Merchant's of Death literally has a heart of gold (or palladium, in this case)!<br /><br />Afghanistan is currently an extremely troubled country even though it has a very rich cultural tradition. It's a shame it was dumbed down in Iron Man to helpless civilians, brutal warlords, an impotent and clueless U.S. military and one white man who had a very unconvincing conversion experience. If Hollywood is going to bring politics and current events into a comic book story then they need act more like mature adults, instead of soulless moneygrubers trying to make a quick buck off of the horrific suffering of people in some distant land. Afghanistan is not some make believe place! It's a place where real people, including brave Americans, and many others from around the world, are risking their lives everyday!<br /><br />I hope Hollywood stops treating the moviegoers of the world like a bunch of idiots. And, while I'm at it, it would be nice if some of the many millions of dollars Hollywood is going to make from Iron Man is donated to various third-party, non-profit organizations working on reconstructing Afghanistan's civilian infrastructure! They certainly could use the money!<br /><br />For those who think selling weapons is funny see: [[ASIN:047026196X Merchant of Death: Money, Guns, Planes, and the Man Who Makes War Possible]],  [[ASIN:B000BYA5GO Lord of War (2-Disc Special Edition)]],  [[ASIN:B00009AOBP The Ugly American]] and most importantly: [[ASIN:B000S1ZTUC Committing to Afghanistan: the case for increasing U.S. reconstruction and stabilization aid.: An article from: Military Review]]<br /><br />For a MUCH more entertaining approach to Science Fiction see:[[ASIN:B000059HAE Zardoz]] and [[ASIN:B000059HAC Enemy Mine]] and [[ASIN:B000TZN7KQ Fantastic Planet]] and [[ASIN:B00003CXXP A.I. - Artificial Intelligence (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)]] and [[ASIN:630587493X Bicentennial Man]] and [[ASIN:B001S86J0I Galaxy Quest (Deluxe Edition)]]ng their lives everyday!

0743486285|4.0|The Heroin Diaries is a twisted, fun ride back in 1987 that will having you laughing and crying at the same time.  Although this book is Nikki's pity party, there are some touching moments in the book that deal with his childhood and his realtionship with his mom, grandparents and siblings.  The testimonies from his biological family are the best parts of the book because they give you a glimpse of the man, not the narcisstic rockstar.  These beautiful moments in the book stand-out and save this tale from being the typical a boring, \\"woe is me\\" read.      This book would not be complete without Denise Matthews (aka Vanity).  I am so glad she participated in this tale as she was a huge part of Nikki's path of destruction.  She is portrayed as the evil pied piper, although as the reader, I think this is a bit of revisionist history on Nikki's part.  He probably strung her along as much as she strung him along.  Matthews' wacky, God-inspired exerpts are hilarious, thought-prokoving and just plain weird and I'm so glad they were included.  Nikki & Vanity were two peas in a heroin pod.    Everytime Mick Mars and his Yoko Ono girlfriend, Emi Canyon got blasted by Nikki I was rolling!  I found myself turning page after page.      I don't know if the average Joe would find this book worth going through but as a Motley fan, I was enlightened by it and am glad to hear how it \\"really\\" went down.   I don't know if his writings were written back then but it doesn't matter.  Its an entertaining book.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Michael Moore was a fine filmmaker before he became Michael Moore the Celebrity.  A few people may have forgotten that, in which case this film serves as a reminder.<br /><br />It's about people.  He starts with profiles of some folks in the US, then goes around the world, mostly staying in the background and letting the people and the facts speak for themselves.  It's just, as the title of this review might suggest, an excellent film.  That's all.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|Sweeney Todd was by far one of my favorite films. Tim Burton has really outdone himself with this film. He has chosen a great story with a remarkable cast, that work so well together. My favorite actors Johnny Depp and Helena Boham Carter are both amazing together. Since im a person who does not like musicals, I love the fact that I can sit and enjoy this music as well as the story and the acting. I do love the horror movies ,and am a fan of every Tim Burton film made. He has done an excellent job with this one, and I love it. This is the best movie ever!

B00007LTIB|5.0|Looking 3+ decades into the past, it appeared that progressive rock was on its last legs.  Critics gleefully cited 1973's \\"Tales of Topographic Oceans\\" as bombastic nonsense brought on by the excesses of the success of progressive rock.  Progressive rock was rapidly disappearing from the mainstream.  However, progressive rock never died, it just became less visible, partially sunk by the weight of its concepts.  It was in the waning years of progressive rock's greatest success that Yes released \\"The Gates of Delirium,\\" an excellent album that backed away from the philosophical noodling of \\"Tales.\\"  This album proved that progressive rock had a lot more to say, if anyone was still listening.<br /><br />The first track is \\"The Gates of Delirium,\\" the longest song at nearly 22 minutes.  The beginning of this song is delicate, almost tentative.  I can almost imagine that the beginning of this song is a kind of apology to fans who failed to understand or enjoy the overpowering bombast of \\"Tales from Topographic Oceans.\\"  However, the beginning of this song is not an apology, but the quiet, peaceful beginning to a song of war, much like Tchaikovsky's \\"1812 Overture.\\"  Indeed, the more I listened to this song, the more I found parts that matched \\"The 1812 Overture.\\"  Referring to the booklet included with my Rhino remastered version, I learn that this song was loosely based on \\"War and Peace\\" by Leo Tolstoy.  Both \\"War and Peace\\" and the \\"1812 Overture\\" were inspired by Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812 and the events leading up to that invasion; similar source for motivation, similar, if different, outcomes.<br /><br />The \\"battle\\" portion at the middle of the song is dramatic and sophisticated.  Understanding that the song is about a war is helpful, but it takes little analysis to come to the realization that the middle portion is about conflict.  The complexity of the music is a treat for progressive rock fans, though true enjoyment could take some time since the discordant threads that intrude through the middle portion of the song are initially disturbing.  After gaining a better appreciation for the song, I finally came to enjoy the cacophony of the battle.  The contrast of the battle with the first portion of the song and the last two portions of the song, which includes \\"Soon,\\" heightens the song's drama even more.<br /><br />Musically, the song is mixed.  Steve Howe's guitar is brilliant.  Jon Anderson's vocals are generally fine, though I thought he might have been reaching to the edge of his capabilities in a couple of places.  Chris Squire's bass makes me long for the era when the bass guitar was more prominent than it typically seems to be now.  I have read criticism of Alan White's drumming, but I find the criticism to be excessive.  Alan White's drums are precise and accurate, and periodically intense to the point where the drums give this song a bit of a metal edge.  My descriptions leave keyboardist Patrick Moraz.<br /><br />Rick Wakeman was and is a phenomenal keyboardist.  However, his keyboards sometimes overpower the other instruments.  The change from Wakeman to Moraz was very noticeable.  I appreciate that Moraz's approach to Yes's music was understated compared to Wakeman's, but I was accustomed to Wakeman.  Moraz falls short for me.  However, I do like the delicacy with which Moraz plays synthesizers.  I also think that Moraz's synthesizers really helped the end of this track when Jon Anderson sings \\"Soon.\\"<br /><br />In summary, \\"The Gates of Delirium\\" is an incredible work that stands with the best music that classic progressive rock has to offer.  The music and lyrics are accessible with minimal effort.  The musicianship, especially the guitars, is fantastic.  Jon Anderson really pushed himself vocally, but the result is enjoyable.  Fans of classic progressive rock need this song in their collection.<br /><br />The second track is \\"Sound Chaser.\\"  I enjoy this exuberant song that revels in joy and contemplation.  One thing immediately stands out to me in this song, and that is Steve Howe's incredible finger work on his guitar.  Though Steve Howe's guitar dominates much of this song, interlaced with Chris Squire's bass, the support from the other instruments reminds me of a much more realized version of \\"Moonchild\\" from \\"In the Court of the Crimson King.\\"  Alan White's drumming periodically reminds me of Chicago's \\"Motorboat to Mars.\\"  I even enjoyed Moraz's keyboards on this song.  This song is essentially an instrumental with minimal vocals for spice.  The only problem I have with this song is the \\"cha-cha-cha\\" vocal, which is fortunately brief.<br /><br />The third track, which was the final song on the original vinyl album, is \\"To Be Over.\\"  After the complexity of the first track and the enthusiasm of the second track, this track provides a peaceful coda for \\"Relayer.\\"  The music is mellow and delicate.  The vocals are smooth and mellow.  Portions of the music transcend my ability to describe (which is how music should be).  This song fits so well in the era in which it was created, surrounded by The Moody Blues, Pink Floyd, King Crimson and others who tried something different and expansive, unworried about whether the music could be packaged commercially.  Those really were the days.  Listen and remember.<br /><br />This remaster also includes single versions of \\"Soon\\" and \\"Sound chaser.\\"  A studio run-through of \\"Gates\\" is the final track (Jon's vocals are unpolished and the music is good, with a couple of clunks); all nice stuff to have, but not mandatory.<br /><br />I suppose every generation thinks their music was the best.  Yet, as much as I keep looking now for what was then, when there was so much, it seems there is so little to find.  How fortunate that this music is now timeless, forever available as CD's, MP3's and more.  Here is music to lose yourself in, but only because you can find yourself in the music.<br /><br />Enjoy!me in this song, and that is Steve Howe's incredible finger work on his guitar.

Would highly recommend this movie for high school, college students and adults because the movie's \\"tour of a slave ship\\" help show the human side of the fight to end slavery.

B0012OVFV6|5.0|This is a review of the sound quality of the latest MoFi remastering of this  album, NOT a review of the merit or stature of Abraxas (we already know it is classic).    Having had several iterations of this album over the years, most recently the last Sony remaster, this MoFi blows everything else away.  Incredible clarity, great 3-dimensional imaging... it's hard to believe that after all these years, Sony hasn't been able to get so much musical information out of the mastertape for their previous releases of Abraxas and that MoFi just did.  I should note that the earlier MoFi release of this paled in comparison.  It was surpassed by the last remastering of Abraxas that Sony did, BUT it was state of the art at time of release, and that's been many, many years ago...  FIVE STARS!!!
B00000FYIL|4.0|Watching the very good film I was thinking I've got to purchase the soundtrack.  It's a large part of what makes the movie so good.
B000EHSVOG|5.0|Somehow this movie features both camp fun and a genuine story, thrills and chills.The opening sequence is incredible. And for the most part, the movie gets better as it goes along. Sure the story bogs down a little here and there, but whats amazing is that a movie that is so FX heavy has a story at all, let alone a fairly engaging one. The sub-plots are well done, effects are fantastic, AND you get to see Newman and McQueen work together.Among the best of the disaster films , Towering Inferno has something for everyone. And what a great title!
B0012K1ILW|2.0|The Quick & Dirty:  Badu's \\"New Amerykah, Pt. 1: 4th World War\\" takes hip-hop loops, slight touches of neo-soul stylings and 5 percenter rhetoric and let's it marinate for a while...but once done never garnishes the dish.    The Lowdown:  I have all the respect in the world for Ms. Badu, for through her eccentricities and hippie mentality there shines the soul of a true artist and musical visionary. Unfortunately, her instrument is her voice. Now, she can without a doubt hold her own, but she is forever at the mercy of her producers. On \\"New Amerykah...\\" this is painfully evident. Her vocal talents are mired under production that is at first jarringly different, colorful, even refreshing; however, once the novelty wears off, the listener is left with not much substance, just repetitive, monochrome stylings. Lyrically, the album is mostly a mess, with cryptic, nonsensical ramblings filling in for real substance and meaning. It's as if she wants so bad to be heard, relevant and/or revolutionary that she overcompensates with confusing and hollow sentiments. Note to Ms. Badu: true revolution is simplicity (check Marvin's What's Going On, Mercy Mercy Me, What's Happening Brother, et al).    The Bottom Line:  This project is an interesting first listen. But, once past the novelty, the reality is seen: \\"New Amerykah...\\" is a tremendous waste of potential and promise.

B000UO338W|5.0|In my opinion this is a better album than Rio Grande Blood, which for some reason most people seem to like a bit more. I think this is a little more diverse than Rio Grande while still keeping the industrial/thrash sound they are known for. The beats-per-mintute are toned down just a bit, but there are more layers to the music-weaving guitars, layered samples ans some really interesting drum programming. There is an appearance from Burton C. Bell (from Fear Factory) on a couple of the later tracks, and even a cover of the Doors song \\"Roadhouse Blues\\". Sadly this is supposed to be Ministrys' last album but I'm not sure if I believe that (or want to). Highly recommended.
1591841984|5.0|If you are a fan of Apple then you must also be a fan of Steve Jobs. If that is the case, I think you will enjoy this latest book by Leander Kahney - Inside Steve's Brain. Leander Kahney is also the author of The Cult of Mac and Cult of iPod.    In his latest book, Leander talked about what made Apple so special, with Steve Jobs at the helm. If you think that working under a fussy and demanding boss is a bad thing, think again. The bright side to this is that your work will be much more refined and of higher quality. And that's why Apple's products are so different from the rest of the competitors.    Overall, this book is an easy and interesting read and made me rethink about the quality of my work. If you are always curious about Steve Jobs and how he works, I strongly recommend this book. I have enjoyed it greatly and I am sure you will too. And one more thing, hug your fussy and perfectionist boss the next time you meet him at the office - he drives the best out of you.    --   Wei-Meng Lee,   Technologist & Founder, Developer Learning Solutions  [..]    Author of:  * Professional Windows Vista Gadgets Programming (Wrox)  * ASP.NET 2.0 - A Developer's Notebook (O'Reilly)

0143034901|4.0|I picked this novel up on a whim in a bookstore and I was thoroughly hooked after reading two pages. It's a book about someone who loves reading (a boy given the privilege of visiting the \\"Cemetery of Forgotten Books,\\" where he may rescue one volume). Certain grand-guignol plot elements in the middle might be a bit much, but when I got to the end I was very sorry the book was done and couldn't wait to recommend it to people.<br /><br />Lucia Graves' translation blew me away (and I'm very picky, being a translator myself). I read this book in Spanish first and wound up rereading it in English once I got a look at Ms. Graves' gorgeous prose. She somehow figured out what made Ruiz's writing tick, and lovingly took it apart and reassembled it in English. The \\"feel\\" of it is absolutely right.<br /><br />Is this a life-altering work? No. But it's an engaging, evocative read and a wonderful piece of storytelling. I can't wait to read Ruiz's newly released \\"El juego del &aacute;ngel,\\" which reportedly also deals with the Cemetery of Forgotten Books.
B0002WYS6S|4.0|The editorial review above pretty much sums it all up.  Very talented musicians. Well done DVD. Even if you're not sure if you like these guys, this is worth seeing. Buy it.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Let me preface this review by saying I'm traditionally more of a speakers guy myself, however a new job in a new city forced me to have to get headphones.  I do have a lot of listening time in on some of the industry's most respected phones (Etymotic ER4, Sennheiser HD600, AKG K701, and Beyerdynamic DT-770, for example), however I've just always preferred the open sound and impact that only a great speaker system can give you.<br /><br />Anyway, let's move on.  I needed a set of headphones quick and didn't have a whole lot to spend what with the move and all, so I settled on the 7506 after generally positive reviews from about everybody I asked.  I received them in and broke them in for about 48 hours before sitting down with them and starting to run music through them.  It's about three months on listening to them every single night and I think I'm ready to write a review.<br /><br />The first thing you notice is, despite how they look, these aren't flimsy headphones - they use more metal than plastic, yet despite this, they don't feel very heavy, nor do they become uncomfortable quickly.  I've got pretty big ears, and I can wear these for hours on end without a problem (which isn't the case with Sony's V600/700).<br /><br />Moving on to the important part - the sound.  The easiest way to explain these headphones is to say they don't have much character of their own.  While that may seem like a stab at them, what I'm actually saying is they're very even tonally and don't venture too far away from flat response in their usable range - and speaking of range, the low frequency response is almost mind blowing.  I have never heard headphones anywhere near this price that go this low this easily.  Even the V700 (which I used to own) couldn't go anywhere near this low at usable volume levels (the V700's are way too bloated in the low regions, which seems to hurt the extension).  Also, these headphones are extremely easy to drive, able to crank out high volume levels fromportable devices, so for you iPod folks, this is definitely worth checking out.<br /><br />Now, to nitpick a bit.  The pleather earpads, while fairly comfortable, make your ears sweaty after a while in warm environments, and I'm told they wear out fairly quickly, however Beyerdynamic makes a velour pad for their DT250 that's pretty much a direct replacement (and I'm told a bit more comfortable).  On the sound, while the frequency response is quite flat, the character of the sound is a bit plump in the lower midbass region, and a bit thin in the midrange - slightly so, but you'll hear the difference as you get into more expensive ($200+) headphones.  Also, the headband on mine keep going back to their original positions and I have to keep sliding them back to the 4th click on both sides.  Finally, I'm not sure I'm hugely fond of how the cables to the elements themselves extrude out of the frame a bit.  Once in a while when I take the headphones off, I hook my finger on there - it doesn't really bother me, but I'm worried about breaking the connection one of these days.<br /><br />That said, these are a fantastic set of headphones, and I'm convinced they're about the best you can buy for under $100 overall, depending on your tastes (Grado SR60's are a bit darker and groovier with more sting in the highs and Sennheiser HD280's are a bit smoother on top and less analytical overall, at this price point), and the nitpicks aren't enough to stop me from giving these a five-star review.<br /><br />One last thing: a lot of folks say that these are physically identical to the MDR-V6 (NOT the V600!) except for the stickers on the sides of the enclosures, and there's evidence that supports their theory, however as I've not personally heard the V6, I can't say either way.  Would be worth checking out - you might save yourself twenty bucks.<br /><br />Overall, a great sounding headphone with awesome low frequency extension and high sensitivity for a great price.  Highly recommended.
B0006L89N8|1.0|No sane person should ever consider ascribing to these sexist ideas. I've listened to the tapes, read the books, and became more concerned for couples needing REAL help as I went along. Yes, there are some differences between the sexes, but this guy doesn't come close to getting it right, and if you're a man following his advice, then you can write off having a long-term with an INTELLIGENT woman. This fake doctor creates \\"escapes\\" and excuses for sheer bad behaviour of men, claiming that it's innate to the male gender, and suggests that their women forgive them for it!   Sure, forgive him....but expect your man to GROW UP at some point!   I support equal respect for men from women, and vice versa. Gray expects us to believe that a man should be able to look at other females...and also suggests that its a woman's DUTY to at least provide manual or oral gratification whenever he needs it. Hey, if I catch you flirting with other women, or DEMANDING carnal favors from me rather than gently soliciting them, and you support your bad behaviour with this book, it's ALL over!   Mr. Gray is an over-grown child looking for a loophole for his bad manners towards the women he's offended. For those looking for a better appraisal than mine, please do an internet search for The Rebuttal From Uranus, the critics there really capture the truth. (I think I'll go to my \\"cave\\" now. As a woman, I have one too, it's not just for men!) Don't Buy This Book!
0810993139|4.0|While I have to say that I heartily enjoyed this book, my only case against it is really in its marketing.  I think the people that will get the most out of it are young men who have graduated high school and at the youngest, graduated junior high.  While the novel is geared toward the age range of 12-13 year olds, I don't feel that they will benefit from the humor until they are older, solely on the fact that they are still experiencing these things first hand.  At that age I think most of the amusing things about the book will soar right over their heads.  While older readers who have survived that point in life, and have some sort of perspective on the whole thing will get a huge kick out of the ridiculous-ness of it all.  I read it in a day (not that, that's a feat because most of it is illustrations) but I couldn't put it down.  I was having a crap-tacular day at that because my car broke down and I wandered into town while I had it fixed.  At the local bookshop I saw this collection on the display table and the title caught my eye.  While leafing through it I found myself laughing out loud, and I went right up to the counter and bought it.  It was hilarious and the artwork only furthered my laughter!  It definitely made my situation much more tolerable and I now remember that day as a good one, despite my car trouble.  I think any twenty-something will get the most out of this book and will find it really funny.  Which reminds me, I have to get a copy of the Roderick Chronicles soon!
B0015XASFS|3.0|I became a Groban fan after seeing him in a one-night-only concert version of the rock musical \\"Chess\\" on Broadway. I started buying his CDs and DVDs. Watching this DVD was fun, but, for the first time, too many of the songs sound alike.    On his last DVD, Josh included Simon & Garfunkle's \\"America\\" as an encore. He has sung famous movie songs with John Williams and the Boston Pops. His songs from the \\"Chess\\" concert are some of the most watched videos on the Internet. His recent traditional Christmas CD was one of the best selling holiday CDs of all time.    Clearly, Josh Groban has achieved great success. Isn't it now time to try other things in his concerts? He has done it on Broadway and CD. If anything, I believe Groban has taken a step backward with this concert  DVD.
B0010ZR160|4.0|Ben Affleck makes a spectacular directorial debut with his effort on GONE BABY GONE, getting wonderful performances across the board from his brother Casey to the small Boston regulars who fill in the background and amp up the authenticity on this terrific film. His co-authoring the adaptation is also a fine effort. The movie is gritty and real and well done.
B0015AARJI|4.0|The SixAxis is a great controller but its lack of rumble support left it feeling a little less functional than it should have been.  The Dual Shock 3 has fixed that problem by re-introducing rumble technology to the PS3.    The controller itself feels the same as the SixAxis but with a little more weight to it which can either be a good thing or bad thing depending on your tendency to throw a controller.  The rumble is not quite as strong as the Xbox 360 controller but it does a good job at providing feedback when appropriate in the game.  The motion controls of the SixAxis are also still intact, making this the most complete controller option for PS3 users.  If you are looking for rumble support or just need an extra controller, this is your best choice.
039472903X|5.0|Some of his designs may seem old fashioned looking (hey! these are from the 60s thru the 80s)... but the elements of design still hold. A lot of his basic advertising and customer relations advice are solid. Obviously some of it may or may not hold as strong in today's mobile media market but again the basic tenets still ring true. I really enjoy his humor and his \\"tell it like is\\" tone- I recommend this book to everyone- from fellow graphic designers to anyone looking for a smart read. Enjoy it!
B00009P1O2|5.0|Absolutely the best concert EVER!!!!!!!!! Queen just blows me away everytime I see this. A real steal for the money.

B00006JIA4|5.0|I have just recenty rediscovered Queen with the Wembly concert. So it was an absloute treat to recieve this collection to add to my ever growing Queen collection. I was absolutely blown away with the songs \\"I want it all\\", \\"The show must go on\\" and \\"Hammer to fall\\" I was also amazed at the version of \\"Somebody to love\\" that George Michaels did with Queen. ALMOST as good as Freddie. There is a few songs that were not so good on the last disk but most is an absolute treat to the ears. Not to mention the soul. Also, going through the little booklet was great too since it had a little background knowledge on each of the songs not to mention the great pictures.   If you are a Queen fan this is a must to own and cherish!!! The only BAD thing about this whole set is after you've played them all it leaves you wanting more. Freddie was a great entertainer and showman and died way too soon but at least we have collections like these to remember just how great the band was and how talented they all were.

B000UCEJEQ|5.0|I have been a die-hard Annie Lennox fan since her early days as one half of the Eurythmics. Since she went solo, I've loved all of her albums and Songs of Mass Destruction is no different.    All of the songs on this album are powerful and emotive and really force me to confront my inner feelings. The song Dark Road is one of the most brilliant songs ever written. Even the uptempo songs have more depth than usual pop ditty we hear on the waves. The dark cloud that hangs over this album is that Annie was dropped by her record label shortly after its release due to poor first week sales. What a shame that we still have to measure the \\"success\\" of this album based on its commercial appeal.    Nonetheless, I want to congratulate Annie on a powerful album that resonates with me on every level. Some reviewers have complained that the wait between her albums is too long. Can anyone on here honestly say that the wait hasn't been worth it? She \\"cooks\\" each of her albums to perfection and I'll wait for her next release (on a different label) for as long as it takes.
B000002ULO|5.0|I really enjoy all the songs on this Macca release with some of his best songs all on one release. Plus James' debut as an accomplished musician too! Great special guests - Steve Miller!
B0011FXLCC|5.0|It was obvious that when Goldfrapp announced their 4th album, it will be something very different than the previous albums as always. What I like from them is that they don't repeat the same formula of the previous one.     I find Seventh Tree relaxing (Clowns, Road to Somewhere), enjoyable (Caravan Girl), sometimes funny (Happiness, Cologne Cerrone Houdini), a few times sad (A&E), and even weird (Eat yourself). But all together, the album is a masterpiece, it shows how much they have involved by passing through differend genres.    My favorite songs in this album are \\"Caravan Girl\\" because of it's vibe. On \\"A & E\\" even after the lyrics are kind of sad, the music is peaceful and enjoyable. \\"Happiness\\" puts a smile on my face, specially on that line of \\"give us all your money\\", and \\"Cologne Cerrone Houdini\\" has that something that makes me love that song. \\"Road to somewhere\\" and \\"Clowns\\" are a couple songs that will relax you and make you enjoy a moment of peace.  \\"Little bird\\" is kind of funny, the first time I heard the song (without reading the lyrics) I thought she said \\"You lie\\", instead of \\"July\\", reminding me of a funny line in Invader Zim (Nothing in common, but just reminds me of that). Also in \\"Some people\\" that she makes reference about her mysterious age... \\"Monster Love\\"... the title sounds interesting, although I have never checked carefully the lyrics, I like the vibe as well, smooth and calm.  \\"Eat Yourself\\" is the weirdest song in the album, I don't catch all the lyrics at all, but that doesn't mean is not good. This song and Clowns are \\"Deer stop\\" style, with bizarre singing, but slow and enjoyable.    Although \\"Satin Chic\\" is still my favorite song, I must admit that this album is their best, it is one of the very few albums I listen from beginnig to end at least 2 times a day... that gives me an idea of a Listmania!

B000I2J6K0|5.0|I love to workout while I'm pregnant.  When I first bought this workout, I was only in my 3rd month.  My first impression was that it was too easy, and the format was totally different from my other non-pregnancy workouts.  However, as I moved into my 5th month of pregnancy, my usual workouts got a little more challenging than I felt was safe for me and the baby.  I pulled out Prenatal Fitness Fix and started doing it on a regular rotation with my other prenatal workout.  I've really started to tell a difference.  I've adjusted to Erin's style and now, I really enjoy it and I do the workout at least 3 times a week.  If you're a fairly fit individual I recommend this workout for your later months of pregnancy.  If you're a beginner, you can start this workout whenever and it will keep your heart pumping!

0151013047|3.0|The book, this book was as a whole very interesting and intriguing, and I read it in one day (24 hour period). The storytelling brought me into Changez's life and took me to where he was. However, I will warn this is a book where the main character has a chip on his shoulder. Changez is a 22 year old from Pakistan, who graduates from Princeton at the top of his class and gets one of the most coveted jobs in his field. But he becomes disillusioned with his \\"American Dream\\" when the twin towers fall and his fears that he does not belong in this enemy nation prevail. The more he is affected by the events of 9-11 he falls deeper and deeper into dislike for America and seemingly everything American.<br /><br />As much as I enjoyed reading this book, because the writing of it was fully captivating, I did not like to be schooled and preached at.Much of the novel is Changez retelling his time in America to his American tourist stranger-friend visiting Pakistan, he says: your country this, and you do that (referring to Americans). I think this approach is flawed. I do agree that he would have gone through horrid experiences after the attack of the twin towers, as far as people responding poorly to him, and being very angry at him even though he did nothing. I guess I was in the boat for being compassionate about that, but not for blaming the US for his being in NY and graduating from Princeton...which Changez comes to view as if he had been captured and brought here to be a traitor. .<br /><br />What I will take from it is this: I loved the writing style Hamin used it kept me interested in the whole story, and his characters were lovable and real and it was easy to become emotionally invested in their lives.<br />It was extremely difficult for middle eastern folk in the US, especially right after the 9-11 incident. America became sour and angry and channeled their aggressions where it should not have. But, I will not apologize for the brief scene of patriotism that struck after the planes crashed, the flags, the unity, the feelings of brotherhood. Changez was annoyed by this, saying that we to embrace patriotism was to go back in time to WWI, more generalizations. HA!<br /><br />All in all I would recommend this, but let people know the author is pushy. It is somewhat understandable, but I am not into being shoved either way. I won't be made to hate to hate the US and I won't be made to hate everything unknown. Just be aware of the anti-American sentiment. Some readers will not have a hard time with it at all, as it is the prevalent mentality that you hear around here (liberal northwest)from bums at coffee shops, and even many people of stature in our communities here. However, because it is not my view I felt pushed around, or maybe lumped into a generalization, which is seems hypocritical for the author to do since as far as I can tell that is what he fights against.<br /><br />The Reluctant Fundamentalist quote:<br /><br />  But as I reacclimatized and my surroundings once again became familiar, it occurred to me that the house had not changed in my absence. I had changed; I was looking about me with the sees of a foreigner, and not just any foreigner, but that particular type of entitled and unsympathetic American who so annoyed me when I encountered him in the classrooms and workplaces of your country's elite.

B00144VBBS|4.0|Let me start out by saying this is an excellent start for new Toby Keith fans.  It has all the biggest hits from each of his albums from 1993-2006 plus a new 2008 song \\"She's A Hottie.  Where this greatest hits album goes in the wrong direction as most hits albums do is omitting or leaving off a few big hits.  First omission is \\"Crash Here Tonight\\" reaching #15 on the country charts.  He also omits all three hits from \\"Big Dog Daddy:  \\"High Maintenance Woman\\" reaching number 3 on the country charts; Love Me \\"If You Can\\" reaching number 1 on the country charts; and \\"Get My Drink On\\" reaching number 11 on the country charts.  Instead we get \\"Mockingbird\\" only reaching number 27 on the country charts; \\"Getcha Some\\" only reaching number 18 on the country charts; and \\"Big Ol' Truck\\" only reaching number 15 on the country charts.  We saw it on Greatest Hits 2, which came out over a year after the Shock N Yall album.  He left off all three number one songs from the album.  Now he does it again leaving off all three hits from his Big Dog Daddy album.  All three hits have come and gone off the charts.  Two top ten hits and one Top 11 song.  Disc one is 1 hour and 6 minutes long out of 80 minutes allowed on a disc.  Disc Two is only 1 hour 1 minute long out of 80 minutes allowed.  He could have had one with all his hits untitled \\"44 Biggest Hits\\" or one entitled \\"42 Biggest Hits\\" which would have all 42 Top 40 country hits out of 44 charting hits.  The two left off would be the two songs failing to chart in the top 40.   My final gripe is that all these songs are the full length album versions and not the versions you have come to love on the radio.  Songs like \\"A Woman's Touch\\" 5:36(35 biggest hits version) and 4 minutes (radio version.) \\"Who's Your Daddy\\" 3:59 (35 biggest hits version) and 3:09 (radio version.) Finally \\"I Love This Bar\\" 5:33 (35 biggest hits version) and 3:51 (radio version.)  All 1 minute or longer than the radio versions.  All in all this is a good album,but like all greatest hits albums it could use some tweaking.  The only perfect greatest hits album I ever saw was \\"Ultimate\\" but \\"Garth Brooks.    Here is my perfect toby keith collection entitled \\"42 Biggest Hits.

0670018651|3.0|Smell is a highly individualistic sense.  Humans, unfortunately, have a very poor sense of smell, and some people perceive certain scents in an entirely different way than others do.  What smells good to one person may smell terrible to another.  The authors gave rave reviews to Bandit and Angel, two fragrances which I consider to be among the most vile ever created, and gave bad reviews to many of my favorites.  The book, however, is written in an amusing fashion and can be informative as long as you keep in mind that these are opinions.

0385720920|3.0|Maybe I just don't ger Chuck Palahniuk, but after reading two of his books (this one and \\"Lullaby\\") I find his style to be boring.  Yes, he peppers his stories with unrelentingly disturbing imagery, and he manages to pull together interesing stories that start out well... but in both of these books things tend to peter out toward the end.  When you become apathetic (not disgusted or distressed) about the lead character by the middle of the book, something is wrong.  I know he carries a ravenous fan base, but frankly I just don't get it.

B00104QSOM|5.0|This movie is pure genius. Of course the acting is without equal, but so is the matching of the soundtrack, cinematography and writing. I've heard of people complain that \\"not much happens in the movie\\" or \\"it's slow\\". The movie is not plot driven and to expect a cookie cutter, hand-held progression mixed in with plot twists, explosions and other thrilling gimmicks would be to miss the whole point of the movie.     I don't want to sound artsy-fartsy but what makes this such a phenomenal movie is all the small details in the way it's shot, the transitions between scenes, the colors (e.g. the fire scene) etc.. The whole thing feels more like an opera (a good one at that) than a movie.    All this gets my vote for FIVE++ stars.
1932907009|5.0|One of my favorite quotes from law school comes from a professor who was talking about applying the moral and ethical rules of conduct to the difficult situations in which lawyers could find themselves. He said, \\"These rules don't make life easy. They make it possible.\\"  Save the Cat! doesn't make screenwriting easy, but it makes it possible. (And easy-er.) Blake Snyder details the \\"beats\\" that are followed by (almost) every successful movie. (Watch movies while following along with his \\"beat sheet\\" and you'll see that this is so. It's uncanny!) He explains what the beats are (eg-\\"Opening Image\\", \\"Debate\\", \\"Break into [Act] Two\\") and where they go in a screenplay.    Imagine trying to write a sonnet without knowing the sonnet form - how many lines, rhyme scheme, &c. In StC, Blake Snyder reveals the form of a successful screenplay and gives many helpful examples.    I've found following his rigorous structure to be a freeing experience. I know what has to go where (and why) and often the beat sheet serves as a prompt to help me write the next scene. (Snyder realizes that sometimes the rules need to be bent or broken, but one must know the rules before one can tinker with them.)    This book describes movie genres, has some useful tips for advancing the plot and \\"amping up\\" the characters and conflict, and provides great advice on writing a marketable screenplay.  All of this would make it valuable. The detailed instruction re structure make Save the Cat! invaluable. Thanks, Blake!
B0013FFMOK|3.0|I love Will Smith and have always enjoyed his films. So, when I heard he was doing this remake of the book, \\"I Am Legend\\", Richard Matheson's masterpiece of horror, I could not wait to see the film. Having already seen the two prior adaptations, \\"The Omega Man\\", starring Charlton Heston,  and \\"The Last Man on Earth\\", starring Vincent Price, I looked forward to seeing what this remake would bring to the table.<br /><br />This is an interesting adaptation of the book in many ways, capturing the essence of despair, loneliness, and hope that runs through the book and transferring it successfully to film.  Here, Will Smith is cast as Robert Neville, a military scientist who finds that he is immune to the virus that has run amok and globally killed off most of the population or turned them into vampire-like killers who dwell in the dark, coming out only at night where they prowl the earth seeking other living creatures to nosh on.<br /><br />Robert Neville seems to be the only human being left in New York City. Coming out by day with his beloved dog, Sam, which is his only companion, Neville hunts for food and necessities, taking care to get home before night fall. He lives in solitary splendor in his town house in Washington Square Park, where he struggles to find a cure for the virus in hopes of restoring humanity to those rabid creatures that were once human and now prowl the earth at night.<br /><br />The bleak landscape of a New York City that is  ravaged by the changes is compelling, and Smith, as Neville, does exude that pathos of a man who has nearly lost all hope.

I have the Panasonic RP-HTX7 headphones and they're good, the Sennheiser 280Pro's made me see (hear) what \\"EXCELLENT\\" sounds like. The things you notice are incredible. I never knew music could sound so ALIVE!!! Old music sounds new. Get then, you won't be disappointed.
1932907009|5.0|A good friend suggested Save The Cat to assist me in my screenwriting venture. I wasn't sure what to expect but he would rant and rave about the book. When I started reading, I realized why. This is one of them books where the author (Blake Snyder) not informs us, but cares about us. Save The Cat takes on a more practical approach and is geared towards anyone (from novices to pros). I wouldn't be surprised if this becomes required reading for film schools. I know I would recommend it. If anyone is interested in screenwriting, Save The Cat is a MUST HAVE.     I give this 5 STARS!!!
B000LC55F2|5.0|I loved this movie! I thought it was incredible. But after watching it the very first time I turned to my friend, who owned it and had seen many times, and asked \\"what just happened?\\" I had to watch it a few times to competely understand the entire movie. But I love LOST for the same reasons. I loved the twist at the end! I love when movies make you believe one thing and at the end it's something you never expected even though it was right in front of you.
0575077174|5.0|After 2 brilliant novels at the beginning of his career - Revelation Space and Chasm City, Mr. Reynolds' novels became either incomplete or just showing flashes of brilliance combined with lots of forget it run of the mill action. The short stories and novellas showed an extraordinary brilliance though and I've wondered if he would ever write a novel commensurate with them      House of Suns is that novel - epic space opera on a large scale but with characters you can identify with, hard sf based on the current understanding of the limits of science and a touch of fantasy and romance to complete it.     Based on the Thousandth Night novella published in the 1M AD anthology, with the same universe and characters, though different action, the story takes place in a mostly human dominated Galaxy 6M years in the future, with everything allowed except causality busting - so no ftl - moving planets out of danger, Dyson spheres, cloning, intelligent robots, immortality, matter replicators, damming stars - anything conceivable today that stays within the limits of our physical understanding of the Universe is there.    Civilizations rise and fall, but towering over them are the Lines, groupings of originally 1000 immortal shatterlings though in time some are lost to attrition - all clones of a single person to start with - that have the most advanced ships, tech, and go on Circuits around the Galaxy, meeting once every 200k years to mix their memories. Of course travel being sub-light they spend most time in stasis or slow-time - they can and do slow time at will with \\"syncromesh\\", so of those 6 Million years each shatterling lived several tens of thousands - bookworms tunneling through the pages of history as they are called by entities that actually lived through millions of years though at a slow pace    The shatterlings are almost as benevolent gods to the \\"turnover\\" civilizations of the Galaxy and they trade and do good works like preventing stars to go supernova, moving planets out of harm's way...    The story focuses on 3 main characters - 2 shatterlings of the Gentian line Campion and Purslane - Campion is brash and just on the right side of censure for various actions or inactions - Purslane has the best ship of the Gentian line and is patient and determined, making a good match with her illicit lover Campion - the shatterlings are supposed to go alone on their circuits and not form bonds...    Also in small restropect chunks we get to see the original Gentian, Abigail, millions of years ago in The Golden Hour - that's a literal name - when humanity lived in the Solar system only and the shatterling project originated and some of how the Lines formed.    Purslane and Campion meeting illicitly on their way to the next Gentian reunion and preparing to falsify their memories before dumping them in the common mix, stop by an obscure planet to fix a stardam put in place to prevent a supernova extinction of the local civilization.    Being late to the meeting, they detour to fix Campion's ship, and in the process rescue a strange robot of the machine people - Hesperus - with missing memories. Finally on their way to the reunion, they get a very disturbing message and the adventure begins...     The ending is fulfilling, leaving space for a sequel if the author desires but completing the story very nicely.
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|Watching \\"Cloverfield' is like watching a 84 minute coming attraction and once you've finished watching you realize you've been conned,duped and just plain fooled.  Filmed by someone with the shakes on a vid cam-the film just ends with Mr Shaky being crushed under a footbridge with the skyscraper tall creature still stomping around New York City and maybe taking a time out to catch a broadway show. And apparently the creature couldn't find a baby-sitter as there are a bunch of nasty baby creatures running around.    I smell a sequel coming and hopefully this time they will hire a steadier cameraman but then it will be just another Godzilla movie and Lord knows we could always use another Godzilla movie.    The only scene in this film that had any impact was the Statue of Libertys' head careening down the avenue like a bowling ball-and I'm not sure if it was a political statement but that scene was filmed clear and with a steady hand. Hmmmmmm.
B000MNP2KI|1.0|Like watching a video game- no humor or memorable music, lots of violence and sadism. More beefcake than romance. Sylvester Stallone could have been as good a James Bond.
B000063JDE|5.0|Blue Velvet is my favorite David Lynch film, and one of my favorite films of all time. In many ways it's a disturbing film, but not so much because of the violence (compared to today's standards), but because of the characters and the darkness of the human condition that they expose. It's worth watching Dennis Hopper channel Frank Booth, the sociopathic drug dealer who pretty much owns the film. Also great are Dean Stockwell, Isabella Roselinni, Kyle McLaughlin, and Laura Dern, all great actors and actresses who make the film the classic that it is. A must for film students.
B000002ORU|5.0|if you could fit all the best of the Who into a smaller box set, this is it. They changed music as we know it and are one of the best bands of all time. Great set for someone not looking for the entire collection, but you will be surprised with all the great music here!
0385338724|2.0|I loved Kinsella's previous novels, Can You Keep A Secret, Undomestic Goddess, Shopaholic & Sister, and Shopaholic & Baby.  They kept me laughing all the way through and they showed a clueless yet funloving protaganist female character.  Remember Me comes across with a great plot, but it just isn't as good as previous Kinsella novels.  I didn't enjoy the profanity, the infidelity, or the coldness of the characters in this story.  It lacked an easy going quality that most Kinsella novels have as well as humor.  I hope Kinsella's next book will be as good as previous novels because I'd rather forget her current book.

Your comments are wonderful and as with you I read this the first time when I was 19 (1969) and again quite a few times over the years and have passed it on to many in my own travels. Your comments concerning the self self self is understandable but think that you missed the most important aspect in all of that which is that you have a hard time in life finding all those other things you mentioned if you cannot find and know yourself. To me this is the meat of Hesse's understanding (along with the idea of all searches in all religions, in which he was aghast that Budhism even became a religion)of first knowing yourself and then find how it fits into the world around you.<br /><br />My 2 cents
B000SZLSB2|5.0|While slightly more mainstream with his hit single \\"1973,\\" (the only song repeated listening jars a nerve on), All the Lost Souls is another excellent release by James Blunt. His unusual voice and original lyrics makes this a must for any CD collection.
B00005JPS7|4.0|Just as Iron Man is the king of Marvel's second-tier comic heroes, Jon Favreu's \\"Iron Man\\" rules over the second-tier Marvel film adaptations.  Though not on par with the finest Marvel adaptations, Sam Raimi's \\"Spider-Man\\" series and Bryan Singer's \\"X-Men\\" films, \\"Iron Man\\" rules over all others with an iron fist.  It all rests on the shoulders of Robert Downey Jr., who portrays titular hero Tony Stark with all the reckless ego which so many now associate with Americans.  Stark is a true American hero: he wasn't born with any superpowers, and though he was born into a substantially-wealthy family, it is he who pushes his corporation to its limits and who ultimately goes beyond those limits to become one of the shiniest superheroes.  He's further separated from his peers by the fact that he doesn't live his life in painful rememberance, and thus it's not pain that motivates him to do good.  What does motivate him, probably not even he knows.    Like its protagonist, \\"Iron Man\\" is not one of the deepest superhero films to hit the screen.  Unlike \\"Batman Begins\\" (the sequel to which, July's \\"The Dark Knight,\\" stands as \\"Iron Man\\"'s fiercest competition), \\"Iron Man\\" does not delve deep into the psychosis of its hero, opting instead to focus on his struggles as an up-and-coming superhero.  Stark's origins are explored in a gritty fashion not unlike \\"Batman Begins.\\"  The similarities between Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne further connect the two films, but Favreau's vivid, colorful style ensures that the similarities end there.  Favreau was an interesting choice to direct, given that his past filmography is highlighted by two family films, \\"Elf\\" and \\"Zathura,\\" but he doesn't disappoint.  Stark's non-iron-clad activities mimic the character's lavish lifestyle, while the action sequences may be the sturdiest in any Marvel film.    But far more sturdy is Robert Downey Jr.  Like Favreau, Downey was an unlikely choice for the film, but Downey elevates the film to a level it couldnever have reached led by another actor.  In fact, this is the best thing Downey has ever done.  His dedication to the role and love of the character shines through every one of Stark's smarmy remarks, apparent in every arrogant move he makes.  Downey turns a character who could easily lose the audience's sympathy into a guy one can't help but love.  It's hard not to get excited about Downey's cameo in \\"The Incredible Hulk,\\" Marvel's next movie, released in mid-June.     Though Downey could easily hold the film on his own, he's supported by a delightful cast.  Most delightful is Gwyneth Paltrow, who is as adorable and charming in the role of Stark's gentle secretary Pepper Potts as anyone.  One wishes a character so irresistible and clever as Potts would play a bigger role in the film, but no doubt that'll happen in the sequel.  Similarly likeable is Terrence Howard, who plays Stark's best friend, military pilot Jim Rhodes - and who, as any fan of the comic knows, will wind up as Stark's iron-clad sidekick, War Machine.    The most surprising performance comes from Jeff Bridges.  Bridges, perhaps best known as \\"The Dude\\" from the Coen brothers' \\"The Big Lebowski,\\" isn't usually the bad guy.  But that's just what he is in this film, and what a villain he is!  As Stark's partner-turned-archenemy Obadiah Stone, Bridges exhudes a ruthlessness and complete lack of morality not seen in any other cinematic supervillain.  His performance is what Kevin Spacey should have aspired to when he portrayed Lex Luthor in \\"Superman Returns.\\"  It's a welcome change from the over-the-top behavior most supervillains are so fond of.     Superhero films tend to be fond of heavy effects; after all, most of the films require them.  But the effect of the effects tends to be lessened by underdeveloped or overused computer-generated imagery (case in point: the last superhero picture, \\"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer\\").  Not in \\"Iron Man.\\"  There's the inevitable amount of C.G.I. effects, but the effects have been precisely designed.  They may even surpass the stunning effects from last summer's \\"Transformers.\\"    All this would mean little if the movie was not based upon a decent script.  This script is a fine one indeed, the product of two writing duos (Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway).  It never takes itself too seriously, but just seriously enough, choosing well-timed witticism over self-conscious grandeur (as in \\"Daredevil\\" or the last \\"X-Men\\" movie).  It also, miraculously, is able to appeal equally to those familiar and those unfamiliar with the comics.  Part of this is the sensible decision to upgrade Tony Stark from a Vietnam-era weapons designer to a military designer for the Iraq War.  But while it appeals to fans and non-fans, it's those familiar with the comic that will enjoy the film the most: it hints at a number of potential storylines for sequels, and even sets up an Avengers movie.    \\"Iron Man\\" is one of the increasingly rare films which longs for a sequel and which we wish would receive one.  Now that the film has grossed a stunning amount of money at the box office, a release date for \\"Iron Man 2\\" has been set for April 30, 2010, and a second sequel is ready as soon as that one's finished.  Bring it on.  \\"Iron Man\\" may not be an excellent film like \\"Spider-Man 2,\\" \\"Batman Begins,\\" or even the original \\"Superman,\\" but it's a darn good superhero film.  And if not as sturdy as steel, it is certainly as shiny as iron.

B00006ADFL|5.0|Peter Jackson's savagely brilliant `Heavenly Creatures' has to be his finest cinematic moment.  Sure, he astounded millions (and won Oscars) for his `Lord of the Rings' trilogy, but he has never been as honest and as human as he was with his delicate handling of this startling true life story.<br /><br />The film opens with a sequence as shocking as its conclusion; the image of two blood soaked teenage girls floating across the screen.  This opening lays a solid foundation for the masterpiece we are about to witness.  `Heavenly Creatures' tells the story of young Pauline Parker, a social outcast who lives under the strict rule of her parents Herbert and Honorah.  She has no friends and truly no life until she meets Juliet Hulme, the beautiful and interesting new girl.  The two girls bond quickly and that bond grows deeper and stronger with time.  That bond is threatened though when their parents begin to suspect that maybe the girls are too close and attempt to separate them.  What happens as a result is as horrific as it is heartbreaking.<br /><br />Peter Jackson's visual styling here is marvelous; the way he interjects colors and shapes to deepen the meaning behind many events in the film and to embellish the relationship between Pauline and Juliet.  This is especially evident when studying the fantasy world the two girls create for themselves.<br /><br />`Heavenly Creatures' truly sinks into the minds of these two girls, sheltered from the outside world and jaded by everyone around them except one another.  As their devotion towards one another grows they retreat into their fantasy world, a world where they can be together always.  They have alternate identities (Pauline is `Gina' and Juliet is `Devora') and they gallivant around clay figures and sing Mario Lanza songs and are ultimately free from the confines of their natural born existence.<br /><br />This film also marks the big screen debut of both Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet.  Both girls are flawless here, utterly flawless.  Lynskey captures the desperation and loneliness that engulfs her character, a loneliness that could lead someone to kill.  Her relationship with her parents is fleshed out beautifully, and Lynskey portrays the perfect emotions at the precise time to make her character not only believable but truly sympathetic.  Kate Winslet is a revelation as Juliet.  She embodies her character with confidence and sophistication and natural charm.  It's apparent from her first role that she would become a legend, and look now, just fourteen years later, and she has five Oscar nominations to her name.  Alongside Winslet and Lynskey there is also a stunning performance given by Sarah Peirse, who plays Honorah, Pauline's mother.  Her performance is brilliant, controlled and commanding and breathtakingly honest.<br /><br />`Heavenly Creatures' is a wonder of a film; at times soft and delicate, charming and sweet and then savage and brutal; a film that will capture your heart and soul and tears it to pieces.  As some have mentioned, there are no villains here, only victims, and I think that Jackson's handling of the sensitive material helps translate that important point.  By filming almost entirely on location (that is exact location of events) as well as having exerts from Pauline's actual diary read throughout, Peter Jackson helps create a sense of honesty, a sense of truism that permeates this impeccable film.  `Heavenly Creatures' may be hard to watch, especially as the film draws to its shocking conclusion, but there is no denying that film this powerful is nothing short of heaven-sent.ey captures the desperation and loneliness that engulfs her character, a loneliness that could lead someone to kill.

0385732554|5.0|This well-written book portrays the journey of a young boy who fights to give the society in which he grows up in a better understanding of the world they live in. The Giver is a fantasy that explores a utopian community and allows for the reader to  question their beliefs on the definition of a perfect world. The novel fits the fantasy genre because it is set in an imaginative world. The main character, Jonas, is living in a fantasy world fighting to live in the \\"real world\\". The author, Lois Lowry, has a well-developed plot with a definite rising action, climax, conflict, and resolution. Also, there are many literary elements that help keep the readers actively involved with the use of figurative language and suspense that is created throughout. The author uses euphemisms to help soften the reality and build vocabulary and comprehension skills. The book's ending, however, leaves many unanswered questions to what really happened to Jonas and the community he left behind. However, this seems to have been the author's purpose. The Giver is a great instructional tool for building reading skills in the upper middle grades to early high school. There is adult content in the novel that is definitely for a mature audience. It should not be taught as a silent reading book. There are many instructional activities to enhance learning through out the book such as; journal articles, creating a graphic novel, comparing/ contrasting activities, and many more. There are also many Internet resources for both students and teachers that provide excellent learning materials to follow the novel.
0783225849|5.0|I don't think you can call yourself a film enthusiast if you are not a fan of Hitchcock.  Part of loving film is finding solace in the technique used to create film, and truly there is no other director who possesses the technique Hitchcock possessed.  The famed director was truly a master of his craft, able to generate genuine emotion from his audience, always using every advantage at his disposal and creating authentic and moving pictures that are still unmatched even today.  While he has delivered many masterpieces, in my humble opinion `Psycho' is his finest work.<br /><br />When you watch `Psycho' there are many techniques Hitchcock utilized to the superlative degree to deliver to his audience perfection.  First, and maybe foremost, we have the brilliant score.  Music can be a key to creating the perfect mood and tone for a film.  Think back to the ominous baritone that bubbles from the depths of `Jaws' and even recently, films like `Atonement' and `There Will Be Blood' have utilized the power of music to elevate scenes and cement themselves into our memories.  `Psycho' has probably the most memorable of all film scores for I can still hear those screeching violins every time I step into the shower.  Secondly, Hitchcock shot the film in classic black and white, even though color was an option.  Now while his initial reasoning for the decision may have been to save money, the end result leads the audience down a much more fulfilling path than had he opted for a color film.  Having seen Gus Van Sant's remake (which really isn't as horrible as critics labeled it) I can honestly say that color works against this film.  The rich grays and blacks help stir the feelings of imminent danger, helping to solidify feelings of fear even when nothing frightening is taking place on the screen.  The editing is also ferociously engrossing, especially when concerning the famous shower scene.  Hitchcock knows how to keep the audience on edge throughout the entirety of the film; thus the publicity campaign `No One Will Be Seated After the Picture Begins'.<br /><br />And then you have the plot, filled to the brim with mystery and surprise.  Hitchcock takes advantage of these plot twists in order to create a film that is genuinely shocking and unexpected (the first go around) and manages to still deliver shivers upon multiple viewings.  I have not read Robert Bloch's novel which served as inspiration for the film (I don't hear many good things about it) but Hitchcock's masterpiece shines brightly from every outlet.<br /><br />The film revolves around Marion Crane, a young woman who has a lot of things going wrong for her; most notably her affair with a married man.  Desiring to find a way to make their lives easier and enable her lover Sam to divorce his wife and marry her, Marion steals a substantial amount of money from her boss's client and flees town.  In her haste she stumbles across an old run down motel and decides to stay the night.  The manager Norman seems like a nice young man.  He's thoughtful and considerate, offering her some dinner and keeping her company.  He is a tad skittish and defensive, but nothing too alarming.  Then Marion attempts to take a shower, and we all know what happens next.<br /><br />I can't for the life of my conclude that anyone reading this review doesn't already know the brilliant twist in this film, for even those who have not seen this movie are certainly aware of it, but for the sake of that one person who genuinely has no clue I will remain silent with regards to the plot from that point onward.<br /><br />Aiding Hitchcock are the phenomenal performances by the cast, especially Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh.  There is a pivotal scene when Norman Bates and Marion Crane are eating dinner together that truly reeks with talent.  These two actors embody the souls of their characters and ooze forth with such commanding presence.  I am shocked that Anthony Perkins was denied even an Oscar nomination for hisbrilliant performance, creating the perfect villain who is not only fear inspiring and genuinely chilling but also honestly sympathetic.  Janet Leigh, who did receive a much deserved Oscar nomination, is also flawlessly enticing as Marion Crane.  She commands your attention and draws you into her dilemma masterfully.  The remaining cast is superb as well; John Gavin, Vera Miles, John McIntire and Simon Oakland especially delivering strong performances that support and elevate those of the two leads.<br /><br />When all is said and done there really isn't any fault to be found with Hitchcock's masterpiece.  The final frames of Norman Bates' silent madness are forever locked into my subconscious and still haunt my dreams on occasion.  Sure, there are films that are scarier and more gruesome than this classic but rarely has a film of this genre been able to reach the levels of truly sustained dread that Hitchcock captured; a dread that never leaves, only lies dormant, waiting for the right moment to unleash itself its victims once again.brilliant performance, creating the perfect villain who is not only fear inspiring and genuinely chilling but also honestly sympathetic.

B000BSNPRG|5.0|This DVD is fabulous, thanks primarily to the voice and stage presence of  Sharon den Adel. This band from the Netherlands shows in their performance  on Java Island that they are extremely talented and take their music  very seriously. There is not a bad song on the entire DVD. The music  is strong, forceful, and melodic, even without guitar leads, and has a  tendency to grow on you very quickly. I am sure if this band could get true  mainstream exposure, they would become international icons.
1582701709|5.0|I've read a lot of negative articles and reviews about this book, many saying, \\"I tried it; it doesn't work.\\" My initial reaction to The Secret was that it was too much me, me, me and not enough we, we, we. I think some readers approached the principle wishing, hoping, and praying that all their problems were solved. Like all the other failures in their life they were in it only for themselves.<br /><br />We live an interdependent existence. Failure to recognize this or care produces failure, maybe not always monetarily, but in one respect or another. After I read again the areas I hi-lited in The Secret, I found bits and pieces that when added together reflect the real secret, that we should all love one another.<br /><br />In my novel, [[ASIN:1434368793 Standup Comedian: The Secret and Beyond]], I wrote, \\"The real secret is to always want that which is best for All That Is.\\" In other words the secret to happiness is a we attitude and not a me attitude.<br /><br />Kenneth Ray Taylor author of [[ASIN:1434363023 Beyond the Shadow of Death: Book One of the Adam Eden Series]]
0525950079|5.0|Such an excellant read. However, I do prefer historical novels and especially those of the area of the English Isles. Read \\"Pillars\\" prior to reading this and hope that Follett is either working on a new addition to these two or is considering doing so. This book is not only easy to read, but the author creates such a binding tale that you can't put it down.
B000SEGTI0|5.0|If you think you know what this book is about because you've seen the movie Blade Runner, you are mistaken. Only the character names and some of the settings / situations were lifted from this book for the movie. As in most books, there is a lot more going on here. Because the movie is so highly engrained in our (real?) memories, it is difficult to talk about one without contrasting it to the other, sadly. That said, this is a classic that any SF fan (philosophy major, medical student, or engineer) should read.    Blade Runner completely missed the invented religion / technology of Mercerism and the mood organ device. Later authors like William Gibson have PKD to thank for pioneering concepts such as these. How can a religion and technology be one?    In the book, Mercerism combined with nuclear fallout explain why animals are so expensive (and coveted) in the future. Why does an electric sheep exist (pride, vanity, religious devotion)? The mood organ usage contains references to the cold war (and presumed imminent nuclear war) - husband and wife \\"dialing up\\" the desire to win an argument at all costs.     The double yellow center line between human and androids is blurred often- taking the reader across into oncoming traffic. Did Deckard pass the VK test? Rachel and Pris are the same model android? What does it mean to have feelings? Why would an android seek revenge?    This was my first Kindle novel purchase. I no longer have a desire to dial 888 on my mood organ (desire to watch TV regardless of what is on). I'm going to dial up more PKD, Gibson, and others instead!    BTW, to get the \\"Hit me with a rock\\" reference, you have to read the book...

1881273989|4.0|I thought this book was very helpful. While some of the information seems like common sense, there are some valuable lessons to be learned. It really helps you understand other people and the way they both express and need love. It has allowed me to see certain things people do as expressions of love, rather than hum-drum everyday deeds or comments. I have a new perspective on how to express love to my friends and family in a way that they will see it as love. You may only find certain chapters or stories applicable, but either way, this book is worth skimming and it is an enjoyable easy read!

Arundhati Roy unravels the story almost painfully slowly, then hits you in the end with the sad truth of what she has been trying to say all along. The story is based in India and told from the perspectives of two-egg twins (fraternal twins), Estha and Rahel. It is almost poetic in its telling, sometimes sections even reminding me of the chorus line in a song.<br /><br />The real core of the story is about how one day changed the entire projectory of the twins' lives. It all begins on the day their cousin, Sophie Mol, comes to Ayemenem, their home town. It's the week of Christmas and Sophie Mol's step-father has just died. Her arrival, and other events that happened in Cochin while the family awaited her arrival, led the twins on an adventure with irreversible consequences. Although, throughout the book the reader knows something terrible is going to happen, nothing prepared me for the ending it had. I don't want to say much more about the plot because I'm afraid I'll spoil it. What I will say is this is a sad, sad tale about human nature, forbidden love, fear and unforeseen consequences.<br /><br />I recommend reading this book, though this is a book I feel (at least for me) needs to be read more than once in order to gain the full meaning of the words. Personally, I found the language to be confusing. And I found myself getting mixed up about some of the relationships among the characters in the beginning. Instead of trying to figure it out at the time, I decided to just go with it. In the end it all made sense, but a second read will help me clarify some of the things I may have missed.
B000WS4PCO|5.0|The Joshua Tree catapulted U2 from a popular and pretty successful rock band to megastars and cultural icons. The album retains all of U2's integrity, while creating a crisper and more commercial sound. Under Brian Eno & Daniel Lanois' guidance, the songs have an ethereal sound to them. Songs like \\"With Or Without You\\", \\"I'll Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\", \\"Running To Stand Still\\" & \\"Exit\\" have simple beats, but the production gives them a strength and density that turns them into powerful pieces. The subject matter goes into politics, life, death & God. \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\" & \\"Bullet The Blue Sky\\" have political bents. \\"Bullet\\" comments on the US involvement in Central America and has a break when Bono goes into a sermon-like rap. \\"One Tree Hill\\" is an elegy for one of the band's road staff who died in a motorcycle accident. The song is one of the prettiest the band has ever done and the symbolism about life and death as a river running into the sea is beautiful. \\"With Or Without\\" was the first single and the band's first number one hit. The opening is slow and deliberate as it moves and builds into a shimmering guitar crescendo. The song is as perfect a piece of pop music you can get. It leaves you questioning whether Bono can't live without a lover, God, the band's fans or a myriad of other possibilities? \\"Running To Stand Still\\" is another song about the struggles to overcome a heroin addiction. Unlike their other addiction song, \\"Bad\\", this is a piano-based number. \\"In God's Country\\" is an overlooked gem that could be considered the best song on the album with it's ringing guitars and  biblical lyrics. Driven by a harmonica and guitar riff, \\"Trip Through Your Wires\\" has a bluegrass sound. \\"Exit\\" and \\"Mothers Of The Disappeared\\" both explore loss. \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" was their second number one song and really sums up what U2 is all about. They are searching for answers, but no matter where they look, they still haven't found it.nd it.
B0010YSD7M|3.0|Had to buy it to see how the Ori story arc ended.  Would have been great as the series finale for Stargate SG-1, but not a stand-alone movie.  Sort of a clever business move to end the series with a cliff-hanger, and then release  the final episode on DVD - but....
B00005MCX2|5.0|Hawkwind were always a good album band, but this record leaves no doubt they were a better live unit than a studio one. Songs like \\"Argon Acumulater,\\" or \\"Time we left the world today\\" are one or two chord structures, and work better when the band can spread out and improvise on them. It is almost like Coltrane's \\"My Favorate Things\\"; the studio version is  fine, but live is where the music really snaps, crackles and pops.<br /><br />The whole band is great on Space Ritual, but I have to give Lemmy a big hats off: he really knows how to set a bass pattern, expand and improvise on it, while still giving the band a rock solid launching pad. I know guys who are great bass players who learned a lot of what they know from what Lemmy did on this album.<br /><br />Space Ritual is dark, creepy and cinamatic. It really is music you can sit down and take a trip on, with or without the drugs.<br /><br />Highly recommended

B00009Y3L4|4.0|Liza Minnelli at her peak in a performance that showcases her acting, singing while surrounded by an excellent cast. It is not your typical musical that you can sit down with family and watch, but still bound to be a classic. Good direction and strong performances that are visually enhanced by costumes, scenery and a great music score.
0439813786|5.0|I had read this book before I purchased, so I must admit that I was already sold. Amazon had a good price, and I couldn't really find it available anywhere else.   This is an amazing children's book, original, and thoroughly enjoyable for adults alike.   It's about an young orphan boy, an old man, a young girl and a incredible piece of automata; the story is a mystery, and as the story unfolds, all the missing pieces of the story are found along the way and eventually they are all restored to it's rightful place.   Like a perfectly designed machine, that had long been neglected, being discovered, by the one person, who could who could unlock the true potential in the machine and within them self.    There are several sites about the author/illustrator and book, available online one particularly intersting site is  [...]  I hope customer enjoy's the book as much as I did!
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|It is really hard for any review to do this band justice. Every song in this CD, from Dark Chest of Wonders to Live to Tell the Tale, is the result of many years of work and skill.  Each member, all famous artists in their own right, worked together to create a wonderful, heart beating opera for the dark, cold, side of the human soul.  Yet while it has great depth it also seems to have an uplifting effect on my mind and body.  The amount of energy, time, and experience that has been poured into this CD shows with every word, every sound, every emotion.  I am amazed that it took me this long to find out about this band!
B00133KHCY|5.0|This is a very entertaining and well done movie about a musical prodigy. The music was good and the performances by Robin Williams and the boy were wonderful. I would recommend this movie to my family and friends
B00004RF98|1.0|This is an excellent comedy musical with a brilliant screenplay which ages very well and I can say that most of the jokes are still funny today.  The dialogue is exceptionally witty and the choreography is first class.  Gene's moves are great but I thought that O'Connor's were even better!  The storyline is also intelligent concerning the demise of silent movies and the advent of sound told in a very amusing manner.  This is much, much better than \\"An American In Paris\\" which had a brilliant score which is obvious because you can't go wrong with anything composed by the genius Gershwin but the choreography and storyline pales in comparison with this masterpiece.<br /><br />Too bad about this dvd though which is an abomination and an insult to its content.  The soundtrack is advertised as being remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 but you certainly can't tell as the sound quality is really very poor and I found myself straining at times to hear the dialogue at some points which alternates in volume from soft to loud.  Also the picture quality has not been restored at all and imperfections abound throughout.  Thankfully with the advent of Blu-ray, here's hoping they do the right thing and take the opportunity to do a massive restoration job on both the picture (especially the picture) and the sound quality (the very least one should expect from a great musical is good sound quality!)  Although \\"Oklahoma\\" will always be my favourite musical, this and \\"Yankee Doodle Dandy\\" come in a close second and third.<br /><br />Great musical, great film but you should give this dvd a miss and wait for a much better restored version to be released.  I know I am.
B0012E2HRC|5.0|I have a list of movies which were not originally released in widescreen and Bridges of Madison County was at the top of my list (Doc Hollywood is #2).    I pre-order this the day I saw this release and it arrived yesterday. It is so nice to see my 50\\" HDTV fill with the full wide screen version. In addition, the new extras are wonderful which includes a \\"Making of...\\" with the cast (Clint et al) and crew and a wonderful commentary track.

B00026WU82|1.0|How does it feel to have some cavedwelling sourpuss whining at you like Fran Drescher in a third-rate sitcom? I don't like it, no sir. Judas here swaggers like he don't know the humble souls what picked him up and carried him on their shoulders to this stage. Mysticism out of burlap and sterno. This poet who's too hip to be called a poet, let's refer to him as a wiry amoeba, brims with chauvinism, as well as the elitist view that anyone who is not climbing the ladder of success only has themselves to blame -- couldn't be anything more going on (why is oil listed on the stock exchange again?).<br /><br />Dylweed throws out meaningless riddles like, \\"the commander-in-chief answers him while chasing a fly\\" and \\"the sun's not yellow, it's chicken,\\" and then tosses in an angry retort to people who wonder what's his deal. He's like a Forrest Gump starvation artist who convinces some Hindus to join his hunger strike and then, 60 days in, says, \\"I'm done starving, you're on your own,\\" and splits, no one the wiser to what the protest had been all about. Cue party whistles.<br /><br />Well, you sold your Packard to get this far, so now you're out here on this vacant stretch of road, sandwiched between an abandoned gin mill and a cemetery, wondering how this Edgar Allan Poe of ragtime revisionism swindled you with his self-righteous ramblings.
0143038419|4.0|I loved this book. In the beginning I found it hard to get into but once I got to India it was fablous.  My favorite character was Richard.  There were so many \\"points\\" brought out in this book.  The book is about a woman who is trying to find herself after a failed marriage and relationship and the strength and courage she had to pick herself up and go on this self perserving journey.  The author did a great job in describing all of the characters and gave you a sense of who they truly were.  The ending was a little disappointing but since it is based on a true story you can't change the facts.   Would definitely recommend the book
B00003CXC7|3.0|This movie is a great one to encapsulate what makes Hitchcock films great.  His brand of storytelling is unique and for me very enjoyable.  He always shows us the story from the subjective viewpoint of the actor and in this case, Jimmy Stewart, as the temporarily invalid photographer who out of boredom decides to take an interest in his neighbour's activities.  In effect, he is watching many television screens aka windows outside his apartment that happen to be screening real-life soap operas.<br /><br />I disagree that what he does amounts to voyeurism because he doesn't really watch continuously just to get gratuitous pleasure out of it but he really appears to be concerned about his neighbour's well-being.  He tries to prevent the lonely one from committing suicide in addition to the main part of the story about his concern for the invalid woman who was killed by her husband.  I thought the beautiful irony was that while everyone was critical of Stewart's character spying or peeping at his neighbours and yet his concern for them and his willingness to even put his life on the line to help them contrasts with that of the other neighbours who just didn't give a damn and who are supposed to be doing the right thing.  The scene with the dead dog perfectly illustrates this as at one apartment, the party simply resumes as if nothing happened after the distraught owner's emotional outburst.  I just loved the dramatic irony of how Stewart's character was really the good neighbour despite his peeping while the others were really bad neighbours minding their own business just like in the parable of the Good Samaritan.<br /><br />The screenplay was very well written and the witty and comical dialogue especially between Stewart's character and the masseuse was very amusing indeed.  The acting wasn't brilliant but was good enough and I enjoyed the theme about the differences between man and woman and how their motivations are driven by different things and yet both are really trying to arrive at the same thing: happiness in a life together.  The final scene with Grace Kelly and the magazine was especially telling and amusing for me.<br /><br />The special features are quite good and I especially like the documentary \\"Rear Window Ethics: Remembering and Restoring a Hitchcock Classic.\\"  The only problem is with the dvd which sound quality wise isn't great and the picture quality despite being restored is quite poor with many imperfections on too many frames.  This suggests to me that the original master must be very poorly preserved if this is the best that they could do.  Here's hoping that with the advent of Blu-ray they will take the opportunity to have another try at improving both the picture and sound quality.  For the latter a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround restored sound option would be much appreciated.<br /><br />Not one of Hitchcock's absolute best but still a very good film; recommended but you may want to wait for a better restored version to be made available and to give this dvd version a miss.rrive at the same thing: happiness in a life together.

0312263120|1.0|I'm honestly surprised by the number of people who are reviewing this book in a wildly positive fashion.  Frankly, if I were Dan Brown, I'd be mortified that this book is still out there for public perusal.  The characters are presented as experts in a highly mathematical field, but when presented with a stupidly obvious puzzle they are left blinking stupidly at each other by simple mathematical concepts like Prime numbers.     There are many twists and turns, as others have said, but the premise is flimsy and the results are awkward.  All in all, this was NOT a good book.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I haven't bought a Madonna cd in some time? So, when I heard samples of Hard Candy I was pleasantly surprise. I quickly ordered the cd off amazon. This is a really good danceable effort from Madge. Love \\"She's Not Me\\" bells & All those cool sound effects.I gave it 4 stars cause Madonna is a musical icon and been in the game since the 80's. She don't seem to be slowing down any time soon. Also, I really enjoy Hard Candy it's a FUN dancable happy cd.
0792163710|3.0|This along with \\"High Noon\\" and \\"Unforgiven\\" rank among my favourite westerns of all time.  The screenplay is good but the setting is even better making this an excellent film.  The background setting with expansive views of the mountains and the beautiful prairies is a good reason enough to watch this film.  Director George Stevens seems to understand the power of colour in the film medium and in what must be one of the first colour westerns, took the opportunity to show just how breathtakingly beautiful the American prairies are.<br /><br />I love films with good premises and that teach good life lessons and this is no exception.  Shane is a gunfighter who wants to give up the trade but is finally forced to help his friends which is when he realises that you can't be what you are not but that you should be happy to be what you are.<br /><br />The problem lies with this DVD version that hasn't been restored.  The sound quality that comes in Dolby Digital 2.0 hasn't been well mastered and the picture quality isn't perfect.  Here's hoping with the advent of Blu-ray that they take the opportunity to do a better picture and sound restoration with at least Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound options.<br /><br />Great film but you may want to wait for a better restored version to surface.
044024238X|4.0|Sophie Kinsella's [[ASIN:044024238X The Undomestic Goddess]] is a quick read for commuting and equally as amusing as her other books. I enjoyed Samantha Sweeting's character much more than I did Lexi Smart. I also didn't see as much of Becky Bloomwood in this character as I did in Lexi Smart. Kinsella has a fine talent for getting to the heart of high-powered career women who forget about the finer things in life while they are competing (and winning) in a male dominated profession.<br /><br />****Spoiler Alert***<br /><br />Samantha Sweeting is a powerful attorney in London, who much like her mother strives to be the best at her job. To accomplish her goal of becoming a partner at Carter Spink, Samantha works more hours than the other attorneys and barely has a social life. When she finally manages to get time off to have dinner with her mom and brother, she ends up having dinner with two cell phones, an assistant, and singing group of waiters. Suffice to say, her personal life can't get much worse. That's what you would think, but then the senior partner from the firm, the one she does not have a cordial relationship with, moves into her building, two floors up.<br /><br />Early on, something goes terribly wrong at the firm and she panics. Heads out of town to the countryside where she is mistakenly hired as a housekeeper. At first she takes the job because she is still in a state of shock, but as she learns of the fallout from her \\"mistake,\\" she decides that being a housekeeper could be a fine change of pace. After many dirty domestic mishaps, Samantha realizes she needs some cooking and cleaning lessons. Nathaniel, the gardener, offers his mother's services after laughing at her expense when she fails to start the washing machine and can barely make toast and coffee. Iris, his mother, sets about helping Samantha become domestic. She teaches her how to make food, bread, pastry, and other items, but most importantly, Iris helps her slowdown and relax...take in the little things about life and cooking. The scenes with Iris and Nathaniel on the weekends are fantastic.<br /><br />***End Spoiler Alert***<br /><br />I won't go into all the details of the book, but there is a great scene in the garden between Samantha and Nathaniel that just made me swoon. Yes, I said swoon. I wish that romance of that caliber were real. Don't get me wrong, love is still here in my life, it's just different. The puppy love of this scene made me reminisce.

B00004SCX6|5.0|This is the best Britney has ever done. But her 3rd album would be the last time she worked with Max Martin who is the producer in charge of making her a HUGE SUPER STAR!!! I guess you turn your back on the one that made you famous so you can be considered a mature artist and work with awful producers so you can release uninspired songs. If thats the case everything after your 3rd album is a mess. But i shouldnt be so harsh. This truly is Britneys best album. Its one Max Martin original after the next. Total pleasure to the ears.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|This is an amazing selection of \\"oldies\\" sung in the inimitable style of Michael Buble.  He revives an old Frank Sinatra song (\\"The Best is Yet To Come\\") making it his own.  His rendition of \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\" is irrepressible and wonderful.  His voice is so smooth it could be termed \\"vocal silk.\\"  This young Canadian singer is talent at it's very best and worth many hours of relaxing, beautiful music.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|I had first picked up the regular soundtrack not realizing that my favorite songs from the movie were not on there.  I'd have to say I'm glad I bought this.  This album has every song from the film on it and each song is better than the last.  I love the beatles and I love their songs but I have to say Jim Sturgess sure did give the Beatles a run for their money.  I think it's definitely better than the original and that's saying a lot coming from an avid beatles fan.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who loves the beatles or saw this film and loved it as well.
0143113100|5.0|I can't praise this book enough!  I highly recommend it.  I'm just sorry all of this research got started so late.
B000H0MKGK|4.0|If I had to give this review another title, it would be \\"above-average pop singer-songwriter album effort\\". But you see, I didn't, because something about that title doesn't flow quite correctly. I'm not talking about how accurately it describes the album, I'm talking about how accurately the statement conveys the underlying idea.    With \\"Continuum\\", there seems to be a similar problem.   It's quite obvious Mayer has both an excellent vocal range and a propensity for guitar. Pretty much any song on this, his third album, will pay tribute to his somewhat limited, if solid vocal range; \\"Vultures\\" even shows off a pretty good falsetto. His cover of \\"Bold As Love\\" certainly demonstrates his guitar ability beyond any reasonable doubt.    He also has an ear for catchy rhythms and choruses. \\"Waiting on the World to Change\\" and \\"I Don't Trust Myself With Loving You\\", the album's opening two tracks, set the album off with some serious momentum that he never takes advantage of. Meaningful lyrics are also easy to find. \\"Waiting\\"'s lyrics border on anthemic about his generation's inaction, \\"Gravity\\" seems to deal with a fear of a young death. \\"Dreaming With a Broken Heart\\" and \\"I'm Gonna Find Another You\\" do a good, if somewhat overdramatic, job of summing the feelings of, well, a broken-hearted lover.    However, he never quite manages to put all these elements together at any one moment. A graceful piano line drops in after an especially awkward chorus on \\"Stop This Train\\", for example. It's apparent that Mayer has huge potential, but he too often focuses on the \\"pop\\" aspects of his songs at the expense of replayability. He goes for the anthemic, catchy choruses and the catchy, clever guitar line at any opportunity. This is not necessarily a bad thing, of course, but it makes for monotonous listening, and most songs are fairly closely held within the standard singer-songwriter range: mid-tempo ballads/narratives with piano, a soft acoustic/electric guitar, and some drums mixed in there as well, with a bass line being occasionally noticeable.    John Mayer takes some risks on this album, no doubt: trying to speak for a whole generation is pretty ballsy, and the frankness with which he sings about his feelings on some songs deserves admiration. He goes out on a limb by covering a frickin' Jimi Hendrix song, but he really doesn't add much to the song or do anything special with the inevitable guitar solo. As if to add to underline how plain-Jane he makes even Hendrix sound, both of the John Mayer fans I talked to recently about the album had no idea that \\"Bold As Love\\" was even a cover. Ugh.    Next album, I'd like to see Mayer think outside the confines of the pop singer-songwriter genre a little more. Because at age 30, he can't continue to sing about being young and about past girlfriends much longer. If I were to have a conclusion to this review it would be thus: \\"Watch this guy, because if he thinks outside the box a little more on his next album, the results could be amazing.\\"     And that sounds a little better, right?    Score: 7.25/10

B000JBWWQ0|5.0|Love this DVD, had to have it.  Packaged great, arrived promptly.  Rather buy from Amazon then Ebay any day :)
B00006CXSS|5.0|I bought this for my dad for his birthday.  I've watched it twice now, and you can't get much better than this.  Great actors, great cast, good storyline that is cohesive and flowing, and lots of action.  I find that movies like Saving Private Ryan were slow and dragging, but this whole series went by without any of that for me.  Highly recommended.
B00005JPS7|5.0|Okay, you've heard tons of reviews about how awesome the movie is.  Its like a Disneyland ride, you see it the first time and its exciting- but you want to go back to see it again, because you know you missed some stuff.  My husband and I have already been back to see the movie a second time- and yes, we will be going to see it again the theaters.  But if you are into the comics, then you wanna know how close this is to the comic book. And let me tell you, being that this is a Marvel produced movie (instead of studio produced) they took care of their baby.  Some time ago they updated the Iron Man comic from the 60's version, of Iron Man being in Vietnam, to the Middle East.  The movie further adapts it to fit the current goings on in the world.  This detail doesn't take away from the story at all.  In fact, the movie is so close to the comic book, that its obvious the care Marvel took in keeping true to Iron Man and Tony Stark.  The only problem we found was in the Jarvis representation, but it didn't take away from the story either.  There was still the playful interaction some readers come to love between Tony and Jarvis.  The 10 rings is addressed, but not fully fleshed out.  But that's what Iron Man 2 is for; seeing as this was Iron Man, and Tony Stark's introduction to the movie fan.  Favreau did an excellent job weaving this story, and making it understandable, even if you aren't into the comics- without making the comic book read feel as if the story is being dumbed down.  Its not, not at all!  He is a brilliant director, and did a fantastic job.  Robert Downey Jr is excellent as Iron Man/Tony Stark- he really IS Tony Stark and its so excellent, he's funny, and charming.. which makes it obvious exactly why Tony Stark is the ladies man he is; he was born to play this role, and Terrence Howard will be FANTASTIC as War Machine in the next film!  I hope to see Happy and Pepper together in the next film, and I hope that Tony's alcoholism plays a bigger part in the next film, as its been something he struggled with during the comics.  But this is all stuff you wouldn't expect to be overwhelmed with in the first movie, but want to see in the second film.  There is not a single boring moment.  The movie is fast paced, and takes you on an excellent ride.  The after credit scene had me howling, and will probably have every Marvel fan howling as well- so make sure you stick around for it.next film, as its been something he struggled with during the comics.

B0012E6R3W|4.0|Testament have been thru many changes over the years, both with revolving members and subtle changes in style. This CD marks the return of the great Bay Area thrash band going back to their roots, with a little bit of 'The Gathering' thrown in for good measure. It is nice to see a band still doing the time tested metal style of days past...and have it sound just as powerful and inspired as ever. Yes, I have heard the complaints that this is just a recycled sound, nothing new here. But fans of metal should be able to see the redeeming qualities of this CD...it's like an old friend you haven't seen for years, and he's doing better than ever. Lame analogy, I know. But you get the point. It is also nice to see Alex  Skolnick back with the lead chores. I think Chuck Billy sounds great, and like the rest of the players, he sounds happy to be back into the game. Don't count these guys out!!! They still got it!!!
0739341340|5.0|Made to Stick is a book I've listened to on CD many, many times. The Heath Brothers make an excellent case for the importance of making your brand 'sticky',thus the duct tape on the cover of the book. Their research and practical application make this essential reading to increase your marketing and public relations skills. This is bound to be required reading for MBA programs because of it's instant application to any business setting. Sticky brands lead to life long customers and that's what you'll learn after mastering the strategies of this book.
B000FA57N0|4.0|I loved the storyline of this movie.  And the picture quality and audio was GREAT.  But this was some of the worst acting I've seen... from pretty much everyone in the film.  It was distracting to me, and is why I gave it the \\"4\\".  I really can't fault anything else.
1400064287|4.0|I found this book exceedingly interesting.  To begin with I was immediately surprised at how quickly it read.  The writing style was quite conversational and actually held my attention throughout.  In this manner, one could definitely say that writers Chip and Dan successfully practice precisely what they preach.  By employing the very techniques they are attempting to explain, the book itself becomes a very concrete example of what it means to relay sticky ideas.  What I found to be particularly helpful about making the whole 6 aspect concept of sticky ideas (Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional, Stories) actually stick was the unique way the authors outlined and laid out the entire text.  An excellent introduction provides an overview of exactly what is going to be detailed.  This is followed by 6 chapters providing a mix of colorful examples and various studies supporting and shedding further light on each respective aspect of \\"stickiness.\\"  The book provided just the right amount of anecdotes and outside studies to break up the monotony but not so much so that the flow is lost and the reader is confused.  Overall I found the book quite informative as well as entertaining.
B0012E6R3W|5.0|I had the pleasure of seeing Testament perform many songs off this CD about a month before it was released, and I was completely blown away!<br /><br />Chuck Billy is a formidable force of nature, Paul Bostaph (who many already know from Slayer, Forbidden, and Exodus) is in top form on drums, and it's great to have Alex Skolnick and Greg Christian back on lead guitar and bass, respectively, as well as to hear the blistering rhythm riffs from Eric Peterson. Testament has come alive again, stronger than ever.<br /><br />Personally, I absolutely love \\"The Evil Has Landed\\" (about the 9/11 attacks), \\"Henchmen Ride,\\" (Hey, I'm a biker!), and the title track, but the entire CD is SOLID thrash metal, and as others have said, it is (or certainly should be) in contention as one of the best thrash metal CDs of 2008. I highly recommend it to any Testament fan, fans of Bay Area thrash metal, and thrash metal fans in general. \\"The Formation of Damnation\\" contributes significantly to the resurgence of the thrash metal sound, an honor shared by Slayer's \\"Christ Illusion,\\" Death Angel's \\"Killing Season\\" and previously \\"The Art of Dying,\\" Exodus' \\"Shovel Headed Kill Machine\\" and \\"Tempo of the Damned\\" before that, as well as several other bands from the US and abroad...Kreator being a particularly notable European thrash band. Testament holds their own with all the thrash masters.<br /><br />\\"The Formation of Damnation\\" is further proof that thrash metal is back with a vengeance! I'd say to not only buy this CD, but to see Testament live if at all possible, as they're touring extensively this year (hopefully longer), and are impressively brutal live.
B0013D8LOK|4.0|The movie is strange. The movie is grotesque. The movie is dark. But it is fun. The movie is a musical.<br />Especially when you have Depp doing what he does best... giving flesh to the most strangest characters. If Edward scissorhand was cute barber Sweeney is a demonic incarnation. The songs are sung by the actors themselves and they are an essential part of the movie. And of course there is Tim Burton from whom you can expect novelty in grotesqueness also.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|Upfront, I can see why this movie may not be for everyone.  Going into this movie, I expected classic Will Ferrell humor, but there was actually very little of that.  It was clearly his most serious role, and shows how versatile of an actor Will Ferrell can be.  I've watched this movie several times, and the storyline still hasn't worn off for me.  The movie is very moving in terms of its plot.  There are parts of sad moments, funny moments, and confusing moments, but they all come together at the end.  I actually found watching it a second time more enjoyable than the first.  I strongly recommend this movie, and hope you appreciate this for the movie it is and not the movie you may have originally perceived it to be.  Dustin Hoffman makes a great performance as well.  I believe this is Maggie Gyllenhaal's first major role (if it isn't, I don't know her other movies), but she did great as well.  Her character definitely grows on you.  Queen Latifah was completely forgettable.

B0007TKNII|2.0|I loved the play and saw it several times.  I was happy to hear that it was being filmed and hoped that it would prove to be a comeback for the Hollywood musical, but so many bad decisions were made it hard to know how to begin.  Let's start with the casting.  The guy who played the phantom was terrible.  He couldn't sing!  Maybe if you've never seen or heard Michael Crawford you might think him adequate, but his voice just couldn't do justice to the music. End of story.  The play and original story had a lot of supernatural elements such as Christine walking through the mirror and the magical lasso that hung in the middle of the air.  Part of the fun was wondering how the phantom did these things.  In the movie all this was explained away.  Christine finds the mirror to be a sliding glass door of all things.  The phantom was way too good looking. He is supposed to be scary and hideous in appearance. He is just a handsome guy with a mask.  When you do finally see him it is underwhelming.  He just isn't scary enough.  By taking away the horror and supernatural elements we are just left with a love triangle. Combine that with some of the cepiatone filming and it takes on the feel of a cheap harlequin romance novel.  These changes, though small, have a great significance.  All the fun and profundity are absent.  There are many good performances and the score is well done, beautiful sets and costumes...When I think of how good it should have been.  I have to scratch my head.  What fools!  Don't mess with perfection. And get a phantom who is scary and can sing!
B000YMBBH0|5.0|I'm happy with these movies, and have watched them a few times. The action sequences are fun, the storyline is consuming, and Matt Damon is actually a good actor (unlike Ben Affleck...). The picture quality is very good, and audio is powerful if you have a good 5.1 setup, and the movie never feels like it's dragging on. Well worth watching, regardless of format.   Unlike a lot of other movies with sequels, all of these are good.  Series like Spiderman, Pirates of the Caribbean, etc... have progressively bad sequels, while this stayed on course.  Maybe it's because the same plot continued through all three, I'm not sure.  But all three of these movies are definitely worth watching.
0800141660|5.0|This is a particularly good paced film with very good acting.  I enjoy the time period but at times these Jane Austen films are a bit slow.  Really enjoyed it.
B00005QAPH|5.0|They say that this is Federico Fellini's best work alongside LA DOLCE VITA. This is true. This is one of the most honest, personal works from any film director that you'll find. It is an intimate and captivating experience filled with some of the most beautiful moments that I have ever seen on film. To view this film is an experience unlike any other, and a film that I will never forget. Everything about it is perfect.<br /><br />SEE IT! By the way, the score by Nina Rota is wonderful.

B00008BXJF|5.0|I was a fan of crimson to start off with, and I was curious as to what direction the group could have possibly gone off in after three of a perfect pair, which I find to be an excellent album.  Coming to Power to Believe we get something that is both beautiful, and about as inaccessible as you can get.  Complex, crazy, amazing, and so completely worth it!  The songs vary from spoken word through what I assume was some sort of vocoder, to tone exploration, to hard complex rocking.  Appropriately enough, the gas masks on the cover feel like a good description of the feel of the album.  My favorite song off the album has to be \\"Eyes Wide Open.\\"  Strange, and yet beautiful, it makes for quite the listen.  If you're new to King Crimson, this will be like jumping into the deep end with no prior swimming experience, I'd recommend starting with something like Red, or Starless and Bible Black to ease you into the proper mindset.  For everyone else, sit back, relax, and let the sound wash over you!
B0013BNY2Q|2.0|I wish I could like this album more, but after four years I really hoped for something better, and at the very least something original and fresh. This is latest in a line of weak albums since UP, which was vastly under-rated. But I'll keep waiting for their next solid album.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|Portishead have evolved from simple trip hop into something that sounds like a soundtrack to a David Lynch movie that hasn't been made yet. I've listened to it 3 times now and can't understand what some of these reviewers are thinking, I might just be in the right mood for something like this. It reminds me of a My Bloody Valentine album and should be listened to from start to finish (no skipping tracks).

0393061310|2.0|The problem with attributing human social development to externalities is that it glosses over the essential differences between all societies- that is how labor is socially organized and who decides how to allocate and use the social surplus.  While geography tempers social development, it is the method of social production that is the overwhelming determinant of social success.  Slave societies out produce hunter-gatherers.  Feudal out-produces slave, and wage labor out produces slavery and feudal systems.      What is more more instructive is how current social relations restrict and hamper social development by wasting social production on useless activities like military ventures and individualized social decision-making.  e.g. Individuals riding in cars instead of individuals sharing mass transportation, a more socially efficient transportation system.
B000MFUCB0|5.0|Pink Floyd's most complete, and best, concept album. What the hell, their best album ever. The concept? It's simple. Everyone is either a sheep, a dog, or a pig. For those who honestly need to be told who's who, the dogs are the ruthless, greedy cutthroats, the sheep are the oppressed masses, and the pigs are the ruling class. \\"Dogs\\" is my favorite. For one, the acoustic guitar riff is the catchiest Floyd ever came up with. Gilmour's guitar solos are fantastic, too - I think he's a great guitarist, and this is his best album with the band. But the best part is during the second vocal part, where Gilmour sings \\"Dragged down... by the stone...\\" After he says this, Rick Wright plays a superlative sci-fi keyboard solo with some simulated dog-barking on it. This part lasts for... four, five minutes, somewhere around there. And while he's doing his solo, and his barking-dog routine, guess what? The word \\"stone\\" is still echoing! Wright and Gilmour really rule on that one. But then Roger Waters, never one to be outdone, spends the last minute indicting the dogs, and he sounds ANGRY! \\"Who was found DEAD... by the phone... who was dragged down by the STONE....\\" (*Darow, darow, darow, darow*)... \\"Draaaaagged dooooown by the stone.\\" This goes down in history as my favorite extended songs by any rock band ever. No question. Okay, maybe Hendrix's \\"Machine Gun\\" has it beat, but I digress. Anyway, next you have the ominous \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\". Holy burrito, that is a cool song. A relaxed rocker that would probably be just a really good blues song if it weren't for... Rick Wright! And Dave Gilmour! And Roger Waters! And Nick Mason, whose cowbell part rocks! The lyrics here are some of my favorites, and Dave does some crazy stuff with his guitar. Especially the \\"pig-squeal\\" talk-box. And Wright's organ, or whatever, is amazingly creepy. Then there's \\"Sheep\\", which is amazing as well. It's probably the hardest they've ever rocked, with Gilmour churning out machine-gun guitar riffs and imitating, with the assistance of Rick Wright, a bomb going off. After the machine-gun guitar part ends, the song totally mellows out and slips into a parody of the 23rd Psalm (which, of course, got the band into some hot water) that features faux-bleating sheep noises. Then, when all that ends, Gilmour lets it rip. This song, and album as a whole, rocks hard. Not as in \\"rocks hard for Pink Floyd\\", as in \\"rocks hard for anyone\\". Okay, there are two moments that don't rock: both parts of the pastoral love song \\"Pigs on the Wing\\", which bookends the album and, if both parts are tallied up, isn't even three minutes long. A self-conscience tribute to the last album, perhaps?  Don't start here - it's too monolithic and pessimistic for new fans. But certainly explore it.r riffs and imitating, with the assistance of Rick Wright, a bomb going off.

076781214X|5.0|I love this movie...I love it because it lets me go back to 'visit' my Grandmother, who I miss every day of my life. But when I am watching this movie, I am somehow with her again, even if only for a few moments. It also lets me be a 'kid' again...remembering a time long gone by, but never quite forgotten. For me, this is a movie sprinkled with tears but rich with wonderful memories of yesterday. Let's face it, we all would love to go back to a previous time and place, even if just for a moment. This movie is the next best thing.
0307120007|5.0|I have vague memories of owning this book as a young child, so when we received it as a baby gift, it was so fun to see it still in action. Our baby LOVES this book, and wants to look at it--and touch it really--every day. It captures and engages a baby's way of exploring his or her small world through touch, smell and sight. It does get worn out after a year or so, so I recommend buying two!
B000006045|5.0|I have to admit I really hated most of the other songs, outside of Tear Drop and Angel, when I first listened in the car on a long road trip, but on the way back to my city, they got in.  This is one of my favorite CD's ever.  I have them on rotation on my iPod, on burned CD's in my car, on my work computer, my brother's xBox.  You do have to be in a certain mood to thoroughly enjoy Mezzanine, but if you are you're gonna love it, not to mention is perfect for a late night with you special person, oh my goodness \\"Angel.\\"  This album is just about perfect.
1416546995|5.0|This book just about broke my heart. I could identify so well with Peter that it was scary. Jodi Picoult can take any character, no matter how flawed , and peel away layer after layer to show us the truth of that character. This book, about a school shooting, could have been so simplistic in describing the tragedy and how it affected the victims and their families. Instead, in her familiar style of interweaving the voices of different characters, and going back and forth in time, she shows us the REAL tragedy - the tragedy of how badly people often treat other people, and the sometimes inevitable consequences. Not that I'm condoning a bullied student going in and shooting up those who tormented him, but I do applaud Ms. Picoult for daring to show the perpetrator of the massacre in an often sympathetic light. She portrays a common, ongoing problem in our schools, and she does so in a way that commands our attention and leaves us wondering - who really IS the bad guy here? Definitely one of her best.

It has actually made me laugh out loud, scaring my co-workers. Jamie, the leading man, is larger then life, and I go around with a horrible scottish accent after reading this for a while.<br /><br />The story goes that that in the 1940s, our lady Claire fell into a fairy hill in Scotland and was whooshed back in time to the 1740s, meets and falls in love with a big burley Scot, and they get into trouble everywhere they go.

1594489505|1.0|The book opens squarely focused on the story of a woman named Mariam as she grows up.  Her story is almost unremittingly tragic, and is not recommended for anyone with any trouble with depression.  I had to read the book for my book club so I persisted, hoping that there would be some hope, some redeeming feature.  (At some point, when nearly every single experience in a character's life is horrifyingly disastrous, as a reader I feel that I am simply being manipulated for manipulation's sake.)  Well,  the only thing that the author could have done to make Mariam's story any sadder would have been to have her childhood tutor molest her-- that man was one of the very very few seemingly decent males in the book.  What it looks like to me is that the author's original draft focused only on Mariam, but that he was told the book would be unmarketably hopeless in its demeanor if left as is.  He therefore cobbled together a (very uneasy, confusing)  transition to focus at the end of the book on the story of a younger woman who does have some measure of happiness in her life, eclipsing Mariam's predictably horrendous end.  An awkwardly written book, not worth reading.
B0010X8NF0|4.0|There's no doubt about. Right from the beginning, it's obvious that this is a Wes Anderson film. Some people feel like he needs to move on to something more substantial, more serious, or whatever. They feel like his films are too cute, too stylized, and the characters too brooding and self-centered. To this, Rolling Stone's Peter Travers asked why we would ever want him to do something he's not good at. Martin Scorcese does violence because he's so good at it. Other directors have their specialty.     This is a good film. I found it to be moving and surprisingly serious, given the relative lightheartedness of some of his earlier stuff. The cinematography is beautiful, the setting is wonderful. As always, the music rocks. Great cast, great dialogue. There's one scene that I felt was too convenient, too forced, and too plot-handy (the brothers save some boys in a river). But that's really the only weakness I can point to.     Basically, at the request of the eldest brother, the three of them go on a train trip through India to reconnect with each other and their spirituality. There are some wonderful moments and the ending is cute but moving and appropriate. Adrien Brody is a nice addition to the Anderson troupe.     I'll be honest - it is a bit annoying that the brothers are filthy rich, and it makes us less sympathetic to their problems and their brooding. And Anderson's characters' brooding does get a bit old at times. But despite that, I just really found myself liking this movie. I'm a total sucker for his films, and I think this one ranks up with the best of them.

The service in receiving my book was awesome!

B00005JPS7|5.0|There will probably never be a \\"superhero\\" movie that will stand the test-of-time as a full-blown movie CLASSIC.  Could there every be a CITIZEN KANE of some guy in a brightly colored costume flying around saving people?  Probably  not.    But as POPULAR entertainment, some superhero movies offer more pure entertainment snap and sizzle and fun than others.  SPIDERMAN 2 overcame the silliness of the comic-book genre with some genuinely exciting and eye-popping action sequences.  BATMAN BEGINS created a visual feast of a world, and populated it with actors full of gravitas.  Even HELLBOY won out by bringing a tongue-in-cheek attitude to the whole thing.  But for me (and I'm NOT a real \\"fan-boy\\"), IRON MAN is the most well-rounded effort in this genre that I've yet seen.  The highest complement I can think to pay is that when I left the theater, I was ready to see more IRON MAN movies right away.  I  was so thoroughly enjoying myself that I wasn't ready to leave yet.    This is due in HUGE part to the splendid performance from Robert Downey Jr.  Certainly the least likely superhero casting since Michael Keaton donned Batman's tight garb...but also perhaps the most inspired.  Downey is convincing as Tony Stark, the brilliant, hedonistic and fabulously wealthy arms manufacturer.  Stark pops with Downey's trademark under his breath, quickly mumbled jabs and bursts of wit.  He's on edge, always on the go.  We can see that his mind is moving a mile a minute...juggling a dozen things at once.  Downey's intelligence is palpable...and so is his devil-may-care-attitude.  It's nearly perfect for Stark.  And the good thing about IRON MAN is that he's really a \\"weapon\\" designed and built by a brilliant man...not a super-power brought on by circumstance from a spider bite.     Early in the film, Stark is visiting Afghanistan to show off a new weapon.  He's soon kidnapped and nearly killed by a Taliban-like band of terrorists, who hold him hostage and force him to build a copy of his latest weapon.  Instead, with the help of a fellow prisoner (a doctor who both saves his life and dooms him to a lifetime of heart problems)...Stark brazenly builds an escape mechanism.    I really hate to give away more plot...because it's fun to watch the story unwind.  Downey is fully of great energy, and could carry the movie on his own.  Fortunately for us, we've also got Gweneth Paltrow (Stark's unfortunately named assistant Pepper Potts).  Paltrow has been away for a few years raising a family (GREAT for her!), but I'd nearly forgotten that in the right role, she can really be a lot of \\"saucy\\" fun.  It's a clichéd role, but she makes the most of it.  Jeff Bridges is Stark's business-partner (and later nemesis), Obadiah Stane.  (Great name.)  Bridges is shaved bald, but has a big beard...making him a striking figure.  He's smooth, silky and creepy.  Shaun Taub, who was SO good in THE KITE RUNNER, is Stark's fellow prisoner, and he does another masterful job portraying a wise older gentleman with a streak of frisky humor and a big soft spot.  He's a very good character actor, and I hope to see more of him.    Two fairly minor quibbles with the film.  1)  Terrance Howard, as Tony's longtime friend and military liaison...is somewhat lost in his role.  To me, it's now been awhile since he gave a performance that did much for me.  He's not fulfilling his early promise.  2)  The film needs a little more action.  This is also a back-handed compliment.  For once, the flying character actually looks fairly convincing...and I wanted to enjoy more pure thrills.  I love the witty banter, the crackling dialogue and I liked the action scenes.  I wanted just a bit more of Iron Man blowing stuff up.  Don't get me wrong, it's not like this movie is stuffy and unexciting...it's just that the action was just so much fun, I actually wanted more  (unlike the action in an overstuffed film like PIRATES 3, for example...where I was craving a break!).    So while this movie is ONLYpopular entertainment...it's the best kind.  Fun, fast, witty, exciting and well-acted.  And with Robert Downey firmly in charge...it's a far cut above the average.  Absolutely for \\"non-fans\\" too!!
B0015D3Z4O|3.0|This isn't a bad CD if it was sung by Nelly Furtado or a 20-something teenybopper but Madonna isn't a teenybopper so it's embarrassing at it's best and cringe inducing at it's worst.     Confessions On A Dancefloor was successful because Madonna revisited her dance roots, paying homage to herself and other dance artists. For those who remembered Madonna back in the day, we could appreciate  the subtle nods to dance artists like SOS Band, Tom Tom Club and Abba.  It was a contemporary, adult directed dance album that also appealed to the 20-something set.  Hard Candy is the complete opposite.  Madonna is trying to appeal to a younger, hipper crowd thus alienating the older set who have grown up with her.  I'm not a fan of the Top 40 teeny bopper fare that is regurgitated on MTV and the radio, so I'm not a fan of Hard Candy.    This is Madonna's weakest effort to date.   I expect Madonna to try new and different things with each release but she could do better than this. Perhaps it's her mid-life crisis CD. The album sounds murky and over produced.  The beats are tinny, echoey and cheap to the point that I thought something was wrong with my stereo at first listen.  And don't get me started on the Justin Timberlake and Kanye  West collaborations. Oh my God!  It's hard to believe this is the same Madonna who gave us Ray of Light, her most mature, introspective and consistent album to date.   Three stars for Candy Shop, Heartbeat, and the Missy Elliot inspired beats of Spanish Lesson, the only sugary pieces of Hard Candy I can swallow.
B000002AH7|4.0|It's a good album, kind of boring because here Miles doesn't shows what he is.
B000Y7U98C|3.0|I bought this and [[ASIN:B0018SJ96O Full Circle]] at the same time, I guess I was in a martial arts mood. I just couldnt get into this movie, it was so unrealistic and cheesy even for a movie! I loved Full Circle alot thank God, so it made up for it.
B000002UQJ|5.0|Often overshadowed by Flowers in the Dirt, Off the Ground is more entertaining from beginning to end. It lacks the \\"My Brave Face\\" big hit single, but never falls below respectability. And the singles like \\"Hope of Deliverance\\" and \\"Off the Ground\\" are among McCartney's catchiest.
B00005JPNY|1.0|Short and sweet:  If you value your (or your children's) spiritual health, you will first do your homework on this collection of \\"fantasy fiction\\" and find out about its author's underlying motives: to prosletyze the unwitting into throwing away faith and all that is good and wholesome according to a loving God.  But don't just take my word for it... go do the research for yourself!    Peace.
0670018651|4.0|I don't just like fragrance, I am OBSESSED with it. Portioning part of my monthly income to one or two fragrances, spending the majority of my time on the computer on fragrance blogs and sites. That said, I don't believe you have to be a fragrance fanatic to enjoy this book. I do think, however, that you need a thicker skin than some people who have found themselves offended by this book for some reason. Luca Turin and Tania Sanchez have both high praise as well as blaring scorn for some of my favorite fragrances. This does not bother me a whit. I have immense respect for Turin and Sanchez but I also understand they are critics. They are more than entitled to their opinions, especially considering their knowledge and expertise in the industry. I am delighted that they have come out with this (mostly) comprehensive book of perfume reviews. I have been waiting for something like this since I really became involved with fragrance as a teenager. And that they have actually made this witty and fun to read as well as useful is a bonus.    The only reasons I give this four stars are as follows: 1) I find the star rating system a bit confusing compared to the reviews (as others have stated) - but I believe they mean to give stars according to the technical feats achieved in the making of the perfume. The review is more informative and useful than the rating. But follow whatever method seems to work for you. 2) I do wish they had included the notes with each review. I know perfumers dimiss the pyramid of top, middle and base notes, but it is helpful to us laypersons. (I'm sure this would have made the book twice as long.) 3) I know this is really too much to ask for, but I also wish discontinued fragrances could have been included as well. That is another book entirely, which I hope will be forthcoming!  A thoroughly entertaining and informative read. I will keep a copy in my handbag at all times now.
1423101464|5.0|This is the fourth installment of the Percy Jackson series, and the most engrossing since the first one. Percy Jackson and his friends try to explore the Labyrinth in order to find the inventor Daedalus and prevent Kronos from controlling the Labyrinth. This book has a lot of the humor of the first three installments, but it does take itself serious at times. A lot of the plot threads like Pan finally come to end. I am glad that the series has not run out of steam, and I wait steadily for the final installment.
B0011FDVKE|5.0|This is an outstanding album, best I have heard this year. Gorgeous, restrained vocals; intelligent, sensitive lyrics; and a first rate backup band combine to make this a rare and rewarding musical experience. Outstanding audio quality as well. If you have not heard Tift Merrett before, this is an excellent, accessible intro; if you have, I think you will find this a major step forward in her musical evolution.    Neal G.
B0011NVC9I|5.0|Nice collection..couldn't find a Director's Cut in Singapore. glad that i bought it from amazon. Nice movie..stunning CGI that will make real actors obsolete if they go on making movie like this in future..I watch this DVD over and over on my HD TV..simply awesome visual feast...
0452289963|5.0|I love this book.  I am an accredited Journey Practitioner and it is very complementary to The Journey by Brandon Bays.  I would recommend anyone who likes this book to read that one as well.  I went to all of the seminars from the journey and the No Ego Seminar is just like this book.  I find both to be very inspirational, thought provoking, calming, and grounding.    In this book, the first 1 or 2 chapters are a little difficult to get through but once you are through those it is absolutely amazing.
B000J233SK|5.0|When you want to chill out, this is the music you need.  It is very soothing to the soul.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|Persuasion is my favorite Jane Austen story and this movie does the story justice.  The acting is suburb with the exception of Mary & Elizabeth who overdo a bit.  Although it does not remain true with the novel in the strictest sense, Miss Austen's concepts remain true...they get their second chance.  Very touching movie filmed at great locations.
B00003CXA6|3.0|This movie is based on the book \\"The Killer Angels\\" which is an awesome work of art (Pulitzer Prize winning novel).  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND reading the book thoroughly before attempting to watch this movie.  The book is flat out phenomenal.  The movie, on the other hand, was disappointing for me.  I'll try to explain why I thought so.  First of all, the acting in this movie is not the best work done by the actors that appear in the movie, most of whom have impressive resumes.  The way Martin Sheen portrays Robert E. Lee makes one wonder how this General could have achieved such a lofty reputation.  I think Sheen was off base in his effort here.  Tom Berenger, however, plays a great General Longstreet.  The fake beards in the movie are terrible and hard to over-look as you're watching it and trying to follow this gripping story.  You almost can't stop yourself from laughing at the makeup.  The movie itself is very long, around 4 hours, and you have to flip the DVD over after viewing the first half, which in itself is not a problem, but I would think that the director could include more important scenes in a movie of that length than some of the scenes left in.  For example, I would have liked the movie to explore the interaction between Lee and Longstreet AFTER the battle (which the book does some).  This movie is hard to follow if you haven't read the book and already have an idea where the story is going.  The movie jumps around and it is easy for the first time viewer to get lost and not understand where the movie is going as it bounces around from one side of the battle to the other and from one character to another.  The movie makers didn't do a good enough job transitioning from scene to scene to keep the audience clued in to what was happening and why a particular chain of events was important to the story and the outcome. If you are a true civil war \\"buff\\" I definitely think you should watch the movie, but don't expect a masterpiece or a great piece of work.  Movies are NEVER as good as the books they are based upon.  It seems that the acting in this movie is \\"wooden\\" with the actors reading from pages of script, as if hurried along to get finished.  The way the scenes were shot gives the movie an \\"artificial\\" feel as if they are on a stage with a bunch of props and as a result the movie doesn't feel \\"realistic\\".  It seems as though you are watching a re-enactment instead of actual events (other war movies escape this trap and make the audience feel they are watching the actual event).  In summary, I'm glad I watched it but I thought it could have been better.  This movie is average at best.
0393974987|4.0|In some ways this is a hard book to get into since it is set in a totally different culture from ours -rural England of the mid-nineteenth century.  You would think that that is close enough in time to not be a problem.  But to me the things like their courtship customs, or what is considered scandalous/honorable behavior, are really at a variance with the way we act today that I found it hard to relate to.  Add to this some of the implausible melodrama and coincidences that make up the plot and I almost ended up putting down the book.<br /><br />However I kept reading and in the end I thought it was an excellent story.  This is because it illustrated a truth about life that I could empathize with.  How a man through pride, anger, stubbornness and alcoholism could end up destroying his relationships with all of the people he is close to and in middle age end up being alienated from everyone who was important to him in his life. Since this story was written there have been millions of guys like Michael Henchard.  The details of their lives are different, their endings may have been different.  But there is an underlying truth that is the same.  That aspect of the story is timeless.
0553805460|5.0|It's hard to believe this is Belfort's first book.  It is exceptionally well written and grips you from the first page.  The book details Belfort's rise and fall as a financial tycoon.  He was a self made multi-millionare who managed to risk it all thru risky trading schemes.  But what's more astounding is what he put his body through along the way, abusing every drug imaginable and engaging in wreckless behavior.  It's a candid story of his rise, fall, and recovery.  In the end, you're left astounded that he managed to survive and tell the tale.
B000067J1Y|5.0|No spoof does it quite like this anymore.  Hot Shots is a megaload of witty jokes that is easily taken for granted by most critics.  Scripting for spoofs has changed dramatically overtime.  Nowadays it seems as if these spoofs are written over the weekend.  Back in the 90's people put a lot more time and effort into developing a winning comedy.  If you watch the special features, you will find that each actor really gave solid effort to the film.  The all-star cast does not have a weak spot at all.  Bridges (RIP) is on top of his game.  Sheen is witty and classic in this one.  Cary Elwes makes a great appearance in this film, as well as Brook's Robin Hood.  (Please see some Mel Brooks films if you enjoy spoofs).  Ryan Stiles needs more camera time, and Jon Cryer needed to come back for the sequel. I need to rent Top Gun one more time to appreciate Hot Shots! more, but by itself, the film really stands tall as an outrageous comedy. If you want to see more of Sheen or Lloyd Bridges, then see where the comedy began.  Hot Shots! is one of the best spoof classics out there.
0452289963|5.0|I have never read anything that instantly helped me move into a new area of thought and existance.  To realize that you are in control of your own mind can be dangerous to existing institutions like government and organized religion, but it is necessary if humankind is to survive those very institutions that are trapped in limbic regions of their brains and now threatening to destroy the planet because of their fear-based actions.  \\"Eye for an eye\\" doesn't work anymore.  Evolve or die - that's Tolle's on-point message.  And amazingly, it has been with us in the very bible that now threatens to destroy us - through teachings that are mostly ignored by the media and our leaders.  I found the book an easy and delightful read and the wonderful by-product is that my awareness has shifted and I'm flexing those new muscles more each day.  I'm becoming more aware of when my ego tries to influence me and through that am able to make more enlightened decisions in my daily life.  Surely critical mass is right around the corner thanks to Tolle and Winfrey doing everything they can to share this book with the masses all over the world!  It does not replace religion, it enhances spirituality.  The only part of the \\"old-time religion\\" that should be threatened are the church leaders who thrive on fear and hate and greed.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I bought this DVD on a dare by my employees who are in their 20's and 30's.  There are three levels and I have only tried Level 1.  It is a very challenging workout, but not complicated.  I am dripping in sweat when I am done.  This is not for the meek.  Jillian \\"takes no prisoners.\\"  I would not have believed that I could get such a good workout in such a short time.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|First, I am a Firefly fan.  My dream would be for the show to continue for another 4-5 seasons to complete the ongoing plot elements of the series, and develop the character relationships to their potential.  This didn't happen despite fan support, and I have stopped hoping.  That said, Serenity was the next best thing.  The movie is faster, darker, and made for a whole different audience.  I enjoyed the subtle overlaps and variations that made the movie stand alone.  It was more disturbing, graphic, violent, and fly by the seat of your pants exciting.  It is an entertaining blend of Western and Space adventures for folks with an open mind.  The movie answers many (but not all) remaining questions from the show, but allows room for future tales.  The epic conclusion was a poignent ending to a great story.  I loved it, but personally prefer the more comfortable setting of the TV show: [[ASIN:B0000AQS0F Firefly - The Complete Series]]
B000VKJ6VS|4.0|I can't say enough how much I like this album! While it's not the greatest thing since sliced bread and certainly nothing new (thus the 4 stars), it continues to grown on me and by the 2nd listen I already knew it was superior not only to their first release but to everything Creed ever did.<br /><br />It seems that getting rid of vain poser boy Sapp is exactly what these 3 guys needed, too bad they aren't as big as that band was; yet!! And I must say I have always liked Tremonti's guitar playing, the single greatest asset this band has (though there's certainly nothing wrong with the vocals either!!) If they continue to evolve in this way I can't WAIT to hear the 3rd and 4th albums.<br /><br />Ties That Bind, Come to Life, Brand New Start, One By One, White Knuckles and the title track are ones on my MP3 player but there's not a bad track on the whole thing!! If you don't like this, you just don't like rock, it's that simple!
0930289234|5.0|If You've Never Read This... Well, for the comic book lover then it's a must read. It's funny how often I run into someone who reads comics that hasn't read it. This is a staple, must read book...<br /><br />Having said that, modern comic book readers will be reminded how much better comic book art and coloring looks now compared to when this was released. (Not that Dave Gibbons is not great because he is, but the look of comics has greatly improved) Also, this was groundbreaking when it was first published, now it's quite common to see SuperHeroes with so many flaws. Still, when you read something like Ultimates, it's important to know who first crafted such a tale.<br /><br />Despite any disclaimer I may lay on a young, modern comic book reader who has no memory of newspaper print paper, limited color pallet or any idea what a thought baloon is... Watchmen is still the most amazingly crafted example of comic book art ever. This story never moved me much emotionally, but amazed me at how it was crafted, and made me as an adult believe in superheroes again.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|This book begins from a very silly premise - what if zombies were real? - and then \\"plays it straight\\" by presenting a survival manual which is written as if the author was deadly serious about their existence. As a result, the book is a marvelous example of deadpan humor, and I can recommend it to anyone who has an interest in the horror genre, or in any survival or \\"how-to\\" manuals.    The Kindle edition of the book does not suffer from any major problems with its layouting, though there are some minor issues. For one, there is often no true \\"break\\" before the headlines of the next sub-chapter - an empty line before the headlines would have improved the text flow a bit. For another, the publisher was somewhat sloppy when converting the black-and-white drawings - the conversion resulted in a step pattern along the lines known as the \\"alias\\" effect. This doesn't really make them unrecognizable - fortunately, the drawings were pretty simple to begin with - but it is annoying and would have been entirely avoidable with some care if the publisher had been a bit more careful.    But these are only minor issues and not serious enough to subtract a star from the overall rating.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|UNBELIEVABLE...actually...that's exactly right...this is a spoof. I can't believe Al Gore would talk like this if he wasn't kidding. If you do the research, you'll find that the globe has been cooling(!!!) for some time...get a clue peeps!
B000002G1Y|5.0|This is one of those albums that hits you in the chest and leaves you breathless.  A mix of bluesy/rock angst compiled with lyrics that provoke thought and emotion drive this album.  Hiatt has never been short on talent but this album was a breakthrough on so many levels.  There are so few albums of this caliber on the market.  That also helps Hiatt ascend to the top with GUITAR.  This album will leave you wanting more, not because Hiatt hasn't done his job, but because so many others don't.  The HIGHEST recommendation!
B00154GEFU|2.0|Maybe I'm just a greedy b***h, but I expected more(a lot more) from the BIGGEST Prog-Rock Supergroup. This is like a time travelling hockey team, led by Wayne Gretsky and Art Ross missing the NHL playoffs by 2 points. It's undoubtedly a good album, but this band seemed to expend it's load on their first disc, \\"Asia\\". Four unbelievable talents, who seem to just be going through the motions. Better than most of what's on the market today, but why stay so close to the bar, when the bar is set so low?? Money? Perhaps...the original Asia doesn't have to try hard to get mine.  Not sure if it's worth another listen...Peace
B0006B7MS6|5.0|This product is outstanding, just the way I remember it. I would recommend this product to any Charlston Heston fan.
B000IFQLBE|1.0|Like many of you, I loved CCR. The songs were relics of the past and well crafted. They were played at a very slow tempo, and that was a crucial part of their flavour and mystique.    Now we have this live recording called the \\"Long Road Home\\". It is obvious that John has aged. He can no longer carry the notes or the inflection that he did in CCR. So be it.      But, what I can not get past on this album is the frantic speed at which every song is played. The material loses its authenticity and becomes little more than a night out for those who wish to live in the past.
B0013FFMOK|2.0|I am a long time fan of Will Smith, and enjoyed Richard Matheson's novel \\"I am Legend\\".  I thought the combination of the two would be a little bit of heaven.  The first half of the movie met, and exceeded, my expectations for a decimated world populated by feral humans, and Will Smith.  Exciting, with amazing visuals, and Will Smith's portrayal of the last man on Earth - Neville.  Torn by loneliness; racked by horror at the terrible turn his efforts to help humankind took; and survivor's guilt.  The efforts to live day to day, and the constant fear wearing away at Neville's humanity.  The first half of the movie is electric!  The last half of the movie is so bad, it seems that a different movie was tacked onto the end.<br /><br />SPOILERS----SPOILERS----SPOILERS<br /><br />Those infected with the virus are not shown until half way through the movie.  The director was wise to take the \\"Jaws\\" approach in not showing the antagonists, as their appearance is more cartoony than frightening.  The infected people have the energy level, and attitude, of an angry house cat, with the appearance of, well, hairless CG people.  The director always uses the startle factor to introduce the infected onto the screen.  Probably because the infected aren't particularly startling in, and of, themselves.  At least one of the infected show that they are capable of higher thought, through cunning and tool use, but for some reason - a) Neville does not seem to notice this fact, even though he is a victim of it; and b) the infected folks ability to do more than scream, run, and eat is abruptly dropped from the film, as though it had never happened.<br /><br />The human acting performances in the second half of the film go from 60 to zero in 10 seconds.  There is a lot of staring between the actors at this point.  Perhaps, they were emoting, but it came across as simply staring.  Lifeless.  Boring.  Kind of silly.  The movie finally ends (thank goodness) with a big unhappy (Boom!), and a big happy (Hurray. We're not alone.).<br /><br />The movie starts as a fast-paced roller coaster ride, and ends as a slow, dull, still photo.  The first half of the film is 5 star, all the exciting way!  The second half of the film is minus 7 stars, all the boring way.  Overall, a 2 star; don't-waste-your-money; just-catch-it-on-television; film.t alone.).

B0010YSD7M|5.0|I can only say one thing AMAZING!!!  Can we ask WHY this show was cancelled or set out to pasture????  I'm glad to hear that they will continue Stargate via direct to DVD because the story, special effects and the cast truly are one of the best in Sci-Fi.
B00005JPNY|5.0|As a viewer that hasn't read the book yet, I enjoyed this film very much.  So much so that I have already purchased the books so that I can get the full picture and continue the tale.  There are very few films that can match the quality and story of the novel they are based on.  So, it's important to keep expectations at a reasonable level.  Hundreds of pages do not shrink to less than 2 hours without losing something.  After speaking with some of my friends who read the book, I think they kept to the spirit of the story if not the letter.  Ironically, the film made far more money in Europe where the books are much more popular.  However, I wasn't watching this for life lessons or implied religious themes.  I wanted an interesting story, engaging characters and a fun adventure.  They delivered all three with some awesome special effects to boot!<br /><br />The acting by the adults in the film was a little over the top, but fit with the grand adventure style of story-telling.  I completely bought Nicole Kidman as a snobby elitist who lives by \\"the ends justify the means.\\"  I liked that good actors were placed even in bit roles (such as Sam Elliot), but the young star and the animals truly stole the show.  Lyra's character will appeal to fans of Hermione Granger and other smart little rebels.  I found myself cheering for her and her daemon.  The producers did a great job with the talking animals.  They blended with the story very well.  I never felt like they were zooming in on every animal every time - \\"see, the animals are talking!\\"  This helped them feel more like characters in the movie than CGI stunts.  The dialog between Lyra and Pan was much like between any two good friends at that age.  And I loved the polar bear.  Who wouldn't get excited about a massive polar bear wearing armor!?  And voiced by Ian McKellan, priceless.  The subject matter is a little more grave than other movies of this genre.  The PG-13 rating was deserved, though much less so than movies like \\"Alien vs Predator\\"!  The ending was a little abrupt, but seeing as it's based on the first book of a trilogy, I can't complain.  The filmakers didn't leave viewers with a killer cliffhanger, just in case the second film isn't made (which I truly hope it is).<br /><br />This 2-disc DVD set is nice.  The extra features have a nice variety with your usual \\"making of\\" and behind the scenes stuff, but also a feature on the book and adaptation.  The packaging is standard, though I really like the outer sleeves that so many special editions come with these days.  There is no chapter insert - just an advertisement for the World Wildlife Fund and their promotion based on the film (adopt plush animals that represent endangered animals depicted in the film).  I'm happy I bought the 2-disc set.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this was an entertaining film, with great special effects and a unique story.  I am glad I bought the DVD as I will certainly rewatch it.  Though I missed seeing this in the theatre, I would definitely see the sequel on the big screen.  Highly recommended to movie fans who haven't read the book and love a good adventure, and book fans who are open-minded about adaptations.ien vs Predator\\"!

0312379293|5.0|I have not previously read any of Mr. Archer's many novels. That will be corrected in short order.    \\"A Prisoner of Birth\\" is simply a wonderful read. The story is masterfully crafted, the characters are extremely well developed, and the story moves logically, yet with a perfectly exact number of surprises. This novel resulted in a couple of laugh out loud moments for this reader and a few: \\"atta boys\\" when things went well.    The original plot of man wrongly convicted has been done many, many times before, but rarely, if ever, with such aplomb.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Simply the most amazing series on wild life. The scenes are breathtaking and will give you a new appreciation for life on earth. I would recommend this very highly.
B0013BNY2Q|1.0|This album MIGHT be good but the recording sound quality is so atrocious, I can't tell!! In this day and age when anyone with just a PC can create fantastic recordings, there is NO excuse for this abomination and assault on our ears and wallets. Perhaps it is because a vast majority of music is listened to on tinny little earphones, people have got used to lousy sound.... This album sounds like it's underwater. All the tracks seem to come out of one channel (no, all my stereos are not broken!) and it is impossible to discern any one track from all the others jumbled into the output... VERY disappointing. If I could, I would rate this a negative 5 stars for just this reason. To sell this junk as CD quality audio is just thievery. It might work in low bit-rate MP3 format but certainly NOT for CD
B000XPU5NY|3.0|Live Over Europe is just another live album in the Genesis pantheon.  The music is, as always, extremely professional.  The songs are all recognizable favorites.    However...they didn't need to record and release this concert.  As others have mentioned, the downtuning is oddly disturbing most of the time.  Some of the tunes are quite sluggish.  The song selection...    ...Is boring.  They gave us NOTHING that hasn't been done before, and done better.  It's almost as if this is a rehash of the mediocre The Way We Walk CDs.  The songs that might have been interesting are only SHORTENED versions that leave us wondering.  Come on guys, change the set list up a bit.  You've got plenty to choose from.    If you want a live Genesis record, this should be your last choice.  Seconds Out is the best, IMO.  If you want Gabriel era, your choices are limited to Archive vol. 1 and Live (1973).  Other Collins era available include Three Sides Live, Archive vol. 2, and The Way We Walk vol.s 1 and 2.  Get any, or all, of these before getting Live Over Europe.

B0012E6R3W|4.0|After dealing with a close call, (cancer neraly claimed singer Chuck Billy), Testament took a looooong time coming back. Had things gone any other way, would Alex Skolnick be back? Doubtful.    This album is meat and potatoes Testament, a mixture of \\"Low\\", \\"The Gathering\\" and elements of their \\"Practice What you Preach\\" heyday. Chuck sounds very powerful, like a vocalist going from strength to strength. Really, the only thing that this album is lacking is the full-bore speed blasts that made \\"The Gathering\\" so above and beyond aggressive.    I highly recommend this album, it was $12 well spent, and it is damn good to see this band back in the game. Match point--Metallica had better drag every once of strength from their arsenal to beat this album!!
B000NOKA0S|5.0|This was Leonard Cohen's first album, and it's an amazing album.  It's filled with some of his best songs ever, songs that sound new everytime you listen to him.  It starts with one of his signature songs, Suzanne.  Surprisingly, it's not about a lost love or a current love, but a woman of impeccable taste and hospitality.  I especially love The Stranger Song, which grows more brooding and profound every time I listen to it.  Sisters of Mercy, So Long, Marianne, and Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye are three other songs that are truly endearing.  This is the beginning of the amazing journey for Cohen, as most of his work has been surprisingly consistent and always worth listening to.  Many times when an artist has a great debut, he burns out afterwards.  Not Leonard.  He's aging most gracefully.<br /><br />An interesting note to cinema buffs.  Many of these songs are featured in Robert Altman's masterful McCabe and Mrs. Miller, and the song Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye is featured in Werner Herzog's Fata Morgana.<br /><br />Essential listening from one of Canada's greatest men.

006135323X|3.0|Ariely studies the way we make decisions. And his \\"startling\\" conclusion is that, while we think we are rational, we make decisions for all sorts of irrational reasons.<br /><br />Tada!<br /><br />While some of the observations are no-brainers, the detailed mechanics of how we make decisions (when provided) can be very interesting. For example, he talks about how we have a hard time deciding between two different things (e.g., a colonial house and a modern one), but if we have three things to choose from, and one is a defective version of another (e.g., a colonial house, a colonial house with a leaking roof, and a modern one), we tend to have an easier time, choosing the thing that is not defective, but has a defective version (e.g., the intact colonial house). Also, in general, our sense of what things are worth can be dependent on an unrelated number we have in our head (a price anchor).<br /><br />The book as a whole is conversational and jokey (irritatingly so, sometimes) but offers some interesting ideas to chew on.<br /><br />A quick read.

B0015XASFS|5.0|If you don't own any Josh Groban concert DVD, this is a must have. The sound quality as well as the picture are incredibly pristine. There is so much energy in this DVD, and his voice has the ability to pull you away from reality for 90 minutes. Song choices were superb, it guides you through his career and builds your energy for the finale. \\"Pearls\\" had such a strong message and performed with an indefinite amount of heart, soul, and power. That alone was worth owning the disk.  I own all of his DVD, and this is by far, the best representation of Josh's talent and personality! Enjoy it everyone!

B0010VD7EO|3.0|Ok, so I am more of a Justin Timberlake kind of guy, but I do like some techno and dance as well.  I was surprised by Oracular Spectacular because all-in-all, there was some decent tracks on here.  It's not something where I think the entire CD was worth it, but about 3 of the tracks I did enjoy.  I would suggest that this album is for people who are more into the alternative scene than electronic pop.
B0015KO52S|2.0|I'm writing this review from the seemingly rare viewpoint of someone who is a big fan of Brendan Benson's rather than Jack White's. I've been a fan a brendan's since his first record came out nearly ten years ago. I was excited about the first Raconteurs record and really liked it, though not as much as Brendan's solo albums. I've never really been a White Stripes fan but I still liked Jack's contributions to Broken Boy Soldiers. What I liked most about his songs and why I think I like them better than almost every White Stripes song I've ever heard was that he was singing really well! We wasn't doing his high pitched cackly whine that is so prevailant on White Stripes albums. Now comes Consolers of the Lonely and I just don't like it. For lack of a better description it's \\"too Jack\\". He's singing like it's a White Stripes record again and I just can't listen to an entire album of that. Sadly, even Brendan's offering don't grab me. There are some songs that I kinda like, such as \\"Many Shades of Black\\" and \\"Hold Up\\" to name a couple. Overall the energy and pace of the record is far greater compared to the somewhat slower Broken Boy Soldiers, but the song structures sound underdeveloped and just kinda chaotic. All the country influence on the record just tends to sound contrived and as if it's just there in an attempt to be cool and different. So, it's a total let down for me. I really hope Brendan gets back to his solo work sooner than later. I'd rather even hear new a Greenhornes record than whatever the Racs do next.
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|Braveheart is one of those films that I have watched every year or so since it came out on VHS. I have bought two DVD versions now as well.<br /><br />On the one hand it is such a violent and bloody movie, I would normally have had all I needed with one viewing, but on the other hand, even with the unbelievable heroism on the part of the protagonist, it is a moving tale of Honor, National Pride, and even ethnic pride (even though my family is Welsh and My wife's Irish, I still feel for the courage in the stories of the Celts of all persuasions).<br /><br />I really loved some of the speeches in the film, one of my favorites was a short rebuke to the Scottish Nobles, \\"You think the people exist to serve the Nobility, but the Nobility exist to serve Scotland\\" (or something close to that) but the message is true for politicians and leaders and managers in every land. Leadership is the serving and protection of those we lead, not vice-versa.<br /><br />But the main thing is for me is the overall message of the film, without freedom there is no living. I have to be in the right mood, but this remains one of my all time favorites.
B0011KQSZ4|4.0|If you are a huge fan of British Films/Humor and dark comedies in general, then you like this film a lot. It is both silly and outrageous, yet has some over the top hilarious scenes not to be missed. Who knew events at a funeral could be so funny!!
B0010YSD7M|2.0|It was billled as the tie that will bind up the loose ends for our favorite air force special ops known as SG-1, and conclude the epic delima caused by the malicious Ori. While I enjoyed the acting and energy the cast placed into the story, it was the story that I felt most dissapointed on. While I can understand that adressing all elements of the story arc with the Ori is next to impossible, I was most dissapointed with the final show down with Adria. Without giving away any spoilers for those who have not seen the film, I'll just say they solved the problem with her by using \\"Magic Wizards\\"- A translation of this means that what was supposed to be a big, all out, triumph for the SG-1 and those who were plagued by Adria and her minions, ultimatly was not. I felt as if the writers wrote themselvs into a corner and when they could't get out of it, they brought in a supernatural force that was used minmally to toot the victory horn, hence, when you can't explain it well or don't know what to do, use Magic Wizards. They can end any story and get any hero out of a bind, magically. You know, it's sci- fi, anything can happen, right? So while I loved the characters and their job, I blame poor writing and \\"Magic Wizards \\" for the flop at the finish line called the Ark of Truth.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|Brothers in Arms, fueled by \\"Money for Nothing,\\" probably sold 10 times as many copies, but for my money, this is the best effort of Mark Knopfler and his band, and one that has stood the test of time.  Both the playing and songwriting is inspired throughout (other than the closing \\"Les Boys\\", which gave a hint of the novelty songs that were to come later), which can't be said for all of their other cd's.  There are plenty of details in other reviews, but one point I haven't seen in the more recent reviews is that as I recall from Knopfler's interviews at the time, the song \\"Romeo & Juliet,\\" while obviously presented through the classic romance characters, was actually inspired by a real failed romance that Knopfler had tried to rekindle.  There's certainly no doubt about the emotion in his delivery of the lyrics in the middle of the song.

B00008G9JN|5.0|This 1977 release presents a fine mixture of harder edged progressive rock and early English folk music that the group has maintained to this very day.  Overall, this is another of my favorites from Jethro Tull and presents the band firing on all cylinders; especially after the \\"not-so-well-received\\" album Too Old to Rock n' Roll, Too Young to Die (1976).<br /><br />The players on Songs from the Wood include Ian Anderson (flute, acoustic guitar, mandolin, whistles, vocals, all instruments on Jack-in-the-Green), Martin Barre (electric guitar and lute), Barriemore Barlow (drums, marimba, glockenspiel, bells), John Glascock (bass, vocals), John Evans (piano, organ and synthesizers) and David Palmer (piano, portative organ and synthesizers).  This is a great lineup and John Glascock and Barriemore Barlow are simply fantastic throughout.<br /><br />The nine tracks on the album range in length from 2:27 to 8:38 and range from purely acoustic tracks heavily influenced by early English folk music, to more progressive pieces that feature great ensemble work, tasteful synthesizer and organ playing and (on occasion) hard-edged electric guitar playing by Martin.  Although the heavier, proggier tracks like Hunting Girl are very satisfying, I especially appreciated the quieter, folksier pieces on the album.  Overall, I found that the use of traditional folk instruments including the lute and mandolin along with the various and sundry bits of percussion added a rich, earthy texture to the music.<br /><br />Like some other folks here, I have owned this album in one form or other for the past umpteen million years.  This remastered album is something special though.  The remastered CD features breathtaking sonic clarity, lyrics, photos and additional liner notes.  However, although the bonus studio track Beltane is pleasant enough and I enjoyed the live version of Velvet Green, I was more than pleased with the tunes included on the original album.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great album that presents some excellent material from one of my favorite periods in the career of this group.  I did like this remastered CD and found that it was a suitable replacement for my (long gone) vinyl LP.  For those folks that liked Songs from the Wood, the follow-up Heavy Horses (1978) is also pretty good and more or less maintains this approach. Highly recommended.xcellent material from one of my favorite periods in the career of this group.

B000000H57|5.0|Let me start by saying that I'm no newcomer to music. My first album was Led Zeppelin's \\"Led Zeppelin.\\" I got that album in the summer of 1972 from my \\"babysitter.\\" She gave it to me for my 10th birthday.     My second and third ever albums were Deep Purple \\"Machine Head\\" and Alice Cooper's \\"School's Out.\\"    I saw Van Halen's debut tour with Black Sabbath in 1978.    I saw the KISS reunion Tour #1 in I think around 1995 or 96, whenever their first retour took off, at the Great Western in LA, CA.    Anyway, I've seen a lot of bands, old and new, and I've been around rock for years.    I'd never heard of this band until a younger friend of mine, 26, turned me on to them about three days ago. He gave me \\"World Coming Down\\" and I about crapped my pants. He then gave me this album, \\"October Rust.\\"    These guys were refreshing in that their sound is unique. That's an understatement. Yes, they remind me of Christian Death or Bauhaus, but  I never thought either of those two quite pulled it off, although I have a profound respect for both bands. I guess I could say the same thing for Type O, but just trust me and other reviewers here: If you want something refreshing and original, with a sound that will blow you away, get \\"World Coming Down,\\" or this album.     I can't give any other review except to say that the goth, gloom hits an all time high here. There are no fast guitar speed metal riffs or berserk drum beats, but the beats immersed me in an incredible world of ebb and flow, up and down, rich, strong, moving ranges. In other words, they never bored me.    If you have never heard anything by this band--you won't be sorry.    By the way, the instrumentals and vocal really do deserve a good system to fully appreciate, and enjoy, this quite unique sound. It's not really something you want to listen to on a boom box. A good set of earphones and a nice transparent mp3 or similar file will do the trick, but to FULLY appreciate the sound, listen to it on a system where youcan actually feel the bass and other lows in your chest. I'd not talking about block away volume. In fact, this music doesn't need to be cranked to enjoy it. It just needs a good system to reproduce it's heavy, back beat, slow, full spectrum energy.
B0002M6QLS|5.0|Daniel is a taxi driver who likes to race cars. Emilien is a cop who just can't seem to pass his driving test. When Emilien catches Daniel speeding, he agrees to overlook this offence if Daniel agrees to act as his chauffer for one month and help him to capture the Mercedes Gang, a group of Germans who have been robbing banks across Europe and then escaping in red Mercedes.    This action-comedy, scripted by Luc Besson (\\"Nikita\\", \\"Leon\\", \\"The Fifth Element\\") is a lot of fun. Judging by the number of French comedies that are remade in English, French humour seems to appeal greatly to English-speaking audiences and this is no exception. It's filled with the sort of French buffoonery that the world loves. Add to that some really great car chases and it's no surprise that this film managed to give rise to three sequels and an American remake. I haven't seen the remake, but I can't imagine that it could be any better than this.
B000JLQSWE|4.0|If memory serves, 'Vulture Culture' fell into the LP/CD transition period, and was first issued (in 1984) in both formats. The CD, however, was strangely lacking in atmosphere in comparison with the vinyl version. For me, this remastered issue restores the clarity, brightness and atmosphere of the original album, and, in keeping with others in the reissue series, adds a lot of previously-unreleased material.    'Vulture Culture' was one of the Project's more topical albums, the title neatly reversing the contemporary 'culture vulture' tag to highlight the contemporary issue of predatory greed. 'Vulture Culture' was the first Project album to lack strings, a key ingredient of previous albums - and later offerings (particularly the excellent 'Gaudi') benefited from the return of Andrew Powell's lush orchestration (I can also strongly recommend the Philharmonia's classical take on the Project, [[ASIN:B0007SO9KC Alan Parsons Project: Played by Andrew Powell]]).     To me, this is not one of the Project's very best albums, but this is a strictly relative judgement - most Project albums (including this one) are far, far ahead of most other artists' material, and earlier albums (such as 'Tales', 'I Robot', 'Pyramid' and 'Eve') set an incredibly hard standard to follow. My view is that the earlier albums were best, then, and that the Project peaked with the superlative 'Turn of a Friendly Card'.     'Vulture Culture' might not (quite) match the earlier albums, but there are some great tracks here - I'd highlight 'Let's Talk About Me', the title track and 'Somebody Out There', whilst almost everyone lauds 'Hawkeye'. This remaster, presenting the album in brighter, more immediate and more atmospheric form, is very welcome.     I must emphasise that awarding only four stars is a purely relative judgement - by any standards other than those of the Project's best albums, 'Vulture Culture' would certainly merit all five.

B000AJJNPY|5.0|the first time i heard of this band was in a little pub where amateur djs played every once in a while. the song was glosoli the second track. i was immediately bedazzled. this band is the most amazing band ive ever heard. the genre is so different from anything ive heard before, comes close to ambient rock mixed with beautiful symphonies and melodies. the music is so beautiful so refreshing it will blow you away, this album is definitely my favorite and none of the tracks are boring or bad. simply a masterpiece
B000P2A256|2.0|I have been reading the seemingly vast amount of reviews for this album and it seems that nobody else is litening to the same album I am.     Maroon 5 has been on of my presonal faves for years, and love their sound. I saw them open for John Mayer and their effortless grove blew me away. Needless to say, I was very eager to pick up the new album, but it turned out to be a bit of a disappointment. It seems that both musically and lyrically, they didn't really have anything new to say, so they just tried to recreat SAJ, harder.     I'll admit the grooves statyed tight or got tighter, but just about everything else on the album is so forced, I can barely stand to listen to it. The increased over-production was like an already-pretty girl slathering on way too much makeup. The lyrics were so over-sexualized that I don't even feel comfortable listening to it by myself. The \\"hooks\\" sound like \\"hooks\\" instead of melodies, and the slower songs are the obvious product of sales strategists amped up on 'She Will Be Loved\\".    One more thing. Fans of The Police should feel insulted, at the very least. Sting probably lost sleep after hearing this one. There are so many blatant, poorly-recreated Police imitations that I had to go back to Synchronicity and set myself right.    Sorry all you positive reviewers, I wish the album had been a suitable follow-up, but it was a contrived effort at best. I may spin a few of the singles, but the album was a letdown. Let's get 'em next time, boys.

B000YKE87W|5.0|CD of Operatic Arias sung by Jonas Kaufman  Fantastisch, wunderbar...I love it.  Mr. Kaufman has a wonderful, rich, voice, he shades it and uses it to bring out the wonder of the arias. At times it is robust, then soave, dolce and, of course, romantic!  I particularly liked the fact that he did not use the same old arias every tenor trots out on a medley of typical \\"favorites\\" i.e La Donne e Mobile.  He is quite \\"dishy\\" as well!  I look forward to more of Jonas Kaufman's work.
B000BTC5LW|3.0|I owned this when it initially came out on VHS, back then I had a 27\\" tube TV and a basic 4 speaker dolby surround sound receiver. Give the 10 years since, I have lost my copy of the tape and have upgraded to a nice 5.1 setup with a 100\\" DLP high def projector.    I was very excited to hear the DVD was finally out and I can re-visit one of my favorite live videos of the 90's!    The very first thing I noticed was how pixilated the image looked, I fiddled with the settings on my projector thinking that was the problem.    i then tried watching it on a smaller 42\\" widescreen and it looked just as bad! The darker scenes, I saw a lot of digital artifacts, for 2004 this was just bad! I felt like I was watching a you tube video blown up on a screen!    That is basically my biggest beef with the DVD, well that and the 4:3 aspect ratio! The footage screams to have a 16:9 presentation.    I understand that the source material wasn't the best to work with, but given the fact that they spred the concert over two disks should have given them more room to work with.    I do love however the 5.1 treatment it got! James Guthrie is an engineering wizard, and the sound does not disappoint.    Granted, this is Pink Floyd Lite and the absence of Roger Waters is felt throughout, and Guy Pratt and his headless bass always annoyed me! But oh well.    Hopefully they will re-release this on Blu-Ray and correct the video quality, this is meant to be seen as clear as possible!

B000Q6GUTI|5.0|Shooter Movie Versus Point of Impact Book:   The Bob Lee Swagger story lines in the book and the movie are different in character building, action, and political satire. Very understandable, screen productions can rarely replicate a book.    Although I hesitate to \\"spill the beans\\" on the movie or the book, the movie is so entertaining that I watch it when nothing else is entertaining, and the Point of Impact book is one of the few books worth reading again (sorry Clancy, Koontz, Coontz, and Ludman).      Shooter Movie:   The movie from director Antoine Fuqua takes the world after 9/11 (El Salvador is not of much interest, but oil is) and he pumps oceans of well oiled political satire, which is at its very best: \\"there are only have and have-nots (Iraq ref)\\", \\"I didn't much like the President before him\\", \\"I still have the shovel (JFK ref),\\" \\"its just human weakness, and you can't kill that with a gun,\\" \\"Exactly!...Bang!\\"     Although the Shooter movie character building could have used another half-hour or more, the character-action building of the movie (if there is such a thing) was superb. Anyway, more time on character building would have put the brakes on the movie. It was one lightning action sequence after another that not even a Die Hard or a Tom Clancy movie could match or even top (and I loved the Hunt for Red October, the Sum of All Fears, Bourne Trilogy, and so on).     The movie plot deviations from the book were very well thought out and made the movie rip and roar through one satisfying scene after another. The long distance shot at the Presidential podium was superior to the book and did a very credible job of integrating Nick Memphis's role and his timely flow throughout the movie.     Antoine Fuqua exploits what I define as the Al Qaeda mind-set (AQMS), which is the same brain dysfunction that people everywhere are wired into, but just use different means that cause different results: the church killing Islamic people and women centuries ago, andraping boys in this century, web video murders/suicide bombers of today's Islamic Terrorists, the previous decades of killing by the KKK, Hitler's killing of more than 6 million Jews...the never ending human carnage, no matter what millennium, from the beginning of testosterone beings or until the end of testosterone beings...I doubt that Homo Sapiens will ever change.     AQMS applies to political character assassinations in DC, where multi-millions (billions this year) are spent by political candidates attempting to destroy the reputation of all other candidates, Congressmen writing bad checks not so long ago, paying for sex, and sucking soft money at the expense of all American citizens.     AQMS applies to Enron and many others, to Mortgage banks and their infamous ARMs (the Fed is now rewarding them at our expense, with proper spin), and the Medical establishment in the movie \\"Sicko\\" by Michael Moore. It is one-sided negative-news from the media, harping on one murder after another. It is the negative consumption syndrome of the general common-denominator population that tunes in for all the sick TV shows (most of them), puts up with depraved commercials (especially those commercials that depict greed, drugs, new car decadence, and people being hurt)...almost nothing positive in the news, ever. Most AQMS folks probably never heard of and never tuned to the commercial-free Arts channel. However, the Arts provide some hope for Homo Sapiens, even though we may yet kill the planet Earth.    Even if everyone on the Earth knew about the overwhelming genetic evidence (The Journey of Man, by Spencer Wells) that makes every person on the Earth (without exception) a child of the Bushmen of Africa, the world today would probably be the same and nothing would change. Denial is incurable, unbeatable, and an unstoppable plague on our planet.     Denial is about \\"No input, Stephanie...Number 5 is alive\\" and making it all up as he/she goes, \\"Short Circuit\\" or not: from ridiculous royalty delusions of Kings/Queens, back to Hitler's despicable Arian race, to Religions that murder people, and on and on, without end. It is just smoke and mirrors, devoid of reality, and founded upon \\"What's in it for me,\\" but more precisely \\"It's mine all mine!\\" Denial is the mother of all that is wrong with the human race.       Compared to the book, I found Antoine Fuqua's version more satisfying.  Swagger being pulled down the river by a barge was a lot more believable than the book's Swagger holding onto a log for 18 hours, with two bullet wounds. It is a more believable for the sniper action on the Glacier and in its ending when Bob Lee Swagger (not his lawyer) demonstrated why the gun would not shoot. The icing on the cake was when Swagger fired his last shot into the most corrupt and well deserving Senator's head. What followed was even more explosive.     Point of Impact Book:     Stephen Hunter illuminates the world before 9/11 (El Salvador was of interest, the 1993 copyright is just after the first Gulf war) where he guns genocide and greed into political satire, which is very good but not as satisfying as the movie's one-liners, which underscore greed, corruption, as well as many other negative physiological traits of us humans.     There is not much I can say about the book that can top several hundred other reviewers. However, I wished that the book had been twice as long. It was a terrific read. Hunter \\"the psychology nailer\\" knows political infighting of Government agencies.   Hunter's character building of Bob Lee Swagger was superb, starting with cutting off Tim's antlers the day before deer season to letting Dr. Dobbler cop out at the end.     For me, the book was a physiological thriller that was absolutely on target. Stephen Hunter's grasp on how the mind works was well orchestrated by the evil psychiatrist, Dr. Dobbler. Hunter's technical prose on weapons was no less impressive than Clancy at his best (I read most of Clancy's books). Hunter's prose matched the five senses Dean Koontz can conjure up, including the sixth sense (I read most of Koontz's books).     However, the book's version about Swagger's woman being an actual nurse and not a third grade teacher (where is a teacher going to get antibiotics or surgical skills for deep wounds?) made significantly more sense. The movie left out the need for antibiotics, the book was right on target for gangrene candidate wounds.     The book's version about Swagger's hilltop battle was good, but not as totally satisfying as the Movie's shootout with 24 child killers that got their just dues from Swagger and Nick. The book did not have a nasty [...] inside the VA cabin commit suicide, a child and woman killer that deserved to die. This shooter's suicide stayed within his evil character, denying Swagger the satisfaction of killing him. And even rubbing it in with \\"They've got your woman...Bang!\\"     The movie changed Colonel Shreck's name to Colonel Isaac Johnson. The title of the movie \\"Shrek\\" kept popping up in my mind every time I read the Colonel's name in the book. I was glad that the movie changed it to Johnson.    Unlike the movie (probably no sequel is planned), the Bob Lee Swagger books are a trilogy. Thank you, Stephen Hunter, I've got two more Swagger books to savor, \\"Time to Hunt\\" and \\"Black Light!\\" And after I'm done with these, there are books about Bob Lee Swagger's father, plus other great books by Stephen Hunter.

B00006AW2M|5.0|i'm really a Bowie/Donovan/Dylan/Floyd/Simon and Garfunkel/U2/Velvet Underground/Yes fan, but TSMR easily falls into my Prog/Folk Rock collection.    the album has a very unique history that many reviewers have already expressed, so i'll just go into what i liked about the album:    - my Phillips DVD/CD player does better with the DSD format than it did with  the SACD, so i'm very happy about that,      - it easily puts me in the mood to meditate and reflect, sometimes relax to, but i mainly bought it to write along with,    - \\"Gomper\\" has a strong Indian musical influence combined with... i'm not sure, but it plays a lot funkier and less pop-structured than The Beatles' \\"Tomorrow Never Comes\\",        - most importantly, these songs don't usually turn up on Best Of's and Stones compilation albums, so this one is a must-have if you like any songs on the tracklist,    - the snoring at the end of \\"In Another Land\\" reminds me of \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\" on Pink Floyd's \\"Atom Heart Mother\\", recorded three years later,    - in fact, 2000 Light Years From Home also reminds me of longer, but similar efforts on the entire \\"A Saucerful Of Secrets\\" also by Floyd,     - most importantly, these songs don't usually turn up on Best Of's and Stones compilation albums, so this one is a must-have if you like any songs on the tracklist.    5/5
B000PKG7I4|5.0|The first time I saw Amy Winehouse was in the \\"You Know I'm No Good\\" video from her \\"Back to Black\\" CD on VH1. I was stopped in my tracks by the sheer cleverness of the music and the soul deep passion in her voice. So when I found out that Back to Black wasn't her first CD I was ecstatic. I was excited to see the beginnings of this fascinating woman.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed. I was blown away.<br /><br />I thought the use of an updated fifties girl group sound in Back to Black was brilliant.  But Frank was something altogether different. There were sounds and rhythms I hadn't ever heard before, some sounds, fast and slow, that I had heard, but done up in new and surprising ways. She wrote most of the material for the album about a failed relationship and you find clear examples of what this guy was like. \\"Stronger Than Me,\\" is one of the smartest songs I've ever heard. It's a straight forward slap across his face because he just wasn't man enough for her. She takes the theme of her dissatisfaction even further in \\"I Heard Love Is Blind,\\" her attempt to explain away an affair, but then she chastises her shortcomings later on when she asks herself, \\"What is it About Men.\\"<br /><br />Winehouse has all sorts of personal problems and it distresses me to no end that she, as an artist, seems to require her own self-destruction in order to be brilliant. I pray she finds her way back to the studio and to her muse, because she is a uniquely stunning singer and astonishing writer, who unfortunately is on the fast track to being a tragedy.
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|I have not seen the complete movie.  I cannot watch it without  large doses of Dramamine and someone to explain what's happening. Very confusing.
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|I notice that the raving Amazon editorial review starts off by saying Cloverfield doesn't play by the usual rules. Well, it doesn't play by it's own rules, either. The film is totally reliant on a gimmick that it doesn't even use properly. Supposedly the \\"cam corder view\\" is an attempt at hyperrealism, but all it succeded in doing for me was take me out of the moment time and again. There is nothing at all \\"realistic\\" about a hand held camera that always catches every important event and facial expression and that never gets dropped even when its operator is running through wreckage, dodging monsters and leaping from building to building.   This movie was no better than any number of Made For Sci-Fi Channel TV movies I've seen.
B000FZETIO|4.0|I didn't see \\"Pretty and Pink\\" in the 1980s, but the film's enduring popularity motivated me to take a look 22 years hence. \\"Pretty in Pink\\"  is part of John Hughes' oeuvre of '80s teen flicks, even though Hughes did not direct the film. Hughes wrote and produced; Howard Deutch makes his feature film debut directing. As was common with John Hughes films, the plot is simple and silly. The substance is supposed to be in the behavior. Unlike his other films, I think that Hughes achieved more with casting in \\"Pretty and Pink\\" than with dialogue or behavior, which accounts for its staying power. The film is a showcase of early work for a lot of big names.<br /><br />The plot is lifted straight out of Cinderella. Andie (Molly Ringwald) is a barely working class high school senior with a terminally unemployed father (Harry Dean Stanton). She's responsible, ambitious, and doesn't let poverty stand between herself and a trendy wardrobe. She sews her own over-the-top '80s fashions. Andie's greatest wish is that dreamy rich boy Blane (Andrew McCarthy) will invite her to the prom, but the only rich boy who has paid her attention so far is Blane's rakish friend Steff (James Spader). Andie's eccentric friend since childhood, Duckie (Jon Cryer), pines after her, but seems destined to friend status.<br /><br />\\"Pretty and Pink\\" doesn't resonate the way that many of John Hughes' teen movies did. I grew up poor and attended a rich high school, like Andie, but the way the characters interact in this movie doesn't ring true to me. It's a fairy tale. It's not a situation that people can relate to. The film's strength is its cast. Individually, the characters are appealing and interesting: Blane, the nice, handsome preppy. Steff, the licentious, handsome jerk. Annie Potts has a great role as Iona, Andie's colorful friend and employer. If the audience sympathizes with anyone, it is probably with Duckie, played to the hilt by Jon Cryer.<br /><br />Molly Ringwald was well-suited to most of her teen roles, but I'm not enthusiastic about her in this part. Ironically, the film was written for Ringwald, but somehow I just do not buy it. Andie seems contrived, and her emotions fall flat for me. It's also disappointing to see teens played by older actors. Molly Ringwald was the only real teenager. James Spader must have been about 25. But this is a memorable cast, nonetheless. Andrew Dice Clay has a cameo, and you can catch Gina Gershon, Dweezil Zappa, and Kristy Swanson in non-speaking roles. Cinematography is by the talented Tak Fujimoto. \\"Pretty in Pink\\" is fun, but you'll be thinking about the iconic characters and ignoring everything else.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2006): The \\"Everything's Duckie Edition\\" is loaded with 8 featurettes, a Photo Gallery, and a feature commentary. Most of the featurettes include \\"then and now\\" interviews, taking footage from interviews with cast and crew in 1985 and in 2006. John Hughes is the only one not featured in any contemporary interviews. \\"The First Time: The Making of Pretty in Pink\\" (13 min) interviews director Howard Deutch, John Hughes, producer Lauren Shuler, and the cast about making the movie, the music, novice directorial mistakes, and the photography. \\"Zoids and Richies\\" (19 min) interviews cast and crew about characters and includes interesting stuff about casting.  \\"Prom Queen: All About Molly\\" (13 min) interviews Molly Ringwald et al about the character of Andie, her situation, her crush, etc.<br /><br />\\"Volcanic Ensembles\\" (9 min) interviews costume designer Marilyn Vance and actors about the wardrobes.

B000174LVQ|3.0|great music unfortunatly way too much singing.i buy these albums for the guitar playing not the singing.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|Madonna's album released in the year she turns 50 well summarizes the music of today - almost everything has already been here and it is practically impossible to come up with something chart-breaking and groundbreaking at the same time. In the past, Madonna came close to defining her eras with albums like True Blue, Bedtime Stories and her last truly great effort Music. \\"Hard Candy\\" is certainly a danceable pop album dressed in the club-friendly production. However, for all its seduction tries, it is rather uneven, with too large parts sounding rather robotic and mechanical. Lyrics are less personal than on Music or American Life, music is modern alright but mostly not in a striking way.    Track for track:    \\"Candy Shop\\" (Pharrell Williams collabo) starts fresh and offers some of the album's best beats and synth motives. It prepares the way for arguably the best track, the cleverly chosen lead single \\"4 Minutes\\" (copenned by Timbaland/Timberlake/Danja). In fact, the song comes from a similar cupboard as Britney duet Me Against the Music (2003), but is immensely helped by Timba's production and JT's vocals.  Track 3 \\"Give It To Me\\" is one of those mechanical tracks with strong bass line as if hailing from the 1990's dancefloor era, but it's fun enough. \\"Heartbeat\\" has a better hook and overall is a stronger song with better production, which makes it one of the very best tracks on the album.  \\"Miles Away\\" would fit well alongside American Life's Love Profusion or Hollywood - a decent tune with introspective lyrics and some good singing. The same applies to \\"She's Not Me\\", a jealousy anthem with an interesting mid-track tempo change within a rather ordinary Madonna fare.  Track 7 \\"Incredible\\" offers surprising beats but overall misses the mark a little. \\"Beat Goes On\\" - literally, on track 8 ft Kanye West, but the tune is just an average, with only a bridge lending something like a distant melody to it. For dancing it passes very nicely, though.  \\"Dance 2Night\\" isa grower courtesy of Timba/JT/Lane, influenced by disco era of Michael Jackson's Off the Wall album. It's followed by \\"Spanish Lesson\\", a rather lame language course song with a decent sound, but overall nothing special to it, probably the weakest tune of the collection.  The final two tracks end the album on a higher level than the average. \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" is a typical Justin-styled classy ballad that he and Timba (& Co.) know very well how to put up. Closer track 12 \\"Voices\\" (courtesy of them again) offers just about everything necessary to make a good pop song, including a nice touch of strings.    All in all, Madonna finished first 25 years of her career with an album that will probably not be remembered as a masterpiece, but still as a worthy part of her discography. It's not a genius, but a countable addition to our pop culture. It will be interesting to see where she would go from here.
B000W07EKW|5.0|This is \\"the\\" most exciting Trilogy in the history of movies. The heart-pounding, adrenaline rush is consistent through all three. I've seen all three in theaters and found that venue to be the most enjoyable way to see these movies. I own the first two on DVD and still, if I come across it on cable, I can't help, but stop and watch.<br />Now that Blu-Ray has won the HD war for DVD formats, I'm hoping Universal will re-release these in a Blu-Ray set. That will be the closest to the theater experience you can get; the great musical score, heart-pounding action and subtle dialogue.

0887307280|5.0|After the first read of Michael Gerber's \\"The E-Myth Revisited\\" I could hardly put it down.  I will say right from the start that YES ITS SIMPLIFIED, NO ITS NOT THAT EASY, but thats exactly what makes this a great book.  I read the critics' reviews and they seem to be basing their entire opinion of this man's teachings off of one book.  If it were physically possible to fit enough information in one paperback book  to run a business, then running a business would not be difficult at all.     But no, this is not a how-to manual or a solve-all method, this is the beginning of a process.  Gerber introduces us to the three personalities of a entrepreneur (technician, manager, and entrepreneur or visionary) and discusses how most small businesses face a similar problem and that is letting the technician take over the business and killing off the other two.      He discusses how the greatest one-time small businesses in the world have overcome that obstacle.  He does this mainly through praising the franchise system.  In this way I consider this book also on economics- explaining a little bit how small businesses' affect world economy.     The franchise system allows all personalities to excel, and when they excel the customer is better served and better satisfied.  The system works.  So managers and technicians can have a business that will be successful and they will be fulfilled working on.  But it does not stop there.  He also teaches that entrepreneurs must create their small businesses according to a \\"franchise prototype,\\" basically set-up systems and operations so the business can work most effectively (like as if they were to sell it, even if they don't plan to).    When you set-up you business as something you could sell if you wanted to, then you are creating a business of value.  When you do that, then you can be most successful and fulfilled.  What is the point in going into business if after 5 years you've only created more work for yourself and nothing to show for it?    In the book's simple story-telling format, Gerber travels with his protege (and the reader) and walks her through the mindset.   In order to go from unsuccessful to wildly successful- your mindset has to be the first thing to change.  (Read the \\"one star\\" reviews to see the effects of a closed mind).    This book reminds me of the simplicity of \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" and its philosophical take on business.  No, its not a well-laid out instruction manual, thats your job to create a manual.  This book will inspire you to do more than you have previously thought possible.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|This album is very beat heavy and has good hooks to groove to.  If you keep a fresh, open mind, this cd may become your favorite M project.

0156027321|1.0|While it is usually considered proper to review a novel based upon its literary merits, the much boasted purpose by some authors for penning their ideas into existence are so obnoxious that it becomes obligatory to focally lambaste the message, as opposed to the presentation of it.<br /><br />This is certainly the case for Yann Martel’s ‘Life of Pi’, an attempt at moralising so bad as to render the meaning of ‘sententious’ redundant.<br /><br />  Growing up in a secular Indian environment, young Pi begins to take a serious interest in religion; so serious that he claims to be a practicing Hindu, Christian and Muslim.  The first section of the story revolves around his strange creedal concoction, and his attempts to avoid rationalising any aspect of it.  The second section is where the ‘action’ begins.  Through an unfortunate calamity, young Pi ends up stranded on a life boat with a Royal Bengal Tiger.  I would give credit to Martel for a fairly interesting, and often rather fantastical, account of this voyage, if it hadn’t likely been ‘borrowed’ from Moacyr Scliar’s ‘Max and the Cats’.  The final section deals with Pi’s rescue, and his questioning by Japanese Investigators regarding the previous events.  At this point, we are we told to accept that everything we have just had shoddily narrated to us as a fabrication.  Rather, Pi spend a gruesome few weeks on a boat with deranged fellow shipmates.  But we are expected to concur with one of Pi’s questionaires who claims the animal story to have been ‘better’.  In a complete misuse of the genius of Pascal, we are invited to either accept the tiger story, or the likely reality.  His inquisitors decide to accept the pleasing tiger story, and Pi declares that a belief in God is the same.<br /><br />  Thus, from a sweeping introduction which promised to deliver belief in God, we are informed that while God doesn’t exist, it is far sweeter to believe he does.  Sorry Mr. Martel, but I prefer to seek the truth, regardless of the feelings it may generate.  If Mr. Martel is not attempting to advocate ostrich-atheism, then his premises are based on the nursery-rhyme philosophy that is postmodernism: We can all make up our own truth, and it will be true for us.  At times, good literature should be condescending, but never patronising.  The latter seems to be quite a skill by Mr. Martel, as also exhibted by the good folk who patronised his silly nonsense with ‘The Man Booker Prize’ in 2006.  Of course, following the lessons expounded in ‘Life of Pi’, I can ignore that unpleasantless, preferring to believe the prize went to a deserving novel.<br /><br />  In terms of Martel’s story-telling, his characterisation is hollow and about as developed as Java man.  Martel may wish us to perceive his embodiment of youthful zeal as original or in some way inspiring, but all I beheld was a philosophically blinkered, and theologically ignorant, clich&eacute; of religious adherents, grossly perverted and equipped with a multitude of platitudes, while clumsily and unforgivably surviving to an overdue conclusion.  One really wonders if the protagonist is necessary to Martel’s plagiarised plot… …<br /><br />  In spite of what one may think, I do recommend reading ‘Life of Pi’.  It does depict the supposed values that are seen in contemporary religious belief, as well as personify the ideals of postmodernism.  But expect to finish with the nauseating feeling that can only be generated from the indecency of enduring a lecture from a bonafide anti-intellectual.the feelings it may generate.

B000WMFZMY|5.0|EL CID takes its place among the great screen epics that never allow the eye-popping spectacle to dwarf the human characters--just as \\"Ben-Hur\\" was able to do. And who else to play the legendary and noble Spanish hero than CHARLTON HESTON. He's magnificent here, playing his central role with an almost Shakespearean grandeur, as do some of the other cast members, including HERBERT LOM, JOHN FRASER and GARY RAYMOND.<br /><br />So is the epic sweep of the tale and the intimate love story that begins when he is on his way to wed SOPHIA LOREN and finds himself asked to assume the mantle of leadership against the Moors in 11th century Spain. He makes the journey from peace-broker accused of treason to the King's fighting champion and later from exiled hero to legendary martyr.<br /><br />Aside from the brilliant cinematography, authentic looking locales and colorful costumes, Miklos Rozsa's score adds a great deal to the intensely dramatic intimate scenes as well as the epic battles, all the while suggesting some Spanish motifs amidst the heraldic fanfares and love theme.<br /><br />CHARLTON HESTON makes an impressive figure of El Cid, especially good in the final moments as the wounded leader who knows what he must ask his wife to do so that his followers do not lose heart after his death. RAF VALLONE as Count Ordonez, GENEVIEVE PAGE as Princess Urraca, JOHN FRASER as Prince Alfonso and GARY RAYMOND as Prince Sancho are all remarkable effective in strong supporting roles. In lesser roles, HURD HATFIELD and FRANK THRING bring their own brand of authority to minor parts.<br /><br />Anthony Mann and his assistant directors have done an outstanding job on all of the battle scenes and he never falters in telling the tale in strong dramatic terms. There's an intensity in the scenes between Loren and Heston after he has been forced to kill her father for humiliating his own father in front of the court. Whatever friction there was between Heston and Loren on the set, works for them here because her animosity toward him is a chilling thing to watch.<br /><br />The DVD has been wonderfully mastered and all of the Miklos Rozsa score sounds better than ever with Overture, Intermission and Exit music reminding us all what a treasure he was as a film composer.toward him is a chilling thing to watch.

B0016HNOXQ|4.0|Listened to the CD a few times, and the parts and pieces are starting to take shape. This is not an easy listen the first time, the themes and moods are somewhat elusive, and hard to pin down, not unlike a living, breathing thing.    Gone are the electric guitars, jazzy horns, and warm trip-hop beats. In its place is a more stripped down, sparse and repelling vibe going on here. The mood is a bit of an uncomfortable fear. Sort of the anti-Norah Jones.    With this release, Portishead has drifted even further from the mainstream, as evidenced by the wide-range of reviews on this site. As such, they seem to have left their more faddish, intolerable fans in the dust - those who came to like the band based on their dance club, coffeehouse stylings from the mid-nineties. Make no mistake - Portishead did not create this album to broaden thier fan base, but to weed it out.    Standout tracks:    Silence   Hunter   Plastic  We Carry on   Small

0141439610|5.0|For sheer mystery and excitement,\\" The Woman in White \\", was unmatched in the genre of 19th century literature. That is what one must keep in mind when reading this extraordinary novel. Written in 1860, nothing approaching it had ever been attempted, and if the New York Times best seller list had been in existence at the time, it would have topped the list for countless numbers of weeks. Like many authors of the period, the book was serialized, and it was followed voraciously by tens of thousands of readers. It continued to remain popular when published in book form. For those who relish an intricate plot, serendipitous chance coincidences filled with its share of villains, heroes, and fragile heroines in distress, along with a modicum of amateur detective work, then this is the novel that will entertain and satisfy those who are avid readers of the likes of Dickens, Conan Doyle, and Thackeray.
0440418569|3.0|I came late to this trilogy, only reading the books after the movie came out (I did not see the movie).  I was intrigued by some of the controversy and picked up the books - when I saw they had won numerous awards I figured I was in for a treat. There are some interesting ideas and characters, but overall I was disappointed.  Except for Lyra and Will, most characters seem to be invented to meet a specific plot need and then are discarded.  And I'm left with no understanding of what drives the characters. Why is Asriel mounting a rebellion? Why does Coulter change (other than some quick explanation about realizing she loved her daughter).  With as many characters as he crams in here (witches, bears, avaiators, John Perry, the veritcally challenged warriors, the angels, Mary Malone, the malufa (sp?)), I was hoping for some connective thread.  Too many times I was left with the feeling of \\"that's it?\\"  I wasn't expecting perfection, with all of the story lines neatly tied up, but this is kind of a mess.  I gave 3 stars for the whole series since it kept me intrigued enough to keep going.
0440242576|2.0|I've read two very different books by John Grisham and I have to say, I don't get his appeal. Skipping Christmas has a decent premise: fed up with the expense and consumerism of Christmas, a couple decides to skip the celebrations and instead go on a Caribbean cruise. The news doesn't sit well with the neighbors, who for some reason feel they have a say in their decision.<br /><br />As  I said, the idea is not bad, but the writing is so mediocre (and in occasions, worse than mediocre) that the novel never engages the reader. The end is better than the rest of the book, and it manages to be moving, but even though this novel is only 277 pages, it feels very, very long.

Though when I became an adult I had to see this movie and thought it was excelent.  THe acting and casting in this movie was spot on.  This is one of the best movies of all time in my mind.
0452287588|5.0|It made me understand why a lot of the stuff that we do as human beings gets done.  I makes sense that much of what damages us is that we believe our opinion of ourselves is who we are, but Eckhart Tolle makes it clear that we run much deeper than that. If you want some answers, this book will help you to see inside and while they might not all be answered, it is a good starting point and eventually you will get there :)
0783229526|1.0|I heard many people rave about this movie and then I watched it for myself and nothing ever happened really in the movie to me.  It just seemed like 2 hours that lead nowhere.  I'll watch anything once all the way through.  Will never watch this bad movie again though.

B000TSIK14|5.0|take the 'sound' of Savage Amusement and Crazy World - the musical tightness, if that is what I mean, how it was more like music and not just head bangin screaming guitars with mindless repetitions...   then add intelligent lyrics...   Throw in that awesome, classic, Schenker/Jabs can't-help-but-do-your-air-guitar-impersonation lead guitar... then figure in how Klaus' english has improved to perfection and that there (I think) are others doing background vocals instead of just him... this is it.   smooth, tight, musical... intelligent.  Mature heavy metal.  lol.

B00102F5WK|2.0|Saw a billboard for this movie in Chicago.  I thought it would be good just from the cast, but I was wrong.  I bought it, but the movie is boring, changes story lines, and the viewer doesn't really care what happens to characters in the end.  I recommend renting this instead of buying it.
B000YAA68C|1.0|If you've read the book... save yourself the time and frustration. This is hardly the same story, and whats left of Cecelia Ahern's book isn't worth bothering with.    It isn't set in Ireland, it's set in NYC. Holly is American and Gerry is Irish. The letters are mushed together, drawn out and important details lost. Holly hardly seems to be the grieving widow as told in the book. She seems happy, upbeat and well healed. *spoiler* SHE HAS A ONE NIGHT STAND! This doesn't happen in the book. She has issues getting close to Daniel in the book, who, in the movie is a bumbling idiot with social issues. They don't take a trip to a Spanish Island, but instead, go to Ireland. His parents are wonderful and accepting and her mother in the movie (who is now a single mother... wtf) is a judgemental bitch.     Thats just the tip of the iceberg... this movie is a waste of time and does a HUGE injustice to the original book. What was Hollywood thinking? Save your time and money and if, like me, you are curious enough to suffer through it, just Google Video search it.

B000Y7U98C|3.0|This is a survivalist story set in space, which just so happens to have a quiet fate-of-the-earth-depends-on-you as its primary drive behind all the scenes.<br /><br />The Pro's: This is a movie to watch when in a somber sci-fi mood, but wanting a little dramatic eye candy. There is no fat in the story despite the slow pace, starting strongly with a prologue to drop the viewer immediately into the storyline. The characters seem initially standard, but quickly move to a more thoughtful friction between survivalist tactics versus human ethics. The actors are excellent throughout. You've seen it all before in other movies, but not nearly so subtly presented. Maybe too subtle....<br /><br />The Con's: See all the other reviews - It is a little too slow paced. The insane Captain of the first ship is annoying to watch and unbelieveable in every way; his role ruins what could have been a great plot in some other form. I still can't figure out 1.) How he survived 7 yrs on a ship behind Mercury when the flight controls were busted 2.) No one smelled him coming since it was clear he hadn't taken a shower in a while 3.) How he survived being burned/heavily irradiated, stabbed...only to have his skin ripped off toward the end. And what was with all the dust on the Icarus I in the first place - manna from heaven? A burned flight crew couldn't have made all that.<br /><br />All right, I think I've ranted enough. In summary, this is a rental film, not a buy, good for a night when you want to fold laundry or review papers with something on in the background.
0385504209|4.0|This book is off to the races from the beginning to end, leaving the reader wanting more after each page as there's mystery, murder, good and bad, as well as lots of historical knowledge. However there are also various perspectives of the authors interpretation of organized religious and anti religious groups which makes the book even more readable but no believable.  However, if you really want to read a hollywood movie style book, read his first book Angels and Demons which is even more off the wall.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|[[ASIN:B0013D8LOU Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)]]    If you love Johnny Depp, you will love this movie.

B00004KD1L|3.0|You either like or don't like Groove Armada and they are a good listen with some really good tracks, however many listeners who are not used to progressive house and such will find it repetitive and drole. I find this a good rhythmic album and has some nice nuances that are typical of Groove Armada.
B000Y179KO|4.0|Let me say something flat out, and hope and pray that everyone understands what I'm driving at: the Eagles were--and are--a great singles band.  Taken song-by-song, their discography is the best in the business.  If you look at albums as a whole, however, there's something lacking.  Not to say it isn't good--far, far better than most bands--but there's just something not there.<br /><br />I think LONG ROAD OUT OF EDEN is a perfect example of that.  After all, it gives us two full-length discs to work with.  The simple fact is, there's a lot of filler here.  Good filler, yes--but filler nonetheless.  I've listened to this album several times now (I bought it the day it was released; why I'm only reviewing it now, months later, I have no idea), and a lot of the songs haven't stuck with me.  It's like they were put on there in order to make this a two-disc set.<br /><br />Now, as we all know, the Eagles, at their absolute worst, are still better than pretty much everybody else in the business--so maybe this is all a moot point.  I'll go ahead and mention a few highlights, though of course you'll have to judge yourself: the harmonic \\"No More Walks in the Woods;\\" the country rockers \\"How Long\\" and \\"Buy Being Fabulous;\\" the scathing \\"Fast Company,\\" \\"Business as Usual,\\" and \\"Frail Grasp on the Big Picture;\\" the whistfully beautiful \\"I Love to Watch a Woman Dance;\\" the eloquent instrumental \\"I Dreamed There Was No War;\\" the peaceful \\"No More Cloudy Days\\" and \\"Do Something;\\" and of course the title track, a politically-charged \\"Hotel California.\\"<br /><br />Politics abound on this album (I've always said, Don Henley is at his best when he's pissed at the government, which he pretty much has been since the eighties).  But don't let it get ya down--it's politics set to good music.  And at least it's SMART politics--no \\"get this guy outta office 'cause he sucks\\" junk, but real music for real people with real problems.  'Course, it's not all serious--\\"Guilty of the Crime\\" is fun, fun fun.  So, you see, there's something for everybody on LONG ROAD OUT OF EDEN.  And the fact that the Eagles can sell more records today than they could in the seventies suggests something very, very important: that good music ages like good wine (or, since we're dealing with rock 'n roll, good women).  The Eagles are still the best at what they do.  There's simply no room for argument., there's something for everybody on LONG ROAD OUT OF EDEN.

B0015D3Z4O|4.0|Madonna has always been one to be \\"up on the times\\".  While 2005's CONFESSIONS ON A DANCE FLOOR was a solid, highly rated album, purists found it to be the first \\"back-step\\" Madonna has made.  What is meant by \\"back step\\" isn't quality, but rather Madonna for the first time failed to bring something new to the table.  In that regard, anyone who knows Madonna knew that a hip-hop driven album was sure to follow up the dance/club driven CONFESSIONS.  While HARD CANDY is certainly not \\"the second coming\\" by any means, it does return Madonna on the track of bringing something new to the table, even if HARD CANDY could've been performed by a slew of other artists (Gwen Stefani or Nelly Furtado just to name a few).  Either way, it is surely more apt to keep Madonna in the forefront of rock/pop music as opposed if she had released CONFESSIONS ON A DANCE FLOOR 2.  Sure \\"Hung Up\\" made it to #7 on the pop charts, but \\"4 Minutes\\" featuring pop darling Justin Timberlake ascended quickly to #3.  HARD CANDY is certainly more commercial for American than CONFESSIONS, which felt much more European than American where dance/club flourishes more.<br /><br />The album starts with a Neptunes helmed production, \\"Candy Shop\\", perhaps the strongest Neptune production I've heard in sometime (not dissing them).  Madonna sounds fantastic here and \\"Candy Shop\\" is both sexy and erotic at the same time, without crossing the line, as Madge has done numerous times in the past.  Let's face it, she's the Prince (Rogers Nelson) of pop, really. Sure there's plenty of innuendo when Madge sings \\"sticky and sweet\\" and talks about \\"Turkish Delight\\" but at least it goes no further than that.  Timbaland producer first single \\"4 Minutes\\" is another exception selection from HARD CANDY. Here Madonna blends quite well with Timberlake, who is nearly half her age.  Evidently, \\"age really ain't nothin' but a number\\" as Madge sounds a strongly as she did when she was singing \\"Like A Virgin\\" in the 80s.  And honestly, do we really care if the track is about 4:04 as opposed to 4:00 (Did you guys even notice that?).<br /><br />\\"Give It 2 Me\\" keeps up the sexualized energy of HARD CANDY and is a great choice for a second single.  Sure, it doesn't sparkle as much as the first two selections, but it definitely screams \\"commercial\\".  \\"Heartbeat\\", another Neptunes production, is another hit. Why there are no more references to \\"sticky and sweet\\", there are enough \\"hot and bothered\\" sound effects from Pharrell Williams to make up for the gap.  \\"Miles Aways\\" tames Madonna's inner tiger a bit, and is a welcomed break.  Sure, it isn't as hard-edged as \\"Candy Shop\\" or \\"Give It 2 Me\\", but it is certainly a standout by all means.<br /><br />\\"She's Not Me\\" is certainly catchy, though it is too lengthy running a little more than six minutes in duration.  Despite the length, it is solid by all means.  \\"Incredible\\" is well produced, though it is also a bit lengthy as well.  Madonna sounds great though, which is the key.  \\"Beat Goes On\\" featuring Kanye West revives any lost steam and proves to be the third production standout from The Neptunes.  Pharrell Williams falsetto here sounds among the best it ever has and Madge is definitely on her game.  Kanye West is good as well, but Madge is the queen here.  \\"Dance 2night\\" featuring Justin Timberlake is good, though it doesn't dare eclipse \\"4 Minutes\\" by any means.  \\"Spanish Lesson\\" is OK, but forgettable compared against the rest of HARD CANDY.  It is a miss, though the Spanish guitar-laced production is cool as well as the hip-hop beat, ala The Neptunes.  The album ends on a high note with the standout \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognized You\\".<br /><br />Sure, HARD CANDY has it's flawed moments, but it is ultimately a more exciting album than CONFESSIONS by all means.  CONFESSIONS extended dance/club sequences were a bit overwrought for the casual listener and aside from a few extended numbers here, the shorter durations tend to be more potent than the extended ones.  4 stars.

B00132D808|4.0|While those who loved Panic at the Disco's debut may hate PRETTY. ODD.,  I think that PRETTY. ODD. is ten times the album their debut was.  With the exception of a couple of strong tracks (\\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\\" and \\"Lying Is the Most Fun...\\" namely), I wasn't a Panic (formerly Panic!) fan in the least.  Sure, I love their videos, but the band just seemed a bit over the top to me.  Evidently, the boys of Panic at the Disco got the same notion about themselves, canning their original follow-up to their debut with this \\"pretty. odd.\\" sophomore album.  Sure, it is a bit schizophrenic in composition, but somehow, this novelty album ultimately works perfectly.  If anything, it did propel the Panic boys to a chart position they'd never seen before, #2 with a bow of 139,000, not bad for an album that never new what six-digits was until it was eventually certified platinum.  While the chances of PRETTY. ODD. going platinum seem convoluted by its initial slow, lackadaisical sales,  it could go gold. But then, we are in a time where NOTHING is selling.<br /><br />\\"Nine in the Afternoon\\", the first true selection from PRETTY. ODD. is an excellent choice for first single.  It is short and sweet, and the production if phenomenal.  Brendon Urie's vocals seem to be much more mature on PRETTY. ODD. than on their first outing, which is a plus.  Following \\"Nine in the Afternoon\\", a series of strong, standout and varied tracks follow including \\"She's a Handsome Woman\\", the slightly manic and cabaret  \\"Do You Know What I'm Seeing\\" in which Brendon Urie sings the catchiest lyrics of the whole album (\\"I know it's sad, but I never gave a damn about the weather and it never gave a damn about me\\" ), and the irresistible \\"That Green Gentleman (Things Have Changed)\\".  All are solid, more than can be said about their debut, at least in my opinion.<br /><br />Skipping over pointless interludes (I think most interludes are pointless by the way), \\"Northern Downpour\\" features some of the sickest guitar riffs of PRETTY. ODD. while \\"When The Day Met The Night\\" just might be my personal favorite of the entire album.  \\"Pas de Cheval\\" is solid as well, while the remainder of the tracks begin to lose some of their uniqueness and freshness.  Sure \\"The Piano Knows Something That I Don't Know\\", \\"Behind The Sea\\", \\"She Had the World\\", \\"From a Mountain in the Middle of the Cabins\\"  and\\"Mad As Rabbits\\" are all solid, but the aren't as strong as the forefront and middle portions of PRETTY. ODD., which are pretty excellent. However, by the time, nobody really cares because Panic have really established themselves as more credible artists than their debut proved (despite the Grammy nomination).  Overall, PRETTY. ODD. scores highly in my grade book. 4 stars.r riffs of PRETTY.

0471702188|1.0|People buy this book to evaluate companies and make investment decisions, don't they? If that's most of the readers' goal, this book is pretty much useless.    The calculation of net present value (NPV) of companies is purely a concept, which sounds great but impossible to accurately capture quantitatively using a formula.     The difficult is in evaluating stable future cash flow, not on how to calculate the NPV. The evaluation of future cash flow depends on the history of a company, and much more importantly, on the company's business model, the management team, etc. Neither of these are clearly emphasized or discussed in this book. For example, R&D generates future cash flow, but should all R&D be treated equal? More leverage of a wise management is a great thing, but when is leverage good or bad?    If you are into value investing, read Graham's The Intelligent Investor. If you are a pro, read Graham and Dodd's Security Analysis 10 times. Fisher's Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits, albeit old, is also a much more useful reading than this one.

B000YAA68C|5.0|Wow!  What a great movie, much to my surprise.  I went for only 2 reasons.  The #1 reason - Gerard Butler who's GORGEOUS & unbelievably talented.  The #2 reason - Hilary Swank (2 time Academy Award Winner), who's good in everything.  I figured that if they \\"signed on\\" then it's got to be a good show.  It was.  I was apprehensive at first in regard to the plot, a dead guy who wrote letters to be sent to his widow after he dies.  I thought it would be lame.  It is such a great show.  Hilary is such a good actress, right away I felt like I was in her shoes, she made you feel like YOU were the widow experiencing the denial, anger, etc.  Gerard no doubt scored major \\"chick points\\" with his charming performance.  However I don't think he really even had to try too hard as he's very talented.  He got to use his natural accent and real first name for his character.  The \\"Gerry\\" in the movie wasn't too much of a stretch for Gerard as in real life he seems to be a very unique, energetic/lively, fun-loving guy.  Oh and the bonus was his smile & those eyes.  They will melt you every time.  I doubt there was any woman that didn't completely fall in love with him during his few appearances in the movie.  It was all very believable, nothing was far-fetched.  Thank you Hilary & Gerard for such an emotionally-charged movie; denial, anger, love, comedy, etc.  Absolutely worth watching again & again.  The music is great also.  All I know is that I left the theater crying and thought seriously about life being too short & to make the most of the time we do have!  Love you Gerard!

0143038419|3.0|This book demonstates the power of Oprah.  It is written, at best, mediocre.  The story is good, but it is told in such an egotistical voice, particularly the first third of the book, that I nearly put it down before I got to India.  I'm glad I waded through the garbage to get to her experiences in the Ashram in India.  I found this part truly inspiring, despite the cheesiness of her humor.      The book is a huge hit, no doubt, thanks to Oprah's wing.  It just seems like it was rushed off the press.  It could have used a lot of editing, and for a \\"spiritual\\" book, it was painfully egoic.  I gave my copy away.  Not a keeper.

B00005NC66|5.0|\\"A Bout de Souffler,\\" (\\"Breathless\\")1960, a French crime drama/romance/thriller was the first of the \\"Nouvelle Vogue\\"(\\"New Wave\\") films - made by a school of filmmakers associated with the noted French cinema  enthusiasts' magazine \\"Cahiers du Cinema--\\" principally Jean Luc Godard, and Francois Truffaut, among others.  Truffaut wrote the script; Godard directed; it was his first film.  It starred the \\"jolie-laid,\\" (beautiful-ugly) Jean-Paul Belmondo, making his film debut as Michel Poiccard/Laszlo Kovacs, a petty thief-cop killer.  And the stunningly beautiful Jean Seberg, then 21, as Patricia Franchini, a seemingly aimless American girl taking classes at Paris's famed university, the Sorbonne, selling The New York Herald Tribune International Edition along the City's equally famed shopping street, the Champs Elysee.  It introduced techniques that were to become commonplace: hand-held cameras, jump cuts, a cool jazz soundtrack, as it told its story, filmed on the streets of Paris for less than $50,000: even then a bargain basement price.<br /><br />In plot, actually, it could be a typical B crime thriller of the 1930's or 40's; Poiccard kills the cop in the first few minutes of the film -we're never quite sure why; thereafter, he just wants to raise enough money to flee to Italy with Patricia; who doesn't wish to go, and will eventually take steps to assert her independence.  Poiccard is much more self-aware than an earlier generation of filmic criminals were; he's a great admirer of Humphrey Bogart; constantly trying on the mannerisms of that iconic actor.  It's not easy to sympathize with him; yet we eventually do, to some extent.<br /><br />\\"Breathless\\" is widely considered a great, groundbreaking film, and so it is.  But my relationship with it is a little different than most people: I first saw it upon its initial release, as a college freshman.  Someone once remarked that great books we read when we are young serve as lighthouses: casting their light forward on where we will eventually go.  Well, for me, actually, it was movies rather than books, that illuminated the way forward, and \\"Breathless\\" was surely a lighthouse for me.  Was it the coolness of the characters?  Their ironic, disaffected viewpoints?  For sure, the two leads are portrayed as shallow and vain, yet the movie spoke to something in the young woman I was; wish I could put my finger on it.

B00005JPS7|5.0|A little worried about Iron Man being just another so-so Marvel movie, such as Fantastic Four? Well don't be. Actually you can stop reading my review now if you want and get up and go watch this movie.<br /><br />If you're still here (oh ye of little faith), then I'll try and help you with that tendril of doubt still holding you to your computer chair preventing you to get up and spend the 300 dollars it costs to go see a movie now. 600 if you are taking a date.<br /><br />Let me first start off with Rob Downey. I for one was hesitant with him being the man who is playing Tony Stark (Iron Man). I rolled my eyes the first time I saw his name a year or so ago when I found out about this movie being made. Even when I saw the first pics for it. But let me tell you right now... the man IS Tony Stark. He's got this role down. I haven't seen this good of a Downey movie since `Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' and `Wonder Boys'. At first I thought he was a total jerk at the beginning, but then realized it's just his way of being funny, and it's absolutely fantastic. Through the whole movie Rob will have you laughing quite a bit. He's not only funny, but he's also quite laid back with his genius. He doesn't bash your face in with how smart he is. To show you how smart he is the film shows a bunch of scientists trying to create something that just isn't possible with today's technology. Though Tony Stark was able to do it an Afghan Cave with spare parts from junk.<br /><br />The film is about Tony Stark. The son of Howard Stark, also a genius. Tony inherits the company from his father when his father dies. He's basically partners with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges who also played the part brilliantly). Stark Industries is known for producing military weapons that, according to Tony, needs to be used only once to end a war. Tony soon finds himself captive of an Afghan rebel group that want his weapons made for them, because whoever owns his weapons, basically wins the war. Tony creates the classic Iron Man suit to get out of the captives hands and once he does, Tony decides he doesn't want to create weapons anymore. He wants to create things to help the world, not destroy it. The rest of the owners of Stark Industries isn't to happy with this and they decide to, basically, just not listen to Tony anymore (can't think of the word for this... sorry). While Tony's company is basically doing whatever they want, Tony is in his mansion revamping his original build of his suit. Not to ruin anything about the story (I promise I haven't ruined anything yet, I told you mostly what you can see in the trailers), lets just say Tony is about to put his new suit into some good usage.<br /><br />The special effects were used just right. I honestly didn't think they would be able to make Iron Man look that cool or move that cool. Well let me just say, have no fear, because he rocks. From the classic Iron Man suit to the new. The old Iron Man walks just like you think he should, a bulky machine. The new, well, lets just say you would almost not think he's wearing a suit it's so human like, but just enough machine movement to know it's not completely fake looking. I don't know how to explain it, but it looked great.<br /><br />Also the action scenes were great. I think one of the biggest reasons why they were so good is that they were used sparingly. The movie isn't action packed but has just enough to not tick you off that there wasn't enough and also not to many to over do it. It was just right. Which in turn helps the story out, because it helped give us that character development that a lot of people complain about in these Marvel movies.<br /><br />One last thing I want to say about the actual movie is that Gwyneth Paltrow wasn't bad. I'm someone who really isn't fond of her acting. But she plays Pepper Potts, Tony's `assistant/butler... whatever', and she did a really good job. Paltrow in a supporting role, instead of a lead, is a much better combination, in my opinion.<br /><br />In the end, I think everyone will enjoy this movie. Go take a second loan out so you can pay for gas, movie tickets, and popcorn and coke (maybe some twizzlers if you go donate some blood first) and enjoy a day at the movies! Make sure you stay past the 10 minute credits to see the special ending.<br /><br />P.S. When you see Iron Man fighting, imagine him being 2 or 3 stories tall. Just imagine it. Now picture him with an Autobot or Decepticon emblem on his chest. Now watch him fight. See how cool it is to actually see what the heck is going on during his fight scenes? Maybe in Transformers 2, Bay will be able to put a coherent fight scene together that the viewers can actually tell what is going on instead of watching a bunch of polygons mish mashing together.enjoy this movie.

B0006GANN2|5.0|\\"The French Connection,\\" (1971) opens: we quickly see Brooklyn, New York, a few days before Christmas.  It's brutal: we see a sidewalk Santa shivering at his Salvation Army bucket; a man freezing his touchas off as he works a hot dog cart.  Suddenly we realize they're cops surveilling a dive of a bar, as they tear their costumes off and rush inside.  So begins a nonstop action thriller, one of the greatest crime dramas/police procedurals of the 1970's; one of Hollywood's most celebrated golden eras.<br /><br />In 1971, \\"Connection\\" won five Oscars: Best Picture; Best Actor for Gene Hackman; Best Director for William Friedkin (it now appears this movie will be the crowning achievement of his career). Best Writing for Ernest Tidyman, noted author of Shaft, ([[ASIN:B00004Z1FX Shaft]]) who wrote \\"Connection's\\" witty screenplay (Howard Hawks contributed uncredited polish). (According to Tidyman's niece, Kathryn Tidyman, Ernest, although white, \\"received an award from the NAACP for his depiction of the character of John Shaft, a black detective. Many people who saw the Shaft films presumed he was black­-had to be. He was just a brilliant writer who soaked up everything about the people and culture in the big cities in which he lived during his relatively short life.\\")<br /><br />The film received its final Oscar for Best Editing.  The excellent cinematography was by the talented Owen Roizman.  Add to that the fact that it was based on a crackerjack novel by well-known thriller writer Robin Moore.  And the odd fact that G. David Schine, a New York boy if ever there was one, and a central figure during the 1950's Army-McCarthy hearings, gets a credit as  Executive Producer, and you have one flavorful film.<br /><br />The plot is, of course, pretty well-known; based on a true story of a major 1970's drug bust.  New York was then in big trouble, reeling from drug use, an overburdened welfare system, graffiti, crime, and near bankruptcy.  Hackman plays the always in overdrive New York City Police Detective Jimmy \\"Popeye\\" Doyle; Roy Scheider plays Det. Buddy \\"Cloudy\\" Russo, his partner.  Both stars of the true life drama, Eddie Egan and Sonny Grasso, play minor characters in the film; each advised on the picture, and would go on to successful careers, post Police Department, as advisers to the entertainment trade on police matters.  We see a Bunuel favorite, Fernando Rey as their chief antagonist, smooth Frenchman Alain Charnier; and a Costa-Gravas favorite, Marcel Bozzuffi as Pierre Nicoli, his henchman.  And we get the under appreciated Tony Lo Bianco as Sal Boca, hard luck fall guy.  For an added fillip, we get a couple of scenes of Philadelphia girl group - always loved them-- the Three Degrees.  Plus, of course, we get two of the screen's most memorable sequences: the (elevated) subway/automobile chase, and Nocoli's concluding death on the subway steps.<br /><br />Most of all, we get what was at the time an absolutely fresh, genuine picture of New York as it then was, as real as a blast of Arctic winter air.  We see a lot of its subways; there's even a poster somewhere in a subway car dated \\"1971.\\"  We see the Empire State Building on the horizon a couple of times, and the World Trade Center going up.  Lower East Side landmark restaurant Ratner's; Ward's Island; The Westbury, and other luxury hotels and restaurants: Charnier sends a cup of coffee out to Hackman, shivering as he surveills him.  Brooklyn has never been better served: Doyle is shown as living in a project there.  My neighborhoods, the places I knew best: the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges,the Brooklyn Queens Expressway and its exit ramps, Hicks Street and Court Street,the  Brooklyn Heights Promenade with its heart-stopping views of Manhattan as Xanadu, right there on the screen. The classic chase sequence begins at Bay 50th Street, in Bensonhurst. Hackman had a real-life car crash filming the chase, at Stillwell Avenue and 86th Street; it was left in.  Friedkin, who was only 32 when he won his Oscar for this movie, has said he utilized documentary techniques to get its edginess; he cut that celebrated car chase to Carlos Santana's hit \\"Black Magic Woman.\\"<br /><br />Listen, they just don't make them like this anymore....for this movie, has said he utilized documentary techniques to get its edginess; he cut that celebrated car chase to Carlos Santana's hit \\"Black Magic Woman.\\"     Listen, they just don't make them like this anymore....
B000002WU9|5.0|This album is the best Wu joint to ever be released. Point blank. There is not a song on here that you can really skip thru, IF you are keen on the Wu (RZA) sound. If you are not, then maybe you shouldn't cop a listen. I would not expect the newer generation to appreciate this magnum opus but that is essentially what it is:    1. Heaven and Hell  2. Glaciers of Ice  3. Verbal Intercourse  4. Incarcerated Scarfaces  5. Ice Cream  6. Rainy Dayz  7. Guillotine  8. Wu-Gambinos    That is my list of favorites even though I can put the CD in my CD player and never touch a single button other than to PLAYBACK. In my opinion, this is the number 1 Wu album followed by Liquid Swords AND THEN their first release. It would seem that I am putting the carriage before the horse, but it actually goes to show just how much RZA and the Wu bangers had progressed with each year because after Liquid Swords, the albums just were not the same again (Ironman is the last great album, IMO). In order to appreciate this album, you've probably got to be 26 and older. '94, '95, and '96 were the best years in hip hop and this was the crown jewel of '95 (late '94). The making of a brand.

B00132D808|5.0|The majority of critics of 'Pretty Odd' seem to focus on comparing their previous album to this one. What's truly amazing is the lack of depth of the reviews FOCUSING solely on comparing old to new. I am reading so many mixed reviews of this album but my perception is a lot of negativity regarding this album. As time passes this album will go down as one of the most creative and album from PATD.  It bears repeating - This album is so freaken creative, so out there, so 'odd', such a refreshing sound that listeners need time to understand it. This album actually got me excited about music again. I was tired of the 'pop' sound and what i received in this album is a defining classic that will take most fans time to appreciate.   How much time? DECADES!!!!!

0143143492|5.0|I bought the paperback version a while ago.  However, it is tough for me to follow through the words Eckhart was saying in the book.  So, I left it in my car's trunk until lately.  Then, I bought the CD version.  It is much easier for me to digest what his words are pointed to.    Be very careful about your own communication/learning style, I would say.  If you know you can process information the most through reading, get the book.  If you know it is better for you to process information through attentive listening, then get the CDs.    I listen and re-listen these CDs now.  The messages are beautiful and powerful in helping us be aware of the egoic voice in our head and the pain body.  Chapter 8, 9, 10 helped me realize the deep purpose I have been searching for.  This is a book that words cannot discribe how it helps pointing to a spiritual path to consciousness of being.  I also start seeing how the egoic thinking comes into \\"form\\" in slow motion.  I still am possessed with thoughts at times.  However, at least I am aware that I am not those thoughts in my head (thank goodness).      Webcast from Oprah helps a lot to deepen these messages for me.  I recommend them too.    I want to caution others with one thing though.  Do not try \\"pushing\\" consciousness/the book.  Pointing and guiding is great for those who are suffering.  Pushing because we tell others \\"A New Earth\\" is the best book to awaken ourselves is like, \\"I know what's best for you.  I know I am right.\\" instead of creating that space for others to choose.  Then, you know the ego has returned to you (or myself too ... I am still practicing the catching of these little thoughts every time as they arise still).      NOTE: Not everyone is ready to be awaken from the ego & the pain body.  We human beings need to respect others' journey and their paths.  Maybe just recognize that the ego/pain body in them are not who they truly are.  Guide them through with encouragement and unconditional love.      Let themchoose!      There is no need to identify with a mental position of this book (Buddhism repackaged or \\"Evil\\" book because it's \\"against Christianity\\").  Once we identify with a mental position, we lost the essence of these pointers.  I think we need to be very clear with messages versus messenger.  If you are here to learn more about what these messages with an open mind & heart, this book is great.  If you are here to judge, to find enemy, to justify your opinion is right ... Then, you will find a lot of suffering in yourself.  Then, one might as well put the book aside (give it away) and move on with life.      Thank you for reading my review.  Many blessings and gratitude!

0670018651|4.0|Turin argues in his earlier book, _The Secret of Scent_, that smell is not so much about memory and biology, as is widely believed, as it is about beauty and imagination. He believes, furthermore, that one of the highest achievements in perfumery is what he terms \\"abstraction,\\" that is to say, the creation of olfactory accords that, while perhaps alluding to natural smells, are novel and resistant to definition. These aesthetic axioms (which he presumably shares with co-author/wife Tania Sanchez) are the basis of the evaluations in this book, and we, as readers, have no choice but to take them or leave them. These axioms lead the authors to prefer complex fragrances over simple ones, fragrances that develop over time to linear ones, original and/or unique fragrances over skillful executions of old ideas, \\"interesting\\" (even if vaguely unpleasant) fragrances over boring (even if pleasant) ones, etc. In a nutshell, they apply the same standards to perfume that other critics usually apply to other arts. They want perfumery to be taken seriously as an art form, and say as much.<br /><br />This is a legitimate view, and one to which I am highly sympathetic. That said, I think the authors overlook (or deliberately ignore) some of the factors that render the purely aesthetic appreciation of perfume difficult at best. First of all, perfumes are made to be worn. The final aesthetic effect of a fragrance is inseparable from the time, place, and person(s) involved. Of course this \\"framing\\" or contextualization effect is at work in all art forms, but it is arguably more important for perfumery than for others. Given the fact that perfumes are mixtures of chemicals, factors such as temperature, humidity, skin pH, decomposition, underlying body odor, age-related hyposmia, differing olfactory thresholds, etc., make this state-dependence even more crucial. And, regardless of what Turin might say, it is simply impossible to separate a fragrance from the associations (read: memories)it may evoke. Perhaps it's possible to \\"see\\" the Platonic form of a perfume behind all of these contingencies, but I highly doubt it. Our reactions to smells are visceral before they're intellectual or aesthetic, no doubt because our sense of smell is our primary sentinel against many toxins and pathogens. Individual differences in sensitivity to certain aromatic chemicals are highly significant and render any kind of objective discussion of fragrances impossible. We're not even working with the same equipment--it's like a society of people who are all partially blind to different colors trying to discuss color coordination. The fundamental variability of our olfactory apparatus, even before differences in taste are taken into account, makes the arrogance of some of the pronouncements in this book a bit galling.<br /><br />People *wear* fragrances (as opposed to sniffing them on strips--decidedly a minority pastime) for a variety of reasons: to make a statement, to find comfort or stimulation, to complement a particular ensemble, to seduce (and here the tastes of the quarry count far more than Apollonian meditations on beauty), and even, in some parts of the world, to mask the fact that they haven't bathed (it's no wonder that perfumery reached its pinnacle in Europe, where people didn't--and sometimes still don't--bathe regularly). Most people simply want a fragrance to make the day a little more pleasant for themselves and for those around them, not because they want to wear a work of \\"art\\" whose complexity and depth are going to make heads turn or spark a discussion about the relative merits of gourmand chypres and aromatic fougeres. Hence the incomprehension and hurt feelings that have greeted some of the harsher reviews in this book.<br /><br />Assuming that one buys into the premise that perfume is a pure art, the authors, in general, seem to have excellent (i.e., informed, refined, and considered) taste--except when it comes to reviewing the work of their friends. Turin, for example, rates Calice Becker's Beyond Paradise Men as one of the top ten masculines currently in production. Since it isn't very expensive I decided to take a chance and buy it blind on his recommendation. The highly synthetic headache-in-a-bottle I got stuck with isn't terrible, I suppose, but if it's one of the top ten masculines that money can buy in early 2008, then I'm Jacques Guerlain. In a different part of the book I discovered that Turin is good friends with Becker. Ah ha... I don't mean to suggest that Turin was cynically shilling for a friend, but rare is the man who is immune to the tender, insidious persuasions of friendship. I'm certain no one else on the planet would rate that fragrance quite so highly. Such are the dangers inherent in taking the word of a consummate industry insider without a huge grain of salt. Turin also awards points for historical importance to fragrances he can't even stand to be around--Opium, for example. This, I think, is taking the \\"perfume as art\\" shtick a little too far. When reviewing fragrances that knock their socks off (especially a fragrance saturated with some deep personal significance) both authors (but Sanchez in particular) tend to wax poetic and come off the rails in terms of actually describing the fragrance. Some of this lyricism is quite affecting, but alas too much of it sounds like an exercise for a creative writing workshop, and the straining for effect turns tiresome. The humor, too, is witty in spots but tends consistently towards juvenile mockery and inane plays on perfumes' names.<br /><br />All of these caveats aside, this is a very informative and often entertaining book. If you love fragrances, it is clearly a must-buy because it offers an excellent idea of which to sample next. If it educates consumers to stop buying and chides producers to stop making the cheap and and often hideous potions flooding the market, it will have done its job. I've learned a lot from the book and am grateful to the authors for having written it, but in the end it's more trustworthy as a Baedeker than as a Michelin.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|Yet another reason to NOT live in New York City!  Add to the sky-high cost of everything, the congestion and the `tudes of the Noo Yawkers, you now have to deal with marauding monsters.  \\"Cloverfield\\" offers a classic monster movie for the 21st century.  Filmed with a camcorder - or effects that give the film that feel - Cloverfield is a terrifying white-knuckled fright fest.  Well done!    Still, questions linger.  How did a creature this big make its way into Gotham?  It's too big for the subway.  Did it fly in on the Delta Shuttle?  Or, perhaps more likely, came from New Jersey.      \\"Cloverfield\\" evokes \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" in its hand-held camera use and the faux-documentary feel.  It also evokes a sense of the Godzilla movies post World War II, post Hiroshima Japan.  It's vision of disaster aftermath also stirs painful memories of 9/11 as dust and paper fall like snowflakes from the sky.      \\"Cloverfield\\" effectively and disturbingly captures the free floating angst and anxiety of our age, the notion that our lives can suddenly be upturned by forces well beyond our control and ability to understand.      A classic monster movie for the 21st century!
B000PTYPAC|4.0|theres without a doubt a notice in growth between their last cd and riot, but like most people have mentioned, a few good singles cannot carry the cd. also lyrics are somewhat forced and often times cliche. but still a good listen
B00006CJOY|1.0|Don't bother buying this album, even if you're a big fan, like me. It starts well, with the great simple mellow rythm that Manu Chao has. But as soon as the second song kicks in (apart from the intro) you're bombarded with screaming backing vocals and metals, in a ska-like rythm. So far so good. BUT IT KEEPS ON GOING! Till the very last song. This is not at all like the studio albums.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I've heard many of these songs before, but wasn't aware of the album until it was talked about on American Idol.  To put it simply, I absolutely LOVE the CD!  I only wish I would have found it sooner (the album was released the year I was born).  I have become a BIG Carole King fan!  She has timeless appeal.
B0013V33DG|3.0|I can see that my judgment of this newest version of \\"Fille du Regiment' places me in a distinct minority among reviewers here. Perhaps I missed those overriding virtues so many have seen in it, but for my money the performance, except in one area, was about as enjoyable as a root canal. Despite its own absurdities of shifted time setting and even more irrational military alliances, the Ciofi/Florez version, I'd argue, has more to offer grown-up opera lovers than this childish cartoon, a compendium of the excesses and cliches of allegedly \\"cutting-edge\\" Regie theater.    First of all, as several others have noticed, there is a marked ugliness distinguishing the sets; indeed, they are eyesores from the opening curtain to the finish, but a necessity for Eurotrash productions ever on guard against the seductiveness of beauty.    Next, all of the characters onstage, principals and choristers, are kept frenetically \\"busy,\\" on the apparent assumption that the audience is largely composed of Attention Deficit Disorder sufferers. Thus we ascend from an unconvincing chorus line of dancing, pitchfork carrying peasants to a heroine who manically irons, does Chaplin like salutes, and turns cartwheels, and to a hero who late in the action even enters driving a tank onto the stage. As directed here, the usually brilliant singing actress Dessay made me nostalgic for the bad old days of stand and deliver singing, the days when one would no more look at an opera star than stare at a radio. The temptation was strong to shout out to her, \\"Don't do anything for a change! Just stand there!\\" Not only did a straining after \\"too much cute\\" blemish her performance throughout, but she or her director seemed clueless even to recognize when the show was over. Therefore, during the curtain calls, she repeated certain of her earlier \\"stage business\\" maneuvers accompanied by shrieks and parrot-like squawks. Happily, the other principal, the hero sung by Florez, chose or was allowed here to maintain his natural grace and dignity. In my view, the principals were to a person crude caricatures of the more richly comic figures they are in the libretto, and their reconception here is a testimony to the vulgarity of the director. I won't speculate about what the ecstatic reception they were accorded may say about the nascent barbarism of the audience.    Why then the three stars? The lead singers who'd be worth listening to if they were singing the telephone book are the answer. Though I, too, noticed Dessay's tendency toward \\"too much pressure\\" on some fortissimo top notes, giving them a scream-like quality, she is a soprano of prodigious coloratura gifts. When she sang softly, and her director, save for making her pull a ridiculous clothes line about the stage, let her be, she sang a particularly beautiful \\"Il faut partir.\\" Similarly, Florez, freed for several minutes from directorial \\"busyness,\\" was allowed to sing another wonderful \\"Ah! mes amis.\\" In these moments, the opera came alive, though they were at odds with the gross overall vision and tendency of the production. Donizetti, Ciofi and Florez - and opera viewers - were better served in the earlier Teatro Carlo Felice revival.
B0015D3Z4O|3.0|Madonna has so many albums, soo many hits, and one of the most respected pop artist in history.  She the female Michael Jackson of pop and for years have bounced in and out of trends and styles (sex toy outfits to political spokeswoman) this album  comes out and you thrive to compare \\"well I thought was going to sound like the Confessions album\\" which by the way was ok, or \\"I thought it would sound like \\"Ray of Light\\" which is one of my personal favorites.  However at the wonderful age of 50 Madonna is at the point where she going to give you (you like it, oh, I see, you bought the album though, right?! Then I got your money!) type music.  That's fine with me, she's done a whole lot of impressing and disappointing things to her fans throughout her long career she can care less.  What she did care about, however, is giving us a likable album that doesn't try too hard, or give you less than what you expect out of her.<br /><br />Nice album overall, with Madonna kicking things off with \\"Candy Shop\\" with beats by Pharrel who produced most of the album.  Timbaland gives you his explosive horn and heavy base assisted by JT in \\"4 minutes\\" which I thought was ok, I just thought the chorus was a little to corny for me but its and enjoyable song.  The biggest highlights are \\"Miles Away\\" which has that original Madonna vibe, \\"Give it 2 Me\\" sounds like Pharrel played all of the Mega Man (Regular Nintendo) console's to find the perfect beat to this song because that's what it sounds like, but a great song, and \\"Beat Goes On\\" doesn't disappoint either with a decent mumble and grumbling Kanye West.  However, some of the production is a bit over the top like \\"She's Not Me\\" assisted with the weakest chorus on the album by Madonna.  \\"Spanish Lesson\\" should not have been on the album, and \\"Voices is mediocore at best.  The most thought provoking track you'll find here is \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" which is nice but sounds like 50 Cent's \\"Ayo Technology\\" but slightly better.  Overall a nice tasty treat from Madonna.  Hardcore fans will love it, others will download, and then some will just appreciate where Madonna  is in her career and just it take as her just having some good old fashion fun.<br /><br />3 1/2 stars.  Solid album from the Female Pop Legand!e tasty treat from Madonna.

B0013ISU0A|5.0|I have appreciated all of REM's albums for various reasons, and when a band is as talented and tight as REM, it's not hard to do that.  But i am not in the majority, if most press reviews are correct.  Many long-time fans have bolted after 3 texturally thick, lush albums since the departure of drummer Bill Berry.  If you are one of those, come on back, my friend.    The album clocks in at a short 34+ minutes, with most songs barely 3 minutes long, but the driving force of the album makes up for shorter songs.  The first single \\"Supernatural Superserious\\" is one of the best REM singles since Automatic.  Other highlights include \\"Accelerate\\", \\"Hollow Man\\", \\"Mr. Richards\\", and \\"I Wanna DJ\\", which appeared on their most recent live album.  Every song is peter Buck-guitar driven, with few acoustic instruments, keyboards, or even pianos.  Mike Mills's trademark backing vocals, which have been noticably low key on \\"Up\\", \\"Reveal\\" and \\"Around the Sun\\" are back and provide a wonderful foil to Michael Stipe's forceful lead.    Every song hits hard but maintains the pop craftwork that REM fans have loved for over 25 years.
B000VBP38C|1.0|I wasn't so sure I'd like this version of the story, since I love the BBC production so much. But despite my reservations, I went ahead and watched it anyway. How I regret that decision. If I could it less than one star, I would. The story was rushed, and not just so they could trim it down to standard feature film length. The characters were portrayed all wrong, and I winced at their delivery on many occasions. The casting was okay, but how Keira Knightley received an Oscar nomination, and a BAFTA award, for this lackluster, uninspired portrayal of Lizzy is beyond me. She was dreadful. The writing was equally as bad, as they cut out many of Austen's original lines and scenes in order to put in their own weaker ideas. The scenery and cinematography were the only good points of the entire film. If you've never read the book, you'd probably enjoy this. If you have, don't bother. Skip it and watch the best adaption: the BBC miniseries with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.

0307387151|1.0|Absolutely hated this book. I didn't read it all the way through, but I figure 260 pages of literary torture was enough. How this book has been so well received and turned out a movie is beyond my comprehension. This book was entirely inaccessible and boring. I hated the long winded laments on architecture and gardens and I hated and didn't identify with any of the characters. This has been the worst book I've read in a decade at least.     After finding out the ending to this book after getting half way through it, I realized that the end could never justify the means. Many people disagree with this, but I just can't be bothered to read the rest of this book as it's more effective than ambien at putting me to sleep.
B0000A0DRY|3.0|Jefferson Airplane's legendary album Surrealistic Pillow is surrealistic indeed.  Jefferson Airplane came on the scene in the 1965 and after 1970 broke off into two bands, Jefferson Airplane and Hot Tuna.  The band was made up of lead signer, Grace Slick, lead guitarist, Jorma Kaukonen, and drummer, Spencer Dryden.  The band was introduced into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996.   Surrealistic Pillow with the sounds and the emotions provoked, have a distinct impact on the listener.  Specifically, in the song \\"In the Mourning\\", the vocals are altered to be those usually attributed to the blues and the harmonica is also utilized to bring on that \\"bluesy\\" feel.  This album also has the psychedelic style used by many in the 1960's.  This is most evident in \\"White Rabbit\\", a song that is a mix between Alice and Wonderland and drugs.  What makes this song so psychedelic is the slow pace of the guitar, lyrical content, and the vocals themselves.  The pace of the guitar is slow throughout with no solos and there is no real point at which the song picks up.  The lyrical content consists of fairytale ideas with the story of Alice and her adventure.  Also, the song speaks of \\"mushrooms and smoking caterpillars \\"which are obvious drug references.  The vocals are just as the guitar: slow moving in pace, although, Slick's vocals build at the end to create a strong and dramatic finish.     Surrealistic Pillow also affects the way a person feels by toying with their emotions.  Many of the songs provoke a feeling of tranquility, happiness, and romance.  In the song \\"Today\\", romance is most palpable in the lyrics.  The main theme of the song is of love and how it changes the person for the better.  Happiness is shown in \\"My Best Friend\\" with a joy felt when one falls in love with a close friend.  Tranquility can be felt throughout the song \\"Comin' Back to Me\\", with the gentle, soothing sound of the flute and the acoustic guitar.     I felt overall that the music was good.The vibe of the music was energizing and moving all at the same time.  The lyrics of the songs brought about many positive emotions; I felt a sense of tranquility and happiness.  However, the tranquility and happiness were interrupted by the placement of \\"Embryonic Journey\\".  I found it awkward that a song with no words was placed amongst a sea of lyrical songs; it is strange to the ear to hear a lyrical song and then have a drastic change to a song were lyrics would be expected yet they do not come.    Jefferson Airplane's album Surrealistic Pillow portrays the ideals of an era.  This particular generation valued love, friendship, peacefulness, happiness and even altered states of conscience.  Grace Slick's voice is arguably one of the best and most powerful voices in the history of Rock and Roll and she idolized by many aspiring singers.  The vocals, instruments, and lyrics, capture a moment in time and allows you to experience the moment time and time again.
B0015D3Z4O|2.0|What can one say about \\"Hard Candy\\" without feelings of revulsion and disappointment? To say that this is Madonna's worst album would be an understatement (for years, I held that her \\"Evita\\" soundtrack was the worst thing she had recorded, but this is much, much inferior to that).<br /><br />I don't know what's worse - the typical Timbaland beats that are here seem like an afterthought (after delivering some of his best beats for Aaliyah and Nelly Furtado, he seems lost and directionless on this record). And Justin Timberlake's appearance is both misguided and desperate (its a pity that Madonna even had to 'reach out' to a 'hip, younger act' in order to stay relevant).<br /><br />And staying relevant is exactly the problem. When compared to the greatest album of her career (\\"Ray of Light\\"), this album is both laughable and useless. It has no creative spark, no 'wow' moment, and absolutely no good tunes. The most 'catchy' thing here is the opening to \\"4 Minutes\\", which itself is not saying much. The production on \\"She's Not Me\\" is a little interesting, but Madonna's Minnie Mouse-ish vocal antics on this one wasn't really very good at all. And what can one say about the flabbergastingly bad \\"Incredible\\", which tries to be addictive but just ends up being annoying.<br /><br />Through it all, we have those trademark Timbaland beats. On all those Missy Elliot albums, Timbaland managed to raise his bar and outdo even himself. His best work, in my opinion, came on Aaliyah's 1996 masterpiece \\"One in a Million\\" (Timbaland himself admitted that he could never outdo the brilliance of that CD). As a longtime Timbaland follower, it irks me that he has lost some of his edge and uniqueness. Here is one stop-start, slightly Middle Eastern sounding beat after the other, as if they were produced in a carbon copy factory with no creative input whatsoever.<br /><br />Two demos from this album leaked last year - \\"Candy Shop\\" and \\"The Beat Goes On\\". The latter has been reworked into probably what the producers thought would be a 'club banger', but it just sounds embarrassing. The demo version was far more addictive and infectious - the new version ruins it. The opening track, \\"Candy Shop\\", sounded great as a demo, but here is just flat and not very good at all. Even as a longtime Madonna supporter, you will be left bewildered and fatigues by this thoroughly overblown and empty album - it certainly left me feeling very surprised. Its the musical equivalent of Jason Castro's shocking performance of \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\" on American Idol. Translation : Really, really bad.<br /><br />By the time the final track, \\"Voices\\" kicks in, you are already quite disconnected from the absurdity of the album. With school-girlish lyrics that even Ashanti wouldn't sing in this day and age, its a wonder Madonna thought that this album was in releasable condition. It most certainly is NOT. At best, this is a collection of 'funky' sounding demos that should never have seen the light of day.<br /><br />There are far more underrated pop masterpieces out there that deserve your attention. Madonna will sell copies of this album just because she's Madonna, but if you want to listen to some really good, repeat-play music, then check these albums out : \\"Come and Get It\\" by Rachel Stevens, \\"Impossible Princess\\" by Kylie Minogue, \\"Neon Nights\\" by Dannii Minogue, \\"Speak for Yourself\\" by Imogen Heap, and \\"Love Trap\\" by Susheela Raman. Avoid this one - you really aren't missing anything.<br /><br />Two Stars. And I think thats generous.would be a 'club banger', but it just sounds embarrassing.

B000TGCR3I|5.0|The title of this review is what a friend of mine told me after he watched this little animation masterpiece. I'm not an anime fan, but I developed a certain taste for Japanese movies while I lived in Japan, six years ago. I don't know what to say, except this: You'll enjoy this film even if you watch it with the volume down, because, visually, this is like tapestry. Every inch of the screen will give you something interesting to look at. It's like Hieronymus Bosch in LSD. Now, when it comes to the narrative, it goes from dramatic to fantastic to poetic in seconds. My friend's reference to Kitano has to do with the way this film pays homage even to yakuza movies. And then, the DVD comes with some behind-the-scenes candy. I'd really like to watch this in HD.

1416914293|1.0|If there is one good thing about Cassandra clare's writing is that it is a perfect tool in the classroom to teach you how not to write a book. The book, and the first book in the trilogy are both extremely derivative from various well known sources such as Buffy, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and Star Wars. This is something that is unexcusable. This isn't like jk rowling creating the mythos of the deathly hallows based on a ancient midevil moral fable, or Tolkein baseing the Lords of the Rings on a old norse saga. This is the example of a author who dosent want to do the work in creating a rich tapestry, and simple weaves a dishtowel filled with plot holes, cliches, and mary sues.    Serious readers dont want to read books with main characters that are flat, and can do no wrong. Writing is about conflict, and its hard to get into the conflict of a story when it is nagated by the fact that the main character goes from being a zero to a hero immediatly. People want to read books about characters with flaws and obstacles. People dont want to read what they already have seen in famous movies and books.    Poorly edited, with prose that makes reguler purple prose look at white, eloquent, sophisticated writing, The mortal instruments trilogy so far two books in lacks depth, and dosent make up for it with new ideas. It is highly pathetic when books written by authors for 6-9 year olds far outstrips a YA novel in quality and creativity.    Also, its kinda lame that the person Amazon has posted as praising the book is not only a long time friend of the author, and therefore biased, but the person who pushed through a publication deal for a writer already famous for plagerisem. she might not be copying text word for word with character names changed anymore, but she certianly isent creating new and interesting plot elements.    If you want a good book, look elsewhere.
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|I had all but given up hope for anything worhtwhile from R.E.M.    Accelerate is excellent. No real clunkers. Short and sweet.     Favorite selections include man-sized wreath, accelerate, mr. richards.    Well worth the price of admission.
B000ZINGIK|5.0|I have to say this does not sound like Avantasia. Avantasia is that fantasy story that was told through Metal Opera Pt 1&2. This is more of a personal, abstract story - more Tobias Sammet and the sound of the music is not the style of the first two Avantasia albums. But nonetheless, I don't rate this album as an Avantasia album, but the wonderful music of Tobias Sammet. It doesn't even need a name to me and all I care is that Mr. Sammet wrote this music. I can't even call this album power metal as most of the songs lack that epic feel and melodic elements that power metal fans are familiar with. In fact, I don't know what to call it other than heavy metal.    Anyway, the album itself. The only thing familiar with Avantasia on this record is that it features several guests from different bands - Michael Kiske, Jorn Lande, Roy Khan, even Alice Cooper! Melodies on this album aren't what you'd hear with old Avantasia and Edguy, but the melodies do fit well into the song - I have to say it's more emotional. Tobias Sammet's voice is still that strong almost Bruce Dickinson voice Edguy fans are familiar with, and the melody he uses on this album is very diverse even branching out to some 80s pop/rock ballad styles (like in Lost In Space and I Don't Believe In Your Love). There are still some almost power metal speed songs in Devil In The Belfry and Shelter From The Rain, and some straightforward heavy songs like Twisted Mind and Toy Factory - this album is very diverse. The song Carry Me Over is too modern rock for my tastes, it's decent at most but I'll sing along to all the songs on this album. Ballads like What Kind Of Love and Lost In Space are so heartfelt, but I absolutely love the melodies on this album.    To me, Avantasia's The Scarecrow does not sound like the first 2 albums, and it's a ways from Edguy, but Tobias Sammet states clearly that he wanted to do something a little different, and personal this time as a risk it may be commercially, but he's the artist so it's up to the artist to present their art in the way they want to. Me being a big fan of Sammet, I love all his works and the diversity he puts into it. I recommend this album to fans of Tobias Sammet's music.

B00104QSOM|4.0|There Will Be Blood is a good movie that tries too hard to be a classic.  The movie follows Daniel Plainview, an oil man, as he builds his company by buying up land and drilling.  Along the way, he encounters various rural people (some of whom stand in his way), and a few real tragedies occur.  It's interesting to see how Plainview acts increasingly insane in reaction to these situations.  As you can see, the plot is really thin.  This would be a three star movie if the Plainview character weren't so fascinating.  The ending is maybe the weirdest thing I've seen lately.  The movie tries to be \\"artsy\\" in many spots, which I normally like, but it just can't seal the deal in the end.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|This movie could quite possibly be my absolute favorite movie of all time.  By no means am I implying that this is the greatest movie ever made, it is quite simply, for what its worth, my personal favorite.  And by no means is it a \\"guilty pleasure\\" - it has every right to be listed among the top films of all time.  After all, the very qualities that make it my personal favorite are qualities that make this movie truly stand out above the majority, critically.<br /><br />This is a movie that should be shown in every film school in order to teach the ingredients necessary to make a truly great motion picture, for you could analyze any one facet of the film, be it the directing, the acting, the cinematography, and write a thesis paper on it.  From a directing standpoint, you have Kubrick's incredible attention to detail and perfectionist eye; and you have his masterful ability to bring out the best in his actors.  From an acting standpoint, you have Peter Sellers and George C Scott at their absolute best - which is a bold statement.  You also get a perfect example of how to take a small budget and not only tear down the illusion of its limitations, but actually achieve complete freedom from a modest financial backing.  This movie takes place in about four different spaces and not once is it limited by this, but in fact, greatly benefits from it.  The craziness, the claustrophobic paranoia, is only heightened by the surroundings.  You have a script of sheer wit, a powerfully funny, almost dangerous, satire that manages to use abstract absurdity to clearly drive home a very clear, real danger - Or in other words, it is a satire that achieves its purpose absolutely.  You have a story set in a specific moment in world history, but a story beyond setting and to the heart of the human spirit - in all its fallacy, craziness, and absurdity - Which leads me to the very thing that has sold me on this film in the first place: the sheer entertainment factor of it all.  You can analyze this film to death, but you cannot avoid how downright entertaining the whole production of Dr Strangelove is  - the sheer genius of Kubrick's part was making this adaptation into a satire in the first place - for recognizing the insanity of political power and understanding that laughter is sometimes the best means to express horror.  He has never been more on the money, regardless of how incredibly effective his other films have been, as well.<br /><br />Regardless of whether watching for the first time, or the hundredth time: analyze, dissect or marvel, but above all else, grab your popcorn, lean back, and simply enjoy this entertaining film.this film to death, but you cannot avoid how downright entertaining the whole production of Dr Strangelove is  - the sheer genius of Kubrick's part was making this adaptation into a satire in the first place - for recognizing the insanity of political power and understanding that laughter is sometimes the best means to express horror.

1423101464|5.0|I've really enjoyed each of the installments of Percy Jackson's adventures.  I bought this newest one before a road trip and finished it in one day.  This is a series that captures the imagination and leaves you anxiously anticipating the next one.  I highly recommend it!

My wish is to learn more of what Vianna Stibal has to give. She is a  great gift to the world.  There is more to learn, more to´experience, more to trust the process and God.    warmly   Kerstin Warkentin/Germany
0553582038|1.0|It is hard to believe how bad this book is. Like many readers, I love the earlier Song of Fire and Ice books. That is why it is hard to believe how boring and tiresome this novel is by comparison. The book goes on and on, tediously focusing on the least interesting storylines. The book is just filler, and pretty dull filler at that. How disappointing.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I bought this movie for my grandchild and it is wonderful. Not only  did they enjoy it, so did I. The service was fantastic. I received  it fast and in perfect condition. Everything was great! I will use   Amazon.com for future purchases without hesitation. Thank you so much.

0634049011|5.0|There's no substitute for knowing what you're doing when you are learning an instrument.  This book will take you a long way but you must be willing to put in some time with it.  Personally, I find it almost addictive with it's worksheets.  My son calls them puzzles.      Figure on taking a year to work through the material.  Getting in a hurry will cause confusion and you'll just have to back up and start again.  I find that for me I absolutely have to finish each worksheet several times before it really takes root.  My routine is to spend maybe fifteen minutes or so a day in the Guitar Fretboard Workbook and then go on to my regular practice.      This is highly recommended.  If I had found it years ago I wouldn't be struggling with my playing now.
044024238X|2.0|A longtime fan of Sophie Kinsella and the refreshingly witty, surprisingly relatable \\"Shopoholic\\" series, I was disappointed by this book. I expected it to be predictable and even unbelievable, but not plain boring and poorly written. The vocabulary was that of an elementary school student and she must have used the phrase, \\"Never...in my life...\\" a thousand times! It was tough to take. I sped through it to put myself out of my misery. Sorry, Sophie.
B000CNESU8|5.0|This film is a wonderful combination of ideas on what the mass media system is doing to our perceptions of the world and how humanity is in constant struggle with the ways success has taken the place of real human emotions.  It also presents the argument that corporate globalization is an inevitable process that will be to the ultimate benefit of mankind.  A very interesting spin on so many of the most popular conspiracy theories.  This film provokes serious thought on many controversial topics the people of the world are currently facing. Awesome film!
B000G8NY4U|5.0|Totally enjoyed the performance.  Yanni incorporated sounds from a variety of unique musical instruments into his compositions. The men and women Yanni hires to perform his music are truly some of the most gifted in the world. If you liked listening to Yanni's music performed at the Acropolis, be prepared to enjoy a different side of Yanni in his recorded \\"live\\" opening night performance in Vegas.

B000ILZ67S|5.0|This book is great!!! I would really suggest reading the first book in the series first because it is the best one, but it's not nessesary to read it first to understand this one.
B000002HD5|5.0|Wow, the only thing more difficult than listening to this record is writing a review.      A little history.... I saw the title song on MTV's 120 minutes.  It was good.  I heard the song on the radio and it was good.  Just about every song on this CD is \\"good.\\"  The point being, when you listen to it as a whole, each song becomes GREAT.  \\"Gentlemen\\" and \\"Debonair\\" were minor hits, and if you heard those songs and they sounded \\"o.k.\\", trust me when I say that after to listening to CD a few times you will appreciate those minor hits 10 fold.       I bought this CD a few months ago after reading the reviews on Amazon.com. I was blown away.  I really haven't seen such passionate reviews for any record on Amazon.com. Not even the Beatles have any 5 star studio recordings.  Where the listeners/reviewers duped?  Hardly.    I have now been obsessed with this CD for 2 years.  Words can not describe the pain, torment and beauty of this CD.  This is not a CD to listen to while drinking beers and playing pool with your buddies.  This is a solitary CD, to be listened to while sitting in a chair, with a glass of Scotch, and giving it your full attention.  No books or magazines allowed.  Just you and your attention, please.  Only then will you truly understand the genius of this record.    This CD is all about love.  A love that lasted a third of Greg Dulli's life.  A love that ended.  Greg is in horrific pain, and it is obvious.  To write songs that simply say \\"You are a b_tch and I hate you\\" would be way too simple.  This is not that type of record.  Greg accepts responsibility for his failings.  The part that is really scary is that you and I have those same traits and thus, the same failings. To use a tired cliche, Greg points the finger at the female, and simultaneously points three fingers back at himself.  And you and I have at least two of those three traits.    \\"Gentlemen\\" was the first song I heard. It was \\"ok\\" a few months ago, and yet now it is simply brilliant.  I canhonestly say I \\"get\\" that song perfectly when listened to with the rest of the CD.  Every song here works... there is no filler.  Even the instrumental at end works, like a warm bath after at hard day's work in a coal mine.  The instrumental is needed after the emotional devastation caused by this record.    This is not a fun CD to listen to.  In fact, Greg had another singer sing one of the songs because it was too painful for him.  \\"My Curse\\" features Marcy Mays, and she is amazing.  If you were wondering, there is a line where she talks about perfume that the other person is wearing.  This is not a lesbian love song, it is a song written by Greg to a female that he could never sing in the studio because it was too painful.  And if you go to youtube and see the live version of the song sung by Marcy, you will understand why.      My favorite song may by \\"What Jail is Like,\\" but \\"Be Sweet\\" and \\"My Curse\\" are also among my favorites.  \\"Favorite\\" meaning most painful, most like my own life, and most likely to make me cry.      People compare the Afghan Whigs to Nirvana.  They were both on Sub Pop.  \\"Nevermind\\" is brilliant, but it is not \\"Gentlemen.\\"  First, the lyrics on \\"Nevermind\\" can't even come close to \\"Gentlemen.\\"  There are no \\"an albino, a mosquito\\" lyrics on Gentlemen.  This is not to bash Nirvana, but Gentlemen is so much deeper. Second, The Afghan Whigs are great musicians.  If any of you play guitar, you know that \\"Nevermind\\" is a pretty simple album to play, so long as you know what a power chord is.  Not so with \\"Gentlemen.\\"  The Afghan Whigs are real musicians, with a definitely soul influence. Heck, there are even pianos on this CD.     Well, I guess I've rambled for a long time.  If you are still happily with your first girlfriend from 8th grade, then skip this CD.  Get a Hanson or Lady Gaga record instead.  But if you have been emotionally destroyed by the breakup of a relationship anytime in your life, then get this CD. You will understand it.  It will speak to you.  You will be amazed by it, just like 99% of all the others who have reviewed \\"Gentlemen.\\"    And yes.....it really is that good.

0525950079|5.0|I discovered Ken Follets previous book Pillars of the earth and found it oddly addictive.  Who would think building a church would be so facinating.  The next installment - World without an end was, in my opinion, even more addictive.  I especially enjoyed the medical sub theme in this novel and have developed a passion for historical novels.  Well worth the read and expect to look at the world in a more informed way.  Thanks Ken hope there will be another.

Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge and putting it all together in this wonderful great book.
B000HT3Q3M|5.0|I am a long time Al Jarreau fan and bought this on a whim.  What a great CD - I can't stop listening to it!  From the two trading off on their hits Breezin' and Mornin', to Jill Scott's exquisite rendition of God Bless the Child, to Paul McCartney's guest appearance on Bring it on Home to Me, and all the tracks in between, you won't be disappointed.  Trying to pick a favorite song on this CD is like saying, \\"What's your favorite sunset?\\"  They all touch me in a different way. Put this on and enjoy . . .
B000MRAAJM|5.0|D. Attenborough is a great narrator. This series is BBC-typical: phenomenal.  This kind of documentary is soo worth getting on Blu-Ray. In fact, I believe this is the one show that stores should use when demonstrating HD TVs and equipment.    This series covers a large part of the Earth...and every episode will present you with species you probably didn't even know existed! They almost never deal with us men being a problem for our problem. This show is not meant to make you feel bad for destroying our planet (although we should ^^), but they simply present you with the wonderful things that our Blue Planet has to offer.
B0001AVZA8|1.0|I saw this movie has 4 1/2 stars. How? This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life! I bought it as a Christmas present for my boyfriend's mother. I watched it first, and after watching it, I couldn't even give it to her. It would have been an insult. Like \\"here is your crappy gift. this is how much i think of you.\\" I was talking about it to a co worker just describing this terrible movie I had seen and without even saying the title, she said \\"you talking about Something's Gotta Give?\\" She also agreed that it was a terrible movie. (she is twice my age so it's not just because i am young) Bottom line: don't waste your time or money.
0143038419|1.0|I honestly don't know what all the hype for this book was about.  It was the worst book I have ever read. I have read better books as a pre-teen (heck, the Baby-Sitters Club and Goosebumps series are wayy better than this book).  It was definitely a waste of my time. In fact, it was so painful to read, I didn't finish the book. I stopped at the beginning of her Indonesia trip.  Whoever paid her to do this book deserves pity.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|This CD/DVD combo is a stunner. Wow. Difficult to know where to begin in listing all the interesting features of this body of work. I do have a question though: why limit yourself to 10 days and have to run so hard to capture what's here? It cost them something when they didn't have an audio problem figured out when they were recording (or so they thought) B.B. King in a little club in Indianola, Mississippi. When you see and hear what they DID get recorded, you'll be in anguish over whatever it is they missed.<br /><br />I bought this on a recommendation from a friend when we were talking the value, the worth, and the quality of Blues as played by the musicians who made it famous. Personally I don't have much background on Kenny Wayne Shepherd. Prior to this, I always thought he was a 'pretty boy' playing pretty much hard edged electric whiteguy Blues. On these discs, he's playing sideman to some of the real bluesmen left alive. He's very courteous and respectful in his approach to sitting in with these guys, he being the student to the master, and that was nice to see. The fact that he can flat play also helped a lot. ;--)<br /><br />The first thing that will get you is the rhythms. Man, there's nothing out there like what you'll hear these guys (Double Trouble, Stevie Ray Vaughan's band) crank out! The ability to grab you comes from the simplicity of the approach. In many cases, the PLAYING is anything but simple, but you can't miss the message. Not a lot of energy is lost in making a show here. It's all in the music and it's carrying a message we all hear, black or white or any color for that matter. There is definitely a conversation here between you, the listener and viewer, and these players.<br /><br />The Blues... when it's played right as it is here, to me, it's simply the best out there. Pick this one up... and try a little musical meat down close to the bone. In my world, this one's gonna be in Heavy Rotation for quite awhile...
1594489505|5.0|After reading this book a few months ago, I find it hard to read any other book.. I loved \\"Kite Runner\\" as well, but this book is so haunting, I can still remember every little detail - each character, the events, etc.  I have never felt so much emotion from a single book. I tried to read \\"Eat Love Pray\\" right after and that book was so painful to read. Maybe if I read it before reading \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" I would have seen what all the hype was about for \\"Eat Love Pray\\".. In fact I didn't even finish \\"Eat Love Pray\\".  I went on to \\"Friday Night Knitting Club\\" which is extremely dull.. and I'm moving on to \\"Three Cups of Tea\\" which is about Pakistan and the Taliban and whatnot - so I'm HOPING it'll be similar to Khaled's writing..     Read this book NOW!! Best book I EVER, EVER read....
B000ZN802W|3.0|I know I'm not supposed to review a movie based on how it's been adapted from the book, but it was a little disappointing.    The book focuses on how Alex(Chris) touched and affected people around him, which left a big impression on me. Their stories are heartbreaking.    On the other hand the movie focuses on Chris himself (which is an understandable decision as the movie runs for only so long). The trouble is I'm still not able to understand him any better.

0789208547|3.0|This is not a review of Rockwells work as much as it is about the quality of the book. Its a nice big book , with one cover following the other. the quality of color is a bit sub standard and the descriptions at the end make things a bit hard to flip back and forth. A brilliant collection ofcourse but not as nice as I expected. Tom rockwell's best of Norman Rockwell is smaller but way better print quality. I do recommend this book ofcourse for the genius and technique of a great american master.

B00177Y9ZC|1.0|This movie is proof positive that Hayden Christensen's really bad acting as Anakin Skywalker was not some fluke of poor editing or directorial control by George Lucas.  No, this is all Hayden Christensen.  Why people in Hollywood continue to give him major roles when there are so many other male actors out there who are just as good if not better is just beyond me.<br /><br />Could it be those dark overhanging eyebrows?  Seen from a certain angle, it makes him look like a brooding Calvin Klein male model, which is probably what he should be doing for a living instead of pretending to act.  Seen from other angles, however, it makes him look positively early-Neanderthal.<br /><br />As for the rest of the movie, Bleccchhh.  Rachel Bilson couldn't act either and there was absolutely no chemistry between them.<br /><br />The strangest part of the movie is that the younger high school versions of these two characters - Max Theriot and AnnaSophia Robb, were far more attractive, sympathetic actors, who actually looked like they could act.  Rachel Bilson doesn't look or act anything like AnnaSophia Robb and it was quite jarring to see her all of a sudden introduced as the older version of the same character.  It would have been far more interesting to have let the two younger actors continue as older versions of themselves for the rest of the movie.<br /><br />There are SO MANY plot holes in this movie.  Here's just one:  Early in the movie, David Rice picks up this incredibly beautiful blonde in a bar in England.  And then he leaves her, still in bed, for his old girlfriend from high school, who by this time is no longer the beautiful AnnaSophia Robb but has turned into the much plainer and whinier Rachel Bilson.  Maybe that's why he tried to dump her for the rest of the movie.
0061120073|4.0|I've finally gotten the chance to read this book after many recommendations.  It was rather hard to put down, with its compelling plot line, memorable characters, and poignant moments. What I found most interesting was its historic portrayal of Brooklyn as a growing neighborhood and home to European immigrants during the early 20th century -- where the beginning of a developing \\"American\\" political and cultural identity affected the lives of those such as our main character, Francie Nolan.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|What a great product! I was searching for the perfect stroller and found it (the Graco IPO). This organizer made a great product awesome. The organizer has plenty of room for everything I need to keep handy when I am out with the baby. It's sturdy and the velcro straps attach right to the back of my rear seat, so putting it away in the car (and keeping it off the floor) are easy as pie!!
B000XTCBWS|5.0|I'm an audiophile and for me I judge a recording in 2 major aspects, the quality of the performance and quality of the recording.  I'll let you check other sources for opinions about the performance, (in my opinion this performance sets the standard), but one thing I can tell about is the quality of the recording, if you have a good system, this recording gives you a transparent and high fidelity view into the performance and the venue that is rare and wonderful.  Only small disappointment is that if you buy each piece seperately (a bit more expensive) you get a libretto, if you buy it this way you do not, (you can download if from Testament's sight but it's not as nice as a printed one).
B000002ADT|5.0|I had - still have it - the old LP when it first came out in Europe in 1961 on the Fontana label. Bill Evans liner notes were the same - and the tracks in the same order as on the Columbia CD I now have as well.  But Flamenco Sketches has become All Blues - and vice versa.  What happened? I even saw a modern dance performance in Europe set to Flamenco Sketches in the 1960s - which is now the All Blues.  Who exchanged the titles and when? And who got it right - Bill Evans surely seems to say that the original had it right, and the CD re-issue messed it up.  Help anyone?

0060558121|4.0|A man who goes by the name Shadow gets released from prison and before he even makes it home his entire world is turned upside down. He is engaged in conversation by another man who knows an uncomfortable amount about him and tells Shadow he needs his help. After their conversation the story seemingly followed Alice down the proverbial rabbit hole.<br /><br />The book follows Shadow to hell and back, almost literally. He encounters many Gods from probably every region of the world and from every era. The research was definitely thorough, though almost too much so. There may have been a few too many references to Gods that have been long-forgotten. But that is often a complaint of sci-fi/fantasy books, in how they can be too detailed and descriptive.<br /><br />I cannot rave enough about how much I love this plot. The Gods of old, which were brought to the US by whomever, however devout, are facing a great paradigm shift. The old Gods are being edged out in the US by new Gods who represent more commercialized, Capitalistic and technological ideals. Shadow chose sides with the old Gods, but he has no idea if he made the right choice. But he knows all he can do now is see the coming storm through to the end.<br /><br />This book took forever to read, was very bizarre in many parts, and the ending was almost anti-climactic. And I still really enjoyed it. Call me crazy I guess.

B00005JPS7|4.0|While in the Middle East providing a new-product demonstration to the US Armed Forces, super-genius playboy weaponsmaker Tony Stark is ambushed and kidnapped. To buy his freedom from his captors he must construct the new weapon he was showcasing. He decides, instead, to build a suit made of iron to help him escape, a suit powered by an electromagnet that was installed in his chest to prevent shrapnel from entering his heart. Further design modifications and refinements lead Stark to a truly amazing concept which makes him a bonafide superhero.     The movie follows its hero (pun intended) on a series of personality changes. He goes from chick magnet to humble captive and from cocky fly boy to man on a mission. I am sure you can figure out which traits were more entertaining.     I was impressed at first with how much hype was created for this movie. Those involved took a pretty well-known but certainly less-popular comic book character and made it one of the most highly anticipated films in at least recent history. My hat is off to them all for going beyond that and delivering such a fun and energizing movie. They also followed the story well and included at least two teasers as to what we might see sometime into the future (*cough* War Machine and The Avengers *cough*).     The story gets in the way a few times, and it is cheesy comic book story, but I hope you can get past that. With the volume of comic books being adapted to film, most people should be pretty used to that by now. What that story does is form the environment in which the special effects can really shine.     Tony Stark is a stronger personality (and thus a better lead) than either Peter Parker or Bruce Wayne, and Iron Man and the pace of his movie are also significantly more explosive. Since you're now questioning me, I will say that Iron Man was better than any of the Spider-Man movies. And I liked Iron Man for different reasons than Batman, so that is a hard comparison to make, but I think Batman Begins is still the better movie. And we'll see how Mr. Stark does against The Dark Knight later this summer.

0375842209|2.0|If you are looking for an easy read that doesnt require too much thought then this is the book for you. I had read rave review after rave review and found myself very disappointed with the actual book. My problems can be summed up in a couple of points:    1) The characters are all one dimensional. You will know who the good guy is because he will hate Hitler and the Nazis. You will know who the bad guy is because he will be a spit drenched facist. At one point a character gives out about the main character and says that she should be reading Mein Kampf. See now we know to file him under \\"baddies\\". There were just too many broad strokes.    2) I hated the writing style. I mean at the start it was a bit of a novelty. Death popping up to point out the important phrases or to tell us that a certain character would have a sticky end in a few months time.  This happened so often that I lost track of all the things I had been forewarned about. Most of it was done for shock value. One character's fate in particular was dropped in solely to provoke gasps. But when that character met their fate it didnt live up to what we had been warned about. Sorry for all the vagueness but I really don't want to spoil it for those who havent already read it.    3) It was way too heavy handed. At one point a German does something that paints them in a good light. The following two sentances are:    \\"Was this Germany? Nazi Germany?\\"     Why not hand me the sledgehammer so I can hit myself over the head with it instead.    All in all I give it two stars, because as a children's book it is very simple with a nice story about people we like doing nice things. But as an adult piece of fiction it was just way too clunky for me.

B0017APPT8|4.0|Men In Black is a spoof/sci-fi/action flick about a super-secret cross between the Immigration and Naturalization Service, FBI X-Files division, and a disinformation office.  Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are, respectively, a seasoned agent and a new recruit who work to find, legalize, track and police aliens from other worlds, and to hide the fact that such aliens exist.  Aliens are given disguises and allowed to live among us as long as they don't cause too much trouble.  There is apparently a lot of latitude in enforcing that requirement, since it turns out that Newt Gingrich, Sylvester Stallone and Dennis Rodman are actually aliens.<br /><br />Beyond that set-up, the plot exists mainly as a vehicle on which to hang a bunch of gags, some very odd characters, and action sequences.  And that's enough.  The heroes fight aggressor aliens and save the Earth and a very small galaxy while remaining (mostly) cool and making wisecracks.  What more could you ask for?<br /><br />This is a fun movie with lots of elaborate special effects and sets that ought to really benefit from the hi-def treatment.  The new Blu-ray release will have a bunch of special features, but only a few not taken from previous releases.

B0015UKX7Y|5.0|This is a rare find: A duo music experience paying virtually NO regard to modern diametrics and demands. The sound of this music is filtered through a haze of 60s influences (the Hollies, The Walker Brothers) distinctly credited, duly noted ...and equally delivered as a ready made classic for anyone interested. I can only hope that those interested will harp on the music's beauty, value and artistry in a way that impacts modern tastemakers.<br />Huh? Try it. Buy it. And don't \\"why it\\" to death for how it is out of time. Make it IN time.<br />And if that fails to convince just buy it for the cover.

1400034779|3.0|I appreciated this story because it was a quick read, easily comprehended, pleasant and entertaining.  It was fun to watch Mma Ramotswa reasoning her way through her investigations as a rookie private investigator with no previous sleuthing experience.  And given the apparent perceived gender inequalities in Botswana, she navigated the waters of gender prejudice quite well.<br /><br />However, a couple aspects of the story were difficult for me to get past.  My first hang-up was the predictability of her investigations.  In most (but not all) of the cases that arrived at her agency, the apparent (and inevitably final) solution to the mystery was fairly clearly obvious before she ever got close to solving it.  Most notably, the eventual solutions to the situation of Dr. Patel's daughter's activities, the case of the outstanding/inept doctor at the hospital, and the missing finger at the machine shop were quite obvious as soon as the complainant laid out the case to Mma Ramotswe.<br /><br />Secondly, there were some unreal aspects to Mma Ramotswe's investigative activity that even a fictional novel could not allow for.  For example, the surveillance activity conducted by Mma Ramotswe of her investigative suspects.  As a single individual she was able to conduct effective surveillances of her subjects without ever \\"getting made,\\" and only infrequently did she lose her subject.  In real detective work, it can be exceptionally difficult to effectively follow the subject of an investigation with a single vehicle.  Such a surveillance technique would typically result in losing the subject in heavy traffic, at stop lights, etc.  Following a vehicle in lighter traffic runs the risk of discovery, effectively tipping-off the subject that they're being followed.<br /><br />Finally, it's quite apparent that McCall-Smith is a big fan of Botswana, but I found the chapters and deviations devoted to Botswanan life, culture, etc, a bit distracting.  I found myself wanting to get on through apparent reflections of African life and the author's musings of life in Botswana, to Mma Ramotswe's next life saving adventure.<br /><br />I realize these are probably minor criticisms and shouldn't detract from the overall pleasantness of the story, but I personally had a hard time getting past them.  That said, I would recommend this story if one is in the mood for a quick, simple and not particularly involved or complex group of short mysteries.  I would also continue to the next books of the series.ions of African life and the author's musings of life in Botswana, to Mma Ramotswe's next life saving adventure.

B000001GK0|5.0|This recording truly encompasses dynamic range to the extreme. Here we are presented with 4 astonishing elements: one of the greatest conductors to ever lift a baton; one of the greatest pianists to grace a keyboard (and at quite a young age, too); a famed orchestra that has been one of the world's leading orchestras for over 100 years; and a wonderful instrument on which these masterpieces are skillfully played. The pianissimos are graceful and articulate while the fortissimos are grand and full. The technique of Zimerman is flawless and pairs well with his masterful musicianship and expression. Karajan brings soloist and orchestra together in a perfect combination of elements to create a well-rounded recording of two of the supreme concerti for piano in the keyboard repertoire. This is definitely a must for fans of the Grieg Concerto, so don't hesitate in purchasing this recording!
0312330537|2.0|Finally, purchased and read it while up in Thailand last year.  It came well recommended and the reviews here seem utterly uncritical, so it falls to me ... etcetera.<br />The book works often, and the man certainly does hit a stride in many places, however it needs to be said that he over writes (like Peter Carey does..) some fabric of the book, and at other times the narrative disintergrates into a clearly two dimensional construct; characters can be wooden at times, and situations also (wild dog pack attack outside the slum) sometimes seem simplistic and unlikely.  While I enjoyed the bulk of the book, I did think it could have been edited severely and would have benefited from a less is more approach.  Florid at times, hackneyed at times, and sometimes just cartoonish.  Never the less, I admire the story telling here, and feel the book deserves it's reputation.  Whether it really is actual fact, or just very loosly based on the authors experiences, should be judged as part of the readers overall appreciation of the work.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|I don't think \\"The Constant Gardener\\" is what one would call a conventional thriller.  The culprits are pretty transparent early on but what I think concerns the makers of the film is not whodunit but rather how to shed light on their malfeasence.  In the meantime the film offers a lot of food for thought about how the Third World is exploited by the major pharmaceutical companies and their corporate and government accomplices.  I think the film also concerns itself with passive diplomat Justin Quayle(Ralph Fiennes) bringing closure to the horrific murder of his activist wife, Tessa(Rachel Weisz).  Fiennes is nothing short of brilliant in an understated performance that suggests the anger and frustration that lurks within.  Weisz deservedly won an Oscar in an impassioned and effervescent turn so much so that Justin's loss is the audience's loss as well.  A truly great film not to be missed.
0618918248|5.0|The God Delusion Provides sound reasoning for disbelieving religion, and at the same time provides a general overview of a world-view based on fact.  I was very disappointed in Dawkins for not articulating his arguments as well as I thought possible, it wasn't so much the point by point smack down of Christian theism that I expected.  This is partly due to Dawkins writing style, and maybe partly due to his upbringing as an atheist.  Those of us who grew up in the church, by happen-chance of our upbringing, have a more intimate view, by our own previous beliefs, of the mind-set of believers.  Still it is an mind-opening book which I hope will continue to excite thinking, and perhaps conversion to rationalism.  That is the purpose of the book:  To convert god-having spiritualist to god-less atheist.

B000R8YC1S|4.0|Labyrinth was the second fantasy film directed by [[ASIN:B0009ULBGS Muppet]] creator Jim Henson. Though the tone of this film is not as dark as its predecessor, The Dark Crystal, it has become a classic in its own right.    Jennifer Connelly (in an early role) stars as Sarah, an imaginative teenager who when left to baby-sit her infant brother, calls upon the goblins of her favorite story to take him away. But when the goblins do she is forced to defy the Goblin King, Jareth, who is superbly played by David Bowie. In order to retrieve her baby brother she must venture deep into a magical labyrinth. There she encounters Hoggle, a curmudgeonly dwarf who begrudgingly helps her on her quest. She also befriends host of other memorable characters including Ludo, a giant hairy behemoth and Sir Didymus, a valiant knight who happens to be a two-and-a-half foot tall and one-eyed dog. She also meets a talking worm that steals the picture for the few moments he's on screen.    The story deals with delicate subject matter, mainly what it means to grow from a girl into a woman, but it manages to do so in a sensitive, fun and entertaining way. And the music by David Bowie helps to keep things light. Monty Python's Terry Jones wrote the screenplay and this results in the film's comedic tone. But what really makes this cult classic so unique is the wizardry of Jim Henson's team of puppeteers and special effects designers. The production design is also inspired and even award worthy.  The film is a must-have for fans of fantasy films or Jim Henson.    The Anniversary Edition of Labyrinth includes the following special features: a new high definition film transfer, a new audio commentary by conceptual designer Brian Froud, Inside the Labyrinth vintage documentary, the new Kingdom of Creatures & The Quest for Goblin City documentaries, photo and art galleries, and previews.

B00104QSOM|2.0|I do not regard this as a great film.  Nor do I understand why Daniel Day-Lewis, a fine actor, won the Academy Award for impersonating John Huston's performance diction flawlessly.  But there you go.  People rave about this film and Day-Lewis won the Oscar(tm).  If you look back over the history of these awards you will find a lot of head scratchers that must have made a lot more sense in their time than they do today.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis plays Daniel Plainview who is a monster.  In retrospect, the world this character inhabited would have been much better off if he had simply died in the pit we see him working in at the beginning of the movie.  Plainview is a man driven by a soul emptying hatred of everything and everyone which must arise from the same regard for himself.  He is a solitary man whose only appetite is to build his business and make money so, as he later says, he can get away from everything.  We see him make no friends, he has not a single woman in his life (nor are there many female roles in the movie).  He acquires his son when a hand dies in a pit.  Rather than send the kid to relatives, he takes him on as a prop so when he tells farmers and investors that he is a family man with family feelings he has some evidence.<br /><br />How he treats the boy, H. W. he is called, shows how conflicted Daniel is.  He shows genuine delight in teaching the boy his trade and demonstrating his prowess in front of him.  But when the boy is made deaf in an explosion at a well, Daniel sends him off in a very cruel fashion because his value as a prop is diminished.  However, I think it is also because a deaf son can't fully share his world.  It is interesting that they never try to communicate by writing to each other.  Was the boy not taught to read or write?  An indication of this comes when someone claiming to be Daniel's half-brother shows up.  H.W. looks at pictures in the man's diary but holds the book so the writing is upside down and he never looks at it or turns it around to read it.<br /><br />The central conflict in the movie is Daniel's lifelong conflict with Eli Sunday, a religious zealot whose entire ambition centers on building his Church of the Third Revelation.  Daniel came to the Sunday land because Eli's twin brother Paul told him about the easy oil there.  Daniel paid him and then found a way to pay Eli's father, Abel Sunday (significance in the name? The innocent victim?), quail money (as Daniel told H.W.) instead of oil money.  You see, Daniel came to the land with H.W. posing as a man interesting in quail hunting rather than admitting he was looking for oil.  Daniel demonstrates his ability to make bitter enemies needlessly when Eli tries to strong arm his way to bless the new well.  Instead, Daniel introduces Eli's sister and blesses the well himself.  Later, Eli finds a way to humiliate Daniel (to be fair, he uses the same method to humiliate each convert).  At the end of the movie, Daniel returns the insult.<br /><br />But the grimness of the movie and Daniel's inability to allow anyone to exist outside of his own universe of dominance is a horror.  He commits tremendous emotional and/or physical violence against anyone who fails to stay within the bounds he has determined for them in his own warped mind and empty soul.  The problem is that this is a character who is so sick in the soul that he is mostly useless in telling anything but a singular horror story.  Do the writers suppose that all oil men or business men are possessed of this sickness?  I can't believe they would buy into such a childish notion.  Nearly every business person I know enjoys their success, using their work to improve the lives of others, and has great friendships.  Yes, there are exceptions, but not to the cartoonish extremes of Plainview.<br /><br />The film also wears its artiness on its sleeve.  Like a lot of middle-brow movies pretending to be high-brow art, they are clever with some interesting elements that invite a level of thought that the viewer can congratulate himself (or herself) for formulating.  However, the movie is just too ham fisted and unrealistic to be high art.  Since there are long stretches without dialog and the images during those stretches don't really do much, the musical score provides us with strong and loud cues telling us when to be disoriented, anxious, and so forth.  It isn't that the music selected isn't interestingly done, but that it doesn't form a unity and is far too obvious in its intention to be an artistic achievement.  It is more like advertising or melodrama in purpose even if the music itself is drawn from actual musical artworks.  One doesn't congratulate a commercial for using Beethoven by calling it art.<br /><br />Daniel finally gets his riches and builds a huge empty mansion that is more prison than palace.

However, the movie is just too ham fisted and unrealistic to be high art.  Since there are long stretches without dialog and the images during those stretches don't really do much, the musical score provides us with strong and loud cues telling us when to be disoriented, anxious, and so forth.  It isn't that the music selected isn't interestingly done, but that it doesn't form a unity and is far too obvious in its intention to be an artistic achievement.  It is more like advertising or melodrama in purpose even if the music itself is drawn from actual musical artworks.  One doesn't congratulate a commercial for using Beethoven by calling it art.    Daniel finally gets his riches and builds a huge empty mansion that is more prison than palace.

B000065BPB|5.0|Outstanding headphones! Excellent sound and clarity. Ear pieces are well padded and comfortable, and the cord has plenty of length, yet coils nicely so it doesn't create a bunch of jumbled wires.  This is my second Sennheiser HD-280 Pro headphones, and I love them both. I use one with my laptop computer, the other with my desktop computer.  I will soon be purchasing a 3rd Sennheiser HD-280 Pro headphones for my home entertainment system.  A heck of a good headphones at a reasonable price, with quick delivery.  I'd call that a winning combination all the way around.  It's easy to give this 5 stars!

B0002V7OI8|4.0|This film was totally overshadowed by Armageddon (they came out during the same summer), but is far the better movie. It lacks the unrelenting action of Armageddon (which is too much for me personally - makes me queasy), but more than makes up for it in character development and believable plot. This is a thinking person's disaster flick; it feels honest in the way the plot moves forward, rather than contrived. Definitely worth a look - if you like a bit of intelligence and believability in your sci-fi flicks, this is a great choice.
B00008WT49|5.0|I listen to this SACD using my do-it-yourself made vacuum tube amplifier plus Beyerdynamic DT 770 headphones. The sound is excellent, very detailed,  Norah voice very breathy and warm. However, sometimes I can hear a slight hiss from recording and I have an impression that some songs were recorded with different settings since the \\"color\\" of the sound is somewhat different  (particularly when compared the first track with the rest). The other thing is that the grandpiano is a bit too loud in some songs and \\"covers\\" the voice. Anyway, these are minor things and they do not spoil general, very positive impression. I really had fallen in love with that voice :)
B00003CXV4|1.0|I think I can honestly say that `Sweet November' is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  It's actually so bad that I'm at a loss for words at really what to say here.  I am truly baffled by all the four and five star reviews, but I'm not here to judge other reviewers, just this atrocious movie.<br /><br />`Sweet November' has the disadvantage of sporting a preposterous story that makes little to no sense and is chuck full of so many clich&eacute;s one may can guess each and every plot point just by reading the film description.  Sara Deever is a sweet single woman who engages in month-long relationships with men in order to help them change their lives for the better.  She shies away from any real commitment because she is very ill and so she makes sure she warns them before agreeing to take them on that they are not allowed to fall in love with her, no matter what.  Her `November' is Nelson Moss, an advertising executive who is a workaholic, devoid of any real life.  After a chance meeting she decides to invite him to live with her so she can `help' him.<br /><br />Yes, it's a ridiculous premise.  No self respecting woman would invite total strangers to come live with them, and no sane male would take her up on the offer.  He may go home for the night, but he's not moving in.<br /><br />I understand that films don't always make sense; they are in fact works of fiction; and if the plot were the only issue I may be compelled to forgive it a little and enjoy what else I can from the film, but the plot is the least of its worries.  There is a major problem with the two stars of this film, especially Reeves, but Theron does little to rectify the problem.  Keanu Reeves is seriously one of the worst actors of our generation.  He has almost no emotional depth and is almost always one-note.  In fact the only role he seemed suited for and actually delivered in was `The Matrix', for it was the only role that required his dry personality.  Here he falls flat and proves uninteresting and ridiculously mechanical.  His performance is laughably bad, nothing honest coming from him in any way.  Theron is better, but she can't rescue the film.  She is charming but her quirkiness tends to be a drawback.  Her character comes off as rather insane instead of interesting.  She is gorgeous, there is no denying that, but pretty is not enough.<br /><br />I honestly thought that this movie was going to be sweet, but I can't stress enough how deceiving the films title really is.  I want to rent the original now, just to see if it is as horrible.  Somehow I doubt that.  I took my ex-girlfriend to see this film when it was first released, thinking that it would be a great date movie, but it proved to be a horrible experience for the both of us, and while I don't blame this movie for our eventual breakup (which happened less than a week later) I do find it slightly ironic and like to joke that this movie was our downfall.  I recently caught this movie on Cable and sat through it, just to see if my feelings for the film were tainted by my feelings for my ex, and their not; the movie is genuinely horrendous.<br /><br />If you want to see something romantic and charming this is not the route to go.

B0001BKAEE|1.0|I remember when this film opened in the theaters worldwide to tremendous excitement and anticipation.  It was written up in newspapers, people took off work to see it when it opened the first day.  Theaters were sold out and lines were unbelieveable.  And then the let down and dissappointment that followed.  When I went to see the film, the auditorium for this movie was empty.  And the movie had only been open less than a week.  And it was easy to see why.  The ending of the movie was a terrible dissappoinment. Real life is tough, I like happy endings in my entertainment, and I did not get it here.  I was waiting for Neo to save the day, to reunite with his lover, to either overcome the machines, or to negociate some sort of peaceful co-existance between humanity and the machines.  The wonderful idea, played with in the first two films, that there was, within the machine complex, programs that had gained invidvidual conciousness and action, who wanted to go on existing as individuals and make peace with humanity, was not brought to any kind of fruition here.  Neo died without purpose. The lovers are lost forever. The human race was not saved--the machine world was. The machine world will continue as before, with humanity being used as living batteries.  The free city of Zion, while not totally destroyed, is now no longer secret, and secrecy was their only true defense.  The machines now know where Zion is, and can destroy all free humanity whenever they become too much trouble. Where in the first film, it seemed that Neo was humanity's hope against the machines, it turns out that the machine had used Neo to preserve itself. He dies for nothing; his sacrifice, humanity and love gone to waste. He dies to preserve the machine world.  Personally, I would have preferred that the human race perish than continue forever in this world as fodder for the machine complex.  And what in the world happened to the character of Morpheus?  Morpheus was strong, dignified, a powerfulleader in the first two movies. In this one, his character has totally changed.  He bearly appears onscreen, and when he does, he is fearful, weak, ineffectual and completely useless.  Others take over the leadership role and Morpheus is religated to the background.  Nothing comes of the terrible sacrifices that he suffered.  And the action sequences in the film really did nothing for me.  In one scene, the rogue computer program Agent Smith appears as a plodding giant in a stylized cityscape---for all the world like the Staypuffed Marshmallow man scene from the Ghostbusters!!  Doesn't it occur to anyone in Hollywood that a movie with a happy ending sells better?   This movie ranks in the same dissappointment range as the third movie of the Pirates of the Caribbean does.

0393324818|5.0|I've never followed baseball much, but have always been fascinated by the obsession with statistics in the game. The curious disconnect, which Lewis addresses in fascinating detail, is how it's taken so long for those managing the teams to put all of this raw data to use.    So much of the spirit of baseball is romance, intuition and emotion. But these days the stakes are too high with many millions invested in a team to compete without every edge available at your disposal. Billy Beane and the A's have forever changed the game of baseball, and it's great to read about when and how the revolution started.    A true investigator, Lewis also recognizes the weaknesses of Beane's breakthrough approach to baseball and how, even though it may greatly increase the odds for a winning season, the strategy comes somewhat unraveled at playoff time.

The grace in the movie is that the story is much better than the acting of O'Neal.  It is a shame that Liam Neeson was not old enough at the time to portray Barry Lyndon: everything else in the movie is great, but O'Neal's disinterested acting makes it a toss-up between comic and dramatic...especially the part when he \\"beats up\\" on a much heavier and savvy soldier in a bare-knuckled fight.  \\"Might-en I be allowed to keep my horse?\\"  Keep the horse, and spare us the acting.

I have read reviews comparing this book to other books set in Russia, but Child 44 stands alone. I don't usually care for books set in foreign countries with all the difficult names of people and places, but I did not have that problem with this book. Not overly complex nor \\"dumbed down\\", it was perfectly written. The characters were well-developed to the point where I cared about what happened to them, and the story moved along at a brisk pace. There were several times while reading the book that I said \\"wow\\" or \\"omg\\" out loud. I felt like I learned something about the harshness and cruelty of Soviet life in the 1950's and at the same time I was thoroughly entertained by this novel. And realizing that this was Tom Rob Smith's first novel made it that much more fascinating to me. It seemed like it was written by a seasoned professional in his prime. I am in awe of this novel and its author. Hopefully T R Smith will do a book tour in the US somewhere near me so I can meet him. Simply brilliant.

B000YD7S2Q|5.0|Wagner's 1850 vision of rapturous stillness, the ecstasy of love and of the strange and terrible beauty that is barely discernable in the eternal silence that rounds our lives, has often been one of the most difficult of his operas to stage. Rudolph Kempe's brilliant 1964 recording on EMI is still the finest recorded version available of this deeply mystical work. Wagner perfected the technique of sonically weaving a cosmic stage upon which human passions play out in his later masterpieces, especially Tristan and Parsifal, but Lohengrin is the headwater of much of his greatest later artistry.<br /><br />Film director Werner Herzog staged this production under the watchful eye of Bayreuther Festspiele artistic director (and Wagner grandson), Wolfgang Wagner. Herzog was given his marching orders: this production must stay in the repertoire a minimum of five years - \\"so no trendy antics.\\" By blending the most modern and up-to-date theater technology: smoke, lasers, film back projection, with a deeply traditional stage production, Herzog has essentially created a late 20th century version of a 19th century picture-book world that romantically recreates the primitive 10th century northern-European setting. Nothing exemplifies this more than Lohengrin's sudden, heroic swan-borne entrance through a scrim of laser light and smoke. The effect is electrifying as it is perfectly timed to Wagner's powerful music. Moments such as these work brilliantly in combination with the magnificent sound and exemplary performance of the Bayreuther Festspiele. This time travel telescoping of three temporal sensibilities, crisply focuses (into a slightly more Earthbound vision) Wagner's occasional over-reaching for mythic effects, the very thing that makes his operas so difficult to stage coherently. That is one of this production's greatest strengths, and is well worth a recommendation for that fact alone.<br /><br />The cast stars Paul Frey as Lohengrin, Manfred Schenk as King Henry the Fowler, and Cheryl Studer as Elsa von Brabant. The orchestra is conducted by Peter Schneider. Their performances are superb, heightened by Bayreuth's absolutely resplendant acoustics. Every note bursts from the stage with a warmth and clarity fostered by the now 150 year old wood from which the stage is constructed. The orchestra, which plays from beneath the covered pit, is similarly rewarded: Wagner's brilliant writing for the brasses is given a warmth and reverberant fullness of tone that is slightly recessed and softened by the wood covering. Unique in the opera world, Bayreuth's stunning acoustics provides an aura of distance, increasing the other-worldly quality of Wagner's music, an effect that is perfect for his operas.<br /><br />Brilliantly directed by Brian Large, the DVD was filmed in June 1990 and looks crystal clear in this remastered version that runs for 214 minutes. The sound in both PCM stereo and DTS 5.1 is full, rich and life-like. There are the usual DGG menus and translations. A booklet is enclosed.<br /><br />A blend of traditional staging with new technology, all in the service of a splendid artistic conception, makes this Lohengrin a fine investment for fans of this opera. Most strongly recommended.<br /><br />Mike Birmanl Studer as Elsa von Brabant. The orchestra is conducted by Peter Schneider.

B00005S6K8|4.0|Other than the fact that it seemed like Linus and Sabrina fell in love  quickly (two-three days?) I found this to be a charming remaking.  The first act seemed or felt rather long-watching her in Paris while she slowly tried to forget about David.  I did wonder whatever happened to her photographer boyfriend-but I guess he was just meant to be a fling.  Plus, I would have liked this modernized version to give her father more of a backbone other than just letting whatever happen-happen.  Plus, Sabrina was supposed to be like this innocent breath of fresh air-chick who was steadily pursuing an engaged man.  I questioned her intelligence to willing line up to be one of those love him and dump chicks David ran through.  If she knew him as well as she said she did, why follow his blueprint to a broken heart?  Still it's a charming film-a good remake-not great-but good.

0618001905|5.0|Hochschild's treatment of Belgian King Leopold's African Empire is a well-written and authoritative lay history.  The author provides a context for and then delves deeply into the period lasting decades (from the 1880s into the 1920s) during which the envious crowned head of a tiny European nation built himself a totalitarian state for his personal financial gain in the heart of a continent suffering wholesale rape at the gunpoints of the world powers of the time.<br /><br />Hochschild is careful to note that although the scale of the killings of Congolese Africans was \\"of genocidal proportions,\\" maybe ten million, it wasn't genocide.  It was business.  He also notes that King Leopold wasn't the only villain during this time; French, British and U.S. imperialists were oppressing and taking advantage of people throughout Africa, Asia and the Pacific.  He does, however, show that the study of Leopold's exercise is an excellent, egregious example of the spirit of the times.  And the contest against Leopold's Congolese nation by some of the great humanitarians of the early twentieth century gave voice to the first internationalist ways of thinking about human rights, and local African sovereignty.  There were many great, flawed, powerful, conflicted personalities involved in the struggle to make the world aware of what Leopold was doing in the African interior such as British businessman E.D. Morel, U.S. adventurer/attorney George Washington Williams, Irish idealist Roger Casement, and American clergyman William Sheppard.  Finally, Hochschild observes that the current condition of many African countries can't be laid fully to rest on the grave of the despotic Leopold, or on imperialism itself.  But it is important to recognize and truthfully account for the parts that Western selfishness and superiority played in the history of \\"the Dark Continent.\\"<br /><br />I read this book upon the recommendation of my girlfriend and subsequent to a whirlwind college course in which the European colonial period of the African continent was given a mere week in a history class I was taking.lonial period of the African continent was given a mere week in a history class I was taking.

B0011NVC9I|4.0|There has been much said of this version of the classic tale. While not entirely faithful, this version is flat-out, a lot of fun! The last all CGI film I saw was the first \\"Final Fantasy\\". By being CGI enhanced, \\"Beowulf\\" actually works. There were scenes that would not have worked without it. The performances were what you would expect of talent such as Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich, Brendan Gleeson, Angelina Jolie and Crispin Glover. Crispin Glover? Yes! Lets just say that it's a toss-up as to whether he looks better as his characterization or in real life (but in either case, he's STILL creepy!)!    The only other peer this film might have is \\"The 13th Warrior\\", but in either case, entertainment value is high, in my humble opinion.  The DVD comes with an abundance of special features, which \\"flesh-out\\" all aspects of the film's production.  Let's just say that \\"Beowulf\\" isn't perfect, but it's close. A very good entertainment value.
0061565571|3.0|Although this novel by Carlos Ruiz Zafon was intended for a younger audience, the simple intrigue and characters can also interest older readers.  The language is vivid and, although there is not much actual character development, the \\"personajes\\" are clear and fitting for the plot.
B0002IQEHI|2.0|While I agree that this is a very sleek looking film and there is something appealing about being mistaken for a spy-I really felt as if the plot is nothing more than a series on convenient incidences.  I'm sure that this was cutting edge material for a film in 1959, it just strikes me as silly now.  But from the silly idea of let's liquor him up and drive him off a cliff to a crop dusting plane plowing into gas truck, I honestly couldn't stop rolling my eyes to the back of my head.  And I absolutely wasn't feeling the abrupt ending. I love you Hitchcock and Cary Grant, but this one wasn't for me.

B000WTBMBK|3.0|I know this album is getting all these great reviews and people with really great taste can't get enough of it, but I don't get it!  Yes, the first track is amazing, but the entire rest of the album sounds nearly exactly the same. In fact, the first time I played it I thought, \\"Wow, what a long song,\\" only to find out that I was already on track 6! I am sure there are subtleties that I am missing, but I think this should have been sold as an EP, or as a EP of remixes, since they all do sound like the same song. I would love for someone to show me the error of my thought processing on this one, how could so many of you be wrong?
055358894X|3.0|Entertaining plot, reasonably amusing characters, but painfully cookie cutter - felt as if it was written using the character classes from a D&D game: \\"Hey, we've got a rogue, a wizard, a fighter, and a cleric!  That's a great party!\\"    Writing is decent but nothing special; a bit *too* clever at times, as other reviewers have pointed out but no jarringly awful prose.  Comparisons to China Mieville are totally misguided: Mieville approaches writing as if he is trying to create great literature or at least transcend the bounds of genre fiction.  Think more along the lines of Glen Cook's Garrett novels or Matthew Reilly's \\"Scarecrow\\" series, but I think Cook and Reilly take themselves less seriously.    Would I recommend this book?  Well, I gave it three stars...readable but not something particularly worth seeking out.

0761925538|5.0|I read this book to help me understand how to conduct case studies for a project I was doing, that eventually turned into a book. I did a pretty good canvas of other books about case study research and was impressed with the other reviews here on Amazon, and ended up buying this book as a result.<br /><br />I used the advice from the book about preparing consistent questions and following a protocall throughout my research. This helped when I had to ask some pointed questions of some interviewees, if only to be consistent across the board. This work is accessible even to non-academics, who wish to use this research method to gather information for non profit research. For me, the case study research for my project became the most statisfying part. In the end the case studies made the manuscript into something more valuable to the reader and therefore publishable.

B00005NTJK|5.0|I had never heard this album before, but Jethro Tull is favorite artist so I knew I would like it. Thick as a Brick, Aqualung, and Songs From the Wood are all really awesome albums, but I'd have to say this is about my favorite. 5 stars all day.

B000654YS8|5.0|Great collection of classic videos.  Interesting study of MTV evolution as well.  Started with concert like video of the band playing Sultans, then goes more into story line videos, including the classic Money For Nothing digital thing (Walk of Life and Calling Elvis are also classics that my kids still appreciate), and ultimately leads back to the concert recordings that are in the On The Night DVD.  If you are a Knopfler or Dire Straits fan you need to own this one.  I have showed it to friends on my IPOD and they all chuckle with the memories they bring.

This book holds a very tender place in our hearts.

0060935464|5.0|Title: To Kill A Mocking Bird  Publisher: Warner Books   Author: Harper E. Lee  Date: 1960   Reading Level: 8th Grade Reading Level   Number of Pages: 281 Pages   Genre: Fiction         To Kill a Mocking Bird by Harper E. Lee deals with issues such as, racism, innocence and empathy. Scout Finch and her brother Jem live in a small town in Alabama where they become obsessed with Boo Radley. Boo leaves present under a tree that Scout and Finch continue to visit until Boo's brother fills the hole with cement. At the same time as this story develops Attacus Finch (Scout's father) decided to defend Tom Robinson who is a black man who is accused of raping a white female. Racial tensions then develop in the story.  Scout is then picked on at school and is forced to deal with racial issues at a young age. Tom Rabinson is later falsely convicted of the crime by an all white jury and tries to escape from jail and is shot dead. Later in the novel Tom Robinison's accuser is embarrassed because Attacus embarrasses him in the courtroom and harasses Jem and Scout when Boo comes to their rescue.    As a current teacher I firmly believe that this book should be read at the end of middle school. It is a fantastic novel that teachers young adults some very important lessons. It is a coming of age novel that provides very valuable lessons at a middle school age. The book provides characters that are very relatable and the reader develops strong feelings for the character. This is a book that should be read by people of all ages. This book is typically read by freshmen in high school, however, I strongly believe that this book can do a great amount of good if read at a middle school level. The books issues and themes are so prevalent to a middle school world. To see Jem and Scout grow up throughout the novel just as many young middle schoolers are.    The only negative aspect of this book for middle schoolers is that the characters in the beginning of the novel may be hard to relate to.Scout is too young and Atticus may be too old. However, I believe that the issues that are handled in the book are issues that typical teenagers care about. I have found that issues like racism always spark debate in the middle school classroom.  Another problem with this novel is that despite the 8th grade reading levels it deals with a complicated plot and takes in-depth analysis to fully understand all of its meaning which may make it hard for a middle schooler to fully comprehend.
B000LC55F2|1.0|That's the tagline -- \\"you want to be fooled\\". This movie is about two men obsessed with envy, and there's no moral to the movie whatsoever. The audience is left to draw their conclusion. But at the very end, there's tag line again... You want to be fooled. Well, you were. This wasn't entertaining. It was an exercise in debauchery. It paints a picture of the human race that is horrible -- we lie, have secrets, and are basically evil. We want to be fooled, and we'll subscribe to watching a movie that has no redeeming value, then at the end we're told that the joke was on us! Well, I want my money back! I found that insulting, and the movie repulsive.<br /><br />This movie should have been rated R. Children that are 13 years old might walk away from this with the wrong impression. It inspires trickery. It inspires debauchery. It illustrates how evil people can be. And at the very end it says \\"we took your money. You wanted to be fooled. See how good this works?\\"<br /><br />This is the second movie with Bale that I've seen that is just plain horrible. The other is that grotesque, made for the sake of showing violence, 3:10 to Yuma, wherein a man is killed with a fork(!), and there are no heros! If Bale doesn't make a movie with a postitive statement soon, I can only come to the conclusion that the man has no higher calling than to make a dollar and is willing to do ANYTHING to make that dollar, and then takes no responsibility for the impression he's leaving on the world! He's not in it to make the world better, and NOTHING has more power to reach so many people as movies. He's wasting our time with this kind of sick 'entertainment'.<br /><br />Mr. Bale, get a clue! You people who like this, think what your kid's might like! Perhaps the future has public executions in store for us if we condone this kind of 'entertainment' by allowing it to be rated PG13.
0385339100|5.0|It was my first John Grisham Novel and now he is my favorite author...I think that says it all about this novel! The only thing I didn't like about this story was the ending. I felt it just didn't reflect the character he portrayed all through the story. But I would still give it a 5 Star because it deserves it! Grisham I just wish you keep coming up with your appealing novels!
1881273156|5.0|My husband and I read this book on the advice of our marriage counselor. We'd been having trouble communicating and had both run out of patience not only with each other, but with our relationship. I think this book served as a great resource. It helped us to approach each other more thoughtfully and to have a better understanding of how and why we operate and react the way we do/have. Regardless of where you are in your life, be it happily married, dating, having marital problems etc., this book offers much needed guidance in managing your relationships with others - especially your partner. It is a quick read and totally worth the investment.
044024238X|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite of Kinsella's novels. The main character, Samantha Sweeting, is a top lawyer at the most prestigious lawfirm in London. Sure that this is what she's always wanted, she willingly sacrifices much of her basic life in order to remain on top. However, after a missed post-it causes her to lose her firm hundreds of thousands of pounds she takes off & finds herself in a quaint village where she's mistaken for a housekeeper. There she discovers that there's more to life than just work.<br /><br />While I have to admit that none of Kinsella's books will ever win an award for it's depth, you can't help but continuously enjoy her works. The character of Samantha is an incredibly appealing person & you can't help but like her. At times the plotline is a little farfetched, but again... you don't read Kinsella's stuff for it's realism & depth. Her books are what they are. I do have to agree with one reviewer though when they say that Kinsella seems to equate \\"hardworking\\" with \\"not fun\\" or \\"bad\\" in many of her novels. It would be refreshing to see a character who works hard, yet isn't feeling unfullfilled or worn out.<br /><br />Would I recommend this to a friend? I would, but only if they don't mind fluffy reading. Fans of Kinsella's other work or similarly themed things will love this book, but people who like their chick lit or women's fiction to have a bit more reality will be dissapointed.
0452287588|5.0|I haven't actually read the book.  I just wanted to be apart of the Oprah wave.  I'll be reading it while on vacation in a couple of weeks.  Otherwise, the book came in great condition and in a timely fashion.
B00011F5DK|5.0|My 10-year-old son asked for this for his birthday.  He wanted to play with it immediately, so in order to pacify him, a few of us adults agreed to play with him.  It didn't take long for us to see that this was not just a children's game.  We soon had other family members looking over our shoulders, giving suggestions and patiently waiting for their turn to play.  The only person who had difficulty with the game was a relative who is red-green color blind.  He is able to see slight variations to adequately play other games with colored tokens, but because this game requires frequent visual scanning of the array of colors, it was too much of an effort for him to enjoy the game like the rest of us.  Another word of caution is to keep track of all of the pieces (a feat for my family of 3 children).  My sister suggested tracing or photocopying the pieces to use as extras when we undoubtedly lose the plastic pieces in the future!

B00000DQSZ|5.0|i received this album as a birthday present 3 years ago.  its changed my life drastically since then... not just with music, but how i vision my existence as well.  it also changed my entire group of friend's lives too.  none of us have really been the same since this album (and this band) entered our lives.  i've listened to it sober, and i've listened to it altered.  either way, the album itself is a living, breathing entity.  trans europe express isn't just a brilliant lp, its a place to visit. from the opening trainride to germany on \\"europe endless\\" to the emotional drop of \\"endless endless\\", you feel like you've just went on vacation to a magical world of happy plastic flowers and scary baby jane movie stars... buy the ticket, take the ride.
B0014BECF8|5.0|Brought this american edition of the cd, already have the english, just for one track that is currently not available in th UK. 'Feeling Good' is perfect to show off George's vocal talent and range. Love the rest of the tracks too. Well worth a visit to see him on his 25 Live tour if you get a chance. We went 3 times and each night was as good as ever. Fans for life!!
B00008G9JM|3.0|I like the Passion Play. I wouldn't say it is the best Tull album. The funny thing is... Jethro Tull never gets any respect. They received a psuedo grammy for best Heavy Metal album \\"Crest of a Knave\\"<br /><br />Now Amazon has some techno dance beat crud for the listening samples.<br /><br />Other than that I would give Passion Play 5 stars if it weren't for the intermission. Not everything is timeless.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I set my goal for this year to loose 50 lbs. and I started my diet and workout plan a month and a half ago, I started working out on a stepper that I have at home until I saw this video for sale. I've had it for 3 weeks and I'm bearly on level 1 and I can see a big diference in my body already. I have lost 15 lbs. I can't wait to build up my endurance to do workout 2 then 3, which are all in the same video. I have to say that this is one of the thoughest 20 minute workouts that I've done in a long time and I have purchased several others believe me. Like Jillian says \\"If you want does abs you have to work at it\\".
B0013K6WLM|3.0|I've spent a lot of time sorting out my mixed feelings about this album, and I'm not sure if I've sorted them all out yet but I figured I'd give it a try.  In many ways it is too smooth, it lacks the grit, inconsistencies and heavy rifts that gave them a sound that was so intoxicating.  You could take any song, grab onto their brilliant rifts and let them take you for a ride that beat any roller coaster.  These are the type of songs that Patrick Carney produces so brilliantly, so I was hesitant when I heard Danger Mouse was producing.  While he does some good, even great stuff, a nice riff certainly isn't his thing.  I haven't changed my thinking.  Danger Mouse never let the riffs take over, he never gave them enough room to breathe.  \\"I Got Mine\\" is probably the biggest offender, since it seemed to aspire to be a song from a previous Keys album, but falling well short.  On Remember When (Side B) probably comes closest to mastering the rifts, but as good of as song it is, I feel Patrick would have handled it better.     On the other hand, there are some truly great songs on this album.  \\"Psychotic Girl\\" sounds far more like a Danger Mouse song than a TBK song, but I find it hard to deny its brilliance.  \\"Ocean and Streams\\" and \\"So He Won't Break\\" definitely have the Danger Mouse fingerprints, but manage to maintain much of the TBK spirit, leaving us with some really good songs.    The song I've found to be my favorite is \\"Things Ain't Like They Used to Be.\\"  From the opening record player crackle I knew I was getting something a little more raw than the rest of the album, and was rewarded with the kind of brilliant, pull at your heart strings ballad that many attempt, but only the greatest can pull off.    Overall I think I really like this album.  However, as someone that has heard every song The Black Keys have ever released (trust me, they don't make it easy for you to find everything), I'd put this towards the bottom of their pantheon.  I know they wanted to tryto expand their sound, and I think they did so far more brilliantly with \\"Rubber Factory.\\"  This album may have been better served with Danger Mouse and Patrick splitting producing duties, Pat on some of the more riff focused songs with DM taking over on the others.  I hope Patrick goes back to producing for the Keys after this, since he's proven to be the only one to fully harness the raw power and the energy that is The Black Keys.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|What can I say, it's a battery, but I guess even batteries have issues.  This one works great - I use it in my Canon 5d.
0810993139|3.0|Younger kids will love this, and anything that will get kids to read is great.<br /><br />As an adult who loves children's and YA lit, I found the book to be intermittently amusing but -pictures aside- don't think it breaks any new ground, either in storytelling or originality. Not that every book has to be a groundbreaker but for me, the story lacked a certain spark. I found the situations like the school play and the difficulty with the parents a bit hackneyed and rote.  But other parts of the book, like the giant snowball that tore up the sod in the lawn are perfect in capturing the trouble kids cause when they really don't mean it.<br /><br />For those who did enjoy this book, I recommend they graduate to Sherman Alexie's \\"Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian\\" that has a similar conceit (a diary with cartoons), but much more depth without sacrificing any of the enjoyment.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This show is incredible. I was blown away by the video, as well as by the unique footage and the exit interviews with the crew about how they shot all these scenes. Everyone should see this - the conservation shows are particularly thought-provoking. Also, I've heard that David Attenboro is a far better narrator than Sigourney Weaver or whoever Americans got to narrate it.
160459201X|5.0|I've always been a big believer that your life is what you create with your thoughts. Changing your thoughts consistently over time will of course change your life. It sounds simple, and it is, if you continue to be aware of your thoughts and dismiss or let go of negative thinking or fears. The techniques outlined in this book are easily performed and very straightforward -- and give steps to re-train negative thinking into postive outcomes.  This is a wonderful resource on ways to change your life for the better. Elaine Williams

B000TGJ8AS|5.0|This is such a great show.  It does not assume that war and violence are  the answer.  The NCIS team if tough and compassionate.  The characters have interesting faults.  the humor is wonderful.      I would recommend NCIS to anyone.  This show gets better as the seasons go on.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I love to cook and am a child-at-heart who loved this movie about a rat chef. The story is sweet, and in typical pixar style, it is excellently well-made. I completely recommend this movie to pretty much anyone.
B0013FBS20|4.0|Great acting from Will Smith! The movie itself was a bit short and I thinks that producers could've done a better job in developing more this theme. That's thereason I don't give it a 5 stars.  In a nut-shell, Anything that has Will Smith on so far has been very entretaining!
B0011UGLK6|5.0|After I finished reading this book, I didn't want to read anything else for a while.  It was that good; I read it in a day. Her writing is infectious.  While I thoroughly enjoyed the whole thing, I think that she outdoes herself in Part Two of the book, where she tells essentially the same story from the points of view of two people, Hema and Kaushik. One reviewer commented on the melodramatic aspect of her writing and while I admit that it seems she does go a bit heavy on it in this collection, it's what she does well and it works. I find the sameness and familiarity with which she writes comforting.  With a Jhumpa Lahiri book, one always knows what one is going to get and that is what, in my opinion, makes her books so great.
B000WCBPBO|1.0|This ain't a great soundtrack in general to begin with, so it's made worse when the best track, \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" by Sheryl Crow is one of the \\"Album Only\\" purchases. It's obvious that the soundtrack can't stand on its own--they know that people will only want to buy a couple of the songs so they make them \\"Album Only\\" purchases. I don't like it one bit and I *won't* be buying the album even if it means I don't get the song I want. Please change it, Amazon!
0783219695|3.0|Apollo 13 is a good Ron Howard film, I just don't think it's his most accomplished work. Tom Hanks pulls off another excellent performance, the problem I have with this film is the pacing, it's slow but the ending more than makes up for it. Apollo 13 is a film every young adult should watch, good history lesson.
0316067601|5.0|Marcus Luttrell writes a powerful book that shows the hardship of training, the perfection of the SEAL, and the courage of men.    Marcus is one of the participants of Operation Redwing where nineteen special forces members died in one day. I remember the news stories back when I was in college. I remember seeing Michael Murphy's photo on television. Murphy is probably my idea of how a SEAL should look like; cool, calm, and incredibly fit. I felt a sort of sadness come over me when I saw Murphy's photo on television. Some time later, I heard Murphy got the Medal Of Honor and I knew from the get go after seeing a picture of this man, that he must of died heroically and probably behaved like how a true SEAL should to the end.    Now I have the chance to read over the story about Operation Redwing. I was more interested in hearing what Murphy did that day, but then I found that Marcus did a wonderful job explaining the whole thing; from training to how he survived the slaughter.    I won't go into much details about the story since I think most people will know the entire story. The one important lesson I learned about the training was take it one minute at a time, don't think about the future or how you will perform in the future; think about right now. I think this is an important life lesson that can be used outside of physical training and into everyday life.     By the end of the story I was a bit sad. Marcus was rescued by villagers in the Afghan mountains and these people protected Marcus with their life. Not only that, they took the time to insure that Marcus would be rescued and that the Taliban didn't have the last shot. I was a bit sad that to hear about the village children and how the Taliban abused the children while they tried to gather things for Marcus. I was also surprised by how people gathered around Marcus's parents and family. I think it goes to show that even though the media might make it seem like everyone is against the current war in the Middle East, people still care about friends and families. I think it goes to show that America is a great country and its citizens care about others just as much as they care about themselves.    Overall, I am happy with the book. I am sad of the fact how we lost so many young people, but I think the key thing about this book is that there are good people out there who are willing to lend you a hand when you're down. I heard another good book is Bravo Two Zero. I am planning to read that book in the future.
B000ETQPYM|5.0|This book was hilarious! I could read it again and again! Holly's friends make you laugh and cry and ultimately helps Holly live through the next 10 months. She is able to pick up the pieces and still live with a contentment that Gerry would have wanted her to have. She finds out that her family means everything to her, and along the way she finds out who her true friends really are as well. If anyone has suffered from losing someone this book makes you find the good in what is yet to come. It is not over and Cecelia Ahern shows exactly how this is true by creating this novel. She is a wonderful author, and I would recommend this book to anyone!
B0015D3Z4O|3.0|I'm a huge fan but am disappointed in this CD in that it must have taken her a couple hours in the studio to record this.  Everything else was left to studio \\"wizards\\".  It is way over-produced.  And based on her MSN Hard Candy concert, she can't sing the basic melodies of the songs.  That said, I like about half the tracks on this CD.  \\"Give It To Me\\" and \\"Beat Goes On\\" are standouts for me.  But most sound like Confessions on the Dance Floor rejects.  Again, huge fan but I was expecting more from her.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This dvd is hard core...I love it! It's a great workout. I really like the circuit training and different levels of intensity.

I already can see a difference!
B000PKG6TE|5.0|I absolutely give this 5 stars. I love this album. I was in love with it the first time I heard it, and it only seems to keep getting better.<br /><br />There are hints of Era Vulgaris that show up on Lullabies To Paralyze (2005), so if there is a change in direction and sound that caught some or many by surprise, it was already leaned towards 3 years ago.  I kind of think this is QOTSA's album equivalent to David Bowie's LOW (1976). It would seem imminent that QOTSA next work with Brian Eno, Robert Fripp or somebody of that ilk based on the things happening within Era Vulgaris.<br /><br />There's always been for me, something sinister afoot in QOTSA's music. Josh Homme's voice and vocal delivery has always reminded me of Ben Orr in The Cars, and when I hear certain songs from QOTSA (especially \\"I'm Designer\\") I think 'this is Ric Ocasek when he's almost overdosed'. If no one likes The Cars here, that's okay, or thinks it's a bad comparison.  I've always thought of QOTSA as The Cars on really good bad drugs. Probably why I love this band so much and what they do, no matter who is in it. 'They' convinced me Dave Grohl should quit Foo Fighters and go back to playing drums. ;)<br /><br />My wife thinks \\"Turning On The Screw\\" is one of the most annoying things she's ever heard. I'm absolutely enthralled by the song. It's that panning left to right action on the guitars during the 'solo section'(?). Whatever that section is QOTSA called it in the studio. Bridge Maximus 76 or whatever. Apparently it's none too popular with listeners to this album based on reviews I've read. I loved it. \\"Sick Sick Sick\\" is irresistible, it's just something QOTSA are so good at. I could go song by song of course. I love that it takes over a 1 minute 30 secs to finally hear a vocal in \\"Misfit Love\\" and that that main riff is hammered down into the ground until the end opens up. \\"Suture Up My Future\\" I listened to non-stop for weeks. It was just absolutely my favourite song from this album for the longest time.<br /><br />Really this review is a bunch of nonsense. Everytime I go to write something about Era Vulgaris (and I've tried 3 times and cancelled the review) I never say enough or have too much to say. No in-betweens. That I've gotten this far in the review is a miracle, cuz I'm already reading it back and thinking, \\"you didn't mention much about the guitar tones and the overall strange sounds you hear on this album\\". Wait. I just did kinda. It's QOTSA's LOW/HEROES and LODGER. I can only hope they get more weird and strange and innovative, because that sinister 'thing' in QOTSA's music is only served by these disturbing and peculiar sounds that are showing up all over Era Vulgaris. It's really like Musique Concrete of the Stone Age.Really this review is a bunch of nonsense.

0061122416|2.0|I had heard that this book was a really good read, but I had to struggle through it.  It's translated into English so that makes it a little more difficult to read.  It was a little more black and white that I was expecting.  I felt this, this happened...things like that.  Not pondering really and why things were the way they were.  I would not read it again and I wouldn't lend it out to anyone telling them it is worth their time.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|One of the best true-story films ever made, Sergeant York, gets America ready for sacrifice as the Axis rolls against the democracies in 1941. Gary Cooper brings York to life, a Tennessee Hillbilly with a drinkin' problem. Coop is probably too old to play a very young man in 41, but his acting style, the American Everyman pulls it off. He's a hayseed, but he's our hayseed. As York stumbles in poverty, as he betters himself, working hard, striving for good bottom land, there's dissapointments. Luckily, he falls for a fine country gal, he has the support of his ma and siblings, and then there's Walter Brennan as his spiritual advisor.    Coop gets religion and is a mind that war and killing is wrong. WW1 happens and even in Danial Boone country, men are drafted. Our anti-war fellow goes reluctantly, learns a little American history, balances liberty with warfare, and the rest is history.    Few films actually make me blubber like a girl, but SY does it again and again. That last scene with his girl at the bottom land farm, that broke me for hours.
B000P0J074|5.0|If you like BeetleJuice and the supernatural then buy this movie you won't be let down.  This is a very good movie fun for all ages.  See this movie is what started the cartoon series on cartoonnetwork in the early 1990's BeetleJuice.  Personally I think Micheal Keaton did a fantastic job as playing BeetleJuice I just really like this movie alot it talk's about what the after life is like basically see Barbara and Adam Maitland die and their ghost's in the movie and they meet BeetleJuice and I'm not going to tell you the rest because you have to watch the movie trust me this movie is really good it will make you want to say BeetleJuice three times.
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|Back in 2005 I didn't give this album the listens it deserved. I had a lot of stuff going on, including the birth of my son. There was also the departure of Nick Oliveri, and in seeing such a 'high profile' member of the band leaving so soon after the success and attention \\"No One Knows\\" brought Queens of the Stone Age, just gave me warning signs. Another 'o here we go, success starts spilling in, the rats start jumping ship' mentality, and then you just have a band that just isn't as good, or the same as it once was. Missing the elements that got them there to your attenton in the first place. It's a bad mentality to have. It brings a pre-judgement of the work contained therein, and doesn't allow the piece to take a shape and form of its own. The departure of Oliveri surely affected Homme's songwriting. It shouldn't affect the way you listen to what he's done. But, alas, we are all subjective creatures and blah blah blah.<br /><br />So after a month of celebrating 20 years of King's X by loading my mp3 player with only King's X and their solo projects material, and listening to nothing but them, when it came time to stop celebrating I decided to next fill up the Hitachi with only Queens of the Stone Age. And Queens of the Stone Age only. No Mondo Generator, no Kyuss, no Eagles of Death Metal. Nothing but QOTSA.<br /><br />This is when I finally really 'heard' Lullabies To Paralyze (in its entirety and in pieces). And when heard in comparison to QOTSA's other albums, I finally realised how great this album is, and deserves 5 stars through and through. I personally think everyone should wait 1 to 3 years before they review an album. :) Don't let me tell you what to do though. It's just that if after a year or two you're still listening to that album and still noticing new things in it, then that's a hallmark of a great album. Everything's so damn temporary these days, ya know? Let it sink in a bit.<br /><br />And based on \\"Precious & Grace\\" if QOTSA strolled up on stage and announced 'The ZZ Top you once knew is gone. We are now ZZ Top.', I do not think they would get any argument from me. They could be ZZ Top if they wanted to. ;)<br /><br />This album is brilliant. And there's things on here when you listen to the album very closely followed by tracks from Era Vulgaris (2007) that say QOTSA was heading towards Era Vulgaris in sound and design anyway. \\"Skin on Skin\\" and \\"Broken Box\\" could easily be Vulgaris songs. But truly there's so many influences and things going into what makes a QOTSA album what it is, it doesn't matter where they're heading or where they've been . It's all good. And I'm not in the know to say that Homme is the main songwriter for all things QOTSA. He may be just very generous when it comes down to songwriting credits (but I think drummers should get credit for song composition too. I don't see why not). He may just be a genius at selecting musicians to work with. Whatever it is that Homme is responsible for, as a songwriter myself, I'm slightly envious. Because he just comes up with songs you wish you wrote. A lot of QOTSA's material utilises the same design, beat that riff down into the ground, but you absolutely love them for doing it. It's incessant. Unrelenting. It's very cool. You hear shades of 70's classic rock, glam, punk, new wave, heavy metal all in there, but it's all kind of disturbed and ominous. Yea. QOTSA are kind of ominous. Slightly twisted up.<br /><br />So I was hearing a lot of these songs really for the first time in the past month. I just didn't head towards Lullabies as often as Deaf, Vulgaris and Rated R. ('QOTSA the first' kind of escaped some listens as well.) When I was ripping MP3's to my PC a few years ago, only \\"Tangled Up In Plaid\\" made it the library cavalcade. Other QOTSA albums were ripped a plenty. Lullabies was gently ignored. But that's cool. I'm listening to it non-stop now. QOTSA got their money from me at the time, and here I am reviewing it now hoping that what Isay get's them some more money somehow.<br /><br />Did I say how great this album is? \\"Everybody Knows That You're Insane\\". I can't stop listening to this song. Once I finally heard it, I kicked myself for ignoring it in the first place. But I'm listening now. I can't help thinking of The Partridge Family when hearing \\"Broken Box\\". It just somehow brings me to 70's bubblegum music, but yet the whole song is this fuzzed out, contemptuous (of whomever the lyrics may be about) piece of distorted something or other. It's like a Willy Wonka Golden Ticket found in an alleyway on the wrong side of town at the right time of night for bad things. (The Ominous of the Stone Age). \\"Skin On Skin' is just nasty. It's a dirty song. It's all shadows and bad neon lighting. It's a seedy dive. It's great! Liquid decadence. Don't know why I wrote that in relation to the song, but it sounded right.<br /><br />Surely \\"In My Head\\" will turn up on the inevitable The Greatest Hits of the Queens of the Stone Age's Greatest Hits collection one day. It bears the hallmark of what makes the QOTSA 'format' so ... QOTSA. And when I say format I don't mean it's just 'manufactured' or a thing Homme and Co. says, let's just do a song like that one again but change the lyric or the key. I just mean they do this thing, and you know they did it before, but you don't care. Because elements of the song stick out so much that its difference from another is so noticeable that any comparison seems moot. I just think Homme and who he works with and what comes out, is great songwriting. I think it's magical. I think there's so much talent and creativity associated with QOTSA that to not see it seems .... stupid! I think they (those associated) have contributed to one of the best bands of the last 20 years. And if Homme is responsible for that, then let it be so.<br /><br />Sometimes I think this might be the best of the QOTSA albums. I don't know why. It's really turning into a favourite. But then I really like the direction Era Vulgaris has gone. (In my Era Vulgaris review I compared it to QOTSA's equivalent of David Bowie's LOW, and the direction he pursued for the latter half of the 70's working with Brian Eno & Robert Fripp). Maybe Lullabies is like a closing chapter on a certain phase of QOTSA's career, and Vulgaris is going into different territory. Don't know. Too early to tell. But I know Skin On Skin and Broken Box said to listeners what Era Vulgaris might sound like..     Did I say how great this album is? \\"Everybody Knows That You're Insane\\".

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I LOVE this movie. I love everything about it, the music, the actors and actresses, the scene, the story line...Since I bought it I watched it every other day. I can relate to the main characters so much. I like the fact that so many lines are kept what Jane Austen used in the book. Keira is the perfect Ms. Bennet, and Matthew is the perfect Mr. Darcy. He is so handsome in this movie! I am not a romantic person, but this movie just amazing.
B000YJA660|5.0|I definetely recommend this book to everybody. You'll read this book many times and you'll be more enlightened each time.
0978606310|5.0|The pictures in this book are terrific. They are full color and quite detailed.  I especially like that Dream Beauties, petites and little litters are included.  Accessories are listed but not always shown but it's a wealth of information.  I am really enjoying reading it.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|I love Persuasion--it's one of my favorite of Jane Austen's.  So I was looking forward to this version since I'm not a huge fan of the Amanda Root version.      But is it too much to ask that they try to follow Jane Austen's story line?  Since it holds together?  I was going along with it until the end when I realized there's no motivation for how the characters are acting.  Because they didn't follow the story line--misplacing conversations and events.      If you aren't a huge Persuasion fan and you are a fan of costume drama, this might work for you.  But if you love the book, don't get your hopes up.  And go watch Pride and Prejudice.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|Thank you for your time.<br /><br />I could go on and on and babble forever in an attempt to prove to you how much I know about music and Portishead.  It isn't needed here.<br /><br />If you are a true Portishead believer you will find this album to be absolutely filthy.  It is filthy and dreary and in that way it is sensual, powerful and free.  It is simple and complex. It is naked and shrouded in enigma.  It is human.<br /><br />If you are not a believer, or if you are new and willing, this album will become welcome like the beautiful side of a reluctant addiction to pain medication.<br /><br />I challenge you to respect it.<br /><br />All hail this great time of change!<br /><br />PEACE!
B000VZUWZW|5.0|Being a mechanical engineering major myself and already having taken the requisite physics classes, it is a sheer delight to watch a show that can tell jokes which mock the number of dimensions required in String Theory or the absurd inaccuracies portrayed in sci-fi movies (Superman decelerating Lois Lane in a matter of a few feet from over 100 mph.  Although Sheldon was wrong about the number of pieces she would be cut into...).  I was hooked from the beginning when Sheldon called Penny's messy apartment a \\"swirling vortex of entropy.\\"  I just wish I could petition the show to use my quantum diffraction joke, it's a riot.    A word to those who claim the show misuses scientific jargon.  I've found that the uses of technical jargon are, for the most part, correct and they should be; the technical consultant for the show is UCLA physicist David Saltzberg.
B00026WU82|4.0|It is that kind o cd which values the price based in a single song
B0018CAAN6|1.0|This album is such a disappointment! I'm a big Madonna fan... .And I gotta say - most of the tracks on her new album \\"Hard Candy\\" are simply unlistenable to me. I tried listening to it several times, but I can't even bring myself to finish songs like \\"Candy Shop\\", \\"Give it to me\\", \\"Incredible\\", \\"Spanish Lesson\\". So, so bad... Her voice sounds the same on all of these songs...It becomes very annoying very fast. I don't even think she changes the key. The production sounds so dated, I heard all that so many times before. Too many times...The lyrics for the most part are terrible. I feel so embarrassed for her... The only two decent songs I found on the whole album are \\"Beat Goes On\\" and \\"Voices\\", which is the last song, and even though it's not a masterpiece, after listening to 11 tracks of mostly trash, it felt like a breath of fresh air. That's the only song on the whole album where you can hear something resembling good old Madonna... It has a nice ,pretty melody and not so bad lyrics. So what happened there? \\"American Life\\" used to be her worst album until now. Well the record is now broken (at least for me). \\"American Life\\" was at least authentic. It was Madonna. Not at her best, but it was her. \\"Hard Candy\\" is simply a bunch of over-used, over-rated R&B artists and producers feat. Madonna...

B000UR9T7I|2.0|The first two Spidey films rank among comic book films' best efforts.  Unfortunately, the third film suffers the same fate as every other \\"third\\" super hero movie (and for that matter almost every trilogy - third film therein - ever made) - poor story, writing, direction and sub-poar performances.    The hd quality of this disk is magnificant and is great to watch on a big tv with surround sound.    Let's hope they make a fourth (with a new creative team) and we see Spidey actually capture Sandman (like in separate story at the beginning - think James Bond type of films), fight Kraven on his honeymoon in the jungle (think Al Swarengen/Ian McShane as Kraven - how great would that be?) and maybe the Lizard as well.    Now that would be a cool fourth film.  Time to leave NY and set the adventure elsewhere with new writers, directors, and the like.

0553582038|2.0|Thus Martin wrote what is universally considered the worst sentence of his career.  This book is simply not the equal of the earlier books in the series in any way, shape, or form.  Things that Martin has pulled off successfully in the past, like dark, brooding, or even wholeheartedly evil characters like the Clegane brothers, totally flop in this book (see quote above).  The problem is much more than a simple shift of POV away from the remaining major characters from the previous books.  We needed a story arc in Dorne.  Dorne is an essential part of the backstory, and we are given some more hints on how Viserys and Dany were kept alive after Robert's Rebellion.  But the travails of Arianne Martell, Arys Oakheart, and Darkstar Dayne fail to live up to past standards.  Well, Arianne's use of sex to manipulate Arys, a \\"celibate\\" member of the Kingsguard, is classic Martin, but it goes downhill from there.  The plot device Martin uses to create the wedge between Arianne and her father, the Lord Paramount of Dorne, is embarassingly sophomoric; she finds a letter he had written to her brother when she was very young.  In the previous books when characters did something stupid and self destructive, I believed it.  This was Martin's essential gift as a storyteller.  When Arienne goes off on her little quest with Aerys and Darkstar, I just don't believe it.  Maybe if Arienne were 13. (She's 23 IIRC.)<br />The jolonquar prophecy was another sophomoric plot device intended to explain Cersei's paranoia.  It should have been cut out completely.  Cersei still resents not getting to marry Rhaegar as her father had intended, and resents getting married to a womanizing wife beater.  She's also been frakking her twin brother since she was 12 years old.  We understand Cersei without a fortune telling subplot to explain her.  That's why this story isn't one star - there's still worthwhile material.not getting to marry Rhaegar as her father had intended, and resents getting married to a womanizing wife beater.  Then there's the fact she's been frakking her twin brother since she was 12 years old.  We understand Cersei being screwed up, we don't need a fortune telling subplot to explain it.  There is some good content here as we see her vie with Margaery Tyrell for the personal loyalty of Tommen, Cersei's son, and see Cersei turn over former allies who become inconvenient to Qyburnstein, a delicious side character.       Jaime's POV is the only long POV whose length feels justified.  We get to see him make an honest struggle to keep the oaths he has sworn and come to terms with the truth that his sister is a lying whore and has been a dreadful influence on his life.  I loved the psychotherapy sessions with a mute character who Jaime is using to learn to fight with his left hand.  It's amazing how well you can communicate when words can't get in the way.    Arya and Sansa's POV were good yet brief.  Arya begins to lose her identity, warging into tomcats in her dreams instead of Nymeria.    Martin does a great job of truly putting us in Sansa's POV.  Littlefinger doesn't explicitly tell her that he's deliberately trying to poison little Lord Robert Arryn, the Lord Paramount of the Vale, he just has the doctor give him sweetsleep to help with his conniption fits.  The reader is put in the same position as Sansa in being expected to realize what's happening.  Sansa's willful ignorance has led her to commit treason in the past, how will this turn out?  I wouldn't bet either way.  If Robert dies, Sansa's position in the Game of Thrones is advanced considerably.  It's also morbidly fascinating that Littlefinger can't decide whether he wants to treat Sansa as his own child or get into her pants.  She's the beautiful daughter of the only woman he ever loved, and could never hope to have.  I almost forgot about Sam's story arc.  Necessary but overlong.  Read the prologueand the last chapter and you'll see what the real point of the whole thing was.  The fact that I haven't thought of anything to say about the Iron Islands story arc speaks for itself.  It's so-so and I have no particular opinion one way or the other on it.  I will say that I don't think Euron's dragon horn is going to work the way he expects.  That it will get a dragon's attention I have no doubt - it's loud enough to wake the dead.  But operate as a dragon mind control device?  I wouldn't bet the Seastone Chair on it.
0452289963|4.0|I ordered this book to use as an example of Modern New Age philosophy in a church group that I lead and I rated this book highly because it is a great example of that religion. I am a born again Christian who believes Christ is the only way to salvation therefore anyone who disagrees with that should stop reading now........ Ok fellow believers, this book is an excellent example of Modern New Age thinking that clouds the understanding of who we are and who God is. In the first chapter the author denies the validity of the Bible by saying that \\"Man created God in his own image...\\" Although the point of the passage was not to deny God Himself (that would be too obvious) he reasoned that God is bigger than how man can describe Him in a book and therefore the Bible is man's early understanding of God and not God's revelation to man. This thought is further built by the constant reference to evolution as a result of our \\"awakening\\" to the \\"truth\\" that is in us all and we must \\"evolve or die\\". I am still reading this book, but I can't recommend it enough for those of you who would be studying this genre of religion or thinking of teaching a study on the Modern New Age movement in America. I would not recommend this book to anyone who is weak in their faith because this is spiritual warfare on a global scale. I understand some non-believers have probably read this far and God bless you. I hope and pray that you would investigate the other side of this eternal debate by reading Mark Driscoll or Donald Miller. Peace+Love
B000OONQBM|5.0|Have you ever seen a movie years (decades) ago and you loved it then? Over the years the movie in your heart and mind gets even better through your memory. Then when you re-watch it years later, it's so blown out of proportion through your memory that you're let down. Not so with The Warriors. This movie is just as good as ever. The atmosphere of the movie is great. The story of survival is great. The old-school gangs are done very well. At just over an hour and a half, it's a good pick to watch when one is pressed for time. I highly recommend The Warriors. It was good in 1979 and it's still good in 2008.

B000GX57YK|3.0|Never before in the annals of product placement, not with Disney's Love Bug or Bond's Aston Martin has a car so thoroughly captured the imagination of its producer and director.<br />Beginning as three ordinary, if zippy and sassy little urban go-mobiles, the  brave little Minis are transformed into brawny, high-powered brutes that lead motorcycles on a merry chase through-and under-the streets of Los Angeles.<br />The Coopers have great screen presence and their acting performance was by far the best of any cast member. I look forward to seeing them in other movie genres: romantic comedy would be a natural.<br />There is one sour note however. In pursuit of a cinematic device called a 'plot', the story begins and ends in the only city in the world where there are no cars.<br /><br />Lynn Hoffman, author of The New Short Course in Wine

B00127RAJY|5.0|I recently purchased this for my son and I.  I am 43 and he is 24.  We have been using the Beach Body workouts for years, with results, and we love them.  But we needed something new.  Being a fan of the Biggest Loser, I've seen the results of Jillian's workouts.  So it was a no-brainer to purchase one of her DVDs.  We both know she would be tough and that's what we were looking for.  Needless to say, we've only done the workout once and BOY what a workout!  We are both sore, especially the legs!  In my opinion, if you are NOT in the best of shape, and you are looking for a challenging workout that's gonna make you sweat, buy this! And I can't imagine NOT getting results if we actually use it for 30 days!  So far, well worth the purchase price!
B0013D8LOK|2.0|What's the appeal behind Sweeny Todd?    I can sympathize with a wronged husband taking revenge on the guy who roofied and ravished his wife. I can appreciate a movie about a slasher on the loose.

I have to wonder about the people who thought this movie was such a beautiful experience. I knew it would be weird, after all, it's a Tim Burton affair, but man ....    Not that I'm down on Burton. I think he and Depp are a true powerhouse couple. Alan Rickman rules anything he's in. (Harry Potter films wouldn't be the right without him.)     The bright light came from Sacha Baron Cohen, the phony Italian rival of Sweeny Todd. It harkens back to the essence of Borat, just enough.
B00005JOFQ|1.0|It remains an insolvable enigma as to why Brokeback Mountain--this radicalized, g*y agenda-endorsing recruitment drive with no redeemable merits--has such an overwhelmingly, almost fanatically agreed-upon approval by reviewers who are either declining to use morals in evaluating the film, or are simply too naïve, short-sighted, or gullible to know better!!!! Brokeback Mountain is far from a controversial movie; insinuating that it's merely controversial makes it appear as though it has points of contention which have good arguments on either side. In morally clear and stark reality, however, Brokeback has absolutely no redeemable qualities since it advocates (in no particular order) the dissolution of marriage; alternative lifestyles which threaten the traditional, nuclear family; infidelity; and pursuit of one's animalistic lust in spite of the consequences.<br /><br />In a nutshell, Brokeback recounts the distressing story of two bisexuals who get into each other's pants while working as sheep herders in Wyoming; they worsen this irreligious affair by continuing their illegal, clandestine lust while being married and trying to raise families later on!!!! Reprimanding Brokeback for the g*y-pushing propaganda that it is isn't deserving of accusations of \\"bigotry\\"--as the simple-minded moral relativists who rave about Brokeback fall back on whenever their ideological movie is justifiably criticized. Besides the fact that the vast majority of Americans still rejects g*y marriage/civil unions and its destruction of traditional and therefore sustainable society, criticism against Brokeback also involves a totally non-g*y related issue: the advocacy of infidelity and the breakup of the nuclear family the film pushes.<br /><br />When Ennis and Jack \\"see\\" each other on their wilderness hikes, they're engaging in an illicit affair which callously hurts their respective wives and their innocent children!!!! If a person were to interpret Brokeback as the poster movie for the fictional concept of \\"g*y rights,\\" one can conclude that g*ys are for the destruction of families, the unit which ensures a stable, orderly society. G*ys themselves ought to exercise some moral clarity and be outraged that another liberal, Hollywood movie represents their demographic so unflatteringly. This movie is such a cold, typical, liberal-minded exercise in the ideology of \\"if it feels good, do it,\\" that it warrants the illicit lust of two g*ys to be together in total selfishness despite all the pain they're inflicting on their families and all the responsibilities they have to them.<br /><br />As with any predictable, liberal movie from Hollywood--which is misguidedly for the fiction that g*y \\"rights\\" are somehow \\"constitutional\\" despite that homosexuality is based only on willful behavior instead of something that's inherent in people--Brokeback abuses notions of longing and the alleged \\"true love\\" between Ennis and Jack to feloniously justify all the ruination their g*y relationship brings. The scheme of the devious filmmakers was clearly to cast Brokeback as a hard-to-believe, innocent \\"love story.\\" By perpetrating this fr*ud, the filmmakers are successful in provoking reactions of sentimentality and empathy from the generally moral relativist/unobservant, movie-going public, which direly needs some conservatism so they can identify these noxious schemes by the liberals in entertainment. By selling Brokeback as a mere \\"love story,\\" all the more sinister implications that I've rationally outlined above can be dismissed.<br /><br />This is the reprehensibly unscrupulous spin the moral relativist supporters of this film misuse to justify the radicalized, g*y-agenda push. However, even half-educated persons will be able to see through this ruse, as Brokeback Mountain is nothing but a fierce advocate for g*y marriage also. The movie's plot is maneuvered in such a way that the traditional, heterosexual marriages of Ellis and Alma and Jack and Lureen, respectively, are derided as \\"obstacles\\" which stand in the way of the g*y \\"love-fest\\" of Ennis and Jack. As such, Brokeback flagrantly pushes the misconstruction that Ennis and Jack could've been together and their families spared the pain if, and ONLY if, g*y marriage was legalized in the US (which will NEVER happen, thankfully, due to conservatives and traditionalists).<br /><br />Brokeback was an ideological movie which quickly lost the sensationalistic \\"steam\\" the liberal media kept forging for it, sputtering to a mean total of merely $83 million at the end of its domestic run. This not-too-surprising phenomenon was glaringly due to the fact that mainly liberals in the coastal, blue states were the primary driving force of this irreligious movie, but traditionalists in the Heartland, the Midwest and the South wisely didn't bother with this foulness.<br /><br />All the misleading exaggerations about the awards Brokeback's received are discreditable because the ones giving out the rewards are the same liberal, Hollywood and entertainment-circle degenerates who endorse g*y \\"rights.\\" Folks who misinform you that Brokeback's really about the love between two people are doing the work of g*y, special interests, as Brokeback glorifies infidelity, the ruination of marriage, and the hurting of children. Brokeback's recommended viewing so it can disclose to people just how anti-traditional and radicalized the \\"values\\" of the g*y marriage/\\"rights\\" cause are!!!!which stand in the way of the g*y \\"love-fest\\" of Ennis and Jack.

B000127LW2|5.0|This is one of my favorite star trek series, simply because the plot line forces them back in that orignal star trek dynamic but with better style.  I was going to buy mine on Amazon when they were $35, which is just about perfect for my price range as I want them all, but when they shot up to over $50 I went for a brand new copy off of Ebay.  Still a great series and I recommend it to any trekkies.
B000K7UBTI|5.0|Don't get confused, this is an anamated cartoon and not the new movie. If you read and liked the paper comic, this movie has much of the same feel and flavor of the comic book. The story does not match the comic book story line, and if you can take the new story as it comes, then it is a great time. I also recoment the Dr. Strange movie that Marvel put out in the same time frame.
B0014DBZY2|5.0|I first stumbled across the music of UK band Foals last Christmas on TV in the UK when I heard and fell in love with \\"Balloons\\". A hybrid of dance and rock, it reminded me of an other favourite band of mine; Franz Ferdinand.<br /><br />Their debut, \\"Antidotes\\" is more of the same; high octane dance/rock with jangly, melodic guitars. My favourites are \\"Olympic airways\\" and \\"Electric bloom\\", which are both insanely catchy dance rockers.<br /><br />However, it's a very tight race as much everything else is really great, from the more subdued and jangly \\"Big big love (Fig. 2)\\" with lovely rolling guitar sounds, the opening horn sprinkled epic \\"The French open\\" (with a Ska feel which morphs into something slightly African), the awesome \\"Red sock pugie\\" (starting off with skittery beats and spacey effects), the hand clap-filled instrumental \\"Like swimming\\", and closing cut the synth based \\"Tron\\" (with fleeting horns and haunting harmonies) which is truly dazzling.<br /><br />This album is incredibly catchy and clever. The album hit #3 in the UK, and I hope they hit it big like they truly deserve.
B000QXDHDI|5.0|why this band is so underrated. Virgin Steele have amazing talent, I heard Through Blood and Fire and I was shocked by what I heard. Absolutely amazing piece of metal, raw and heavy. Sounds just like heavy metal. And yet TBAF isn't even the best song on here.<br /><br />One negative factor - 16 tracks, out of which 6 are not full length songs (Blood of Vengeance, Death God, God of Sorrows, Vow of Honour, Amaranth and Marriage of Heaven and Hell)<br /><br />Track by track review -<br /><br />Blood of Vengeance - 9/10. Manages to be an intro without sounding overly long. Which leads us straight into...<br /><br />Invictus - 10/10. A relentless tune this is, perfect way of opening, instantly grabbing. I swear cream was coming out of my ear...<br /><br />Mind, Body, Spirit - 8/10. Kind of a bit forgettable compared with other tracks. Still a great song though.<br /><br />In the Arms of the Death God - 4/10. Unlike BoV, this is a razther prolonged intro. Apart from the first 15 seconds everything hear can be found in Through Blood and Fire. Leading us into -<br /><br />Through Blood and Fire - 9/10. This is an amazing tune. A very melodic chorus with the familiar harsh screams for the verses.<br /><br />Sword of the Gods - 12/10. This is possibly my favourite track. There is nothing weak here, just a very epic song. Not so heavy as the three opening songs but really grabbing.<br /><br />God of Our Sorrows - 8/10. A 1:19 ballad that was composed by David DeFeis by accident. If you think of Iced Earth's - The Pierced Spirit this is very similar but a lot better. Simple tune but works nicely.<br /><br />Vow of Honour - 8.5/10. Some very melodic screams repeated. That's all this tune is but it sounds cool.<br /><br />Defiance - 10/10. One of my favourites. Very \\"in your face\\" tune this is. Complete slayer.<br /><br />Dust from the Burning - 8/10. Kind of Forgettable. Still enjoyable whenever I hear it though.<br /><br />Amaranth - 7/10. Cool intro, clocking in 0:21. Goes into the next song well though.<br /><br />A Whisper of Death - 10/10. Starts out like a stunning ballad. Heaviness kicks in at 1:43. I can forgive this as the song is nearly 9 minutes in length. Another relentless tune, kind of like the title track but I enjoy this one more.<br /><br />Dominion Day - 9/10. Yarrrrrrrrrrrr! More relentless music. The chorus always stays in my head and I can't forget it.<br /><br />A Shadow of Fear - 8/10. See \\"Dust From the Burning\\"<br /><br />The Marriage of Heaven and Hell - 6/10. Would have been a lot better if the pause had been taken out between this and...<br /><br />Veni, Vidi, Vici - 12/10. This is the reason why SotG didn't automatically get given top track award. I can't decide between these two which is better. I hate the We Crown Us Kings line though. Because as soon as it ends, I return into the real world.<br /><br />Goddamn real world! This Steele takes me away from it and now I return back to the real world.<br /><br />Songs to check out (I know I shouldn't do this many but decision was too tough) -<br /><br />Invictus<br />Sword of the Gods<br />Defiance<br />A Whisper of Death<br />Veni, Vidi, Vici
B000X418UE|5.0|I just purchased this film in Blu-ray and a few weeks ago, and it is almost the best transfer in Blu-ray of this action classic since Criterion issued several years ago.  There is a little grain in some scenes but overall this is a great improvement over the Standard Def version. Michael Bay, in my opinion, is not a great Director and I bristled at his comments during the HD vs Blu-ray war. His recent \\"Transformers\\" left me cold when it arrived in the theatres and I didn't even finish that and went into another theatre (thank god for multiplexes). The Connery-Cage duo really clicks and Ed Harris is excellent in the role as the misguided warrior. This was the last film for the Simpson-Buckheimer team since Simpson died of a drug overdose shortly after completing this film. Connery in his action mode is still ageless and Cage offers a great comical counterpoint to him in their scenes together.  Also the under-rated Michael Biehn is fine in his brief appearance as the Marine sworn to bring Harris & Co under his command. The rest of the supporting cast is also excellent such as the late John Spencer, Stuart Wilson as a general, David Morse as Harris second in command and Phillip Baker Hall as an old buddy of Connery's who has a secret.  This disc is a great demo to show off your sound system particularly in the final moments!!  Recommended whole heartedly for action buffs!!
B0015D3Z4O|3.0|I was very excited about the prospect of this album while being a little bit nervous about how much of Madonna's identity would get sucked into the Timbaland/Neptunes machinery.  Overall, I think the album is a 50-50 split.  There are some terrific tracks (\\"She's Not Me\\", \\"Miles Away\\", \\"The Beat Goes On\\", \\"Heartbeat\\"), some fun, if fairly generic dance club movers (\\"Give it 2 Me\\", \\"Candy Shop\\", \\"4 Minutes\\"), one mess of a song (\\"Incredible\\"), and an ending that just seems to fizzle out over the last four songs.  Some songs she is front and center.  Others find her buried in the production.  Very little going on lyrically throughout.  Clearly there is an effort to return to the more consistently pop/club friendly albums that characterized her earliest output (as opposed to her most recent albums that seem to be a mish-mash of chart friendly songs back-to-back with somewhat charmless philosophical statements).  Ultimately, I find the album to be more enjoyable than the overrated \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" and certainly more fun than \\"American Life,\\" but amidst the sweets there are a few suckers and empty calories.

The middle part of the book however, her trip to India, is really long and super boring. I almost stopped reading the book at that point but make it through because it picks up again in the third portion when she goes to Bali.

B000N3ST7K|5.0|I think it goes without saying that Quentin Tarantino puts together the best soundtracks for his movies. This one is no exception. A collection of great songs that bring you right back into the movie with a sprinkling of great dialogue. Perfect.
B0013FBS20|5.0|I watched this movie several times. I found some glitches (like you will find on any other movie) but the great thing is the alternative ending which I think it is much better than the one they showed in the theatrical version. The picture quality is very good just as the soundmix.  You will not be dissapointed with this blu-ray title.

Jim Rhodes<br />Jeff Bridges ...  Obadiah Stane<br />Gwyneth Paltrow ...  Pepper Potts<br />Leslie Bibb ...  Christine Everhart<br /><br />Jon Favreau directed this movie and plays a small role and Iron Man creator Stan Lee even has a cameo in the movie.<br /><br />Personally I thought Gwyneth Paltrow was great in her role. The movie itself has a great story, great back story and outstanding ending.<br /><br />The Spiderman trilogy was good, Iron Man is on a whole other level!<br /><br />See this one!
B001041JKU|5.0|With all the drama surrounding Michael aside, he is a complete legend. It is amazing how After 25 years this album could still be so popular. Michael Jacksons thriller is an American constitution, something all humans on earth should hear. The only thing i don't like about this 25th anniversary is they used \\"will i am\\". \\"will i am\\" should not be on a Michael Jackson album. With hits like \\"Smooth criminal\\", \\"thriller\\", \\"billie jean\\", and \\"beat it\\" it is clear Michael Jackson is a LEGEND.    Onto the track by track review:    1~ Wanna be starting something [4/10]    this is my least favorite track on the album. I just have a hard time following the lyrics. the beat is really good though, thats where the 4 stars comes from. I would recommend this track to anybody who likes to dance. you could dance the night away with this one :)    2~ Baby be mine [10/10]    Maybe its just because i am in complete love with a girl at my school, but this song melts me. The lyrics are full of expression, Michael must have had a very special someone when writing and/or singing this song.  his voice is wonderful here, his singing is top grade. Let me touch ont he lyrics again: this songs lyrical content is 2nd best on the album next to \\"thriller\\". The lyrics express what every person in love feels, and says what we all want to say but don't have the courage..\\"baby be mine\\"    3~ the girl is mine [10/10]    I just gave this song a chance, because Paul McCartney is my least favorite beetle. But i should listened to it earlier, paul McCartney shines on this gem. the lyrics to this song are amazing, and consist of mostly \\"The doggone girl is mine\\". This is a good track to listen to once you finally get that special someone you love. Not much else to saya bout this one, just listen to it for your self.    4~ Thriller [50/10]    There is no review needed for this song.     5~ Beat it [9/10]    One of Jacksons masterpieces. Has a really great guitar riff in the beginning. The chorus is addictivelike cocaine, and the lyrics are aggressive and forceful. It sounds to me like Jackson mixes singing with a hint of rapping. The only reason this song gets 9 stars is because it is really short, WE NEED MORE. oh yea, i forgot to mention the guitar solo in this song is TOP GRADE    6~ Billie jean 10/10    This song is one of Michael Jacksons best. Very refreshing and brilliant.  The beat is almost as good as the lyrics. I am in love with the bridge and chorus    7~ Human nature 1,000,000,000,000,000/10    Ok, this is the best song on the album, and my favorite song by Michael  Jackson. This song hits my top 5 favorite songs of all time, probably my second favorite of all time. I can't put what this song means to me into words, i recommend this song to all, everybody needs to listen to this song.     8~ pretty young thing (P.Y.T) 4/10    I can respect this song musically, its a good song, but i personally don't like it too much, it will get 4 stars for being a decent over all song.      I'm not going to review the new tracks, they all suck IMO. But this album alone, is amazing. EVERYBODY GET IT
B00000GAIW|5.0|Have always loved this recording.  Now I enjoy what was once only on vinyl or tape.
0618918248|5.0|I found this the most enjoyable of the \\"Torah of Atheism\\":  The God Delusion  God is Not Great  The End of Faith  The Atheist Bible &  Letter to a Christian Nation.    The best part about reading this book (and the others) is that you realize that thare are a great many that share your thought on topics that you never really discussed in public. These books help you understand that it is ok to reject the nonsense that was drilled into us as unsuspecting children. As you read these books and start discussing them with friends you'll find that most (not all) agree with what Dawkins and the others have to say, yet they still are reluctant to switch teams. Be sensitive, though, to your friends that are among the faithful, some may be offended if you suggest that their beliefs are built on myths and lies.    As a gift idea, you may want to send some of your independent minded friends \\"The Atheists Bible\\" as a Christmas present.
B0013V33DG|5.0|It is wonderful that we are now able to buy DVDs of operas that are still doing the circuits of the major opera houses in both Europe and the United States. I recently acquired the Natalie Dessay and Juan Diego Florez version of `La Fille du Regiment' recorded at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden. As soon as I opened the case and saw it was a Virgin Classics release, I knew that the audio and video elements of the package were going to be of a very high standard as was the case of an earlier Virgin Classics purchase of Rossini's `La Grande-Duchesse du Gerolstein' of which I have posted a very positive review. I was not disappointed, as soon as the overture started it was apparent that this was going to be an even more entertaining version of this work than the Patizia Ciofi and Florez version of the same opera from the Teatro Carlo Felice in Genoa. This latest work is fun to watch all the way through, there are no dull spots, and everyone sings well and is well recorded. If I had to mention one disappointment it would be the somewhat abstract stage-sets used in both acts; the detailed ones from Genoa are significantly better and more interesting. One huge asset (no pun intended) in this version is the presence of Dawn French as the Duchess de Crackentorp. It is almost a quarter of a century since I remember watching her as half of the French and Saunders comedy duo on British television. Her presence here in the second act is quite brief, but every moment she is on the stage, she had me in stitches.<br /><br />I suppose the major point of interest is, who is the better Marie, the daughter of the Regiment? That is not an easy question to answer. I loved Miss Dessay's voice and the ease with which she was able to accomplish even the most difficult passages. I also enjoyed the way she threw her entire being into the comedic aspects of the role. However, on balance I think the edge goes to Miss Ciofi who, while giving a slightly less boisterous performance and maybe taking a little more effort to sing some of the more difficult sections, is overall the singer/actress with the best presentation and the one I most prefer to watch. Would I be prepared to part with either of these DVDs? Definitely not, both are terrific versions of a comic opera that will appeal to everyone and will give much enjoyment to young and oldlittle more effort to sing some of the more difficult sections, is overall the singer/actress with the best presentation and the one I most prefer to watch.

0767802470|5.0|Wow....this DVD is a real winner, Though long, I found myself sitting on the edge of my chair and feeling as though I was almost there and in portions of the movie I was so immersed when things would happen, I'd jump like I was there. I had the good fortune to go aboard the U505 in Chicago when it first arrived there and I always wanted to learn more, watching this DVD filled that void.  This gripping story of a sub under attack and the final outcome is supreme.  Anyone who enjoys stories about Subs and the people in them will love it.

B00004SA8A|5.0|Schubert's Piano Sonatas essentially are rather private and occasionally introspective works. They are \\"more Wigmore Hall than Albert Hall\\" and perhaps this is one reason why they are not so often included in public performances but \\"Hausmusik\\" these works are not.     Elliot Richman in an earlier review has said \\"Modern players, despite their steel fingers and elephantine endurance and machine-like (sometimes machine-gun-like) techniques, stand to learn a lot from this old master's art.\\" How true, how true! Similar exemplars of Kempff's less frenetic approach include Clifford Curzon, Friedrich Wuhrer and Walter Gieseking. Perhaps in some measure it is appropriate that these Sonatas are bypassed by a few of today's heavy hitters on the international recital circuit for these intimate works do not respond well to modern robotics. I am reminded of Rosalyn Tureck's observation: \\"I have seen a diminution of passionate involvement in the art of music and I have seen a crescendo in passionate involvement with careers\\".    None of the Sonatas was publicly performed in Schubert's lifetime. This is a sad quirk of history and certainly not a reflection of their musical worth. Beethoven had thirty of his Sonatas published posthumously but in my view these lovely, often haunting Schubert gems are deserving of an  appreciation very much wider than they seem to have; certainly beyond the B flat major and a couple of others which are better known.    Wilhelm Kempff's performance here is to his customary and uniquely high standard of interpretation and empathetic treatment; that alone makes this set a \\"must buy\\". Whilst the recordings can be a trifle woolly in places and probably would benefit from the digital magic which Deutsche Grammophon successfully has applied to some other older performances, the quality is entirely acceptable and any shortcomings are in no sense obtrusive.     I adore these pieces; it is very evident that Wilhelm Kempff does too.
1881273156|4.0|The Five Love Languages is marriage guru Gary Chapman's book on expressing love and commitment to a spouse. The goal here is to get readers to be able to \\"fill the emotional tanks\\" of their spouses, which does not always come naturally because people receive love in different ways.<br /><br />Chapman begins with explaining his \\"love tank\\" idea (which is corny, but good), gives a diatribe against the \\"falling in love\\" condition, then outlines his five love languages: words of affirmation, quality time, receiving gifts, acts of service, and physical touch. He concludes with various remarks about love, particularly love as a choice. The book ends with little quizzes spouses can take to discover their own love languages.<br /><br />The book on the whole feels oversimplified. Chapman does not point out here that the kind of love a person likes to receive is not always the kind of love that same person gives. In fact, he suggests the opposite. Chapman's dialogue with the couples he speaks with (as he reports it) is distractingly stilted and unnatural. Even though the book is less than 200 pages, it drags at times, as Chapman beats the horse on each point.<br /><br />In The Five Love Languages, things are clearly oversimplified. Nevertheless there is some valuable material here. Specifically, there are two important points to take away: that people receive love in different ways, and that love is a choice and an action. From that perspective, almost anyone who is married can benefit from this book.

0446577391|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It was a quick and easy read.  However, I will say you will get more of out of it if you read the two previous books.  It can stand alone but you will want to know the backstory of why people are doing what they do and making the decisions that they make.  I loved the Camel Club members for all their quirks and talents.  I really did enjoy the interplay between Oliver and Carter Gray.  Mr. Baldacci writes depth to his characters so that you feel you know them and what they are going to do but you don't.  I was totally shocked by the ending and what happens.  Not the last two pages ending but the last 25 pages ending.  How it all goes down.  It has a lot of twists and turns that are unexpected but seem to make perfect sense.  I hope this isn't the last of the Camel Club but I suspect it is.  I would highly recommend any of David Baldacci's books but would strongly suggest you read these three books.  They will definitely keep your interest.
B000M3452Y|2.0|LCD Soundsystem - Sound of Silver (2007)<br /><br />I like dance music, but this CD is just too repetitive. True, there are some cool sounds, but nothing I haven't heard before. In fact, this James Murphy character cribs plenty from other artists. I can't always put my finger on it, but much of what I hear on this album rings a bell of familiarity. For example, I hear some elements of Can (and Murphy doesn't hide his affection for that group either).<br /><br />Having influences isn't in itself a problem; everyone has influences. But you have to build on those influences and take them in different directions for the music to be worthwhile. Everything on this record makes me think, \\"been there, done that.\\" True, the songs do subtly evolve, but the repetitive elements are so prominent that they render the album monotonous. I much prefer dance music that has more to offer in the way of actual songs.
B0015D3Z4O|3.0|This CD is NOT THAT BAD!  Why so many people say it's horrible while others rave about it?  And why so many people compare it to Confessions on the Dancefloor?  Yeah, Hard Candy is very different but that's what makes Madonna Madonna.  She never sticks to one formula and that's what separates her from the rest.  (And that's why she's still relevant after 25 years in the music business).  On the 1st listen, I didn't quite like it either but after a few spins, I started to like it more and more and now I can't stop listening to it.  I like every track and I don't skip any of them.  Tracks that stand out for me are She's Not Me (disco meets the Neptures), Heartbeat (Nelly Furtado anyone?), Give It 2 Me (very 80ish) and the best of all is Voices (last track on the CD). In my opinion, it's her best CD since Ray of Light.
B000003TAW|5.0|One of the best 90's albums. How have I never bought it before!? But I own it now!
B0012K1ILW|4.0|I've loved all her albums and this one is no different.  Nearly every track is dope.  I only wish there was 1 or 2 more slow ones like Telephone.
B00005R2M3|4.0|I know, I'm behind the times. I have listened to Shakira since she broke into the American music scene but only just now got around to buying this album.<br /><br />I've heard and read about tons of people who complain she's too commercial on this album. Fine, it's pop. Meaning popular.<br /><br />Still, even if you're distracted by that there's no doubt that her voice is haunting. Just freaking awesome. She stands out.<br /><br />I plan on getting most her other albums over time. This one is a lot fun to listen too.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|This album is wonderful!!  The Boss sounds as great as ever, and he proves once again that he still has a lot to say.  My only regret is that I didn't buy it sooner!  \\"Living in the Future\\" is a kick, \\"Radio Nowhere\\" says what I think a lot of people are thinking.  Just a wonderful CD all the way around!
B0007Q6PBK|5.0|A marvelous version of this great opera.  The 'young' Pavoratti's voice simply soars.  I saw the new Met version recently which was excellent, but no comparison in tenors.  What a loss too soon when he died.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Life lessons, civics lessons, problem solving lessons and deeply human through and through.  Oh where it so that the the country could aspire to be like this.  Take your family, especially teens through this series.
B000XTLUW0|4.0|You can't beat the price for getting a fantastic concert on DVD and CD.    A great concert film.  My only gripe is that the cuts are almost too fast at times so you can't see the full glory of their phenomenal ability to play guitar and bass.    The after effects are a bit much as far as processing everything in black and white and then colorizing certain areas.  While it works in distant shots and more static shots, fast pans and quick zooms distract from what is being presented.      The audio quality though is fantastic, both for the DTS on the DVD and the actual CD as well.
B000B7QCKO|5.0|I have seen the DVD at least 10 times since I purchased it and listened to the CD at lease twice as many and I love every moment of it.

B0000DZ3EA|5.0|Almost everything on Peter Gabriel's previous collection 'Shaking The Tree' and more is now available on the two CD set 'Hit.' This compilation holds a special place in my CD collection.    All of the fan favorites are here. 'Sledgehammer,' 'Shock The Monkey,' 'Big Time,' 'In Your Eyes' and one of my personal favorites, 'The Tower That Ate People' all appear on this two CD collection, released on Geffen, Gabriel's longtime home in 2003.    It's great to hear all of these songs digitally remastered. The sound quality is superb!    But, there are several flaws here. 'Shock The Monkey' is the radio edit version and not the original 'Security' album version. They chopped it down from 5:32 to 3:54 because of CD space. And there are several other radio edits here too. And, as a previous reviewer pointed out, there is nothing from his second album, which doesn't really bother me that much, but it is a tad disappointing.    But despite those flaws, this is an excellent PG compilation. Highly recommneded for any Gabriel fan. A great set. ENJOY!!!
B000YAA68C|3.0|When I read the book I was very excited about seeing certain parts up on the screen. Unfortunately the bits I liked were not even in the movie, and they changed it around so much that it was barely recognisable. I wasn't impressed with the casting and was not moved at all. Don't know why they can't just stick to the plot as written.
6305127697|5.0|My Daughter has been wanting this movie forever and couldn't find it in any stores. Thank you for having such an extensive DVD selection on both new and used. Also your prices are fantastic! This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Both Gere and Norton are amazing in this movie. A MUST SEE!!
B000JJRIO8|2.0|I realize Lil John does not provide any production on this album, but he might as well have. What is up with these disgusting Snyth club joints? Pac's rolling in his grave listening to this bull. Again, I agree the bootleg versions are far superior. You want something to sound like Pac, then you need to have a funky groove, and some soul. Earlier posthumous albums understood that. Especially Better Dayz, R U Still Down,and Still I Rise. This CD is a travesty to this man's legacy.
1881273156|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It came highly recommend to me. I also got the CD to listen to in the car. The one \\"draw back\\" if it really is one, is that you really do get more from the book if your partner reads it too. You can still apply it onesided but it would work better if you get cooperation. I found it to be interesting and feel that it can be applied in real life. The religious context in the book is not overwelming so if you don't feel comfortable with a religious book know that it is not overpowering.
B000YABYLA|5.0|It's not that unheard of a plot. The real beauty is in the dialog. Juno is an amazing character. The unique soundtrack add a wonderful, fun vide to the entire movie.
B0007M22TI|3.0|I think this one was the first video of celtic woman, and many good songs that sing beautifully.

B0001ENY6M|5.0|i love the soundtrack tothi sfilm. it adds to the drama being played out on screen. as i hear some of the tracks, for example, 'mary goes to jesus' i can see the scene in my head. this is the part in the film where i just completely lost it. the interaction between mother and son. just beautiful music
B000002KIT|5.0|A few years ago Classic Rock magazine did a readers and critics poll to decide on the best live album of all time.  In both cases \\"Alive And Dangerous\\" came in at the top of the list.  I owned this album on vinyl back in the day, and after reading all of the praise about it decided to replace it on CD.  Since the time of it's release a lot been made about the significant amount of overdubbing that was done on the album.  To me that does take a bit away from the \\"live\\" aspect of this whole project, but it does remain a fine slice of music, from one of the more underrated bands of the 70's.  This really is a fantastic album.  Lizzy never really made that much of an impact in America after \\"Jailbreak\\" and it's bit hit \\"The Boys Are Back In Town\\" . It is really too bad because they were one of the best twin guitar rock bands of their era.  Lizzy was the birthplace of a bevy of guitarists move through the band over the years and this album featured Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson.  They are on top of their game throughout this disc.  Phil Lynott was the consument front man and drummer Brian Downey held down the bottom end.  All of Lizzy's classics are here and the band show a ton of versatility going from boogie rock, to metal, to songs that are almost progressive rock without even a blink.  Lizzy is an underappreciated band and this album serves as a great introduction to what they were all about.
B0015AARJI|5.0|It may have took a little over a year but Sony finally released a true PS3 controller. One of the things I like about the DS3 is that it seems much more sturdier and durable unlike the cheap feeling six-axis. I am currently playing gta4 and the rumble works great in it. The only downside is that not every game supports the rumble like Call of Duty 4 but that doesn't matter to me that much because the feel is what brings it all together for me. It's everything I hoped for in a controller.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|One wonders how Stephen Sondheim ever thought of a notorious 19th-century serial killer's exploits as suitable subject matter for a Broadway musical.  Yet \\"Sweeney Todd\\" opened in 1979 to excellent critical reaction.   It's taken this long for the play to come to the screen.  There were several attempts that never came to fruition, changing public tastes to contend with, and Sondheim's trademark protectiveness of his work.  Now, \\"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" makes the transition from stage to screen surprisingly well, despite heavy pruning of its musical numbers.   The setting is Victorian London.  Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp), lives a contented life as a barber with his wife Lucy (Laura Michelle Kelly) and infant daughter Johanna until Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman), lusting for Lucy, has Barker deported to Australia on false charges and rapes Lucy, who poisons herself in despair.  Johanna becomes Judge Turpin's ward.   Many years later Barker, now calling himself Sweeney Todd, returns to London and visits an old friend, the pie maker Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), whose upper floor used to serve as his barber shop.  He decides to reopen for business, aiming to exact vengeance on Judge Turpin.   Depp is playing a man older than his real age, and convinces with both make-up and a consistently grim expression.  He is not the greatest singer on the planet, but he sells the songs, using his acting skills and relying on the camera's ability to practically see into his soul.  We feel for him because of how mightily he's been wronged, and this balances the on-screen violence.  Though most of his victims are innocent men who simply want a shave, we find ourselves oddly intrigued by his proficiency with the blade and, especially, with how efficiently he disposes of body after body.  Not since Norman Bates has the screen seen such a fascinating serial killer.   Director Tim Burton, who directed Depp in \\"Edward Scissorhands,\\" \\"Ed Wood,\\" \\"Sleepy Hollow,\\" and \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\\" gives \\"Sweeney Todd\\" such a feel for the squalid underbelly of London that you can almost smell it.  From the first scene, when we see Sweeney sail up the Thames under Tower Bridge to the crowded, narrow, cobbled streets that pedestrians have to share with rats, the film's atmosphere envelops the bloody tale being unfolded.  The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski uses a very muted color palette, saving bright hues for dramatic effect, such as when Sweeney wields his razor and blood spurts from the necks of his victims.  Yes, these scenes leave little to the imagination, but the bloodletting is extremely stylized.  On stage, there was some stage blood, but on screen, with close-ups, the gore is magnified.   Ms. Carter serves up an interesting portrayal of Mrs. Lovett, who becomes Sweeney's accomplice in crime.  Her skill -- or lack of it -- at baking meat pies, her attraction to Sweeney, and her entrepreneurship make her a fascinating character.  On stage, Angela Lansbury played her broadly and comically as an eccentric floozy.  Carter's interpretation is less music hall, more Grand Guignol, a choice that is wise and fits better into Burton's vision.   Comic relief is provided by Sacha Baron Cohen as Signor Adolfo Pirelli, a pompous barber who is challenged to a duel of barbers by Sweeney.  Cohen is flamboyantly appropriate, neatly stealing his big scene.  Dressed in a royal blue outfit that looks more suitable for the French court than a dingy London lower-class neighborhood, he carries himself like an aristocrat though, at heart, he is just one more snake oil salesman.     Excellent supporting performances are provided by Timothy Spall as Beadle Bamford, a cohort of Judge Turpin; Anthony Hope as the sailor who befriends Sweeney on the journey to England and becomes smitten with Johanna when he sees her gazing out her window; Rickman as Judge Turpin; and young Ed Sanders as Toby.     Spall looks like a character directlyout of Charles Dickens and is absolutely believable as a toady whose powerful office allows him to bend the law or wield it at his discretion.   Sanders has quite a large role as Toby, the abused assistant of Pirelli who later is taken under the wing of Sweeney and Mrs. Lovett.  He has a great ragamuffin look, and a bright smile that belies the awful treatment Toby's endured first in the workhouses and then under Pirelli's cruel apprenticeship.  He is treated kindly at Sweeney's for the first time in his life.  His rendition of Sondheim's beautiful ballad \\"Not While I'm Around\\" is extremely moving.     Other songs that made it into the film include  \\"Johanna,\\" \\"Pretty Women,\\" and the darkly comic \\"The Worst Pies in London,\\" performed by Mrs. Lovett as cockroaches scramble willy nilly across her kitchen counter.   Rated R for its graphic violence, \\"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" succeeds because its strong story forms the substance of the movie, performances are uniformly first-rate and the production design is evocative.
B000LXHK22|5.0|A great feel good movie with a change of pace for Russell Crowe and a nice touch of humor added. The scenery is beautiful and makes one want to travel to France and stay in a Chateau with a vineyard. I have watched this movie numerous times and always walk away with a smile. Russell Crowe should make more like this!!
B000EQHHJW|4.0|This is a strong production filled with beautiful and dramatic singing, and Wixell's playing a dual role tightens the story. Some artistic lapses in the directing are made up for by the exceptional final act.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Wow, what an album. This is probebly my favorite one out of all SOAD's CD's for a couple reasons. First, the guitar really stands out, it seems the electric guitar is more involved in Mezmerize than in Hypnotize. This especially showed in B.Y.O.B. The songs also seem more unique next to each other in Mezmerize, compared to Hypnotize, which though is still a great album. My favorite songs are of course B.Y.O.B. and Cigaro. I can't get anough of Cigaro...its melody and vocals are so good I can't beleive it.<br /><br />Mezmerize has a very strong tone and changes mood much more than in the bands' other Albums. Though it just has 11 songs, its all worth listening to.<br /><br />Defenetly a great album. 5 stars!
0143038419|5.0|First book I have ever read where I decided to mark the pages for future reference!

Bravo Elizabeth.
B0000033J9|4.0|Love the movie, love the music.  This musical CD will take you back 30 years to the story and magic of Dr. Zhivago.  Definitely will want to add it to your music collection if this movie was a favorite.

B000001E3V|5.0|I got this album out last night mindful of the fact that its coming up to 40 years since those ominus signs started to appear on the concrete walls of a sleepy London town Clapton is God. Its hard not to wonder what this was all about unless though you have heard this album.    Clapton was was at his peak during this period and his development as a guitarist was complete. He played with ease during these sets his voice also matched the time.    Truly an anthem that is capable of transporting one right back to where it all started. Certainly a place I expect to keep going.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|The magic of John Mayer's music lies in the way how simple and easy to understand it is to an average listener, while keeping excellent quality that should satisfy even the most morose and sharp critics. It is no exaggeration to name \\"Continuum\\" not only one of the best albums of the decade, but also to demand ensuring it a place on TOP 100 lists of all time and adding John Mayer to Hall of Fame. I give such praise very rarely, here are my reasons:    1) songwriting is extra strong  2) every man can identify with lyrics, John Mayer is not playing too intellectual or sophisticated, yet the words are by no means trite  3) and maybe the most powerful side of the album are its instrumental performances and arrangements.     Mayer, an excellent guitar player (who else could cover Jimi Hendrix's \\"Bold As Love\\" profusely and not make it sound out-of-place on a breezy pop-blues album like this?) surrounded himself with a group of equally excellent musicians (e.g. Pino Palladino), giving each song its very own feel, making them uniformly beautiful, different from each other and at the same time wonderfully accessible.    Lyrical side is strong, too - while John's unassuming modesty encourages every listener to confide in him with his broken heart or joy in return, Mayer touches also on the worldwide events (\\"Waiting On A World To Change\\"), even doing it in an irresistible musical way (witness \\"Belief\\", one of the best-arranged tune of recent years). And when you think that the next song just cannot be so great as the previous one, comes the ballad  \\"Dreaming With A Broken Heart\\" or a closer \\"I'm Gonna Find Another You\\", where a simple, light breakup tune is profoundly helped by a bluesy structure.    Thanks, John. This album should stay immortal.
B00028HBL6|1.0|So many well-meaning Christians have found something to like about this film that I, a lifelong film buff but also a Christian, hesitate to express my views. Alas, I find little about this film that is likeable or meritable.   First, the makeup and prosthetics were lamentably bad! The film had the feel of a concoction. For me, it lacked depth, gravity, artistic impact, rather like watching someone paint by numbers, or else place ingredients into a jar and shake them up, hoping they will come out arranged in some artistically rewarding order. Where was the inspiration?  The one scene I liked- and I liked it very much- was when Jesus was at home and working as a carpenter. It boded so well...   Alternatives? 'Jesus' starring Brian Deacon, or even the silent 'King of Kings'- neither of which is unimpeachable, but both of which are preferable.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|This is with out a doubt the greatest album ever recorded. The lyrics are straight from the heart and the musical arrangements are incredible! I personally feel that this album highlights Jeff Tweedy's writing ability as well as the band's ability to be comfortable \\"in their own skin\\". There are songs that are relaxing (\\"Either Way\\", \\"Sky Blue Sky\\"), songs of dispair (\\"You are My Face\\", \\"Please be Patient With Me\\"), which are my two favorites, and songs of great hope (\\"Impossible Germany\\", \\"What Light\\", and \\"On and On and On\\"). This album, believe it or not, saved our marriage. Thank you Jeff Tweedy and Wilco for putting out an album with so much heart and a long lasting message.
B00005UOKM|4.0|This disc gathers the three players who pushed Blue Note jazz furthest in the direction of the avant garde in the late 1960s: Hutcherson on vibes, Andrew Hill on piano, and Sam Rivers on tenor and soprano sax, bass clarinet, and flute.  Freddie Hubbard on trumpet, Richard Davis on bass, and Joe Chambers on drums round out the session.  The disc alternates between rhythmically and harmonically complex tunes written by Hill and more free tunes written by Chambers.  The Hill tunes--\\"Catta,\\" \\"Les Noirs Marchant,\\" \\"Ghetto Lights,\\" and \\"Jasper\\"--are all five stars.  As is typical of Hill's compositions, he makes use of the all six players in the group to layer complex rhythms and harmonies and does so without sacrifing the real fire and inspiration the group plays with, especially on \\"Catta.\\"  \\"Jasper\\"--a bonus track not on the original album--is more of a straight ahead blues that includes some tremendous soloing by both Rivers and Hubbard.    The free compositions by Chambers--\\"Idle While\\" and \\"Dialogue\\"--don't reach the heights of the Hill compositions.  Free jazz works best when someone really takes the lead--or when several players do simultaneously--but no one really does that here, making all of the players seem a bit unsure of themselves.  \\"Dialogue\\" is just that, a dialogue between the players.  However, their lines and responses and extremely abbreviated--typically about one measure long--so their musical \\"conversation\\" never really takes off.      This is especially recommended for fans of Hill's compositions, though he isn't given much solo time.  Those looking for some great 60s avant garde stuff on Blue Note should check out Rivers' \\"Contours\\" or \\"Fuscia Swing Song\\" before returning back here.

B0002ZDVEU|4.0|When last we saw Jason Bourne in \\"The Bourne Identity\\", he'd forgotten who he was, then remembered, maybe, just in time to eliminate as many clues to his continued existence as he could before leaving Paris for a secret life somewhere else (actually, a remote Greek island) with his new love, Maria.  The Bourne Supremacy starts a couple of years later and, like TBI, begins in the middle, with Bourne trying to remember what happened in the beginning before escaping at the end.    The initial setting for the action this time is Berlin.  Whatever US covert agency is at work appears to be setting up some sort of scam to catch a thief of money, secrets, or both; unfortunately the scam goes bad and the target gets the money and the secrets, leaving only some dead bodies and some clumsy evidence that Jason Bourne is to blame.  This time, another wonk is in the mix -- or a wonkette, Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), freshening the machismo with a blast of blonde estrogen.  We then catch up with Jason and Maria in Goa, India, where they live in relative safety while Jason starts to unravel a whole new set of recurring nightmares set in Berlin and narrated by Conklin's ghost.  Unfortunately, the bad guys have already tracked JB to Goa and head there to rub him out, making it look like he was responsible for the Berlin disaster if no one knows he was still alive first.  Jason survives but becomes more resolute to determine why the government is still after him.  Landy's built with more integrity than Conklin was, and she suspects the case against Bourne is too pat, learning more about his past in the process (since she wasn't in the first movie).  The question then becomes who finds out first what happened in Berlin, and why Bourne was implicated.    To say that TBS is my least favorite of the Bourne trilogy is not to say it isn't a very good film.  My biggest beef would be the absence of other \\"assets\\" for Bourne to take on, but that's the way the story turned -- Bourne has a fine antagonist in an amoral Russian mercenary (Karll Urban).  The foreign settings are fun, and the producers came up with excellent set pieces in Goa and Berlin.  But the most memorable part will always be the car chase in Moscow, where things come to a head.  Greenglass's direction of this chase puts it in the cream of the crop; it stands up and demands comparison to movies as different as \\"Bullitt\\". \\"The French Connection\\", and \\"Ronin\\", not to mention TBI's chase in Paris.  On top of that, Bourne's tutelage by Macguyver pays off as he improvises foot escapes in both Berlin and Russia.  Finally, the movie delivers the trilogy's best \\"Depends\\" moment.    One of the most famous, or infamous, aspects of this film and TBU is the hand-held camera work of Greenglass.  In a theater, this movie is most effectively viewed closer to the center of the screen.  That's less important in TBS than TBU, in my opinion.  For home viewing, even on what passes for a small screen nowadays (mine is 32 inches) the camera work doesn't interfere with the movie.    The Bourne Supremacy delivers on its promise to keep Bourne in action through some tight stories and tighter curves.  If it's not the greatest movie in the series, that's just because it's stuck between two great bookends.

1573921394|5.0|One sometimes hears that money is the root of all evil. Keynes would agree, but not because of any animosity towards the profit motive (Keynes was definitely not a socialist and he even agreed with and endorsed Hayek's \\"The Road to Serfdom\\"), but because in an economy using money imbalances between the value in any currency of demand and the value of supply are possible.<br /><br />Virtually all economists accept the price mechanism which speedily reconciles any imbalance between supply and demand. The macroeconomy is the sum of all markets and should therefore be more or less in equilibrium. The great French economist Jean-Baptiste Say formulated this in one of the rare laws in economics : every aggregate supply creates a corresponding aggregate demand. The law definitely holds in a barter economy, because even if products or services are not consumed they are lent out to others who will use them. Hoarding purchasing power by keeping money to put under the matress is impossible... without money.<br /><br />Money makes it possible to have leakages of purchasing power because money received by selling goods or services is not spent. If money earned is not consumed it is by definition saved. Usually this would mean that these sums are made available to individuals or companies in need of capital so that savings are equal to investment. Any imbalance would be readjusted by a change in the interest rate. However, Keynes pointed out that saving is not necessarily synonimous with investment viz. that savings can be hoarded as money and that there are good reasons for doing so.

B000Y1ZXU2|5.0|I just bought this DVD about an hour ago. I was amazed at the quality of the video content wise. That is what i have expected with every other video of Tool since 2000 when  a friend told me about them and i gave Aenima a listen. Every since then i have been hooked. Adam Jones is truly a one of a kind sculptor and musician. Anyways back on to the video. If you aren't into bizarre stuff this isn't the DVD for you. Although i would have to say if you are open minded and a big Tool fan it is worth the money.The visuals are just acid trip like and so amazing you will be blown away. Best TOOL video to date in my book.    My only complaint about the video is there is no sound set up for 5.1 surround nor is the video presented in 16:9 Widescreen format. Aside from that i can live with it.

0143113100|5.0|The history of Sigmund Freud's approach to the mechanisms of the mind has exhibited some tumultuous changes over the past century.  Norman Doidge reminds us that Freud developed a thesis about the mind's plasticity over time.  Freud's psychotherapy - irrespective of some questionable methods - was designed to allow the mind to search within itself and change outward behaviour by identifying memories hidden or repressed.  However, after Freud, researchers using diagnoses of stroke or brain-injury victims, \\"mapped\\" areas in the brain for function.  The first of these was the speech-producing region now named Broca's Area, after Paul Broca, its discoverer in the mid-19th century.  Brain modularity, or \\"localization\\" as Doidge deems it, became the norm in brain research for decades following Broca.  In this fine account of the history or recent brain studies, Doidge addresses a new concept being used to both treat and train - brain \\"plasticity\\".<br /><br />Rewiring of the brain isn't a new concept.  Among the more famous examples of how the brain reacts to challenges from the rest of the body is the concept known as \\"phantom limbs\\".  Patients suffering amputations have complained of itchiness or pain seeming to emanate from the lost limb.  V.S. Ramachandran and his colleagues have described this phenomenon in detail.  \\"Rama\\" is but one of the researchers Doidge parades in a receiving line of innovative cognitive specialists.  One of his more noteworthy is Michael Merzenich, who Doidge declares is the \\"world's leading researcher in brain plasticity\\".  Merzenich followed the work of Wilder Penfield at McGill University in Montreal.  Penfield used electrical probes to map the regions of the brain to identify which areas produced specific reactions.  Penfield's work reinforced the consensus regarding \\"localization\\".  Doidge goes so far as to deem neuroscience as long dominated by \\"localizationism\\" - a form of dogma.  Merzenich, on the other hand used more refined equipment than available to Penfield, has made vast strides with closer detail.  His work also demonstrated that \\"lost areas\\" in the brain have their duties taken up in other regions.  The brain, he demonstrated, can \\"re-wire\\" itself - and in more than one way.  The brain, then, isn't dominated by genetically assigned \\"localizations\\".  It's \\"plastic\\" and able to change, through training or even using its own resources.  In a sense, Freud's original concept has been vindicated by recent research.<br /><br />Doidge follows the work of dozens of researchers who have revealed examples of this re-mapping activity.  They investigate how stroke patients can learn to use limbs rendered unresponsive.  The treatment seems bizarre - restrain the good limb so it will not replace the useless one.  In a short time, the unresponsive limb begins to respond as the brain is forced to seek new pathways.  Patient recovery has been almost spectacular, according to Doidge.  He stresses that the theme is \\"use it or lose it\\" throughout the book, but is especially true in stroke victims.  Where traditional therapy enhanced the capabilities of the working limb, brain plasticity demonstrates that recovering use of an affected limb should be favoured.  This new therapy can be successfully applied months, or even years, after the stroke event.  In this author's hands, these accounts read like a script for a car-salesman sitcom.  He may be correct in his views, but nothing in brain sciences is entirely positive, as history has demonstrated.<br /><br />There's more than just therapy in brain plasticity achievements.  In Asia, particularly Japan, babies are born with ability to form the sound for the letter \\"L\\".  Since Japanese doesn't contain any words with that sound, children lose the capacity to pronounce it.  A new programme, using slowly sounded words can actually recover the pronunciation in immigrants to North America.  The technique is an indicator of what Doidge refers to as \\"plasticity competition\\".  Although the brain appears to re-route signals throughout the brain simply during daily use, there is also the possibility of patterns settling in and resisting change.  Doidge refers to this as the \\"plastic paradox\\", and sees it as the way habits are formed and retained - even against good sense.<br /><br />While Doidge has provided a comprehensive look at how recent research has overthrown the notion of \\"one area - one behaviour\\", there are numerous questions remaining.  How does the mechanism work?  What triggers neurons to reach out to make new connections?  Is anything already in place displaced, or are idle synapses or dendrites now put to work?  Does the old notion of our using \\"only 10 per cent. of our brain\\" - an clich&eacute; long dismissed by neuroscientists - have some validity, after all?  Although two Appendices enlarge greatly on this overview - one on culture and another on \\"Progress\\", brain mechanics in this process remain obscure.  This shortcoming requires vast amounts of further research but in no way diminishes Doidge's accomplishment.  This book will remain a major element in the history of brain studies for some time.  Written for any reader who has a brain, the author deserves the fullest praise for his accomplishment.  The five stars is given a bit grudgingly, but this book requires the widest exposure possible.

0800141660|4.0|Good movie, but I recommend you read Jane Austen's book Sense and Sensibility first. The movie is not exactly like the book , but still enjoyable. I enjoyed Kate Winslet's performance. I thought Emma Thompson was too old to play this role..she's supposed to be 19 yrs old in the book, she looks like she can be Kate Winslet's mother. Hugh Grant does a great job playing Edward Ferrars. Overall a very good movie.

B00007L4MJ|5.0|(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \\"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\\" Get it at Amazon.)<br /><br />BEWARE SPOILERS<br /><br />Fritz Lang's futuristic Metropolis is set in as it happens something like the current era.  Most of the population are workers who slave underground to keep the massive machine that is the city going while the privileged stay above ground and live hedonistic lives.  It is impossible not to see this in Marxian terms, the prols exploited by the capitalist class.  At the time of the film's production in Germany, there was indeed a specter haunting Europe and it was indeed the specter of communism.  Curiously Lang ends the film with a blatant political statement.  He has labor and capital reluctantly shake hands.  I find this curious because there is little doubt that for the previous two and a half hours the film depicts the capitalist class in the person of Joh Fredersen (Alfred Abel) as seeing the workers as mere automations to be exploited.  I think Lang wanted to dodge the political implications of his film.  I think he was less interested in ideology than in showing striking visuals of man in the world of machines, of humans as machines themselves, and other humans more like brains without bodies, wet wear blind to anything but production and keeping the hive buzzing.<br /><br />Metropolis is like a hive or an ant colony except that the workers never get to go out and forage.  Their world is dark and steamy; they are for the most part without hope as they come and go with their heads bowed in submission.<br /><br />In another sense (and this metaphor is directly from the film) the workers are the hands of the body and the capitalists the mind.  Maria says, \\"Between the mind that plans and the hands that build there must be a Mediator, and this must be the heart.\\"  Maria is a prophet who predicts the coming of this Mediator, who one might, in all innocence, believe to be a nice stand-in for, say, Jesus Christ.  Politically speaking, then, perhaps what Lang is saying is that the war between communism and capitalism will eventually be mediated by the Second Coming.  Expressing this commonplace idea with striking visuals rather than speaking it in so many words, exemplified the power of the relatively new medium of the \\"picture show.\\"<br /><br />This is the first silent film I've seen in many years.  It's a bit over the top in terms of acting, which of course was deliberate since facial expressions and body language were used to replace words that would have to be read.  Modern audiences may find this convention comical or just weird.  I found the scenes showing the characters running at something like one and a half times real human speed a bit amusing.  I don't know enough about silent films to know whether that was deliberate or something Lang thought effective.  Gustav Frohlich, who has the male lead, in particular is a frenzy of action and contorted facial expressions.  Brigitte Helm, who plays Maria and her deadly clone (and the robot and the dancing woman as well) is even more over the top in her physical gyrations, but her performance stands out because there is nothing quite like it in filmdom, at least nothing that I have ever seen.  It is both the heavy makeup and her wild, demonic (and seductive) expressions that allow us to clearly see when she is the evil clone and not the demur, heroic Maria.  For me she was the most memorable part of the film.<br /><br />There is quite a bit of trivia and film history associated with this landmark film.  The film seen today is a 2001 reconstruction of the original, part of which has been lost.  The missing action is explained in text before going on to the next scene.  Metropolis was said to be Hitler's favorite film, which doesn't surprise me, and it was the most expensive film made up until that time, and employed a huge cast.<br /><br />But see this for Fritz Lang's stunning and hauntingvisuals, which remain even to this day as striking works of art.visuals, which remain even to this day as striking works of art.

B0018CA996|4.0|In the 90s, it was easy to know who Portishead was.  They were the ubiquitous trip-hop group, combining molasses-slow beats and turntable scratches with atmospheric accents, tied together by the siren singing of Beth Gibbons.  Ten years later, the group has an entirely new modus operandi, but it's not exactly the one that's expected.  On Third, the combination of growling guitars, damaged and detuned analog synths, clipped loops warring with overdriven drum machines and embarrassingly confessional lyrics that could have been ripped from a middle schooler's diary combine to make Portishead's analog to...  an NIN album?    Nine Inch Nails is actually something of a guilty pleasure of mine, so I don't really mind this new direction.  And, of course, if Third's closer \\"Threads\\" bears any resemblance to the infamous \\"Hurt\\", it's that song being sung by a chanteuse in a smoke-filled nightclub with a nuclear war being waged just outside.  Third would easily rank on par with NIN's finest, especially as it takes many risks that would probably be beyond the old industrial crowd.    Most important among these is the jolting sequencing, which constantly aims to prevent the listener from getting into any sort of expected groove.  Opener \\"Silence\\" starts with a wicked drum loop which fills most of the song, but it only finds its signature riff by the ending - a simultaneously mournful and beautiful guitar line roaming amidst the chaos - only to cut out abruptly in mid-phrase and segue into the underwater jazz of \\"Hunter\\", which similarly fades out just as it finds its rhythm and gets truly gratifying.  Then, of course, there's the jarring transition between the heavily industrial \\"We Carry On\\" and 30s doo-wop soundbite \\"Deep Water\\", which somehow manages to work perfectly despite being totally improbable.    There aren't many weak tracks on the album either, although I can see why a few (\\"Machine Gun\\" especially) might be grating enough to be skippable.  But Third works as an album - it's clearly one of those unified works that is becoming increasingly rare in the age of the mp3.  And no matter how different their sound, this is still unquestionably Portishead - the cinematic sound is still there.  You just have to look harder for it.

B000ICLRIE|5.0|I bought The Kingdom of Heaven (Blu-ray) only because I saw a brief scene from the film in a high-end HDTV electronics store. I had no idea it would turn out to be--in my opinion--a masterpiece of acting, dialogue, message, sound, and cinematography. The music is peerless or close to it. The only negative I have identified is the absence of credit to Edward Norton for his role as King Baldwin IV. Incredible communication through body language and vocal control surely should have placed him among the major actors of the film. A+
B0011HF6GE|1.0|I really love a wide variety of music types: Big Band, Blues, Bluegrass, Classical, indie, Jazz, Folk, Rock of all types...  This isn't one!!!  There are a couple of interesting tracks though, I sort-of enjoyed Blindsided and Creature Fear/Team but even those songs are pretty-much destroyed by his use of his falsetto vocals which make the lyrics almost unintelligible! I suppose, that may be an attraction that this guy has for some; but it doesn't work for me!  Now, for most listeners, even those who enjoy indie and folk, I really think this CD is going to have extremely limited appeal.  Well, all I can say is that you had better enjoy listening to someone trying to sing in his falsetto voice before you get this CD...  I have no idea of what his real voice sounds like...  I would like to know!  DO NOT BUY THIS!!!

0452289963|5.0|In responce to the few readers who have had difficulty in understanding this book and The Power of Now, I would like to descibe my own experiences. A friend enthusiastically refered me to read The Power of Now six and a half years ago. I got through the first chapter and my mind (read ego) said that we weren't going there (obviously, because it would mean the death of the ego) so I put the book on my book shelf, where it sat for two years.  Almost 5 years ago I went through a very traumatic emotional collapse, which was in my face constantly. After 4 months of this a very profound voice in my head said, \\"just surrender to the suffering.\\" That was it. No other explaination. So i did, and in 2 weeks I awoke to find myself free of all suffering and my mind chatter had completely stopped. It was a new life, full of all forgiveness, compassion, gratitude and peace. I realized that, even though I assumed that I was a very spiritual person, I was actually insane, and that most of what I thought was true wasn't.  In the Power of Now Eckhart describes this process as 'The Way of the Cross.\\" About a week after this profound event, the same voice came to me and said, \\"Now pick up The Power of Now and read it.\\" To my surprise, I realized that this book was absolutely true and that this death of the ego was what had happened to me. I continued reading the book and listening to the CDs on a daily basis to erase any tendency to revert back to my old self. Anyone who has worked on him/herself or gone to seminars knows this tendency.  A new Earth is a natural commentary on The Power of Now and is much easier to practice in this format, as it doesn't attack the ego so forcefully. As for the various people following this practice, yes, it does demand vigilance, as the ego is very powerful and cunning. We have identified with it for lifetimes, and it takes time to live life in the present moment. But I can assure you that if you continue with the practice, you will become more alive and full of love that emanates from within your center of being, that is completely independant of any exterior causes and emanates outwardly to everything without distinction of who is worthy of it. There is a profound peacefullness, joy and acceptance of whatever life (the present moment) presents to you.   I can understand why some people find this teaching troublesome to accept, as it begins the death of the ego, which is who we have identified with for as long as we remember. It's like a death of the self. But from the ashes arises the phoenix. From the caterpillar arises the butterfly.  I suggest to please give this book a try. The gift of awakening is so beautiful that there is nothing in this world that can even slightly compare.  As for me, my material situation (life story) isn't very pretty, as I have been on Kidney dialysis for 10 years and am forced to live on SSI ($637 per month). Yet my life is so full of love, peace and joy, that I'm full of gratitude for all that has happened to me and I wouldn't change it for any amount of money, health or other material circumstances.  Please allow this book to awaken you from the miseries that run your present life. Any criticism towards Eckhart Tolle is from not understanding what one is supposed to be when one awakens.  May God bless you on your journey, and may you be filled with the love and joy of who you truly are.
1576754499|4.0|An inspiring book that makes one think about the greater good that can come out of poverty eradication & how we can all be a part of it.    Criticism:    1. Author does not cover how he made the transition from being a psychiatrist to creating IDE. This makes it harder to understand how one can participate in this cause, even if one wanted to.    2. While the book is a great food for thought, it seems to be more focused on the destination rather than the journey. At times, it reads more like a journal which may be intentional, but this inconsistency gives the reader, a rather half baked impression.    3. Author's disagreement with major organizations such as the UN feel like a rant at times, as he only criticizes them without putting forth any concrete suggestions for bigger issues such as infrastructure (development of roads, bridges, dam development, power generation, healthcare & educational programs).

B00154GEFU|3.0|All right. I've read the reviews here. I've listened to \\"Phoenix\\" all week long. Now it's time for my two cents.<br /><br />I was nine when \\"Asia\\" debuted back in 1982, and I owned the cassette of \\"Asia\\" and wore it out. I followed with \\"Alpha\\" and \\"Astra\\" and \\"Live In Moscow\\" and \\"Then & Now\\" and then \\"Aqua\\" and \\"Aria\\". It was the four new tracks on \\"Then & Now\\" that soured me. They sounded cheap and just a shadow of the former Asia. \\"Aqua\\" and \\"Aria\\" were sub-par to say the least, and I have long since rid myself of everything but the first three albums. I have revisited the first three albums many times over the past 26 years, and I find them to be prog-pop classics.<br /><br />I am also prog-rock friendly owning all King Crimson, Genesis, Rush and most of Yes, and to a lesser degree, ELP.<br /><br />With all of this, I felt \\"Phoenix\\" was weak. Not terrible, but certainly not great. I felt Geoff Downes chose terrible sounding keyboards for this album. They sound like 80's rejects. I expected more from the man who gave us great keyboard work on \\"Video Killed The Radio Star\\" and \\"Only Time Will Tell\\". These keyboards sounded thin and squeaky. Where's Carl Palmer? Did he actually play on this album? His drumming sounded like anyone elses. For all I knew it could have been a session drummer. Steve Howe, where are you? I didn't hear anything that came close to the guitar muscle of \\"Heat Of The Moment\\" or \\"Wildest Dreams\\". John Wetton, well, I knew he was there, but the lyrics that he and Downes came up with--bland, bland, bland.<br /><br />The one notable exception is \\"An Extraordinary Life\\". We know what that song is about with all that Wetton went through last year, and the music matches the lyrics, making it probably the best song on the disc, certainly the most memorable one.<br /><br />I nearly tossed my cookies when I saw that there were two 8 minute songs here. I am a huge collector and listener of music, and all I could think of was how self-indulgent those tracks were going to be. Progressive rock is quite a dead art-form these days, and to be honest, I don't really need new progressive rock songs. I prefer the old ones. \\"No Way Back\\" and \\"Parallel Worlds\\" are just average progressive rock tracks, and they get really old after repeated listens.

B00005MCX2|5.0|..the 50p ticket was a bargain and it this album really does the performance justice.    Yes, I was a mere 14 years old when I saw them play at the Sunderland Locarno. This was strange, as I was living in Colchester at the time, but thats what family Xmas visiting is for.    Yes, these guys invented acid punk rock. They played with a tempo and energy which the Clash would have been proud of and this...show was extraordinary in its uniqueness. It was the first live show I ever saw and I don't think they ever surpassed this.    Lemmy's unique style of bass playing (which would later lay the foundations for Motorhead) glued this band together fundamentally. \\"Orgone Accumulator\\" is an example of how well Simon King and Lemmy understood each other.     I have listened to scores of live albums over the last 4 decades (indeed I bought Made in Japan two days before I saw Hawkwind play) and this is one of my  favorite 5 live albums.     More than worth a listen - its a pity no-one recorded and video-tape of this tour...

Consider that in 1869 a black man was nothing more than a freed slave, and would not have been granted such a task befitting John Steed or James Bond.  This is not a racist remark. Rather, it's the truth. Just like modern Hollywood to ignore history.  Nothing against Will Smith. He is a fine actor. I enjoy his work. However, through no fault of his own,  he is seriously miscast in this one.  I realize that Hollywood has a dramatic license, but please try to at least make sense.

B000YABYLA|5.0|Juno is the most enjoyable movie we've seen in years.  Every character was wonderful and we would recommend this movie to all!
015603283X|2.0|Oh! how I was desperate to like this book. Especially since it was my bathtub reading. And especially, especially since I was reading The Three Musketeers at the same time (as my nighttime reading). I just never got into the character of Corso as much as I'd have liked. Though the ending is alright, the middle of the book was too hard to get through--nothing dangerous, nothing interesting, only mildly intriguing, nothing that would make one to want to continue reading. I hope you like it more than I.

0142001104|5.0|Garr Reynolds in Presentation Zen recommended this book. It is a very useful and well written little book. Their web site , The Art of Possibility gives good background. Ben Zander is the long time conductor of the Boston Philharmonic and Rosamund is well respected change management professional. The book gives us very key insights into how to better understand our daily life and make something out of it all. Eg . Ben gives his music students an A at the beginning of each semester, but the students have to write an essay at the same time as if it was the end of term where they have to explain what they did to earn an A mark. I found each page had another insight for me and it was delight to go through the book. If you are into personal growth and development I would say this is a library keeper.
B000PMGNK4|3.0|Fits well with the series, though it can feel like little more than an elongated episode.  The DVD I ordered from Amazon was defective; however, Bandai replaced it without giving me any static.  If you enjoy the other movies and the 2 seasons this is a nice addition to your collection, but do not expect too much from this movie.

B000YABYLA|4.0|This movie may require you to suspend your beliefs.     You must believe: that a store clerks is pithy, that a teenager is even pithier, that parents are supportive of a teen pregnancy, that teens at school aren't cruel, that a teenage boy wants a meaningful relationship more than gratuitous sex, that a neurotic, uptight professional woman is good single mother material, that a man slow dancing with a teenager half his age isn't a predator, that people know when to enter and leave relationships, that teenage pregnancy has no long-term negative effects.     If you believe, you will be rewarded with a sweet viewing experience. But a cynic might say it would be appropriate if Juno woke up at the end of the movie.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This movie was funny i saw this long time ago and this was like jack frost all comedy no horror but exept jack frost did'nt have zombies. It's funny how they like to make fun of zombie movie's whitch is great cause it's like there saying oh people are getting board seeing the samething happening in zombie movie's so why don't we make it more fun and exciteing and that's what they did in this movie, this and dead and breakfest were the only two zombie comedy movies that came out, they should make more zombie comedy movie's but this movie was great and funny.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am in semi-good shape. I run 3-4 days a week, but I needed something besides cardio.  This is THE perfect video if you ask me.  Here are the reasons why<br />1) It is short enough that I can always get motivated to do it.  I always tell myself, \\"It's only 20 minutes. I can work out for 20 minutes.\\" (Even though it is slightly longer).<br /><br />2)I have only done the first workout, but I am really motivated to keep using this video because I want to be able to move on to the 2nd set.  I am dying to see what the 2nd round is like!<br /><br />3)The exercises are very \\"back to the basics\\".  I like this.  No fancy moves, just jumping jacks, squats, high knees, crunches-- oldies but goodies.<br /><br />4) Each workout is a short warm up and then 3 rotations.  I like being able to check things off, so I just tell myself, just make it through this one rotation, and then just 2 more and you're done! It breaks the video up into smaller segments, which makes it fly by.<br /><br />Although I wouldn't do this workout exclusively (there aren't any videos that I would), it is a great addition to my running, and I feel like I am finally doing something about getting toned!<br /><br />Oh, just a minor tip I learned: to make the push ups easier, but harder than doing them on your knees, you can use a exercise ball to put underneath your legs. The closer up to your midsection, the easier the pushups. As you get stronger, you can roll the ball closer to your ankles.<br /><br />UPDATE: I just tried routine 2 for the first time last night. I thought, \\"how much harder can it really be?\\" It really kicked my butt! The plank work and those plank jacks....killer! I am taking a day off to recover, but I'm already looking forward to doing it again because it is hard but short.
B000TEPED0|5.0|Guys....this is a must have. I got hooked on one of his songs and came looking for more. There is not a bad somg on this album. Lots of fun Gary Allen like songs, with a hint or two of George Strait and Randy Travis mixed together.    Anyhow....get all of the songs, don't get one and kick yourself when you love it and want more.
B00154GEFU|4.0|This offering from the 80's supergroup Asia picks up exactly where this lineup of the group left off, but progressing slightly to a more progressive sound (pardon the pun) than that on 'Alpha'. Alpha, their sophmore effort, spelled the first change in the band's material toward more mainstream themes. Their 3rd album, Astra, attempted an even more commercial sound than what was produced on the first 2 albums but lost a lot of the group's appeal.                                                                        Phoenix takes the more commercial lyrical leanings of the second album, Alpha and combines them with occasional samplings of the more progressive sounds that Geoff Downes incorporated into the third incarnation of the group. That incarnation used a vocalist named John Payne and the results were really spectacular on the albums Arena and Aura. Geoff Downes's keyboard style hasn't changed one bit, but bringing Steve Howe and the rest of the gang back have changed the sound to that of Alpha. This is somewhat a good thing, although I miss the sound of John Payne's voice.     My personal favorite album that Asia ever produced in any lineup is \\"Arena\\". That album was created by the 3rd incarnation of the group, which included Geoff Downes (keyboards) and John Payne on vocals as the core members. John Payne has a voice that is 100% more powerful and distictive than John Wetton's.     The content of Phoenix will please old fans maybe fans of their later material as well. Perhaps the original lineup augmented by John Payne would bring an ideal sound that would please fans of old and new Asia alike. Phoenix does not measure up to the original Asia debut album, but is better than the 2nd offering, 'Alpha'. Recommended more for hardcore fans. If you are a casual fan, you should start with the remastered Anthologia as it contains all of the songs from their first 3 albums plus B-sides and other rarities from the era, all in remastered format.

However, for the money and it being from Martha the perfectionist who runs a multi-billion dollar company, I would have liked a hardcover cookbook, and I expected to see more pictures of the cookies.  We eat with our eyes, and seeing a what a cookie looks like makes me want to make and eat it.  The few pictures in it look like they weren't even professionaly photographed.  The book overall just seemed to be low budget and nothing spectacular.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|Upon first listening, I heard great music that I wasn't expecting, so I was a little disappointed.  I loved the dark beats from the first two.  While this one has a few songs that are reminiscent of the original works, this collection is vastly different, yet still remains sounding just like Portishead.    Once I gave it the all important second spin, the spin without preconceived expectations of sound, I fell in love with this album.  It is a stunning piece of work.    To those of you who are complaining and saying that you can't see how anyone can listen to it more than once, I call you out and say that is your problem.  You HAVE to listen to it more than once.  This isn't active listening; rather, it is the CD you put on when reading a book, relaxing at the beach/pool, or just sitting on the couch staring at the ceiling with the candles lit all around you.  So once you change your expectations, you should love this gem.  If not, then that is just pure difference of taste.      But this is just a great record!
1401216676|1.0|This hardcover is the Star Wars Special Edition of comics. Brian Bolland destroyed a great comic by re-coloring it on his computer. The Killing Joke had that great 80s color palette that you can find in Watchman and some of the best Vertigo Comics like Sandman and Preacher. Bolland defaced a work of art. In his remorseless forward to the hardcover, he acts as the comic's success belongs all to him and not Alan Moore or John Higgins. Higgins coloring on Hellblazer and Watchmen are some of my all time favorites. Thank god Bolland didn't go in and destroy those with his computer too. Bolland's lack of respect is sickening. True fans are just going to have to keep waiting for a real hardback of The Killing Joke.[[ASIN:1401216676 Batman: The Killing Joke]]
B0010ZR160|5.0|It seems as though Boston has taken on a life of its own. Perhaps it is the fact that we are home to the indisputably best baseball, football and basketball teams but there is something else that intrigues the rest of the nation about Boston. Maybe it's the fact that those not from here find the accent intriguing, maybe they yearn for seafood right off of the boat or maybe its that the historic appeal of the city reminds us of our American heritage.<br /><br />But filmmakers now see Boston as an interesting location to highlight in films, as well. One need not think back any further than The Departed to have images of what Boston is all about: a sort of rough and tumble blue collar city with a set of characters that will never be forgotten. One might say that Boston has a way of never being gone.<br /><br />But what if one of Boston's own children goes missing? Does the same rough and gruff blue collar nature not care as much as suburbia? Or does Boston respond the same way as the rest of the country?<br /><br />Written and directed by hometown hero Ben Affleck, Gone Baby Gone, based upon a book by Dennis Lehane, is a rather decent film that focuses on a child gone missing and the resulting search and lengths that go into the case.<br /><br />The film stars Ben's brother Casey Affleck as Patrick Kenzie, a private investigator hired by the aunt and uncle of a young girl from Dorchester that has gone missing. Though Kenzie typically does not work these kinds of cases, he persuades his partner and love interest Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) to take on this case due to the emotional pull anyone would feel when a child goes missing.<br /><br />Kenzie and Gennaro are quickly brought up to speed about the case by Capt. Jack Doyle of the Boston Police Department and he grants his assurances that the PI's hired by the family to help out on this case will have the full cooperation of the Boston Police Department. The lead detective investigating the case for the BDP is Det. Remy Bressant (Ed Harris).<br /><br />Bressant at first seems hesitant about the entire operation that now has civilian PI's joining him in tracking down the potential kidnapper that has stolen the child. What Kenzie and Gennaro believe to have had happened is that a Haitian drug kingpin of the Boston area may have kidnapped the child due to the fact that the child's mother Helen McCready (Amy Ryan) may have scammed money from the drug dealer in a drug delivery deal gone bad.<br /><br />Though it seems at times that Kenzie and Gennaro are on the right track in terms of tracking down the alleged kidnapper, a series of unforeseen subsequent actions always seems to get in the way of their work.<br /><br />What finally comes about in terms of the resolution of the kidnapping certainly is quite unforeseen and is a well crafted and interesting twist to the rest of the story.<br /><br />Although the film is directed by Boston native Ben Affleck, it is unforunate that the rest of the cast at times seems to have missed the entire Boston accent. There are times when the accent seems spot on and other times in which the accent sounds nothing like what the accent of Boston truly is.<br /><br />The one thing that disappointed me about this film is that there seems to be a misconception that the Boston accent has an inherently built in propensity to throw in random profanities the same way as we might forget to pronounce our \\"R's\\" correctly. The language in the film seems to be a bit over the top and not overly necessary.<br /><br />Being from the Boston area, it was nice to see that a great deal of the film was in fact filmed on location and did indeed show several recongizable sites around the greater Boston area. The picture quality in this film seemed spot on and highlighted the neighborhoods depicted in the film brilliantly.<br /><br />Amy Ryan, who played the role of the missing girl's mother was a 2008 Nominee for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and rightfully deserved such a nomination. Ryan played the role of the oft strung out junkie mom quite well and seemed to embody the role that she was cast for nicely.<br /><br />Gone Baby Gone certainly is a film that warrants being watched and thanks largely due to the interesting storyline at hand is a rather riveting watch. The movie fits nicely into the premise that no matter what Bostonians might do, they always do it well.eemed to embody the role that she was cast for nicely.

0307265730|4.0|This collection of short stories is much more even and consistent than the author's prior \\"interpreter of maladies\\" and the characters more engaging in certain respects than 'the namesake'.  While Lahiri's dispassionate style is almost clinical, the emotion she feels for her characters & their predicaments comes through in her elegant prose.  While some of the plots can feel contrived at times, the best efforts here such as \\"Heaven-Hell\\" and \\"Unaccustomed Earth\\" are haunting and will stay with you for a while.
B000P12LWY|5.0|I was so impressed with The Tudors!! This series is well worth the watch and is hard to peal away from! Johnathan Rhys Meyers is not who I would pick for a physical match for Henry VIII but I can see why he got the part! He earned it! He is commanding,powerful,hot-headed and his masculinity is palpable!! With an excellant supporting cast such as Sam Neil and Jeremy Northam and beautiful,fantastic costumes,dialogue, music and cinematography this is a must see! A feast for the eyes as well as the mind. You will be glued to the set!! I can not wait for season 2 on dvd!!!
B00007FOMP|5.0|Using questions, gestures of friendship, and ghetto lingo, Marvin Gaye makes powerful statements against war, pollution, poverty, drug addiction, and government overreach.   The title track (\\"What's Going On\\") was a watershed in Vietnam-era protest music and for Motown Records. As Ben Edmonds's jacket notes explain, Gaye engaged in passive resistance (refusing to produce any more music) after Motown declined to release a single of \\"What's Going On.\\" Gaye won the stalemate and so, eventually, did Motown after the song became a huge hit, giving the label its last smash before it left Detroit for Los Angeles. Motown's corporatist conformity and move to the Sun Belt were emblematic of trends blowing through American culture, trends so eloquently criticized by Gaye throughout the CD \\"What's Going On.\\"   Gaye movingly articulates emotions of the bewildered man of G-d amid the Silent Majority. The overseas militarism and domestic caution of the 1940s and 1950s had crashed headlong into the counterculture and civil rights movements, sending people and institutions careening in all directions. Rising as a musical Martin Luther King, Gaye tried to pull the strands back together, using appeals to America's Christian heritage and our common humanity. The job was/is too much for any one man but Gaye left an imperishable testament that current and future generations would do well to absorb.   \\"What's Going On\\" the CD also displays notable worldly sophistication. \\"Inner City Blues\\" has the artist connecting hyper government spending and activity with rising taxes, shrinking economic prospects, and shorter physical life spans. (Give that man a Nobel Prize!).    \\"...No, no baby, this ain't living   No, no, no   Inflation, no chance   To increase finance   Bills pile up sky high   Send that boy off to die...\\"   Gaye implores America to get back to long-term thinking. Less than two years after the 1971 release of \\"What's Going On,\\" the U.S. Supreme Court declared all unborn childrennonpersons through its infamous Roe v. Wade decision. Surveying the ongoing abortion holocaust that has disproportionately impacted blacks (15 million black babies dead and counting), listening to \\"Save The Children\\" is eerie and deeply saddening (especially since Gaye's prophetic plea was ignored).   \\"...Live, live for life   But let live everybody   Live life for the children   Oh, for the children   You see, let's save the children   Let's save all the children...\\"  Driving home the point is a jacket photograph of the artist standing in an empty playground.  Besides peaceful tones and appeals to love in the tradition of Nat King Cole, the enduring appeal of Marvin Gaye's music is its overall hopefulness. What's the cure for America's meltdown? George Harrison called it \\"unfolding your love.\\" Others might refer to it as uncompartmentalized religion. Marvin referenced it as \\"Wholy Holy.\\"  \\"...Oh, Lord  We can rock the world's foundation  Yes, we can  Better believe it  Wholy holy together and wholy  Holler love across the nation...\\"
B0000089FS|4.0|Good \\"comeback\\" album/cd.  Homage to Honky Chateau's ML&MH & some other songs revisit his better period, although it would be a while before he did a good song end-to-end.  This is seen by most as hist first true step back up.
B0013J30XG|3.0|There was times during Speed Racer where I found it lame or dumb yet I never stopped being entertained by the supporting cast. The movie is faithful to the cartoon series a few different ways. It's lively with fast talking and a cast that does the characters justice. Emile Hirsch has the right look for Speed Racer and isn't bad here but the supporting cast out shines him. Matthew Fox (Lost, Vantage Point) is surprisingly perfect as Racer X. A mysterious racer who wants to help Speed bring down crooked promoters. While John Goodman does some of his best work in awhile as Speed's father. You believe his love for racing plus watching him fight was actually hilarious. Christina Ricci is super cute as Speed's girlfriend and is well casted as well. While Scott Porter (Friday Night Lights, Prom Night) does fine work as Speed's older brother Rex in flashbacks. He was a great racer that Speed grew-up wanting to be like. So I liked the cast a lot, hell even the monkey in the movie is great lol. The kid who plays Speed's younger brother is a little annoying though I have to admit even if he gets some laughs as well.<br /><br />  So if anyone hates this movie I doubt it will be because of the cast. I just found the two fight scenes more entertaining than any of the racing. The effects are eye popping yet I wasn't impressed for some reason. It felt like I was watching Spy Kids 3-D again. I actually would've preferred if the directors took a different approach with the look of the race tracks. A Speed Racer movie actually didn't need so much CGI. It's fine how colorful it looks with the costumes and everything else though. Plus again, the cast was excellent. I just found the effects to be over-done and the direction to be over-done as well. The script is actually a well done good script for a Speed Racer movie. It's just the over-stylized direction that gets boring after awhile. The movie would've been better if they relaxed and just let the actors alone do their thing.
B00005MP58|5.0|I love this adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. I never liked Colin Firth before I saw this 5 hour miniseries, but now I love him, too. He played Mr. Darcy to perfection. Jennifer Ehle is very good also, as Elizabeth. I love that the screenplay stays very close to the book, both in dialogue and sequence of events. Not the case in all Pride and Prejudice adaptations. It doesn't feel 5 hours long. I've watched it more than once in the same day. A little extreme, I suppose, but I do love it that much. Not to take away from the Keira Knightley feature film at all, which is also very beautifully done and well acted, but this is the quintessential adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.
B00003CXAT|5.0|\\"Jurassic Park\\" has always been one of my favourate films ever since I was a child. Excellent direction, good editing and a well chosen cast makes the film worth a watch. The film hasn't lost its spice in all these years, its entertains me today as much as it did then. I had always wanted the movie on Dvd and finally glad to get it. The dvd is perfect with great picture quality and sound and has some interesting features like 'the making', etc. In other words, if you loved \\"Jurassic Park\\" wholeheartedly, this is the Dvd for your collection.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I watched this series on PBS in the seventies and was forever hooked! there has never been such a definitive work done on world war two as this, nor do I expect there will be in the near future. Sir Laurence Olivier's subperb narration guides you through almost every aspect of the most defining period of the twentith century.You can never grow weary of viewing this fine production as every time you view it, you will surley pick up on something you missed on the last viewing! All real, no phoney reenactments. A never ending history lesson.
B00005JPSM|4.0|This is a movie with humor, pathos, and romance.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is great as the perfectionist chef, Kate, and Aaron Eckhart is charming as her costar in the kitchen.  Abigail Breslin as the orphaned niece is very believable. This movie reminded me of An Unexpected Life, in which Stockard Channing is unprepared--but still forced--to take in her sister's children and then falls in love with them as she realizes the inestimable value of the children.  A more humorous version of this story line is Baby Boom with Diane Keaton, which is completely delightful.  No Reservations allows Kate to find out that there is more to life than being at the top; family is what makes success worthwhile.  My only disappointment is in the DVD's feature--an episode of Food TV's \\"Unwrapped,\\" about this movie.  Would rather have seen the usual commentary about how the movie was made.
B000005J08|5.0|Note: This album is from [[ASIN:B0006UYOMO The Complete Studio Recordings]].<br /><br />Although Naked City has more to their discography, and worth checking out (get it with the other albums in the complete studio recordings), their debut, is worth owning even if you don't want the rest of their discography (kind of easy to understand if you ask me).  Easily the most fun John Zorn album I have ever heard, the band tackles different styles with ease and can easily move around each with even greater ease.  And when Naked City is soft, unleashed, leashed, mysterious (you'd think that from the Chinatown theme song), fun, jazzy, you name it!!!  If it happens to not have something you like, life gives you lemons sometimes.<br /><br />This album is consistent, fun, and all varied with the many moods of music.  This album goes by pretty fast for me, since there is always something that catches you.  Out of all I've heard of the band playing, the debut is their best playing, ever.  John Zorn's blasts of saxophones are focused and add the all of the chaos, beauty, style, suaveness, who knows?!  He hardly is the focus, as every player on here, in a phrase, is the ______.  Fred Firth and Joey Baron are insane on the rhythm, doing everything they can to the best of their abilities, resulting in some excellent music.  Wayne Horovitz plays crazy cool piano, how does he get that tone in the beginning of The Sicilian Clan?  Bill Frisel is a monster guitarist, playing licks, sweet walls of dissonant melodies, soulful playing, and monster noises to back up Zorn, and more!  Perhaps a bit cliched when describing the people, but I am not really a very creative person, despite my love for creativity in general (hey, the same thing is boring, alright?!).<br /><br />There is plenty of songs on here to satisfy your musical thirst, regarding if you like the genres being played here.  The hardcore pieces are tight, well focused, and don't feel any dated. and Eye is one insane vocalist, that scream on Demon Sanctuary is priceless.  The theme songs on here deliver the goods, so if you like the theme song, you will mostly like that.  I even like the Ornette Coleman cover better than the original!  Campy tunes like Batman and James Bond? How could you argue with that?  And there's more!<br /><br />Though it would be harrowing to listen to for anybody who doesn't like this kind of music (yes, all of you idiots who are reading this, get out of here, stop trolling, and get a life), it's worth getting, this is essential.  And in my eyes overall, it's the best Naked City release, period.  If you know you are into this kind of stuff, then it's an essential purchase. And if you are new to John Zorn, this isn't a bad starting place. If you don' tlike it, don't feel bad at all.  Ignore all the music snobs.<br /><br />10/10is priceless.

B000A7DVR2|5.0|I do not understand why this film was not a bigger hit when it was released initially.
B001152TL6|5.0|My favorite of all David Lynch's films, \\"Lost Highway\\" isn't a film for everybody.  It's a dense and complex creepshow with many of the same elements that made \\"Twin Peaks\\" \\"Blue Velvet\\" and \\"Mulholland Drive\\" so rewarding to watch.  And, like those projects, \\"Lost Highway\\" demands patience and a willingness to forego a traditional linear narrative to gain access to the beautiful, brutal, and disturbing worlds that Lynch creates on film.  You have to open up your mind and just go with what's happening onscreen, otherwise you'll be hopelessly lost and/or frustrated. By the end of the movie, you'll either be enlightened or you won't, but it's a helluva ride anyway.    In \\"Lost Highway\\", Bill Pullman does a brilliant reversal of his often bland, reassuring screen persona, performing the role of Fred, a cuckholded, middle-aged saxophonist living an unhappy American Dream with his sexy, faithless wife, Renee (well-cast Patricia Arquette as an auburn haired vixen).  Fred's dream becomes a nightmare when he discovers that someone is apparently coming into his home and filming him and Renee as they sleep. After meeting a particularly creepy Robert Blake at a party, things go downhill quickly.  Following an almost Kafkaesque chain of events, Fred finds himself accused of a particularly horrific murder.  Tried, convicted, and sentenced to die, he finds himself locked in solitary confinement in a prison that seems to have no other inmates.  The only others present are two guards (one played by musician Henry Rollins) and an elderly doctor.  After experiencing severe headaches and convulsions, Fred awakens in the cell as Pete (Balthazar Getty).  Dumbfounded as to how the much-younger Pete awakened in Fred's cell, the authorities ship Pete home to live with his biker parents.  Back on the job at the auto mechanic shop, Pete meets up with an aging gangster (wonderfully played by Robert Loggia) and is introduced to Alice, the gangster's mistress (also played by Patricia Arquette--this time as a blonde kewpie doll). Suffice it to say, it isn't long before Pete is slinking around with Alice in back-street motels, and you know that the gangsters aren't far behind.  Carnage ensues, with some erotic layovers for the lovers, before a bizarre, beautifully filmed finale in the desert.     Aside from the expert performances and the gorgeous, haunting cinematography that has become a Lynch trademark, the soundtrack really stands out--it's probably the best of any of Lynch's films.  I recommend \\"Lost Highway\\" for film lovers who aren't hidebound in their viewing tastes.

These stories are well written and keep you entertained again and again. We usually fight over who will the read the next book first. We highly recommend these books.
B000063Y8F|5.0|I had some really bad luck with garlic mashers in the past.  The common flaw would be that they were either difficult to clean or eventually the handles would break.  The Rosle garlic masher has to be the best one that I have ever used or seen.  First off this thing is solid and will not have any problems mashing garlic.  It's also sturdy and is definitely high quality.  The best part about it is the cleaning.  It's difficult to describe but the screen that mashes the garlic splits apart and allows direct access to remove garlic pulp.  It makes cleaning easy and quick.  This caused me to throw away all of my cheap kitchen utensils and switch over to Rosle on almost everything.
B000UBMZ4S|4.0|This is a review of the HD-DVD Blade Runner Final Cut only. To put it in prospective I have the Laser Disk and the Director's Cut on DVD.    If you have an upscaling DVD player then there is not too much visual improvement to the orginal Director's Cut DVD. What has really improved is the Dolby 5.1 sound. The improvement in the sound quality in the regular Director's Cut to a HD-DVD,Blu-Ray, Regular DVD Final Cut is great.The opening scene when the ships pass over the city, first from front to back L, then from back to front,R, are grealty improved in rear sound quality.    Your ears will feel the diference.
0743496736|3.0|I hate being one to put a mediocre review amongst all the 5-stars out there, but I just have to.  This book was an enjoyable read and had an intriguing plot taken right from the headlines.  I give Picoult credit for her ability to make me want to read her books.  However, with that said, I must share a few complaints.<br /><br />Everything about this book seemed to be in excess.  First of all, I was bored stiff reading over and over and over again about how Peter suffered at the hands of the other students.  Honestly, I got the point of how serious it all was after the first 50 pages were spent on it, but it just seemed to drag on and on.  At least 100 pages could have been cut from this novel, which was entirely too long.  Don't get me wrong, I love a long book, but there's a difference between a long story and filler pages.  There was a bunch of random background information about Josie as well, that we didn't need to know.  I know the plan was to get the reader to feel as if they really knew the characters, including their deepest, darkest secrets, but it was just overdone.<br /><br />And my final complaint, the high school popularity scenario was overly stereotyped.  I've been in high school more recently than Picoult, and it shows.  Sterling High School's students were taken straight from the stereotype, where the nerds were bullied, the jocks were evil jerks who controlled their women and attacked the innocent, and the popular girls were cruel to everyone else, including their so-called friends.  Although I do think every high school has certain elements of this stereotype, I have never been exposed to one where it was exactly like that.  I feel sorry for any person who did.  Just a little bit of an overkill and kinda took away from the plot for me.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Read it if it sounds interesting to you, but don't be afraid to skim pages as you get into it.  There's no need to read every word and ponder its meaning because a lot of the narrative doesn't amount to a hill of beans in the end.  I would caution those readers who dislike \\"wordy\\" novels to stay away from this one.of beans in the end.  I would caution those readers who dislike \\"wordy\\" novels to stay away from this one.

B0014Z4OQG|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />You sure gotta' give those New Yorkers props for resilience.  If they aren't doing battle with space aliens, a bio-engineered plague, or a global warming-inspired ice age, they're fending off some nondescript creature that's come out of nowhere to lay waste to large sections of Lower and Midtown Manhattan.  And, indeed, after \\"War of the Worlds,\\" \\"I Am Legend,\\" \\"The Day After Tomorrow,\\" and now \\"Cloverfield,\\" one begins to wonder just how much abuse one little island should be expected to take before finally crying uncle.<br /><br />Blending the content of \\"Godzilla\\" with the style of \\"The Blair Witch Project,\\" the makers of \\"Cloverfield\\" relate their story entirely through the use of a handheld camera, as a group of twenty-something friends have their cocktail party rudely interrupted by the sudden appearance of a monster capable of tipping over skyscrapers and squashing cars as if they were bugs.  The movie follows a remnant of partygoers as they wend their way through the smoky chaos of the ruined city, with one of them recording the horrors and devastation on a camcorder as he goes.<br /><br />Despite having a relatively low budget for a film of this type, \\"Cloverfield\\" does a remarkable job in blending CGI graphics with home video technology.  It may be true that the inky blackness of the nighttime setting helps to cover a multitude of special effects sins (some viewers may be frustrated by the murky indistinctiveness of the monster itself), but, on the whole, director Matt Reeves, cinematographer Michael Bonvillain, editor Kevin Stitt, and a team of highly talented FX and production artists are to be commended for achieving so much with so little.<br /><br />The advantage of the you-are-there approach that the filmmakers have adopted is that it makes the audience feel more a part of the actual event than if the story were given a slicker, more conventional presentation.  Suffice it to say there's no Will Smith here slapping on a flight suit and zooming off into the wild blue yonder to duke it out mano-a-mano with the creature and singlehandedly save the world.  These are ordinary, average people caught up in extraordinary circumstances, and it`s no coincidence that much of the imagery is clearly intended to evoke memories of 9/11.  After all, a world where post-apocalyptic paranoia runs rampant is no place for conventional action heroes.  Therefore, the verisimilitude of the piece is greatly enhanced by the use of relatively unknown players in the key roles (Michael Stahl-David, Jessica Lucas, T.J. Miller, Lizzy Caplan, Odette Yustman, Mike Vogel).<br /><br />The disadvantage of this 1st person-restricted approach is that it occasionally leads to repetitiveness in the storytelling, with even the gimmick itself threatening to wear out its welcome quicker than the monster himself does.  The narrow focus is also liable to drive some viewers crazy by not providing any kind of resolution or explanation to neatly wrap things up at the end (to me, this is a strength rather than a weakness).<br /><br />Finally, theatergoers who were rendered nauseated by the nonstop bobbing-and-weaving camerawork on the big screen should know that the effect is much less vomit-inducing when viewed on TV.<br /><br />The characters and their relationships may be no more than mere window dressing placed at the service of the story, but that really doesn't matter, for in the case of \\"Cloverfield,\\" the filmmaking itself is the star.ld blue yonder to duke it out mano-a-mano with the creature and singlehandedly save the world.

B0016HNOXQ|2.0|I was hugely disappointed as I listened to this album from the beginning to end. This third album elicits no emotion other than indifference and there is not one song that I can truly say I enjoyed. I was so excited when Portishead finally released another album, as I am a big fan of the first two. Some die-hard fans may disagree with me, but I don't think one will find the sensuality of \\"Glory Box\\", the languish of \\"Sour Times\\" and the melodic beauty of \\"Mourning Air\\" on this album. The music here is \\"listenable\\", but nothing to write home about. All of it is too experimental and chaotic for my taste. I hope Portishead goes back to their original style, which mesmerizes and holds the listener captive. I am positive they are capable of more than they delivered with \\"Third\\".
B000FZET5W|5.0|Like a lot of Prestige \\"albums\\" recorded in the pre-LP era, Thelonious Monk & Sonny Rollins actually a mishmash of various sessions and leftovers tossed into one (very brief) package. There are three Monk albums on Prestige -- this one, The Thelonious Monk Trio, and MONK; each one draws from multiple sessions, and several of the sessions overlap across albums. (This is also an album with Monk's Christmas Eve 1954 recordings under Miles Davis's name.)    This album is noteworthy for featuring two different occasions on which Monk teamed up with then-up-&-coming tenorist Sonny Rollins. Though Monk's other saxophone partnerships -- the long-term one with Charlie Rouse, and the short-term one with John Coltrane (can't forget Johnny Griffin either) -- get more notoriety, he and Rollins meshed very well. They'd reunite on Monk's Brilliant Corners (on Riverside) and Rollins's Volume 2 (on Blue Note). Though Rollins isn't quite at his mid/late-50s peak, he plays exceptionally well here. This is definitely some of my favorite pre-1955 Sonny.    The first two tracks come from a 1954 quartet session. I have to emphatically disagree with one of the other reviewers about this music being substandard. On the contrary, \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" is an absolutely superlative performance, and \\"I Want to Be Happy\\" is close behind. Sonny is just on fire here. It's true that Monk takes a relatively back-seat role compared to his work as a leader, but Spheroids can rejoice in his fascinating comping and an inspired solo on the 2nd track.    The fifth track comes from a 1953 quintet session, with Julius Watkins joining in on French horn. Their low rumbling on the goofy theme of \\"Friday the 13th\\" is great. The sound on this session is poorer than the quartet session (Van Gelder didn't engineer this one). Rollins doesn't match his playing on the 1954 recordings, but still plays very well. Watkins's French horn (muted, I believe) produces a sound somewhere between a trumpet and a trombone.Monk's solo is terrific. Near the end Sonny and Julius trade bars, with Monk joining as a participant after a few exchanges.    Then we have tracks 3 and 4, left over from one of the component sessions of The Thelonious Monk Trio (the same session that debuted \\"Blue Monk\\"). \\"Work\\" is indeed a classic and overlooked Monk tune, but \\"Nutty\\" is equally good and has a really nice Art Blakey solo.    If you're fan of Monk and/or Rollins this album is absolutely essential. Whether you get it in this form, or as part of the Complete Prestige Recordings box (which might make more sense from a budgetary standpoint-- the Prestige albums are all ridiculously short), get it. Monk did some of his best work for Prestige.    [This review is based on the 20-bit K2 remaster, which has excellent sound and an identical tracklist.  I have not heard the RVG reissue.]
B000YAA68C|5.0|I've just finished watching \\"PS I Love You\\" for the second time, and once again I've went through half a box of kleenex.  I'm not just giving this movie 5 stars because I'm an avid fan of Gerard Butler because he has other movies I'd never rate as high as this one.  There is not much I can say that has not been said already.  The movie is very real.  Hilary's performance really brings the emotion home because she is very sincere.  The scene near the end when she goes running into her mother's bar sobbing, and she says, \\"I can't breathe,\\" well- by that time I myself had to remember to breathe because when I cry I tend to hold my breath and I had been sobbing for a good few minutes already.  I was lost in her pain and heartache.  I forgot it was only a movie.    I LOVE this movie.  Gerard was wonderful and refreshing.  He mixes passion, romance and silliness is a way that is fun, believable and not over the top.      Sentimental but funny... I have never cried so hard from a movie.  There is something about the chemistry and dynamic between Holly and Jerry that made me sit back and ponder my own relationship.  Not perfect but wonderful in its normalcy.  A few lines from this movie could have come from my life, especially when Jerry during karaoke says something like, \\"She's already bitched at me for wanting to go out tonight... 'it's been such a long day at the office, ah...' \\"  It is a movie for me to watch often because it makes me realize how much I have to be thankful for- and to cherish what I have.  Sometimes we tend to take for granted the everyday stable yet great people in our lives, and I think for some of us this movie will work as a gentle loving reminder.

It's a little slow at times but diffently nice to see this talented group back together.

B000002VSN|5.0|I think that Whitney's musical performances in THE PREACHER'S WIFE are among the very best of her career. Most people have never heard her sing gospel unless they caught her and her mother, Cissy, singing on different music award shows (where they blow everyone away!) I think that MUCH of the material on her albums is soulless mush and power ballads that don't give her the opportunity to sing with real conviction. This soundtrack is an exception. It really let's us hear just what Whitney is capable of when given music that is as special as her gift. And that's true with the gospel numbers and ESPECIALLY on \\"I Believe in You and Me\\" - a beautifully written song performed with grace and maturity.   Another example of what Whitney can do when given great material appears on an album dedicated to songs written by Curtis Mayfield; again, her instincts are right on target and she does a phenomenal job. Maybe she needs to get rid of Clive - get a mentor/producer/whatever who will bring better material to Whitney and allow that incredible voice to soar.
B000002UZ4|4.0|Functioning exactly as its title promises, \\"Discography\\" covers the singles released by The Pet Shop Boys in the span from 1985's \\"West End Girls\\" to 1991's \\"Was It Worth It.\\" While in England, they ran up a string of hits worthy of superstar status, in the US, their run of chart luck ended with 1988's \\"Domino Dancing\\" (from [[ASIN:B000002UTK Introspective]]). Perhaps it was their very dry British sensibilities, maybe it was homo-phobia, but listening to this set from start to finish really does make you wonder why these great singles failed to find a home on American Radio.<br /><br />Granted, the early singles are the epitome of what made new-wave radio in the 80's a blast to listen to, and \\"What Have I Done To Deserve This\\" is both a classic song AND resurrected the late Dusty Springfield's career, but you can hear Pet Shop Boys growing in sophistication from the snide ennui of \\"Opportunities\\" (from the debut, [[ASIN:B000002U9K Please]]) to [[ASIN:B000002UWL Behavior's]] look back of \\"Being Boring.\\" They were bold enough to try all sorts of styles (from Trevor Horn's bombast on the great \\"Left to My Own Devices\\" to the heartbreak of \\"Being Boring\\") and were certainly not without their sense of humor. Despite constantly being labeled as dry or droll, making a medley out of Frankie Valli and U2 (\\"Where the Streets Have No Name/Can't Take My Eyes off of You\\") makes not only for a smashing dance record, but for a darn good musical in-joke.<br /><br />Although \\"Discography\\" has since been updated to [[ASIN:B000I2ISGS Pop Art: The Hits]] and includes songs from the PSB masterpiece [[ASIN:B000024QML Very]] on, this single disc retrospective is as essential to understanding 80's pop as would be [[ASIN:B000002MVM The Best of New Order]] or [[ASIN:B00000DG1R Duran Duran's Greatest]].

0618918248|3.0|Book Review<br /><br />The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins<br /><br />Richard Dawkins is a learned and eloquent writer. He knows his subject area fairly well, but he is naive or lacks sophistication when it comes to religion or theology. Like a number of atheists who have preceded him, he makes several valid points about historical Christianity and other forms of religion. However, much of Dawkins' presentation in The God Delusion is unprofessional, dogmatic, logically fallacious and unscholarly. With the limited time that I have, I would like to discuss a few problem areas of his book.<br /><br />First, Dawkins hastily and uncritically asserts that the Gospel writer Luke errs when he writes that a census happened in the days of Governor Quirinius. While it admittedly is not that easy to unravel the historical difficulties that revolve around the account in Luke 2:1-3, a reasonable person would admit that we do not have enough information to make an educated decision regarding Luke's much debated speech act. As Daniel Wallace suggests, the account resists simplistic interpretive reductions. But one does not have to conclude that Luke made a historical mistake. Especially is this the case in view of the many other historical details that Luke reports accurately (Luke 3:1; Acts 11:27-30; 16:11-15; 17:6; 18:12-16; 28:7).<br /><br />Dawkins is also good at attacking straw men such as certain aspects of intelligent design theory. For instance, on page 132, he puts words into the mouth of an \\"imaginary\\" intelligent design theorist. Dawkins makes this \\"imaginary\\" intelligent design theorist say that serious inquiry regarding how nerve impulses work or how memories are made in the brain ought to be avoided. Rather, all such phenomena must simply be attributed to God. But is this the position of intelligent design theory? No it is not. This form of intelligent design theory only exists in the imagination of Dawkins. But this straw man argument illustrates the modus operandi of our author.<br /><br />To quote William Dembski:<br /><br />\\"For the scientific community intelligent design represents creationism's latest grasp at scientific legitimacy. Accordingly, intelligent design is viewed as yet another ill-conceived attempt by creationists to straightjacket [sic] science within a religious ideology. But in fact intelligent design can be formulated as a scientific theory having empirical consequences and devoid of religious commitments. Intelligent design can be unpacked as a theory of information. Within such a theory, information becomes a reliable indicator of design as well as a proper object for scientific investigation.\\"<br /><br />On page 133 of his work, Dawkins quotes Judge Jones, who presents Behe in a negative light as does Eric Rothschild (chief counsel) who also uses arguments made of straw or caricatures to supposedly defeat \\"Professor Behe and the entire intelligent design movement\\" since they allegedly \\"are doing nothing\\" to advance scientific or medical knowledge. However, Behe has offered a response which one can find at the website Uncommon Descent. In part, Behe's response states:<br /><br />\\"The Court's reasoning in section E-4 is premised on: a cramped view of science; the conflation of intelligent design with creationism; the incapacity to distinguish the implications of a theory from the theory itself; a failure to differentiate evolution from Darwinism; and strawman arguments against ID. The Court has accepted the most tendentious and shopworn excuses for Darwinism with great charity and impatiently dismissed arguments for design.<br /><br />  All of that is regrettable, but in the end does not impact the realities of biology, which are not amenable to adjudication. On December 21, 2005, as before, the cell is run by amazingly complex, functional machinery that in any other context would immediately be recognized as designed. On December 21, 2005, as before, there are no non-design explanations for the molecularmachinery of life, only wishful speculations and Just-So stories.\\"<br /><br />Many other examples could be given of the propaganda found in Dawkins' book. Those with open minds may be able to see who is deluding who.Many other examples could be given of the propaganda found in Dawkins' book. Those with open minds may be able to see who is deluding who.
B000E5N684|5.0|For the few extra minutes of footage, and the bonus features (to see Stone's real audition is worth it alone, it had to be her) take the cake. The movie is still engaging after all these years, it's a mighty fine erotic thriller. The Directors Cut generates even more heat! Whew...

0618918248|2.0|I was stuck at the airport for five hours with nothing to do, so I bought this book.  The main selling point for me was that Stephen Pinker, one of my favorite authors, endorsed it in comments on the inside cover. I was hoping it would help me understand or refute my beliefs--which is essentially that God doesn't intervene in the universe or reward or punish us with heaven or eternal damnation, and is therefore irrelevant--but unfortunately it didn't help.  I figured he'd give me his best shot in Chapter 4--Why There Almost Certainly is No God, but it was not convincing so I stopped reading. Maybe I missed something, but it seems that his primary argument about the nonexistence of God is that if there was, who made God?  A fair enough question, but an equally fair question is if there is no God, how is that there is a universe? I was hoping for a scientific discussion of how the universe could have been created without the interference of a god, but none was presented. That got me wondering why his views are so strong, to the point of zealous non-believer. Maybe he has some ax to grind. Overall, I was disappointed that the book did nothing to help me understand or better define my beliefs.
B000VT6FAO|3.0|I think it is a given that Dave Gahan's solo career isn't nearly as interesting as his career with his band Depeche Mode. PAPER MONSTERS was okay but the album didn't do anything for me. The music was just not memorable as anything the man has done with his band. His latest solo album HOURGLASS is somewhat better but the songs again aren't that I am going to remember in 20 years down the road. The first two tracks \\"Saw Something\\" and \\"Kingdom\\" definitely hearkens back to Depeche Mode in the '90s, maybe around the ULTRA era. I like the dark, sinister beats and Dave's vocals on those tracks. The one song that really rubbed me the wrong way is \\"Deeper + Deeper\\". I didn't like Dave's attempts at snarling. I didn't like the way his voice sounded. Songwriting has improved since the last solo album but once in a while, Dave's shaky songwriting skills shows like on the ridiculously pretentious \\"21 Days\\" and the atrociousness of \\"Miracles\\". I like the atmospheric music on \\"Miracles\\" but the lyrics was silly. HOURGLASS has its moments of greatness but ultimately it isn't going to be as memorable as any of Dave's work with Depeche Mode.
B0013J30XG|5.0|This WB release is packed with action, astounding special effects (mixing the real with the virtual) and intriguing story lines. Only because of all of these three aspects, it's worth a watch. It's a little children-focused, but entertaining for the whole family.<br /><br />It has not much to do with the innocence and the simplicity of the original Japanese cartoon series and this is one more reason fans of this character should see the movie - to judge by themselves.<br /><br />Basically, this is a story of a little boy who is born and raised by a family of car and speed lovers. They truly believe in the joy and in the real spirit of the racing. Along the way, they end up facing the tough reality of the sport business - competitors, results and championships are determined by the industry, the money men, by the interest of big money corporations. There's no such thing as fair results, authentic competition. Winners and losers are previously chosen before they even compete. Speed Racer's family is even led to believe that the loss of their oldest children by a car accident was caused by this called corporate greed.<br /><br />As Speed and his family are determined to bring the power down, proving that talent and the love for the speed are capable of anything that money just can't buy, mysteries unfold throughout the story and everything end up just fine. While some people might call this a predictable, boring and childish flick, I call it the best live-action movie of 2008 so far. Undoubtedly a five-star rating.
B0013J30XG|1.0|The above title refers to a line of dialouge from an excellent film \\"Trainspotting\\" that describes the protagonists' worldview of the mundane \\"fun-filled\\" activities that would otherwise occupy an addict's time to shoot up. This is precisely what you will get when what gets an O.D. In this case, it's sensory overload of the eyes, ears and mind.<br /><br />After the first two race sequences, I found myself nearly falling asleep during the film. Yes! Falling asleep in a loud, balls to the wall, movie! Bill Hunt of Digital Bits praised the movie to high heavens and he even disparaged the critics who had low opinions of this movie. Taking his comments with a pinch of salt, I went in to the theatre with low expectations. Looks like I need a salt shaker by the time the end credits were rolling with that silly chimpanzee behind the steering wheel.
B0008ENIAC|5.0|True Joan Crawford classic. I ordered this movie after seeing \\"Mommie Dearest\\", which I would also recommend.This movie won Joan Crawford an academy award and while I suspect (although I do not profess to be an expert by any means) that it was awarded more for her longevity in the business rather than for a specific stellar performance, this movie does not disappoint. It has a very interesting story line, particularly in light of the \\"Mommie Dearest\\" shadow on her relationship with her own adopted daughter. In the end I would call it a true glimpse of the previous generations' \\"chick flick\\".

About a year ago I found myself listening to them alot and decided to start buying their earlier (studio) CDs.  I started going backwards, one CD at a time, and recently got \\"Foxtrot\\".  I never heard any of the tracks before and was totally surprised to find my favorite Genesis song, Supper's Ready,a 23 minute song, on this CD.  I just keep playing it over and over again. I've never done that with any Genesis song. \\"Nursery Cryme\\" is next.

Also, to feel more loved yourself.
B00139W3NE|3.0|...well...i still have issues with the religious right that feel the books and the movie are based on atheism.  when will they take the time to read between the lines and recognize that pullman was writing about the religious dogmas that people take to far extremes to commit atrocities in the name of their god?  would they have been happier if the film was based in a middle eastern world, instead?<br /><br />having said that, i felt rather let down by the movie makers who watered down the story in order to get more people into the theatres.<br /><br />it was a decent film and i do hope that they decide to bring the rest of the trilogy to the big screen.
B0013J30XG|5.0|OMFG!  I also saw the movie on its first day in theaters especially in IMax (totally awesome!)  Speed Racer was wicked cool!  I can't wait to purchase it on dvd :D  For those who love action, wittyness, and art I suggest to those to watch this beauitful movie.

B0013FBS20|5.0|Great Movie I really like the way this story was told how it unfolded. The alternate ending was a cool twist to the story. But the one they went with was a better fit to the story. Im still amazed every time I watch a Blu-Ray on my LCD TV the picture is just so amazing.
B00005JPS7|4.0|The Good Things<br />*Smashing special effects and action scenes.<br />*Good, straightforward filming style.  A few scenes in the beginning had me worried, because they had some weird jumping camera effects, but most of the movie's style is slick and smooth.<br />*Very good, sleek production designs and costumes.<br />*Pretty good, straightforward story.  Contains a good mix of action, comedy, drama, and a smidgeon of romance.<br />*Good themes and imagery reflecting modern-day conflicts in the world, and the role major business play in it (a little similar to \\"Lord of War\\", but not as serious).<br />*Pretty good characters; pretty good acting.  In fact, the main character is better developed than I thought he would be.  Much of the story revolves around his evolution from a cold-hearted entrepeneur into an empathetic hero.<br />*Look out for Stan Lee's cameo, once again!<br />*Great sound effects.<br />*Awesome music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*One or two slow parts.  The really cool stuff doesn't happen until at least 30 minutes into it.  But it's still not too dull at all.<br /><br />Once you get into it, this is quite an exciting and slick superhero movie.  Much of the action and effects are quite memorable.  The characters are not too shabby.  The story has enough of everything to keep it engaging, even when there's nothing happening.  Moreover, it has some subtle elements reflecting modern-day issues (with terrorism and arms dealing), I would say that it is better.  It's still not extremely deep or profound, but is quite enjoyable, and would rank it as being better than \\"The Fantastic Four.\\"
B0013J30XG|5.0|\\"When I watch you do some of the things you do,\\" says Susan Sarandon in the Wachowski Brothers' \\"Speed Racer,\\" \\"you take my breath away.\\" This line pretty much sums up how I felt about the movie. \\"Speed Racer\\" is an absolute visual masterpiece, retooling the look of anime into an exciting, hyper-realized world of vibrant creativity. Every shot is like a cartoon brought to life, the neutral shades of the real world replaced with bold shades of red, blue, green, yellow, purple, and orange. It doesn't present us with a vision of the future so much as it presents an alternate reality, where racing tracks and cars defy gravity. Here's a film you have to see more than once for the imagery alone, because chances are you'll miss more than a few details along the way--every square inch of the screen is packed with visual delights almost all throughout. It isn't often you come across a movie this stunning, this lively, and this fun.    Based on the 1960s cartoon series created by Tatsuo Yoshida, \\"Speed Racer\\" puts it foot on the gas as soon as the Warner Bros. logo appears, interweaving the title character's back story with a heart-pounding race. Even as a young boy, Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) has known nothing other than automobile racing; now as a professional racer himself, Speed is haunted by the death of his big brother, Rex (Scott Porter), a racing superstar who crashed eight years ago on a cross-country rally. The public believed that corporate sponsorship changed Rex into a money-grubbing backstabber, forcing him to turn his back on racing altogether. Naturally, Speed and his family are now completely against sponsorships of any kind, especially his father, appropriately named Pops (John Goodman). For this family, it's about racing, not money.    Here enters Royalton (Roger Allam), a slick corporate mogul who tempts Speed with the fame and fortune associated with being sponsored. In essence, Royalton wants Speed to sell his soul, much like Rex sold his. Despite an impressive city suite and the top-of-the-line cars manufactured in a highly efficient factory, Speed refuses to make a deal. Royalton angrily lets him in on a little secret: Car races are always fixed because, contrary to what Speed was raised to believe, making money is what racing is all about. With the help of his girlfriend, Trixie (Christina Ricci), and a mysterious masked man known only as Racer X (Matthew Fox), Speed infiltrates a number of races in an attempt to destroy Royalton's reputation as well as the need for corporate sponsorship. This won't be so easy, though; numerous factions are in cahoots with one another, all of which connect with Royalton to some degree.    If this sounds absolutely ridiculous, keep in mind that plot is not what \\"Speed Racer\\" depends on. This movie thrives on imaginative digital effects and spectacular racing sequences, all of which rely on lightening-quick edits and creative camera tricks for maximum entertainment. In this completely fantasy world, racecourses look like oversized Hot Wheels tracks, with sharp inclined curves, completely vertical drops, gaps to jump, and a variety of loops. Speed and his beloved car--the Mach 5--navigate these roller coaster-like twists and turns with ease and accuracy, as one would expect from a cartoon adaptation. Cityscapes are colossal, brightly colored, and sterile, looking much like the Worlds of Tomorrow depicted in science fiction pulp magazines. The sunny sky is a deep, rich shade of light blue, and it's accented with puffball clouds that are pure white. On DVD, one could easily pause a frame of this film and stare at it for hours while absorbing every single detail.    Just as impressive are the side characters, all of which add a little something to the story. Speed's youngest brother, Spritle (Paulie Litt), is a loveable scamp who often stows away in the trunk of the Mach 5. Always at his side is Chim Chim, his beloved pet chimp; together, they act as the film's comedy relief. Speed'smother (Susan Sarandon) is a caring woman who can weld car parts after making a mean stack of pancakes. The family mechanic, Sparky (Kick Gurry), absolutely shines during a wonderfully cartoonish martial arts sequence, one that makes you laugh just as much as it makes you cheer.    In a nutshell, \\"Speed Racer\\" has set a new standard for digital filmmaking, a standard previously set by brilliant films such as \\"Sin City\\" and \\"300.\\" It's sure to snag Oscar nominations for visual effects, costumes, and cinematography, as well it should; watching this movie is an exhilarating experience, a perfect mixture of hard-driving action, childish whimsy, and visual creativity. The abundant imagery acts as a counterpart to Michael Giacchino's score, a cheerful opus that adapts the original theme song \\"Go Speed Racer Go.\\" But all this wouldn't have worked without the actors, all of which were perfectly cast. Hirsch makes the title character both determined and vulnerable. Ricci gives Trixie a wide-eyed innocence that I absolutely loved. Allam is deliciously evil as Royalton, a sniveling, conniving villain you just love to hate. Sarandon and Goodman are convincingly down-to-earth as the parents of a racecar driver. And I have to give a lot of credit to young Paulie Litt, who not only delivered some of the film's best lines, but also played his part in the spirit of good fun. \\"Speed Racer\\" was all in good fun, definitely one of the year's most entertaining films.

B000TGJ80S|5.0|Francis Coppola's DRACULA saga is an extravagantly nutso affair shot though with several terrible performances. (You know who they are.) But if you're going to have one really good performance in a vampire movie, it helps if it's from the actor playing Dracula. Gary Oldman is so much the life of Bram Stoker's Dracula that you the audience, unlike the characters in the movie, are safe only when Dracula is around.     Oldman's Dracula is by no means scary -- going for scary probably would have been futile and fatal -- but he is creepy, unpredictable, funny, sexy and compulsively watchable. Oldman succeeded in invoking the familiar, ghoulish Dracula with ease and wit, while at the same time evoking a new, modern, \\"F\\"-ed-up Dracula that has the kick of the unexpected. How difficult was Oldman's job? For starters, he was actually playing several different characters -- the medieval warrior; the crazed, debauched old man; the hairy giant bat; the seductive prince. That alone was potential chaos. But he also has a movie sliding off into silliness all around him. And he had gobs of makeup to contend with. You could see how the guy who became famous playing rock psycho Sid Vicious would have no problem handling this last challenge -- Oldman could act right through a brick wall, not to mention heavy prosthetics. How Oldman succeeded in keeping Coppola's sputtering blarney half-afloat is another matter.     Oldman seems to have thought a lot about how someone who has been pursuing a very bad habit for 400 years might feel and behave. On the one hand, the relic in the castle who unnerves Keanu Reeves is a combination of cheesy Bela Lugosi tribute and purely original strangeness -- as the terrifying razor-licking scene shows. The lethal geezer has the manners of someone who hasn't been out in public in a few centuries. On the other hand, the blue-spectacled fashion plate who fascinates Mina (Winona Ryder) is all seductive single-mindedness, with a subtle -- here's the key and the surprise -- vulnerability. The elegant prince has been consumed by a love since the fall of Constantinople -- and he has the gaze to prove it.     Besides giving Dracula a low voice and slooowww way of talking (why hurry when you've seen everything and you're never going to die?), Oldman paid special attention to his character's eyes. Dracula almost never blinks, telegraphing that, physically speaking, he doesn't have normal human needs, and metaphorically speaking, he can't be surprised or intimidated. The moment when Oldman does have Dracula blink -- when he sees the picture of Mina on Harker's desk, and later when he is with Mina and she is \\"remembering\\" his love Elisabeta -- are precisely when his ancient humanity has been aroused. Oldman also uses his hands to feed energy into his portrait of the \\"undead.\\" The old Dracula, whose palms are hairy (a good joke), does some fancy finger-waving that is complemented by a sort of bat-flapping of the arms when he gets ticked off. A great effect. The prince's hands are flawless, manicured instruments of seduction. Very sexy.     But these are just the specifics of a performance that is thoroughly thought out and fearlessly executed. And all within the confines of a basically terrible movie! With the whole enterprise of Bram Stoker's Dracula pitched so dangerously, and at points disastrously, toward extremism, it was something of a miracle that Oldman managed to resurrect a woefully picked-over legend with the strength of his own dramatic nerve.
B000077VR3|1.0|For people whose attention span can be measured only in nanoseconds, this movie must be a treat--a perpetual motion machine, never giving the viewer time to think, otherwise the poor soul might perceive what an emptiness it all is.  The generation who grew up on video games and MTV no doubt loved it (or did it move too slow for them?), but we over-40 dinosaurs found the kaleidoscopic nonsense a bit much, not to mention the tomfoolery of transplanting pop music standards into the Paris of 1900.  Granted, Nicole Kidman singing 'Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend' was rather amusing, but most of the songs were put over badly, and the attempt to mine humor from this--the foppish men singing 'Like a Virgin' comes to mind--failed to get a laugh out of me, sorry.  I rather like Ewan McGregor, but the poor chap was all at sea in this mess, and God knows he sure never be allowed to sing, ever, nor should anyone, under penalty of long imprisonment, be allowed to sing (or quote) Elton John's 'Your Song' on film, to the end of time.  (There are, heaven knows, hundreds of much better 'I really love you, baby' songs in the pop reportoire, and I don't think Sir (or Madame?) Elton needs any extra cash at this point.) Toulouse-Lautrec and his entourage were, I gather, supposed to provide some Three Stooges style comic relief throughout, but they were annoying as all get-out.  The movie gives the impression of being designed by a committee, with the members decided that huge profits could be repeated by combining two sexy stars (Kidman and McGregor), constant sexual innuendo (about as subtle as a wounded grizzly), songs that everyone was familiar with (whether the songs were good or not, or fit the historical period), loads of color and filters, and a spastic camera, topped off with a film editor who must've drunk a cocktail of coffee and speed (with a side dish of Ecstasy).<br /><br />Watching the very talented Jim Broadbent made me a little nostalgic for another (and a thousand times better) musical film in which he shone, Topsy-Turvy, with him as operetta composer William Gilbert (of Gilbert and Sullivan fame), in a movie that wonderfully evoked the late Victorian theatre world (and included some fabulous songs, of course).  Moulin Rouge did not evoke the Paris cabaret scene of 1900, rather, it put the scene on LSD and then set fire to it.  The 1952 John Huston film Moulin Rouge, though not a five-star classic, does a decent job of capturing that world (and, thank heavens, no horrible songs and off-key singers).  Maybe someone trying to buy or rent this 2001 bit of mess will, by accident, pick up Huston's film instead.) musical film in which he shone, Topsy-Turvy, with him as operetta composer William Gilbert (of Gilbert and Sullivan fame), in a movie that wonderfully evoked the late Victorian theatre world (and included some fabulous songs, of course).

B0015D3Z4O|5.0|She is one of the wonders of the world.  I won't bother listing her past accomplishments, because she has become the most famous woman in the world, so you already know them.  Her albums always deliver.  Her last two are as good as her first two, or better, depending on your point of view.  I can't think of any other long-term female artist about whom you could make this statement.<br /><br />This is a fun, upbeat album, like \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\".  But not a clone.  It has a very different sound, probably because Madonna always knows how to make her records state-of-the-art.  She worked with some very talented, high-profile collaborators, and the end result is that, just like 95% of the time in the past, she sounds awesome.  \\"Candy Shop\\" and \\"4 Minutes\\" have utterly fantastic beats for her to ride.  \\"Candy\\" is \\"sticky and sweet\\", and it features those vintage high-pitched Madonna vocals, just as \\"Heartbeat\\" and other tracks do.  As for the participation of Timberlake and Timbaland on \\"4 Minutes\\", it's all good.  In \\"Give It 2 Me\\", we have our girl stirring up the usual excitement (and trouble).  \\"She's Not Me\\" is very interesting lyrically - no low self-esteem here!  \\"Incredible\\" begins with a sort of mainstream adult contemporary melody beefed up by the muscle of technology, then morphs into very current pop.  \\"Beat Goes On\\" is a very appropriate title for track #8, because it continues a recurring theme of Madonna's - get up, celebrate, dance, holiday, etc.  And I love her yelling \\"Hey!\\" in the latter half of the track.  \\"Dance 2Night\\" reminds me vaguely of some disco sound, maybe Chic?  \\"Spanish Lesson\\" is a good track, and I really wish she would record a whole song in Spanish.  In the last 2 tracks, \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" and \\"Voices\\", good times are coming to an end as we hear themes of wickedness and madness, accompanied by serious, dramatic musical arrangements.  But of course, the beat is intact!<br /><br />In my review of \\"GHV2\\", in which I referred to that period as \\"the Clinton years\\", I said that hopefully we would get another volume from Madonna for the Bush years.

B000QUCNOU|5.0|The single most famous unidentified serial killer of the 20th Century, The Zodiac terrorized California with seven confirmed victims between 1968 and 1969 and numerous letters to area media--most specifically San Francisco newspapers--between 1969 and at least 1974.  No one was arrested for the crimes, which remain unsolved to this day.<br /><br />This would seem to place ZODIAC in the interesting position of being a mystery without a solution, but this is not really the case.  Like author Robert Graysmith, from whose book which it is largely drawn, ZODIAC strongly supports a particular notion about the killer's identity.  Even so, the film is actually less about the killer and his crimes than it is about the way in which a great number of people become obsessed with the case and how it impacts their lives.<br /><br />ZODIAC focuses on three men: reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) and editorial cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), both with the San Francisco Chronicle, and Inspector David Toshi (Mark Ruffalo) of the San Francisco Police Department.  In one way or another, the case seems to destroy the lives of those most particularly involved in its processes, and the film hands off its action and point of view from one man to the next until it comes to rest on Graysmith, whose obession with the case leads him to put his family at risk and places his marriage in jeopardy.<br /><br />Any one coming to ZODIAC with the idea that it will contain the same sort of jolts as such films as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS will likely be very, very disappointed: the violence involved is seldom graphic, the pace is very deliberate, and the film frequently raises tags that are never really resolved.  When ZODIAC comes to an end we know who Graysmith believes to be the killer, but there is no hard and fast proof one way or another, so there is no firm resolution.  If this sounds unfortunate, it is not: it is considerably more creepy than anything you might imagine.<br /><br />The performances are excellent throughout the entire film, the direction walks a fine line between being excessively low-key and over-extension, and the cinematography and art direction are memorable.  Although the original DVD release offers a handsome print, it is worth pointing out that it includes no extras of any kind--hardcore fans will no doubt prefer the double DVD \\"special\\" release.

B00139XZF4|2.0|It seems like anytime a movie becomes embroiled in some form of controversy regarding its content, actors, or whatever the case may be, the controversy surrounding the picture seems to have the opposite effect from what was initially intended by those opposing whatever it was that had caused the uproar. The reason for this is because the controversy catches people's attention and causes some amount of interest to be generated due to the public's curiosity about what is so controversial in the film; so instead of turning people away from the movie as intended, the controversy ends up driving many people towards it. Now, this is generally the case for many of the controversial films that Hollywood releases; however, sometimes this is not the case and the controversy actually serves the purposes of those that were upset by the film. The latter just so happened to be the result of the massive controversy surrounding the recent fantasy release of Philip Pullman's novel \\"Northern Lights\\" called \\"The Golden Compass\\" starring Nicole Kidman (\\"The Invasion\\"), Daniel Craig (\\"007: Casino Royale\\"), and newcomer Dakota Blue Richards.    \\"The Golden Compass\\" is the story of a parallel world of fantasy and wonder, where a young girl named Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards) is destined to hold the fate of the entire universe in her hands, as a powerful gift known as the Golden Compass is given to her to protect. As she begins to use the Compass more and more, Lyra discovers that her world and other world's beyond her own are being threatened by a dangerous woman known as Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman). With the aid of a heroic man named Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) and a misfit group of allies that includes talking polar bears, Lyra begins her quest to save her world and the entire universe before it's too late.    I must admit that for me the controversy surrounding \\"The Golden Compass\\" did get my attention, and it did keep me from wanting to see the movie in theaters at least; however, I didstill want to see it, if for no other reason than to see for myself if the controversy held any merit. If you are not aware of what the controversy surrounding this movie entailed, then I will enlighten you. Apparently when author Philip Pullman wrote his series of novels that comprise the \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy, he had one agenda in mind which was to attack Christianity, and make our benevolent and loving God into a being of corruption and oppression. Because of this agenda, which from what I've heard is significantly more prominent in the novels than in the movie adaptation, many religious groups opposed the film's release. In a rare turn of events the uproar surrounding a Hollywood film actually resulted in significantly diminished box office returns here in the states from what had been expected; however, overseas the box office was much more successful but the outcry was far less over there. Regarding the controversy, upon viewing the movie I can see in a few places where the story could be construed as being anti-Christian or anti-religion, but the story for the most part must have been so diluted from what was in the original novels, that I can't really see why the film caused as massive of an uproar. My guess is that most of the opposition was aimed at the books rather than the film, because what was contained in the film would have come off as nothing but typical fantasy movie content had no one pointed out the intent to be anti-Christian. Because if you really think about it, most fantasy movies feature elements that could be construed as anti-Christian or anti-religion, a prime example occurs in \\"Star Wars - Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith\\" when Obi-Wan is fighting Anakin. In the scene, Obi-Wan says something along the lines of `Only a Sith speaks in absolutes', well as a Christian I speak in absolutes when I say that Jesus is the only way, so by that statement I could take what Obi-Wan was saying as a slap in the face to my religion, but I don't because I know it is a fantasy film and therefore I view it as nothing more than a work of fiction with no real bearing on the real world or my faith.    That's enough talk about the controversy surrounding the film, now it's time to focus on what I actually thought about the movie in general. I've got to say that as a fantasy film, \\"The Golden Compass\\" is not among the best entries into the genre, especially when compared to the far more superior films that have come before it in the forms of the `Lord of the Rings' trilogy and \\"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\". The pace in this film is incredibly slow, for the most part I was bored watching this movie, and was almost tempted to quit watching several times throughout the two hour running time. Working in the film's favor were the very entertaining fight scenes featuring the polar bears, which coincidentally would turn up around the time I would lose so much interest in the film that I was preparing to turn it off, but I wouldn't thanks to those scenes. Those fight scenes were incredible from the impressive CGI effects employed to create the armored polar bears, to the hard-hitting action contained within the scene, everything about those scenes were terrific. As entertaining as those fight scenes were, the brutality of the scenes actually pushed the movie into a much darker tone than I expected. Even without the fight scenes the movie's tone felt a bit darker than most fantasy movies, but when you add those scenes to the mix the tone really takes a turn for the dark, and most likely caused many parents to not give the movie much repeat business, if they gave it any business at all after word of mouth got out regarding the darker subject matter of the movie.    The actors in this movie were all very talented A-listers, but some of them seemed a bit wasted in their roles. Nicole Kidman seemed to be genuinely enjoying her scene chewing villainous turn as Mrs. Coulter, a role that was quite a bit different from anything we've seen from her previously in her career. Daniel Craig was good as Lord Asriel, but his role felt more like a cameo than an actual lead role in the film, which surprised me due to the marketing for the film making him seem like a major player in this movie. Most likely his character would see more screen time in the sequels that may or may not occur due to the lacking box office here in the states. Dakota Blue Richards was good as the young heroine, Lyra, although I sometimes felt she was a bit on the annoying side, but for a newcomer she did a good job handling such a large role that required a lot of imagination especially in the scenes where she is supposed to be interacting with her soul (as personified by various animals) or with talking bears. The voice-over actors that personified the various animals featured throughout the film were very good, and were actually the biggest highlights among the cast. From talented veterans Sir Ian McKellan (`Lord of the Rings' trilogy), Ian McShane (\\"We Are Marshall\\"), and Kathy Bates (\\"American Outlaws\\") to newcomer Freddie Highmore (\\"The Spiderwick Chronicles\\"), the animals were given some of the best voices in Hollywood with which to speak and the movie definitely benefited from their presence.    Overall, \\"The Golden Compass\\" was an extremely dull and boring entry into the generally entertaining fantasy genre. Boasting an incredible cast of actors and actresses, impressive visual effects, and very entertaining and hard-hitting fight scenes, \\"The Golden Compass\\" could have been among the best that fantasy had to offer; instead, the movie's poorly paced story drained it of any interest for me and left me wishing it would end sooner rather than later.    \\"The Golden Compass\\" is rated PG-13 for violence.

B0002A2WDQ|4.0|Imagine my disappointment when I kicked back with my Reese's peanut butter cups all ready for a good ol' Britney Spears movie and ended up with a movie about Blues people!  That was a joke, and probably not my best either.<br />Crossroads is a great film that takes that old legend of Robert Johnson's deal with the devil and uses it as the basis for an on-the-road Blues saga.  Ralph Macchio may study classical guitar at school, but the Blues is where his heart is.  He locates the only living person who had worked with Robert Johnson and claims to know the one song Johnson never recorded.  His name is Willy Brown and he's in the slammer for murder.  Macchio strikes up a deal with Brown:  He'll help Brown escape and return to Mississippi and Brown will teach Macchio the unrecorded Johnson song, thus paving the way for Macchio's entry to the Blues scene.  You see, Brown also made a deal with the devil at the crossroads, but he feels he got hosed on that deal and wants to terminate his contract.  Most of the film is the little adventures \\"Lightning Boy\\"(Macchio's Bluesman name) and Brown get into while on the road to Mississippi.  At one point they pick up Jami Gertz and she becomes a love interest for Macchio.  Macchio, who has lived in New York and comes from a wealthy family, finally gets to live the Blues life and finds it's a poor man's life and very different from simply reading books on the Blues.  The last act of the film delves into supernatural territory when Brown finally meets the devil once again at the crossroads.  The price of a terminated contract is a guitar duel between \\"Lightning Boy\\" and another guitarist under the devil's contract, Jack Butler, who's played by none other than Steve Vai!  This is quite a cool scene, but a little comical seeing Vai in his leather pants doing all this metal shredding while Macchio tries to keep up playing Blues.  It ends up becoming a duel of neo-classical metal(thank God for Macchio's classical guitar training)!<br />The film was directed by macho action film director, Walter Hill, and he does a great job creating some southern atmosphere.  Jami Gertz is okay, but nothing special.  Macchio is miscast if you ask me.  Even though he's given this opportunity to live what he's dreamed, he spends the whole movie whining and complaining.

B00104QSOM|3.0|That the \\"critics\\" will eat up.  Only the performances of Daniel Day-Lewis as Daniel Plainview and Paul Dano as Eli Sunday save \\"There Will Be Blood\\" from being a terrible film.  Director Paul Thomas Anderson empties out a bag of tricks in order to make this movie appeal to award-giving crowd, thus eliminating the interests of most movie-goers.  Lewis is a greedy, driven oilman intent on getting the most profit from his victims by using his own down-to-earth sales pitch and cute son.  Dano plays a preacher intent on doing the same thing, but through conning the crowd as a fire and brimstone preacher.  The two lock horns when Plainview buys Sunday's family farm from his father at a bargain and then blowing off Eli and his requests for money for the church.<br /><br />The film runs about an hour too long and is littered throughout with long shot sequences, erratic music and, in actuality, very little blood.  Many have accused Anderson of either stealing from Stanley Kubrick or paying homage to him through this film.  Either way, he's no Stanley Kubrick.<br /><br />Lewis and Dano play their respective characters very well.  Plainview is a complete jerk, even to his son.  There is a very matter-of-factness in Lewis' delivery of lines that makes the character worth struggling through the plodding script to see.  Dano's Sunday is just as vicious, but in a much more sinister and silent way.  Only when he's preaching does he really raise his voice.  He also has a violent streak, as the viewer will witness during an interaction with his father.<br /><br />Overall, this film is average.  There is nothing entirely terrible about it but there's nothing entirely great either.  Dano and Lewis do great jobs with what they're given, but it's not enough to give \\"There Will Be Blood\\" more than three stars.  Recommended as a rental, unless you believe that every film that's ever won some type of award truly deserved it.
B000002GQL|5.0|Mathyushkin got married. Yes he did. He is a close relative of your beloved Metamorpho. Young, vital and red headed, he was handsome and stole the show from your Metamorpho (if you can believe that!). I thought it best not to explain the pitfalls and pratfalls of marriage to a heart that goes pitter-pat. He married the lovely Christabelle, who was postively ravishing. The ceremony had all the great ingredients that your Metamorpho has been offering the public for years. The true essence of love, spirituality and blessings. It was a baronial event and I felt the spirits of pure harmony there. Beautiful and uplifting.<br /><br />Unfortunately for me,to my surprise, the evil Suzabella (Witch of the Shore) and Robehr Sedivekkian (Warlock extraordinaire) were there as well. You remember them? They were my enemies in the Seer war years ago. I should have known something was wrong when my cheerios became soggy too quick and all my crops dried up. Well, at least we buried the hatchet for this special day, (even though I was frantically looking for a way to dig it up!). Only kidding.... I think. Regardless, the day was a day for all days. Sunshine, mild weather and joyous celebration. This is the way it should be.<br /><br />Anyway, I needed some time to write a special review. I have settled on the Moody Blues excellent c.d. \\"Seventh Sojourn\\". Why? 7 is a good luck number and one of their best efforts bar none, if you ask me. What we have here, again and so sucessfully, are compositions dedicated to the elevation of mankind. Aspects and vision and realizations about your inner world and the need to rise up to a higher spirituality. This is not to say that there are not love odes here. \\"For My Lady\\" is certainly a nice sing-song, seafaring tempo, however the subject matter in most of the songs convey hope or a quagmire that we all face.<br /><br />The amazing yearning beat of \\"Lost in a Lost World\\", for example, yields a plea to mankind to forget the illusions that they believe seperate us all. In essence, we are all interconnected with a \\"family tree that's longer than a centipede\\", and that we all are, after all, just children in this vast universe. The lovely beauty and wispful regrets of \\"New Horizons\\" reveals a man who goes forward but takes with him, and appreciates the \\"special gift\\" he has been given. But, even here, we see the search continues for everyone to find that \\"peace of mind someday\\".  Wonderful.<br /><br />You will find, with the Moodies, that alot of tunes are either clear to you or you must work to find the truth in them for yourselves. There is much pomp and undulation with \\"Isn't Life Strange\\". However, again, the motif here is the love, personal and outward, that we all need to strive for. With the jutting rythmn of \\"You and Me\\" is the message of universal harmony. The ability to achieve this, after all, resides in you and me.<br /><br />Questions.... questions.... questions. But, what is the answer? In \\"I'm Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band)\\", they admit they do not have the answer to your personal journey. The slow building drumming leads to a running beat that shows you that, to evolve, you need to find the answers within. After all, isn't this the essential project for everyone on this earth? The Moodies give you the elements. It's how you shape them to your own reality that matters here.<br /><br />The rare eloquence portayed in many of these songs, I feel, make it one of their best efforts. It has beautiful thoughts and positive vibrations throughout. Yes, even with all that darkness out there. They make the hard task of survival an obtainable goal. Listen and you will see. An extraordinary effort of grace and polish that belongs in everyone's pop-rock archive. This has always been a special one for your beloved Metamorpho. I hope it is for you too. Lucky 7. I pray that Mathyushkin will eventually \\"see\\" and be the Seer that I've taught him to be.<br /><br />This review is dedicated to my son, Mathyushkin. May the angels always be by your side to accompany you through your life.<br /><br />Love, your Dad, Metamorpho ;)you through your life.     Love, your Dad, Metamorpho ;)
B000PC0S5K|4.0|This book has served as a succinct reminder and synthesis of what I have gleaned over the years from psychology, philosophy, studies of world religions, observation, and the intensity of just living. So what if, as some other reviewers have complained, some of the material repeats what's been said before? Not everyone reads the same books, and if this one reaches those who have not been exposed to such ideas before, it serves us all well.<br /><br />I was especially struck by the idea that flowering was a transformational leap for the plant kingdom and that humankind, too, is reaching the point of its own metaphorical flowering: in consciousness.<br /><br />Although Tolle uses different metaphors (like the concept of the pain-body), he describes conditions that will be familiar to psychotherapists and clergy alike that have plagued and possessed the human spirit for millennia. There are some good old fashioned cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques in here, too (although they are not called that), and these will be helpful to many people who are suffering.<br /><br />Without getting into a heady analysis of the book, let me say that I think it's important to read it quickly and without distress if some of the discussion seems either too simplistic or too dense. I have the Kindle edition, so I just highlight those passages that strike me in some way (or makes me glaze over) and spiral back into them later. I see the work of deflating the ego/false self to be much like a walking/living form of meditation: When the thoughts of the false self arise, notice them without attachment, then gently return to the pulse (the mantra, if you will) of the present moment.<br /><br />Within this book, Tolle simply and beautifully re-presents the teachings of Jesus, Buddha, and other enlightened souls who understood what Tolle refers to as \\"the human Being.\\" I hope those my-way-or-the-highway \\"God-fearing\\" reviewers who are raging about this book being of the devil have at least read it once, cover to cover, before dismissing it so. If they are so unconscious that they really cannot read the book, at least let them sit quietly with the actual teachings of Jesus--not the hateful, closed-minded, and intolerant spewings of some imposter-pastor who claims he loves Jesus and speaks for God--until they come to that place of peaceful presence where their little lights truly can shine.d it once, cover to cover, before dismissing it so.

014028009X|5.0|This was a GREAT book. It was maybe the most fun book I have read. If you want a good laugh, then read this book. I actually laughed out loud and thought I was going to wake the house up! It was so much better than I thought it would be. I can't say enough about it!
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|The handheld camera.. or at leased they make it feel like one(theres good picture quality, but it still feels like a homemovie).. in my opinion it puts the viewer right there with the characters in the movie. there are very few examples for this subgenre, if thats what you want to call it. Blair Witch Project and Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon come to mind.<br /><br />this style of filming has been one of the best ideas in horror, because there are no other styles that make the terror and action feel so real. there were multiple times i got chills down my neck from this movie. its just.. intense.<br /><br />but.. without the camerawork, it is little more than another monster movie, which isnt a bad thing. it would still be leagues above most in the genre.<br /><br />it takes a little time to get to know the characters in the opening scenes. i found most of the characters very believable and engaging. i actually cared about their everyday lives, and past together.(the first time in a while a was fearing for characters lives. i usually like the \\"villains\\") it turns out one of our main characters is leaving to live in china or something for a while, and theres a surprise going away party for him. nows about the time to buckle your seatbelt..<br /><br />simply put, this movie blew me away. the camera style locks you in for the ride, and wont let go till its over. my heart was racing throughout 90% of the movie. you really are right there with them, dealing with the situation in front of you.. it could be the wildest ride you ever have on the couch.
B0014KD46W|5.0|While I've always had an appreciation for all aspects of Steve Winwood's music (solo and non), I've never really gone nuts for any of it.  Until now...<br /><br />Nine Lives is simply a fantastic album.  The instrumentation is sparse, made up of mostly Winwood on Hammond and guitar, a drummer, and a percussionist.  Occasionally, he's joined by a sax or flute player, and on one track Eric Clapton jumps in for a smokin' guitar solo.  The vocals consist of Steve, solo, without a doubled lead vocal track or any background vocals.  It's a fairly minimalist arrangement, but the sparseness just makes it that much more effective.<br /><br />The groove is mostly laid back, and the songs are extended into mostly five to seven minute explorations of a musical idea.  The album isn't flashy, and Winwood doesn't seem to be trying to impress anyone with his skills.  He's just out to have a good time, and make some music that he enjoys.  It translates to a remarkable album.<br /><br />Nine Lives is an unexpected joy.  I can't seem to listen to it enough, and I know I can't recommend it highly enough.  It takes a lot for an album to really blow me away.  Nine Lives blows me away...

B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Hard Candy by Madonna is a cool blend of pop, dance, and hip-hop beats. So many reviewers seem to hate this album, and I was afraid I would be disappointed too but gladly I am not. Madge sounds absolutely fantastic on this disk, her voice is highly under-rated. There are only 2 tracks that haven't grabbed me yet, She's Not Me and Dance 2night, but I am sure they will warm up to me later. In some ways Hard Candy is a better and more listenable album that Confessions on a Dancefloor, that much-loved album never quite caught on but I've grown to adore it now. Hard Candy does have a lot of hip-hop producers, Timabland and Pharrell Williams but the sound is also heavy in pop so don't expect a hardcore r & b record. The best track by far is the second single, Give It 2 Me, the hook is addictive. Heartbeat, Candy Shop, 4 Minutes, Beat Goes On, and Incredible have catchy chorus, these tracks have been in my head for days. Madge also shows her vulnerable side on Miles Away, Devil Wouldn't Recognize You, and Voices. I highly recommend this gem of 2008! Forever a Madonna fan.
B000UJ48WC|4.0|Jack,Is Jack,Is Jack. And if you like or respect him and his acting see this one in Bluray.For the first time as a regular movie or with the enhancements this movie holds you to it's conclusion.It amazes me that I still can't believe how seamlessly  the character changes and how we go along with him.My only complaint is that I did not realize how much of a woses whose Shely DuVal is. Her character was so anoyingly weak that it was hard to believe she had ANY spine to hold her upright.But this is a small annoyance. Probably Jack's best role alongside \\"One Flew Over The Cooko's Nest\\">
B000025JJ4|5.0|This is my favorite of the post-reunion Deep Purple - and it's hard to compare to the 70's days, as it definitely has a more updated, 80's metal sound (although this came out in the 90's - but \\"90s\\" metal implies to me power, death/black, grunge, nu-metal, etc. - this is still rock-based, guitar-riffing, metal like Judas Priest, Scorpions, Iron Maiden, etc.) The songs are great, the musicianship is great - you've still got (for the last time) the classic \\"Machine Head\\" lineup of Gillan, Glover, Blackmore, Lord, & Paice.  If you like classic metal, get it!
B0013D8LOU|1.0|The audio control was poor, dialogs between actors were verbally soft followed by sudden raise of music with orchestra background.  You then gotta lower the TV volume as it was too loud.  When it is back to the 'talking' part I gotta increase the volume back (it was too soft).  Did anyone experience this? or it was my player?<br /><br />Also the whole movie was relatively too dark.  The extras were better lighted.
B00006F2WY|5.0|Deep Purple's early albums are full of rock band arrangements of classical music, and this album is the pinnacle of that experimentation.  Jon Lord had had ambitions to create a \\"concerto for group and orchestra\\"  (a concerto, for those not familiar with classical forms, is when an instrument or group of instruments is set off against an orchestra - so the orchestra and the soloist trade off being the focus).  When the record company/orchestra/whoever gave them the chance to do this around 1969, they took it - although not whole-heartedly:  Richie Blackmore (although a proponent of the classical influences in general) was more interested in forging the groundbreaking heavy metal sound that would emerge on the following album \\"In Rock\\", while some of the members of the orchestra were not keen on playing with pop musicians!  Nonetheless, the project went through and here's the result.  The fusion is not seamless - in the first movement particularly it seems the orchestra is playing classical music, while (in large part due to Blackmore's self-indulgently extended blues-based guitar solo)the rock band seems to be playing straight rock music, but in later portions of the piece the two compliment each other better - with the orchestra and band trading themes or playing together.  The orchestral and rock passages are both good music - it's notable that Jon's classical influences here are rather more modern than the 18th and 19th century ones on early Purple classical fusion.  All in all, it's an interesting, enjoyable, and definitely ground-breaking work.  Jon would continue such experiments as solo albums (most notably in the excellent \\"Sarabande\\" album), and a number of progressive rock bands (Yes, Renaissance, et.c) would work with orchestras or classical soloists in the 70s, while most other classical-metal fusions would be less artistically ambitious (following A.the light \\"orchestra plays the melody while a rock band plays the backing\\" of the 80's \\"Orchestral musicof. .. \\" or B. the Metallica-lead \\"lets tack some orchestral accompaniment on some previously-written metal songs\\" movement of around 2000), until around the early 2000's groups like Iced Earth, Nightwish, Blind Guardian, and Rhapsody would lead a movement of orchestrated (sometimes real, sometimes synthesized) heavy metal.
0440219078|5.0|The Giver -   1. Publisher: Houghton Mifflin Co. (1993)  2. Author: Lois Lowry  3. Reading Level: Young Adults (Ages 11-15)  4. Number of Pages: 192  5. Genre: Science Fiction / Fantasy    Lois Lowry's The Giver is written from the point of view of Jonas, an 11-year-old boy who lives in a perfect yet artificial community. There is no pain, no poverty, no fear, no war and no hatred. This society has also eliminated choice.    Jonas has an unusual power of perception. Sometimes he perceives flashes of color, whereas for everyone else, there is no color. He also has instances where he sees objects change shapes. This foreshadows Jonas's assignment at the Ceremony of Twelve. Jonas' life changes the day he turns twelve. He is apprehensive about the upcoming Ceremony of Twelve, when he will be given his assignment as an adult member of society. The Committee of Elders tells Jonas that he has been chosen to be the Receiver. The Receiver is the sole keeper of the community's memory. Someone must keep the memories of pain, war, emotion, etc. so that the community can avoid mistakes that were made in the past. Jonas receives these memories from the current receiver, a wise old man who tells Jonas to call him Giver.    Soon Jonas learns The Giver will transmit all of the past memories of the world to him, and his life will be difficult and lonely. He was no longer able to participate in family and community activities, and was no longer able to spend time with his friends. Jonas soon realizes that the world he knew is a lie. He asks permission to view a releasing ceremony and witnesses his father murder a baby boy by injecting him with a drug. His father \\"discards\\" the young boy into a garbage, because the boy constantly cried, unlike the \\"normal\\" newborns. After Jonas receives good and bad memories, he is deeply troubled and changed. He is not forbidden to share any of his training experiences with the community.    Understanding for the first time that life is far better being aware of the memories of the past and being able to choose, the Giver helps Jonas develop an escape plan from the community. Jonas escapes and the book ends. Lowry wants the reader to create the ending to this thought-provoking chapter book.    There are some negative aspects of this book. The people in the community are not allowed to feel. They only have one point of view - what they are taught by the elders. Also, the releasing ceremony is criminal and disturbing.    In this book, young readers are asked to think about life without the ability to choose, where everyone is the same, where there is no religion. It is a provocative book that allows its readers to bring their own beliefs to find the symbolism. I recommend this well-written book be read in a school setting. After reading this book, readers can see what life could be like without diversity, and it makes readers appreciate the freedom we have to make our own choices.
B000SQJ2JG|4.0|When Deep Purple replace their singer and vocalist for the second time with David Coverdale and Glen Hughes, they started to get a funkier direction than the driving, heavy, classical-infused Gillan/Glover days.  And, for me, it was patchy - there's some great stuff on \\"Burn\\" and \\"Stormbringer\\", but also a lot of stuff that doesn't completely work for me.  When Blackmore left and they replaced him with Tommy Bolin for this album, it all seemed to fall into place again.  This album is consistently good funk (and soul) infused hard rock, and it works!  It definitely has more of a dated/of-its-time sound than the classic sound of the early 70's Purple, but that kind of adds to it's charm.  Definitely one of my favorite post-Machine Head albums by the band.  I'm not a big fan of straight-ahead funk and soul, but this has a enough hard rock kick to make it work for me.  If you like the late-70's work of Uriah Heep or early Whitesnake, this should go over well.

0312955006|5.0|Running through the back of this story is the concept that justice really is NOT blind, but that she can be purchased with enough money...<br /><br />Harry was involved prior to us getting to know him in a case that the press called the Dollmaker.  A man was murdering women - usually prostitutes and/or women involved in the pornography business - and then using their own make-up to garishly make up their faces, finally dumping them where they could be readily found.  He would follow this up by sending taunting letters to the police department and, once Harry was on the case, to Harry directly.  One night, after everyone else in the task force's night shift had left and before the day shift arrived, Harry (the leader on the night group) was finishing his paperwork when he received a call from a prostitute saying that she had just escaped from the Dollmaker and if Harry would come to her, she could show him the place.  Thinking it was another dead end, he didn't call anyone in and, since there weren't enough to go around anyway and he was going home after this, he didn't carry along a \\"rover,\\" or mobile radio.  However, once he talked more with the prostitute, he began to believe her, and - when he got to the place she instructed - he decided it was quite likely the right place.  He instructed her to wait in the car 10 minutes and if he didn't come out to go and call the police.  However, when he kicked the door down the man inside - naked and completely hairless from head to toe - refused to stand still and went for something under the pillow on the bed.  After two warnings, Harry shot.  He killed the man.  Evidence found in the apartment linked him definitely to 9 of the 11 deaths; they had found their man.  The only problem?  Harry had just shot a man for trying to pick up his toupee ...<br /><br />Several years later (three or four - I can't remember off the top of my head - I think it was close to 4), the Dollmaker's wife is suing Harry.  She claims he killed the wrong man.  Harry, being confident that he did not kill the wrong man, refused an out-of-court settlement and took the case to trial.  However, once the opening arguments were finished ... a new note arrived. With directions to another body.  This body bore all the trademarks of the Dollmaker.  However, once they discovered her identity, they also discovered she had only gone missing 2 years ago.  There was no way she was killed by the man that Harry shot and killed.  The note and the way this girl was killed seem to indicate she was killed by the Dollmaker - but if that is true, then Harry did kill the wrong man - but he doesn't believe that.  Although he is discouraged from investigating this, due to his court obligations, Harry - never one to follow the guidelines - spends what time he has free trying to discover what is going on.<br /><br />A great novel full of twists and turns.  We see Harry deconstructed on the stand and learn more about him and his past than we've seen in previous books.

0440237688|4.0|The Giver  Lowery, Lois  Published by Laurel Leaf (2002)  Reading Level: 6.5  192 Pages  Youth Science Fiction     In this captivating story, a young boy named Jonas struggles to come to terms with his own specialness, his community's secrets, and the full range of human experience.  Jonas lives in a community where everything is carefully planned and carefully controlled.  There is no suffering or discomfort, but likewise no joy and little individuality.  Children are assigned to families, mates are chosen by a committee of elders, and the weather is always comfortable. The people's lives proceed in a course prescribed by the community's elders, marked by routine, ritual and procedure.  With the passage of one such ritual, The Ceremony of Twelve, the youth of the community are assigned to a profession.  As his friends begin preparing for their new adult roles in the community, Jonas embarks on an altogether different journey.    Jonas has always known himself to be a bit different from his peers, and at his Ceremony of Twelve, he is chosen as the Receiver of Memories. As such, he is charged with holding all of the human memories passed from previous generations, so that the others in the community might be shielded from them.  And so- bit by bit- Jonas begins to receive these memories from the pervious Receiver, an old man now know as the Giver.  With these memories comes a whole range of emotions, good and bad, and wisdom well beyond his years.  Armed with these insights, and the access granted to him as the Receiver, Jonas begins to see his community in a whole new way.     This book is a wonderful read for young people or adults. It dramatically addresses the issues with which adolescents are already familiar: feeling deeply, leaving childhood behind, and questioning the rules of their upbringing.  It challenges the mind to consider issues of conformity and rebellion, and the infinite pros and cons of the human condition.  The reader must wrestle with the questions like \\"is the absence of unpleasantness really happiness?\\", \\"is getting rid of sadness and pain worth it if it means giving up things like love and creativity?\\", and \\"how far will people go to preserve harmony and avoid unpleasantness?\\".    These questions challenge and extend young minds, but may be a bit complex for young readers.  Additionally, the mood and subject matter of the book are quite dark at times, and may be upsetting to some.  Overall, however, this is an intellectually and emotionally engaging book that I found hard to put down!
0446613444|4.0|Having grown up in the upper Midwest (eastern Montana), I know all about black ice.  It is deceptive - the road looks perfectly fine, but if you aren't very careful, and if you hit a patch just right (or wrong, I suppose, would be more correct), it can send you careening off in an unexpected direction.  This idea is used to good effect in this very excellent novel by Michael Connelly.<br /><br />Harry Bosch only knew about the killing because one of the transmissions happened to go out on the regular frequency.  He was angry, because he was supposed to be on call that night for any murders, so he decided to go and crash the party, so to speak.  When he arrived, it was to discover that one of the vice cops - Calexio Moore - had apparently taken a shotgun, propped himself against the bathtub, held it to his face and pulled both the triggers with his toe.  There wasn't much left of his face.  When the body is finally moved and searched, a note is found in his back pocket which reads \\"I found out who I was.\\"<br /><br />Harry is told in no uncertain terms that his help is not wanted on this case but because Harry is completely incapable of letting things go, he begins to investigate the matter anyway.  What he discovers eventually leads him to the barrio Cal grew up in, in Calexico - right across the border from Mexicali. From bull fights to a castle on a hill, Harry's time spent in this area is vivid and beautifully described.<br /><br />This is an amazing book.  Fans of noir, thrillers, good mysteries and/or this series will love this Bosch story!
B00011D1OA|5.0|Sadly, I had never seen this movie before purchasing it here.  And this comes from a girl who adores Audrey Hepburn!  But the moment the score began I was hooked at this humerous, enchanting tale of an very unusual Cinderella and Fairy Godmother.  The music is perfect, suited to every emotion felt by every character, making for a bright, fun, and touching musical experience.  The setting is grand, even for the streets of London (though it is probably not a good thing to romanticize poverty) but in the guise of the theatre it works perfectly. The direction is different, slightly wild, and dare-I-say incredibly imaginative.  The very motions of the actors are brilliantly thought-out. The acting is spot on, especially by the great Audrey who rids herself of charm to play the most obnoxious street urchin you will ever meet.  Even as she rises through the process of becoming a proper lady she never quite loses that earthy charm.  It's a touching story full of vivid, wild characters and plenty of heart.  As for the second disk, the geek in me loved the features that added plenty of trivia to my first \\"My Fair Lady\\" experience.
B000VDDWDS|5.0|1. This is a great movie.  2. The reviewers say the blu-ray transfer for the video is near reference quality.  3. The reviewers say the Blu-ray dts-hd ma IS perfect.    I am getting asap!!
B000BYA5GO|5.0|This is what happens when you create a fight, but won't accept responsibility for your actions. Nicolas Cage plays a gunrunner who will sell any weapon to anyone-all under the table so that the major arms selling countries like the US have plausible denial when wars begin. This movie works on many levels, as a tale of misbegotten fortune, a political thriller, and action, action, action. Some humor too. Well rounded, reality-based and attracive, this is a super buy.
0061547832|3.0|Firstly, I have a confession to make. I am not a billionaire!!     Now that makes this review kind of merky because who is to question a billionaire right? I must admit when I was 2/3 finish with this book I was already to give it 4 stars. I guess you're thinking so what changed? Well after doing away with the adage that because Mr. Trump is a billionaire that this book, \\"must be\\", the gospel and I \\"must\\" follow. I realized that I have an opinion of my own. I think the begginning of the book, the quiz, absolutely sucks and is definetly not for every one. ALthough, I \\"passed\\", the quiz I felt like it was a bogus one with assumptions that everyone has a spouse and other rediculous Q & A. What was funny is once your finish with the quiz you see the answers then Donald says,\\" If you didn't pass the quiz read the book and you should be certain to pass,lol. Aside from that alot of the book is regurgitaded repeating many of the same points over and over. I think the chapter on momentum and keep your eye on the ball are really the same. However, the authors decided to break them up to stretch the book out. Also, the book is not like other reads in that Donald trys to give real world approach to business. His style of business is not my style. People who work 18 hour days and no time for other things have convinced themselves that what they do makes them happy. I hate to break it to you but business is business and know matter how much you may love your work it is a job(besides who says, when I grow up I wanna be a real estate developer). I think I will take Tim Feriss advice over Donald and Bill on this one. Another thing I had a problem with is the, \\"buy the best of things in life\\" even if you don't have it!! Assuming you will recoup it from your business clients after they see how, \\"rich\\" you look. There got to be a better way. I'd hate to see somebody lose everything taking such a gamble. I would rather take the, \\"millionaire next door\\" approach to business here.     Aside from all my complaints about this book there is nothing wrong with reading it. The inspiration of \\"thinking big\\" may just be the inspiration you need to help you be on your way. If you could use a little inspiration and a, \\"rah rah\\" moment then pick this book up from your local library and enjoy it. In fairness to Bill Zanker I liked his anecdotes they worked for him and they was nice to read and also Donald had some interesting things that are great reminders of being a business titan. For instance, when he says there's no win win in business. Donald Trump frankness is refreshing and that is what I like about this book. Although, I don't agree with some things, overall this book is an OK read. Why not snatch it up from your library? It won't cost you nothing to decide your self.
0694003611|5.0|Great book with nicely laid out objects that kids can spot. I've almost memorized the whole book.
B000UJ48VI|5.0|Stanley Kubrick takes the controversial novel, and brings us the tale of an older man driven mad by the lustful desires that he has for his teenage stepdaughter. James Mason is perfect as Humpbert Humpbert, who is the main subject of this character study. Shelly Winters is appropriately annoying as Lolita's pseudo-intellectual mother, and Sue Lyons is perfect in the role of Lolita. Peter Sellers has a hilarious role as Quilty, a pedophile comedian who also wants to bed Lolita -- and will go to any lengths he can to do so.    Under Stanley Kubrick's direction, this is a must see classic. It was quite controversial in it's day, and it still has the power to disturb, in my opinion. Humpbert is simply the Lester Burnham of the sixties.    Kubrick fans must seek this one out!
0399226907|3.0|This book tries to teach counting. I use it regularly with my daughter and she usually runs out of patience before we finish the book and just closes the book and moves on to another book.

0440234743|3.0|First, I'm not much of a lawyer book fan although I do like the grisham movies.  About the middle of this book I wondered if I ever would finish it but did not dislike it enough to stop reading.  It sped up after I got through the middle and it was ok.  Not sure why I have such a hard time with these books, whether it is the lack of human development or the mass amount of detail.  It had an ok story though and is a readable book.    A lawyer is getting out of rehab and is facing IRS issues so his firm sends him to the jungle to find an evangelist that just inherited millions despite the fact that she is an unknown illegitimate child of the miserly man that just died.
0452289963|5.0|Some have tried to define this as a new religion but Christians, Moslems, Jews and others have nothing to fear.  This is a book of techniques and philosophies that can be used to strengthen whatever beliefs or faith you hold.  It begins a new dialogue.
0525950079|4.0|I've enjoyed this every bit as much as I loved the first book.  Both are rather sizable tomes, but I still found myself getting almost nostalgic as I reached the last few chapters, knowing it was coming to an eventual end.  I think what I enjoyed the most, besides, of course, the wonderful characters, is the depth of knowledge Ken Follett has of the way the people lived in those times.  Sharing their everyday lives (and seeing how little politics have changed!) and living with them their struggles through the every day matters of being part of a culture was truly inspiring.  Please, Ken - another about the next hundred years????  And thank you for both \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and \\"World Without End\\" - not just a read, but a genuine experience.  Thank you.
0807126063|5.0|\\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" [[ASIN:0807126063 A Confederacy of Dunces]] is brilliantly funny!  How I wish we had more to read from this wonderful author.  I've read the book 6 times over the last 25 years, and each time I rue the fact there can't be a sequel.  This is a MUST read!!!!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This movie was really fun!! We went to the movies to see it when it was first released in the summer of 2007 and my 6 year old son didnt want to sit through it because it was too LOUD..LOL  Anyway, after much anticipation, we rented it on DVD and what a gem!!  We've already watched it more than 10 times..it's one of our favorites, right up there with \\"Over The Hedge\\" \\"The Wild\\" and the entire \\"Shrek\\" series.  This is a movie you don't want your children to miss...it teaches the simple truth; \\"anyone can cook...\\"  Pick it up!!
B0000009SI|5.0|Geez where do you start? I was already a longtime Zappa fan when this came around. Frank took another twisted turn and I took it with him. For the purists this may be a little too funny and a little too popular, but I think  that was as much FZ as the deep love of do wop, Edgar Varese and other bizarre musical forms. Yeah, I know it is very approachable and some hate it for that but there it is. You should get the heavier FZ stuff as well, but this is always fun treat sort of like desert at the end of a great meal.  The reviewer \\"childhood distorted...\\" did make me realize that all of Zappa's music is like a Zen koan, shocking the mind into awareness. FZ I am sure would find that last sentence very funny. Great album!!!!    As an aside, I came out of the hippie era--peace, love, everyone is at heart a good person, etc. The always cynical FZ turned out to be right with his line from Stink Foot, \\"you aint got no friends and all the others they hate ya\\". I think he meant it as humorous but I have come to believe he just knew something we didn't.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|I want to know the make of that camcorder!  And the battery it used.  Wow.  It just kept going and going.  This film is a bore.  Don't waste your time unless you've got time to waste.
B000009ROK|5.0|Good quality product of a singer admired a while back. Unable to procure thus far until recently via Amazon. Definitely for the romantics worldwide. Fabulous.
B000W4D94I|2.0|Having waited eagerly for this to be released on Blu-ray, I was somewhat disappointed in the quality of the transfer.  Not only is the Blu-ray not particularly crisp compared to the better transfers such as, say, Road Warrior, I established by A/B-ing the Blu-ray and previous non-HD version in my Sony PS3 that the Blu-ray is actually softer looking in some respects than the previous version.  So you might save your money and just stick with the version you probably already have.
B00127RAJY|5.0|To respond to one of the reviewers, this is a best seller because it gets results.  I'm down 7 lbs. in the first 7 days doing this workout, along with eating right.  Yes, I thought I would die during the first workout, but it's over before you know (20 minutes) it and is very effective.  My stamina is totally different in the 10 days I've been working out.  I'd recommend this to anyone, even beginners.  Just start and level 1 and use the beginner example.  And stick with it, because it works.
B000RJO578|4.0|As it came from the brains behind \\"Shaun of The Dead,\\" I just assumed that I'd have nothing to lose (admit: I haven't seen \\"Run, Fat Boy, Run\\"), but it turned out that this flick was solid in its own right.  I'd have given it three stars if I'd never seen any of the action films the characters talk about, but I am a junkie, so the fourth star comes from the parody of/homage to all of those same films.  I especially loved it because at about 1 hr 35 mins in there's a huge hate/love conflict re:  Michael Bay, who is both the heartbreak of psoriasis/golden child of action movies.  On the whole, loved.  But quietly.  And I think that's how Simon Pegg rolls: quietly, but well.
0783116934|5.0|I rented Citizen X one evening when my local video shop hadn't anything else to offer.  I was not expecting it to be very good, despite the casting of such heavyweight actors as Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland.  Sutherland is brilliant but erratic, while Rea is too often simply boring.    I was greatly surprised to find it brilliant.  Rea's hangdog face and weary demeanour are perfect for the role of the hard-pressed forensic scientist Burakov (not a detective as sometimes stated, although he functioned like one on this case).  Sutherland's feline turn as Rea's superior is one of the more subtle and fascinating pieces of acting he's done in the last few years - as Rea's character gets more and more stoical and unflappable, Sutherland's actually becomes less cynical and more hopeful as the film goes on.  Max Von Sydow is wonderful as the psychiatrist whose crucial profile of the unknown killer becomes pivotal in the investigation.  Some praise Joss Ackland as the bombastic and blinkered Party commissar who consistently refuses to accept that there is a serial killer at work, but I thought it was pretty much the same performance Ackland always does whenever he's playing a pompous and low-grade-evil functionary.      The real acting honours, in my opinion, go to Jeffrey DeMunn for his remarkable incarnation of Andrei Chikatilo.  Blinking, stooped, bespectacled, mumbling in his rumpled raincoat, he's a harmless and dowdy shadow of a man who as soon as he's rendered his prey helpless becomes a slavering, wild-eyed, terrifying beast - and yet you can't help feeling weirdly sorry for him.  Even when Chikatilo is on trial, it's almost as though he doesn't really understand why what he did was so wrong, and why people seem to hate him so much.  The final line of the movie - 'Please don't turn around' - is one of the most chilling moments I've ever seen in cinema.      This film puts most American-set serial killer movies to shame.  Understated, low on cheap suspense (no heavy breathing and stalking and handheld camera) and yet intensely dramatic, it's totally compelling.  It incidentally demonstrates that the collapse of the Soviet Union was not, as Vladimir Putin has called it, 'the largest geopolitical catastrophe of the century'.  It had to happen, if only because once you declare that your country is a place where serial killers can't possibly exist, you create the conditions for a Chikatilo to act out his obsessions without anyone having the will or the resources to stop him.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This dvd is a great addition to my jillian michaels collection.  I have her 5 disc set and I really like it.  This dvd is a little different since it is time based as opposed to a set number of reps of any particular exercise.  My friends and I do her workout during lunch and it's perfect to be done in 20 minutes, sweat like a pig and feel like we got a great workout with time to shower and get back to work.  We thought level one was good but not too hard so we moved onto level two. Well that was a real challenge and I don't think I'm ready for three yet.  I definitely believe I lost my last 10lbs using Jillian Michaels DVD's.  I'm thrilled and love it.
B00136NXMM|5.0|This is an incredible colaboration from two guitar masters. The interaction between Mark and Chet is a treat to listen to. I bought this CD when it was released, and it is still as fresh and interesting to listen to today as it was then. I very highly recommend it if you enjoy performances by excellent musicians.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|\\"Hard Candy,\\" as is widely known, is the final release from Madonna as a recording artist for Warners.  The album is a dance-club-ready collection of tunes that harken back to the singer's mid-eighties roots but possesses enough modern beats/arrangements - courtesy of Timbaland and others - to make it as contemporary of anything by artists many years Madonna's junior.<br /><br />The almost-50-year-old diva - one worthy of the moniker - shows that she can still strut her dance \\"stuff\\" and also be both sexually coy and direct.  The title cut is probably the most provocative on the disc and sets the stage for the \\"treats\\"  contained within.<br /><br />Each song melds almost seamlessly into the other, reminiscent of disco albums of the 70's.  In fact, one song (\\"Beat Goes On\\") contains that decade's signature \\"Beep-Beeps!\\"<br /><br />\\"She's Not Me\\" seems like a sly stab at those \\"stars\\" (Britney, Rhianna, et.al) that have followed in Madonna's well-traveled dance heals.<br /><br />Besides the aforementioned three songs, other strong tracks include \\"4 Minutes (To Save The World),\\" \\"Heartbeat,\\" \\"Miles Away,\\" \\"Beat Goes On,\\" \\"Dance 2Night,\\" and \\"Spanish Lesson.\\"<br /><br />On her last album, Madonna may have \\"confessed\\" so much that she decided to \\"heck with it!\\"<br /><br />Now on \\"Hard Candy,\\" she loudly shouts, \\"Let's just party!!!\\"
B000WCDI5K|4.0|For a collection of B-sides, bonus tracks, leftovers and covers this is surprisingly good. Unsurprisingly, it proceeds in pretty much the same postmodern mode The Killers established so successfully with their first two albums: an engaging fusion of contemporary pop-rock and 80s references that shouldn't work but almost always does. You can hear The Cure, Duran Duran, U2 and even Queen in these tracks. \\"Shadowplay\\" sounds like The Stone Roses doing a minor-key reworking of the theme from \\"The Banana Splits\\". Sometimes homage even crosses over into the real thing, as in the opener, \\"Tranquilize\\", where frontman Flowers does his best to sound like Lou Reed - then the real Lou Reed turns up. There are some gems here, such as \\"Leave the Bourbon On the Shelf\\" (crank it up, it's great loud) which seems to be another in the 'Jennifer' cycle, the masterfully ambiguous \\"Where The White Boys Dance\\" with its superb grinding baseline and early 80s funk guitar, the angsty \\"All the Pretty Faces\\", and the beautiful \\"Sweet Talk\\". The Killers work because they're about more than pastiche. Even when they're apparently goofing around or being completely melodramatic (which is often) the songs are beautifully crafted, lyrically interesting, informed by an intriguingly ambiguous sexuality, and grounded in real emotional experiences - often dark ones - that are recognizably our own. In the end, the emotional landscape feels as familiar as it sounds. That's why it works.
0452289963|5.0|This book changed my life. My Aunt Angie introduced it to me and I've introduced it to both my sisters and we've all gotten the same results.  It has been an eye opening experience from page 1 to page 316. Eckhart Tolle is an amazing man.  He has brought light and life back into our lives with his wisdom and words.  I am so grateful to have read this book about a new life!
0375842381|5.0|I picked up these books out of morbid fascination after seeing the movie and hearing a coworker talk about the book. I borrowed the first one from her and found my self intrigued so I bought the series and waited anxiously for the post man to deliver it. I found that I love these books! They are together a great work of fiction. They carried me to worlds I had never imagined through perils I would never have known. The characters are engraved in my heart. Each cut and bump and soul wrenching tear made me love them all the more. I wanted so badly for true love to win and triumph over evil and In the end I could barley see through my tears and with no truly happy ending in sight I love these books all the more.
B0000041DF|5.0|By far the greatest interpratation ever of Rachmaninov's 3rd. piano concerto! Overflowing with vitality and yet tender with feeling at the same time. WOW.
B00064X8GI|5.0|This is a GREAT album and the limited edition vinyl CD is way cool.  If you're a Pearl Jam fan you probably already have this CD in your collection but this is still a nice collectable.  This disc is the 14 song import version of TEN, including a live version of Alive plus Dirty Frank and Wash.  Highly recommended as both a limited edition collectable release plus it includes the three extra bonus songs of the import version!  A nice Win-Win for serious PJ fans.
B00004VVND|4.0|This movie is pure fun from beginning to end.  A sci-fi flick with a western theme.  A great film that has been copied time and again with less than stellar results.  See the original, the borderline-masterpiece that started a whole new genre. Recommended!
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|I have loved the Eagles for years, and have several CDs of theirs.  Last Christmas my wife and I splurged on a built-in 7.1 home theater system with high quality speakers and components.  I have been accumulating music DVDs since then.<br /><br />Other Amazon very positive reviews convinced me I should buy this DVD; I'm really glad I did.  I can play audio in either Dolby or DTS. I've found music DVD's sound best when played with DTS, so I always buy videos with  DTS audio tracks if they are available.<br /><br />I watched \\"The Eagles -- Hell Freezes Over\\" with DTS selected, and all I can say is WOW!.  The picture quality is great when upscaled, and the DTS is awesome. The DTS-only bonus track \\"The Seven Bridges Road\\" sounds so good that I plan to use it as demo for my audio components and speakers when I want to impress my friends; never mind that its one of my favorite Eagles cuts.<br /><br />My only complaint about this album is that it does not include the Eagles classic \\"Lyin' Eyes\\"; otherwise, its perfect.<br /><br />Don Henley, Glen Frey and the rest of the band have aged gracefully, but their musical and performing skills haven't diminished in any way.  This is a DVD to sit down to, turn up your volume, kick back, and rock out.
B00004VVNB|3.0|I have to admit that I liked the epcot-esque city in which this story is based.  Its retro sci-fi look is great and lends itself well to the story.  The special effects range from \\"good for the time\\" to just plain \\"bad\\".  The story itself drags on a little too long.  There is no reason this movie should be 120 minutes.  The premise, however, is good and has not been well duplicated since the original.  I simply wish sci-fi movies could have avoided \\"coming of age\\" during the time of psychedelic filmography.  Hard core classic sci-fi fans might be intrigued, but I fear most everyone else will be bored with this film.  I can say it's average, and that's about all.
044024238X|4.0|Two books down by Sophie Kinsella many more to go.  I have not read the Shopahoic series yet and I plan to save it for last.  I get the impression some readers are let down after reading that series and then trying to read a different story by Kinsella.  Well lucky for me I do not have to make that comparrison.  Personally I loved the book!  I think it would make a great movie.  Ok and I admit I couldnt put this one down either till it was done :-)
B0015D3Z4O|2.0|Prior to this release, American Life was her only album I simply could not get into..   NOW, if given the choice between listening to this once through or listening to American Life on repeat 10 times through, I'd have to pick the latter.    I absolutely loved \\"Confessions\\" and still listen to it regularly -- and where \\"Confessions\\" was a cohesive, well-thought-out project with  stellar production and style -- I just can't make heads or tails out of what this is or what she/they were thinking.   Seriously, some of these tracks shouldn't have even been passed around as rough demos, let alone making it onto a release.    Someone else used the term \\"midlife crisis\\" in another review here, and I think they may be onto something.  I get the feeling this was just thrown together as an afterthought to finish out her contract with WEA.   Perhaps it's a little of both...    As for all the reviews that give high praise for the fact that M tries different things with each release -- that is absolutely true and I've happily followed along because even the albums that were a stretch in a totally new direction (e.g. \\"Music\\") were cohesive, well-produced and seemed to \\"go somewhere\\".    Even \\"American Life\\" atleast felt like a good deal of thinking and decision making went into it... I simply can not say that about this release.       I'm completely looking forward to her next one, cause this one ain't cutting it.
1591841992|4.0|Dan's experience as a pilot and the association he makes to situational awareness in flight and business was a big part of the reason I purchased the kindle edition of his book. This comparison, in a service industry, is enormously insightful. The concept he discusses in this text has huge value for sales, service and leaders. The science of it may have been a bit more than I wanted. However, the exercises and examples and the basic premise of drawing to assist a group in understtnding where we are, where we want to go and how to get there is significant. We use a whiteboard a lot in meetings. We will certainly try pictures more in the future and test in our own environment the effectiveness of this concept. Good read for facilitators, leaders and salespeople.

B000PC0SPU|5.0|I read this title by Dan Pink after discovering \\"The Adventures of Johnny Bunko\\". Mr. Pink's application of Manga for this writing was excellent. After reviewing the sample for the Kindle, I was all in on this title. The book is insightful and informative. There is a new revolution in business in our culture that is gaining momentum. This book provides insight as to how to get into the curve before the revolution overruns our value in the job market. If you are concerned with our professional futures, Dan provides a thought process to adjust to for our collective futures. Dan's writing style insures that stats and data are delivered in a way that is entertaining and captivating. Don't wait. This information is needed by businesses and professionals now! Stay ahead of the curve in this revolution.
B00004RF8J|5.0|After discovering a rare and interesting plant, which he names Audrey II, florist's assistant, Seymour Krelborn (Rick Moranis), is shot from a life of poverty on Skid Row to fame and fortune. However, his success comes at a price, as Audrey II demands to be fed a diet of blood, and later human bodies, which Seymour must supply.<br /><br />\\"Little Shop of Horrors\\" is one of the earliest examples of a movie being remade as a musical and one of the best. The songs are great; the actors can actually sing; and what's more, everyone involved looks like they are having a thoroughly good time, which makes the audience also enjoy themselves. Although the film's plot and its title suggest that this is a horror film, it is actually a comedy and I can't imagine anyone, except perhaps a young child, being remotely scared by this film. Everything is played over-the-top and for laughs and it works too.<br /><br />Highlights of the film include a scene involving Steve Martin as a sadistic (singing) dentist meeting his match in the form of a masochistic patient (Bill Murray), and the grand finale song, \\"Mean Green Mother From Outer Space\\", which earned this film a Best Song Oscar Nomination. However, for me at least, the best thing about this film is that it was done using puppets for the plant instead of CG.<br /><br />Considering the fact that just about every movie made now days includes some sort of computerization, it is hard to remember a time when animatronics and puppets were the big thing. \\"Little Shop of Horrors\\" was made back in 1986, before CG, and as I was rewatching this film last night, I found myself feeling grateful that this was the case. No matter how good CG gets interactions between humans and CG creatures just don't look as realistic as interactions between actual objects (ie. puppets) and humans. The puppets in this film are great and they are directed by the best puppet director in the business, Frank Oz.<br /><br />The film also features a large number of cameos from assorted comedians including John Candy, Jim Belushi, and Christopher Guest. Oh and for the record, the original Roger Corman version of this film is nowhere near as good as this \\"remake\\" and is only really worth watching as a curiosity piece, to see the origins of this classic.
0061020710|3.0|I've heard many great things about Pratchett's work.  My introduction to his writings was with \\"Small Gods\\", a novel I thoroughly enjoyed.  So I decided to continue my readings with the start of it all.  For a first novel, it's a fairly good launch.  However, there was one thing that really grated on me throughout.  Pratchett tended to repeat information over and over and over at times.  While it may sometimes be necessary to remind a reader of certain information later in a book, I found it rather annoying to be \\"reminded\\" of certain tidbits every other chapter (or so it seemed).  I really don't think it was necessary to mention how Death personally harvests the soul of any wizard who dies more than once or twice . . . Pratchett felt it necessary to state this fact more than half a dozen times.  And yes, the whole \\"Rincewind has only one spell in his head\\" story was interesting the first time it was explained . . . but it got annoying around the 4th time it was detailed.    Don't get me wrong--it's not a bad work.  And Pratchett does appear to have evolved as a writer since this novel.  I'd definitely recommend it, though if you've read other books in the series it might be a bit of a disappointment.
0786838655|5.0|This book was really good. I'm sixteen and I loved it and I'm very picky when it comes to fantasy series. It has its slow moments every once in awhile, but not many books don't. Very interesting and original story, A LOT of suprises. It's also very funny, I laughed out loud a few times. If you like Harry Potter like I do, you'll absolutely LOVE this series.
B0013D8LOK|3.0|I had missed this film in the theater and I can say I am probably glad I did not pay theater prices for it.<br /><br />Overall it's a nice film to look at as the costumes and the setting was well done.<br /><br />The singing?  Well.  I thought Depp did a good effort.  However, Helena Bonhom Carter was weak at best.  To her credit, she does comment in the extras that if you are taking on a singing role for the first time, Mrs. Lovett is a bad choice.  This role would test a trained singer.<br /><br />I have to mention Sacha Baron Cohen as he did a great job in his role as Pirelli.<br /><br />One thing I found interesting was the talk(in the extras) this being almost operatic.  In opera they block the staging to suit the Music.  In this movie the effort seem to center on a fabulous scene and they tried to make the music fit it.<br /><br />As I mentioned.  The movie ended and I was left with a feeling of \\"OK it's over.\\"
B00004XQP4|3.0|Released in 2000, Warning is considered by some to be Green Day's best album, mainly because it sounds the least like a Green Day record. It forgoes the crunchy power chord hooks and snotty vocals and instead delivers a set of varied, thoughtful, and occasionally ambitious pop songs. There's more emphasis on lyricism and originality, with acoustic instruments wriggling their way into the mix and taking a seat next to songs about church and society. At times, it's even introspective.     To be honest, it wasn't the best of moves. Don't get me wrong; I've got nothing against ambition, and I'm certainly not gonna stand here and tell you that music shouldn't attempt to be smart or artistically compelling. The problem isn't that Green Day wanted to be mature. It's that they weren't very good at it.    Of course, they were still smarter than the average pop-punk band. Billie Joe Armstrong was an underrated lyricist, and he always knew how to create irresistible melodies. Meanwhile, Tre Cool and Mike Dirnt were one of the tightest, most forceful rhythm sections in existence. All three of them were damn good musicians, and it shows here. Indeed, the best songs on Warning stand as some of Green Day's finest moments. There's the beautiful, hypnotic surge of \\"Waiting,\\" the exuberant pop of \\"Church On Sunday,\\" and a great pair of anti-society rants (\\"Minority\\" and the title track). Nor have Green Day abandoned their roots: \\"Castaway\\" and \\"Fashion Victim\\" are high-speed crunchers in the band's classic style.     No, Warning is not a terrible record. It's just not a completely successful grab at maturity, either. The worst clunkers are sad proof of that: \\"Misery\\" is a strange mixture of polka and police drama, while \\"Blood, Sex, & Booze\\" just recycles a bunch of really lame sleaze rock clichés. \\"Macy's Day Parade\\" goes for acoustic introspection, but it comes off sounding hokey and melodramatic. Kinda boring, too. \\"Hold On\\" and \\"Deadbeat Holiday\\" are largely forgettable, and \\"Jackass\\" is just plain dull.     So, this strikes me as a pretty lukewarm record. They get points for their attempts at growth and for the good songs, but that's about it.

0440243661|5.0|It's odd. First, we have a truly incredible superhero or super antihero, who thinks detailed actions in milliseconds. Then we have a few technical glitches. Jack Reacher, this super-antihero, does everything but leap tall buildings in a single bound, but then there's always that possibility in the nest Jack Reacher novel. And with all that, it was a real page turner, so much so that I finished it on a red-eye while everyone else was fast asleep.<br /><br />So, if you can suspend a little disbelief (as opposed to a lot of disbelief in the one where Reacher swims underwater 300 yards in full battle gear off the coast of Maine in the winter), this may be the best of Child's novels. It's almost as good as the best Saunders and Sanders books. Four-and-a-half stars.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|May be a little expensive but remember when we used to buy film and process? If this is the only incremental cost to taking pictures, and I have taken thousands in the 4+ years I had the original before it went out, I figure it is best to just get another original Canon.    Bought an off-brand for my camcorder and wished I hadn't. Only lasted 1 year.
0345479092|3.0|\\"If you follow a structured routine, you will solve all your baby problems\\" is the idea of this book.   The routine explained in the book is called E.A.S.Y. (Eating, Activity, Sleeping, You). The author explains that the times of the individual elements of the routine will vary according to the baby, but every baby should have a routine if you want to have a life. Eating, Activity, Sleeping and Making Time for yourself are very well explained in the book in an easy-to-read way.   If you are breastfeeding, you may not feel any support reading this book, and I can even say that you may get discouraged reading some sections. Although I do not agree with the author's ideas on feeding, I would recommend this book if you are looking to establish sleep routines for your baby. I would not use this book as my only source of information on topics mentioned in the book.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This film, starring the brilliant James (Jimmy) Stewart, is one of the best movies made since film first started rolling. I don't know that words can really capture the magic of this film.<br /><br />A true holdiay classic, and a great movie! A must have for your collection!
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|Ok, I don't know what Madonna was thinking with this album. Pretty much every song on this record is relatively boring and all contain very stripped down clunky industrial beats with bad synthesizing sounds thrown in here and there. Where is the melody??, where are the strings??, Where are the hooks that make you WANT to listen to a song again and again??...There wasn't a single track that I liked enough to want to have a second listen to (Except maybe the lead single which I am already tired of hearing). And while I imagine there might be one or two minor hit singles (just because its Madonna), I hear nothing on this record that will stand the test of time. Madonna may like to constantly re-invent herself, but she failed miserably on this effort. Completely dissapointed!!
B00000JPYQ|5.0|Hands down pound for pound the Best Live Cd ever recorded.Every true Rock fan should own this they just should! Just seen these guys in Seattle and I have to say UFO will never be forgotten every era has been a Rock and Rock Joy with this band. Vinnie Moore does an awesome job displaying some out of this world chops.Schenker will always be the most unique and recognizable this band has ever had but noone should ever forget Chapman in my opinion Chapmans contributions to this band were huge on those 4 early 80's albums every song was killer on all those cd's. Ok now again on Vinnie you are a shredding god in your own right and alot of fun to watch a killer addition to the current UFO lineup. CATCH THESE GUYS LIVE PEOPLE YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED!!

0307394549|5.0|This collection of recipes from Martha Stewart Living is beautifully organized by texture & type and covers the gamut from the most basic of cookies to some of the most adventurous.  it is not by martha herself which I found refreshing since it doesn't pre-suppose you have a kitchen full of exotic ingredients and expensive equipment.  Even the most daring cookies here can be attempted by a modestly equipped cook.  Cookies with similar basic ingredients & textures are grouped together to illustrate how easy it can be to change up a basic recipe and trick it out for a more sophisticated taste-bud or occasion.  The old standby's are here as well.  All the recipes rely on good wholesome ingredients and very basic preparation methods but they add a flare of imagination. The cookie on the cover is a terrific example - chocolate filled chewy gingerbread!  Yum!  Inside are other similarly invetnive recipes such as Cream Cheese Shortbreads, Chocolate Malt Sandwhich cookies and more.<br /><br />The best part of this book is that EVERY cookie is photographed so that you can see exactly how they are intended to look when finished.  In addition, the instructions are free from frothy observations or self-congratulatory rhetoric that mar some her other publications.  She did not write this book and it shows.  Her editors wrote it.  And that my friends, is a GOOD THING when it comes to a book such as this which is intended to be the only cookie book you'll ever need.  I have already bought several as gifts for young mothers I know and dedicated cookie baking pals.  This is really the last cookie book I will ever need.  It will take me years to run out of recipes to try from this collection.

B000068IEU|1.0|The movie was recommended to us and was a huge disappointment. It was definitely a B rated movie. The music DID not fit with the plot or the scenes. We ended up selling it to the person who recommended it.

B000UOOT1W|4.0|Carlos Santana has very few bad albums, or even bad songs.  (Stay away from his collaboration with John McLaughlin though.)  If you're looking for a one-disk compilation and are familiar with his later songs plus his late 60's hits, the songs here will be familiar.    But... try Caravanserai, Borboletta, or some of his other unbelievable albums from \\"in between\\".  If this is all you know of Carlos Santana, you have a lot to discover!  What you hear on this disk is just an introduction.  I give this review 4 stars rather than 5 not because there are bad songs on this CD (there aren't), but because you, as a Santana listener, deserve more.
B000002LFU|5.0|Only four stars for this album? Green is absolutely amazing. I've read reviews where people say this album is more mainstream than their earlier work. I wouldn't agree with those statements. It is different from anything they had released before, but I don't agree that they sold out. For me it doesn't sound like a \\"commercial\\" record at all. It's just a natural progression for the band. Orange Crush is definitely one of the greatest songs this band ever produced. My favorite track off this album is World Leader Pretend; amazing! Someone said that Stand was the most commercial track they produced up to that point. I don't agree at all. This is an odd, quirky song that was the theme song for the short lived sit-com Get A Life, which was quite bizarre. REM was gaining popularity when this album came out, but they didn't get really big until Out of Time was released. To label this album commercial or sell out is ridicuous.
6305078491|5.0|The rat-toothed Nosferatu and the charming Transylvanian Count are the best known examples of early vampire movies, mostly because there weren't very many others at the time.<br /><br />But more often than not, \\"Vampyr\\" gets passed over when you talk about early vampire movies -- and that's a shame. Carl Th. Dreyer's masterpiece (loosely based on the works of J. Sheridan Le Fanu) is a straightforward little story wrapped in a hazy cocoon of dreamlike imagery and haunting direction. From the very beginning, this movie clings to you like a spiderweb.<br /><br />Occult student Allan Gray is staying at a hotel in the French countryside. But after being woken by a strange old man's cryptic warning, he finds that the inn is swarming with eerie supernatural happenings, including shadows that move independently. After he departs, a strange old man lets an ancient crone out of a closet.<br /><br />And when Allan arrives at a nearby chateau, he finds that the owner has been murdered, and his daughter Leone is suffering from mysterious wounds. After the girl is rescued from a strange old crone, she begins acting predatory toward her sister Gisele -- and the weird old doctor says that only a transfusion will save her. But the doctor is in league with the vampire -- and is working to destroy Leone...<br /><br />\\"Vampyr\\" has a pretty simple storyline, loosely based on a couple of J. Sheridan Le Fanu's short stories (including the classic \\"Carmilla\\"). But it's not the plot that makes this movie a classic -- it's the powerful, ghostly visuals that permeate it. And the beautiful real-life settings (the inn, chateau and church) don't hurt the atmosphere of it all.<br /><br />In many ways, \\"Vampyr\\" is like a silent movie -- the characters are quiet, text cards intersperse the scenes, and several minutes are taken up by printed text from the \\"History of Vampires\\" book. In addition to this, the visuals are so powerful that it's almost a shock when one of the characters actually speaks out loud. Even then, nobody says anything unless it's actually necessary.<br /><br />Dreyer films this movie as if it were a choreographed dream, letting the camera drift through ornate rooms and hazy hills. And he often fixed on striking images -- pale feverish faces, still windvanes, cloudy skies, scythes, and the movement of shadows on walls and the ground. And there are some spectacularly creepy moments, such as when Leone starts baring her teeth gleefully at Gisele, or Allan watching the view from inside a coffin.<br /><br />And he steeps the entire movie in dreamlike effects -- hazy countrysides, skeletons, floating girls, and shadows that can dance and move independently. These strange effects are done almost effortlessly, adding to the feeling that you're surrounded by the unreal. Dreyer even puts a note of humor in from time to time, such as the dancing shadows with their little folk band.<br /><br />Julian West (aka Nicolas de Gunzburg) does a pretty solid job as our unflappable hero, although I question how his suit remains pristine all through the movie -- and he does a glorious job in that bizarre dream sequence. Sybille Schmitz has a small part, but is wonderfully feral as she starts to turn vampiric, and Henriette G&eacute;rard is unspeakably creepy as the ancient, stone-faced vampire who wants other people to suffer as well.<br /><br />Carl Th. Dreyer's \\"Vampyr\\" is a rarity among vampire movies -- all haunting images and ghostly, subtle horror, with excellent acting and exquisite directions. It's a cinematic classic that should not be overlooked.ut loud.

0307387151|1.0|The reviews looked so promising, but I just could not get in to this book at all.  I checked out the audio version from my library, and perhaps it is better on paper, but I doubt it.  I have made it through the first hour of the book, and it is terrible and I will not continue. The story seems somewhat intersting, but it does NOT make Sense!  It goes back and forth from Celias perspective, to Bryany (may have mispelled that).    And I just cant figure out exactly what the crap is going on. The images I am able to conture in my mind of what might be going on are just so fuzzy, and dreamlike.  I just cant relate to this story.  I keep listening to it thinking why dont they just \\"SAY\\" what is happening, the way the author describes things is very poor.
B0002F6AH0|4.0|This 30th Anniversary Edition of The World at War has been reviewed extensively at this site, and I agree with the majority of reviewers that this series is one of the greatest documentaries about World War II.  However, I have to complain that translations are often wanting.  For example, in the two-part bonus to the series on Disc 10, entitled The Final Solution, there are long stretches of archival footage of German-language speeches and documentaries that contain NO TRANSLATION into English.  These sections of the series are a void to those viewers who do not speak German.  The World at War series is an English-language production, but this bonus documentary, as wonderful as it is in other respects, fails to reach most of its audience when translations are not provided.  It is frustrating to see and hear these stretches of documentary that are inaccessible to those of us who do not understand German.
0440237688|5.0|As soon as I picked up this book I was captivated by it. The people are all so ignorant ... the old saying ignorance is bliss Is best put here. Although there are some parts of the book that made me cry, don't ask me why but when I found out who got released I kind of knew it by the way he talked about her. Overall A great read and a captivating one at that.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Two main reasons to get this:    1. Content.  The images presented here are exceptional, this presents nature in all its glory.  It gives you rare images of many animals in their natural surroundings, and also shows lots of shots of truly beautiful natural landscapes.  A great show to watch with the whole family (although beware if you have really small children, some of the chase scenes involving wolves and such might be scary to a young child).    2. Quality.  You can tell this was filmed in high definition.  This showcases your tv like no other disc.  If your tv can handle full 1080P, the quality of these discs is incredible.      In Summary: You'll put this on for people to watch the awesome quality of the scenes, but they'll end up staying because of the incredible content of the documentary.  Highly Recommended!
0385520298|5.0|Zhuang, a young girl from a manufacturing town on the South China Sea, is sent to England to learn the language so she can further the interests of her family's business. She records her progress in the notebook that is this novel - words, impressions, incomprehensions, loneliness. Each chapter starts with a dictionary definition. The book begins in severely broken English - \\"Is unbelievabal, I arriving in London, `Heathlow Airport'...\\" -- with observations of the city and the people around her, and progresses to more abstract themes as the writer's English improves.<br /><br />Zhuang gives up her name because English people cannot pronounce it, calling herself Z, and boards with a Chinese family. In her second month of diaspora she meets a man in a cinema and moves in with him. Twenty years her senior, a bisexual drifter and artist, subject to depression and averse to commitment, he seems an unlikely object of her love and passion.<br /><br />As Z becomes more proficient in her new language the book offers insight into her cultural point of view.  Finding her lover selfish, Z observes that the Chinese are not encouraged to use the word \\"self\\" since it is the antithesis of collectivism and the self is the enemy of the communist party. On a holiday to Wales the profound silence saps her: \\"It doesn't matter if one speaks Chinese or English here; it doesn't matter if one is mute or deaf. Language is not important anymore. Only the simple physical existence matters in the nature.\\"<br /><br />I found the beginning of the book hard to read because the neophyte English doesn't allow enough depth of expression. As the language develops, Z's alienation is beautifully displayed though she defines herself somewhat narrowly in terms of her love for the English artist (who is never named for us). As evocative as this book is, it feels a bit limited by the author's self-imposed  \\"language barrier.\\"<br /><br />[[ASIN:0099501473 A Concise Chinese-English Dictionary for Lovers]] is, I believe, Xiaolu Guo's first novel in English, written while she was acquiring the language. She is a film-maker and has two published novels in Chinese. I wish I could read them and discover all that she has to say when allowing herself a full range of expression. I'm sure she will write more books in English, and I look forward to reading them.<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2008rst novel in English, written while she was acquiring the language.

B000J10ERO|2.0|I wanted to love this movie, I really, really did. But I can't say that I do.  First I'll examine the plot.  Okay, Superman leaves Earth for 5 years searching for Krypton...hold on...why would he be searching for Krypton in the first place?  He KNOWS it was destroyed thus this aspect of the plot makes zero sense.  Next, Lois Lane has a child that is seemingly his yet she doesn't seem to know that Superman is Clark Kent. This totally destroys Superman's character as the all american boy scout and once again leaves me scratching my head wondering why. Next, Lex has a plot to make himself rich that sounds suprizingly like what happened in the first Superman movie when Luthor caused half of California to drop into the ocean.      Now, on to the cast.  Who are these people? They cast not one role correctly in this entire movie.  I'm sure Tom Welling and the rest of the Smallville cast had contractual obligations that prevented them from starring in this movie but that doesn't excuse the poor choices made for all these iconic characters.  Where is Christopher Reeve, may he rest in peace, when you need him? Or Tom Welling for that matter.  I say go buy the original Superman movie and the Richard Donner cut of Superman 2 if you want to see some good Superman movies.  Don't waste your time on this one.  The only reason I own it is because I bought the Ultimate Superman collection which includes all the Superman movies.
0767812387|5.0|This movie is a \\"must\\".....very uplifting,entertaining and interesting.  I don't know anyone who hasn't liked it immensely.  Too bad Hollywood doesn't cut out the violence and produce more movies like this.

Truely the \\"Forgotten War\\", but David Halberstam brought it to life after fifty some years and I was in awe of the personalities. What a wonderful gift! What a sad fact that he is no longer with us to bring us more history.
B00009RAJJ|5.0|It's not easy to be in the position that Fleetwood Mac found themselves in after 1977's Rumours ended up becoming one of the biggest selling albums of all time.  Many songs became radio standards back then and are still familiar to anyone who does any sort of radio surfing these days.  Most bands have trouble following this sort of act because of the pressure to recreate the success.  The problem is that it is impossible to capture the same magic again.  A different type of magic can be bottled, but the great albums are unique.  It seems to me that Lindsey Buckingham and maybe all of the band knew this.  Instead of following Rumours up with an attempt to emulate that record, Fleetwood Mac chose to get more experimental and change up the formula.  The result is their best record.  Rumours is definitely catchier and a record that's easier to sing along with, but Tusk has a depth and sound that is unmatched and was bold in 1979.    Buckingham did a great job creating a different production sound for this album.  His own contributions really stand out as they sound unique, panicked, and fun at the same time.      Christine McVie and Stevie Nicks are hardly absent this time out either.  Both contribute great songs with Nicks giving us some beautiful, understated pieces.  McVie walks the line between pop and lite rock very well here with some moody pieces to go along with great pop songs.    Tusk is not as easily accessible as Rumours but it is more rewarding.  There's so much good stuff here and it has a variety that Rumours cannot match.  Don't get me wrong, Rumours is one of the greatest records ever made, but Tusk deserves to be mentioned in the same breath.    While Tusk was Fleetwood Mac's creative peak its follow up, Mirage, is another underrated gem.  That's the other problem when a band creates something like Rumours, all the work afterwards is often under regarded because of the amazing success of a perfect record.  Don't let that deter you, give them a try.
0670018651|1.0|Disappointing. Completely mis-named as \\"The Guide\\". Inconsistent in the treatment of each of the perfumes -- some so called reviews are 2 pages long, while others are one sentence. Star reviews do not match up with the comments made, e.g Chanel Coco Mademoiselle.    Considering Luca Turin's well publicised experience with the fragrance industry, I was expecting a series of balanced analyses of perfumes on the market -- instead the \\"reviews\\" are biased towards some brands or perfumers and rely more catchphrases and name dropping.     Sure, at times I agreed with the star rating of say, Ange ou Demon (one star), but reading the comments was like watching someone pull the wings off of flies. Mean spirited and cringeworthy.     Would have been more helpful if they'd actually gone into what was wrong/right with the fragrances....e.g \\"The lemon/herbal clashed with the sweet vanillic base note.\\" Instead of going on about cough syrup and how many coats of paint a ferrari needs.       I would not be using this to choose (or avoid) my next perfume. Opinionated schlock which is useless as a guide.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is by far the best DVD I have ever purchased!  Normally after a couple of workouts my DVD's head to the closet and I lose interest. Not so with this DVD.  I look forward to using it 5 days per week because it is only twenty minutes and I know it works!  I did the Level 1 workout for a couple of weeks.  The first day I thought I was going to die and did not think I could make it through.  I was VERY sore after.  She says each day you can feel your body getting stronger and she is right!  Each time you will be amazed at how your body is stronger.  She is a great motivator.  I was concerned that my body would get used to it but I feel it every time and it feels great.  I started level 2 last week and it is also very hard.  So far have lost 15 pounds in the first four weeks and two sizes.  I am also watching what I eat.  If you want to change your body, this is the answer.  There is no reason why anyone, any size can't do this video and have success if they keep it up.  I just hope she comes out with more DVD's like this because I love it!!  Change your body, change your life, I am!!  Thank you Jillian!

0938045695|3.0|I have been a fan of kettlebells since I first learned of them 4-5 years ago from a martial arts friend. I LOVE kettlebells as a workout. The explosive power you can generate is an absolute rush.  I wanted a book that went over the various types of kettlebell exercises since I wanted to do more with them, and this was not it.      This book is a basic intro for beginners who've never done anything with a kettlebell before.  It was interesting to know some of the history.  But as far as exercises it's very lacking. He only covers 4 or 5 basic moves. Pavel and the other Dragon Door people waste pages and pages on humorous pictures of Pavel doing the lifts wrong, which I guess a beginner would need but I thought it was just an insult and a waste of my money.  So don't waste your time unless you've never picked up a kettlebell before. It is a good place for a beginner to start.
B000NA1Z1A|5.0|Now, my parents made me buy the CLEAN version and really that's the only downside to this album: the clean. The explicit is so exciting and good it's so awesome. Anyways, Amy is an amazing artist and the songs are so catchy and good, I can't stop listening.    The only other problem with the album which is not that big of a deal is that every track is depressing. There isn't anything about getting together, it's all about breaking up and cheating and drugs. But the thing the depressingness so \\"not so big\\" is that they were all written from her heart and what she believes in.    An amazing album by an amazing singer. The beat to the songs go so great with her voice and it makes the songs sound great.
B00005JO20|5.0|King Kong is Peter Jackson's first movie since completing The Lord of the rings trilogy.  Once again Jackson proves himself as a master of filmmaking.  While not as epic, or as good, as the Lord of the Rings, King Kong certainly is a masterpiece.  Some have argued that this movie is driven by little other than it's special effects.  The special effects are astounding, and plentiful, but there's no question that this is a character-driven film.  A considerably large portion of the three-hour movie is used to establish the characters, during which time we see neither Skull Island or the great primate himself.      My favorite things about the movie: Naomi Watts, James Newton Howard's score, and the action hero Bruce Baxter (played by the guy from the TV show Early Edition).  Jack Black is PERFECT as the obsessed filmmaker.      Also I liked the ending, where Jackson portrays neither King Kong nor the pilots that shoot him down as evil.  We sympathize with King Kong yet realize the necessity of killing the beast.  The long running time can be a turn-off for repeated viewing, but if its the first time you will not be bored.
0452289963|5.0|This is fantastic read and makes so much sense but I think he is right if you are not ready the book won't make sense to you.  I disagree with some written comments about him being into Buddhism, I don't think this is about religion period, that why this is so great finally freedom of spirituality!
B000001FSR|5.0|A Tom Waits album is the aural equivalent of walking down a dark twisty path with a cantankerous old uncle who mixes Old Testament wisdom with dirty jokes. Franks Wild Years is another entry in this fine tradition.<br />As you may already know, this album is taken from an opera that Tom and Kathleen wrote. If you are interested in further explorations of this project, check out Big Time - both the album and the movie (available only on VHS).

From \\"Political World\\" through to \\"Shooting Star\\", Dylan demonstates again why he is regarded as one of the world's great song writers and tune smiths.  This albums ranks in with \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\" and \\"Modern Times\\". This is essential Dylan.
B00110K62U|5.0|Having seen Les Miserables in London years ago I fell in love with what I consider the greatest musical of all times. I saw the 10th anniversary concert on PBS and once again was overwhelmed. Now, the concert is available on DVD and I can't be strong enough in my encouragement for you to buy this concert. The talent involved is the very best. It is such an encouraging and moving story of forgiveness performed by some of the greatest who performed in the musical in past years. How they got all these people together for this one great performance at London;s Royal Albert Hall is a work of genius. You will not be disappointed. This is a real keeper and you'll play it over and over. What talent...what music...what joy!!!!

081541028X|5.0|I was reading Deke! By Donald K. (Deke) Slayton and Michael Cusset. Deke Slayton was the highly respected chief astronaut and godfather to the astronauts of the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo missions;  In this book, I noted a positive reference to Michael Collins's book Carrying The Fire so I figured this as a must read.   Michael Collins takes the reader through the stages of astronaut training and spaceship design and his own flights of Gemini 10 and the pioneering Apollo 11 with  self- depreciating humour and irony. He manages to present a great amount of technical detail in an easily understood fashion in an articulate, intelligent, flowery, almost British manner.   With a forward by Charles Lindbergh himself, this book is nearly 500 pages but seems only half that by the man who stood station 60 miles above Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on that historic first lunar landing.
B00005JLR2|4.0|This, along with \\"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\\", is surely being overshadowed by other more popular ones such as \\"Monsters Inc.\\" and \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" and \\"The Incredibles\\" and so on. \\"Treasure Planet\\" really is something worth watching.<br /><br />Some of the finest things that are in this film are the animation. I'm floored by the visuals of outer space (rendered in both 2D and 3D). The supernova/black hole sequence is a sight to see. And the scenes in which Long John Silver demonstrates his Cyborg skills by cooking some stew and tracking his enemies down should be considered classic.<br /><br />The music is also something to look forward to. James Newton Howard mixes a Celtic folk style with a typical Hollywood classical sound. I know it doesn't seem like a good combination, but Howard executes it so well.<br /><br />As for the characters, it's a mixed reaction. The non-human characters like Doppler and Morph are well-drawn, but their personalities are aimed slightly towards the little kids. Long John Silver is brilliantly created, although he's nowhere near as good as Robert Louis Stevenson's own version. Captain Amelia is an attention-grabber: she looks lovely. Jim Hawkins has certainly gained a cult following in the recent years, and it shows. He's attractive, he's anti-heroic, and he's one of the great protagonists of all things Disney. B.E.N. is sadly an irritant. I was hoping that he would be much more like the orginal Ben Gunn, but I was disappointed. His screaming and his constant reminding that he's \\"lost his mind\\" is not enjoyable.<br /><br />So with all the flaws aside, \\"Treasure Planet\\" is one of the underrated classics of the new millennium. And while it bombed in the box office, its cult following makes a point: the film will never die (and I mean that in a good way).<br /><br />B+
B00005JL3A|5.0|There's just something about watching a hot babe laying the smack down on anyone and anything that gets in her way - and no one does it better than Milla Jovovich.  She is, to put it mildly, a whole lot of woman.  Resident Evil isn't all about Milla, though; nor is it all about the gore (actually, the movie wasn't nearly as gory as I expected).  Above all, though, Resident Evil is not to be dismissed as just another video game adaptation thrown haphazardly together just to make money.  This film has substance, subplots, and surprises to go along with the generally impressive special effects and, for my money, pretty good acting.  In other words, while the unfortunate denizens of the Hive may be essentially brainless, Resident Evil is not.<br /><br />I have only limited experience playing the original video game.  I never got very far into it, mainly because I wasn't very adept in the gameplay department and didn't spend the time necessary to significantly improve my minimal skills.  All I remember is exploring the house and trying to kill the occasional zombie that popped up along the way as the music did the principal work of creating a spooky atmosphere.  The movie is much more intense than that - and far more suspenseful.  It's not like some clumsy scientist just happened to drop a beaker, thereby exposing the deadly T-virus all of his geeky colleagues.  On the contrary, this story generates a whole host of questions in the first few moments, questions such as who released the virus and why, but also why is the room housing such a deadly virus tied in to the ventilation system of the whole complex to begin with?  (I can't say I got an answer to that last one.)  I actually had to go back and watch the exposure moment a second time because I thought I had missed something the first time.<br /><br />Don't expect Milla's character to supply you with any early answers, as Alice wakes up in a ritzy-looking house with no memory of who she is.  Even the shocking jolt of a stranger claiming to be a cop grabbing her just before a team of commandoes suddenly crash through the windows fails to jog her memory, but she doesn't question the special ops commander when he tells her she is one of two security agents stationed in the house to protect that particular entrance to The Hive, the mega-powerful Umbrella corporation's top-secret, underground facility devoted to all kinds of dangerous and illegal research into bioweapons and the like - and that her amnesia is the temporary byproduct of exposure to a nerve gas.  By the time she and the suspicious cop accompany the group to the entrance to The Hive, Alice has met her equally amnesiac \\"husband\\" and learned that the Red Queen, The Hive's central AI, locked the whole facility down and killed everyone inside in an effort to try and contain the super-deadly T-virus from spreading outside the complex.  Their mission is to get to the Red Queen.  It sounds pretty simple, what with everybody down there being dead and all.  As they soon discover, however, those 500-odd dead bodies have arisen as blood-thirsty, flesh-eating zombies, and the Red Queen isn't going to let anyone into her inner chamber without putting up a fight.<br /><br />The majority of the movie, to no one's surprise, consists of the team members trying to survive the onslaught of hordes of zombies, high-tech computer defenses of last resort, etc.  As all of that exciting action is taking place, however, we see Alice trying to sort through the memories coming back to her in intermittent waves.  She is a much more central figure in all of this than even she knows early on, and she isn't the only team member with secrets to be revealed.  That leads to some surprisingly effective plot twists that not only advanced the story in important and plausible ways; they were also presented very much in the context of earlier scenes in the movie.<br /><br />It doesn't matter if you've ever played the video game or not - Resident Evil is justan exciting, action-packed horror film.  I don't consider it to be the least bit scary, but it is quite atmospheric. As a horror fan, I must say I've never counted zombies among my favorite monsters - let's face it, they're basically mindless, slow-footed creatures with no erotic potential whatsoever - so I'm not just whistling Dixie when I say that Resident Evil is a great movie.  Of course, a lot of the credit has to go to Milla Jovovich, the finest of one-woman killing machines.ror film.  I don't consider it to be the least bit scary, but it is quite atmospheric.

0446310786|2.0|This book is one of the quintessential \\"high school classics.\\" It appears classic and deep only to those who lack the art and intellect to grasp the shallowness of it. It seems like there is a lot there up until the point where you begin to understand it. Apparently, the vast majority of people never do. It is a shame really, but I suppose that is the way it is. So much time and energy poured into books which are simply bad.    Sorry to ramble like this, but it verges on heart-breaking to see so many good reviews for a book that barely approaches passable. Its imagery is poor, its premise is shallow, and the attempt to \\"enlighten the human condition\\" is a flimsy pretense to draw out the phony intellectuals who cannot see 10 inches past their own lies long to see that agreeing with the crowd doesn't make you an intellectual. The problem lies in the fact that the book is a triumph of vagueness. It has a certain undefinable characteristic that many mistake for art, but which is, in fact, a simple lack of talent. The reason it is vague is not because there is a truth behind the words, but rather that there is a *story* behind the words that the author lacks the talent to draw out. A bad story, by the way. A rambling, pointlessly morose, insipid story lacking any value either in entertainment or art. Let us not even approach any further the lack of intellectual content, or otherwise I fear I may vomit.     This book is, however, a certain kind of triumph. It is a triumph of marketing. It is a triumph in the manipulation of plebian minds yearning to appear, or perhaps be, more than they are.     I beg of you, do not deride your own intelligences by attempting to force them to heights they are not capable of. If you cannot go beyond a certain point, do not do so. If books like this continue to sell in such immense quantities, I fear for the fate of all art.
0810993139|5.0|I got this book for my 8 year old daughter.  She enjoyed it so much that she had it read in 3 days.  In her own words this book was \\"awesome, hysterical, and attention grabbing\\".

It's not a movie in my opinion when you constantly look through a camcorder. Low budget effect. Whole movie is like this. I skipped from scene to scene - all annoying. Took the movie out of the dvd player and threw it directly in the trash. Only reason I gave it one star is the review is accepted with a minimum of one. Otherwise 0.
B0007P0LO8|3.0|From the David Belasco play to Puccini's opera to Schonberg's Miss Saigon, there are many faces of Madame Butterfly. But none is any more exquisite than that of Mirella Freni-- especially as she sings the near-perfect aria, \\"Un bel di\\" and the Flower Song duet with Suzuki. However, Ponnelle, who staged and directed the film version, made Placido Domingo as Lt. Pinkerton  a little too caddish for my taste. This version seems to resemble a faded memory that speaks not to the intellect but to the heart. It certainly deserves a place in any opera collection.
B00065MDSQ|4.0|\\"Red\\" is my favorite King Crimson album. The biggest flaw in any KC album, in my opinion, is uneven quality. For every deep and captivating track(\\"Court of the Crimson King\\"), you had another that was simply boring(the last 8 minutes of \\"Moonchild\\"). I consider this to be the KC record with the greatest awesome-to-crap ratio.    \\"Red\\" smashes onto stage with a crunchy, dissonant guitar riff using the whole tone scale and some seriously fuzzy bass. This is dark and brooding stuff. The pallor never lifts from the record, so the easily depressed may want to take a rain cheque. Anyways, I believe Robert Fripp once said that the goal of KC was to make \\"intelligent metal.\\" This is it.    \\"Fallen Angel\\" continues the sulking. John Wetton sings the story of a gang member recruiting his younger brother, only to see him die. The lyrics are more coherant than, say, your average Yes album but they are still prog rock lyrics. John Wetton may annoy some people, he's not the most expressive singer. I find that rather appropriate though. This is also the last time you'll hear Fripp play an acoustic guitar on a Crimson record. Instrumentation is excellent, with some great sax and guitar work.    \\"One More Red Nightmare\\" is about a man who dreams of being in a crashing plane. It's got a great opening riff and an evil bass line. Wetton is probably at his best, singing wise, right here. More wonderful darkness.    \\"Providence,\\" on the other hand, is plain old noise. Boring, long winded noise. It's an avante-snore jam. Makes me sleepy just thinking about it. I'd be willing to forgive the album for this track but without it, the total music clocks in at 31 minutes. Barely more than an EP.    \\"Starless\\" mostly makes up for this shortcoming though. The opening section is slow and sad. Wetton intones sombre lyrics as Bruford drums quietly and a saxophone plays a lonely tune. Wetton trails off and Fripp starts to build tension. He plays two notes over and over again, while the music gradually fills in. Just when it seems that the song can't possibly go on any longer, it explodes into a soprano sax solo. It might annoy some people but I love the way the tension and frustration builds until it is released in one big torrent.    If it weren't for \\"Providence,\\" I'd give this album 5 stars without hesitation. The album is just too short to have such a long, annoying track on it though. That being said, the other tracks are so strong that you simply have to buy this album if you like prog rock or prog metal. Heck, even if you don't, try it anyways. Open your horizons.
184195392X|5.0|I'm probably really stretching things but I find it hard to believe that Martel would write a whole book and title it The Life of Pi without giving a thought to mathematics. To my mind, Pi's 227 days on the raft (227 is a prime number) represents a struggle to find meaning in religion. Pi is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to the diameter - and so it is with the life of this boy looking to the world for the meaning of life.  In the end, you believe what you want to believe (just as you do with religion) but your life experience, culture, indoctrination, even your language is what shapes your thinking.  Ultimately, mathematics can offer far more inarguable constructs to explain our universe than can religion.
B000009RC2|5.0|From the sinster crash of the opening chord until the sudden end, this album is a helluva ride. By turns strange and fierce(\\"Meeting of the Spirits\\", \\"Vital Transformation\\", \\"Awakening\\"), slow and soothing(\\"Lotus on Irish Streams\\", \\"Dawn\\", \\"You Know You Know\\"), or just plain out there(Dance of Maya), there's lots of variety and not a bad track on here.    Throughout the album, John McLaughlin simply shines. When you consider the playing field of the time, John was \\"Miles Beyond\\" most of his contemporaries. He ripped through scales at lightning speed, in time signatures that would make many guitarists go cross-eyed. He wasn't confined to high speed solos, proving himself capable in an acoustic piece(Lotus). He does tend to go a little fast, even in slow songs, which may be a turn off to some. I just think of it as having a lot to say.    The rhythm section deserves props as well, especially Billy Cobham. He's simply an amazing drummer. Rick Laird doesn't get a solo that I remember but he provides a solid foundation. Even Jan Hammer, who I generally dislike, plays excellently here. The record does have a few flaws. \\"Noonward Race\\" is a little lacking in substance. \\"Awakening\\" is an obvious attempt to end the album on a high note but loses out to classic tracks like \\"Meeting of the Spirit\\" by a hair. However, this is all easily overlooked and I highly recommend \\"The Inner Mounting Flame\\" to anyone who enjoys jazz fusion or rock that's a little out there.

0805079831|4.0|Like the bullet hole on the cover of The Shock Doctrine the latest book by Naomi Klein, the author of 2000's No Logo, capitalism is a deadly rupture to our respective societies and economies. The book details how the best tool employed by modern practitioners of corporatism are natural or unnatural disasters that momentarily divert the population's focus and concentration. With deliberate and pre-arranged strategy the architects of what the author terms 'disaster capitalism' step into everywhere from Chile to New Orleans and Sri Lanka to South Africa to degrade and humiliate local populations through a series of shock therapies, which include enriching multi-national corporations, privatization and the suspension of freedoms and human rights. It is this last point - which capitalism is incompatible with a free and informed citizenry - that is dealt with in detail and is heavily explained in a far-reaching manner. The lines connecting capitalism instilled only when the population was looking the other way and the death of both political and economic control are staggering.<br /><br />Naomi Klein retells the story of country after country in contemporary settings where right-wing policies of the infamous Chicago School translate into methodical torture (with a literal Canadian background no less), war and betrayal just as disaster and calamity visits a disoriented populace. Taking the last forty years into context and correlating Milton Friedman's economic theories, Klein manages to show a direct link between death and the dollar, coups and corporations and war and wage freezes for you and wage increase for the henchmen. The neo-liberals/conservatives/Reaganomists or fanatics of globalization advance the dangerous notions of the elimination of the public sector and freedom for corporations through \\"the full force of the US military machine.\\" Quoting an oft openly sadistic Milton Friedman, Klein exposes the Shock Doctrine as a Machiavellian philosophy disdainful of government, communities and the grassroots in open warfare with a democratic state. A market opportunity, based on this model, is predicated on a disaster.<br /><br />The book illustrates an inherent connection between repression and market economics through case studies of Chile (Pinochet's US-sponsored coup and his connections to Friedmanites), Brazil's dictatorships (disappearing thousands), Chinese 'reforms' (in the face of public protests and entailing the lifting of price controls and other impoverishing tactics), South Asia's tsunami (and the subsequent removal of indigenous villages and businesses to be replaced by tourist centres on the oceanfront), ANC's betrayal of South Africans (in response to the demands of the crashing local stock market and mining giants like DeBeers which moved its headquarters to Switzerland upon Nelson Mandela's release), the US invasion of Iraq (no-bid contracts and cost-plus darling deals) and ultimately hurricane Katrina (the closure of public schools in favour of Charter schools which quickly hired the former school system's teachers, albeit at a lower wage) and the events of 9/11 in the USA. Quoting from a Brazilian report on human rights violations called Brasil: Nunca Mais, \\"Since the economic policy was extremely unpopular among the most numerous sectors of the population, it had to be implemented by force.\\"<br /><br />Capitalism and improvements for the vast majority of peoples are incompatible. Unfortunately, as shock therapist economist Anders Åslund would say, \\"the miraculous temptations of capitalism conquer more or less anything.\\" Absent from this rant is the qualification that miracles and temptations are illusory and everything, by definition, necessitates a population.<br />Shock And Awe, which was initially articulated by a US Navy strategist as a warfare manual would go on to better describe America and the Western world's larger declaration of war on all things not under its control.<br /><br />The book is finally another widely circulated success for the Canadian author, albeit with its own flaws. Decrying the fanaticism of the market should have given the author pause to not quote from the bible. The book has shaped much of modern thought and been the ultimate enabler for the elite to rule over the population. On page 396, Klein commits a mistake better associated with the ignorant sectors of the market place by placing Iran on the list as \\"an Arab country.\\" Moreover, Klein (very much like [[ASIN:0312421435 No Logo: No Space, No Choice, No Jobs]]) cannot help herself and has given credence to business-as-usual multi-national monopolim by publishing the book through just such a firm. That type of fallacy is more troubling than single instance geographical mistakes.<br /><br />The Shock Doctrine: The Rise Of Disaster Capitalism is modern history in motion and the perfect repudiation and retort to the apostles of liberalism, conservatism, capitalism and the unfettered arrogance of the so-called market. If only right-wingers could and would read it without prejudice. Implicated in the web of disaster capitalism are many lesser-known persons in The World bank, International Monetary Fund, military dictators and industry captains, as well as public personalities like Reagan, Bush, Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld, Cheney and Kissinger. Not so odd then that every cataclysmic event would be utilized by the aforenamed as a market opportunity to be exploited with the might of US' dollar and firepower.<br /><br />The book quotes political scientist Alan Wolfe (calling him mistakenly Michael Wolfe) as written in Washington Monthly as saying: \\"Conservatives cannot govern well for the same reason that vegetarians cannot prepare a world-class boeuf bourguignon: If you believe that what you are called upon to do is wrong, you are unlikely to do it very well.\\" Conservatism in government, politics and economics is a disaster as he so accurately explains.

B000YAA68C|4.0|Marketing P.S. I LOVE YOU was a hit/miss situation.  The general trailer and the billboards seem to set the audience up for a sappy tearjerker. But happily what happens in this film is not the expected 'widowed person communicating with the dead love out of failure to get on with life' tale, but instead a look into the importance of friendship, family, and adjusting to the incomparable loss. Credit the original novel by Cecelia Ahern as adapted for the screen by Steven Rogers writer/director Richard LaGravenese for making what so easily have been a sappy, maudlin, whining tale into a  touching one of human emotions with a sense of reality mixed with a mildly implausible situation, and a  series of character studies that emphasize the importance of support in the time of grief.<br /><br />Holly (Hilary Swank) and Gerry (Gerard Butler) Kennedy are a married couple with goals and frustrations and a huge dollop of passionate love, surrounded by friends and family. The tragedy happens just as the movie starts: Gerry has died of a brain tumor leaving the copeless Holly alone with her memories and self-inflicted regrets.  But Gerry, knowing he was a terminal patient, devised his own plan to help Holly through that first year of grief: he left letters in various forms and places, advising Holly how to learn about his family and how to get on with life. Holly's mother (Kathy Bates) owns a bar and has supported her little family since Holly's father deserted his family years ago.  In the bar is another injured soul named Daniel (Harry Connick  Jr.) who fancies Holly but realizes she is far from ready to think about dating. Holly's friends Denise (Lisa Kudrow) and Sharon (Gina Gershon) accompany Holly to Gerry's pre-planned trip to his home in Ireland to meet the in-laws Holly never knew.  While in Ireland Holly reminisces  on the magic of first meeting Gerry, meets Gerry's parents as well as Gerry's best friend William (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and through it all manages to appreciate the gift of PS I Love You letters and reminders Gerry has left for her.  And she ultimately finds closure to her loss.<br /><br />The cast is strong and makes these at times strained characters into lovable people: Hilary Swank has made a successful entrance into the feminine lead role and is balanced to perfection by Butler, Morgan, Connick, Bates, Kudrow and  Gershon.

1594200440|4.0|The premise of this fun little novel is simple: An elderly Ukrainian widower in Britain falls in love with a voluptuous young Ukrainian woman and brings her over to the UK. Kanye West has told this story before -- Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, but she ain't messin' wit no broke . . . well, actually he is broke. And when she realizes the old man's pension won't provide the luxuries of the West, things get rocky. His two feuding daughters must then rescue him from her clutches, despite their mutual loathing.    I actually began the novel with some trepidation as it borders on Chick Lit, and I am a non-chick. Lewycka does include many conventions of the genre -- intra-familial drama, chatty narration, Dark Family Secrets, and feckless male characters. Nevertheless, her wit and comic timing rescue the novel, as does the genuinely interesting history she weaves into the narrative. Her treatment of Ukrainian emigre life and her characterization are also spot on. The Ukrainian characters all rang true with me -- the strong, matriarchal mother, the grasping, stilleto-heeled beauty and the cerebral, absent-minded \\"engineer\\" are types you often meet in Ukraine.    Much of Tractors coincides directly with my thesis topic, and I'm impressed with how well she drew in the history of Soviet Ukraine, World War II, and the plight of the Displaced Persons. If I have a quibble, it's in her overly dark view of modern-day Ukraine. But this is a tiny flaw in an otherwise enjoyable read.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|If you're a longtime Austen fan and you love P&P then, yes, this movie may be disappointing for you.  But if you can take this movie as it is, without comparing it to the literary work too much, you will simply fall in love.<br /><br />Everything about this movie is enchanting. Kiera Knightly does a fabulous job of playing the spirited Elizabeth Bennet, completely unaware of her own beauty for in society it does not compare to her sisters.  But the person that really makes this movie is Matthew MacFadyen, who plays Mr. Darcy.  He truly captures all of the unlikeable traits of Mr. Darcy in the beginning, and has you completely in love with him at the end.<br /><br />Tom Hollander is Mr. Collins and he captures him completely.  The dance scene between he and Lizzie alone is worth the price of the movie.<br /><br />Visually entertaining, it's like taking a peek through a magical looking glass and catching the smallest glimpse of what life must have been like in England near 1800.  Austen was truly a master of writing about the kind of love that would escape her.  Every girl should have a Mr. Darcy.
0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee's 1960 novel, To Kill A Mocking Bird, is one of the most important pieces of American literature to date. Aside from being enormously important, it is also an excellent read. Every middle-schooler should read  this book.    Lee's novel takes place in small-town Alabama during the Great Depression.    The narrator is Scout Fitch, the daughter of Atticus Fitch who is a local attorney.   Atticus is assigned to defend a local black, Tom Robinson, man who has been charged with raping a white woman.  Much of the town disagrees with Atticus' decision to defend Robinson, and vehemently taunts Scout for his father's actions.   Atticus is able to prove Robinson's innocence, but Robinson is convicted of the crime anyway. Robinson is later killed while trying to escape from prison.  The alleged victim's father, Bob Ewell, is humiliated by the trial and menaces Atticus' family.  In the end, Ewell attacks Scout and then dies in the confusion of the attack, probably killed by Fitch's mysterious neighbor, Boo Radley, who the children in the community have been fascinated by for years.     This incredible piece of literature broaches many important topics in our    society:  racial tensions and race relations(especially in the South), injustice in the legal system, class, sex crimes and the importance of courage and integrity.   The book deals extensively with these issues, but is still very light-hearted and humorous.     Above all else, To Kill A Mockingbird, is a poignant reminder to all who read it about the importance of humanity and good will towards all.  The book is one of my favorites because it reminds me of what is good and just in this world, and can be, even in our darkest hours of moral ambiguity.  It is a reminder that there are always people out there, in the face of impossible odds and situations, striving to do what is right and just.    I treasure this book and hope everyone reading this review will buy a copy and read it.  It will better your soul!
0452289963|5.0|I highly recommend this book. It will change the way you look at life. I find myself going back and rereading it. I am telling all my friends/family this is something they need to read. Also I would recommend downloading the online classes on Oprah's website to go along with this book.
B00003W8NM|4.0|What is the role of a man in modern society? What happens when a man searching for some relevance loses his way and goes down the wrong path, and I mean the really wrong path? What emotions will society allow a man to express and under what conditions? If man can't show external signs of emotional pain, what leads him to crave physical pain?  Where are the valid models of masculinity and manhood in our stereotypical consumerism society? Why do men struggle for independence while simultaneously longing to join the pack? How do men redirect or repress anger so they can function in society?  How does modern man cope with the loss of the aggressive, primitive, warrior masculine archetype that haunts our genes? All of these issues are explored in Fight Club.  Despite the violence, this satire and social commentary is highly entertaining.    Ed Norton is superb as a young man trying to make sense of his world by maintaining a 9 to 5 job, traveling for work to non-descript towns, restaurants, and hotels, buying a condo and furnishing the condo in a manner that shows he knows what is hip. He grows increasingly hostile to his supervisor and his job. Numb to this world and finding that he has no real meaning in life or outlet for his emotions or feelings of connection, he begins joining 12 step programs and disease/survivor support groups.     He joins the testicular cancer support group where men mourn the loss of their testicles and cry in each other's arms. Thus, in a prescribed time and place and condition, men may cry. They can cry over the loss of their manhood, their virility, and their fertility.  But these men are mocked in the film for they choose to cry instead of howling. They show emotional pain rather than crave physical pain as the release of their internal pain.     Our narrator meets a young odd woman who craves human connection by attending endless 12 step and support group meetings, just like the narrator. Helen Bonham-Carter plays this role extremely well.So well does she take on this character that this may be one of her strongest performances on film. Wouldn't you think that two young people who crave human contact and genuine emotion so much that they attend endless meetings would find each other? Of course they can't for they don't even know what ails them. They even arrange to attend alternating meetings so that they don't run into each other. Why? Because they may experience genuine emotion should they open themselves to each other.    Then Tyler Durden comes into the scene. He is the narrator's image of masculinity; roughly handsome, arrogant, brash, sarcastic quick wit, fights, doesn't really work because he thinks he can outwit the system, can take a beating, has wild sex, and is firmly grounded in an atheistic bleak existential personal philosophy drenched with nihilism. We have seen this character before in the novels of Paul Bowles and Cormack McCarthy. This archetype never ceases to amuse.    So many themes emerge in this fast paced film. Tyler begins to introduce our narrator to the fight club, an outlet for their aggression and inner pain. For in beating the hell out of each other men release their aggressive impulses and the genuine physical pain is far more real and preferable than any inner existential pain.  The fight club is a gift for these men.     How does a healthy society deal with these impulses? Organized sports and game hunting come to mind. These young men also provide the raw materials for military war machines. But for those men that don't fit into the role of hunter, soldier, or jock; the draw to the fight club is understandable. But once in the fight club, how does this process morph into anarchy and terrorism?  Why do rebellious young men need to be beat and mastered by a leader? How do they come to believe that submission to the power of a hierarchy is a sign of manhood and allow their aggressive urges to be maintained and directed?    In the scene where the narrator's hand is burned by lye, we hear Freud's theory of God as a father projection. In casual conversation the narrator and Tyler discuss wishing they could fist fight Hemmingway, Gandhi, and Lincoln.  After a car wreck, Tyler says they had a 'near life experience'. Such odds and ends are woven throughout the film.    In the end, this is sometimes a hard film to watch, but underneath the satire and violence is nested essential existential questions. We may have answered many of the questions for ourselves and can sleep at night, but as a society we certainly have not answered the questions.
B000AP04OM|5.0|What a great classic. It is a great movie for children and adults. It is great to show in a music class if you are a teacher.
0060578793|5.0|I am always a bit hesitant when purchasing a book without a recommendation, online and without feeling and reading a few pages. However this is one of the good ones. Its well thought out, informative and thorough not to mention value for money. If you're looking for a all round survival book than this is the best. Only problem is that its heavy if you want to take it with you on a hike or camping.
B000VWE5OY|4.0|It's Torchwood, come on, just for Capt. Jack Harkness, I should give it a 5/5, but it won't be the case this time.    The series itself deserve 5/5. If you loved Doctor Who? and you thought: \\"A little bit more violence, drama and sexual content would have been good!\\" Well Torchwood is for you. Don't expect Jack to be the Jack of Doctor Who with the Ninth Doctor and Rose; he's still the same, but more secretive and what he learned from the Doctor reflects a lot in Torchwood. We see a little bit more of what he has become when Rose brought him back.    If you're really a fan of Doctor Who, but especially Jack, this series is for you!    So why did I gave it a 4?! The extras DVD! It's not because the extras aren't good enough, the problem is everything was separated. You've got the whole Torchwood: Declassified on one DVD instead of having one at the end of each episode. For someone who never watches it on TV it probably won't bother you, but if you're used to have it right after, it won't happen.    Except that the DVDs are amazing, lots of extras, bloopers, deleted scene, comment during episodes, English SUBTITLES (thank god! I'm still not used to the Welsh accent) and more...
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|I realize that any review is very subjective, but with this one I just had to write a movie review which is not part of my normal nature.  When it comes to movies, I would consider myself a purest, so when I find myself fast forwarding through a DVD, I feel I must speak out.  I have only seen one commentary (or how they did it), so I have no real idea on what the people who made this were thinking.  At first blush, 'Cloverfield' looks like another remake of 'Godzilla' which takes place in Manhattan, NY. However, instead of a story line shot from many different views (as a usual story), it is shot from the view of a home video camera, trying to capture what was happening to several friends during a disaster of epic proportion.  If you thought the 'Blair Witch Project' was the best movie you had ever seen, you will be blown away by 'Cloverfield', but if you think 'Blair Witch' was a looser, you still might still enjoy this version of \\"How to waste 85 minutes of electrons, without really trying\\".  If you can get past the first 45 minutes or so, it does become more suspenseful and entertaining.  I must say they did not fall for the old mistake of creating a monster(s) and then showing too much of it, which leaves much more to the imagination and heightens the scare factor.  Hindsight being 20-20, this film would have been much more enjoyable if the Handycam had image stabilization (yes I know they did not really use a Handycam). The camera man was way to much a 'whiner' and had me wasting more time waiting for him to get smushed and replaced, than concentrating on the dialogue and story line.  The idea a character could suffer life threatening wounds and then they simply run away like a fresh marathon runner was a bit campy, but at least (unlike present day Hollywood) they portrayed the US Military as human beings trying to do the best job they know how, which is very atypical at this point in time.    Ground breaking? Maybe, but they should have buried it deep after they broke the ground.

As a mother of a daughter with autism and working with individuals with autism spectrum disorders for 28+ years, he's right on in accurately conveying their view the world and the emotions and fears they encounter trying to function in our strange world. The character reminds me of a beloved young man, a student of mine, with asberger's syndrom. Best job in the world.   Loved the book, this was my third copy because I keep giving it away.
B0018J48QO|1.0|I downloaded the pilot from unbox to check it out given its high user ratings since I don't have cable.  But the series is just not for me judging from the pilot. The inner workings of the psychopathic mind is a fascinating topic up to a point and is revealed through the lead character's perspective in his every day interactions.  However, the images of chopped up bodies made this a show that I will have to pass on and deleted from my unbox player to make sure young children don't see it accidently. I like shows that are story-driven and about characters interacting.  In this show you get some of that, but the body part props and blood are a turn-off as it detracts from the story for me to the point where I just don't want to watch. I'm also not a fan of those CSI type of shows so that may be another reason why this type of drama (violent crime and bodies) like Dexter is not for me and does not appeal to me.
B000001ESF|5.0|2112, YYZ and La Villa Strangiato are 3 of my favorite Rush tunes.  I have been playing guitar for about 24 years (since age 13) and Rush has always been a great inspiration.  When you study music theory, the genius of Rush compositions can be analyzed similar to Beethoven with motifs that weave their way thru the entire piece.  These guys are genius and the power of this music will last for generations.  One more thing - the meek shall inherit the Earth.
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|Let's - ugh - for a moment put aside Madonna's embarrassing movies, her very bland picture books which she (of course) didn't illustrate, her Kaballah thing, her kissing Britney Spears (who is young enough to be her daughter: ick.), her fake Brit accent, her p-whipped hubby Guy, her face lifts, her refusual to age gracefully, all of that. She has a limited voice to say the least, but it was made for bouncy pop music and she has created or co-created some of the best ditties in pop music history although most of them in the 80s and 90s.     Like a Virgin, Holiday, Papa Don't Preach, Like a Prayer, Cherish, etc. Bloody brilliant.    Her last album \\"Confessions...\\" spawned some odd videos that had Madonna making out with people half her age - she looked like a dirty old man at a playground. But there were a few catchy tracks on the album.    This album however sounds like it was made by a machine - there is zero human touch. It's an aging star hiring \\"hot\\" producers plus some very overrated guests like Kanye West and Justin Timberlake in an effort to appeal to the downloading folks under 25 or so, but the result is that there is virtually no trace of Madonna the songwriter or the singer. Her voice is drowned in a hideous overproduced mix. Every single track is utterly forgettable.     She's almost 50 but so are Prince and Michael Jackson. Nothing wrong with still wanting to do your thing, but do your OWN thing, not someone's else's thing. You don't need hired robots like Timbaland and Timberlake, Madonna - you need to get back to the drawing board and put a great album together: YOUR album. If you can't do that then it's time to retire.    She reminds me more and more of Norma Desmond, played by Gloria Swanson in Billy Wilder's classic film \\"Sunset Boulevard\\".     Sad.

If I had actually spent money on this record....I didn't and that's all that matters.<br />The material is all rehash from every guitar solo and keyboard noodling from their 80's masterpieces of poop. (The first album was good).<br />AVOID AT ALL COSTS.........
B000F0UV0E|4.0|This is a nearly perfect collection of songs. Each cut id elegant and spare, with Harris' and Knopfler's wonderful voices supported by tasteful arrangements. It is a wonderful \\"driving late at night and thinking\\" CD. My only criticism: I would have liked a cut or two that pushed the tempo and their voices a bit. The cuts all have a similar sound and feel and tend to blend and (I think) lose some of their power. That being said, it is a lovely piece of work that will have broad, cross-market appeal.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|I adore this series. It's dark and sexy enough to hold me in with a healthy dose of one liners to keep things upbeat.

0143038419|5.0|\\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" is a true adventure as Elizabeth Gilbert travels the world in search of Enlightenment.  She beautifully shares her humanity and her vulnerability as she relaxes into her life.  Her love for languages and food are full of passion as her descriptions of both are poetic and mouth-watering.  Elizabeth Gilbert's true story and her search for well-being makes a fantastic story.<br /><br />In my own search, I have found what Elizabeth Gilbert had set out to find, in Ariel & Shya Kanes' books, [[ASIN:1888043040 Working on Yourself Doesn't Work: A Book About Instantaneous Transformation]], [[ASIN:1888043148 How To Create a Magical Relationship]], and [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]].  I love that I can vicariously live through Elizabeth Gilbert's words, feeling like I lived her experience in Italy, India & Indonesia.  And I love that I have found the life-style of well-being by reading the Kanes' books in the luxury of my own home.  It's nice that the search is over.
0671027344|5.0|This book is called The Perks of Being a Wallflower  by Steven Chbosky. It was published by MTV on February 1, 1999, and is 224 pages long. This book would best be classified as realistic fiction, and has a reading level of 4.8.    In The Perks of Being a Wallflower, the plot centers around a boy named Charlie who is in the process of finding out who he is as he transitions into high school. Charlie suffers from some psychological problems, which are later revealed to be the result of childhood sexual abuse. His problems are further  compounded in the beginning of the book when his best friend Michael commits suicide. Charlie is thrown into the world of high school with no friends. His see it as it is thought process, along with his extreme shyness leaves him very alone at his new school. One night, he decides to go to a football game, which is something he and Michael enjoyed doing in middle school. While there, he meets Samantha and Patrick, step siblings and seniors at his school. The three become fast friends, opening the plot to Charlie being welcomed into their circle of friends. They find common ties in musical taste, pop culture, and ways of thinking about the world and their future. Charlie feels welcome in a social circle for the first time in his life, and quickly falls in love with Samantha. Samantha is seeing a college boy named Craig, though it becomes apparent that if Charlie had tried to express his feelings, Sam would have had a hard time turning him down. Throughout the book, he learns a lot about himself and what his closed off demeanor holds him back from doing. He is often anxious about being left behind when all of his friends go to college, but by the end, he has realized that he will be OK. His mentor teacher, Bill, provides Charlie with a means to use his intelligence to overcome obstacles in his social life, while getting him to realize that he can do great things. While Charlie initially clings to Bill as a source of support, their relationship also develops into one of mutual respect and caring. The reader can sense that Bill is one of the unique teachers whose lessons will be life long.   Overall, this book is excellent for young readers of the junior high or high school age group. More conservative readers may object to the sexual content, homosexual relationship, or drug use prevalent in the story, but these are realities of the high school culture in this day and age. The story line is superb, and has left many teenagers bleary eyed into the night, struggling to stay awake and finish reading the story of Charlie, who they can relate to on several levels. Anyone who has ever felt out of place in their peer group or dislocated in the huge corridors of high school will surely find this book to be a source of comfort. While not the traditional coming of age story, it is a real account of what a young boy entering high school may be feeling, facing, and struggling with.

B000002UAO|5.0|With their mop top days behind them, The Beatles grew their hair even longer and entered a new phase of their musical careers inspired more by the ecletic songwriting of Bob Dylan than the 50's swing that influenced their early work.  By this time they had pretty much milked the American pop star dream for all it's worth and people wanted to see the group exit that highway and travel down a new road of artistic creativity.    The Beatles cut Rubber Soul when rock was transitioning from simple, three chord jukebox music to a true art form that was only beginning to absorb such influences as folk and jazz.  This was around the same time Dylan plugged in an electric guitar for the first time and turned his folk songs into foot stomping yet lyrically sophisticated folk-rock.  The Beatles did the same thing only with an opposite approach.  They took their already electrified pop rock sound and added the advanced lyrics of folk.  Their obvious advantage over Dylan was that they were already superstars on both shores of the Atlantic so unlike Dylan who was only now gaining a wide audience, the Beatle already had a nearly universal fanbase.  This is one of the reasons why Rubber Soul is a milestone in getting folk-rock onto a high perch of popularity.    Of course, regardless of this advantage, the album would have been widely dismissed if the music wasn't on par with the hype.  Content-wise, the album lives up to the hype perfectly.  The album consists of fourteen songs that are catchy and memorable in a pop sense but also display lyrical content, the likes of which had not been seen in pop music.  Two genuine classics are here in the form of Norwegian Wood and In My Life.  Neither song has a direct and immediately apparent meaning.  In My Life is often interpreted as a romantic love song even though it could be about love for anyone, or even anything in general.  Norwegian Wood with its cryptic lyrics completely pushed the bounderies of typical pop formula.  Many of the other songs like, \\"I'm Looking Through You\\", and, \\"Run For Your Life\\", are similar songwriting experiments that, more than ever before, made the listener think.    Songwriting aside, the instrumentation on the tracks is equally groundbreaking.  One of the first uses of the sitar appears on, \\"Norwegian Wood\\".  The sitar would later go on to be a staple of the psychedelic music of the 60s.  \\"In My Life\\", features producer George Martin playing a piano solo which is sped up to sound like a harpsichord. Again, very little if anything like that had been used on pop recordings before.    Also featured on the album is the all time classic, \\"Nowhere Man\\", a song John Lennon apparently wrote about himself that further redefines traditional pop formula.  Unbelievably, this would not be The Beatles most groundbreaking work.  A year later they recorded Revolver which twisted and broke the rules of rock and pop altogether and helped usher in the psychedelic era.  But as a starting point for the Beatles maturing songcraft, Rubber Soul is a classic that set the tone for most, if not all of their records that followed.
0375505091|5.0|It's likely the first time you browse through A Photographer's Life, you will use it as a peeping tom would use a window, as a voyeur, looking in on the lives of famous people -- and perhaps that's the intention. But then, go back and gaze at the photos as art, looking for the lighting, the mood, the context. Leibovitz's photos of herself are almost too revealing, but use them as the introduction to herself as she intended. The photos she took for Rolling Stone of rock stars and politicians are as rich as the articles for which her photos were shot.  Read them as you would the article itself. You will learn much.

0743496736|3.0|This author has written in choppy time lines before.  It is especially annoying in this book.  We bounce back and forth between early childhood, the actual event, time periods after the event, the past again, time frames prior to the event, etc.  It is very frustrating.  If she would have kept the book in chronological order I think it would have made a stronger story.    Not one of her better books.
B000JSI7AI|5.0|When I first saw Brokeback with my two best friends, I was about fourteen years old. All three of us appreciated it and were torn by the ending, (especially my friend who spent most of the movie gushing over Jake Gyllenhaal) but I didn't give it a whole lot of thought until a few months ago when I realized how powerful a film it really is. I borrowed it from my friend and watched it and it instantly re-captivated me.    I watched it about three times in one week, noticing new symbolism and meaning each time in the phrases and actions of the characters. I noticed that the looks Jack and Ennis give one another when they first begin herding together are more than just obligatory. After reading Roger Ebert's helpful and honest review, I realized that Ennis really was taught to hate himself from an early age because of his upbringing. Some Japanese amazon reviews taught me to see that, when Ennis first finds his and Jack's shirts, Jack's is embracing Ennis', whereas at the end of the film, Ennis has his own shirt embracing Jack's. One thing I noticed on my own was that, (however obvious it might have been to others who have seen the film it took me a while to get it...) in the scene where Ennis is longingly holding the intertwined shirts, he is, 'in the closet', so to speak.    This is not to say that I have reached a 'conclusion' as to whether Jack and Ennis were gay, bi or straight. I simply don't believe they need to be labeled as anything for that could very well distract from what this film really is about ~ genuine love. The harshness, cruelty and unforgiving-ness of society has crippled many, and Jack and Ennis are no exception. Taking into account their upbringing and environment, theirs was a love that never would have made sense to anyone around them, including Ennis himself. Though they may have cheated on their wives, they were cheated first by society out of what could have been an everlasting happiness. I have now realized that Ennis fell in love with Jacknot because he was gay or straight, but because it was Jack. Jack entered Ennis' life like a gust of wind and left just as abruptly and was the only true love Ennis would ever experience. It's just a shame Ennis was unable to escape his past and the way he was taught.
0375424474|5.0|This is a brief but excellent book explaining how the fossil record is supported via modern science - genetics, DNA sequencing, molecular biology and the like.  Although a bit slow in the start, it gives numerous examples of science in the 19th and 20th centuries, scientific progress has both proven and dis-proven scientific theory, and how often full understanding was hampered by lack of tools and technology.  This is a must read for anyone interested in evolution, the scientific method (as differentiated from philosophy)and a high-level understanding of the amazing confluence of sciences now available thanks to computing and modern technology.  An excellent read!
B0015AARJI|4.0|Finally, the DUALSHOCK3 is what Sony should've launched long ago with the launch of the PS3. It feels heavier and more secure to handle than the normal SIXAXIS. The plastic isn't see-through like the SIXAXIS as well.    My concern was the battery life, since it's using more power for the feedback, and thankfully it didn't disappoint me. The battery cycle lasts almost the same as a normal SIXAXIS would. The feedback is not that powerful yet not weak; somewhere in the middle. But not bad at all.    Gives your new games a better experience and refreshes your old ones (if supported of course) :)

B0016HNOXQ|5.0|Yes, Portishead has changed from 10 yrs ago.  Better?  Maybe.  Different? Certainly.<br /><br />I like NIN and the Young Gods, so I wouldn't really call Third industrial.  Industrial-lite, maybe - it is more aggressive, syncopated and polished  than their previous work.  Less trippy, less hesitant, harsher.<br /><br />Regardless, what counts is that it is instantly recognizable as Portishead.  The changes make sense and are a continuation/variation on the trademark Portishead sound.  Not just a change for change's sake.  And a less traumatic change than some other bands' attempts at variety, if you are willing to give it a try.  Now, if you do really dislike industrial, you'll want to be more careful and listen before buying.<br /><br />Also it is a very catchy album to listen to, for me.  Just loved many of the songs from the first time I listened, which is unusual for me with a new album.<br /><br />Is it a happy album?  Err... this is Portishead we're talking about, right?
B000127LW2|5.0|After the blockbuster success of Star Trek TNG and DS9 what more did Star Trek have to prove?How about being able to survive outside of familiar territory?That was the premise of Star Trek Voyager.Set in the same timeframe as TNG and DS9 the Starship Voyager is sent into the far away Delta Quadrant and,after an act of kindness Captain Kathryn Janeway and her crew are stranded-trying to explore totally unknown worlds and find their way home along the way.This DVD set marks the beginning of those adventures;finding the two different crews on the ship learning to adapt to eachother.The characters on this show are extremely well developed;gelling faster then on any Trek series before or after it.This season is also home to some absolutely terrific episods-the pilot 'Caretaker' being among them. Other corkers include \\"Time And Again\\",\\"Heroes And Deamons\\" and my favorite \\"Jetrel\\". Voyager in it's pre-Jeri Ryan/Seven Of Nine period had one of the greatest ensamble casts in all of Star Trek and because the theme of this show was for all intents and purposes surviving and being triumphant in a difficult situation. Before purchasing these DVD's I had of course seen all these episodes many times both on TV and old VHS tapes recorded from the TV. But seeing these together in such a concentrated way really brings to mind what a terribly underrated Star Trek series this was and how it has all too often been seen as among Star Trek's more compromised efforts. But I strongly encourage those who tossed aside this series originally in disgust need to re evaluate it and see it for the many,many great things it had to offer.
0811729117|5.0|I have just finished reading this very interesting book which was written from the perspective of a highly decorated panzer commander. How refreshing to read a viewpoint from a WW2 German frontline soldier. He tells his story without embellishment, there is no hollywood exaggeration here. Playing down the danger & terror which was part of the Russian front, he calmly relates details of battles he took part in, comparing the pros & cons of both the German & Russian tactics. Until the Tiger tank made an appearance at the front, the Germans had no answer to the Russian T34s & KV1s.   It was quite clear that he respected the fighting abilities of the Russians while he was less than impressed with the Americans who relied on technology rather than properly trained personnel. And for those that had the impression that the Americans were the good guys, think again. Carius confirms that the Americans instigated a harsh post war policy of starvation & neglect on German POWs.   I used to wonder how the Germans & their allies managed to fight on multiple fronts against the world's most powerful nations and hang on for as long as they did. The answer I think is to be found in this book, far from being an exception, men like Otto Carius were quite numerous in the German army. These were men who did not shirk responsibility, but did their duty competently both in attack and defence, who were resilient, tough & stoic under all conditions. Their principle motivation came from a strong sense of duty & loyalty to their families, homeland & comrades, qualities which are these days played down and even discouraged.   The book also gives an insight to the real Heinrich Himmler who listened attentively to Carius's honest assessment of the worsening frontline situation.   If you want mindless entertainment then watch Hollywood inspired movies & documentaries, if you want the truth then read books written by people who were there, on the frontline, people who survived numerous battles andlived to tell the tale.   All I can say is that I enjoyed this book enormously, and the one criticism I can make is that it was not long enough.
B0015AARJI|4.0|LIttle heavier, battery time shorter, but vibration is worth it.  Not all games have shock programmed in them, but for those that do it makes the gaming experience more interactive.  In Grand Theft Auto for example, when there's thunder, it vibrates, when you're next to the train tracks and a trains going by, you feel it, you can even set your phone in the game to vibrate.  The controller feels comfortable to use, and it's not too heavy.  It's very easy to recharge with the usb cable that comes with the PS3.  The weight and battery time aren't really issues.  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 is because it's a little expensive and not all games have vibration capability, but still, I think it's worth it.
B000H0MKOC|5.0|This film is not about smoking, so if you smoke you'll enjoy it even more. This film is about politics, advertising, journalism, religion and all the other institutions that claim the \\"truth\\". After you've watched it, you'll know the truth and will look forward to watching it again with your friends. It's better than a drug trip or a religious experience and almost as good as an orgasm. \\"Thank You for Smoking\\" is on my 10-best list.
B00011F5DK|5.0|This game can be enjoyed by the whole family.  You do not have to be able to read to play.  It is good for challenging creativity.  We have had alot of fun with this game.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|This concert is amazing, a shame she never came to Australia  with it. The best concert I have ever watched on a TV. Fantastic, amazing and brilliant. A must for any Madonna fan.
B000YKE87W|5.0|It is wonderful to hear tenor arias sung with a darker, masculine tone; it's wonderful and refreshing. His high notes are solid; he translates from forte to pianissimo with ease, on key. I have listened to this album multiple times and will purchase future Kaufmann releases.
B00154GEFU|4.0|Phoenix is a very good piece of music. Asia did not try to become a current band, they decided to remain Asia, and I'm glad they did. There are some really good songs on this CD, especially An Extraordinary Life and Heroine. There is no doubt that this is an Asia album. If you yearn for new music from bands you know, this is a CD for you.
1416955070|5.0|I read all of the reviews and let this book sit in my wishlist for a month or two. Finally I ran out of books to read and decided to give this book a chance. I was blown away by the imagery, characters, description and plot! I fell in love with Clary and Jace. I couldn't get enough of their world and can't wait for the third book! I read this in a couple days, yearning to enter their world each day as if I were a part of it. You will not want to put it down! If you must read one book this year, it should be this one (and the second, if you're hooked and want to find out more!).
B000BNX3B4|4.0|This is a predictable, yet still mostly clever, romantic comedy.  The heroine is recently divorced and not quite ready to admit she wants to start dating.  Her meddlesome family is fairly endearing, the scenes with the losers they set her up with are mostly comical, and we do start to root for the romance to blossom.  But it unravels a bit near the end.  We know she's going to go back to the hero and the delays seem forced, almost like they had leftover dating scenes from the beginning that they didn't want to waste.  The final mad dash at the end, when a simple phone call would have sufficed, was ridiculous.  And the moment she jumped in the water, the movie lost most of its credibility.<br /><br />Overall, a light movie good for some laughs, but it probably wouldn't hold up to much repeat viewing.
037571412X|3.0|At first glance, this appeared to me a misogynistic and annoying novella, but as it progressed, I found myself caught up in what became an intelligent and wonderfully insightful work about sexuality and aging and much more in between. Yes, it's a little full of itself, but then again, this is Philip Roth. Very satisfying, if unnerving at points.
0521673763|5.0|This new edition of Stahl´s easy and delicious \\"Essential\\" surprises me. Some people who doen´t like this book argues that the book is too superficial in some issues. I desagreee. The very title of the book already shows their propose. It´s a book about ESSENTIAL psychopharmacology, make it easy and beaultiful. Thanks, Stahl, for bring us, again, with this piece of joy.

B000065BPB|5.0|The headphones work great and have been well described in the other reviews.  The sound isolation is very good. With no sound on, I can still faintly make out other voices in the room, but with music playing, people have to be fairly close and fairly loud to hear them at all.  The sound quality is excellent.  They are a little bit bigger than I thought, but I'm not sure if that is a bad thing.  There does seem to be plenty of ear room and I have found them to very comfortable.
B000AP04NI|4.0|I bought the single disc version that was released in 1999 and the disc says that this is the Todd-AO version and so to fully appreciate the merits of an even wider than usual presentation, the film is shown here in a letterbox format which on my widescreen plasma tv just doesn't quite do it for me.  I have to say that the clarity is good in that it is a lot better than what I've been used to when it comes to films of that era and comparing with films like \\"Rebel Without a Cause\\" and even \\"The Searchers\\" I have to say that just the clearness and the detail really impressed me.<br /><br />The opening credits looked strange and it looked as if for me to truly appreciate the Todd-AO process I would need to wear 3-D glasses as that was what the opening credits looked like to me like one of those old movies at the drive in that required you to put on your 3-D glasses otherwise the film looked strange.  However, after the opening credits, the rest of the film was okay except that the letterbox format made the film appear really small on my widescreen and I had to sit forward to enjoy the film.  The sound quality had a 5.1 surround option and has been THX mastered but does not sound as good as other similar dvds with this option that I'd heard but it was nice to have this option anyway.  The problem is that the spoken dialogue especially at the start was occasionally very soft but the singing parts suddenly had volume increases which bothered me a bit but I guess that shows that not enough effort was put into the proper mastering required for a 5.1 surround treatment.  There are also a few frames of imperfections in terms of picture quality such as the usual culprits of white spots etc that should be cleaned up with the new and modern equipment with computers etc that they have nowadays at their disposal.<br /><br />The storyline drags on just a little but I always liked \\"Oklahoma\\" for the quality of the songs anyway and so I wasn't too bothered about that as the songs are brilliantly performed and for me still stand the test of time as all classics do.  I never grow tired of listening to them especially my favourites \\"Surrey With the Fringe On Top\\" and \\"People Will Say We're In Love.\\"  With the advent of Blu-ray, I'm hoping the powers that be will somehow adapt the Todd-AO so that we get as much of the benefits as possible but adapted to plasma widescreens as frankly the letterbox format doesn't do it for me and seems like a waste of much of the screen that is in black on the top and bottom.  Also, they have to improve upon the sound quality.<br /><br />Overall, this is still a good dvd but if they make the above improvements for the Blu-ray version, I'll certainly be interested in \\"upgrading\\".  I'm a big fan of musicals and while the storyline isn't brilliant and in fact can get a little boring at times and the music isn't the greatest ever, this is overall when you put everything together still a great musical and strikes a chord with me that I can hardly put down in words and yet it is still my favourite musical of all time.  I guess the best I can describe it is that it gives me that unique \\"Oklahoma Experience\\" just like a Jimi Hendrix performance where it's not just listening and viewing but you have to experience the whole package.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this too as much as I have over the years although you may want to wait and see what they do with the Blu-ray version.  Perhaps some techniques like the Todd-AO process cannot do justice to the viewer unless it is viewed in the way it was meant to i.e. on the large screen of a properly equipped movie theatre and so any attempts at replicating the Todd-AO experience will fall short every time on dvd?  If my suspicions are correct then I hope the upcoming Blu-ray version will have both the \\"normal\\" Cinemascope and the Todd-AO version to satisfy all camps but of course with all necessary improvements stated above included.erformed and for me still stand the test of time as all classics do.

1416914293|5.0|I don't understand why people keep giving this book bad reviews with tags such as \\"boring\\" and \\"yawn\\". And what's up with the \\"plagiarism\\"? Is there something I'm missing?     This book is the second installment in the Mortal Instrument trilogy. You're left wanting more of Clary and Jace even though their relationship seems wrong and disgusting. you just can't help but want them together. The third book is coming out next March. If you loved the first, and won't be able to wait for the third, wait to read this one or the wait will drive you mad!
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I love Gilmore Girls. It is my favorite series of all time and I had promised myself that I would buy it before I left for college so I can watch it at college. It was worth every penny. I haven't watched any of the dvds but I love to Gilmore-isms Guide that comes with it. I think I'll go watch it now.<br /><br />Thank you for your<br />time and feel free<br />to comment this review,<br />Loran
B000YENUI6|2.0|This review of Eastern Promises will be short and sweet (sorta).  With critically acclaimed reviews and high high expectations, this movie was by far the BIGGEST disappointment of any movie I have seen in the last year (besides Michael Clayton, sorry George, wrong script to choose).  I am a fan of Viggo Mortensen and think he is a great actor, but not only was his character somewhat dull but he barely said anything throughout the movie.  I know, that's a small issue.  The big issue at hand is the how ridiculously slow this movie moved.  My husband and I are movie fanatics and were bored to death watching this movie.  Also in many reviews people said the ending was a crazy twist and a huge surprise.  Well, I will compare the movie to a wilting rose, it got worse and worse as the movie went on.  If you are down with watching a movie that will bore you to tears and make you want to hurt yourself while watching the film, be my guest.  But, if you would rather spend your time doing something worthwhile, PLEASE HEED MY WORDS AND WATCH ANOTHER MOVIE THAT HAS A POINT, A WELL WRITTEN PLOT, GOOD CINEMATOGRAPHY, MUSIC, ACTING, ETC...

B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|My wife and I went to Vegas to see this show last year and decided to order the DVD this year.  Great show.
0143038419|5.0|I was reading through some of the reviews others have written for this book and felt a lot of them were unfair. I can't even imagine giving this book anything less than 5 stars. I love the rawness of it... The author did a wonderful job describing her experiences, feelings and thoughts on her journey to finding God and worldly pleasures... and a way to balance the two. I found this book hard to put down. I laughed with it and cried with it. Fantastic book!!!
