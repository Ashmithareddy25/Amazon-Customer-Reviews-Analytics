B0055MBQOM|5.0|I've been a Datacolor user and could never get consistent results. I've used the 2/3/4 Syder and would always get shifting profiles and I've used them on many different brands of monitors. Im also from the computer age and computer savy but I'm also from the tail end of the color darkroom era.<br /><br />But the ColorMunki is a WORLD of difference. Consistent and accurate results. I've profiled my monitor - sent stuff to print to print at Adorama (perfect) and printed off my Epson R2880 (which is not calibrated what so ever) and PERFECT.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|The movie was fine, another overblown and entertaining blockbuster from Hollywood. I am waiting for the Avengers/Sherlock Holmes crossover movie so I can see Sherlock Holmes change into Iron Man to help Abe Lincoln fight Vampires.
0307352145|5.0|I'm an introvert so found this book fascinating reading for two key reasons:<br /><br />1. It helped me better understand why I am the way I am. Further, Susan Cain also provides analysis of extroverts as well to provide a balanced approach. I loved the fact Susan didn't just rely on her own study of individuals rather used many other studies from various perspectives to support her findings. This included studies of the brain, which I particularly enjoyed.<br /><br />2. It's practical so I was able to immediately use some of the findings as I met with people and also in relating to my immediate family.<br /><br />A reader could easily be put off by the book's size and in-depth research and analysis. However, Susan uses a very personable style that is both informative and engaging. She writes how I imagine she talks and every sentence is very much worth paying attention to. Each chapter typically contains individual stories, drawing the reader in to better absorb the content and research.<br /><br />I'm encouraging my friends in business, in particular, to read it. But it's applicability extends far beyond business. Every teacher should read it, if there isn't anything similar. The discussion about classroom dynamics and that between parent and child were enlightening and very relevant. I have an extrovert son, so learnt more about what may drive him and I hope, better ways to interact with him.<br /><br />Highly recommended reading.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Was not a fan of the soft porn details (felt like an upgraded Penthouse) but found the storyline very Intruiging. Of the three books, this was the best I read.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Simple play with stunning graphics. I find myself picking it up for a quick 5 minutes and playing it for way more than that.
B0035XVVDY|3.0|It was good in the sense that it was thrilling and kept the audience guessing but it would have been great had the ending been tweaked a little. I felt that it fell short with what Foxx's character came to realize. Yes not to make deals with murderers but to recognize that the whole system was flawed. Had the ending left off with Foxx being in a seat of power and having to choose between what the current system is and changing it for the better, that would have been a step in the right direction. Still a good movie and one that can provoke deeper conversations among the audience.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Very slow, language not good, characters not interesting or appealing.  Difficult to finish, she should have stuck with Harry Potter.
B003MX5P20|5.0|I have no words this CD is excellent. It was a pleasure to listen his song, Cuando me enamoro and No me digas que no are my favourites.
B008WCP2KG|1.0|One of the worst movies, ever! Don't waste your time or money. Story is poor, writing even worse. Character development and engagement was also lacking.
0316228532|2.0|I was very disappointed in this book. The foul language was unnecessary, and I felt took away from the story. I have not read the Harry Potter series, but I expected more, given that her books were so popular.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I fully admit that I rarely buy books for my Kindle. I do however download free books daily. I can typically finish a book in an evening so it's just not practical to drop ten bucks a day for a new book. So it was a huge leap of faith for me to drop a whopping $5.99 for a book.<br /><br />Here you go...<br /><br />1.  You will not finish this book in one sitting or even three.  You will be grateful for this. The story unfolds perfectly and you'll love the process of figuring out what's transpiring.<br /><br />2. Prepare to be sucked in.  At one point I put my kindle down and had to mentally disconnect. My hands were sweating and my heart was starting to race.  The circumstances she's in are described so vividly that I felt a rush of panic (note to self: decline offers for underwater rescue missions).<br /><br />3.  The story is so encompassing that I found myself raving about it to my husband and 15 year old son while making pancakes this morning. About 30 minutes later my 6 year old says \\"that story you were talking about was so interesting-can you tell me what happens when you finish reading it??\\"<br /><br />4. This MUST become a movie. MUST.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This is one of those weird works that I have a hard time reviewing.  It had an interesting format, and it was certainly a page turner...you want to see what happens....but then it was like...\\"What? all this work for that conclusion?\\"  I think the author let her self out of the book too easily, and in so doing, took and interesting story and made it just \\"OK\\".  Considering that, I think she was perhaps trying to make a statement of some sort.  Whether it was about men, relationships, or life, I cannot be sure, but it left me with a confused nagging head shake...\\"What the hell was that?\\"
B007TNS6JI|5.0|so far so good. fun game havent had the need tobspend real money but im sure its com<br />ing. in which case ill just uninstall
B008OJ291W|4.0|This collection is for die-hard fans, if only because there are plenty of more comprehensive collections out there. One has to ask: Can you improve on near perfection? Why does Jeff feel the need to improve certain aspects of these songs? And why THESE songs? It appears Jeff has replaced ALL of the lead vocals with his still prime condition voice, which, amazingly, hasn't aged. The improved, crunchier Gibson Les Paul on \\"Showdown\\" and \\"Do Ya\\" are appreciated and the recordings themselves sound better recorded and mixed as if they have been re-mastered. \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" now reflects the decided upon \\"Brrruuucce\\" in the chorus if not in the lyric book, and certain keyboard elements have added a little more punch to songs like \\"Evil Woman\\". Truth be told however, most casual fans wouldn't be able to notice these arrangements if they were played on the radio instead of the classic versions. \\"Mr Blue Sky\\" ( the song ) is as close to pop perfection as possible -- the re-recording here does NOTHING to improve upon it and I was SHOCKED that the triumphant choral epilogue was removed completely! I also wished \\"Do Ya\\" had gotten a full on rock treatment and that \\"Can't Get It Out of My Head\\" had received a live orchestra arrangement. For die-hards, the energetic, exhilirating new tune \\"The Point of No Return\\" is almost worth the price of admission. Perhaps more significant than this release or even Jeff's new \\"Long Wave\\" a group of standards covers are the live acoustic performances (with 2 tracks as bonus tracks on iTunes) that he recorded for the new documentary \\"Mr. Blue Sky.\\" The promise of an entire record of live, intimate acoustic versions of Jeff performing classic ELO tracks (many can be seen on \\"youtube\\") might be the single most inspired gift Jeff has given his fans in decades. And can someone please explain to me WHY THIS MAN IS NOT IN THE ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME??? BB
B000NHQZ1S|1.0|Half Nelson is a long, boring movie that doesn't accomplish anything. There's a lot to do in life. Save yourself two hours by avoiding this film.
B009AMAKJU|5.0|Stephen Chbosky's \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower,\\" based on his own novel, is as good as moviemaking about and for young adults ever gets. There's little need for me to go into detail about the plot, which concerns the freshman year of Charlie (Logan Lerman), a shy, emotionally fragile teenager drawn into the Bohemian high-school circle led by step-siblings Sam (Emma Watson) and Patrick (Ezra Miller). Most of the people who will go see this movie already know and love the story.<br /><br />\\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" has been compared with the movies of John Hughes, but for me its emotions cut deeper than in anything Hughes ever did. The problems of these teens--particularly those of Charlie and Patrick--seem more real and more urgent than those faced by Hughes' characters. A large part of the film's emotional impact comes from the acting, particularly that of the three leads. Lerman, Watson and Miller have featured prominently in movies before (Watson, let's face it, will always be Hermione for millions of moviegoers), and have always been superb. These may well be the best performances they have ever given, and that's saying a lot. It will be fascinating to see where each of them goes from here.<br /><br />\\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" generates laughs and tears in equal measure, and it earns both honestly. For those who like the teen-movie genre, this is a gem.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|I can count the horror movies I consider to be worth watching on the fingers of my two hands, and still have a few digits left over.  I love the genre but hate the way it's been handled by untalented producers in search of a quick buck. At best their efforts are good for a mindless laugh.  At worst they're not worth watching even for their insights into the minds of angst-ridden teenagers and Romney supporters.<br /><br />Fortunately, every once in a while a true gem like this film comes along.  Set in a dreary wasteland, it tells the story of Owen, a 12 year old boy who's tormented both by bullies at school and his own feelings of powerlessness.  Into his life comes Abby, a creature who is cursed to an unending existence of feeding on human blood. The two form an uneasy friendship, which is complicated by Abby's unwillingness to share much about herself.  She offers Owen things he has never experienced before: encouragement and acceptance.  Under her tutelage he musters the courage to fight back against the boys who abuse him.  He also takes his first tenuous steps towards manhood, driven partially by his attraction to his new friend.<br /><br />As the plot develops, we never know if Abby really cares for Owen or is simply grooming him to serve her own dark purposes.  They're both drawn deeper into each other's worlds as the plot develops, until Owen is confronted with Abby's true nature.  He must then decide if he will fight her, flee from her, or learn to embrace her as she truly is.  The climactic scene is a masterpiece of understated menace that sent chills through me.<br /><br />Moderately explicit (by today's standards) in terms of its gore content, the scenes of graphic violence are used artistically, not gratuitously, and there is no sex.  But there is a powerful theme of seduction, which is illustrated masterfully from one scene to the next.  This film is an outstanding example of supernatural suspense that will be appreciated by discerning viewers.  Veryhighly recommended.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app on my Kindle Fire! Works so much better. than going through the Internet.  I had trouble pinning stuff before now it works great!  Great way to kill time or find a new recipe to try.

B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I fell in love with Mr. Cohen's words and his music one night while I was in Detroit getting ready for bed. His London concert was on PBS. I purchased his DVD and CD's and play them every day. It brings me comfort.[[ASIN:B001RTP3Z0 Live In London]]

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love it. It has a wide range of levels for players of all skill sets. We have it on all of our devices and everyone in our family can use it.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I have just purchased this movie, and I am from the UK, as 2 of the 3 discs (2D & 3D) are region free, plus all of the extras that we Britons did not get, I have to say the Film is fantastic, plus with no cuts, again unlike the UK copies (Bad Disney!) so I shall order as many Blu-rays from Amazon.com. To sum things up, BUY IT!!!!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|The port from a Java base PC/Mac OS to Android is almost flawless. Those who play the desktop version of this game, may think that the controls needs a little work. But overall a good game to play if you don't have access to the regular mine craft from a desktop.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I enjoyed Ken Follet's first book in the Century Triology, but this one is much more exciting, especially the parts of the plot in Germany and Russia during WWII.  While certainly not great literature, the book does convey an accurate taste of history during the 1930's and '40's all over the world.  I bought \\"The Fall of Giants\\" (Book 1) in hardback, and it was so heavy to hold I decided to use my Kindle for Book 2, which worked out much better.
B007R4WENS|5.0|So, I'm learning an old school EWF joint and come across an A13th chord. Hunting for my much used chord book is fruitless. I look up this app on my Kindle and try it out. BINGO! Found the chord with FOUR inversions in a snap! The chord dictionary was so easy to use. Love the app and purchased it!<br /><br />-- B4
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a great game once you know how to play it.  Great way to spend huge amounts of time bluiding your own town.
B000ID1IYG|4.0|I suspect rarely does a day go by that Amy Locane doesn't fondly recall being on the set of John Waters' 1990 musical romance and having Johnny Depp teach her how to French kiss up at Turkey Point. \\"You just open your mouth, and I open mine, and we wiggle our tongues together.\\"
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|keeping up with all our childhood Comic Heros is getting easier & better with time- this is no exception, just wish it could have been longer !
B000I174QO|4.0|This surreal 1993 fantasy from director Emir Kusturica is less about plot and more about the characters created by Jerry Lewis, Faye Dunaway, a fascinating Lili Taylor, and Johnny Depp himself. I can't think of anyone I'd rather watch tagging fish, selling Cadillacs, and making chicken noises while dressed in a petticoat.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very useful, calculates remaining battery and charge time.  Would recommend to all Kindle owners.  Plus, it's free, you can't beat that!
B000UZNRS2|5.0|I really liked this. I felt it was much better than \\"The Camel Club.\\" It had the duel plots that were carried to conclusion in an interesting, page-turner fashion. I would definitely recommend it for a fun thriller.
B007PFD90G|5.0|My favorite books are biographies and memoirs. This is one of the best in the latter category. I remember the controversy over The Satanic Verses. Mr. Rushdie provides great insight into both his painful struggles and the political intrigue surrounding the fatwa. I highly recommend this to those who appreciate good writing and support freedom of speech.
B00846REIS|4.0|Not quite as good as “shades“  but not bad!<br />I will definitely read the next chapter!  This one actually ended too soon.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|this is a fun match 3 game. the graphics are crisp and the gameplay is fun. I'm still in the first world so I don't know how well the story progresses, but I enjoy match 3 games that have a plot and a purpose.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Well worth the read. Sad to see the govt. is putting handcuffs on this special unit. Something is very wrong when we worry about how one group of fanitics will react instead of guarding and caring for our own. Hooray for the men and women of our military and shame on the politicians.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is great for kids of all ages and the difficulty level isn't that challenging which make its fun. there are types of games for any type of person.
B001PJ1RTI|5.0|Some of my all-time faves (e.g., Kid Charlemagne, Green Earrings) done in the style I heard live at Tower Theatre (Philly) coupla years ago. Nice, clean recording. Permanent spot in my phone for travel listening.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I didn't realize Kristen Stewart acted this movie, It looked like she was sad, waiting for her vampire to arrive all the time.<br /><br />A nice start for the story every one knows about, but failed to deliver with inconsistencies of the main character and the lack of acting.
B0099G3I96|5.0|Even though I have not been a fan of No Doubt in the past, this album has changed all of that. I will enjoy this music for years to come!

B004J64QSI|5.0|Great, best musical ever. We have seen this in London twice and can't wait to see it live again if it ever comes to a area near Jacksonville.
B000002U8G|4.0|I just listened in its entirety to this album , and proves to be one of the 70 s best and finest contributions to ' modern ' music<br /><br /> The Floyd made every album an original and incomparable showcase of music and fine melody ...  From the US , Miles Davis is one of the finest that qualifies - to I and many - as a great musician and artist of this type ...<br /><br /> Actually its too many outstanding artists to name here , that exemplify originality and quality<br /><br /> ( et. al ) The Allman brothers , The Grateful Dead  Phish .  Widespread panic .  The beautiful female singer Madonna etc<br /><br /> Artists usually try and make an impact on people´s view - in this case - of music ...  The Floyd certainly executed this in a very fine way back in the early 70 s<br /><br /> Arica , Chile
B008220C92|1.0|When I first seen the trailer for Sinister I had high hopes, after seeing this non-scary movie I was disappointed. The movie was long and pointless with no gore and no nudity can't understand how it got a R-rating it should have gotten a PG instead. A boogieman makes kids kill their family then boogieman takes that kid in the end, and you don't really see the boogieman. A couple years back horror movie were gory, action, and nudity such as: Dawn of the dead remake, Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, Texas the Beginning, Rob Zombie's films all were good and gory, Friday the 13th remake, Slithers etc. plus we can't forget the classics from the 80's. Sinister is not scary, it sucked! I hope we start seeing better horror movies and not pointless boogieman crap!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Bought the Pro version to reward the developer for a well thought out and useful program. Delivers all the promised functions.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Great DVD. Got me caught up on the series. It helps to know the story line in it's correct order.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|I'm only half way through the book, but I'm still waiting for the connection. Each chapter is a short story that is later mentioned in subsequent stories, but there is no logical connection between the stories. I am hoping it will pull together at the end.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I love this game! It actually makes you think even. Hurry with more levels please. Want to play some more. Great time waster!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|very fun and I end up losing myself in game not realizing an hour or two has went by. great graphics and music.easy navigation around the game as well. I would reccommend for any age group.
0525953728|5.0|This is a wonderful book! After having read it, I really appreciate the hard work and the sacrifice by the SEALs. They put their lives on line for a job well done. They are the true heroes of this great Country.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This HBO series is intense, emotional drama at its gritty best.  I was moved and inspired by this story of tragedy and triumph during the horror of war.
B0090EIILU|2.0|hard to watch; Peter Sellers would not approve of this Trash. SO far, SACHA is a one-hIt wonder:( PASS on it and Rent Taken :)
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book  was a very good book and i cried quite a lot throughout the book. the whole story line was what i thought was so great. what made me get the book was the movie preview and i don't really understand how the producers will make this into a pg-13 movie, but ok.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Not the Rowling I know and grew to love. Such a complete letdown. 15% through the book and none of the characters were interesting enough to make me want to read more. I don't usually leave books unfinished, but unfortunately this is one of the very few that belongs to that pile.
B007TK77QE|5.0|JK Rowlings new book has achieved her objective of being a long step away from the Harry Potter series.  It is a gritty novel which is unyielding to sentiment.<br />Her characterisations are razor sharp and the story line doesn't deviate from the over-riding self interest of the inhabitants of a small English village nestling and struggling against the neighbouring urban modernism. It's not a place that anyone other than a born-there inhabitant would willingly migrate to - if they knew in advance what it's really like.  It puts the ideal of rural English village life to the blow-torch.<br />In particular, the language of her teenagers resonates with authenticity and lends a veracity to conversations which other authors struggle to achieve.<br />In the end you hope that the people of Pagford will take and build something positive from the three deaths which provide the focal points for the story but, knowing how their prejudices and selfishness drives most of their life decisions, you are left with your own optimism or pessimism as the expectation which will prevail.
B0011XBLUS|4.0|My husband and I love this movie. The music is good the story is great the acting is good too.
B00004CX83|1.0|received on time but the dvd wouldnt play. I did not return bc the cost<br />to return and all of the hassle.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Although it took me a few chapters to become engaged with this book, I am now looking forward to every opportunity to read it.  The characters are well developed.  Although one can sense where the story is leading it stills hold my interest.  No doubt this will end up on a best-seller list.
B007KOYEOC|4.0|I think this book is the best of the three as it has more things happening other than the sex.  This book does keep me wanting to read to find out how they (Christian & Ana) get out of certain situations.  Its more gutsy.
1449410243|4.0|Unlike his last book, this one focuses mainly on cat-related material, giving this one a central theme unlike How to Punch a Dolphin in the Mouth. I liked the variety of material, inclusion of all the BobCats stuff, as well as some stuff I haven't seen before. The printing is high-quality and glossy, and it's a really good experience to hold the physical book in your hands. Well done!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I had to download this onto my Kindle Fire. This game is very addictive. I already have this game on my Evo 3D and once I start playing, I lose track of time. It's so much better playing on a bigger screen. The graphics are beautiful and not cheesy looking at all IMO.  I am glad that I got it as the FAOTD. This is a must have app.
1449382673|2.0|I bought this book due to the good reviews and a recommendation by a colleague. For some, the style of this book series seems to work just great, for others like me it does not work at all. That fact is important to know before buying this book. The pages are full of pictures or look like wild diagrams on a white board during a lecture, and for me this is really hard to read or work through. The information on some of the pages could have been written down in one or two clear sentences rather and I would have grasped it just as easily. Or even easier...<br /><br />So before buying look at this book yourself first. For some it seems to work just great, for others like me not at all.
B0067QPVJ6|3.0|I loved the remake of 'The Thing From Another World' by John Carpenter back in 1982, I saw it a year later in 83 when I was 13 and it totally blew me away, sending me into a Carpenter frenzy back then (when his work was still quality with classics such as Escape From New York, The Fog and Assault On Precinct 13 etc........ man I must have watched them until the VHS tapes wore out).<br /><br />This, whilst it can't seem to make it's mind up whether it's a prequel, a stand alone or even a remake, is actually not a bad sci-fi monster flick if you take it as it is.<br /><br />Yes, it lacks much of the menace, feeling of isolation and fear of who is and who isn't of the 82 film and yes, whilst it tries to tie in certain parts or explain why and what the Americans find (Kurt Russell et al) when they arrive at the Swede's (they're Norwegians MacReady......;) base later, it then proceeds to make errors in doing so from time to time.<br /><br />Examples that springs to mind would be the Americans finding video footage (in 82) showing the Norwegians using thermal charges to blow up the ice and thus exposing the ship (the same footage funnily enough used in the James Spader film Alien Hunter) yet in this we see the engines of the spaceship melting the ice and why didn't Russell and his chopper crew find the snow cat that would be left parked next to the ship according to this prequel. Also they clearly have technology here (microscopes etc), well in advance of the Americans in 82.<br /><br />They make reference numerous times about never being alone with one another just in case one of them is 'The Thing' and yet time and again we see two people undertaking tasks together....huh??!!<br /><br />What seemed oddest for me and why I mention remake above is that many of the dialogue exchanges and even situations the characters find themselves in, almost mirror Carpenters exactly and I couldn't for the life of me understand why they did this.<br /><br />The CGI perhaps isn't up to par in realism as Rob Bottin's latex and liquid FX, but whilst not as err.... well.....gooey, it, for me wasn't terrible, just........ different I guess.<br /><br />Many reviews I read prior to watching, slated the fact the alien appears almost unabashed and pop out at the slightest provocation, however it did seem to become more cunning as the film progresses and this may account for and explain it being more covert in the 82 film.<br /><br />As I say, there are plot holes aplenty here but most movies seem to have them these days and to be fair even the '82 Thing has it's flaws, but if you watch this as perhaps more of an 'homage' than anything else and really just for an exciting sci-fi alien monster movie then I don't think you will be disappointed.ar in realism as Rob Bottin's latex and liquid FX, but whilst not as err.... well.....gooey, it, for me wasn't terrible, just........ different I guess.<br /><br />Many reviews I read prior to watching, slated the fact the alien appears almost unabashed and pop out at the slightest provocation, however it did seem to become more cunning as the film progresses and this may account for and explain it being more covert in the 82 film.<br /><br />As I say, there are plot holes aplenty here but most movies seem to have them these days and to be fair even the '82 Thing has it's flaws, but if you watch this as perhaps more of an 'homage' than anything else and really just for an exciting sci-fi alien monster movie then I don't think you will be disappointed.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|Hoping this would be aligned with the terrific job that Burton and J. Depp pulled off with \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" sorely disappointed.  The best I can say is my time wasn't completely wasted, but the one liners of Barnabus did not make a good movie, won't watch again.
0525952926|1.0|I'm a big fan of Ken Follett, but this book fell well short of his usual fascinating portrayal of history.  I'm having trouble even following the characters, partially because  of the erroneous labels he insists on using for all the villains in the book.  All the bad guys, the racists, the union busting factory owner, who happens to be a Russian immigrant, who made his money selling illegal booze during the prohibition, as well as the Nazis are all \\"conservatives\\" and \\"right wingers\\".  In reality, the racists, the immigrants and even the booze runners were mostly Democrats, like Joe Kennedy.  \\"Nazi\\" stands for National Socialists. Both Henry Ford and Charles Lindbergh were liberal Democrats and famous Nazi sympathizers.<br /><br />I haven't finished the book and I am not at all sure that I will. It seems to be written for impressionable high school students, who will believe anything they see in print.  So far, the story is completely told from the point of view of the children, but it is the adults in the story who seem to have a one sided view of politics, which labels all the evils of the world as \\"conservative\\". All the protagonists are the socialists, anarchists, and union organizers.<br /><br />Here is an example of the almost irrational political bias that is sprinkled throughout the book.  It borders on hate speech.<br /><br />\\"Most Conservatives are soft on Fascism, I imagine.  They see little wrong with killing Communists and persecuting Jews.\\"
B00992CF6W|5.0|I was just wondering if you had to have a premium membership in order to actually play on the pocket edition ? please answer.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|Definitely worth reading, Dracula is one of those books still essential in any reading list. It is something interesting to look back and be able to pin point what vampire elements are changed and which stayed the same with time.
1616960922|4.0|It was interesting reading this and Legion very close together.  Lots of overlapping themes about what makes a person \\"themselves\\" and how to use personal memory and knowledge of the past to influence and shape the future.  I'm pretty intrigued by neuroscience and the psychology of subconscious decisions right now, so these themes are really timely for me.  Of absolutely no shock to anyone familiar with Sanderson, of course the story is interesting, the characters well-drawn (Gaotona reminds me of Tim Gunn from Project Runway), and the setting is settled, real, and only occasionally fantastic.  I will say that I'm impressed that so much philosophical and spiritual musing manages to get conveyed in these tiny little bite-size reads, considering that Sanderson's other major fantasy works are pretty solidly on the tome end of the scale.  That I wasn't expecting, and am quite happy about.<br /><br />As for physical quality - yes, this is paperback, and yes it was a bit expensive, but I like my authors to make money, and I'm willing to pay it for a good story.  The cover art (and the interior chapter plates) are beautiful, the binding is secure, and the paper is decent (not high) quality.  There are no annoying typos or printing glitches, and I'm very satisfied with it as a physical item.  That said, hardcover edition please?  Perhaps with Subterranean like Legion was?  I'd buy it again... just sayin!

B005LAIHY0|5.0|Sc-fi fans are the biggest whiners of them all.... Just like those who trashed TNG's Insurrection and Nemesis, the Prometheus whiners are ccomplaining because all of their expectations haven't been met.... To be honest, Prometheus is certainly not at the same level as Forbidden Planet, but it's not that bad....the visuals were incredible (on blu-ray) and the sound was amazing.... Sometimes people expect too much from a film and then they end up not getting what thry are looking for....one should view a film by letting it tell the story instead of trying to bend it to fit your needs....when you do that you just end up hating it.... This film was pretty cool....you just need to open your mind a little and let the film serve its purpose, otherwise you will never see what the rest of us see....
B009CPJHY4|3.0|It changed to dark comedy after being funny and light at the beginning.  Several people had told me how great a movie it is.  I was disappointed.<br />My wife liked it less than did I!
B0042AEOG0|3.0|I ordered this Christmas CD primarily for one song on it.  \\"All I want for Christmas is you\\".  I liked this song and bought the CD regardless of what else was on it.  So, I am pleased with it.  As to the rest of the songs on it... A lot depends on what YOUR age and musical interests are.  My interests reflect my old goat image.  I like traditional, old fashioned Christmas music and have very little tolerance for the loads of no talent modern singers wailing away with their jazzed up versions of \\"Oh Holy Night\\".  I can do without that.  There are 13 songs on the CD and I \\"PERSONALLY\\" like about 4 of them very much (including \\"All I want for Christmas is you).  Many are refershingly new and amusing in their style.  About another 4 are \\"okay\\" in that they are the usual rendition of whatever song is playing at the moment.  Some, Mariah sings reasonably well, some other's are a bit overdone to MY taste.  The other's I hit the \\"skip\\" on the remote control.  Some of the songs are NOT what you might think.  \\"Santa Claus is coming to town\\" is not your basic holly-jolly sugar filled song but more of a modern, lively rap song.  Very entertaining I found but not your old fashioned version you might be used to. Several other songs with familiar titles are the same.  This is NOT your grandfather's Christmas album!<br /><br />If you are a younger person, used to the modern tempo of the Christmas season, I think you will enjoy the mix of music on this CD very much.  If you are an older person, looking for a \\"cozy\\" traditional mix of Christmas music, I think you may want to shop else where.  Unless of course, like me, you like her song \\"All I want for Christmas is you!\\"  I heard her sing it once at \\"Christmas at Rockefeller Center\\" and I enjoyed the program and her singing of it enough to seek out the CD just for that one song.
B00785P2QC|5.0|really good game. connecting the buildings can be confusing and it is hard to build up money but I like it a lot.  It is hard to run out of energy so that is good too.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|This show is off the chain with unforseen events.  I pride myself on being able to predict aleast 1 or 2 twists/turns in a plot of a show.  But not this series.  This show may not get as many accolades due to the language and etc..., but this group of writers, actors and producers are the best ...bar none!!
B00499NHLC|5.0|Sherlock Season 1- The acting is superb. The story lines are well written, bringing the tails of Sherlock into the 21 century. The only thing that I can begin to fault is that there are not enough of them. Please keep up the good work!
006621131X|3.0|I think this book would be best enjoyed by a reader who lived through these times or is very interested in the artists of the era.  While I really enjoyed the snapshots of New York City, the constant references to the budding artists and celebrities of the day left me frustrated.  I knew that I was missing a lot of important points due to my lack of knowledge.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is beyond addictive. I can easily sit down for five minutes or  however long until I am out of coins. It's great that I can put it down and not worry about losing anything.
0312430000|5.0|I bought this book after Bill Gates suggested it on his Facebook page. Since Bill Gates suggested it, I had high expectations from the book. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The author is a world famous surgeon, an expert in public health, and an expert in safety in surgical procedures. He is one of the main person behind a check list published by World Health Organization (WHO). This is the main thread of the book. The author explains how he has come to finalize the WHO checklists. He explains what a checklist should be like. It should not include all the details. But it should include steps which are critical and which people tend to ignore. In addition to taking care of the critical steps, there are some steps which help in team bonding and better team work. The checklists was tried in 8 different hospitals around the world. It resulted in significant reduction in post surgery complications and fatalities. The improvements were observed uniformly across all the hospitals irrespective of the fact if the hospital was in a poor country or a rich country.<br /><br />A significant portion of the book deals with the usage of checklists in domains such as high rise building construction, aviation safety, investment, and decisions by venture capitalists. The author has given very interesting examples from all these fields about the usage of checklists. I specifically liked one example related to aviation safety. The example talks about how one polar flight had developed trouble. First time it could not be made sure what the trouble was but a theory could only be proposed. Based on this theory, a checklist was prepared to deal with the problem. After some months the same problem occurred again and it resulted in resolution of the problem. The theory could also be verified. I am not giving the details so as not to spoil the fun for potential readers.<br /><br />The overall message of the book is that though checklists sound boring, but they can be really effective in accomplishing complex tasks. This is because a well prepared checklist makes it user a disciplined person.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is one of the best sequels I have read. I am looking forward to reading the final book in the series.

B008XG1X18|5.0|WARNING: This app will not only cause frequent acts of craftiness and creativity, but dry eyeballs and time warping due to endless hours of scrolling.......
0375703764|1.0|Like the others in the one star category, I really tried to like this book. I'm lucky that I picked it up from the library and can return just as quickly, but I wish someone would explain to me how this is characterized as horror? As a self proclaimed horror buff, I feel qualified to judge horror, but this was boring to me, vaguely familiar, and hard to read. Literally.....It made my eyeballs hurt. The type was too small and the hype too big.<br /><br />Being a fan of all genres of horror and science fiction, I can say if you like a good plot, with meaty and logical complexity, then this is not the book for you. While insanity is intriguing, it's the kind that's not readily apparent that's the most horrifying. It's the subtle sense of imbalance, of \\"wrongness,\\" in a story filled with normalities amidst good writing, unique ideas and a glimpse into the madness that we all see in our own minds at our most terrified.<br /><br />If you're the kind of reader that doesn't enjoy headaches, likes Peter Straub, the Borderlands series and likes a good ghost story, then this is probably not the book for you. I don't need to hold a book upside down to read a portion of it because the author thought it mimicked the disorganization of insanity.....those of us familiar with true, terror inspired insanity know it's never as neatly obvious as Danielewski would like us to think.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I found this book to be a great disappointment.  The writing was excellent but the story was very unimportant except to the characters themselves.  Rowling killed off the only truly likeable characters at the end.  It was difficult to remember all of the characters and keep their relationships straight.
0307474275|2.0|Dan Brown made a mint with this 2003 potboiler about a race to uncover a 2,000-year-old secret, and you have to credit him for making it entertaining. It isn't at all plausible even outside of the specious history involved, but at least for the book's first half you flip pages too fast to notice.<br /><br />When the head of Paris's Louvre museum is found dead in a crime scene that can be mildly characterized as \\"unusual,\\" Harvard professor Robert Langdon finds himself the lead suspect. Even before this has registered, he is already being led away by one French detective, a woman who has her own secret reason for believing Langdon's innocence. Can they find what sparked this murder before the murderer finds them?<br /><br />Calling \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" a history mystery oversells it in the history department by a long chalk, but at least through the first half, it works pretty well as a mystery. You get caught up with the twists and turns Brown throws at you, as Langdon and his companion Sophie struggle to stay one step ahead of the law, in particular a credible Javert-type whose reasons for wanting to catch Langdon seem to involve more than one murder. Add an albino monk with connections to the strict Catholic order Opus Dei, and the result is a pretty good runway for adventure.<br /><br />I'm not sure where the book goes wrong. Brown's prose style has been attacked by better writers than me, and to be sure it leaves a lot to be desired. There are way too many flashbacks awkwardly inserted into the narrative to make various claims about the Holy Grail and the nature of Christ, not to mention the backstories of various characters and even entomology lessons where characters ponder the double meanings of words. All of this bogs things down considerably. Once you get to the second half, and in particular the wind-up, the one thing that was working, the plot, becomes very convoluted, with implausible coincidences and surprise revelations that give the entire book the makings of a bad joke.<br /><br />And in regard to the \\"history\\" of \\"The Da Vinci Code:\\" It leans on a series of suppositions which range from the validly conjectural (does Da Vinci's painting \\"The Last Supper\\" show Christ with a woman?) to the silly (Mona Lisa's a man, baby!) to the downright ridiculous (a secret order working against the Vatican that involved such figures as Da Vinci, Botticelli, and Isaac Newton). All this Brown presents in the narrative with a kind of grim poker face, as if everyone who is anyone already knows this. A quick internet search reveals this is wrong.<br /><br />But okay, he makes stuff up. It works during most of the book, anyway, provided you're a cultural doof like me who figures I don't know this because I'm not well-read enough like everyone else. The problem really comes at the end, where after an implausibly neat resolution of the chase, we get some final words about the nature of the big maguffin these guys have been seeking that reveals it to be exactly that, nothing but a nod to an \\"ethereal nature\\" and a hint of a sequel to come.<br /><br />It's here \\"Da Vinci Code\\" becomes a real let-down, because it loses the courage of its ruse and big build-up. Give Brown credit for playing with our minds, but he does less with the result than he could or should have, his making fiction of fact becoming just an end to itself rather than a springboard to something of significance or at least lasting entertainment.ings of a bad joke.<br /><br />And in regard to the \\"history\\" of \\"The Da Vinci Code:\\" It leans on a series of suppositions which range from the validly conjectural (does Da Vinci's painting \\"The Last Supper\\" show Christ with a woman?) to the silly (Mona Lisa's a man, baby!) to the downright ridiculous (a secret order working against the Vatican that involved such figures as Da Vinci, Botticelli, and Isaac Newton).

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I liked it a lot because I can play with my kids. I like to draw. I liked the variety and options,  especially coloring  and easy erasing.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I   have to admit i was not impressed with the first book, there were too many similarities to the 50 Shades series. However, I found Reflected in You much better reading and I‘m looking forward to Entwined with You
B009GEEMLY|4.0|It was a great movie and I really like how the movie brought in all of the superhero's story.  One can watch it even if they hadn't seen the other movies but is better when you have all the information.
B004UID2LC|2.0|I really liked it at first. It was easy to use and fast. A while after using it,  it started to act funny. Things wouldn't download, or it would close randomly. Now it won't do ANYTHING at all.
0307895475|5.0|This book does everything one could expect from a good guide. Well written, concise, and good layout. No complaints on this end. Keep up the good work Prima.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|I rate it a 4 star because once I got into the story, I didn't want to put it down.  But, I have read better.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|It you're a true fan of the 50 Shades books, then this is a must have.  It really gives you the feel of \\"being there\\".  You can almost feel Christian at his piano....and the music selections are beautiful!!
B009QW7HMC|5.0|Im stunned with this episode not a let down very fascinating with all the killing zombie action and looking forward for the following shows.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The world needs more music like this! Music that uplifts the soul and makes each beat of your heart count. I enjoy many genres of music and this CD encompasses them all. Everything from the well thought-out arrangements to the excellent production quality is first class. And not to forget their videos on youtube that are equal to, and surpasses (in my opinion), any high budget music video being put out today. These guys are just classy and you can tell when someone is creating art out of pure love and passion. Thank you for giving me a piece of heaven here on earth. This album has quickly become my favorite. I can't wait to hear more in the future!
B0099G4Y26|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy using my Amazon mP3 app, blaring Pink's new album....it has become my constant companion! Sometimes motivation is needed to jumpstart cleaning the bathroom, or one more exercise routine of the day! This album is full of Pink's typical story-telling about her love/hate/love relationship. The emotions are raw and the music kicks you into full \\"I'm happy! Take that!\\" mode before you realize it! I consider this album therapy to the soul...because we've all been there...done that! Thanks to Pink for putting it all into words for us!
B0086449YA|5.0|This most underrated of musician/songwriters has produced yet another gem, this time giving almost anyone over the age of 40 something to embrace, be it the several blues numbers, Celtic-tinged ballads, honky tonk fun or the trademark folk/country flavor that has been his solo trademark.  MK is not for everyone (thank goodness) and many Dire Straits fans have remained stuck in the 80s, wishing he played the same things he did in his 20s and 30s.  This is a grown man at the top of his game, and you need to give it time, sit back with some headphones on and a cold beer or a glass of wine.  The band is spectactular, with a vast array of talented regulars and guest performers playing together seamlessly. Ask 10 MK fans what their favorite 3 songs are from this offering and you will almost assuredly get 10 different answers.  I've changed my mind several times.  I'd say 17 of the 20 are keepers and the other 3 aren't that bad either.  For me, Haul Away, Yon Two Crows and Dream of the Drowned Submariner are instant classics and Miss You Blues, Radio City Serenade, Seattle and Redbud Tree are fantastic as well.  The title track is another solid song similar to Way Aye Man from the Ragpicker's Dream album.  Corn Beef City will get stuck in your head and as a 50 year old the track I Used to Could could be my theme song.  Don't let the high price scare you off, although I would imagine if you like Knopfler chances are you can afford to pay for the double CD.  Money well spent.
B009FZZK8I|1.0|I bought the episode pass, so where's the first episode? All I'm seeing is the \\"Inside the Walking Dead\\". Am I missing something or does this really not make sense? I would think there would be something that says the next available episode will be ready to watch at this time. Nothing though.
B008I34YYY|5.0|Best genre movie about Nazi's EVER. I was thoroughly entertained and<br />appreciated the high degree of special effects used(not like a \\"Nazi Bikini<br />Zombie\\" b movie that I feared might be the case). Great<br />characters and story. Since 99% of Nazi movies are boring and serious<br />this movie was a fun breath of fresh air. But I can see people who like<br />to watch overly serious films would give it only one star when they<br />discover this wasn\\"t \\"based\\" on actual events(or was it?).
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|The game is very fun. But, the text is the game turns to white boxes.I have to exit the game and return when this happens.
1476715904|5.0|Slammed was a great novel that had me in tears and in awe. The story line was not what I expected, which made it that much better! I loved the devoted characters and the passion that they held. If you've read this, then you must read Point of Retreat!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Very nice game that gets harder as you go ........Hard but is a challege.....Play alot...Good for kids and adults'alike...try it you'll like it.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Fun game!  Great pace, relaxing.  No brainer for a free app of the day.  Loads quick on mt Galaxy SII.  Probably has high replay value.
0316228532|3.0|This book is so-so. It wasn't something that I would read again. Maybe all the pre-release hype made it anti-climatic for me but it didn't hold my interest.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|The show is pretty good but Amazon sent me a damaged copy.  So here I am well and truly into the story line and the characters and mid way through the second disc it stops playing.  I do all the usual trouble shooting and then I finally contact Amazon (who were the actual suppliers) only to be told they can't replace it because I'm over my 30 day warranty.  The Amazon employee I spoke with was basically very unhelpful and now I'm looking for some other supplier to furnish my DVD addiction.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great story - I can't wait for the next ones to come out. Well written plot and character development. Another one I stayed up too late reading!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I have read many books with my Kindle and received great service from Amazon.  \\"The Wanted Man\\" by Lee Child was a disappointment after reading all his other works.  This Jack Reacher is not the Jack Reacher that I have come to know and appreciate.  This Reacher can remain a wanted man as far as I care!<br />For those of you that might read this and think Nebraska is like Child describes, don't believe it.  He doesn't know Iowa any better.  Nebraska weather doesn't build from east to west.  Enough!  Sorry, it just isn't up to his other Reacher books!  Tarzan
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Judging by the title this book seems dumb. But actually it is full of twists & turns. The book really gets ur emotions going. I absollutely luv this book & im 13yrs old. So please read this book. :D
B007TNS6JI|4.0|this is a great game I play it whenever I can. I am 13 so when I get out of school and on weekends I am playing.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed the 2nd book but thought that the ending was abrupt!  Of course, that works well when you can't stop reading them!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|it's a fun game - but you go through the energy points too fast and it takes too long to reenergize
0307454568|5.0|I purchased the book used and it came in excellent condition. Being the third book I was eager to dive in and read. Was exactly what I was expecting. Really happy with this purchase. Will be making sure to purchase more of the used idem's on Amazon.com.
B000FC13Y0|1.0|Awaiting feedback on really terrible formatting errors in the Kindle edition (as in, it's currently unreadable). Will update if anything changes.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|An updated detailed romance/fantasy book for adults. Lots better than a Harlequin romance novel. The book moves quick and is well written.
B003ZJ70W4|2.0|was hoping it would at least show Abu Dhabi - to compensate for a really poor plot, but no, that and some views of Marrakesh was all to it
0307742997|5.0|Author Jo Nesbo has created a series of sleuth books with an original take on a protagonist, the brilliant Detective Harry Hole. Harry Hole has more than his share of human foibles, some quite major, but that's the appeal, dark and quirky. \\"The Snowman\\" is full of fast-paced action and interesting interactions of characters. If you're looking for a novel to toss in your beach bag, or read on the airplane, this is it. This reader has found a new series of books to savor. Kudos to Jo Nesbo! Keep the Harry Hole novels coming!
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I have played much better versions of Mahjong but this will do in a pinch.  Not my favorite but ok considering it was a free download.
B007SGM084|4.0|It was great for some fun ideas in the bedroom and the story was cute. I was bored of the kinkiness by the 3rd book and found myself skipping over it. I would have enjoyed it more w/ half the sex.
0307592731|1.0|Recieved this book on time- however the binding and page alignment of the book was terrible. I am reading this as part of a book club i belog to so i needed to get started to meet the deadline, and could not return it in time. The pages, when looking at the alginment have about 11 peaks in them with a gradual up and down on each point. I would not have shipped this item in this state if i were amazon.  I would have returned the book, as i purchased in in hardcover, but since i already had to start reading it... will keep it.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|like the game a lot. new way of playing a gem game. don't like the talking much at the beginning but is not a big problem. Game was free so I will not complain. keep those kind of games coming.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|I am an old time fan of naval history.  Particularly naval gunnery, and obviously the height of naval gunnery were the WWII Battleships, and the Iowa class was generally accepted to be the best we had.  I found the plot a little thin, but the special effects were great.
B000001EYO|3.0|The Big Lebowski Soundtrack was missing several songs that were in the movie but more importantly it was missing the ending credits song that was my favorite version of Viva Las Vegas I have ever heard, performed by Shaun Colvin.  I had to get this song off line and others that I found that were missing from the movie and create my own CD.  Only other CD that has the Viva Las Vegas by Shaun Colvin is the Tribute to Doc Pomus CD.  Hopefully someday the owners of the movie will release a more accurate and complete CD soundtrack for the fans.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great for boredom! 95% of games are good only a couple that I don't care for...tanks and plane games. ive had no probe with updates and speed
B0068MNO4S|3.0|I've been a fan of Shakespeare and all things Elizabethan for quite some time. I was so excited to see this movie when I learned of it. The theory that Shakespeare never wrote his own plays was one that I'd heard in college and always thought of as intriguing. I've also read several books about Elizabeth and her court so I was also familiar with many of the main characters that the movie portrays. Unfortunately the writers of the movie must have assumed that the movie's viewers wouldn't know anything about that era of history since they either distorted, changed, or even omitted many historical figures to suit their own ends. I know that it isn't a documentary, and shouldn't be treated as such. It is classified as fiction so we should allow for some licence to be taken. Honestly I've never seen a movie set during this era that was completely accurate. But the liberties taken here are the worst I've seen! In my opinion the movie's premise would be more credible if it demonstrated a higher level of accuracy with the time period. I love the look and feel of the movie, and I wanted to like this movie so much more than I actually did. Unfortunately, however, the distorted history ruined it for me.
B00498TQV8|4.0|After watching Hunger Games I wanted to see Lawrence is something else. To be perfectly frank, I thought she wasn't any better in The Hunger Games than Stewart was in Twilight, so I really wasn't expecting much from Winter's Bone.<br /><br />Well, I'm happy to say I was being snooty about her. Lawrence's performance in this movie is absolutely great. Ree is a brave, smart, doggedly determined girl trying to keep her family above water. She has to endure a lot of trial, but her character never lets you down. While the overall movie feels bleak and hopeless, still I felt uplifted after watching it.<br /><br />If you can tough out slow storytelling with minimal dialogue, you'll be greatly rewarded.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Connect the colored tubes without crossing paths & use all squares!!As tubes & squares are added it gets more challanging.Very fun,time consuming game that turned out to be better than expected!!Many levels from easy to hard!!Price was right($0.00),so what do you have to lose?Good Game,4 stars!!I like it,I don't LOVE it!!

B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|I'm sorry, I know that Emma is supposed to be Austen's comic masterpiece and it is wonderful, but it's probably my least favorite Austen novel. That said, I still like it a great deal.<br /><br />Emma is funny. If you liked Pride and Prejudice, then you'll love Emma.<br /><br />However, I like Austen's darker, heavier books, like Persuasion and Mansfield Park.<br /><br />Emma is long, far longer than S&S or Persuasion, but it's also fluffier. Emma is rich, very quite rich, so she doesn't have the problems of the Bennett girls in P&P or the girls in S&S, or even the gentler money problems of the ladies in Persuasion.<br /><br />Emma is Jane's fantasy, what she might have done if she were rich.<br /><br />If you like Jane Austen, you'll like Emma.<br /><br />If you like Jane Austen's sharp, stinging wit, try one of her others.<br /><br />V.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Rango is not truly for children.<br /><br />If you know who Sergio Leone or Ennio Morricone are, and love their work, I think you'll really enjoy this film.<br /><br />The characters are beautifully animated-whoever was involved with character design needs a raise.<br /><br />I'll echo some of the reviewers in here and state that there are two characters that are worth watching the whole film for. The voice work is excellent.<br /><br />However, if you think this is a kids film and want to watch it because you think it's something akin to slapstick with a light plot, I think you may be disappointed.  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles this is not.
B004HUE57S|5.0|This mouse is very comfortable. It took a couple of minutes using it for my mind to get used to it, but it was well worth it. The only suggestion I have for the manufacturer is for them to have the middle button default to the right-click function.
B00914JWSW|3.0|I love Barbara Streisand but this was not a Favorite CD for me. I didn't like the background talking and the songs were just ok.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun and addicting game like you see at the fairs. With that being said, just wish the coins would regenerate a little faster. Also like the fact that it builds \\"Shake Points\\" and collecting prize sets for a in-game bonus. All in all a pretty fun game.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Excellent special effects.  The story line was familiar but just new enough to be really interesting...  Only downside was Charlize's accent was unbearable at times....
B000JPRPAO|5.0|I love this movie.  I will be watching this movie many times over the next number of years!!!  So excited!!
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|As with all things Disney, my 6 year old daughter and my 5 year old niece love this movie despite the fact that they've seen it many many times. I watched with them and also enjoyed it.
B000NY12LO|4.0|I loved this book.  The second book I have read by Jodi Picoult and it doesn't disappoint.  The subject is thought provoking and compelling, leaving the reader with probing questions for ones own actions and reactions to both family relationships and those of our children in school.  Definitely makes you question,  how much should we intervene in the lives of our teenage children.  Picoult's books always leave you with deep questions about life, but are easy to read and are not too heavy or depressing even when she deals with very tough life questions. Really worth reading.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Narrative and educative at the same time. A sight on the human face of the North Korean problem as well as an overview of the situation of the last two decades in that country. A really nice book.
B00914JWSW|5.0|Superb! I have listened to this again and again and again. Sadly, words do not exist to describe her voice. So I will just write this: listen.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I like how the app breaks down exactly how much time is left for doing different things on my Kindle Fire (i.e. standby, web browsing, listening to music, 3D games, etc.) It is very handy.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Outstanding book. Captured my intrest from the first page. Enjoyed every minute plus it had a good ending. It would make an outstanding movie.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really love this game. I have a couple other card games but I always go back to Spider. Its the best.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Sons of Anarchy never disappoints. This season was as good as the others. If you like SOA you will love this season.
B00004VVND|5.0|This is my favorite movie of the 70's.I saw this when it first came out in 1973 and loved it ever since.Richard Benjamin was my favorite in the movie.The only thing I wished Michael<br />Crichton would have had more footage of Roman World in the movie. This would have given the movie more balance.Waiting for Crichton to release a expanded version with extra footage<br />he did not use in the original cut.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I have a Kindle Fire, and I got the Yahoo mail app for it. Since I got it, I use the app often, it is easy to use, and downloads fast. I give it 5 stars out of 5 stars.
B001LYD2K4|4.0|Originally recorded in 1981, this was one of Michael Schenker's more successful albums.  After initially pairing up with vocalist Gary Barden for his 1980 debut, Schenker brought in noted drummer Cozy Powell and Paul Raymond from UFO on keyboards and rhythm guitar.  The result was more collaborative song writing with better melodic ideas.  The songs alternate between metallic hard rock and power ballads.  The eight tracks on the original release contain no weak material.  This edition also includes some bonus tracks, but these are not really necessary.  The sound engineering here is outstanding.  A very solid effort.
B006LSZECO|2.0|So it would seem that everybody liked Gone Girl, but me. I did read the entire book, and that's something to say for it. The beginning - the Kindle Sample - certainly raised a question of \\"What the hell happened to Amy?\\" Let's just say that $12.99 is just too steep. Really! Somebody had said something about the WOWZER ending. Hmmm. Must have missed that one. She had two big chances to really hit home runs in this book. Both times she backed away and never really let the gennie out of the bottle. Otherwise, it builds and it builds and it seems to just go on and on and Nick seems like he will never grow a spine. Oh, woe. A little of that goes a looong way. But I kept plugging away. After all this book (Kindle, hard cover, paper cover, no cover, audio) is offff the chart. And she has more. You've probably checked them out. Do so. See if you like all this hemming and hawwing and will we ever ever get there? And where is there? It's fizzle.
B001LYD2JU|4.0|This edition is a new European remaster of Michael Schenker's first album, with quite a bit of bonus material.  Recorded shortly after the acrimonious split from UFO, most of the songs were collaborations between Schenker and new vocalist Gary Barden.  Schenker was still developing his style, which blended metallic riffs with melodic guitar and vocal lines, but did a nice job of it.  Much of the material is 1980s style metal.  Tracks like Cry for the Nations and Lost Horizons sound almost progressive.  There are also a couple of short instrumentals.  The bonus tracks do not really add anything, but the album stands up quite well on its own, more than 30 years later.  The mastering is extremely good, resulting in very clear, clean sound.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|I love Jack Reacher, but I found this book a bit slow moving in some of the chapters.  There are some parts that has no action just descriptions. Still the author has a captivating way of giving detail and background
0671027344|5.0|This book was written in a style that reminded me of Mark Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. That book was written from the viewpoint of an autistic teen. While Wallflower doesn't deal with a youth with the same background, his innocent writing style, in the form of letters to an anonymous friend, is reminiscent of that book. Charlie is a likable main character and while the writing is simplistic, it feels intentional in order to convey the naivete of the main character. There are several main characters in the book, but none as fully fleshed out as Charlie. The book references a lot of good 90s music (I almost wanted to make my own playlist and was even prompted to buy the Smiths' song referenced so frequently). Similarly, there's a roll-call of classic books in here that the young readers of this book may be drawn to. Speaking of which, there is some swearing in the book and a host of heavy topics (which I won't reveal for the sake of not giving away too much about the book). However, I think I'll let my 14-year-old read it as I have never wanted to withhold books and I am hoping that it will lead to proper discussions about the topics brought up in the book.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Most of these kinds of games there is no strategy. This is the only one that gives a great challenge.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am obsessed with this app. it is so cool to be able to find DIY info all in one spot
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is fun to play and some of the puzzles are really challenging. This isn't a game I'll play long term though, after playing for awhile the puzzles repeat and you get used to them. But while it's new, it is fun!
B0063IH60K|4.0|As many solitaire games out there it is hard to find a new game that is worth anything. This hit the spot.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Okay to rent if you have seen everything else. As Dorothy Parker once said about another actress, and which I will paraphrase and adapt,\\"Stewart runs the gamut of emotions from A to B.\\" She brought the rest of the movie down to her own deadpan level. There was almost zero chemistry between her and Hemsworth. Charlize Theron, as far as she was able to, added to the overall movie, but she can't do it alone.
B00846REIS|3.0|This was no 50 Shades Of Grey, but it held my interest none the less.  I will probably read the next book by Sonia Day.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the entire series! The first book was the best I believe! Been a while since a book has absorbed my attention so fully
B009329Y30|4.0|This is a sweet love story.  It was easy going and you felt calm and entertained.  It was refreshing and beautiful.  The actors really pulled it off.  I was so glad I rented this movie~
B0086DBE62|5.0|Because of the many poor reviews, we nearly didn't rent Mirror, Mirror.  However, my 13 yo dd, had been looking forward to seeing it so we went ahead and rented it.  I figured even if she enjoyed it, this 49 yo would not.  Despite our apprehension, we both liked it immensely.  For us, it was a near perfect movie.
B007THA4FI|2.0|In spite of high hopes, this foray into the adult genre lacked a story line that would have been expected of Rowling.  While the characters had the depth she so exquisitely bestows in her writing, I found the storyline uninspiring and the mood of the entire novel to be bitter and depressing.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite Russel Crowe movies.  The acting and action are superb, as is the story itself.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|What a waste of money.  Some effects good, others cheesy.  Nothing original, every action secquence was cliche.  And I paid for this stinker.  All hype no depth.  Ugghhh  I got ripped off.  R. Scott should be ashamed.  Worse than a Lucas rehash.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I actually paid for this game a couple of months ago. Playrix is a first-rate casual developer, I'm hoping they port more of their games to Android.  Great FAOTD, replayable, definitely download if you like match-3s.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I haven't finished watching the complete set yet, but so far, disk #1 (of 4 disks) is really great.  Pretty gorey though, but that is what makes Zombie movies/shows, well, Zombie movies/shows.  Shipping was quite fast.  Product arrived in perfrect, brand new condition.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was a pleasant surprise with twists and turns.  I wanted to continue reading to see what would happen next and see  how far the main characters would go.  It was a great read and I couldnt put it down til I was done.
0316228532|1.0|This is one of the worst books I have ever read.  There is not one sympathetic/likeable character; the book has no redeeming quality.  The profanity just seems to be gratuitous.  I really hate that I pre-ordered the book because I enjoyed the Harry Potter series so much.  Now I've paid more for this Kindle edition than for any other I've purchased.  If I had a hard copy I would just throw it away; donating it would just make it available for someone else to waste their time on.
0062127241|3.0|I had been hearing about this book for at least a year, so I anxiously awaited it's release. Many of the stories had been told previously and have been available on the internet. Like many artists, I believe Pete used his internal demons to fuel his energy to do what he wanted to do. We all have demons. I was looking for something revolutionary in the book; I never found it. Maybe what he wanted to tell is that he is human just like us. Interesting and entertaining, but not shocking.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This book is fantastic. I instantly get sucked in not wanting to put the book down. The whole time you're reading you're thinking of all these \\"what-ifs\\". City of Bones is filled twist and turns, betrayl, romance, mystery, and plenty of action for all to enjoy.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Out of all the games I've down loaded on my kindle fire this one is my favorite. I recommend this one to all
B0058YPGL6|4.0|Great show with a good story line. The characters have been well developed throughout season one and there's enough cliffhanger at the end of each season to make you want to continue watching. The special effects are a bit silly but overall it works. And the eye candy isn't bad either! Not as much skin as found on True Blood but given the channel and audience, it is enough. My only issue was with disc two getting stuck on one episode and I had to finagle around with the DVD player to get it to continue playing. Can't wait for season two to come out.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Character development, plot twists and turns made this a pretty tough book to put down. You never know who to like and who to hate. Who's in control, or is anyone in control. Who will win and who will lose. This book will leave unsure right up to the last page - and even then -??? Enjoy
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It's a simple but addictive game.  Great for filling time without thinking.  Like others, I wish coins regenerated a little faster.
0596805888|3.0|There is some good information about the science of cooking in this book, but you have to do a bit of searching to find it. It would be a better book if it were shorter and better organized. If I had it to do over again, I would have bought a different book on the subject.
B0006IEVFG|4.0|I've had the watch for years and finally the buttons stopped working, so I bought another one. The only thing I would improve is the buttons are easy to accidentally push if it's carried around loose like I do. It doesn't mess up any important setting, but it would be better to make the buttons harder to push.
B003SI605K|5.0|Great ladies night movie.  Inspirational,moving and uplifting.  Break the cycle of dependency, judgement,hate and resentment in our relationships. Breakfree and find your own sense of self worth and fulfillment in the circle of life.
1401322786|5.0|\\"Man alone measures time.<br />Man alone chimes the hour.<br />And, because of this, man alone suffers a paralyzing fear that no other creature endures.<br />A fear of time running out.\\"<br /><br />I read this and it just hooked me. The book kept me reading right through to the end. This book has some sad moments but mostly just thought provoking. Two of the characters are Sara and Victor. Sara is a young unhappy girl who feels left out and akward. I don't know anyone who hasn't felt like they just don't fit in at some point in their life. So, Sara, while seeming a little more dramtic than most, one can relate to. And Victor, Victor is a man who doesn't want to die but can see the end coming. Again, the fear of death is relatable. But I kept thinking to myself, how do I spend my time?
B009QW6ZT8|5.0|I loved season 1 and greatly disappointed in season 2 (too much stupid middle school drama and not enough zombies), and had reservations about season 3. If the rest of the season is as good as episode 1, season 3 could be better than season 1! Lots of zombies, good sets and just the right amount of drama, realistic and approtriate without being silly or boring. I'm looking forward to a good season.
B002NWRMVS|5.0|This has become one of my favorite CDs. It was delivered in a timely manner, at a great price for a new CD. My thanks to the seller, parkslopemusic. The transaction could not have been better. I'm very satisfied with this purchase.
B008A31UO4|5.0|Great book for beginners, especially for the people who had very little contact with programming. It has a very good pace and it is very easy to read. After reading this book the reader can move further to more advanced things.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The hunger games series provides a visual description of a whole world. This is a book with many political and social undertones. The books kept me interested from start to finish and was a very easy read. Highly recommend reading the whole series. The author provides rich and imaginative descriptions which allow you to fall deeper into the characters and their struggles. She provides enough twists and turns to keep you guessing as to what is happening next in the stories.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have the PC version of this game, and love it, so when I saw this was offered as a FAOTD, it was a no brainer.  The game is abbreviated, less puzzles, less power-ups, but it looks and works wonderfully on the Fire.  Looking forward to seeing it on the larger Fire!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|It is everything I thought it would be and I cannot wait till the next Book in the series to be made into a movie.
B003PIUBYY|3.0|This pressing is disappointing. Highs are literally do not exist. After buying it I found repressing from 70s and decided to try and compare the 2. This remaster sounds like there is a filter that would not let the sound to go through as it should. 70s edition, on the contrary, sound very clear. Music is superb of course.
141694737X|5.0|This book is very simple, interactive, and can be read over and over with a different touch. Sometimes when we read the book now we just make the animal noises or act out each animal.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Already looking forward to the next one!<br />Didnt stop playing til I finished! Definitely worth $1.99! Great mystery game and cant complain because I thought it was free. That is the reason I found this app.
0679731725|5.0|If I could give this book ten stars, I would. I saw the movie years ago, so I already knew the bones of the plot. What the movie couldn't reproduce, however, was the device of the unreliable narrator.<br /><br />And what a device it is. You don't realize, as you're reading a book, just how much you depend on your narrator. As your guide through the story, you automatically assume that he is telling you the truth.<br /><br />It is 1956, and Stevens, butler extraordinaire at Darlington Hall, finds he needs to add someone to his staff. Precisely, he wants to add a certain Miss Kenton, who worked there as housekeeper twenty years earlier, before leaving to be married. Stevens has just received a letter from her, hinting that she may want to return to service. His new American employer, Mr. Farraday, is going away for a few weeks, and he offers Stevens the use of his car to visit her.<br /><br />As Stevens journeys through the quaint little English towns that lie between Darlington House and Miss Kenton, his memories take him back to a different time. Before World War II, he worked for Lord Darlington, a man he revered, arranging dinners and secret conferences with politicians and diplomats.<br /><br />But it's what Stevens doesn't tell you that makes you gasp; rather than attend his dying father's bedside, he presides over one of Lord Darlington's secret dinners, proud that his efforts made it run smoothly. Instead of stopping the woman he loves from leaving to marry another man, he positions himself outside the door of one of his Lordship's secret conferences, just in case his services are needed. This is, by the way, a perfect metaphor for his existence; standing outside a door while life happens on the other side.<br /><br />And about that secret conference. Lord Darlington is a German sympathizer, doggedly trying to make peace with the people he feels were given a bad deal at Versailles. An old-fashioned gentleman and a well-meaning amateur, Darlington is letting himself be manipulated by the Nazi regime.<br /><br />The beauty of this book is that Stevens doesn't tell you any of these things. Indeed, he may not know it himself. It is during casually recounted dialogue with other characters that you find out the real events of the story, and the tragic consequences that follow.<br /><br />What an extraordinary book. It left me shattered. This is the best British novel I've read since Atonement. Recommended for anyone who loves great literature.
B008K6DU4Y|5.0|I have been using this for a almost a year now and the product works. I like the resume feature, deletion, advertising only on PAUSE mode, gesture controls. overall it works as advertised. I have not used the subtitles or streaming features. They have added a lot of options to customize the app experience to your liking.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was picked by my book club.  Every so often they will pick a mystery/suspence novel to keep me happy.  This book has an excellent twist that I didn't see coming.  The entire book club enjoyed this read.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|The concept behind this movie was great.  But the execution was poor.  The movie was extremely boring, which made it seem to drag on forever.  Also, there was no original content.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|When I was a child my mother read to me alot. I had several favorite stories that I enjoyed hearing time after time after time(drove my mom crazy).  I do the same with movies; Star Wars IV (of course), Cold Comfort Farm, anything by Jane Austen, anything Harry Potter and now this movie.  I love it!!! I watch it over and over and over.  Dame Maggie Smith, as always, makes the movie, but Timothy Spall is a joy as Tully. The other pleasant people are Mrs.Tweedy and Barkus (Alex Etel-Wormtail in Harry Potter).<br /><br />The adults are aware of war, being of age to have experienced WWI.  When youthful Tully is sure someone will know of his dad, etc. they simply let him ramble on.  They don't tell him that war can be very cruel and nasty. Tully grows more mature as his relationship with his grandmother grows.  Tully, his mom and grandmother may be in for the loss of their dad, husband, and son, but in the process they find each other.  It would be a wonderful movie for a child to help understand death.  If nothing else, it is British story telling at its best.<br /><br />Get comfortable and get ready for a great story.
B00910Y1OQ|1.0|46 of the around 60 reviews are 5 stars? And they all sound very much alike. I might be wrong, but it seems like they just flooded their app with reviews to try and boost attention.
B004RPRM46|5.0|Awesome audio. This was received in good condition. Like new. This could not have been a better product. I have referred so many people to go ahead and get this product.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Great story telling, really draws you in and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Had trouble putting it down once I started reading.
B005IQZB14|4.0|This book is a memoir about a woman moving through her grief after the loss of her mother, and coming to peace with her loss and the rest of her life.<br />I found it touching and real.  I laughed, and cried.  Her writing is so easy to read, and very insightful.  I highly recommend it, most women will find her easy to relate to.  You will not approve of her decisions, but you will be able to relate to them and understand her place and how she came to it.  I really enjoyed this author.
B000UZNRS2|4.0|Read this book before but this time I was more aware of the events and situations. Found that I must of missed/forgotten some of the earlier read. I am a great fan of David Baldacci.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I'm so happy with this! I use it for everything and I recommend it to my friends, family, and even my clients who need a little help getting and staying organized. I love that I can keep my lists all in one place, and i can access and edit them from any of my devices. I love the talk to text feature, too - very helpful to jot down all the ideas that come to me on my commute to work.
034580404X|1.0|This is an awful series-- but not for the kink. What little kink the books contain is handled poorly and without an actual understanding of the sex-- or sex in general (the loss of Anastasia's virginity as example). The heroine is unlikeable, whining, self-centered and obnoxious. I'm surprised Anastasia has any friends at all given the way she begrudges them everything and treats her family like garbage. With an interesting character, these flaws could turn into strengths to plumb the depths of her horridness-- unfortunately, she is not interesting and has all the depth of a plastic bird-bath. In addition, the author's token \\"brown\\" characters are treated in an offhand manner- as conveniences rather than people. I often wonder how dreck like this gets printed and manages to have so many people crying that it's \\"awesome\\". The success of this book (as well as Twilight and other wastes of printing) reminds me of the \\"Scrotie McBoogerballs\\" episode of Southpark.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I have spent the days wasting away, trolling through Amazons selection of books under $5, sticking to my general boycott of the major publishers for their greed, despairing of finding a book worth reading and then......holy living WTF?!  Where did this gem come from?!  I have absolutely nothing negative to say about the writing;  the story was superbly crafted and the protagonist very human. The author manages something that is almost impossible to to do: begin a book with a flash forward that contains a general outcome of the story and still intrigue the reader.  I will be recommending this book to my friends and family on Facebook.  They will buy this book!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|great series and fast streaming, had no buffering even while downloading and the quality was great as well, i even had the standard quality and not the HD
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Arena sing-a-long foot stomping banjo? YES PLEASE!<br /><br />The lad's don't disappoint on this follow up to Sigh No More. Fuller, richer sound with great songwriting.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The best book in the series and It has you hanging every time you stop. you feel like just want to read the book in one day.<br />Once you start you can never stop.<br /><br />Why should u read this book?<br />Its  the best in the series and if your a mystery book person you'll love it.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I recommend this to all hidden object lovers. one of the best big fish games ive played . Enigmatics 2 anyone?
B004FOA84A|2.0|No, not the rapper from Oakland. The game. The story line could have been better as well. Graphics were good but overall I am not impressed.
B009EEOM7K|5.0|Is all about doing what you always wished you could do but won't dare to and you need to find help within you as a different person
0765357151|4.0|It's been a while since I actually finished the title story of this book \\"I Am Legend\\" but I needed some time to think on it and decide how I felt about this story without letting my thoughts on the movie cloud that.<br /><br />First of all, I will say to anyone that has seen the movie and wants to read this book in hopes of a more detailed version of that story is going to be very disappointed.  Basically the only thing that is the same between the story and the movie is the character Robert Nevill's name.  I think if you liked the movie than you will like the story as well as long as you keep in mind that you are basically reading a completely different story.<br /><br />Like the movie, Robert has been alone for a very long time but we don't really get to see all of the bizarre loner activities he engages in in the movie.  The book is basically his inner monologue so we don't see or know anything other than what the protagonist knows.  This obviously leaves many holes in the story which is where I'm sure the movie tried to capitalize.<br /><br />I really liked this story and would just give a heads up to anyone that is thinking of reading it, that it is a very tragic story.  It doesn't end happily in the normal sense of the term but I definitely felt that it was a more realistic and appropriate ending than the movie offered.  I will also say that when I was done I was very confused on my own feelings towards the story and wasn't sure if it was dislike or just my own subconscious comparisons between the book and the movie.  However, once I gave it a couple weeks to just sit on my brain I realized I actually preferred the story over the movie.  It's so much more vibrant and deep because we truly see a normal man's way of coping with the harsh realities of a new world without all the Hollywood hooplah.
B0034G4OYA|4.0|The film opens with a loving nurturing Dracula caring for his daughter in 1895. In order to protect her from evil humans he constructs a huge castle as a refuge for monsters which include, Frankenstein, wolfman, invisible man, bigfoot, zombies, ghouls, Quasimodo etc. We then move to the present as his teen looking daughter turns 118 and wants to see the world. Before the first human shows up we already know the script.<br /><br />There were a number of fun things about the monsters that kids would enjoy but adults will find tiresome. Dracula constantly denies saying \\"blah, ba-blah, ba-blah.\\" There is one scene the kids laughed at and that was when someone pulled down the swimming trunks of the Invisible Man. He quickly pulls them back up, tells people \\"I just got out of the pool! It's cold! Don't judge me!\\" At one point the Invisible Man is playing charades, which he admits, \\"I'm not very good at.\\"<br /><br />At one point Dracula asks if humans would accept them (the monsters) if they \\"came out.\\" I'm sure there was some kind of message there.<br /><br />As an adult, I was basically bored with the film which had such great potential. 4 stars from a kids view. Not really scary or funny.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I loved this game on my iphone, so I missed it when I started using an android on the reg (XD)<br />anyway, it's a very pretty and well made (not to mention challenging) match the squares puzzle game.<br />It has crashed on me a time or too on the iphone and I'm sure I'll have a frustration or two with it on android, but it is a must have as a free app of the day
B008TRUDAS|3.0|Slammed was an entertaining read, nothing too deep or unpredictable, in fact the storyline itself was pretty predictable. What are the chances of moving right across the street from someone who is pretty much in your same predicament? down to the little brother's age...<br />It's more of a teen book in my opinion, but it is kind of enjoyable (I'm way beyond my teenage years), one of those stories where everyone is decent and does the right thing...
B009QW7HMC|5.0|After Season 2 began to become more like a soap opera than anything, I was concerned about the direction they would take this series in Season 3.  This episode has put my concerns to rest.  They have upped the ante with regards to action, suspense, and of course, more gore.  Seeing Carl begin to turn into a badass is quite welome, after Season 2 made you want to smack him in every episode.<br /><br />In short, I am no longer concerned with the direction that they will be taking the series; I am just excited to see how it will unfold.
B0099G3I96|5.0|I've LOVED No Doubt since I was 15 and this album didn't disappoint. If you are a long time fan, do not hesitate to buy this.
0316228532|4.0|So everyone knows JK Rowling wrote Harry Potter, and that this is her first adult-only novel, and that it is nothing like Harry Potter, right? I have to wonder if the shift in style, as well as the anticipated release ( and subsequent reality of the preceding facts) has prompted all these one-star reviews. Honestly people, we were warned!<br /><br />I remember watching a news special where Diane Sawyer was interviewing Rowlings about _A Casual Vacancy_, and the author specifically stated that this was a book \\"she had to write\\". She said it \\"needed to be written\\", as if there was something deep inside her that she longed to express in this book. Now this is just my opinion, but I think that \\"something\\" was a desire for truth; raw, unadulterated authenticity that can only be weaved into a story such as this. Again, that's just my opinion not the words of the author.<br /><br />_A Casual Vacancy_ is NOT Harry Potter. It is not filled with adolescent adventure, although Rowlings has placed her teen characters front and center in this book and speaks \\"loudly\\" through them  (I kind of think she cannot get away from the thought of having teens express themselves in her work; although be warned, these teens are hardcore). There are a lot of F-bombs, sex, drunkenness, drug use, etc.  It builds slowly and methodically, then drops a bombshell at the end (albeit as predictable as it was...it was still startling.)<br /><br />In this book Rowlings gives us a look into the psyche of a small town person-by-person. She not only describes what they look like, but also takes her time detailing their backgrounds, what they are thinking at a given moment, how they move, and even includes flashbacks from prior life events in order to give us a fuller understanding of why they do what they do.  The town itself even takes on a persona, as we are given its background, and a description its mood and adversaries. This kind of detailing causes the book to move slowly; it's not action-packed book by any means, rather it's a reactionary account of the citizens of Pagford regarding the \\"casual vacancy\\" available on the town council due to the death of Barry Fairbrother.  My opinion is that after knowing them all so well, thanks to the extra padding Rowlings has given us, the ending made me realize there are two sides to every story. Yes, we all know this, but when was the last time you read a book that really made you FEEL that way; one that really made you think? As I kept reading, I began to become very curious about the fate of these wacky citizens. They are so wrapped up in their small town shenanigans that they completely lose perspective and get swallowed up by their own actions.<br /><br />This is why I don't get the 1-star reviews. Although it lacks the wittiness, excitement and adventure Rowlings is known for, it really is superbly written. Give it a try, but be patient, and bear with her as she delves into the extraneous details.ok by any means, rather it's a reactionary account of the citizens of Pagford regarding the \\"casual vacancy\\" available on the town council due to the death of Barry Fairbrother.

B0091V6TF4|2.0|What are they thinking? The 50th anniversary and no Skyfall? You have to wonder about the geniuses that make these decisions. I already have two previous sets with the same songs. The only thing different is the cover! Here's an idea, a mini lp box set of all 23 soundtracks. THAT would have been a great 50th!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have this game for my ipod and loved it on it so I think its awsome to see it on here especially for the free app of the day. way to go amazon for picking a good title that I know.... :)
B008602KQI|3.0|A lot of intensity and action, but predictable sceens and the lack of a closing end performance made a good movie into a mediocre one
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book says a lot about how people interact and have relationships. that really spoke to me in a way most books only attempt
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|A good example of this kind of program, the three object match.  It works great on my Atrix 2.  Clean and clear graphics with a good interface.  Nice game play with good transitions.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Finally Amazon's \\"what you might be interested in\\" links on my kindle made a good guess. Bought this after slogging through Kiln People. Hooked me immediately and I was very stoked to see a volume 6 was out. Nice work, Hugh. Way to take the independent route as well. Wish I were a studio and could option this for a series. Give me a few years :)

B000HF0J36|5.0|My wife had ordered Deep Blue Sea from the On Demand on our cable, and to her astonishment , it was some stupid, dull relationship drama. She was furious , and so she asked me to search and oder the \\"REAL\\" DEEP BLUE SEA about the smart sharks with an action packed story and stellar cast. I decided to get the Blu Ray and was not disappointed. It has a sharp translation which brought back the chills we experienced when we saw it in the theater. For the price, it was a bagain buy. And, yes, the story ends happily for both the survivors of the film, and my satisfied wife resulting in a romp in the sack as my reward. AAA+++
B007THA4FI|3.0|I tried not to think of this book as a JK Rowling book-- because there was really just no way it could compare with Harry Potter.<br /><br />I liked this book-- it was long, and took a long time to get to the action. There really was just so much going on. The problem is that so much going on in this book-- that very few of the characters were built up enough that you truly care about what happens to them.<br /><br />The ending, though sad, was not even moving. Padford remains screwed up.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love mc and it just came out on kindle fire so before I get it I would like to know if its the full version plz let me know thx
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book lives up to the other books by this author. It is a fast read, and keeps your interest as it moves from one character to another each chapter.  The work gives much food for thought.  I am ready for his next book!
B0001GMIOE|1.0|500-1000 shots for an authentic Canon battery is not good which leads me to believe this is a fake. My Canon battery that came with my 20D would get me at least 1200-1500 shots at a wedding even after using it for 6 years and still have power left over. Unfortunately another photographer whom I was working an event at in Schaumburg stole mine while I had it charging and stuck his cheap knock off battery in my charger. Protect your authentic Canon batteries because they are worth every penny!
B008N1LL42|5.0|I am a real movie buff, and this movie had it all. It combined action, a great story line (one that actually made sense), superior graphics, and even a little humor, and yes...respect to our men in uniform to make it an all around favorite of mine. I have already watched it at least 10 times and I never tire of it. It keeps me engaged from start to end, and I will be buying it for Christmas gifts, as well. Nothing like a great movie in the midst of the many releases that are simply mediocre.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|I downloaded on Kindle Fire...it crashed so I uninstalled...downloaded again and now it wont open.  It worked just fine up until it crashed.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Absolutely gorgeous set. Perfectly filmed. Terrific performances all around. Far less of the awkward singing talking. All the musical pieces are performed with perfection. Only \\"Bathing Beauty\\" feels a little cheap...but it's meant to.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Fun to play for just about any age. It seems to be made well and works without issue on my Rezound.
B008B3MZNI|5.0|Simply put, the best BR concert video I own; video and audio of this 33 year old footage surpasses most video concerts being released nowadays.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|this book is GREAT , I recommend EVERYONE to read the whole trilogy. Opens eyes up to a very facinating sex lifestyle
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I enjoyed this book, although I'm not really sure why and I 'm a little uncomfortable about the fact that I liked it. On the one hand, it's well written and entertaining. The characters are mostly realistic although they have a tendency to be a little overdone. The situations they find themselves in are predictable, other than Abby's past, which came out of left field from me and was a nice twist.<br /><br />My biggest problem with the book is that it revolves around an extremely volatile, violent and co-dependent relationship. I knew that when I picked the book up to read but I was hoping that the ending would be different. I was disappointed in Abby's weakness and by her repeatedly putting herself in the same dangerous situations with Travis. I also didn't believe Travis' attempts at changing his behaviors at all. At the end of the book he was still exhibiting signs of possessive behavior and Abby is catering to it.<br /><br />I know that this is a fairly realistic portrait of many relationships, especially in the age group depicted. And like I said, I actually did enjoy the book. I'm just uncomfortable with the message it's sending to the (mostly) YA audience. I wouldn't want my teenage daughters to read this and think that the type of relationship depicted is ok and/or normal.
B008S0IJAM|5.0|This is my first exposure to Aimee Mann. I enjoy every song on the the album, some more than others. Labrador and Gumby are my two favorites.
1616960922|4.0|Whether you love Brandon Sanderson, as I do, or you've never read him (have you been living in a cave?) you must read this book. It is what I love most about Fantasy, about books, actually. A story about fantastical events in an imaginary world allow us to explore the big questions of our world. It's beautifully written, instantly engaging, inviting and memorable. Quite an accomplishment considering it takes place almost entirely inside a cell. I'm giving it 4 stars only it's too short and it's a cheap paperback. The cover art alone deserves a special edition hardcover on the best paper. If I ever get to meet Brandon Sanderson, this is the book I'm going to ask him to sign.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is the best game ever especially if you are in a long car ride going somewhere like a different state
B007TK77QE|3.0|I have long been a fan of JK Rowling and was delighted to see a new book from her. I couldn't wait to get started and the first few pages with her typical way with lush descriptions of characters didn't disappoint.<br />But I got further and further into the book and that is all it was. The plot, what plot? the book went nowhere. Yes I could visualise every character and every house because she is so very good at scene setting, but the overall book left me empty and disgruntled. In fact I only kept reading because it was JK Rowling.<br />While I can understand that in a series of books eg Harry Potter, one can take ones time and keep the reader coming back for more, I feel the author must try harder to grab the reader sooner and maintain interest with a decent story line.<br />I feel disloyal even criticising, but to be honest my rating of three stars was quite generous
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|....as much as I do this one! Call of Altantis (Premium) by Playrix, will be one of just 5 other game apps that will, without a doubt, remain installed on both, my Samsung Galaxy and, Kindle Fire. I also look forward to seeing how it'll appear & perform on Amazon's new 8.9\\" Kindle Fire HD; due to be released in early November of this year! I'd like to install Call of Atlantis (Premium) on the 8.9\\" & hoping the app will be compatible. (I will update this review at a later date.)<br /><br />If you like Bejeweled or any other similar Match 3 game, then you'll LOVE this even more! The graphics are bright, vivid & colorful. The design is simple but, certainly not boring! The music seems to fit the app well but it did get to me after playing for an hour. The sounds & music can be easily disabled by tapping the menu settings in the app.<br /><br />There are 6 Rounds you must play between each City. There are 7 cities in all: Rome, Greece, Troy, Phoenicia, Babylon, Egypt, Carthage with 6 more Rounds back to Rome from the city of Carthage, for a total of 48 Rounds in all. To mix things up a bit; before & at the end of each major Round, there are short mini games, as well.<br /><br />To top off this fun & never boring app....it has no IAP (in app purchasing) & no invasive permissions! This app is pretty close to.perfect as you can get in app! I'm impressed & highly recommend the download! Especially for the FAOTD<br /><br />And Yes. I.DO feel this app is worth every penny of it's asking price! You just dont see an app of this qualify & safety come along this often!<br />Grab this one!!
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Let me say first up, I am a total and utter Reacher fan - I just love the dude.  However,even though it's taken a while, Child is in danger of getting into what I call the 'Wilbur Smith syndrome'. Cranking them out too fast without real crafting, probably due to publisher pressure so everyone makes another squillion dollars.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it's good but there is a hint of the formulaic and rushed structure creeping in; way more than previous efforts.  It dragged a bit at the start with the now predictable lonely mid-west desert at night, 20oz coffees and the mandatory change of clothes from the gas station.  Almost like reading earlier ones.<br /><br />But it finally got going with an intriguing plot line and some good characters.  No love interest this time either and quite brutal too!!<br /><br />When it got into gear it was good, but still did not leave me with the ultimate \\"wow\\" factor of the earlier stuff.  Still worth reading, but I hope Child is not just getting into bed with the publishers and resorting to quantity over quality.
B000ID1J40|5.0|Fun and exciting movie, enjoyable for the whole family.  Lots if suspense and action, but still light-hearted and with good humor.  Our grade-school aged kids loved it (slight fast forwarding in on scene required) and came away excited about cryptography and espionage.
B008IZ5JVO|5.0|Dexter fan here. Season 6 Episode,\\"Smokey and the Bandit,\\"<br />was another great show. Never thought I'd ever watch a show<br />about a serial killer til Dexter. :)
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|had fun.  stayed entertained and puzzled. the free version did just enough to get me hooked, just had yo purchase so I could solve.
B004U8VQEC|5.0|I absolutely enjoyed watching this and recommend it to others.<br />If you're hooked on astronomy shows this nis a must see.
B00846REIS|5.0|very exciting. could not let go of the book. cant wait until the next one comes out in December. i definately recommend  this book!!!
B008IZ5JLO|5.0|Michael C Hall and fellow cast members make the characters believable.<br />I got cable so that i can watch it regular.
0385344333|2.0|This is not a great or even a good Lee Child book.  I seldom skim.  I did it with this book.  Too many scenes that don't advance the story.  Too much filler.  Too little character development.  I'm still confused about who got killed and his relationship to the other characters.  But, definitely not worth rereading to find out.<br /><br />There's a story here, but it should have been a short story not a 405 page one.  The editor did no one a favor by not pruning heavily.<br /><br />About my title, I think Child may not be happy the studio cast Tom Cruise as Reacher.  He mentions many times how big Reacher is, how long his arms are, and repeats and repeats that he looks like a gorilla.  Doesn't sound like Tom to me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really like this app I can use my own things to make anything I want and use my creativity!  love this app
B008XG1X18|3.0|love the app but it freezes often on my kindle fire :( other than the occasional freeze its great! I reccomend it!
B007TBZ63Y|1.0|I pre-ordered this book like about 2-3 months ago in the summer and I was really excited when it came out.  But when I got to chapter 25, the book crashes.  Sometimes the page freezes and something pops up telling me trio either force close it or wait for it to undressed.  And sometimes it just freezes and automatically kicks me  out.  I tried it on my sanding galaxy nexus, but it still did the same thing.  But other than that the book is really good so far.  I will give it five stars if they fix the book and give everyone a new copy or just give everyone refunds if you cant fix it.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|If this app is Free why is it asking for credit card details??... And its not allowing to load it on to my galaxy s2.... :-(
B008RTE08E|5.0|THE BOOTLEGS OF THIS MOVIE WERE HORRIBLE.  I USED TO BUY THEM AT BEATLES' CONVENTIONS HOPING TO FIND ONE WITH DECENT QUALITY.  IT WAS ON VHS FOR A WHILE IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN BUT IT WAS STILL POOR QUALITY.  THE MUSIC SPEAKS FOR ITSELF AND ALTHOUGH THE MOVIE IS UNORGANIZED AND SPORADIC...IT'S STILL THE BEATLES!  IT YIELDS SOME GROUNDBREAKING VIDEOS WITH \\"I AM THE WALRUS\\" BEING THE MOST NOTEWORTHY MOMENT OF THE FILM.  YOU EITHER LOVE THEM OR HATE THEM.  THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR EVERYBODY...BUT IF YOU UNDERSTAND THEIR UNIQUE SENSE OF SATIRE YOU'LL LAUGH QUITE A BIT AT SOME OF THE SCENES AS THEY ARE INSANE!
B008TMA1LY|4.0|Very cute and Quite fun. It gets hard if you don't buy (hire) the extra staff. From comments i've seen don't let the kids play unsupervised or you'll wind up paying to hire extra staff with real money.
B008SVFX96|5.0|Absolutely loved \\"World\\".  Bruce Foster -- Thank you so much for co-writing this amazing song.  We need more songs like this.
B0056CUZRA|5.0|As with all Ken Folletts' books this is well researched, well crafted and easy to read - Ace as always
B009G3SLJY|3.0|This album is not as good as these reviewers make it out to seem.<br />I'll admit, it's not a bad album by any means, but after Life Starts Now I was hoping TDG were going in a different and evolved direction with their music, but what they've come up with here is completely uninspired and generic mainstream rock.  If that's what you're looking for then you'll like it, but if you were hoping for something a bit beyond what they've done in the past then this is not it.  The instrumentation is good and Transit of Venus comes with the best drum recordings of any of the band's catalog, however, the lyrics are so generic they can't be ignored.  \\"Misery Loves My Company\\"? \\"Happiness - Straight from the bottle\\"?  \\"You're the unbreakable heart\\"? Come on.<br /><br />I hold this band to a higher standard than many because I know they can do better.  This sounds like a never-released Hinder album.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|This movie is el stinko, el rotteno, made me want to pukeo. The worst ever film in years;: should be the subject of a product  recall.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great free game. not recommend playing at work. you wont get anything done. hard to put down. fun for all ages too.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|I received it very quickly.  The dvds were all in great shape.  I love this show I think it is hilarious.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I love the sound of Lana Del Rey's music. This was my favorite album of the last year, and I'm eagerly awaiting her new CD. The tone of Del Rey's music is usually low, moody, melodic, and haunting and her voice is like a jazzy, sultry lounge singer. Then at times, she sings in a higher girly pop-sounding voice that contrasts those darker tones. It's unique and it's addictive.<br /><br />Listen to the music samples here on Amazon - if you like the samples, you'll probably LOVE this album because while some of the songs were immediately addictive to me (Video Games, Blue Jeans, Radio), some of the songs got even better upon repeat listens (This Is What Makes Us Girls, Summertime Sadness).
B008XG1X18|4.0|this app is awesome. the only glitches I have found is that it force closes on my kindle fire. other than that I love it.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Mumford created a superb album that is both nostalgic and forward looking.  The depth of lyrics and energizing melodies make this a perfect Autumn album.  Below My Feet was a surprise hit for me.  On my running playlist now.  :)
B009AJDDQU|5.0|MOST COOL FLICK... SOME QUESTIONS AT THE END. BUT IF YOU RESEARCH A LITTLE AND WATCH THE ALTERNATE ENDINGS,,, IT ALL MAKES SENSE.... NEXT UP P-2!! IF THEY DO THAT ONE RIGHT -- WHOA!!
B008NB0SQO|1.0|Disney have butchered this release by only including the cut version of the film. It is approximately 4 minutes shorter than the full version - the most crucial song to the plot has been cut out. I for one will not be buying, and if anyone at Disney is reading this, then I implore you to tidy up this mess that has been going on for 10 years now on a future release.
0240815807|5.0|This book is fantastic! First read through I had trouble grasping some of the vast information especially with setting up your monitors and positioning them to maximize the sweet spot -- but after doing some of my own research - filling in the gaps in my vocabulary I'm getting it! I'm half way through my 2nd read and I'm understanding mixing like I never though I would. It's exciting to say the least. I really have to give props to Mike Senior for compiling all this complex material into an easy to read and compeling book. This is one music production book that won't sit on my bookshelf -- it'll be near my studio workspace for years to come.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Really like this game.  It keeps me entertained while I have speech tone at work.  I don't buy coins just let rebuild
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love it it is a great novel .I Like it better than the movie but a little different than the movie<br /><br />TEAM PEETA
B007I1QUYE|2.0|Felt like a cheap knockoff.  Definitely works well for people that just want the movies but no money or effort was spent on the container.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|love it! I love the jewel game. puzzle part is fun too. cant wait to get further in the game
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Wonderful take on a classic.  Most of the acting was great, the queen was a little over done.  Enjoyed the graphics and special fx!  TThe whole movie was an epic build up only to fizzle and die out in the weak ending.  But, worth the watch.
0307387178|5.0|The story of Chris McCandless and his fatal trip into wild Alaska is simple and straightforward. In April of 1992, having abandoned his car and earlier life, the 24-year-old McCandless hitchhiked into Alaska's Denali state park, where he waded through a shallow river into the wilderness. By August his body was found in an abandoned city bus that had been set up years before as shelter for hunters. He was dead of starvation.<br /><br />So we have a familiar story line: a greenhorn camper takes on Mother Nature and dies, a victim of his own lack of judgment. True enough, but there's more here. Chris McCandless was a competent outdoorsman and hunter; He had done this kind of thing before and survived just fine. We readers, looking at his story, might conclude that he was a victim of \\"bad luck\\"--and he was in a way--but he himself helped create this \\"luck\\" when he decided to close the door on civilization so that he could make a completely fresh start, like a new Adam in a sinless wilderness. The door that closed behind him when he hiked over that river in 1992 turned on two hinges: a book that he brought with him, and a map that he didn't bring.<br /><br />Hinge One: the Book. McCandless brought only a bag of rice for food, so he intended to live off the land. He had a .22 rifle, good enough for small game such as squirrels. And he brought along a plant guidebook to help him identify what he could eat and what he shouldn't. As the author points out, the diet McCandless provided for himself was dangerously short on calories since he couldn't bring down larger meat sources such as deer. Relying on the guidebook, he dined on plant life, especially the wild local potatoes. But the book didn't make clear something about those potatoes: the seeds are poisonous though the rest of the root is not. Chronically hungry, he ate both. Though not strong enough to kill him outright, the seeds weakened him enough that his deficient diet eventually starved him to death.<br /><br />Hinge Two: the Map. The main purpose in this adventure was to prove himself, so McCandless decided to create the experience of an explorer venturing into \\"terra incognita,\\" an unknown world. No such place existed in late 20th-Century America--every wild area had long since been explored--so the next best thing was some remote place in the remotest state in America. With this in mind, he chose Alaska, found a suitable wilderness north of Denali, and after that looked at no maps. He would live by his wits, using the abandoned bus as a headquarters. He did, and for a while he made do. By summer he'd proven what he needed to prove, so he packed up and hiked out.<br /><br />When he reached the river, however, everything had changed. The stream that he had waded in April was now a powerful, glacier-fed torrent, wide and impassible. Had he waded even a little ways into this current, he would have been swept into a rocky canyon and drowned. Up and down the river it was the same: fast-moving water and high canyon walls. He was trapped. So he turned around and returned to the shelter, dug up some potatoes to help wait out the flood season, and began to die.<br /><br />It is here that this all becomes tragedy. A 1990s topographical map of this part of Alaska shows a cable bridge just a mile or so upstream from where McCandless abandoned his attempt to ford the river. Surveyors had built the bridge, a simple setup consisting of a steel cable supporting a metal seat with a pulley-wheel on top. A passenger sits in the seat and pulls himself hand-over-hand across the gorge. The seat unit was parked on his side of the river, but McCandless didn't know it was there. Mapless, he knew only one way out, and he had tried that. Had he studied a detailed map ahead of time, and therefore known about the bridge just upriver, he'd be alive today, probably telling fellow adventurers the story of his 1992 \\"miraculous\\" escape.<br /><br />A Catholic reader will do well to pay attention to this story. Our culture does not take kindly to the truths that religion provides, based on 4000 years of careful consideration. To be an adult today, one is told make his own choices and live by his wits in a new kind of \\"terra incognita.\\" Today we are on our own in a cultural wilderness, and we are starving.<br /><br />The knowledge that faith supplies is also like a door with two hinges: the book of Scripture and the map of Church tradition. The world is a dangerous place, as Into the Wild powerfully shows. We do well to read the book, with appropriate guidance from scholars, and pay attention to the map, because it shows a bridge we also can take. That bridge is the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Cross it and be saved.
0312641893|5.0|There are longer, well written highly detailed reviews here already but this book deserves even more praise.  My middle school daughter got this book the day it came into her school library and devoured it.  She was so excited about it I read it too.  It is  a retelling of Cinderella but set in the future and Cinderella is a cyborg.  All the traditional Cinderella characters appear with inventive, fresh twists befitting good sci fi.  It was a wonderful read and we have preordered the next one in the series.  Four thumbs way up!
B008220AVW|5.0|Great movie and fun for the whole family. There are so many ups and downs. It shows so much of her life and I definitely recommend it! Katy is such an inspiration!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is the greatest note app ever.<br />The only issue that I have is not all file types are supported.<br />It installs great, Ive used it on an iPad, Kindle Android and Windows and everthing syncs perfectly.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I've read a lot of books this year. Some have been multiple narrators, most have not. I'm a big fan of the multiple perspective genre that seems to be becoming more popular these days, and absolutely loved this book. As for everyone saying that the characters did not hold their attention, I can not disagree more. The characters were so realistic and detailed, and the writing was fantastic. The characters were exaggerated for entertainment, rather, they were very much like you and I, but perhaps some a bit more gritty. It was a wonderful story that I would definitely read again.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is one of the Best true stories I have read in a very long time! When I got to the final chapters, it took me several tries to finish as it was so powerfully moving. An extremely motivating and uplifting story.
B008I34YYY|2.0|Thought this movie would be great! It wasn't , it was really horrible. The movie was not serious but more of a comdey The movie would have done so much better if wasn't a comdey!!
0545265355|3.0|Note: The following might contain a few spoilers.<br /><br />I won't go into any detail about the story since there is more than enough reviews that elaborate on it. I will, however, speak to the writing in all three books. The use of first person immediate is very difficult to pull-off correctly. Although Ms. Collins does this exceptionally well in the first book, despite a few bobbles, but this POV tends to fall flat in the other two books. Katniss, as we see early on, is an unreliable narrator. In the first book, this plays very well. However, as the series progresses, Katniss never seems to pick the correct answer to her introspections even though the answer is evident to the reader. While this increases the tension in the first book, this reliable unreliability becomes an annoyance in the other two.<br /><br />In The Hunger Games, Ms. Collins juxtaposes Katniss' situation in District 12 against the Capital very well. Katniss appears strong, she is willing to give her life for others, yet she knows what is happening to her should not be allowed. Katniss questions herself and her place in the \\"Games,\\" though she still continues to see things to the end. She exudes a strong innocence and a forced maturity that comes from having to care for her family. This, too, comes across very well, and Ms. Collins did a suburb job with Katniss in this respect. The writing more than compensated for the minor flaws in the first book. Ms. Collins kept the tension going on almost every page, and even though the readers knew that Katniss was going to win the \\"Games,\\" how she would win, and at what cost, was always a recurring subtext.<br /><br />In Catching Fire, Ms. Collins continues the story logically, but it doesn't flow as smoothly as it does in the first book. The pacing is slightly off, the first plot point seems to come too early, and the characters are superficial at best. Several scenes appeared to be rushed, and while Katniss questions herself as she did in the first book, here it seems obligatory, as though the reader wouldn't pick up the subtleties in the text and has to be force-fed the questions for the sake of tension. Aside from a small typo, there are a few good moments when Ms. Collins hits the mark, but they are far and few between.<br /><br />Mockingjay is by far the worst of the three books, which is a shame since it is the last book in the series. Instead of ending with a bang, Ms. Collins decided to end with a whimper. Here, the use of first person doesn't just fall flat, it deflates. Our old friend Katniss, doesn't appear to be in this book in any sense. Peeta has been reduced to a babbling tool of the Capital, and Gayle quickly becomes a nonsensical adjunct to the rebels. Again, Katniss is plagued with internal questions that steer her in the wrong direction. In the first book, her internalizations forced the reader to feel for her. The pathos that Ms. Collins initially imbued Katniss with is non-existent in the last book, and there is too much information behind the scenes that Katniss is not privy to. This means that Katniss has to either get information from overhearing other conversations, having it told to her directly, or obtaining it secretly, and it doesn't mesh well with the theme of the story. Aside from that, Katniss spends most of her time hiding, or unconscious to the point where you want to reach into the book and slap her. If this is what Ms. Collins was going for, she succeeded.<br /><br />It's usually easy to tell when a writer loves the scenes he or she is writing, and it is very clear that the first book took longer to write than the others. I can picture Ms. Collins' publisher telling her that they will agree to buy the book with the contractual agreement of two more books. Given the timeline, I suspect that Ms. Collins rushed to finish the last book.<br /><br />After reading some of the other reviews, good and bad, I would have to say that I don't agree with all the complaints, nor do I agree with all the accolades bestowed upon the series. Readers have to remember that these books, despite the subject matter, is geared toward a younger crowd. Some of the comments about how our current form of government could have disintegrated into an abysmal state is inconsequential to the story. As an adult, I would be fascinated in how this dystopia came about, but younger readers would be uninterested. A lot of the rave reviews spoke about the message that war is hell, you never come out of a war that same way you go in, blah, blah, blah. While I am in no way attempting to diminish the affect wars have, and I am acquainted with PTSD, to assign a real ending with a fictional story though is akin to having Lewis Carroll commit Alice to an insane asylum after coming back through the looking glass. This is a work of fiction. It is a F A N T A S Y. Thus, the ending could have been anything that Ms. Collins wished. Katniss could have become president and along with Peeta live happily ever after. Katniss could have reverted to the likes of President Snow, or she could have just given up and walked back home. Ms. Collins chose the `war is hell' route portraying Katniss as a shadow of her former self. I don't need a lesson when reading this type of fiction. However, looking at it from the point of view of a young reader, I can see where this might make an impression. Older readers need to understand that The Hunger Game series is geared toward YA readers and therefore won't contain the sophistication of Asimov or Orson Scott Card. Ms. Collins writes for the YA reader and manages to do it quite well most of the time. I can only pray that Ms. Collins portrays Katniss in the final movie as a content adult with a loving family, and future filled with love and purpose. Something I think Katniss was wishing for ever since the first book.<br /><br />I give the first book 4 stars, the second 3 stars, and the third 2 stars. Overall, 3 stars for the series.
B007SGM084|5.0|Downloaded the sample because I wasn't sure I wanted to spend $30 on a  trilogy, even if everyone was talking about it--and I'm excited to say as soon as I got to the end of the last chapter of the sampler, I immediately had to make the purchase. I had to find out what happened to Ana and I couldn't stop reading, and I haven't regretted the $$ once.<br /><br />I'm on my 3rd read through of this book and I'm still enjoying the love story between Christian and Ana.  I know, I know, everyone is all caught up on the kinky sex; but if you look beyond that--it's a wonderful love story of an insecure megalo-billionaire and an innocent woman who loves him for himself, despite the 50 shades of f***-ed-upedness! (is that even a word)? and all his money!<br /><br />The first book is definitely the hook--you are shocked and awed by the idea that these types of relationships actually occur in our world between consenting adults, but for me, the hook was the connection with Ana and how her innocence was being awakened by someone taking her far out of the depths of any conventional love she'd ever imagined...and guiding her and loving her and showing her wonder and making her dreams come true as she was healing his broken body, heart and spirit.<br /><br />And, can I just add that the email plays, back and forth, are one of the most enjoyable parts of the book...they made me smile constantly and I always felt like a voyeur as I was reading them.<br /><br />Ms. James gave me characters that I could identify with. The young abused child who was never loved and never felt good enough for love as he got older, and the innocent young girl who also felt too awkward or shy for love. When they met sparks flew and love grew.<br /><br />Definitely would recommend this book to anyone looking for a great book to curl up and read! :)
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good read.Kept me very interested all the time, had a hard time putting the book down.  The ending was crazy, and unexpected. Would recommend this book.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This excellent book kept me on the edge of my seat for the entire read. This is one book you don't want to put down! All coming together for a mind-blowing ending!Parental devotion and the court process for finding the truth gives you more understanding of how innocent or guilty can become a facinating dilemma! Setting out to find the truth is indeed facinating! I highly recommend you read this book!!!! I purchased this book from Amazon and am very satisfied to have their link!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a tile like game similar to treasures of Montezuma and 7 wonders, call of Atlantis  keeps it interesting with a storyline and changing puzzles,  it gets addictive and fun.
B009FKZ9AM|5.0|When I heard their debut when it come out, I wasn't thrilled about it.  While it was good, it just did not keep my attention to well.  So as you can imagine, I didn't have the highest expectations concerning this one, but it was quite the pleasant suprise.  I love the slowed down pace, the slightly darker/heavier feel/mood, and the old-school garage rock-ish lead guitar.  In fact, I like it even better than The Killers' new record (a record which I do very much enjoy as well).  So, if you don't mind the fact that this one is less like The Hives and more like Interpol, I have no doubt you'd love Come Of Age.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Would of been better if you were able to play different games as you finished puzzles.  Some prizes hardly ever drop.  ex:12 glasses but only one red car has dropped
1449410243|5.0|My copy of this impressive book came the other day. A weighty tome with beautiful colors and nice thick paper, I set it on the table for the afternoon until I could finish work. While eating some dinner and reading about the Bob Cats, I heard a strange noise. I ignored it at first, until it got louder and louder. I turned around and my cat was busy horking up what appeared to be at least 3 gallons of regurgitated cat food on my carpet. I can only assume this was a warning as she must have read the book while I was at work. I'll be arming myself from now on. I hope to survive this upcoming war - please pray for me.

And i am glad there is more and more smart entertainment on American tv

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Sooo interesting. I couldn't wait to get from one thing to the next to see what was next. The games and puzzles along the way were not just put in, they had something to do with the whole game. Nicely done.
B002RI9UBS|4.0|This book has some fantastic prose and eloquent language that seems to just flow like a cascade. I must say that I fell in love with its prose. Now, coming to the story, its fantastically unbelievable fantasy. I would not say that its a must read for every person. But I would say that it would be an enjoyable read and you would find that the pages turn really fast even though the majority of the book is about life on a boat! If you've seen the move 127 hours, you would know what I mean. It was a damn interesting movie for something thats been shot in a single spot for its majority play time. Same goes for this book.

B008IYR2BA|1.0|I just got through the DVD set for season 6 and I realized that Showtime spoiled the end for season 6 in ads for season 7.<br /><br />^^That is already too much info.<br /><br />If you watch the unskippable preview at the start of each disk you will also see the ending spoiled. I never paid attention to those things, so I was ok in that sense, but the billboards and online ads did spoil it for me. I even watched with hope that the ending would be different but it wasnt.<br /><br />Find another method for watching this if you are a Dexter fan and havent seen it. I WAS a fan for over 6 years, needless to say Showtime isn't getting another cent from me for pulling this stunt.<br /><br />1 star because 0 isn't an option.

B007JOM0GC|5.0|Great songs and great album. There is a good balance of fun pop music, and some emotional and even melancholy songs. Good workout soundtrack.
B00910Y1OQ|2.0|It's a Bejewelled game that goes through many unchallenging levels. I don't find it fun in the slightest. The graphics are pretty. And the story line is nice. But all you do is play super short games to get objects that will allow you to get the crystals that will restore the power back to Atlantis. I was excited to download only to find after playing 20 minutes that it wasn't going to get any better. Mpre and more of the same. Sure they would make minor attepmts to make it more difficult. But you can bypass the levels very easily if you collect a bunch of four object matches to charge your amulet. (Which by the way they constantly show the amulet after every level. It gets old pretty quick.)  It would have been nice if there were other types of puzzles involved. I'm glad this was free cause I'd have been real pissed to pay $5.00 for a boring game. Bejewelled is more fun. This is a colossal ware of time.
1469220482|1.0|Read the book and loved it.  I purchased the audio book for a long trip.  The reader is the worst!! Her Gideon is ridiculous and I found myself wanting to stop it and not listen.  I enjoyed both books in this series.  I am hoping the next reader will do the author justice.
1423124111|5.0|This is a coffee table book that collects the posters for various attractions at the Magic Kingdom parks around the world over the years.  And it's everything this fan has been wanting.<br /><br />The book is broken down into various chapters by lands.  After a brief one page introduction, the rest of the pages are filled with the posters for the attractions and restaurants in that area of the park.  That can create some cross over for things like the Haunted Mansion or Pirates of the Caribbean that appear in multiple places in the various parks.  But that's what the index in the back is for.  They include posters for old attractions that aren't in the park any more.  While posters are really only something for the Magic Kingdom, they do have chapters devoted to Tokyo Disney Sea and California Adventure as well.<br /><br />But the majority of the book is filled with the posters reproduced in full color.  We get posters from various times and locations side by side, so it's easy to see how they compare.<br /><br />And the book is very up to date.  The chapter on California Adventure includes the posters for the attractions in the just opened Carsland.<br /><br />Anyone who loves this art work will love this book.  By all means, check it out.
B006LQQ1GE|2.0|I took a chance buying this cd and did not like it.  I read the reviews and thought it would possibly be good but was not.  I only like 2 songs on the cd and had trouble listening to its entirety.  Definitely not a good choice for me.  I would not recommend it to anyone.
B007BLDFWG|3.0|I really enjoy stories of people who have become \\"lost\\" in their lives but this story left me feeling empty. It would have been a much better story if we had gotten more of the girl's back-story...what made her go searching? what caused the emptiness in her life that made her susceptible to a self-made guru? what was she thinking??? This was just a sad story that went no where. In the end I got frustrated and just didn't care anymore.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|This is one of the rockinest, most fun, mind blowing DVDs you're ever going to see. Just magic. And for a lousy $17 bucks?  You can't go wrong. Even if you hate the blues, you're going to love this.

0385344333|3.0|Pre-ordered this book because have liked all the other Reacher stories.  This story was not as good as previous books.  Would like to give him 5 stars or even 4 stars, but just not that good.  I did get tired of all the action happening in a automobile.  Will still buy Lee Child's books, but hope this was just a fluke.
0061353248|5.0|Predictably Irrational is filled from beginning to end with useful bits of information. Daniel Ariely is remarkable in his ability to define simple testing procedures to validate his theories. I've read numerous books by people who had demonstrated something interesting by the use of a study, and often they end up spending page upon page on the testing protocol because there are so many complexities. Ariely cuts through all that, presenting study after study in just a paragraph or so each, and in each case he clearly lays out what his theory is and how he intends to prove or disprove it. Further, the conclusions are often remarkable and interesting.<br /><br />In short, this is an amazing book and I learned something new and interesting in every single chapter.
B0098VXCR0|3.0|It's a run of the mill movie for this genre.  Needed more character development in my humble opinion.  But, still a fun movie if you like fantasy and swords action.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Just spent about 10 hours enjoying this release and its special features today.  I can't rave enough about this edition.  The movie itself is awesome--much more so than i had dared hope.  I am a big Alien fan, and I'd heard some so-so things about this movie.  For me, this was exactly what the franchise needed...a sideways retool, not precisely a reboot, because the mythology is just being more carefully fleshed out.  Alien was a small focus, insular, claustrophobic horror film--perfect in itself, but it left much shrouded in mystery (to good effect.  I appreciated the laser like focus of that film)  This film is grand and broad, with a wider viewpoint than Alien, but it clarifies so many things.... A wonder and a treat.  The special features are exhaustive, and offer more detail than any other than the most absurdly die hard fans could want, from special effects, to casting, to sets, to the fAntastic score.  I picked this up for 25 from Amazon, and it is a great bargain.  It is worth it at twice the price; now I just can't wait for the sequel!
0061765236|4.0|My overall opinion: I enjoyed this book for what it is: a dramatic young adult novel. However, as with most Jodi Picoult novels, the characters are usually far too melodramatic for the circumstances. When I was younger, I read a few Jodi Picoult novels, including Nineteen Minutes and The Tenth Circle, and I quite enjoyed them. Then again, I was about 16, 17 years old, the appropriate age range that I would assume Picoult had in mind when writing most of her novels. Four to five years down the road, I decided to read The Pact, one of her novels that I'd wanted to read for quite some time but always found something else to read instead. So I finally bought The Pact. I actually read all of it in five days. If there is one thing Picoult can do, it's write a novel that will keep you turning the pages.<br /><br />The good: Jodi Picoult is a FANTASTIC writer. There isn't a single word in any of her novels that doesn't serve a purpose. Her diction is concise and well-developed, and every element of the plot is relevant. She certainly doesn't waste time with anything, and I love stories that just get straight to the point. If there is a writer who can write, it's Jodi Picoult.<br /><br />I love how fleshed out each and every character in this book is. Even those who I strongly dislike, I found that I could easily distinguish each from the next. I really liked Chris, and I felt very sorry for him and the situation he was in. He was probably my favorite character. I also loved to hate Emily and her mother, Melanie, because they were just so selfish and vindictive, and boy did that ring clear throughout the book!<br /><br />What I love most about Picoult's novels, as I mentioned above, is how compelling of a read they are. Her books are those that you can sit down and read non-stop because the story is so enjoyable. Any book that keeps me turning pages and staying up late is definitely a winner in my opinion.<br /><br />The bad: There is a certain amount of predictability thatcomes with reading one of Picoult's novels, and in the three novels I've read, it all goes the same. You have a \\"whodunnit?\\" tale where usually one person dies (and that is the one person who can answer all the questions regarding the alleged crime); you have a usually angsty, whiny teenager as the main character who always wants to commit some kind of self-flagellant act to show the world just how serious s/he is; and you have a big twist at the end that makes whatever theory you came up with in your mind fall to pieces as you realize, \\"Ooohhhhh, that makes sense.\\" All three of these elements occurred, once again, in The Pact.<br /><br />I don't mind the \\"whodunnit?\\" element of her novels. I like wondering what exactly happened in the story, and that's what makes it so hard to put her novels down. I also like the big twist that comes at the end because it's what makes the story very, very good and unpredictable (for predictability's sake). But, I CANNOT STAND whiny characters. I loathe them. And she crafts them to a T. And it's usually the same character, too: a pretty, popular girl who has some kind of secret that she can't tell anyone and therefore thinks that gives her the okay to be a rude snob to everyone around her. Oh, and she usually has self-destructive tendencies, such as cutting herself with a knife. And I'm being serious about this, too: in The Tenth Circle, the main character cuts herself throughout the majority of the novel, and in The Pact, well...the girl commits suicide. So enough said.<br /><br />So even though Emily Gold died and Chris Harte lived, in the flashbacks I could not stand that girl. I actually think I hated her. She was rude, selfish, and annoying. I understand that what she was going through actually made sense for her to be upset about (she was molested as a kid in a McDonald's; she was eleven weeks pregnant at the time of her suicide; and she had parents that imposed a passive element of perfectionism on her), but my God, girl, give it a rest! People go through worse stuff than that on a daily basis, and they manage to get on with life! My point here is this: her reasons for wanting to commit suicide were so underdeveloped that I had a hard time believing in the severity of her issues, and therefore had a hard time seeing any reason behind her desire to end her life. This just made me hate her even more. Also, the fact that she was ONLY concerned with her feelings and her well-being, and not with anyone else around her (i.e. her family, her unborn child, or Chris himself), made her seem that much more selfish and annoying. Because of her, Chris ended up in jail, wrongly accused. Way to go, Emily.<br /><br />Why I gave it the rating I did: I thoroughly enjoyed the book, despite how much some of the characters annoyed me. But all in all, there wasn't much - if anything - that I could find that was wrong with it. Judging this story as a piece of literature, it was perfectly wrapped and cleanly polished. Even in spite of the characters like Emily and Melanie, they weren't enough to make me hate or even dislike the book. However, I could not bring myself to rate this with 5 stars, simply because it wasn't something that made me say, \\"OHMYGOSH! MUST! HAVE! MORE!\\"<br /><br />Who would enjoy this book:<br />1. Fans of Jodi Picoult's novels.<br />2. Teenagers, especially those who appreciate real, well-developed romances with real-life elements.<br />3. People who appreciate a well-written piece of literature.<br /><br />You can read the full review of this book and other reviews on my blog at christinamlegler . blogspot . com (no spaces).
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Great series by HBO, it is not made for children just adults. I can't wait for season 2 and 3.
0786838655|5.0|My overall opinion: I totally loved this book. It was such a fun, easy read, and I could not put it down. I had very, very few problems with it, and I loved the main characters so much. I haven't loved a book this much since I read the Harry Potter series, so if that doesn't make my point, I don't know what does. Needless to say, I've already bought the five-book paperback set through Amazon so that I don't have to drop seven to eight dollars a book, and so that I have the entire series available at will for my reading pleasure. Yes, I loved it that much!<br /><br />The good: What caught my attention first and guaranteed me to keep reading was the diction of the narrative. Now, I'm not a big fan of first-person-narrative - it is usually not done well (I hated the narrative of  The Hunger Games) or is bland and similar to every other FPN. Here, Percy's voice comes alive, and I was immediately able to shape my impression of him as the \\"punk kid with a good heart.\\" Nothing pleases me more than a well-written narrative with colorful diction. I absolutely loved the descriptions Riordan used, especially when talking about the people that Percy disliked, i.e. Smelly Gabe: \\"The guy reeked like moldy garlic pizza wrapped in gym shorts,\\" (p. 30) and \\"He looked like a tuskless walrus in thrift-store clothes\\" (p. 31). I literally laughed out loud when I read these quips, and I really tried to imagine these scents and visuals. They were just so humorous.<br /><br />There were just so many quips like these that made me laugh, and things that just fit so well. There were also lines that weren't meant to be funny but were simply captivating, such as when Posedion said, \\"The sea does not like to be restrained\\" (p. 345). I thought that this line, in particular, was quite beautiful. I was impressed by the way Riordan could make the majority of the novel be so humorous, but still find appropriate placements for brief serious moments.<br /><br />My favorite character was Percy himself.It is always a relief when my favorite character is the main character. This might seem like an obvious idea, but there are some books where I can't stand the main character, and you have to think...if I'm going to be spending 300 pages with this guy, I need to at least tolerate him. I instantly fell in love with Percy, no question about it. He is exactly the way I want my future kid to be: fun, humorous, and tough-but-kind. I also loved both Annabeth and Grover - I loved the way they looked after Percy, and were genuinely caring towards him. Good friends, indeed. I even loved the minor characters like Chiron and Luke. Every character was so well-shaped.<br /><br />The bad: The biggest - and perhaps, only - issue that I had with this book was with the kids' rather ignorant and, well, stupid mistakes with repeatedly falling into the same trap. Time after time, they'd find themselves in a seemingly wonderful, too-good-to-be-true moment, and once that moment has passed, they would find themselves face-to-face with another enemy. After two or three times of this happening, I became mildly annoyed.<br /><br />Now I know they are only twelve years old, but here is my argument: Annabeth, Grover, and Percy are all completely aware of how important Percy's quest is, and how nearly every subordinate of Percy's enemy gods are on a manhunt to find and stop him. Knowing this, you think they'd be more sensible about stopping to sight-see, or walking into a random old woman's house and accepting her offer for dinner, or accepting a limitless debit card at a casino in Las Vegas. Weren't we raised as children not to walk into strangers' homes, or to accept mysterious gifts without knowing who or where they came from? You would think these kids would have been better on their guard, especially given Percy's circumstances. I suppose kids will be kids and will throw the whole \\"thinking straight\\" thing out the window sometimes, but come on, Percy! The fate of the otherworlds depends onyou! Be smart!<br /><br />Why I gave it the rating I did (it was actually 4.5 stars): I really, really wanted to give this book 5 stars, but I couldn't because of my aforementioned problem. Had it not been for that simple flaw, a 5-star rating would have been a certainty. Nonetheless, the plot was smooth, exciting, and just plain fun; the characters are quite lovable and have vivid, definitive personalities; and the diction is humorous and wonderful. This book was very short of perfect.<br /><br />Who would enjoy this book:<br />1. People who enjoy an easy read<br />2. People who love fun, colorful adventures<br />3. Fans of the Harry Potter series<br /><br />You can read my full review of this book and other reviews on my blog at christinamlegler . blogspot . com (no spaces).
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this read.  I fell in love with all the characters and I couldn't wait to see were Travis and Abby's relationship was going to go.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|It tons of fun but depending on the background and certain vehicles that you use on each run will make the game accelerate more than I'm guessing is intended. I'm assuming it probably hardware acceleration that is causing this since I'm using tegra 2 on my g2x. Once the acceleration is fixed it's 5 stars.
B004GYY714|5.0|I LOVE this app!I listen to alot of types of music so this pretty much covers it all for me.Highly recommend!
B001227N6E|5.0|Obviously everyone loves Dookie and American Idiot, but I think this album is just as musically groundbreaking for Green Day. It is sort of musically inbetween Dookie and American Idiot. There isn't a single song that sucks and most of the songs are really good and fun to listen to. My favorite songs are Warning, Blood Sex and Booze, Church on Sunday, Deadbeat Holiday, and Minority. I also love how 60s it sounds (one song even has a harmonica).
B005LAII0I|2.0|I was disappointed I suppose. Julia was not what I expected, however, I bought this move to watch with my grandchildren. I'm so happy she does good movies I can watch with them. There are so few anymore. I would buy this movie again of course....I wonder if she would make \\"Beauty and the Beast\\"? I do love her movies..she makes movies we can all watch togeter as a family....unlike most of her peers.
B009B50QOU|4.0|Uno isn't Green Day's best album overall, but that doesn't mean it sucks. It still has plenty of great songs, and only 1 or 2 that I didn't like. For Green Day fans, obviously this isn't another American Idiot, but it takes the music writing abilities of 21st Century Breakdown and applies it to the musical style of Dookie, making it an entirely new type of sound. Although, I do have to admit, some of the songs sound a little like the Ramones and Social Distortion, but Billie Joe Armstrong's voice makes it unique. Beatles style, with AC/DC energy.<br /><br />My favorite songs are Nuclear Family, Stay the Night, Let Yourself Go, Kill the DJ, and Oh Love. Notice how most of these are singles, that's because they other songs are slower (and therefore less interesting to me). They are still good though. I wouldn't say this album has a Wake Me Up When September Ends or a 21 Guns, but remember, this is just the first of 3 albums. I am sure the second or third one will have a brilliant power ballad. This album is the rise before the fall and resolution.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I love this app its like bejewlwed with amazing music and addictive game as well has a good lock down on buyinng things love it
B00459GJUM|5.0|love this series  only drawback to me, Rush  always some shithead who is smarter than everyone else so he is always antagonistic and secretive  \\"no understands this so they do not need to know\\"  good ideas  good story line  get rid of Rush and his attitude
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|It's been a while since there has been a quality FAOTD. This is a good redemption. It will keep you busy when you have time to kill.  Typical match three game play, but it's done with flair.
B003U55J9Y|5.0|ive never seen a ending that had such an impact on me when i saw the dog lay down next to jack and be with him while he died...the whole time at the end i was wondering about the dog and when he came out to b with jack it just made everything make more sense the whole time jack thought he was supposed to die alone to save the island thanks to Vincent he didn't have to be alone i think his statement live together die alone didn't make a lot of sense seeing as how living together didn't work a lot of the times but no one died alone everyone always had someone with them that cared about them or loved them or just plain was with them..the whole time i thought jack was gana die alone but the dog saved him from that and i thought that was the best part of the last episode
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love reading this book on my kindle, it so nice to be able to select tex size for easy reading. This book is the best one out of all three even thought they are all great books I couldn't put my kindle down til I was finish it a must read.
B0097VS7ZS|1.0|this game is a virus and a waste of money. I could of bought 149 penny candies with that money. But noooooooo I just had to Color. I am a strong believer that the heart will go on. I cant dwell on what could have been. Don't buy this game. think of the candies.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love the Facebook app on my kindle so easy to use and navigate. The hd picture is amazing, I use my kindle more than my laptop so conscientious.
B000IKNZMM|4.0|exciting the more so because it actually happened. good acting and beautifully photographed. a lesson to be learned is that america should not let other countries be more advanced than us in any military field.
1609611543|3.0|I was very taken by the idea that wheat was the big evil instead of saturated fat.  The first part of the book is a very interesting description of this theory.  But when it comes down to the diet described, including many recipes, this really is just is a low carb diet book, a slightly modified Atkins diet.  He basically tells you to not eat any grains, not just wheat, but also rye, barley and corn.  The only real exception seems to be ground flax seed.  A little fruit is okay.  I had followed the Atkins diet for a few months in the 1990s after listening to Dr. Atkins' radio show.  It was extremely difficult to follow, and so is this diet. I feel comfortable saying that only the extremely motivated top 1% could follow this diet.  That's how I interpreted this book.  Obviously, the many 5 star rating disagree with me, perhaps they read a different book?
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Movie was so much better than what I expected.. When It came to Captain America, that movie was so boring. This movie is nothing like that. Exciting,action filled,funny,and dramatic.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|Love the packaging and it is a must buy collector's item. I had it for a few years now and everything is still in great shape!. Happy with puchase.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|thank you! My cable arrived very timely and I used it as soon as it came.I have both a kindle and kindle fire. I love them both.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|The Avengers is an awesome movie! The ending battle is over the top but the kids enjoyed it. Love Captain America!!
B006VA57CY|5.0|I kept seeing this listed and at first said \\"ahh not another soap opera\\". After running into review after review and seeing some of the blogging sites I go to say how good this show was I had to give it a watch.<br /><br />Me and the wife finished the first season in one weekend and after that I was going on a work trip for 5 days. I bought this season and I would download 3 or 4 ep's to my kindle so that I could watch it while in the airport and on the plane. I loved it soon as I got home we watched it again so that she could see them all.<br /><br />I have read up some on the show and I can understand how they manage to get so much right. The budget on this show is crazy. But man it is worth it. This is one of the best shows even if its not factually correct the clothes and environment is it is beautiful.
0439023521|5.0|This book is soooooo cool and exciting and well just thrilling I love the book and I stayed up all night reading it because I couldn't stop.
B00881VLCE|4.0|fun game ! I like it to play on a road trip and my husbands kids love it also !
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book. Very heart wrenching that leaves the reader wanting to continue to the next chapter. The book was GREAT
B0087HT36U|5.0|really enjoyed it. better than angry birds which I couldn't really get into. helps pass the time. worth all .99 cents.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|The only down side to this book is that the third is not published yet. it kept me wanting more.
B008RTE08E|5.0|My DVD arrived and being a Beatle fan it was great, especially the songs. My version appeared tinted red ( faces etc)on my DVD player, but I tried another DVD player and it worked great and the color was fine. 5 Stars in my book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I haven't read this book yet but I have read The Hunger Games and I loved it.  I look forward to reading Catching Fire and Mockinjay soon
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The last book of the series is good enough to keep your interest in how things are gonna be. You can find some surprises on the story, but sometimes things are predictible... That is why I give 4 stars instead of 5. Anyway, The Mockingjay is entertaining and if you can read between lines, the morals and ethics makes you think about how we are developing our society. The book is fun, entertaining and despite the predictible ending makes you ask for more.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|i am halfway through this book and i am HOOKED! its awesome and keeps me surprised. im loving this book its wonderful!!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|It is much easier to search and bid from my Kindle Fire using the ebay app and it was free from Amazon!
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I am not a Kristen Stewart fan and for that reason I almost missed watching this movie. The effects were great. I really like the way the creatures and people were portrayed. The dwarfs were dwarfs as I had always pictures them. Same with the fairies and the trolls. The evil queen was fantastic. The huntsman was well played. Great story.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|A beautiful fun match 3. a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r
B000O8OTNC|5.0|straightforward and very easy to use. sharpened my survival knife to a razor edge...its now part of my survivalist bug out bag in case of economic collapse or some other emergency scenario. love it!
B0098VYCCE|2.0|I expected to really like this based on what others told me of this movie, however this was not the case. I love the \\"idea\\" of this movie but felt it was too dark (seriously disgusting at times). It seems there isn't a happy balance between this movie and Mirror Mirror (which is the absolute opposite of this movie), neither movie was satisfying.<br />  My biggest complaint about this movie was the lack of relationship development and communication. It was absolutely ridiculous. The huntsman kisses her thinking she will never live and then leaves. Right after he leaves she awakens and walks out of the castle as if nothing has happened and gives a speech about fighting the queen. No one ever asks how she awakened. Snow white and the Huntsman don't talk about it. It's maddening! She just came back to life for heavens sake!<br />  This last complaint is probably trivial. While I realize that people did not bathe much back then I still feel that if I kept waiting for them to take a bath the whole movie then it's probably too realistic. Their hygiene shouldn't be a distraction through out the entire movie.<br />  Seriously could have been a cool movie, but it fell short.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|This movie is awesome in some aspects, and there are a few things that I didn't like. Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz are excellent in this movie - the chemistry between them is awesome! Personally, I think that the relationship between Aaron and Marta is much sweeter than what's between Jason and Marie. The romance (not overly drastic) between Aaron and Marta is tender and inspiring; I like Aaron and Marta's characters better overall than Jason and Marie's too. Jason was really cold in the first Bourne movies, while Aaron is sensitive and caring. And no offense to people who like Marie from the first Bourne movies, but you can't even compare Marie with Marta- Rachel Weisz plays a much better character.<br />On another note, this movie is a bit hard to follow and is a bit confusing, but if you take it as a side-story to Bourne, and you know the creators (people that are the heads of different government-based programs) of these super-humans are hunting one of their \\"creations\\" down, and you're there for the ride, it's awesome. (I saw this movie three times in theaters) I'm not much of a fan for the ending of this movie either - I think it is too abrupt like the writers couldn't decide what to do next with the story line.<br /><br />Thus my rating is: Acting- 5 stars; Plot- 3 stars; Action- 5 stars; so overall is 4 to 4.5 stars.<br /><br />I can't wait to get this movie on DVD!
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Weakly carved plot, poorly written dialog, and irritating shards of pop-culture slop thrown in. Not likely appreciated by those looking to enjoy pure sci-fi. Wasted my time and money on this.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Although much effort has been put into this game it just does not feel like a $5 game. It is colorful, simple, and they took some creative spins to Bejeweled, but it just lacks a certain something.<br /><br />No real complaints except I hope the game become exceeding difficult by the last stage.
1616614609|4.0|The Game itself is AMAZING.  great strategy, good balance, and  since each player gets multiple factions to choose from, there is even more replay value.  My only qualm about the game is that the cards seem a bit flimsy but if your careful with them you'll be fine.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app. Reminds me to read - sometimes we all need a nudge to get into the word. And we feel better for it. Live the reading plans because I never seen to know where to start.
B008S80P38|5.0|Deadmau5's latest album, > Album Title Goes Here < is in a word, fantastic. I'll break it down briefly:<br /><br />Superliminal- Great way to kick off the album.<br />Channel 42- I figured the track would be good, but Deadmau5 and Wolfgang Gartner have a hit here. Wonderful.<br />The Veldt- Loved this song before the album came out, and I feel the same way listening to it again.<br />Fn Pig- Beautiful track. The transitions are excellent, and the variation in tempo is amazing.<br />Professional Griefers- Another solid collaboration, this time with Gerard Way from MCR.<br />Maths- Great tempo throughout the track. Definitely one of the best.<br />There Might Be Coffee- I was afraid this track would be less than perfect with the beginning, but it picks up and takes you on a journey. Arguably the best track.<br />Take Care Of The Proper Paperwork- A mouthful of a name, but a great track nonetheless. Another bit of a slow start, but it is worth it to wait.<br />Closer- This track really introduces itself well, and continues into a great track.<br />October- Again, the tempo throughout the song is excellent here.<br />Sleepless- A really chill song. It is a quite a deviation from the previous tracks, but I really enjoyed it. Don't skip this song.<br />Failbait- A surprising inclusion on the album, but I can still tell Deadmau5 is in on the track. Perhaps not as enjoyable as the other tracks, but I still liked it and I think it deserves to be here.<br />Telemiscommunications- The biggest question mark of the album. There's not much of Deadmau5's sound as there was in Failbait, and at times it seems like it is more of an Imogen Heap record rather than Deadmau5. Since I am also a fan of Imogen, I don't mind the track, but I would have liked to hear more of a Deadmau5 sound.<br /><br />Overall, this album is excellent. Being totally honest, if I could I would give the album a 4 1/2 rating, but since I cannot, a 5 it is. A 4 would be too low, which is the reason I did not rate it that way. I have seen that some are complaining that the album lacks a certain flow, but do all his albums have to be Random Album Title? No, and I am glad that it is not that way. An artist should be allowed to do something different, and Deadmau5 has done that rather successfully. If you have ever been a Deadmau5 fan, buy this album. Once you listen, you will not regret it.
B001NLCBJI|5.0|Let me say that this is one of my top 5 movies. Bill should have won the Oscar & Scarlett is a living doll. I've never seen her look better. I Love this movie. That being said, I have the DVD which was ok but the Blu Ray is better. The quality could have been much better though. At times it looks like my DVD & other times it looks like Blu Ray.  It's not great quality at all times but it's still better than the DVD & for the price, why not go for it. I wish I knew what Bill whispered to Scarlett at the end. Maybe it's good not to know though. This has the best opening shot of any movie I've ever seen. You guys & some gals will know what I mean !!!!!  The review is \\"Not\\" from Amazon Instant Video, but from the actual Blu Ray disc.
B0094GW6YE|5.0|Great record for the Kiss fans and Hard Rock fans! Gene, Paul, Eric and Tommy are in great shape and tight!! Go on and buy it!!!
034580404X|5.0|I am sad that I have finished reading these three books. They were exciting & leave me wanting more!  Just get through the rough stuff at the beginning and dive into the sultry rest of the books!  M from Austin Texas
B0064UPU4G|5.0|If you like Raves, specifically Car Raves on long trips, this is the Collection to have! No Joke. Just add fog machine and glowsticks- Confuses Truckers and the smoke makes you look like Snoop Dog when you get out of the car at a rest stop. Nice Jorb, Great collection of Daft Punk's Musik. Must have if you don't have it, but if you have it, then you don't need it. Rave on: um-tz, um-tz, um-tz! (It's my rave beat sound effect- it's much better in person).
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is super addictive! I really like to graphics. The music is sweet. I strongly recommend this  game. I would have paid for this game. Thank you Amazon. Thank you game developers.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Book was better than expected. I was a little leary because I'm not into the bdsm stuff but it was really tame. You definitely have to read all three books the way it's written.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was drawn to this book because of my love of the Harry Potter series. I of course knew that it wouldnt be anything like the Harry Potter series, but my respect for JK Rowling and her ability to transport me to another world through her writing was what I expected. I must admit, I hated this book.  I knew that this was written for adults, but come on.  The language, the graphic sexual content, and frankly the boring topic made it impossible for me to complete the book.  The question I have is if JK Rowling did not have the previous successes that she already had, would this book even have been published?  My opinion is no.
B00914JWSW|4.0|I was really torn between giving five stars and the four that I decided to award Barbra Streisand's latest release, RELEASE ME CD, because I'm such a rabid fan that I could very easily give everything she's released, from movies to music to books, five stars; but then that wouldn't be very objective on my part.<br /><br />There are many standouts on this CD including the Astrud Gilberto inspired \\"Lost In Wonderland\\" that sounds wonderfully like the \\"The Girl From Ipanema,\\" with Barbra handling the flowing Bossa Nova vocals with the greatest of ease, and \\"Mother And Child\\" where she sings a duet with herself much like \\"One Less Bell To Answer/A House Is Not A Home\\" from [[ASIN:B0012GN0T4 Barbra Joan Streisand]]. More gems include \\"Being Good Isn't Good Enough,\\" \\"Willow Weep For Me,\\" \\"Try To Win A Friend,\\" and the studio version of \\"Didn't We,\\" which had a live version on [[ASIN:B0012GN2LA Live Concert at the Forum]]. Though the songs were recorded at different times and for different album projects, one can easily understand that these songs could have fit on any one of Streisand's various albums from [[ASIN:B00005V3XG The Broadway Album]] to [[ASIN:B0012GN49U Lazy Afternoon]]. Stylistically they sound complete.<br /><br />There are some tracks that miss the mark, however. Not so much in quality, but they have a feel of being demo or rehearsal versions rather than being actual songs that might have been released as singles or included on an album.<br /><br />One of the songs from [[ASIN:B000AYEL1A A Star is Born]], \\"With One More Look At You\\" was featured on the [[ASIN:B00005V3XL A Star Is Born]] soundtrack, making its appearance in the finale, paired with \\"Watch Closely Now,\\" and was recorded live with a slightly different cut than what was featured in the movie. Here, the song is in its entirety but it sounds more of an experiment in trying to find the right style, vocally, rather than just being a stand alone cut. Even if it were included on the ASIB album it would have sounded off.<br /><br />Streisand is in fine voice and the orchestra sounds superb, which isn't the problem; however, the note and chord changes, along with the melisma, lead me to believe this was a demo or rehearsal. I'm not sure if I'm using the right wording, but once you listen to the song you'll understand what I mean.<br /><br />Likewise, the song \\"Home\\" from [[ASIN:B000002I8P The Wiz - The Super Soul Musical: Original Cast Album (1975 Broadway Cast)]]. It starts off really well and Barbra puts her own stamp on it, which is very hard to do since Stephanie Mills's version, including her re-recording of the song featured on 1989's [[ASIN:B000002O68 Home]], is considered the definitive version. Anyway, the song starts off great but then loses steam about midway through.<br /><br />Life long fans of Streisand -- like myself -- know that she can more than handle the frenetic pacing of a song like \\"Home,\\" which is similar in vein to songs like \\"Don't Rain On My Parade,\\" \\" Before The Parade Passes By,\\" and \\"Somewhere,\\" among scores of others, that are explosive ballad/torch songs that separate the chorus girls from the divas, so it isn't skill that keeps \\"Home\\" from being another stand out track on this CD. Like \\"With One More Look...,\\" it sounds like \\"Home\\" is more of a demo/rehearsal track.<br /><br />About midway through it sounds as if Streisand loses interest or is concentrating on something else, and the song is no longer from the \\"actress who sings,\\" where each song is sung and interpreted like a play, but just another song by any other person. But towards the end, she picks up with some conviction and \\"Home\\" sounds like a song that's viable. It's very hard to describe in words, but once you hear it you'll understand what I mean.<br /><br />I know that this CD is supposed to be composed of unreleased tracks that will invariably contain demos and rehearsals that were not fit to be released, but I thought that you should know.<br /><br />There's some incidental dialogue on some of the tracks, which is a nice touch, giving the listener a feel of being behind-the-scenes, but it's very short lasting for only a few seconds.<br /><br />My hopes was that RELEASE ME was going to be like [[ASIN:B0000026IH Just for the Record]] and contain amazing stuff that's never been available on CD or albums. Even though there's some really good stuff on here, I was hoping for the live recordings of \\"The Way We Were,\\" and \\"Evergreen\\" that Barbra performed during the concert filming of A Star Is Born, which was seen in a documentary that aired once called \\"Barbra: With One More Look.\\" Or how about the 60s recordings of her stints at the Bon Soir and the Hungry I?<br /><br />The CD comes with a booklet with EXCELLENT liner notes by Jay Landers, who has produced many of Streisand's albums, a note from Barbra, and also has some color and black and white pictures from various recording sessions and publicity shots.<br /><br />Reading from the liner notes and I've come to find that there is a vault somewhere that contains master reels of the ENTIRE [[ASIN:B0012GMZR2 Happening in Central Park]] concert (I read that the 1968 free concert in the park was 2 hours long, but the soundtrack was whittled down to just under 40-minutes) and live recordings from the Bon Soir, the Hungry I, and other concerts, along with EVERY recording Streisand has ever made! That means there's a treasure trove of stuff just waiting for us fans to discover.<br /><br />Also, Landers makes note of a live performance of \\"Didn't We,\\" which Barbra performed on the David Frost Show, and will be included, wait for it... on a multi-DVD box-set career retrospective called, \\"Barbra Streisand: My Life In Words And Music.\\" I CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT!<br /><br />I've looked for that DVD box set, but it isn't showing up on Amazon so stay tuned kiddies!idental dialogue on some of the tracks, which is a nice touch, giving the listener a feel of being behind-the-scenes, but it's very short lasting for only a few seconds.<br /><br />My hopes was that RELEASE ME was going to be like [[ASIN:B0000026IH Just for the Record]] and contain amazing stuff that's never been available on CD or albums.

B0088TG252|4.0|This movie is entertaining. It is a big budget blockbuster with predictability but what did you really expect?<br />I enjoyed my fun couple hours pretending to be a FBI agent.
B00943SP0G|1.0|I can't believe I paid to buy this movie.  Should have rented at redbox and I still would have felt like I paid too much.
B005LAIHR2|4.0|If you love musicals and 80's rock, you'll enjoy this movie. The story was typical, but it was still fun to watch. I was hesitant when I found out Tom Cruise would be playing a rock star, but I have to give him props for playing someone totally out of his character.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a very fun and satisfying game. It was a good choice for app of the day. Try it I think you will like it too.
B008WCP2PG|2.0|Dance scenes were great, but the writing was terrible. It was enjoyable for about the first half hour, after that I was bored to tears. Had the story been written better, this movie would have been worth my while.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app works great with kindle fire. It has a very user friendly interface and makes repinning a snap. I highly recommend this app if you love pinning.
B009CPRYG2|3.0|I will offer this sentiment.  As a fan of the comic I found the visual translation for the most part excellent.  There were some miscues and things that I just don't think they did correctly but it was for the most part accurate.  What ruined it for me in many ways was the lack of the third voice.  In the comic they let you hear what the characters were thinking.  This added so much emotion and sometimes humor to the story.  This not being included was such a huge miss.  There were jokes unfinished and for the most part really made me miss the comic.  The other miss was Peter Weller.  He delivered his lines like Robocop...emotionless.  There was no grit in his voice.  Overall after paying for this I do not plan to get the second one.  It was just not enjoyable for me.  My son however did see it and not having a sense of the comics like it.  This is the only reason it gets an ok instead of dislike.  Guess if you don't know the comic you'll find it likable.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is perfect tool with online and offline resources. You can find nearly every version imaginable with the ability to store them for offline usage. there are even devo plans with reminders. incredible  resource.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Loved this book.  While many of the characters were pretty unlikeable, I still couldn't wait to see what happened to them.  Ms. Rowling is a consummate storyteller and this book is no different from HP in that regard.  It's dark, yes.  It's certainly not for kids but really, can't we all recognize a bit of each of these creeps in some of the people we run into in our daily lives?  Their innermost thoughts are just what I imagine certain acquaintances and co-workers have in their heads too! :-)  I look forward to more books in the adult genre from Ms. Rowling.
B008NW67E0|5.0|As good as their last CD if not better. Songs are complex, lyrics are beautiful, good job guys. I think I've had it playing non-stop in my car for about 2 weeks now and still don't have everything memorized.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|I greatly enjoyed reading this novel. Coming of Age fantasy is a particular favorite of mine, and it is always a pleasure to come across a new author who does the genre well. The pacing is dead on without ever seeming to drag. We don't spend the entire book dragging through the tedious details of how Vaelin develops. Instead, we get the high points with enough flavoring. Huge chunks of time are smoothly glossed over when possible, keeping the story moving. I also enjoyed the interlocutory chapters with the historian. It provides an interesting interpretation of events and reminds us that history is often written by the victors.<br /><br />The land itself is absolutely fascinating, and Mr. Ryan gives us world-building without bogging the reader down in tedious description. The Faith is chilling in its simplicity, and I love how the King manages to twist it and the Orders to suit his purposes. I also loved the internal struggles of the main character as he strove to balance his duty to the faith with the actions he needed to take. No petty whining for page after page, which seems to be a hallmark of most novels in this genre. He accepts his abilities and his place in the kingdom with a determination to do the best he can, staying true to his Faith and his Order while still maintaining his humanity.<br /><br />Even more exceptional is the overall lack of typos. Even some of my favored authors seem to have have a ridiculous number of types creeping into their works, especially those delivered to the Kindle. Not quite sure why that is, but I've purchased novels from established authors that had a large number of distracting typos or formatting errors seemingly every other screen/page.<br /><br />I look forward to Mr. Ryan's next book and seeing what happens in this saga.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Although the subject matter was unsettling to me, because of the notoriety I decided to give it a try and was blown away.  The S&M \\"sessions\\" were harsh and not for the quesy-hearted but if you get beyond that the book was mesmerizing and the actual love story was unexpected.  I recommend it to anyone who is looking for something different; but, don't leave it where grandma can find it.
0062124293|5.0|An absolute must read for the modern feminist!  This book has made me laugh out loud and/or laugh to tears on several occasions whilst providing thoughtful content on a whole range of issues effecting women.  Get it, you won't regret it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I like this app.  Its just like at the fair! Just started playing it - too early to tell any cons yet.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|simple but addictive.  Its a good thing I ran out of coins last night or I would have been up all night playing coin dozed!
0393061310|4.0|Guns, Germs and Steel is an engaging read with a provocative thesis. It is written by a serious scientist but reads like a Gladwell treatise. I would give it 4.5 starts if I could, but it doesn't quite deserve 5 stars because it gets tedious toward the end and it isn't quite as grounded as the best works in the genre (e.g. Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow).
B00992CF6W|5.0|Runs great on my Kindle Fire. I hear MC:PE is similar to the PC version before Minecraft was what it is today.<br /><br />Hopefully there will be armor in the next update. It would be nice if torches were brighter and lit up larger areas. The controls took me awhile to get used to, but I think the split screen option is easier for me. I
B009GEAPYW|4.0|Very good & generally true to original story line, animated version of Frank Miller's classic.  Recommended for any Batman or Frank Miller fan.
0930289234|5.0|This world that Dave Gibbons and Alan Moore have created, still lives in my brain.<br />Its been twenty-four years since I read it last.<br /><br />First the very sneaky trick Alan Moore pulled, to make a character who bilocates and tricolates<br />Through time in Dr. Manhattan, who obviously is a raja-yogi.<br /><br />Ozymandias and Dr. Manhattan are the same being. Dr. Manhattan can move back through<br />Time as well to create mystic effects.<br /><br />Gibbons is not only a competent renderer, but a fine designer of this world as well.<br /><br />Moore's type of plot-heavy writing I like anyhow. I make myself feel better about it by saying<br />That Moore made this book in twelve pieces.<br /><br />A must read for writers.
0316228532|5.0|Well written. Rowlings captures the diverse personalities of the town's characters and their foibles.  Poignant in the descriptions of the intertwined relationships of the characters.
1439156816|4.0|What can I say. Stephen King decided not to tell anyone about his writing process (At least in the first edition).<br />  Stephen wrote a book in a drug induced haze, and this one seems to be the same case. According to the title of the<br />  book, I was expecting Stephen King to teach how to write a novel, dark fantasy or otherwise. Even though the second<br />  title 'A Memoir Of The Craft' warns you not to expect this.<br /><br />  Let me first tell you what Stephen wrote, and then I will tell you what I expected. Stephen writes autobiographically<br />  in the first half of this book, talking about his university time, the unpleasant job he had to do, how his wife helped<br />  him with his writing, and how he managed to pull himself out of all of this to become one of the best selling writers<br />  in the English speaking world (and otherwise).<br /><br />  In the second half of the book, Stephen goes into too much detail about punctuation and how to construct good writing.<br />  And that is the end of the book.<br /><br />  Now let me tell you what I expected. I expected Stephen to teach me how to write a story. This means I wanted to<br />  learn beginning, middle, and end. I wanted to learn literary writing, as E.M. Forster would have put it, something<br />  more than 'what's next?' The good thing is that over the course of five years I grew old enough to learn from various<br />  sources (such as Forster) how to write a novel. Well not exactly write a novel, but enough of a high level overview<br />  of this craft to be able to write one with three to four years effort.
B001MSMULG|5.0|This is, I think, one of Mr. Silva´s most accomplished thrillers. The intrigue and suspense is very well paced and the plot throughly thought out.  The only part of the novel that is somewhat less than good is that  Jacqueline (Ms. Delacroix) being a top high fashion model is not likely to have been accepted by the Tariq, (the shrewd terrorist) as likely secretary of an art gallery.  This would been highly suspicious right from he start of that phase.<br /><br />H. Dothée

B0087HT36U|3.0|it takes a while to figure out how everything works btlut once u do its fun. I'm stuck right now but I will entually get through. its just like angry birds but kind of easier.
B005HSL626|5.0|One of my favorite games! I really like it and it works great on my kindle fire! I would especially recommend it for kids and teenagers.
B008KRJWEK|4.0|I didn't like it at first but its growing on me. I love the weapons and hope you will love this too
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love it! Its really fun and kind of addicting! If you are thinking about getting it you really should!
B0098VYKSA|3.0|Good and entertaining movie, also an interesting, fresh take on the Snow White tale.  However the ending made me forget I really enjoyed it while I was watching it....
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Love it! It works great on kindle fire. Its one of my favorite games to play. Great for all ages.
B008XG1X18|3.0|lately its been forcing me to close the app. after a couple of times of closing app it works usually. never had problems until recently. please fix! I enjoy this app just been having problems lately!
B005LAIHPY|1.0|Love this genre, but this movie felt very \\"dumb\\"<br /><br />It was as if the whole alien invasion scenario was there to support the badboy characters transition into a responsible person.<br /><br />I felt I lost a few IQ points for having watched the 1st 45 minutes.<br /><br />I'm guessing the casting director had something on Liam for him to be involved in this waste of extremely good special effects.
B000ICZD4I|4.0|Because I can't give half star ratings, Amazon doesn't let you, I technically gave this 4 stars, but my official rating is 4.5 stars. The disc (& the rest of the order it came with) arrived on the earliest day of the delivery time frame, so no complaints there.<br />The DVD was, as far as I can tell, NEW, just as it was listed.<br />The disc is unblemished, & although I only did a brief watching, skipping chapters to make sure there where no problem with the disc, the movie looks great visually with great audio.<br />If you already like this movie & want a great DVD version, this is the best deal.<br />There is a newer \\"anniversary edition\\" available, but from what I read online, the only extras over this version are outtakes & deleted scenes & costs $4 more. This version & the anniversary edition are extend director cuts, so I'm not sure what more deleted scenes the newer disc has.<br />I fully recommend this item.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I can not believe we have to wait until Fall 2013 for the next one.<br />Good mix of characters. Looking forward to how it all gets resolved.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|This book was a great follow on from the first, Fall of the Giants. You actually felt as though you were in the black, cold parts of the world with them. It was very hard to put the book down, cant wait for final book.
1400049628|5.0|This book is amazing, it is in great condition, this book is like my bible, i read one section per night nd take notes, ppl thing im crazy, i think im prepared :D
0446573027|3.0|It was an enjoyable read, although not enoough of a lengthy intereswting chronicle and a bit too much preachy.  Balducci has and can do better.  I look forward to his next effort.
B007XC9BSK|3.0|If you don't have time, read my summary, otherwise scroll down to read my whines :-)<br /><br />Summary:<br />Things I like:<br />1) Nice display case for all the micro cars. Can put cars facing sideway or forward.<br />2) Has a built in car launcher, launch up to 6 cars (launcher is at the bottom row). Stores 18 cars.<br />3) Window opens down for a pretend mini ramp<br />4) Nice details on Mack and big McQueen stickers on the back of storage case<br />5) Mack can be detached from the storage for play.<br /><br />Things I don't like:<br />1) No working wheels! Entire Mack won't roll. :-(<br />2) Pricey<br />3) Doesn't come with any car at all<br />4) Hinges feels flimsy. It feels like it can break easily<br />5) Hard to open window, hard to launch cars thus difficult for the littlest ones in the age recommendation to operate<br /><br />I purchased all the micro cars and saw this case available to hold the cars.  For almost twenty bucks, it would be nicer if the storage case comes with 1 car.  At the very least, moveable wheels.  Yes I know it is a storage case but which kids (or adult) won't want to push Mack around for a ride?  It is dissapointing to see Mack with nice wheels, but all fake.  It is advertised as \\"Mack also has drifting action\\".  It has one big bead underneath Mack's hub cab but it is pretty heavy. It doesn't drift like the micro cars.  The storage case itself doesn't have a bead. So you are more likely scratch your floor or wood furniture if your child try to drag Mack and the storage for a ride.  Why can't the manufacturer just make moveable wheels  instead of trying to be fancy and put a bead underneath? On the bright side, you can detach Mack's front to play with it.<br /><br />The case itself is nice. The clear window opens downward. This gives you a short \\"ramp\\" if your child decides to roll it down on the clear window.  You can also use the launcher to blast off the micro cars. The lever's spring is too hard and thus more difficult for a 3 year old to launch the car.<br /><br />Hope my review helps!
B009MF56GC|5.0|I think getting Kurt on the team would be a major plus as long as he comes in as his Snake Plisskin character from the \\"Escape from\\" flicks. As far as Seagal is concerned he needs to drop about 50+ pounds before being considered. Way too many trips to the fridge since his Above the Law days.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This game has reasonable permissions (thank you!) and some nice graphics.  The backstory is neat accompanied by some beautifully animated cut scenes and nice audio.  It lost a star for its normal price which is too high for a match 3 game that does not include anything but story mode.  Other match 3 games like The treasures of Montezuma have story mode, blitz and endless with just as nice graphics for less money.  I am not sure what happens when you finish the games seven levels, but there just does not seem like much to do other then the one game mode.  Still, it's a different take on match 3 and if you like these kinds of games you will definitely enjoy this title.<br /><br />Thank you!
B008MJC6ZS|5.0|This album is awesome.  I stopped listening to Testament after Souls of Black because the next album (The Ritual) was not very good.  So, I kind of lost track of Testament over the years.  I'm glad I decided to sample this album on Amazon's website.  I'm going to have to sample the other Testament albums that I missed.  I'm very glad to see that a lot of heavy metal bands from the 80's that changed their sound are coming back as good if not better than they were in the 80's.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|good little time waster<br />works well on droid2<br />had to turn down the volume because the music annoyed me but some people might like it
B00000739O|5.0|You draw a person to you..then you...then you..kill them. How'd you get your KICKS? How sick is that? Coney Island Baby is auto-biographical with Lou singing about his high school football days. I wanna play football for the coach, sung in the  most deadpan brainwashed way. Coach must have been a force to be reckoned with. Training camp must have been fun. You know they say that camp is more than a row of tents. What else can I say about this suburban masterpiece, Oh Yeah, I love the cover photo.
B00065MDS6|5.0|This album made people mad back then. After the first two fine psychedelic rock albums King stripped their gears and went into hyperdrive. It's wonderful is what I'm trying to say. The 23:30 minute title cut has no less than YES lead singer Jon Anderson doing the honors. The other songs are definitely twisted. The cover art is fascinating. The lyrics are Peter Sinfield at his finest spaced-out aliteration. Fripp is a musical genius. The musicianship is excellent. Great underrated album. This will test your ability to be open about new art.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Really nice on the Kindle Fire. Beginning levels are not too frantic but get harder as you progress, just as you'd expect. The touch could be more responsive on my Fire as sometimes I have to make two attempts to slide the jewels around.
B0010X745K|5.0|This is a great horror film.  Darabont does a great job downplaying the usual low-rent SK character studies (or whatever they are supposed to be) and bringing forward the horror.  King is a great idea man, but I'm afraid his appeal for me stops there.  This is the best adaptation of a King story for just those reasons.  Relentlessly downbeat (I guess I'll give King that, he doesn't sugar-coat his endings.)
0307730697|5.0|I'm not sure of how I heard about this book, but it made my wish list and I ordered it. I finished it around 1:30AM this morning and it truly is an amazing story! There is an 11-minute documentary about Adam Brown on the NRA Life of Duty website, but it barely scratches the surface of who Adam was and what he went through (or rather, what he put himself through).<br /><br />This book is a definite must-read!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|you have to get this amazing spiderman game this is a free roam game and if you want you calan do missions noothing can stop this game from being awesome trust me the only bad thing is that you have to download this thingy and it takes an hour. get this game!
B0088OINTU|5.0|I originally saw Lawrence of Arabia in New York City the first week it was released.  I was awe-struck and returned to the theater 8 more times.  Over the years, I cannot count how many times I've seen it.  Everything in it works:  the story, the script, the direction, the acting, the cinematography, musical score, the magnificent editing....and so on.  I'm looking forward to receiving the restored version which will be released in a few weeks.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|This is perhaps the most boring of the Reacher books. Almost nothing happens until<br />that last 50 pages.  The big plot uncovered barely makes any sense at all.<br /><br />I am huge Reacher fan..but this is not a good book...
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|It is one of those movies I will want to watch multiple times.  The cast includes big stars who are a joy to watch and two young actors I hope to see more of.
B000002VRZ|5.0|The disk was shipped quickly, was well packed and arrived on time. I really like the Green Grass and High Tides song. It's one of my favorites. If you like country rock, this is it.
B007YYY5TW|5.0|CBS was supposed to show last season's finale of The Good Wife the week before the start of the new season, but it was bumped by a football game. I went to Amazon and viewed the episode before the new season began so I would be up-to-date. It was quick and easy and I trust the site.
0525953728|5.0|The media was all over this as disclosing SECRETS....not so....just through the eyes of one that puts his life on the line in order for us to enjoy the freedoms that others fought and died for.<br /><br />Barack H. Obama says, \\"Osama is dead\\".  These bravehearts get the credit.  Let's not forget, so is Amabssador Stevens and Agent Terry.  Still a BIG secret.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|This movie has no real sense of plotting or pace. The final confrontation with Bane is so lousy. (Catwoman shoots him, and that's it. Yikes, that's awful.) The plot twist, where we find out Bane isn't even the main villain, was quite possibly the worst thing Nolan could've done to us. It made little sense and felt completely unnecessary.<br /><br />The plot holes and continuity errors are very noticeable: the sudden shift from day to night after the Wall Street heist took me out of the movie for a few minutes, and why did Bane take Gotham City hostage for THREE MONTHS? Obviously it was so Bruce could have enough time to return, but Bane didn't think he would. It was a lazy plot device by the filmmakers. Everyone keeps praising Anne Hathaway for her performance as Catwoman, but I can't help wonder what was so special. She practically whispered every line in the movie and that's it.<br /><br />I've never liked Nolan's disrespectful approach to the material, refusing to use some of the best villains just because they're silly, never referring to Catwoman AS Catwoman, changing the Batmobile to some dumb, ugly tank. He nearly ruined Batman for me, especially with this sad last film and its cliched nuclear-bomb finale. That was sillier than Killer Croc and The Penguin put together.<br /><br />I know my review sounds like I hated the movie, but I liked certain elements, as well as the overall tone. Just barely.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Have thoroughly enjoyed this app. Saves me the expense and bother of two different electronic \\"toys\\"!<br />Reading is enjoyable again
B008YW5RH2|5.0|this game is the best.  people always buy differennt sport games bcus they don't no about this 1.  try something new and buy this game, and then u will realize how amazing it really is
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I was surprise when my home theater was working all 5 speakers surround sound, good experience all together and the price for HD was ok too(same price in the video rent near by)
B0058YPILY|5.0|Great season. Can't wait for the next one (here in Latin America we have a long delay to see it). Keep up the good work!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|a really fun. game to play on. any weathery type of day.the point is that it is really fun.trust me.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very interesting, very different for a mystery.  The dislike for Amazing Amy grew and grew all through the book.  But, she did get the last word.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Love this game - loaded it for my grandson to play but I am hooked!!<br />  Would recommend this for any age.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|I hate to say this but... finally Dylan has put out a song I just can't stand.  The title track The Tempest is a dreadful song on an otherwise good album.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|I really enjoyed it but had the same crash issues as other DX2 users.  I would love to see them fix this so I can play more
B007SSEU9O|4.0|The movie didn't really strike me as a great political biopic with its focus on Thatcher in her dotage, as it makes her appear. But Streep again shows why she deserved the Oscar for this performance. I'd definitely recommend this movie to Streep fans but not necessarily to Thatcher fans.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|\\"The Book of Eli\\" is an excellent post-apocalyptic tale in a similar vein of \\"Mad Max\\" and the more recent \\"The Road\\".  In fact, I would recommend watching \\"The Road\\" and this in the same sitting, as they compliment each other.  While \\"Road\\" is more realistic in terms of survival in that type of setting, \\"Eli\\" is the more adventurous and action oriented.  Very fine performances of everyone involved, and Denzel skillfully plays a man with a very distinct mission at hand.  This is one of the few movies by the very underrated Hughes Brothers (see \\"From Hell\\" with Johnny Depp to see what other excellent work they are capable of) and the first one they have done in a long time.  There is a very distinct religious overtone to the movie, but if you read between the lines it leaves it to the viewer to decide if things happen due to pre-destination or by chance.  Overall, I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys this type of subject matter,
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoyed this game because there r so many different games to play and unlock!!!!! also it is amazing!!:)
B0054R6BFM|5.0|It really made me think. it helps you imagine that the simplest interaction with them can affect a persons thoughts.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|As always much better than the movie. i almost didn't read it because i saw the movie and didn't think i needed to. I'm glad i did!
B005K17RU0|1.0|My android tablet runs most everything but it can not deal with this app.  It refuses to connect to the server although every other app connects just fine.
1423124111|5.0|This is a great book for anyone that is interested in Disney.  The pictures in the book are great.  It is neat to see them compare posters from the various Disney Parks across the World.
1400082773|1.0|I'm barely through the first chapter and the lies being told are almost intolerable.  When Obama tells of his family's past; it's the way HE THINKS IT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN! Where he so obviously lied about the \\"Japanese-American man\\" who phoned Obama telling him he bears witness to the barroom incident involving his father those many years ago!  The chinaman had no name of course although he supposedly was a college classmate with his father. I don't intend to read much further but will use the book as a testimonial to the character of a phony called Obama: a politician.
B005LCECU6|5.0|Probably not for the casual listener. Would be better suited for those who want to hear the band as they were, or the fan that wants to add another CD to their vast Rush collection. Very raw sounding. A sign-of-the-times piece...
0439023521|3.0|I'm writing about the hunger games I was practically held at gun point and forced to read it so a 3 star rating should be seen as a high honor considering I had no other options. I'll start off by giving a brief summary of the story, the main characters name is Katniss and she lives in a post war world in which the government has total control of 12 districts. They exploit the total control by forcing 24 children to fight to the death every year. Katnisses sister is chosen to be one of the 24 children but Katness volunteers instead. Her partner in the fight is a boy who saved her family by throwing her bread years ago. They go through brief training and are put into a computer controlled arena in which they fight the other 22 children to the death.<br /><br />  In my opinion the book has its \\"wow this is boring!\\" mements and its \\"wow thats cool\\" moments. But in my opinion the book was slightly boring and drawn out with a few enjoable moments. I would reccomend this book to 5-8th grade girls which seems to be the target audence anyway. The plot is quite intresting because its relateable to what might happen if the govenment goets to big/Obama gets reelected. The whole idea of a government nuking its own people is quite intrested.The world in which this oocures seems to be similar to fallout 3/fallout new vegas atmosphere
B009QW7HMC|5.0|Season one was awesome, season two almost lost me but the plot twists kept me around. Season 3 looks very promising. More zombies, more action, less whining and talking about emotions. They are actually doing things that make sense. hard to find in any zombie show/movie. It seems to be taking a darker turn and I love it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Saw the movie and was very intrigued by the story. I picked up the first book and had to read the second. Did some decent recapping so if this is your first you won't be lost. Great story with an awesome ending that leaves you dying to find out how it ends. Already picked up the third. Cannot wait.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I am a big fan of Greek mythology,and a friend told me about it. I recently started reading the Heroes of Olympus serieds,and I can't get my hands off of my Kindle! However,I just wanted to do a customer review. I don't want to spoil this book,so I am just going to say.......READ THIS BOOK!
B008KRJWEK|4.0|This one is lots of fun on the Kindle Fire.  I'm getting a bit addicted though and it looks like I'll be spending some more money for upgrades!
0345803493|4.0|The tension continues into the second book.  The reader is intrigued by the question can Christian change?  Will they make it? What will their relationship look like in the end? There are subplots that add to the story raising the stakes and increasing the tension.  The doubts Ana expresses about the relationship are in her mind, are repetitive and overdone. The pearls are in the struggles between Ana and Christian. These are well done. In summary: I enjoyed the second book.  It was a good read.<br />I would recommend it.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|Update 5-26-13: after completing the map, there was no continuing challenge. Although the map completion was fun, repeating the map posted no challenge & this game loses another star for lack of continued playability. It has since been deleted from my kindle & glad it was the FAOTD!<br /><br />Original review:  match 3 with a twist or two... lots of fun with bonus buttons and a story to boot! what better adventure than to save Atlantis!??? the music is good but can get repetitive and annoying...thus the loss of one star; but so worth a download!
0345529057|5.0|First off let me say, I read the series right before this came on HBO.  It ... is... fantastic... if you're looking in to these because you watched the series, don't hesitate!  Surprisingly the books follow along well with the series, but as with any book, they leave so much out!  Even if you already know the basic outcome of each book, you'll learn so many new plot twists and details about the characters, that by the time you get to the end of the book, it'll come as a surprise all over again.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this was a great game..and well worth the money. I was addicted from the very beginning. definately a few hours of play and worth every minute of it. worked great on kindle fire.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I was have this game in my laptob and now I can play it on my tablet is perfect is and adventure of match 3 that I don't get bore,have wonderfull graficts and a great sound. we need more like this :-)

B004MC8CA2|4.0|I first used this electronic Bible as an app for my iPhone a few years ago and was very pleased when I found it was also available for my Kindle fire HD. This Bible allows me to quickly shift between various translations when reading scripture; I love the ability to download my most used versions for use when I am off-line.  I can bookmark favorite passages and take advantage of its other features.  I am very pleased.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love pinterest. i use it for everything and more... so addicted i csnt stay away from it for too long!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Absolutely outstanding production.  World class acting, scenery, costumes.  One of our favorite British series of all time.  Top notch actors and actresses.  Each section ends with us wanting more and wishing it wasn't over.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|Although Mr. Dylan has now passed 70 years old, he continues to regularly release albums, and they have been uniformly excellent. Tempest is no exception. Brilliant songwriting and some wonderful music in all genres. Of course his voice is completely shot (as it has been for years), but that doesn't take away from the brilliance of many of these songs. Once you get used to the fact that Dylan now sounds like Louis Armstrong (intentionally?), you can just sit back and let these beauties take over your heart, mind, and soul. Great stuff!
B008PE9GSA|5.0|With the exception of one song... this is the best ZZ Top LP in years. Favorite tracks: Chartreuse, Comsumption, Heartache In Blue & Have A Little Mercy.  tc'
0525953728|5.0|Not only is the book informative about the killing of Osama Bin-Laden, but it gives great insight to a group of exceptionally brave men.  The sacrifice these men dedicate to their country is truly amazing.  They are able to do a job that very few would have the courage, desire, or  fortitude to undertake.  The book illustrates an interesting perspective of the team, the training, and self-sacrifice they put themselves through.  I was surprised to learn how many times they are deployed in a year.  They do not seek accolades or medals, they just perform a job that others can't imagine.<br />The descriptions of the missions they undertake are vividly described in the book. The final mission to apprehend Bin-Laden is riveting; the bravery and ability to react and overcome the unexpected is truly rare. This is a must read for those who are vets, curious onlookers, or the random public.  It is one that allows you to see how brave men perform. The book is a good, exciting, fast read.

B008O9V4C2|5.0|It was my friend Henrique who put it best about Donald Fagen's music,that it has continued to age like fine wine. Filled with color and a good flavor. Well I myself am not a wine connoisseur myself,but at the same time I can definitely understand the metaphor. At a time when the music scene had seriously changed to the point where it shouldn't have accommodated the music he makes,albums such as his debut [[ASIN:B000002KXV The Nightfly]] in the early 80's and the follow up [[ASIN:B000002MIY Kamakiriad]] a decade later showcased that he had a sound AND a musical understanding that made him very generationally transcendental. He and Walter Beckers devotion to their craft,attention to detail and overall perfectionism as well as their way around top notch song craft probably helped them survive in more persnickety music fans after the 1980's. Though as always critically acclaimed I really don't think Fagen's previous solo album [[ASIN:B000E5N62U Morph the Cat]] captured the public's musical spirit the way his previous solo records had or his Steely Dan comeback releases. Having completed a personal life cycle related conceptual trilogy with that Fagen teamed up with Michael Leonhart here to restart his solo career from another perspective.<br /><br />  Overall the impression of this album is that it's likely the most out and out hard funk recording Fagen has made thus far. That especially goes for the opener \\"Slinky Thing\\",\\"The New Breed\\" and the deep,wah wah powered \\"Miss Marlene\\" in particular. Of course on these tunes he is again exploring old style romanticism through the filter of age and modern awkwardness. \\"Memorabilia\\" returns to the slicker,jazzier production of classic Steely Dan a bit on a compelling tale of character named Louis Dakine who,from the nature of his \\"memorabilia\\" was one of the military personnel involved in atomic tests in the Marshall Islands. I have a few favorites of my own of course. \\"I'm Not The Same Without You\\" has the potential with it's strong melody and hook to be his modern day \\"Tomorrow's Girls\\" commercially,in terms of hit potential. It has a strong,well produced live band disco/funk sound not too far removed from Steely Dan's \\"Glamour Profession\\" (though more upbeat melodically) and takes about a relationship whose ending actually benefited Fagen rather than was a detriment. On \\"Weather In My Head\\",one of those great bluesy jazz grooves of his he uses the metaphor of global warming,even evoking the name of \\"Mr.Gore\\" himself to describe his confused emotional state.<br /><br />  On \\"Out Of The Ghetto\\",his first cover song since his debut thirty years earlier that funk spirit of this album is affirmed by this Isaac Hayes number praising his girlfriend for her \\"ghetto fabulousness\\" and ability to maintain her dignity at the same time. That jazzier Steely Dan type flavor is maintained well across \\"Good Stuff\\" and \\"Planet D'Rhonda\\". As for Donald Fagen his musical abilities and faithfulness to his craft have apparently never abandoned him. As a matter of fact he seems to have learned from his previous solo recording as well. Many of these songs are infused with a welcomed return to his way with melodic song craft,but it's not only that aspect that makes this such a vital and strong comeback. Long regarded for his devotion to the most complex of lyrical implication,Fagen has been learning a lot from the funk era (of which he was of course a part with Steely Dan) about how to project this aspect of his talent in a way that's totally relatable. This means that the songs here are both musically and lyrically creative,intelligent and witty as well as being completely accessible to the people as well. Of course his inclusion of a lyric sheet here probably adds to that as well. I praise Fagen for emphasizing the heavy funk groove side of his musicianship much as he did with Steely Dan on albums like [[ASIN:B00003002D The Royal Scam]]. It really shows how this often neglected genre of music has potency inplaces one might not begin to suspect. Taken on it's own,this is an excellent Donald Fagen album easily the equal,if sometimes very different,to his first three solo releases.places one might not begin to suspect.

0385344333|3.0|Good development for the characters with enough personal infromation so that I was able to have a good understanding and feeling for the characters.  The story was well described for the rural areas of KS, NE, IA and OK.<br /><br />The ending with the \\"fire fight\\" of simply killing the bad guys without a conclusion and Reacher \\"riding off into the sunset\\"  without a conclusion and or a purpose.  Many pages of intrest and then the ending was there and gone.<br /><br />Looks like Lee got tired and ended the book without much thought for the reader and or any \\"moral\\" to the story.

B0068THAGY|5.0|... SO glad I didn't!  The acting is superb, especially the kids... of course it had a taste of ET and The Goonies in there, which I loved as well.... The story line itself might as well be classified \\"martian\\" but it's a little aggravating you can never really see it - is that a spider or a ... uh... in any case, it kinda added to the appeal, LOL.<br /><br />Also, typically not a fan of watching things blow up but this had really believable effects, in my opinion, sparing me the stupid godawful computer animation so common today... It really was a tense film, a sweet little puppy love story, sadness of loss story and then, well, a bit of a monster movie.  And your kids can watch it since it's not gory... I'd say 11+.
B0058SN2C2|2.0|This was my first Crocs purchase and the style is adorable, the delivery time was impeccable, and this was the best price I'd found. However, two issues stood in the way of me loving these shoes (and I really wanted to!). The first issue that I came across is NOT related to the quality of the shoe, but I'm writing about it in case anyone else has the same problem. My left foot is slightly shorter than my right, not enough to wear a smaller size, but enough to be inconvenient. As a result, the back of the left shoe kept sliding off my heel. However, asymmetrical extremities are not the fault of the Crocs company, so that's unrelated to the 2/5 rating.<br /><br />My rating stems from the fact that by the end of the day, my little toes were rubbed completely raw. Although the shoes gave great support, they were too painful to keep. I'm super bummed because I'm a teacher and it's near impossible to find cute, comfortable, high quality, supportive shoes, all rolled into one.<br /><br />So, the search for the perfect work shoe continues:(

A two-man law firm whose specialty is ambulance chasing - they even have an office dog named \\"AC.\\" Then one evening a young lawyer (David Zinc) fed up with his position at a high-profile, work more hours than a day holds, beehive firm of drones, stumbles (yes, really) into their place of business, and announces that he wants to work for them. The guy must be nuts.<br /><br />Then they stumble into a sure thing (or so it appears). A huge pharmaceutical company may be selling a cholesterol drug that has the side effect of heart damage and death. What could be a quicker, easier road to riches? And so the romp begins. Romp, rout, whatever.<br /><br />At heart, David has the potential to be a good lawyer - not only in his legal abilities, but in his desire to achieve restitution for those who are wronged and have no capability to gain it for themselves. And David is the heart of the story. And his wife is a jewel.<br /><br />This is a rollicking, fun read, and Grisham must have enjoyed writing every word. Read this when you need a quick pick-me-up for your spirit.
B000MV8AE0|4.0|Hollywood often operates in pairs. Sometimes, it happens that two movies are released at substantially the same time, with the same subject matters, with only one inevitably overtaking the other, either in quality or popularity. For example: \\"The Player\\" and \\"The Mistress.\\" Both are movies about making movies, but the former the one most remembered. The Mistress is  arguably more edgier, and arguably a better reflection of the clash of egos involved in getting a movie financed, not to mention even made, but The Player is more remembered because it was considered the come-back movie of a respected director, Robert Altman.<br />Another good example are \\"Nowhere Boy\\" and \\"Backbeat,\\" two movies about the beginnings of the Beatles, both released about the same time. It seems Hollywood has trouble coming up with new ideas.<br /><br />So it is with this movie, \\"Copying Beethoven.\\" This movie was released at about the same time as \\"Immortal Beloved,\\" another movie about Beethoven, starring Gary Oldman in the title role. Is this any less of a movie? The approaches of the actors playing the title role are different. Oldman's portrayal is more impassioned, while Harris brilliantly conveys Beethoven's temper. There is nothing deficient in Harris' portrayal, but the movie suffers from a directorial approach which detracts the movie watcher's attention from the drama in Beethoven's life and could perhaps do with a better script. The music is there -- how could it not be? -- but the various subplots is confusing and distracting. At times, when watching Harris fly into one of the temper tantrums Beethoven was so famous for, one can't help but wonder what was in Harris' mind. He was probably thinking, \\"Why couldn't they come up with a decent script?\\"<br /><br />Beethoven wasn't just about temper tantrums, but had a life full of drama, remorse, and tragedy. It says a lot about Oldman's craft that he could portray these moods in a convincing way, such that even though he does not look like Beethoven, he IS Beethoven. While there is a superficial resemblance to the real person, no amount of make-up would make Harris' portrayal convincing because the script is too one-dimensional and the direction too confused.<br /><br />This is not a recommendation not to purchase this movie. If you have Immortal Beloved, buy this version of Beethoven's life to make your own comparison.like Beethoven, he IS Beethoven. While there is a superficial resemblance to the real person, no amount of make-up would make Harris' portrayal convincing because the script is too one-dimensional and the direction too confused.<br /><br />This is not a recommendation not to purchase this movie.

B007S3S8HO|3.0|What is not to be excited about? Angry birds - that ever addictive game that has our kids staring at a little glowing screen - finally being turned into a building toy. Yes!<br /><br />Well, not so fast. First of all the knex building sets are fun but they are not very sturdy where the connections are concerned. A little klutzy pressure on the wrong joint and the whole thing just crumples. The slingshot mechanism is cute but very frustrating if you are on the younger side or have small motor issues. The kit is vastly over priced considering it only contains 176 pieces.<br /><br />While intially fascinating and very exciting, the kit was abandoned quickly although the angry birds and pigs themselves are still very popular and have been recruited into other games. The K'nex bits, being of a standard size, have ended up in the bucket with all the other K'nex bits left over from the K'nex Mario and Luigi racers that we have. So, the best part of the kit is the birds and pigs themselves.

0812992792|5.0|Sometimes a novel catches me by surprise.  This is one.  All about the protagonist - Jun Do - a name not accidentally given as his true name and character are a mystery from beginning to end - a true John Doe.<br /><br />Written by a westerner, this book seeks to show the incredibly corrupt and unconventional world of cruelty and hate which censors a historically civil people.<br /><br />The leader, the brandish Kim Jong-il, has one-line quips in this novel which would make cartoon's Richie Rich seem like a rational and deserving youth whose good thoughts and nature uncompromisingly gave to others whenever called to action.  We know the former is not true, and in the silenced world of North Korea we can only speculate that the first is not true as well - it is the degree of egocentrism that we may never know.<br /><br />In the world of the \\"People's Republic\\", the Dear Leader's public persona is that of one whose only concern is  an unwavering, devoted and unrivaled love for his people - while the private person  sends those people to harvesting camps, work camps which rival Hitler's Germany, torture chambers similar to Stalin's Gulag, and poverty which is akin to the African continent.  And, while his people chow down on mouthfuls of sorghum, Kim Jong-il has his minister constantly order Cognac from France and other great luxuries for he and his cronies.<br /><br />The end is the beginning for anyone.  You may be lucky to reach the good graces of the Dear Leader, but odds are that you will eventually be another of his torture victims who is either imprisoned to inhumane camps or just to be beaten to a pulp while the people attempt to get one worthless morsel of confession. \\"Every karaoke singer must lose\\" comments one character.  All of the people -- good or bad --  seem to end in the camps.<br /><br />Insights abound in this novel.  The Korean meeting with the Americans in Texas is great - where their concept of eating barbecue is an insult as the Americans made them eat off paper plates, with their hands out in the open. Eating at the Senator's ranch was most insulting as they ate with animals - the worst being dogs which are outlawed in North Korea.  In America, the Koreans ponder why are dogs undeservedly given special foods, special doctors and beds in the home?  My favorite memory of this encounter is when the Dear Leader's posse quotes passages of Kim Jong-il's multi-volume treatise of almost any topic addressed by man in its history.  When the passages of such a tome are clearly plagiarism -- one recital of Jack Kennedy's \\"Ask not . . .\\", the American Senator then guesses that the Dear Leader also created Dicken's famous \\"I regret that I have but one life to give to my country\\" and saunters away.<br /><br />American or British literature are relevant to this novel.  The constant overlapping of Hollywood's classic [[ASIN:B001EBWING Casablanca]] both make this book have a western correlation, and make this novel extremely marketable to film producers.  This will be a movie - count on that.<br /><br />The main female character, Sun Moon (whose name is that of the recently deceased American minister), is perhaps the one character who publicly acts most like her inner self.  Everyone else must put on an act which will not incite the government and its enforcers - which ultimately (almost always) deliver such people to the tombs of the labor camps.  One such camp  is full of radioactive materials, a telling statement that the life there is not to last long.<br /><br />In the end, I feel like this fictional account delivered an authoritative representation of North Korean life.  And, that could probably be a mistake.  But, this author spent three years researching the relatively unknown country and gave us as accurate an account as the hidden nation could ever possibly permit.  Hence, my beliefs could be legitimate, even if the source is fiction.<br /><br />Reading this book will enhance one's perspective of what goes on inthis country of dark nights. And, with the Casablanca references, coupled with the great contrarian and other dialogue volleyed between the characters, this novel reads easily and quickly.  This is a winning novel by an author I intend to read in the future.this country of dark nights.

I was recently introduced to the goings on of the Crowley family and was so taken by the whole story that I ended up watching the entire first two seasons (every chance I could get) within a week. When I'm watching it, I forget that it's just a series for television. The quality feels like a blockbuster movie. Every last detail draws you in from the superb acting to the location's beauty and sullenness. Feels so realistic. If you are a fan of Historical Fiction such as Pride and Prejudice and the like, you will definitely want Downton Abbey to be your new TV addiction! Well done!

B004H4XI5O|3.0|The premise of [[ASIN:0143120530 Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything]] is intriguing. Joshua Foer, an out-of-work journalist, trains for a year at using mnemonic tricks to improve his short-term memory for digits, cards, trivia, and words. He is coached by Ben Pridmore, a Brit considered one of the world's best on the competitive memory circuit.<br /><br />Most memory gurus work at creating distinct images to go along with an array of data they want to store. In this manner, they marry the human brain's remarkable capacity for spatial memory with its inability to remember ordinary things for long. Each image (e.g. Rosanne Barr could represent the Queen of Spades) is stored in a 'memory palace', a physical space the person knows very well. This could be a childhood home, a building, and anywhere else that can be carpmentalized. The distinct image is mentally stored in a specific area of the memory palace. This serves to hold the piece of information in a way that is more easily retrieved than any other method.<br /><br />Take nothing away from Joshua Foer's prose, he writes directly and includes enough anecdotes and interviews to keep the narrative moving at a nice clip. The issue is that the story lacks action. Although Foer becomes adept at creating vivid images to aid in his memory, too little is offered to the reader in the way of drama. Many of the images Mr. Foer uses for his memory training are intentionally withheld from the reader because they are of a graphic nature (sexual imagery makes for longer-lasting memories). There is nothing exciting about a group of men thinking hard.<br /><br />Thus the reason mental athletes are so rarely featured on television. Their sport is horribly dull to watch for any amount of time. As challenging as it may be to memorize a deck of cards in under a minute, it pales when compared to watching soccer, basketball, or even a spelling bee.<br /><br />Foer makes excellent arguments that the stigma of memorization in the world of education has impaired our youth. A solid grounding in the facts allows for the possibility of deeper analysis in any subject. Most children today cannot remember important historical dates, the order of the presidents, or authors of significant English works--things that would have been routine in 19th century education.<br /><br />Moonwalking with Einstein is not a bad read, but neither is it recommended when there are so many other general interest works dealing with extraordinarily intelligent people. 3/5 stars.tigma of memorization in the world of education has impaired our youth.

But it is also well played and sung without making a fuss of comparing it to the die hard reference audio recordings such as Richter, etc., I have those. But life moves on that I need new experience in sight and sound if the performances are still strong enough.<br /><br />That said, I enjoy this blu-ray expecting repeated watching and listening.

B008XFAT7S|4.0|Movie goes, especially in America, are intensely over-stimulated.  Major movie producers crank out over-polished CGI \\"masterpieces\\" that are so shiny, they tend to blind you to the movie itself.  Every now and then, we all need some unexpected quantity to walk up behind us, tap us on the shoulder and sucker punch us to let us know that it is still possible to make a really good movie without all the excessive flash.  The Indonesian movie industry has done exactly that with \\"The Raid: Redemption.\\"<br /><br />This movie is expertly filmed with exquisite fight choreography and once the action starts, it almost never stops.  The plot is somewhat shallow and the characters are underdeveloped, but this does not exactly detract from the film.  In fact, it aids in it's enjoyment as it frees the viewer up to enjoy this movie for that it is:  an ultra-violent blood bath.  The Raid: Redemption is well worthy of being mentioned in the same sentence as such action movie classics such as Commando, Rambo: First Blood Part II, and the original Die Hard.<br /><br />This is an action movie.  If you're looking for an intricate plot or deep characters, then you don't really want to watch an action movie.  If you're looking for some of the most epic violence you've ever seen, then this movie delivers and then some.

B000174LVQ|5.0|Another masterpiece by virtuoso guitarist Paco de Luc&iacute;a. As far as I know, this is the last studio recording of Paco. If he closes his illustrious recording career with this jewel we can only be grateful. Nevertheless, I hope that Paco will soon surprises us with another work of art.  As it is typical of Paco de Luc&iacute;a's flamenco recordings, he explores different rhythms styles such as buler&iacute;as, rumbas and tangos, among others. All the rhythms are played gracefully by Paco maintaining a perfect balance between the rhythmic sections (specially hand clapping) and cantaores. In \\"Cositas Buenas\\" we can appreciate a very mature (musically speaking) Paco de Luc&iacute;a in which he allows cantaores to be protagonists as true flamenco should be. Track 7, in particular, is very special, since it makes us remember how extraordinary Camar&oacute;n de la Isla was. In contrast with Paco's previous masterwork, \\"Luzia\\", which feels very intimate, this recording is joyful and melancholic at the same time. It is refreshing.

1400069289|4.0|I bought this book just wanting to have a better understanding of habits.  Only three pages of this book talked about a woman who stopped her nail biting habit. Miraculously (to me) those few pages helped me stop biting my nails after 40 years of being a serious, habitual nail biter. I did not buy the book with nail biting in mind at all. I am still somewhat amazed that I was able to so easily change this habit after so many failed attempts over the years.

B000GGSM94|4.0|This is one of the better Cure record to explore a variety of sounds imo. You have a ton of stuff to go over here and the bonus disc is packed with some goodies and instrumentals. The hit Just Like Heaven is here but really the quality of the disc is mostly top notch. Songs like Icing Sugar, Like Cockatoos, How Beautiful You Are, Snakepit, and Why Can't I Be You show them at their most creative. The whole album is finally here to as opposed to the old CD which cut the last song and I think they did a nice job remastering for an audience both new and old. It's not too loud but they brought up the levels a bit and it sounds good with intact dynamics. I would say Disintegration, Bloodflowers, and Seventeen Seconds are indeed better off the top of my head but this one is up there with their good records. The recording quality itself isn't really the best imo but this one as always sounded that way.

0670023329|5.0|This is a remarkable book, for all the reasons that the reviewers preceding me have mentioned, and for at least two more reasons that carry their own weight.  Many journalists and authors have tried to peel back the layers of secrecy that cloak North Korea, and only a very few have been able to do so.  Blaine Harden's journalism is breathtakingly clear, rendering this true story in shattering detail. It's possible that Harden's rendering of conditions in North Korea is unparalleled, though the fictional rendering of modern North Korea in the spectacularly good Orphan Master's Son is a serious rival.<br /><br />Here's where I think the many detailed and positive reviews of Escape From Camp 14 miss the mark:  they don't go far enough, or deep enough.<br /><br />First, though the book is about the only person born in a North Korean prison camp known to have escaped, and about the nation that imprisoned him, in reality this is an ancient story about humankind itself.  Human history is a long and exceedingly bloody parade of regimes, temporal or religion based, that wreaked unimaginable, but (with good journalism)quite describable brutality on its citizens/adherents.  Escape from Camp 14 needs to be read with bifocals: the lower set of lenses directed at the microcosm of North Korea, and the upper set of lenses directed at our home planet.  Looking only through the lower lenses gives a terrific concentration of information about a tiny corner of the globe that is in deep distress, but it also invites the reader to think that cruelty and debasement is OVER THERE, no where close to where we live.  Looking through the upper lenses is an invitation to see what sorts of governments protect their citizens, what sorts of rights are necessary to prevent abuses, what sorts of checks and balances are needed to prevent too much power from falling into the hands of a few barbaric leaders.  To be briefer, if one reads this book with a tidy sense of \\"My, my! What evil! What depravity!  What a maniacal leader North Korea has!\\", then one is ignoring the hard work that needs to be done at all levels of society to prevent just such behavior.<br /><br />Secondly. in a striking display of journalistic integrity, Harden does not convert this book into the \\"Triumph of the Human Spirit\\" genre.  It is clear, if one reads the text carefully, that the horrendous external wounds of the protaganist, and their accompanying permanent scars, are no less present in his mind.  The protagonist (as well as the rare others that have lived to tell the tale of life in the North Korean prison camps) is emotionally crippled.  Here is what is important about that:  a large, consistent data base, using studies based on increasingly sophisticated imaging of the human brain, confirm that repeated traumatic experiences physically alter the brain.  Measurably, and permanently.  Cruelty and brutality quite literally cause brain damage.  The chld that is repeatedly sexually and/or physically abused can adapt somewhat, can certainly regain function, but never entirely recovers. Harden's unblinking description of the protagonist's slow and halting adaptations to freedom is far more honest than the romantic notion that freedom is a thorough panacea for all previous trauma.  As has been noted again and again, the life courses of children adopted from brutal orphanages (e.g. in Romania)are chaotic, the large majority of them permanently so.<br /><br />All to say:  Escape from Camp 14 is a call to action regarding human rights, a clarion call for governments based on a constitution that guarantees those rights, and clear demonstration of the need for legal systems robust enough to make rule of law stick.  Failure to respond to this invitation simply guarantees that other journalists, in other times, will document with equally excruciating detail, human abuse and brutality that will, as does Escape From Camp 14 make us blanch with horror.What a maniacal leader North Korea has!\\", then one is ignoring the hard work that needs to be done at all levels of society to prevent just such behavior.<br /><br />Secondly. in a striking display of journalistic integrity, Harden does not convert this book into the \\"Triumph of the Human Spirit\\" genre.

B008D19WBQ|1.0|FIVE STARS for the show, but one star for Warner Bros.'s ridiculous (greedy?) decision to release the broadcast/shorter versions.<br /><br />Since I too am very disappointed but still interested in having an HD version at my disposal, I wanted to point out to my fellow fans, the Region-Free Blu-ray is much cheaper. The French Amazon site at Amazon DOT fr has it WITH shipping (to New York) for $111, and the UK Amazon site at amazon DOT co DOT uk has it for $129 including shipping. (Of course, replace the DOTs with actual periods.)<br /><br />Both boxed sets are in English. The UK version has many more language and subtitle options. Note that it comes in a very different box with different art, and I'm sure you'll have to wait a week for shipping, but hey, save almost a hundred bucks, right?<br /><br />Forgive the formatting of this post. Amazon tends to edit out links and any text that has to do with currency. Cheers to all my fellow FRIENDS fans, and here's to hoping we get a full release some time soon.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|After anxiously awaiting the follow up to Bared to You - which I loved, I was disappointed in Reflected in You.<br />The Positives:<br />-This book, unlike the first in the series, felt less like FSOG. The characters developed their own story.<br />-The sex was hot but the limo scene got a little graphic.<br /><br />The Negatives:<br />-Can you say dysfunctunal??? It was hard to root for their relationship knowing that Gideon and Eva are hugely dysfunctional together.<br />-Gideon's inability to open up to Eva was frustrating and it made him less likeable as a character. I didn't trust him or feel that he deserved her considering how he treated her through most of the book.<br />-Similarly, Eva made some immature and detrimental decisions as well which only further added to their dysfunction.<br />- The reappearance of Nathan (Eva's abuser) had so much potential as a story line but the way it was handled in the background of the story was disappointing. Because the reader did not learn anything new about Nathan, it was hard to understand and accept Gabriel's reaction to him.<br /><br />I'm sure I'll read Book 3 in the series since I am already this far invested in it. Hopefully, Ms. Day will give me reason to want a happy ending for these two characters.

1451627289|5.0|November 22nd, 1963, the day JFK was shot in Dallas Texas.  Stephen King writes the what if book.  What if you could go back and change the past?  How would it effect the present?<br /><br />Thirty-five year old English teacher, Jake Epping is told of a portal that will take him back to 1958.  Al, who owns the diner where the portal is, enlists Jake to return to 1958 and change the assassination of JFK.  So Jake returns to 1958 and becomes George Amberson, the man who stops the assassination of JFK.<br /><br />This is my very first Stephen King novel and was suggested to me by a librarian friend.  Seven hundred pages later I am hooked and will be checking out other Stephen King novels.<br /><br />Jake Epping, the lead character, is an incredible character.  Real, down to earth, loving, and so strong in his beliefs are words I would use to describe Jake.  You could not help but totally believe that he was going back in time and trying to make life so much better for his friends and co-workers.  My favorite part of this story has to be Jake, AKA George, falling in love in the past and trying to make Sadie's life better with promises of the present (2011).<br /><br />When I started this novel I was very unsure about the author and the subject.  I would say sci-fi, historical, maybe a lil chic-lit (due to the romance) would describe this story.  Now that I finished 11/22/63 I cannot help but keeping thinking about it and wishing there was more to come.  Every chapter pulled me in deeper and deeper.  Whether you are a true Stephen King fan or this is your first book of his, you will love this story.  It has something for everyone.

1594203059|4.0|Niall Ferguson believes in the superiority and the usefulness of Western Civilization. Western Civilization has offered human societies the best available combination of economic, social and political institutions. The power of Civilization has also created the sanctity of individual freedom and the security of private property rights, ensured by representative, constitutional government. However, he says, Civilization collapse quite abruptly after functioning in apparent equilibrium for some unknowable period. The biggest threat to Western Civilization is caused not by other civilizations, but by our own pusillanimity. The ultimate threat comes from lack of understanding of, and faith in, Civilization as our own cultural heritage. Seeing times of tribulation to Western Civilization, he asserts the text are taught in its schools, learned by its students and should be recollected.<br /><br />His explanation along with six aspects of Civilization is right off the reel and easy to understand. Together with IT words like six killer applications, launch-pad, download, iGod, he inlays here and there witty phrases such as the mission civilisatrice, lay down its arms and pick up its shopping bags, in full swing in two broad band, more grist for the movie mills, the jean genie was out of the curved glass bottle of Coca-Cola and tanks had to take precedence over tank-tops, etc. This writing method helps to ease a history book into a historical story. Ferguson's knowledge is vast and profound. I learned the derivation of not only words like denim and jeans but also a Japanese word SEBIRO, to say nothing of the origin of Civilization.<br /><br />He explains denim pants and vinyl discs as among the most success products of capitalism and movies and marketing as industries coming out well. A bit suspicion remained unsolved to me of a vinyl freak and movie fan. What can Civilization do with the inherent culture to each nation. Is it meaningful to find a synergy way with the characteristic culture on the way of pursuing Civilization. Every developing countries dream of being Asian tigers and African lions someday. They eagerly desire to establish democratic societies guarded by fair and square laws for the prosperity of their nations. In order to attain Western Civilization, do they need even to take off their cultural heritage. Facing reactionary movement especially from the Islamic worlds, the author acknowledges the retail therapy would not be an only answer. I would like to know his thoughts by digging further into this problem in his next work.teristic culture on the way of pursuing Civilization.

B009IU6N5Y|1.0|I read the book on a friend's recommendation and was pleasantlt surprised at how well executed this little piece of alternate history/fantasy/horror fiction was.  Someday, someone will have to explain to me why filmmakers insist on taking a perfectly well written story and totally ignoring it while adapting it to the screen.  After the movie was over, I was convinced that I had read and watched two totally different stories.<br />On the movie's merits alone, the plot was uneven (mind numbingly slow at some parts, too quick at others), the actual dialogue was crap made crappier by poor acting and worse directing, the action scenes were boring, including the big action scene toward the end which my friend had to nudge me awake to witness, then fell back to dozing until the end credits.<br />Complete failure as a movie.

140053271X|3.0|I don't read a ton so I didn't want to pay a huge premium for an e-reader.  I have an iPad but when I do read, sometimes staring at that screen for more than an hour can give me a headache.  It came down to this, the basic Kindle, and the new Kindle Paperwhite.  When I really thought about it, the Paperwhite was more than I really wanted to spend on something I would only use an hour or 2 a week.  I ultimately decided to get this because it could read epub files natively and didn't have to be converted to MOBI files which the Kindle uses.<br /><br />It wasn't quite as straight forward as I was expecting.  I initially thought it'd be like the iPad where you just drag the book into the Books section of iTunes and you're ready to go.  I dragged the books onto the Nook when it appeared on my desktop and nothing happened.  I found out you had to download ADE and set it up that way.  From there you have to add the books to ADE then add them to your Nook, not a huge deal, but a few extra steps compared to the iPad.<br /><br />I also noticed that scrolling between pages had a bit of delay compared to the iPad and that when you were trying to use the scroll bar to advance more than a few pages at a time, it wasn't the most accurate.  It also appears that page sync only works with content you purchase from them and not files you have already on your computer(I think the Kindle is the same way as well though).<br /><br />The reading experience is great though.  Its not too bright and easy on the eyes.  The Nook itself is pretty light so its not a hassle to hold it for awhile.  Library is also easy to scroll through once its on your device.<br /><br />Overall I am happy with it.  I mentioned its shortcomings, but they don't outweigh how easy it is to read and the overall reading experience.  From a reading standpoint I'd give it 5 stars, just some other things that popped up that aren't big deals, but noticable.  I'd recommend this to anyone like myself who doesn't do a ton ofreading, but still wants a simple e-reader.  If you are a more serious reader, I'd probably spring for the Paperwhite.
0307960471|5.0|I am quite simply and unabashedly addicted to Jo Nesbo's Harry Hole books, a series chronicling the worst luck of the hard luck notorious (former) cop. Available due in great part to the translations of Don Bartlett, who makes sure that nothing is lost in doing so, English readers have been able to avail themselves of one of the finest set of crime fiction works available in any language, one in which each successive volume tops its predecessor. PHANTOM, Jo Nesbo's latest offering, is no exception; it is his most challenging and complex work to date, a novel that brings Harry so close to his own heart of darkness that it is at times painful to read yet compels one to do so, and as quickly as possible.<br /><br />PHANTOM finds Harry returning to Oslo from Hong Kong, taking a respite from his perfectly legal yet somewhat morally dodgy new occupation to attempt to put things right in his former home. Harry's stepson Oleg, now 18, has been arrested for the murder of Gusto, a teenage junkie with whom Oleg had gone into partnership. Oleg is almost certainly the doer of the crime and, despite facing a lifetime of incarceration, seems disinclined to putting on any sort of defense. Harry has no clout, being on the police force, yet through a series of connections, old chits and outright blackmail, manages to cobble together an investigation even as his presence and poking about makes him a target for a crime syndicate as well. The main narrative is occasionally the object of an interlude from the dead Oleg, who, in his final moments, describes the events that lead up to his lonely death, bleeding out in a trashed room, with only a rat for witness and company.<br /><br />The book's driving force is drugs, or, more specifically, a new designer street drug known as violin, for reasons that become known before the book's halfway point. It is impossible to read even a page or two, from beginning to end, without Thomas Wolfe's famous phrase \\"Oh lost!\\" coming to mind. Whether or not Oleg is innocent of Gusto's murder ultimately is beside the point, as it becomes increasingly obvious that Oleg is involved in some very, very bad things. Harry's recognition of this is one of the most poignant episodes in PHANTOM (or any book, for that matter) that you are likely to read this year, all the more so for its understated presentation.<br /><br />Along the way, Nesbo presents a series of supporting characters old and new who are just as interesting, if not more so, than the story itself. Harry and Rakel, his former lover, are reunited again by necessity, and take tentative steps toward rekindling their relationship. In the meantime, Harry forms an odd and dysfunctional but somewhat effective alliance with Simonsen, Rikel's new boyfriend and Oleg's attorney, as both men try pushing water uphill in an attempt to exonerate the young man. There is also Cato, an extremely creepy street priest who resides in the respectful nooner hotel where Harry has taken temporary lodging, a bunch of cops who are bent to varying degrees, and a very, very bad group of Russian thugs. Each and all are involved as the sleek chassis of the plot heads toward the precipice of its climax; the answer to who is driving, who is pushing, and who will go over the edge by story's end will keep you up reading for at least one night, maybe two.<br /><br />Comparisons of PHANTOM with \\"Breaking Bad\\" are inevitable but simplistic, though both share the overall subject matter of drugs as well as an occasional gloriously dark humor. However, there are more differences than similarities between the two, and each can be enjoyed on its own terms. As far as PHANTOM is concerned, the haunting ending will leave new and old readers alike hungry for the next installment. If you don't read another book this year, please read this one.<br /><br />Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub

0812992784|5.0|It was on Valentine's Day in 1989 that Salman Rushdie awakened to a phone call from a BBC reporter who asked him how it felt to be sentenced to a Fatwah by the Ayatollah Khomeini. He, growing up in the Muslim culture, had never heard that word nor had the rest of the Western world. He soon learned that it means an irrevocable death sentence that lasts through eternity as he was notified that the London police were stepping in to protect him and his family. He is advised to either go into witness protection or adopt a pseudonym and live with around-the-clock protection by a team from the Special Branch of MI5 Believing the situation will be short term, he opts for the latter and chooses as an alias Joseph Anton, derived from the first names of two favorite authors: Joseph (Conrad) and Anton (Chekhov).<br /><br />His life becomes one of a celebrity/fugitive as he is \\"allowed\\" --- a term he soon grows to detest --- to be driven only in bulletproof cars by threatening-looking armed drivers and to live around the clock with no fewer than two beefy, armed but amiable members of his select protection team in his residence. His mail is delivered by courier only after being cleared by authorities looking for incendiary devices. He and his family are often forced to scuttle for cover to hastily arranged bolt holes as threat levels rise or fall. Any time MI5 learns of a new bounty on his head --- as much as $1 million or, once, a 100,000-man mob in Tehran, each vouching to sell a kidney to raise money for his death, or suspicion that his current location has been blown, often requiring departure in a matter of minutes. What he thought would be a relatively brief period of inconvenience turns into an 11-year nightmare. It destroys two marriages and a few friendships, although it is through the world of writers that he finds his greatest friends. He refuses to recant or apologize, which costs him and the British government millions of pounds.<br /><br />The book begins with an introduction to Salman Rushdie, the Bombay Indian boy raised in Pakistan in a non-practicing Muslim family who becomes an award-winning novelist and writes a somewhat whimsical book about how Islam was created, never knowing the furies it will unleash. THE SATANIC VERSES so inflames the Muslim world even as most of his detractors never read the book, including the madman who sentenced him to death.  He concludes the brief autobiographical sketch with this statement as the book goes public: \\"Throughout the writing of THE SATANIC VERSES...a note to himself (was) pinned to the wall above his desk. 'To write a book is to make a Faustian contract in reverse,' it said. `To gain immortality or at least posterity, you lose, or at least ruin, your actual daily life.'\\"  This memo would prove profoundly prophetic --- an irony in itself, as he later states that he has had quite enough of prophets in his lifetime.<br /><br />JOSEPH ANTON evolves into a sometimes terrifying, occasionally Keystone Cops chronicle. He describes as preposterous his first visit to New York as riding in a seven-car cavalcade complete with sirens and motorcycle outriders to pick up a writing award. Later he finds the only peaceful respite from the intense security is on United States soil as he and his family seek refuge in rented homes of friends.<br /><br />1989 was the year of Tiananmen Square, the tearing down of the Berlin Wall, and the end of the Cold War. George HW Bush was inaugurated, and Margaret Thatcher ruled in the UK. The Berlin Wall came down and the Cold War ended. It was the end of one era and the beginning of another.<br /><br />Rushdie, a master of the metaphor, borrows from the opening scene of the Alfred Hitchcock thriller The Birds. He likens the advent of world terror to the first blackbird. One bird appears as a personal messenger on the climbing frame outside a school, joined by a few more, then tens of thousands fill the sky to devour the world. Religious intolerance on a world-wide scale arrived as a single condemnation of a writer who dared to speak plainly. He compares the Fatwah to a harbinger of what was to come by the turn of the century as the black cloud hovered over the twin towers of the World Trade Center.<br /><br />Rushdie says, \\"As to the battle over THE SATANIC VERSES,it is still hard to say if it was ending in victory or defeat. The book was not suppressed, nor was its author, but the dead remained dead, and a climate of fear had grown up that made it harder for books like his to be published, or even, perhaps to be written.\\"<br /><br />Powerful and thought-provoking, JOSEPH ANTON celebrates the First Amendment and a devotee's determination that censorship will neither crush nor kill him or his family. Thus is the life of a novelist who unintentionally gains notoriety as he lives or attempts to live in a world where state-sponsored terrorism continues to clash with the innate human desire for freedom. Meanwhile, the Arab Spring has spread across the Middle East, raising the hope for freedom among repressed peoples. Sadly, current events find a brave Pakistani girl near death because she dared to write a blog about educating young girls. She is the victim of a Taliban assassination attempt as her would-be killer vows to finish what he began.<br /><br />Reviewed by Roz Shea

I was willing to look past the bland cover but the songs only continue the cover's vibe.  Gene really needs help with his lyrics because they're atrocious (again). One star and I'm being very generous, it should get a zero.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Good stuff. Much more variety than I expected from the title track, which is good in its own right. Admirtedly I found this band first on guitar hero, but the rest of their songs were better than expected.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Another whirl wind adventure with Katniss Peetra and Gale very interested in seeing how it turns out in District 13
B007SGM084|5.0|This is more than kinky sex. It is a love story and a story about discovery. I started reading it just to see what all the hype was about and could not put it down.  You get invested in the characters and want to see where their journey takes them. A great story!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I &lt;3 pinterest. this app is glitchty for Kindle Fire... However since everything is glitchty for the Kindle Fire I won't hold that against it!
B005SMGRH0|5.0|A good CD and DVD compiling the best hits of Gorillaz in last 10 years in a chronological way. Good to have if you want to know what is Gorillaz about or if you are a fan how wants the best in a CD/DVD.
1469984202|5.0|Like many of the other reviewers here, I am a long time science fiction fan and a voracious reader.  I found these stories thoughtful, well written, insightful and captivating.  I read through the entire thing in a couple of days and would have kept going if there was any more.  The kind of vivid and powerful storytelling that still has you thinking about it in the shower the day after you've finished reading.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|nice pleasant game.  relaxing and yet a little challenge to it.  Time passes quickly and you do not even notice.
B0086700CM|4.0|it is awesome at first but when you get far it gets harder and harder but all in all its pretty fun!
B000N4SHPS|4.0|We are a fan of the Rocky movies and we thought it was really good and had a good story line but it took a while to hook us into the climax. But overall a good movie!
B009QW6ZT8|5.0|Not much to add, just want to +1 what everyone else has said.  Great way to kick off the season.  Acting actually seems stronger in this episode--Lori has a great moment.  Relationships are changing.  Carl actually didn't annoy me.
B004ZQ74G8|3.0|Given the reviews I had read, I was expecting better, which was maybe it's downfall. It was too childish, even from the perspective of a five year old for me. The oven never had a 'tummy' when I was five, it was just an oven. I didn't find the story enlightening or thought provoking and it seemed to end as lackluster as it started.<br /><br />Short enough to be worth reading, but definitely not one of my favorites.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Finally a great tool for organizing and sharing my notes, todo's, pictures, etc.  The function of having several notebooks helps me keep my notes neat and in order.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|The end segment for each phase could be better, but overall the game is pretty good. I would also like to see a way to turn off the voice without skipping the segments.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Super addictive. You can really lose track of time with this game! I will be purchasing the app soon in no time!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|the game is fun. has a new twist on a familiar game. not too complecated for even the youngest of gamers
B001NLKT60|4.0|I couldn't put the book down.  In this book you find out so much about Lisbeth and her past.  Throughout the whole book there are little revelations.  I liked how you found things out during the entire book instead of finding out just at the end.  Can't wait to read the last one.
1452110581|5.0|read this little book and it was pure funny, gave it to my husband to read and he laughed pretty hard..my son is reading it now..think I have a sticking stuffer gift lined up!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show and Season 2 was no exception!  I can't wait for future seasons to be released on DVD.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|this is a good addictive game with great graphics only down is no volumecadjustment okay I having fun try it
B006H5120E|5.0|Excellent service and great quality on the 3d version of the film. 3d of this film makes it seem like you are a part of the movie.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This movie was amazing.  I loved it and would stongly recommend it. Josh did a great job with this.  I cant wait for the next to come out!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Lots of twists and turns. Requires a decent brain to complete. Hours of fun. Loved the hidden object searches, too.
3836527286|5.0|A wonderful coffee table book and one to treasure. I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. A big classy book with beautiful photos.
B008EEWN6I|4.0|I will most likely edit this review as I just watched the Harakiri music video.  I may be a Deathcore, Death Metal, Metalcore, Black Metal, Melodic Death Metal fan; but I absolutely loved the video and will have to give this album a listening to.  I love Serj's voice, he an amazing vocalist, and I am very excited to hear the rest of this album!!
B004IYISSK|5.0|This book was well written and seemed to come straight from the author's heart.  I read this book because I loved the movie and have decided that I now love them both.  I very much related to the struggles the main characters had in  their intergenerational relationships and dealing with a mom or in my case, grandma who comes from a different place and time.  For these characters, it was pre-WWII China, for me it was Depression Era south.  The point is that all mothers and daughters find themselves having to find new ways to relate to each other as time and their lives change.  The way you relate to your mother as a child is vastly different from a teenager, from a young adult and then as a mother yourself.  The story telling and characters are very rich and makes you feel that you're getting to know these people.  You care about their struggles and understand their feelings.
0060873175|3.0|I read this book since my brother recommended it to me, otherwise I would probably have stayed away after reading the description. I'm not really into being chased and eaten by giant bugs. But I gave it a go and honestly couldn't put it down once I got started. While the plot and characters were a bit predictable (typical Jurassic Park like formula) and the science in the book is obviously all fantasy and can't be taken seriously, the descriptions of the scenery and life in the micro world is fascinating. Or horrifying. Either way, it's hard to get some of the images out of my head.
B008UTV6S8|5.0|Let me get this out of the way. First of all anyone with any musical sensibility will tell you that as songwriters Bruce Springsteen and Billy Joel combined can't carry Paul Simon's jock strap. Neither has written even one song that can remotely compare to say \\"The Boxer\\", \\"American Tune\\", \\"Bridge Over Troubled Waters\\" or \\"Still Crazy After All These Years\\". If it's ear shattering mindless volume you're after then Mr Simon can't compete with the Boss. If you're looking for simple catchy melodies like \\"Just The Way You Are\\" or \\"Uptown Girl\\" than Billy will probably get your vote. But if you watch or just listen to this tour de force performance by Mr Simon and his virtuoso bandmates you'll soon realize just how one dimensional Mr Springsteen and Mr Joel are. Over the years I've collected two dozen or more concert DVD's. Some like \\"Ladies and Gentlemen The Rolling Stones\\" and \\"Astral Weeks Live at Hollywood Bowl\\" are wonderful and very entertaining. But even these, I find go on the shelf after three or more viewings. Not so with \\"Live in New York City\\". I've watched it ten or more times already and I know I'll be going back to it at least ten times more. Just check out how multi-talented these musicians are, each plays two or three different instruments. Listen to how seamlessly they go from genre to genre, (jazz, zydeco, african, Latin, etc). With every viewing of this wonderful collection, I keep saying to myself over and over again...Boy I wish I had seen this show live. Well at least I've got the DVD and I guess that's the next best thing.
0307950689|3.0|This is the first Dan Brown book I've read and I admit I had high expectations when I started, after hearing all the hype. The flow of the book was okay- the flashbacks seemed to happen at the most inconvenient moments and I often found myself checking to see how many pages to go until the action picks back up. The writing was also very repetitive, which I found annoying as it's really not difficult to look in a thesaurus if you can't think of any other words to use. Wouldn't an editor notice that flaw? I also found the main character, Robert Langdon, rather weak. He actually did a whole lot of nothing in the entire book. Everyone else did all the thinking and the work and he was just kind of along for the ride, shrugging his shoulders.<br />Also, if the ending wasn't anti-climatic, I don't know what is. It was rather unsatisfying.<br />However, if you switch your brain off and don't give it too much thought it does have some entertainment value.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|similar to other jewels type puzzle games.  I like the little mythos history. of course not historically accurate but still fun.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I love this show and I received it before the time it was supposed to be sent. Can't wait to buy season 8.
B004LROMSY|1.0|I liked this but wasn't there only one season. If I remember right, they cancelled and left us hanging. I don't think I want to buy the DVD and go through that again.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|Had heard a lot about the movie and was eagerly waiting for it. I think the movie lived upto the expectations.
B008NW67E0|1.0|Mumford and sons continues to show the world how it's possible for talentless musicians to make an album. Anyone who wastes time listening to this needs a reality check.
B0001L3LUE|4.0|Although I was never \\"in country,\\" I was in the USN during the Viet Nam Conflict.<br />I made two cruises to the  South China Sea aboard the USS Ranger CVA-61, Aircraft Carrier.<br />I also had friends that were killed and friends that were injured in Viet Nam.<br />If you are willing to know the truth about war, including Viet Nam, watch this.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|The graphics are awesome, the game plays smoothly and is very engaging...it's hard to want to take a break!  Don't start if you don't intend to finish--you won't be able to put it down!
B005WUHAX8|3.0|I thought the case was pretty however I could not get it to fit tight on my phone and since part of the draw for life proof is being water resistant, I could not see how it could keep water out if case did not fit well.  I am sending it back.<br />Company did give me good service and delivered quickly at reasonable cost.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Nice looking graphics and good sound make this a surprisingly relaxing version of a match three game.  Challenging obstacles and the usual power-ups are laid into a story line that makes play compelling.  as faotd, price was shown as $4.99, that seems a couple bucks high, but without shady permissions, this would be a great deal at $1.99.  and seems to still be free, what are you waiting for?
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love these books. They are erotic-passion-desire and the ultimate love story. They are about the results of a neglected abused child whom has started to rise above the affects this has had as an adult. The affect that love and one person can change someones destiny! Yes a bit too kinky for most..but consensual none the less. It's about a lifestyle choice. A fear overcome. I can't wait to read the last book!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I fell in love with the Percy Jackson series a few years ago and of course, I love the Heroes of Olympus series just as much, if not more!<br />I loved how the story telling shifted between the characters, I kind of wish we would have heard more from Frank though; next to Percy, he's one of my favorites! Also, I wish we would have gotten more information about the Romans going after Camp Halfblood.<br />Other than that, I was completely sucked into the book from the beginning and I will be impatiently awaiting the next book!
B005LAIGP0|5.0|If you like the old fashion jump out and scare the bejeeesus ought of ya kinda movie, this is it! You think your one step ahead and then bam you get gobsmacked and nearly come flying out of your chair. I can't remember the last time a movie has scared me like this one. The end was brilliant and poignant and I highly recommend this movie to those who have tired of slashers, chainsaws and special effects.
B008XG1X18|5.0|i absolutely love this! i am addicted to it. it works amazing and is super fast. the only bad thinb iz it sometimes freezes up
B008ACC9CM|5.0|If you have never heard Jonathan and Charlotte sing you are in for the treat of a lifetime when you do.  First of all Jonathan has to be the greatest tenor of all time, and I say that with my fulllest convition, but paired together with his friend Charlotte, a singing sensation in her own right, the pair will literally blow your socks off.  Add to that the fact that ages of this pair is only 17 and you have a treat that will thrill you for ages.  Their combination of pop and opera may seem odd, but once you hear it you will be hooked just a millions of fans all over the world have become.  I cannot praise this pair highly enough. If you only buy one CD this year, this should be the one.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|Works ok but not totally accurate, good enough for free and choice of widget sizes is nice. Try it out.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this book. Great sequel, I couldn't put it down. It was moving, I felt for the characters and was immersed in their world.
B004LWZWGA|1.0|As I was at the movie, sitting through this awful third sequel of the Batman franchise, I began to wonder: \\" Am I the only one here who hasn't taken stupid pills\\"?. I mean, this movie is obviously so wrong and yet nobody seems to care. How comes that Batman who was conceived as the combination of such characters as Dracula, The Shadow, and Sherlock Holmes in this movie seems to have lost to all the characteristics of his inspirers?! If you know these characters well, you know what I mean!<br /><br />Also, More importantly,the movie is full of plot holes and the script is badly written. After half an hour, I got to the point I was wondering if there was a story at all. It was almost like watching Independence day meets Superman.<br /><br />Absolutely stupid!
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I am a action adventure movie kind of guy, as well as my son (single parent). I go to the movies or certain TV shows as a kind of escape.  I like to indulge in these movies like a rollercoaster ride....take me away! This movie is super fun, plenty of action and smart remark comments that tickles the funny bone. I have to admit that \\"Avengers\\" is my new (FAV.)top pick Action/Adventure movie. - got the two(2)pack combo Blu-ray disc! It's that awesome. Entertaining, not many movie I'd watch more than a couple of times. Avengers I can actually watch anytime I need a shot of movie adrenaline. Simply, \\"Beast\\" as my son would say!
B00005QGAZ|2.0|Be not duped by the excessive flim flam surrounding this mediocre and now very dated album touting it as ohhh \\"AMAZING\\" \\"GROUNDBREAKING\\" \\"A MUSICAL MASTERPIECE\\" \\"THE GREATEST ALBUM OF ALL TIME\\" \\"CHANGED THE COURSE OF MUSIC HISTORY\\", .. for I can assure you that it is, and was, truly nothing that extraordinary.<br /><br />There was nothing amazingly original or grounbreaking at all about the music on this album, not today nor even back when it came out. It was nothing but typical disco, funk and pop music, .. . stuff that had been done to death by a hundred musical acts before and was even already \\"old hat\\", conventional and supposed to be \\"dead\\" in the post punk & new wave early 80's when this album came along.<br /><br />This is quite simply typical 80's DANCIN music. The kind of stuff that people could \\"Get DOWN, moove, groove, and shake their booties to!  WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!\\" , .. THAT was the actual appeal of this album and the true reason it was bought by a bazillion people back in 1983/4. And if you want THAT kind of music, then this album will probably still work for THAT particular purpose. But a \\"groundbreaking musical masterpiece\\" ( ??? ), . .. sure, my rump !
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|There is nothing I would change about this book. It has filled me with an amazing sense of action, comedy, and romance. I loved it.
B00910Y1OQ|1.0|How is it listed under free games, yet still says $4.99? I want the game but don't think I am going to pay for it when it's listed under the free apps. It doesn't make much sense to me.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|ADDICTIVE!<br />Can't put it down. It's very fun to play.<br />It has a very good story line. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys matching/puzzle games.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|Any similarity between reality and this book is accidental. I feel intellectually diminished by having actually read it and wasting<br /> my time.l
B007K3JCAE|3.0|This was entertaining, but having high expectations set by the first movie, this one was a bit disappointing.  The acting was still as good as ever, but the plot just was a bit over the top in that it seemed that the director wanted to top everything that went on in the first movie.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This game makes align 3 refreshing and fun. the Powerups are powerful, but go hand in hand with the challenging levels.  I've yet to finish, but it is certainly addictive. not sure how much replay value there is in comparison to other align 3 games or if it is worth the price (I got it free),  but it is certainly well made.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I am new to the ESV Study Bible, but am enjoying it thoroughly. I also have the new 2011 NIV Study Bible for cross reference. NIV took a new path from its earlier 1984 version. The important thing to remember, although 2011 may be uncomfortable to some, is the ability for the bible to lead many to Christ; \\"which is what we know the 2011's ultimate objective is.\\" The ESV is closer to word for word; whereas the NIV, both revisions, is more thought for thought. Having a cross reference will keep me/us in both versions and give me/us the hope of becoming (a) better Christian/s. I would say the ESV would be more for the mature Christian who is searching for a more literal translation.<br /><br />God bless, \\"and keep reading!\\"
0399157565|5.0|Cornwell creates a world you simply will not want to leave in \\"The Bone Bed\\". This adventure takes Kay to places far and near, beginning with an extremely upsetting and perplexing<br />video that has Kay and her niece Lucy puzzled. As the story unfolds, you may ask yourself what on earth could a billionaire accused of murder, a temporary, self-destructing email account and a leatherback turtle have in common? And Marino on Twitter? This book really covers a lot of ground, and once you reach the end, you'll be sorry you're finished. I loved every bit of it, and was delighted to see the whole crew back in business with Kay. I highly recommend this book whether or not you've read any of the others and hope the publisher continues to distribute advanced readers copies since I loved reading it just before it was commercially available.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Fast paced, great read! couldnt put this book down.<br />Will definitely look for more from this author. highly recd this bk.
0525952926|1.0|I've read most of Follett's works before, from \\"Night Over Water\\" to \\"Eye of the Needle\\" to this one.<br /><br />This work is inferior in every way. I kept reading with the expectation that it would get better; it didn't.<br /><br />The characterization is dull; the dialogue is stilted. The writing was also horrible; most of the stories I read in college fiction writing classes feature way better writing.<br /><br />I do not think this would have been published if not for Follett's name. I really am struggling to comprehend how this book received such high ratings when it is probably the WORST book (by far) that he has ever written.
B003Y5H574|5.0|Am a movie junkie and I fell in love with this movie the firts time I watched it! Gosling is breath taking, Carrell is hilarious! A must have in your movie collection!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|love it.  the music is great as well. wish they had more free games from them. 5 stars! try it.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|It has a lot of twist and turns, so if you are like myself and can usually figure stories out before the end, you will not with this one.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|The graphics on this game are terrific however, for those of us who suffer from bad eyesight, the tiles should be made just a bit bigger.
B001F6TXME|5.0|Does exactly what I wanted and needed and is easy to use. Plug it in, turn on the camera and go. Replaces the onboard shutter button. Hold down half way to focus then press the rest of the way to take the picture. The trigger settings do not need to be set for each shot like a wireless remote. Once the button is pressed down you can also slide it forward to lock it open for extented exposure shots. It has done wonders for the sharpness of my photos because now I am not touching the camera when it fires. The cord is only about 3 feet long but that is perfect for me.
B000ZMCVRI|5.0|Great jams from a true legend. The title of album says it all. All songs are good quality and well worth it.
B000ELJBAA|5.0|If you want to get a David Gilmour solo album this is the one to get.  It has great songs, great guitar playing and is not boring like his other 2 solo albums.  Highly recommended!
0345803485|3.0|this book has everything i hate in a work of \\"literature\\" but i will be damned if i don't finish the trilogy. somewhere my professors are weeping.
B000ELJBAK|2.0|This is a huge disappointment.  Every song goes absolutley nowhere.  David sounds like he is just learning how to write songs (where is the melody??) and what is here is very empty and meandering.  Some of the guitar playing is good but overall there is not one good song or melody here.  Skip this and get his 2nd solo album About Face which is excellent!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I bought this book for my husband's Kindle and he read it in less than a week.  He said that it was a great read.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|As a Ken Follett fan, I have anxiously awaited for Winter of the World to be released.  All of his novels are incredibly well written, and the character development throughout them is astonishing as one follows their introduction and evolution.  Having read all of his works, I can honestly say this is his best....and I loved Pillars of the Earth. Follett's ability to closely parallel historical events with his characters and interlink them with each other keeps the reader closely involved as they live through the great wars of this century. A must read....
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It passes the time, until you are out of coins. It still is better than playing the real quarter game and being broke.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I enjoy the stories and all the details. even a child can play and understand the object of the game.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|What a delightful book.  I wasn't prepared to be as caught up in the book as I was.  The book is a series of letters written between several people, what could be more boring than reading someones mail.  How wrong I was.  Once you start reading it you can't put it down.  Highly recommended reading.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love these characters,story line,dream like ,reality all written in a way that has kept me up this evening to finish
B002XZNHG4|5.0|Until I rented \\"Annie Hall,\\" I'd seen it just once, when it was first released in movie theaters.  It's still hilarious.  Still poignant.  Still a memorable exploration of female/male relationships and the culture clash of Midwestern/Manhattan sensibilities.  It's Diane Keaton at her absolute best.  It's Woody Allen when his neurotic revelations were fresh and still entertaining.  In my mind, it's a member of the \\"Classics Hall of Fame.\\"
B007TNS6JI|1.0|loved the game but after having to start from scratch 3 times I got sick of it. It kept deleting everything.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|I especially enjoyed the author's humorous style of writing.  The story line was good but I got a little tired of the main character's smart mouth after a while.
0439023513|5.0|I loved this book. I thought the ending was realistic. I don't know why people hated it. Its not your typical love story ending which I loved.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|SUCH A GREAT BOOK!!! I liked it so much i couldn't get my face away from my kindle!!! So detailed and so much action,and suspense!!!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Runs great on kindle fire and is something we all can enjoy.  Great matching game with fun extras.  Totally worth 5 stars for us.
B0025KVLTW|5.0|John Lennon said its his favorite album because its so weird. The album is a bit underrated because it was originally just an EP in Europe, not the full album that was released in USA. Now they use the full version of course, and it is packed with hits and some of their most psychedelic songs. You really can't find a mediocre song here (okay, maybe the insturmental \\"Flying\\" but its short and interesting). Probably my favorite Beatles album.<br /><br />You also get a little comic book based on the film as a bonus, plus the book is filled with colorful photos from the movie itself.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|I can't. seem to be able to connect with my Kindle Fire. they need to make this app more User friendly.
B000002KFJ|4.0|hole in the sky and symptom of the universe are two of sabbath's best and most hardcore studio songs. megolomania is great but i like the live version a lot better. thrill of it all is a good song. everything else on the album sucks.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|good calculator needs more keys otherwise great over all. great for homework. huge keys easy to use its delly good
030758836X|5.0|\\"Gone Girl\\" put quite succinctly is simply AMAZING.  Gillian Flynn has an amazing attention to detail.  Not even the tiniest of tiny detail is overlooked. Flynn spins this beautifully intricate web of details where even the last strand of fiber is methodically dependent upon the first. The writing in the introduction is so skillfully complete, without ever once leaving the reader groaning, and promising themselves to \\"just struggle through this, it will get better.\\"<br /><br />Flynn's character development is gripping and thorough, the reader will need to buckle their seat belt, the roller coaster ride ahead is an intense one! WOW<br /><br />Gone Girl will keep you guessing which turn is next, and will make you start questioning the spectacle in which trying defendants in the media has become.<br /><br />The finale of the story has received a lot of harsh criticism, which as a reader I cannot understand.  The ending is delicious, it is perfectly AMAZING.<br /><br />If you, like me, have been growing frustrated lately with the latest works of fiction; choppy story lines, poor character development, painful expositions, and so on then Gillian Flynn's \\"Gone Girl\\" is your book.
B0090X4GJE|4.0|Ellie's sophmore album is completely different from Lights yet it leaves me just as satisfied. You will find so much depth to this CD that it will keep you chewing for weeks.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Haven&lsquo;t had issues yet. It is a fun game to pass the time with.<br />It is like a expanded version of the original pc games.
0525953728|5.0|A book you can't put down! Great read, no let downs. Would read again just to see if I missed any info.
B0099G6Q5E|4.0|The only negative review I have is that I wish they would have recorded FULL songs instead of just partial songs, however, its still a great album!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love these books! they make me want a relationship that resembles it. amazing and very interesting. love the wording.
0307960471|3.0|first, let me say that i really enjoy Nesbo's series... the characters are remarkable yet tragic...<br /><br />however, this book (which may be the last of the series?) seems a tad tired and worn out, much like its main protagonist<br /><br />all my favorites were there but now seemed more two-dimensional, rather than fully drawn<br /><br />Phantom is not my favorite Nesbo book...
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Very fun little time killer and bug free on the kindle fire.  Limited permissions are needed, good graphics, good music, and fun gameplay.  Looking forward to more games from Playrix.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome.  Did I mention it's awesome?  This is easily my favorite of all the Marvel movies to date.  Before this came out I thought \\"How do they plan to use so many main characters and make sure they all get enough screen time and development?\\"  I still don't know how they did it, but they did.  There is no shortage of action, but the humanity of the superheroes is not ignored.  The special effects were great, and I really liked the music.  Mark Ruffalo did an excellent job as Bruce Banner.  I hope he continues to play him in the future.  RDJ was excellent and hilarious as always as Tony Stark.  There were tons of laughs in this movie.  It had comedy, action, suspense, and drama packed into this one movie.  If you didn't see it in theaters, make sure you don't shut it off before the end of the credits.  There are 2 scenes, which you've probably heard about.  One is during the credits, and one is after.  Now prepare for another round of Marvel superhero movies culminating in The Avengers 2.<br /><br />The one negative is that the DVD doesn't have the extended/alternate/deleted scenes or gag reel.  I would have really loved to see them, but I don't have a blu-ray player, so why would I get the DVD/blu-ray combo?

0385344333|2.0|Successful popular list writers are under a lot of pressure to crank out a novel a year. Sometimes when you're running dry, you look in the bottom of your desk drawer to see what you can grab quickly to sustain your editors. In this case Lee Child seems to have had two separate plots already roughed out, so what could be more natural than to jam them together, then write a little stuff to make them sorta fit? Not great lit, but we're talking airplane books, right?<br /><br />So in the first part of A Wanted Man, the characters are motoring along, literally and figuratively, and the plot is actually good enough to keep the reader engaged. Nice dialog from time to time, snappy internal stream of consciousness stuff, all familiar to Reacher fans. So far okay, what are all the negative reviews about? The notion of four characters spending a lot of time in a tightly restricted space is cool, lots of time for backstory development, isn't this why Bus Stop was a hit?<br /><br />Suddenly novel 2 begins: all action from novel 1 stops stone dead and the characters spend a couple of chapters explaining the new plot to each other. The characters all agree that they have to band together to save a character who barely made an appearance in the first part of the book. You know it's a bad sign when an author tells you that a particular character is really the key to the whole thing and the reader's initial response is \\"who?\\" then flipping back a couple of dozen chapters to try to figure out who this character was and why we should care about him.<br /><br />Novel 2 requires a new setting, and Lee Child comes up with a doozy. Mind you, it's hard to keep engaged when the author plays a naughty trick on the readers by introducing, pretty much from nowhere, the most unlikely of all available situations. Somehow, I was irresistibly reminded of the spaceship Nostromo in Alien (though interstellar aliens, at least, are not involved in A Wanted Man).<br /><br />Reacher is then summoned by the author to dispose of the baddies. Child displays something akin to an erotic preoccupation with technical descriptions of violent demise, but that's why we love Reacher, isn't it? No prob.<br /><br />Seriously, it was a book that started well and ended badly. Child simply hasn't the craft to assemble disparate plots seamlessly. I'm glad I didn't buy it. I gave it two stars, one for each plot.the author to dispose of the baddies.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've read a lot of sci-fi and in my opinion this series truly stands out... WAY out!<br /><br />The pace is quick, the characters a very well written and complex, the story is always plausible but still unpredictable, like all good sci-fi it's about the people not the place or tech... a truly fantastic story that will stand the test of time and be must read for a long long time.<br /><br />In a few years, I'll probably want to read them again.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|The DVD set is beautiful and I like the fact that the discs are not double-sided...even though it's less green that way...but they do use only one plastic case for all three discs so it is somewhat environmentally friendly. There are 10 wonderful episodes...the pilot episode is sure to get any neophyte hooked on Castle. Anyone who is a fan of great writing will love this show and should buy this DVD set: there is humour, there is drama and so much more than can be put into words...except if you're a Castle writer! It's easy to enjoy over and over again...which after all is why you buy DVDs!<br /><br />I must make mention of the excellent cast, Nathan Fillion, Stana Katic (her first name rhymes with banana! See her website if you don't believe me), Susan Sullivan, Molly Quinn, Jon Huertas, Tamala Jones, Seamus Dever, and Ruben Santiago-Hudson are all impressive and believable in their roles from the beginning, and make this TV show a certifiable classic. There is a very real chemistry between the leads that is exciting and fresh, but there's also a connection within the entire cast which makes watching them so enjoyable.<br /><br />Because this first season is short, one may feel cheated but the bonus features more than make up for any perceived lack. Anyone who's a fan of Stephen J. Cannell must definitely get this for completion! R.I.P. SJC. :(<br /><br />\\"Castle\\" doffs its hat to the greats of history, naming the lead female detective who is completely efficient and strikingly beautiful after the first female detective in the US, Kate (Warne), and having amazing story lines that also pay homage to other fascinating characters in the history of crime fiction. Awesomeness!<br /><br />In Season 1, there are several amazing guest stars, Patrick Bauchau (Carnivale -HBO; The Pretender -NBC/TNT), Caterina Scorsone (Private Practice -ABC; Missing -Lifetime); Jason Brooks (Days of Our Lives, The Pretender), Judy Reyes - of the original \\"Little Girl Lost: the Delimar Vera Story\\" (Lifetime movie), plus the real-life authors whom Castle hobnobs with at his poker table: James Patterson, Stephen J. Cannell et al.<br />Definitely worth buying and especially at the low low price Amazon is giving it away for these days - $16.99!<br />Or you could try to save the earth and get it through Instant video...if you're in the US that is. Netflix used to have Castle...recently dropped it...so there are limited options for people outside the US to own this amazing series.

0131103628|5.0|This book is literally the holy grail of programming books. It never assumes you are stupid or talks down to you. It is a very small book compared to the tomes you see sitting on store shelves for most programming languages but this is because it manages to convey the information in the quickest possible manner. It has plenty of code examples for you but it doesn't ever hand you the solution to the problems it challenges you with.<br /><br />If you make it through this book and follow along with all the exercises and complete all the challenges then you will have a working knowledge of the C language. You might not be the greatest programmer in the world when you finish but you will have the most solid foundation possible to build upon. At first a lot of the concepts might not make sense and you may find yourself reading some chapters multiple times, I know I did. The book is challenging but like most things worth learning in life programming is not easy. Programming is a long journey and one where you never really stop learning. Everything you do in this book make seem pointless and you may think that you are doing simple tasks the long way because in some ways you are but no one ever started programming by writing a AAA application on the first try.<br /><br />Don't buy into books that promise to teach you how to build hardcore games or applications right off the bat. You need a foundation for that knowledge and this is where you can get it. Don't jump in the deep end of the pool before you learn to swim or you may regret that decision later.<br /><br />Having been programming for years this is one of the few books that I continue to carry with me and it has survived every summer cleaning of my bookshelf. It truly is an invaluable resource. I suggest you pick it up if you have any interest in programming.

0316228532|5.0|First two things, this is not Harry Potter and its not a comedy.  It is one of the best written books I have read in a while and I applaud Rowling for going to this little perfect town and exposing  the closed doors and minds of its inhabitants. These people do walk among us and if we look inside ourselves deeply we might even be them.  Excellent read!

B00009APK1|5.0|I ordered The Two Towers which is part 2 of The Lord of the Rings because the one I had was damaged.  Because I watch this saga over and over, I knew I needed to replace the damaged DVD.  This is a classic story of good vs. evil and it was done so realistically - following the books religiously - that I could not do without the complete set.  Whenever I need a book or video that I cannot find anywhere else, I always find it at Amazon.com.  When I went looking for just the 2nd installment of this story, all I could find were the sets, not the individual DVDs.  That is when I remembered that Amazon had another video I was looking for a few months ago so went to their website and sure enough I was able to purchase just the one I needed. Amazon is easy to use and has an amazing array of products.
B004LROUW2|2.0|This is the second book I've read by Murakami. Although he has hooked me with his story, I'm finding that 1Q84 seems endless. I noticed that it's written by Murakami and others, and that may account for the winding plot line. Or perhaps this book first appeared in serial form, because many chapters end as cliff-hangers contrived to make me keep reading. Do I like it? Not really -- this variation on the theme of Orwell's 1984 is too far-fetched for my tastes. But I do want to find out if the two protagonists ever meet and live happily ever after.
B00914JWSW|5.0|Tears, tenderness, love, smiles. Ms. Streisand, you give so much life that all I know is that I feel a better human being when I listen to your music.
B0053O89KG|5.0|It is season 4 and it keeps getting better. Love the short stories but the over all story that lasts the season always keeps me intrigued. Nathon Fillon is brillant, wish Firefly stayed on the air, and his relationship with Stana keeps getting better. If you love mysteries, thrillers or comedies, Castle hits all of them.
B0091REZMW|4.0|wow. the app is so cool it very addictive mostly fun reccomended for people who like hidden object games or apps.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|This Item Is not a Data cable as listed for the Kindle,<br /> also it is White no black available? anyway it  worked of recharging But not what it was purchased for, IE: Data transfer cable, so therefore Made it Worthless since the Unit comes with a Charging Cable I would not need another one  In White No less
B007THA4FI|1.0|Horrible, depressing, pointless book.  The characters were despicable in general, and never fully developed.  The story drags along.  For American readers, lots of British slang which didn't always make sense.<br /><br />It's a waste of money and a waste of time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is super fun me and my daughter love it... the only problem is once yo get far it takes forever to rack up points... I would recommend it especialy if you have kids
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follet is a riveting story teller. Winter of the World is a masterful follow-up to the first book in the trilogy. Once you embark upon reading this book, you will look forward to reading it every spare moment you have.A book like this makes you happy that you enjoy the art of reading.
B008NB0SQO|1.0|First of all, the most of these reviews are for previous releases. Second of all this blu-ray will not include the song, \\"When Love is Gone.\\" I will not be buying this anymore. The songs adds so much, and the edit is so glaringly obvious and not smooth at all. I am also surprised that in this day and age, 2012 (almost 2013) Disney can't just release the complete version. Have they never heard of seamless branching? Anyway, I won't be buying this.
1932735410|5.0|I am very happy to have purchased this book for my PMP Exam Preparation. I first completed reading the PMBOK twice and began taking the mock exams. I was not very comfortable with how I was faring and looked online for an alternative prep book. This along with a few other were on the top of the list. I got this one based on a few personal recommendations as well.<br /><br />The highlight for me is that the content in this book is very interactive and engaging. A lot of what I read in the PMBOK made sense to me as I was completing this book. I feel the best thing about this book is the layout. The initial set of chapters clearly layout a path for the forthcoming ones. I have read this book twice and did the post chapter tests each time. It is important that you follow the instructions, because that will set the mind for you to take the exam and analyze a lot of new situations that will show up in the actual exam itself.<br /><br />Based on my experience, I would suggest that you be done (at least twice) with this book a month in advance of your exam, then keep doing the mock exams on a regular basis in the month leading up to the exam. This way, I think you will have the time to close any gaps in your knowledge nicely.<br /><br />Like they recommend in the book, do not skip any of the exercises or post chapter tests. Do follow all of the instructions for the exam and that should put you in the right mindset to take on and pass the exam successfully.

0805080120|5.0|A great book, well-written, humorous, knowledgeable.  The main accomplishment of this book,for me, was to explain why, over the centuries of written language, prominent commentators have bemoaned the decline of their language by fellow citizens, grousing over how nobody speaks correctly any more, and citing examples of poor usage, ungrammatical forms, distortions of original meanings of words, etc.  It apparently happens in every generation. And no commentator of language has ever (to my knowledge) claimed that language usage is improving in his generation.  But if things have only gone down hill forever, how then did any langauge ever start out in \\"good\\" condition?  The author explains that languages change as people find quicker and shorter ways to say things (from \\"going to\\" to \\"gonna\\"), add or change words to make things clearer, and generalize from one example to parallels.  The net effect of all these changes is the evolution of a language, eventually to the point where it seems like a different language.  The old guard cites Latin, with its declensions (suffixes to words indicating a word's grammatical role in a sentence), as an example of a \\"perfect\\" language.  Language descendants of Latin (and for English, descendant of Old German) have tended to drop these suffixes and use word order and other markers to indicate the part of speech a word fills in a sentence.  What the grousers don't know is that the classic Latin endings were once probably separate words that indicated the grammatical function of the previous word, but that those separate words were eventually shortened and attached to the previous word, until they remained only as a one or two or three letter ending.  So classical Latin is an example of \\"degeneration\\" from its earlier form. I'm not trained in linguistics or languages, but I found the book fascinating and fun to read.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Very interesting book. Once you start reading, you cannot stop it. I think, the book is better than the movie.
0439023491|5.0|I love this book it got here quickly and in great shape.  I couldn't wait to get to the third.  I didn't think it would be my kind of reading when I read the first one, but I was hooked by the end of the first chapter.

0061122416|1.0|I agree with another reviewer: Quasi-religious, pseudo-inspirational seriously inane drivel. How can it possibly have so many 5 star ratings?
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I was an avid fan of the Hunger Games series (read each book in a day).  I was a little apprehensive about watching the movie because I didn't want the story to get lost in translation. I was not only pleasantly surprised, but this was my favorite movie of the year.  The changes made from the book to the movie were not significant enough to disrupt the story line, and the movie cast was fabulous.  Purchasing the DVD was a bonus for me.  Not only did I get the 2-Disc set, but the digital copy worked for me and my brother so we both have it downloaded.  I can't wait for Catching Fire!
0152067043|5.0|My 4 1/2 month old daughter loves books and this one is no exception.  Although I'm sure this book is geared for children older than my daughter she enjoys the illustrations and rhyming writing. My husband and I also find ourselves gravitating towards this book because of how cute it is. Each sheep, with the exception of the scared sheep looks so happy in every picture and there is even something in there for the adult reader like the fun take off of a scene from the movie \\"Singing in the Rain\\".
B000VZYXPC|5.0|My interest in The Killers came later in life for me. After a short amount of time I was hooked and now I have all of the albums. Out of all the albums, this one is my favorite. All the songs I like and can listen to over and over. They have a unique sound that I hold near and dear to my heart. This album especially brings out the happiness in me. Whenever I am in a bad mood, I start rocking out to The Killers, but this album really gets me moving. \\"When you were young\\" has to be my favorite song on the album. Sam's Town to me is PRICLESS, if there was an album I couldn't live without, it would be this one and a band I couldn't live without would be The Killers.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Bob Dylan has been a part of my life for 47 years, and I'm grateful for this latest treasure.  I regard him as a brilliant and bewildering friend and never tire of hearing him tell his stories.  His powers of observation do not seem to dim with age. I've listened to the Tempest every day for the last month.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|I would advise that you read the first in the trilogy first to get a background to some of the main characters, and even without its a great book.<br /><br />Although it is not a true story, it does bring together real events, as you are reading it feels like you are living in the time. Some of the events are very moving.

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Well done...keeps your attention and is free of hangups. Enjoyable storyline.  Nice flow to the game. I would recommend it for ages 10 and up.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|The premise was interesting enough but the melodrama, oh my god, the melodrama. I found myself skimming every time things got romantic because it was embarrassing and frankly completely boring. Oh, and things gets romantic A LOT so basically only about one third of the book captured my attention.  Too bad because some of the ideas (bewitched manuscripts, a haunted house, alchemy) were really interesting.  But if I had to read one more time about her yoga pants and her workouts I was going to scream.  It somehow manages to be more ridiculous than Twilight because the protagonists are adults in their thirties. Such a waste of time.

B000SEIK2S|4.0|This is classic science fiction. We get the grand scope of a vast galaxy, filtered through the lens of one man, who learns alongside us about the perils of the universe outside of Earth's isolation, and what must be done to protect it and the human colony worlds. While I found a few moments far too convenient (like the survival of his two friends during the Coral Massacre), I found other moments to be satisfyingly gritty and real, like the stories of the deaths of the other members of his original group of friends. In a war where 75% of soldiers die before their commission is up, having all 7 of them survive would have been too far for my credulity to stretch.<br /><br />This is my first Scalzi novel, but I will be reading more, and I am thrilled to have found him. What a great piece of writing!

B006XF5BTG|5.0|I'm 34 years old, have been working out more or less regularly for about 3 years now, after getting a desk job and beginning to get soft... had to do SOMEthing! During that time I have been basically just winging it, randomly doing whatever in the gym with weights, machines, cardio-- just to move and sweat and grunt and generally physically work. Well, I haven't been too content with the results gotten from this approach; needed some structure, some program to step it up. So, I recently picked up Bigger Leaner Stronger, and enjoyed very much the author's get-right-down-to-business approach and his way of providing practical information regarding these matters of self-improvement in the physical health department. I respected the honesty and the courageous de-bunking of some of the myths out there. Definintely cleared up much of the confusion. The training routines and diet plans corrsponded to my intuitions (that i had been doing it wrong) and that this is a way to do it right. Yesterday was Day One on his program. I am feeling good about it and am enthusiastic and motivated to continue following the instructions. So far so good...

B008J34466|5.0|Awesome CD...P!nk is P!nk!!  The more you listen the more you love her music. No other female singer today can touch the singing of P!nk.  There is not one song on The Truth About Love that you will want to skip. Her songs touch every nerve......and I am simply Speechless!  You'll find yourself singing along and feel stronger for it!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This game is one of the best out there.  Simple and intuitive but still lots to do with many challenges.  I wish it had more levels or a level editor.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Gets moving quick and keeps on going. A few suspects but near the end you know \\" who did it \\". Would recommend to anyone who likes police stories.
B009FO96ZC|5.0|Magnificent collection of music.  Most of this album is cut live in the studio.  John and the 4th are at the top of their game and at their improvisational best.  The playing is phenomenal. If you are a John McLaughlin fan buy this immediately.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is much like the real one.Don't listen to the other people you get more coins over time.Just try it out!very fun.
B000088NTE|5.0|I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at this CD for it's number of great songs and how it opened up my eyes (and ears) to one great female singer.  I had mainly bought it for the two bigger hits heard on radio but it's one of those CD's that as soon as you put it on and it starts playing, you cannot turn it off.  For many singers, the studio does wonders with covering up little quirks each voice has.  There are few female artists whose voice can simply stand out above all that is going on around them, and Lisa Stansfield has one of those voices.  This is a CD that showcases the older songs, the new technology brings out the instruments and vocal placement.  \\"All Woman\\" is the best track I think and it's one of those older songs.  I would like to see this CD remastered by the Japanese in K2 HD process--it simpley would take it to a higher level.  If you like Lisa Stansfield, and wonder if the price for this CD is justified I can surely say yes--buy it!  You won't be disappointed.  I hope Lisa keeps on recording and doesn't let that voice slow down, we would surely miss her.

0142501123|5.0|My daughter loves this book, she is three years old. She enjoys telling the story in her own words, and telling me what is going to happen next. It really gets her involved in reading, so it gets two thumbs up from me.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|Awesome knife, from the sharp edge to the commanding heft, this knife can stand alone with any other survival knife on the market. its broad blade and and thickness is slightly similar to the old British Para knife.The scabbard is well designed and extremely secure.Of course not every knife can do everything and this one does not claim to, but for the price i paid (around 62 dollars)i doubt you can do much better.Get it before the price gets out of reach! Fine knife indeed.
B008N1LL42|5.0|When this movie was first advertised I said it was a movie I really wanted to see. I told a friend I wanted to see it and he said don't waste my time. I listened and didn't go to the movie to see the film. When it became available on Amazon I thought I am going to buy it and give it a try. My friend was so wrong with his advice. The movie was absolutely awesome. The special effects are great and the story was great. I will never take advice from my friend again. I loved this move and I will watch it often. I is the best movie I have watched this year.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'm half way through this book and it is great. What I love best is that it goes places you wouldn't expect... and no I'm not talking about the erotic parts of it. It is definitely more than just a book about kinky sex!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|this.game runs flawlessly on my Htc rezound. I told my fiance that I would buy this game if it wasn't the.faotd
1250004217|5.0|I give away the book. But I got free a cd book from the library in my city. I could not stop listen was a very good written book. Many friends read it too
0553386794|4.0|There is one thing that this book is...and that is 'unpredictable'. I could not have guessed the kind of events that have taken place in this book and the sequence that these events have followed. I am still not sure whether I really like this book/series or not but then I am going to reserve that call just yet and give the second book of this series a go.<br />One thing I would say is that this is the kind of a book where you need to push yourself to stay engaged till about 90% mark (with help from some characters along the way), but the final lap is quite riveting indeed.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|This is my 2nd Kindle charger that broke quickly! The original only charged if I had it propped a certain way and now this one has done the same only about 3 months later! Amazon please work on getting a better cable for the Kindle.
0425263908|5.0|Could not put the books down......just wanted to know what happened next, the charactets are believable and can't wait for the third book
0790733897|5.0|I ordered this movie for my husband, and he absolutely loved it. He is a big Steve McQueen fan, and this movie was one of his best.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|This product worked well until it broke in less than 6 months.  The piece that goes over the top of your head broke and one of the ear pieces broke off as well.  This is just from a few months of use.  It is made of such cheap plastic that is in no way durable. It was used lightly and never treated roughly and still broke within a few months.  I don't plan on buying a turtle beach headset ever again.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Fantastic piece of work, easily one of my favorite series to date. Unique writing style (or at least, one of a kind to my brain's limited memory). Five out of five, well done indeed.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty good app. lots of fun, a little too addicting, but that's okay ;) wish it was easier to get money though
B002ZG981E|4.0|Great actors great story great acting ... I love this movie , great on blu ray too !!! U can get u money worth outta this blu ray a lot of extras
B005KDDUVS|5.0|A mi me ha gustado mucho, Es una literatura dinamica que engancha desde el principio, una trama interesante, Yo la recomiendo
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|this game is like playing jewel quest but with a twist. it is fun and very captivating seems like I'm having a hard time putting it down.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I like it but it needs a square root button and fraction buttons and stuff. but otherwise its good I like it.
B009CPGHDI|4.0|My daughter wanted to see this so we rented it and I ended up really enjoying it.  Katy is real and very talented
B004SGWYW4|3.0|This is a very typical zombie story. There's not much to tell. It's very well animated though. I liked the characters and the voices. There is plenty of gore and enough comedy to make you laugh out loud once in a while. H.O.T.D. is no masterpiece, but it's not too bad either. It's worth $15 I'd say. If you want to watch a great horror anime, watch Shiki. Shiki is amazing.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|great integration with PC Application, easy to use and intuitive to manage information. very recomendable for taking notes on meetings
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After reading about this book on a nerd blog and seeing all the 5 star reviews, I was still a bit skeptical, but decided that I'd spend 5 bucks to find out for myself. From the very beginning of the story the reader is drawn into the silo world where things seem both routine and yet oddly unsettling. After the end of the first book, I couldn't put it down. Howey strikes a good balance between the detail that makes the story vivid and yet fast-paced enough to be a page turner.
1932100660|5.0|This is one of the best books ever written on the human diet. It's unbiased, scientific, based on a decades of diet/health research and I am very pleased to own it.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Not a lot of skill involved but some strategy needed. I rather enjoy it. Worth it considering it's free! yay!
B00992CF6W|4.0|the reason is because u guys can just get this game for free on 4shared.com and not pay 7$ but overall a good game
B0089BSM70|5.0|Scream Factory has finally given fans the Halloween II release they've dreamed of and more.  Can't wait to see future releases from this distributor
B008XG1X18|5.0|i absolutely adore this app. it makes pinning so much easier on my kindle fire. the only complaint i would have is sometimes when i open the app it takes a long time to load. but otherwise. great app.
1423140605|5.0|I is the best book of the Heroes of Olympus Series that Rick Riordan has made.  I hope the next one will be better.  The end made me cry a lot.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|If you've played a lot of these types of games this one is rather easy but still fun.  The graphics are quite good and so far the play is smooth.
B004MPESSY|4.0|This movie has one of the worst things to show on a movie, Rape.  Everything this girl goes through I was rooting for her at the turn for her to start rallying back to win this fight.
0393088731|4.0|If you are a fan of Trainspotting, you will probably like this book. It sheds light on the younger days of some of Welsh's beloved characters.
B009GEBBNQ|2.0|I know most of the world loved this movie.  I found it slow, poorly written and boring.<br />Maybe it was meant just for the younger crowd.
0316228532|1.0|As a huge fan of the HP series, it was a surprise to read Casual Vacancy.  The plot was sound, but the only character with any redeeming features such as compassion or kindness died in the first few pages.  I found it impossible to care what happened to a cast of such mean-spirited people.  Only the teenagers had any depth, and I kept waiting for something good to happen, for some to have a change of heart and grow. Disaster heaps upon disaster and what little hope arises is too little, too late. The book ends as it begins, with death.<br /><br />Rowling is undoubtedly an excellent author, but she should stick to what she does well... books for children.  If you do decide to brave your way through this novel, keep lots of chocolate on hand.  You'll need it to keep the dementors away!
B000F2C87Q|5.0|I love this album, which is a tribute to bluesman Junior Kimbrough.  It is not too far off from the older Black Keys albums and shows Kimbrough was a definite inspiration for the duo.  It is a short cd, but part of my regular rotation.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The calculator does what I need it to do. Using it on my Kindle Fire.  No problems.  Will probably upgrade.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I took every minute left from my time to read it. From the beginning it shows its value. Wisdom in every chapter. Read and reread it. A manual for good life.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is one of those stories you start, and don't want to stop reading until you find out what's going to happen next.
0316227706|5.0|I pre-ordered this when the author first announced it. It was a long wait but well worth it! What a beautifully presented book full of enchanting pictures, I love it! Even if you don't adore dogs like I do, you will find the photos intriguing, the way Seth has captured the dogs in a variety of underwater poses is mind blowing. I highly recommend this book to anyone.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This is one I almost missed out on.I heard it was a good series started watching it on netflix and now I'm hooked. I have to have this complete series in my Dvd collection because it totally rocks!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|cute, time wasting game, but was constantly running in background and draining battery, using data..  not necessary! uninstalled and battery is much better now.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This story was unusual and unpredictable.  The resolution was a total surprise. I gave it five stars.  I'd read another book by this author.
0399157565|4.0|In the Wapiti Bone Bed in the Peace Region of Alberta, paleontologist Emma Shubert vanishes.  The only evidence of the fortyish woman disappearing is an email sent to Chief Medical Examiner Kay Scarpetta at the Cambridge Forensic Center in which the victim's ear is severed.  Scarpetta assumes someone taunts her while the University of Alberta bone digger is probably dead.<br /><br />She is also overworked as she testifies in the Channing Lott murder trial and identifies mummified remains found in Boston Harbor before the decay sets in; delaying her is safely removing endangered species leatherback turtle.  Finally her niece Lucy Farinelli, her FBI forensic psychologist husband Benton Wesley and her top investigator, Pete Marino have their own issues.<br /><br />This is an exciting Scarpetta forensic thriller (see Red Mist) with much of the opening chapters devoted to what is happening to the heroine and her inner circle.  The storyline accelerates with the thrills stratospheric in the latter half as the cases tie together though improbable.  Fans will appreciate this exhilarating tale as Scarpetta works a dangerous inquiry against a diabolical murderer while feeling she is on her own.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B00127RAJY|4.0|I bought this dvd to have as a home alternative to the gym, especially for those nights when time is a commodity there just isn't enough of.  It's very intense, but you can modify it to your capabilities.  Sadly, I only do it 3 or 4 times a week instead of every day, so my results are not as quick as the box claims, but that is my fault.  I can feel my endurance increasing.  This is a solid work out, and I'd say paired with a healthy eating plan and semi-active lifestyle, it can do wonders for anyone.  I love how it's geared for everyone.<br /><br />I don't like, however, (and this is why only 4 stars) the fact that you have to listen to the beginning sequence every time you do the work out.  Jillian talks for about 3-4 minutes, and you can't hit \\"menu\\" or even fast forward.  So I use that time to put my tennis shoes on, because if I don't have anything to do during that time I just get super annoyed.<br /><br />My Yorkie likes to sit on my stomach during the ab exercises.  That's a real fun addition to the workout.  :)<br /><br />Enjoy the dvd, it really is a decent workout!
B005LFQRTC|4.0|I like this DVD set of the Six Million Dollar Man. But I didn't realize until watching these early episodes, that the familiar sound effect when he uses his bionics is absent. I guess it's in the later episodes did they think to use the sound effects. John Saxon played the robot, which I guess was the Maskatron action figure inspiration. That episode was in this first season. Other guest stars are William Shatner and Farrah Fawcett. There's even a DVD extra that highlights the many famous guest stars in the last disc. Overall, I liked these first season episodes, but it wasn't as good as when watching it as a kid when it was first broadcasted.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I'm in love with this album. I could just listen to it over and over. Babel is my favorite so far but the album as a whole just gets better the more I listen to it. Definitely recommended!
B007N85ZXY|1.0|Like so many fans, when I see that Neil Young has a new CD or whatever, I click \\"buy\\" without a hesitation.  I couldn't wait for it to arrive, and when it did, threw it into the car's cd player - ready to enjoy a ride with Neil.  The opening measures for Oh Susannah were clearly sending me a message of what was to come.  I just didn't want to listen.  I made it through the first three songs and then started hitting the fast forward button.  This wasn't a case of reinterpreting old classics, as many of the songs had a sameness to them in the drum line etc. that was so disappointing.<br /><br />The only good thing I can say about this album is that I hope Neil and friends had a good time recording it.  I'm sure hoping his new album, with his own new material, brings back the shades of Neil we all love.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|great game and spin on the Bejeweled love graphics plus pattern lay out I good also great concept all around
B00004XONN|5.0|This is where Radiohead started to explore new territory. You can hear hints of Miles Davis ( Electric period, late 60s-early 70s ) and even Karlheinz Stockhausen in this CD and every CD since. At this point, Radiohead starting making music on their own terms. Sure, they could have went in the studio and gave all of us another OK Computer, but they didnt. They gave us somthing much better, something that nobody had heard before. And they did the same with In Rainbows and The King of Limbs( although, i do like the King of Limbs Basement Sessions better than the actual CD ). I really believe that Radiohead will go down in history as one of the most influential groups of our time. This is a MUST for your music collection
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Love it if you have not seem the other movies your want to see them first.  I readed the books after I see the movie. This is such a good story.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Have been playing daily on my kindle and have not had to spend my own money on coins.Very worthwhile and exciting collecting prizes and puzzle pieces.Thank you.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I thought it would be silly... but I was wrong... its really a lot to fun and a great way to kill time :)
0062082353|5.0|This book is good I am glad that I bought it & it came on time it tells what they go though on their training.
B0098VXN2Y|2.0|All the funny clips are in the trailer. And the rest is kind of boring.  I wouldn't recommend it. Also, has nothing to do with the book (but I figured as much beforehand).
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|good game. really enjoy playing it. much better than a lot of other games I have played recently. would reccommend
B009GEEMLY|4.0|I personally liked some of the individual movies more than the Avengers, but hubby loved it.  The actor that plays the Hulk does a wonderful job, but I didn't like what they did with Tony Stark's character.  I liked his character better in Iron Man.
B00846REIS|5.0|Awesome!!! Love this even more than 50 shades. It is steamier and I like that both characters have drama in their past.
B005KELW26|5.0|I love it.  I ordered it and just a few days later it was here.  My favorite color and it fits great.
B00910Y1OQ|1.0|looks good, but unable to play crashes after the introduction.  May have a good premise,  but looks as if the Droids have issues.  Fix issues and if playable I will change rating.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This book was great, I started reading it on my kindle and then found it at the library in audiobook. That was a treat, the writing style can take a minute to get used to but it really takes you back and before I knew it I was damning this internet age and wishing I could go back to a simpler time with pen pals and such. It had a very refreshing new view of WWII, with delightful characters. If you have the opportunity to listen to it in audio I would suggest it, I am not usually fond of audiobooks with more than one narrator but it works beautifully in this novel.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This is another fun, quick game when you have a few minutes to kill.  I like that you can change the background, color of cards, etc.  The only downside I've found are the pop-up ads that occasionally come up between games.  They're easy to get out of, though, by just entering \\"skip\\".  I've decided it's something I can live with since the game is free.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|we had to replace our vhs for this dvd great one of our favorite movies. arrived on time good quality
B0053O89WY|5.0|Ever since I saw a few episodes of the 3rd season on TV, I was instantly hooked. I can totally relate to those nerds. This show is not for everyone, but it worked out great for me. This was my 6th season I purchased, and hopefully more to come...
1250000971|5.0|Hard to put down. Tell Jeffery to get cracking on the next three, some of us don't have three years to bank on!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|super addicting &amp; tons of fun to play! a must have game. happy I got it while it was free :)
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This set of books is one of my top three most favorite and has absolutely some of the best detailed writing I have ever read. Once I started reading I could not stop. After reading, I actually wanted to read it again, like sitting down with a good friend and sharing awesome memories.
B006JPS1OM|2.0|This game is fun...right up to the point it screws up!!  About 3/4 of the way through the game you are asked to find some cotton swabs.  I never found them (even with using the \\"Hint\\" button) but according to the inventory list I had them even though they weren't visable. Unfortunately on the next screen you MUST have the swabs to perform a task.  Without the swabs you cannot advance any further in the game!!  I tried everything....going back and searching the room, exiting the game, and restarting my Kindle, but no go.  I'm very disappointed to have spent so much time on a game I'm unable to finish and will think twice before buying any \\"G5\\" games.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book changed my perspectives on running, endurance, hunting, evolution, physiology and happiness. It's well written and fascinating. It's a quick read and more than worth the effort.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I think this is one of the best games I've played in a while. The graphics are great &amp; display great on my Kindle.
B0055SWM08|5.0|One of those games that you enjoy just before bed, but then keeps you up way to late! Wonderful soothing music and great gameplay can't put it down!
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Please refer to JB McPartland's review for a great song-by-song breakdown of the tunes on this album.<br />This is another classic from Fagen and one that was definitely worth the wait.  Fagen co-produced the album with trumpeter Michael Leonhart; a gentleman that he has worked over 16 years with.  The result is a well crafted, groovin', beautifully sounding product.  If you are a Fagen, Walter Becker, or Steely Dan fan, or you just want quality music that is well thought-out, do not hesitate to buy this.
B008P1EWIM|3.0|Very seldom shows percipitation or pressure. Great idea, but needs tweaked a bit. I would use it a lot more  if it downloaded completely all the time.
B001EO2UJK|4.0|This is the Genesis that is clearly moving in specific direction culminating in the Lamb. Its hard to see just how good this group was unless you saw this group and the way that they humbly performed their material and you had viewed them Live during this period, No huge stadium's here but the performances were truly enjoyable. The direction is clearly seen on Nysery Crymes and by the time you get to the Lamb sadly it all fell apart Biggggg mistake for money ahhh or fame ehhhhh. The only thing missing here is their excellent LIVE album. This is a perfect set. ahh almost the LIVE album.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|this is a great book, george rr martin is a master at writing great books, i love the series, crazy stories and snow is a good character. the other books are alittle more exciting, but this one is a good read.
B0086DBE62|1.0|I was expecting much more from the excellent actors and director involved. Just never got off the ground for me.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it is the best and I love it very very very very much. best calculator in the world and it is free!!!!!!!!!!!
B0086449YA|5.0|Mark Knopfler's latest contribution adds to the amazing music that he has created.  The first of the two discs has some of the best material.  The most memorable songs are like scenes from a novel; they are mysterious and elusive because we do not know the foreshadowing.  \\"Redbud Tree\\" gives us a glimpse of an intrigue in which the protagonist is saved from certain death by hiding in a tree to elude chasers. \\"Haul Away\\" is the poignant lament of a man whose wife has drowned aboard a sailing ship  His lament to her, \\"I'm a living man, and you're a cold one.\\" rings throughout the song and is a reminder of how losses echo even as one resumes routine behaviors.  Privateering gives us a glimpse of the good life of a captain \\"not quite exactly in the service of the queen\\" as he enjoys raiding enemy ships in the Caribbean. You will find yourself humming the melodies, recalling the lyrics and playing the music again to hear Knopfler's impeccable guitar.
B000YMQI6E|5.0|loved it! full of suspense and great acting..i love the fact that the movie is streamed right to my laptop to make it easy..two thumbs up
B004FOA84A|3.0|I played two other progressive mystery games before this one that were great and challenging . I suppose from the reviews and pictures, I expected the same from this one. The disappointment for me was the length of the game, and how easy it was to get to the next clue. The other &quot;really?&quot; moment for me was the conclusion. I kept tapping the screen in hopes of something... grisly, all you get is a pat on the back.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I actually saw this as a suggestion on Amazon and thought it was a great deal for 5 books. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. I actually went and bought the 6th one and 2 other books from this author since I enjoyed this read so much.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|The item that I ordered was delivered timely, was in great condition, and was sold at a fair price.  I was really excited to get Season 4 on DVD so the fast shipping was a plus.
0439023491|4.0|Book I: good, interesting read. I understood what all the fuss is about for this book.<br />Book II: conflict predicted, return to the games predicted, form of the combat somewhat predicted, rebellion predicted. Not predicted - sadism of the Capital and who was going to rebel and when they were going to do it.<br />This was a much faster read for me that The Hunger Games. I could hardly put it down. The character development also seemed more complete. Just when I thought I knew where the book was headed, it manages to take an interesting twist that I did not expect. (Though as stated I did expect the movement of the basic plot).<br />I liked how the author draws us to understand fluffy artificial servants who dress her and do her make-up. You begin to understand why they are the way they are.<br />The \\"voice\\" of Katniss seems more mature (she has aged less than a year but that time has given her a life time of huge expeiences) but she still in conflict with what she wants to do.<br />I am looking forward to Mockingjay.
B007THA4FI|4.0|[[ASIN:0316228532 The Casual Vacancy]] This is definitely not a love story.  It is a story about an English town with a cast of characters that are not loveable.  This is the point of the novel.  I am not going to spoil anything for those who wish to read it.  Definitely a good read but not for everyone.  Justice in the end? Who can say?  I liked the book.  I read it through in 3 nights.  It got me to thinking....
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|As usual Loreena McKennitt is wonderful.  Voice of an angel.  The music takes you away and you are on another plain  entirely.  So beautiful.
B00957T6X6|3.0|[...]I was totally entralled with the telling of the tale. But then the fifth and final book was written and I suppose Mr. Martin just tired of writing.  He could have just ended the fourth book with \\"and everyone dies and the world keeps on going.\\"  disappointing.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|I always look forward to this cd.  The music is so lovely to listen to and relax away your day.  I enjoy all Lorenna McKennitt's music!
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Great Blues and incredible listening and watching. Had to buy more for gifts!!! Now we are thinking of getting others.
1440503257|5.0|It's fun to read this cookbook and see how creative it is in using the world of Harry Potter in recipes.  It makes you want to spend some serious time in the kitchen and whip up some goodies for family and friends!  Invite them over for a movie and enjoy some of these treats!
B007EDCWHA|5.0|Good book!! i like learning about each of you guys. my favourite members are Harry & Louis they are so cute and funny. hope to see you guys in concert someday.
0439023491|5.0|After waiting for the next book, you are on pins and needles and this book does not dissapoint.  Loved it.  Can't wait for the next one!!
B000002L68|3.0|Songs were the same as the motion picture, but not fully extended like i would have wanted. I was a bit disappointed about the songs being shortened, and my CD case was cracked even before i opened it. i wasn't very happy
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|don't know why I keep playing but I do. easy and fun and you can always wait a while to get more coins.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Alot of characters introduced quickly, but once you get into it a great and fast read.  Suggest you write down the couples names as they are introduced in the book with a key word to remember them, or you will find yourself going back chapters to remember them and their \\"dysfunction\\" (which is harder to do reading via the Kindle.)  This is especially a help if you don't read alot in one sitting.<br /><br />So different from her \\"fantastical\\" Harry Potter novels.  J.K. Rowling has done a great job spinning a yarn about real life in a small town.  Can't wait to read her next book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When the movie was released, I had no interest until I read the sample of the book on my Kindle. After the first few chapters I didn't want to put it down!
030758836X|4.0|Initially, I wasn't sure if this book would live up to all the hype - NYT Bestsellers can sometimes not be as good as you think. Well I was wrong! This book was great, had a lot of twists and turns and psychological aspects that really made you think. My only complaint - it starts off a bit slowly. But slog through, and the end result will be well worth it!
034580404X|5.0|Like many people, I had to see what all the hype was about.  This story may have been about a life style many of us can't relate to, it certainly stirred the imagination.  The basic story line was excellent and kept your attention from the very first page to the very last page.<br /><br />Many people may have picked it up initially for the subject matter and curiosty factor; I'm sure they found like I did, that it was a very good read.<br /><br />The characters became very real and it was easy to become invested in their struggle emotionally.  The subject matter means these books aren't for everyone, and many would harshly criticize it because of the sexual content.  I found that the subject was actually dealt with in mostly simplistic terms and was woven into the story line without undue emphasis.<br /><br />As long as you are not easily offended, you would find this a good read.
B005NS5CX4|5.0|Typical Lady Antebellum the songs are amazing! Great collection & Amazon MP3s were very easy to figure out how to download & use.
1451675046|5.0|Richard Dawkins has done it again. He is a genius determined to educate us all on subjects very few truly grasp. The beauty of this book is that it is written in a fairly simple way in words even the non-scientific among us can understand. It should be required reading in every high school and undergraduate college science class.<br /><br />Do not pay attention to those who attack it with low ratings. They are dedicated to the defense of their particular religious view and cannot abide any form of truth other than that revealed in their own church.
B005OP7162|5.0|Just when you didn't think there was an original brain cell left in Hollywood, a couple truly noteworthy new shows launched in the 2011/2012 season.  One of these shows was Revenge.  Unfortunately due to scheduling conflicts I missed 1/2 of the first season, but got hooked during a first half review show just before the 2nd half of the season launched!  After the season ended, I went back to get caught up on the ones I'd missed through Amazon.<br />  This series is smart, thrilling, sexy, and cunning.  It has lots of twists and turns you don't always see coming; it's like a great book that you can't put down!  I highly recommend the on-demand video from Amazon, good price and the quality was excellent.
0618918248|5.0|Richard Dawkins hit the jackpot with this book. People who continue to believe in their religious fantasies after reading it demonstrate the absurd power of faith among humans. To paraphrase Mark Twain, faith is believing in something you know is not true.<br /><br />I note also that of the many comments left here, a great number are by dedicated religious fanatics determined to prevent the dissemination of scientific truth. Amazon should not permit that.<br />If a book becomes a best seller and the bulk of rational reviewers give it five stars, one and two star reviews should not be permitted. That is simple abuse based not on reality but on loyalty to a faith. Those people should be ashamed of themselves.<br /><br />[...]

B008MG1E4A|1.0|This book is not only poorly written, but it pretty boring overall.  I would suggest borrowing this one from a friend before you make a purchase.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I just bought the movie, added to my Marvel collection. To think as a child I used to read the comic books, never in my wildest dreams did I expect to see them on the big screen so realistic. I watch Iron Man over and over again, expect the same for the Avengers.
B000AP04MO|5.0|Saw it many years ago, when it first came out and have been giving it to young couples  for twenty years now. Still recommend for all young lovers who have the courage to live into the reality of marriage. Just want to say, hard work and willingness to hear each other without  possessiveness can transform falling in love into a life of love.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|I found Quick's book to be one of the best mental-health narratives I've read in a while. Witty and realistic, Pat's perspective on his condition, his family, and his unerring goal for silver linings is thoroughly enjoyable.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This is a great app and cool colors too. I like being able to change the colors. I would get it again. Lets me know when to plug it in.
0316227706|5.0|This is a terrific book, whether you're a dog lover or not.  The photography itself is stunning, and the dogs run the gamut from beautiful to funny to frightening to thought-provoking...views of them that you'll never see anywhere else.  Text is minimal but informative, a few comments from the photographer provide some context...and the inclusion of actor-like headshots of the dogs on land is a brilliant stroke.  A fantastic gift for all your dog-loving - and photography-loving - friends!
0525953728|5.0|I am not much of a book reader but I couldn't stop with this one. I am currently deployed to Afghanistan and I planned on reading this for re-deployment while I was going to have several days of travel home but once I opened the book I couldn't stop and was done with it in 3 days. I definitely recommend this book.

B005KELQEU|5.0|I bought this case for my kind paperwhite. I'm using it for almost a week now and I don't have any complaints at all. Does it's job pretty well and the price is also very good. Haven't made too many research but it's one of the cheapest cases out there, and it's from Belkin.
B004SDSSFY|3.0|I expected to get a bit more for the price.  The UI is clumsy and a bit tedious.  I really got it for xls file edits does minor cell edits and entries.<br />Also found that the full version price is not the full price. To unlock all features they want you you to buy another key.  What's up with that?
B008VBYN80|4.0|keeps ya busy for mindless fun if you like that kind of game. it does not require. money if your cheaap just time ha ha
B000005HFH|5.0|chet baker, died to young.  a great talent.  great selections, great prices. all jazz listners should have at least one of chets albums.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The story was different than any I've ever read.  I love the narration of the main character that lets us get into her head.  It was too much sex.  I just don't think a young woman could crave sex that often in her first relationship.
B0084I9QFU|4.0|The original CD we all knew how good it was. Now, with the remasterization, it sounds even better. I could hear nuances that I either never paid attention to or were not crystal clear enough before. As for the bonus CD, there's no earth-shattering songs, but there are 2 or 3 really good (like \\"Al Capone\\", for example, which sounded a bit like a different, previous version of Smooth Criminal). All in all, I recommend if you are a fan of him and never had the first CD, but I probably would have not bought it just for 2 or 3 songs. But if the price is not high when you get it, it's worth it.
B00932HEX2|5.0|Suspenseful! Love it highly recommend, and you will not be disappointed. I bought first series, now hooked on watching every Sunday

B0054W4JQK|4.0|This story captured me from the first page and I found it hard to put the book down. I could feel the frustration that Chrissy had and new that there was something very wrong with what she was being told by her husband. I loved the suspense at the end when the whole story came together.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Mitch Album continues to produce quality writing.  He has the imagination and creativity that makes me want to never put the book down.
0316228532|4.0|When I read the Harry Potter books, I thought they were beautifully crafted. I bought this book because I wanted to see what J. K. Rowling would give us next.<br />My first impression as I read Casual Vacancy, was that Rowling is an amazingly skilled writer, who was giving us a very adult book; no fantasy worlds in this novel.<br />My second impression was that I could not decide if I really liked the book: it is VERY dark. In fact, the one character who seems most admirable is the one who dies as the book begins. All the characters are damaged in their souls. All struggle to get by in lives that seems stacked against their ever being happy.<br />I gave myself some time to think about Casual Vacancy before trying to review it, and my third impression is that this book doesn't let go of you once you finish it. I'm still thinking about it two weeks later.<br />One side note: This book shares one trait with the Harry Potter books in that the characters whose actions drive the plot are mostly teens.<br />Final verdict? (Maybe more of a semifinal verdict.)This is a brilliant book. Maybe you won't find it a pleasure to read, but, like a difficult but worthwhile life experience, it may make you see the world a little differently than you did before.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|This is the best of the Marvel movies so far.  I love the fact that not only does the Avengers movie stand by itself, the writers have created movies staring the characters seperately.  This way there is a lot more depth and character building than could be possible with just an Avengers movie.
B008RTE066|5.0|We can all agree that the movie itself is either a hot or cold response as you either take it for what it is, or you just don't find much to like about it. But I'd like to talk about the package you are buying more than the movie you'll watch (on DVD or BluRay).<br /><br />The first round of DVDs released early on in the dawn of DVDs were very good. Even Magical Mystery Tour looked and sounded great. But, it was just another way to watch your favorite Beatles movies. VHS/Beta/Laserdisc/CED formats all covered most of their films. They even issued video CDs of their movies. I even bought a Quicktime movie version of A Hard Day's Night back in the day. That day wasn't so long ago but it seems it now - 1993? But with each subsequent format came subsequent releases on said format. DVD was just the latest format back in the late 1990s. Video compression schemes' quality varied company to company and has been constantly improving since the advent of DVD. But a DVD can only hold 10mbps of information within it's \\"stream\\" of digital content. So no matter how well you could compress the video, it could only ever be \\"so good\\". BluRay, which is a high definition format, changes the game yet again. It forces every movie release to be improved upon to the best possible quality possible. As a result, even the DVD release looks better than the 1999 version of this movie on DVD because the master was of the highest quality.<br /><br />Sound-wise, 5.1 or stereo doesn't change much, for this movie. But it does offer you choices of audio so you can't go wrong audio-wise. I recall the \\"official\\" VHS release of MMT and the first remixing of the soundtrack (at least the songs) done by George Martin specifically for the release. It sounded better than ever! So no surprise this release sounds great. VHS as you may recall delivered very high end Hi-Fidelity Stereo sound. But for those who prefer a good 5.1 surround sound, you won't be disappointed. It delivers! It delivers in DTS and DolbyDigital as well on the BluRay as well as a stereo PCM track. (PCM - Pulse Code Modulation) offers the listener the highest possible audio reproduction for the home shy of having the master tapes.<br /><br />As for the Printed items, again it delivers. Like I said before, this movie has been delivered on several formats several times each before. From bootlegs to official releases the content of the film has been available for quite some time. So to just release the movie isn't such a big deal to me which is why this set was so attractive to me. To have the reprint of the booklet that came with the LP back in the day as well as an expanded version of information and rare \\"behind the scenes photos\\" makes this set a nice addition to your Beatles collection. Even if you have the miniature version of the booklet which was contained in the 2009 stereo & mono remasters or the 1993 EP Box Set, this is a great way to see it large again like in the LP.<br /><br />I already came across a perfect copy of the original vinyl EP years ago at my favorite record store. So really, that didn't do much for me, but most people do not have this so its inclusion is a real treat! For those in the states (or who didn't have access to imports from England) this was how Brits got this new music. So its inclusion is really a part of the package - film & music - that England got to judge this movie and its music from. They didn't get to also have the whole second side of an album with classics like Penny Lane, Strawberry Fields Forever and All You Need Is Love.  In the UK, Strawberry Fields & Penny Lane were released a year prior to MMT. In the states we got spoiled as we had the album with a whole collection of great non-soundtrack songs and since we didn't see the film on TV, we imagined for years what the movie had to be like from the music. So this helps put it into historical perspective as a set. (I won't be playing my vinyl though. I haven't played my original EP either).<br /><br />Since all things can be improved upon, the only thing they could have done better was to do what they did for the 2007 re-release of HELP! with a deluxe book and two discs. I love that release with the fun replica objects and hand-written lyrics etc they placed within the book. (Something you can't get from a Kindle version). But this film isn't long enough to warrant 2 discs. The special features and the movie are each 53 minutes long. But the special features are new! They include new interviews and scenes which were cut from this film. So for those of you who feel they didn't really edit this movie well, check out the stuff that didn't make it! lol But again, HELP! was HELP! and this is totally different kind of movie - Free Form and rather non-linear. It tries to be linear in parts to appease the masses, but really, it wanders from idea to idea, much like a Monty Python sketch show. lol But it's nitpicking as there really isn't anything wrong with what the did do here with this release. I just like that style of books.<br /><br />As for Bonus stuff and extras, the real stand out extra is the commentary by Sir Paul himself (who was more of the director than anyone else for this project). His insight, though defensive of the film, adds a new layer of how to watch this film and what to watch for when viewing it subsequent times. It helps give perspective and sets the stage, so to speak, for viewing this film in context of how it was made and why they made the choices they did.<br /><br />Let's face it, you're not even considering this set if you aren't a Beatles fan. Not at the price! So anyone who isn't already a fan is going to look for the stand alone DVD at the lowest price, if they are even curious. So for a Beatles fan, this is a must! It's just the way they should have honored their work. Put it into perspective and tell the story the way the Beatles want to tell it. Critics have already had their chance.<br /><br />I now hope A Hard Day's Night get the same respect and treatment as Yellow Submarine, Mystery Tour & HELP! have. If the Beatles were actually more hands on with the animated feature, Yellow Sub, I'd expect more than just a few nice reprints included in that package. But they did that release right as well. And I can't wait until Let It Be gets the first class treatment it deserves!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Great movie. Stays close to the book with a few changes. Some violence but not too much is shown. I let my 7 almost 8 year old daughter watch it and she loved it.
B007V508CC|1.0|At an open air flea market two days ago (Sunday), I came across this CD in pristine condition for only fifty cents. A half buck for a relatively new CD seemed like quite a bargain until I got to the car and pushed it in the slot.  Within moments it became evident that I had over-paid by forty-eight cents.  I listened on the ride home becoming more woozy from the hideous noise on this \\"major\\" artist release.  Quite simply, one of the worse things I have ever heard. As I type these words, the disc serves a more utilitarian purpose as a coaster protecting the wood surface of my desk.  I guess that's money well spent.
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|I was extra-pleased that this came a day early.  I love this series; I already owned 1.01 but it pales in comparison to THIS, Evangelion 1.11.<br />The good:<br />The packaging is awesome and shiny.  The movie's quality has been turned up a notch from 1.01, even though they're both DVD and NOT Blu-Ray.  This movie got me into the Evangelion fanbase, and I love it even more now.  The animation is several notches above the original by successfully merging CGI and pencil-drawn animation together, and it really shines during the action scenes (which are spectacular).  The characters are far more likeable this time around, seeing as how this is the beginning of a four-film remake of the original series, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and the voice acting is far superior to the series (like everything else is).  I have almost nothing but good things to say about this product.<br />The battle against the sixth angel at the end is when this movie REALLY gets good, although it was already good, the whole second half of the movie when this angel comes in is when things REALLY get going.  That, and the developing relationships of the characters, made this movie AMAZING.<br />The bad:<br />When I opened it, the first disc was loose, but nothing was broken or scratched and the DVDs were in perfect condition still.  Another minor complaint is that the beautiful packaging can get smudged by fingerprints all too easily.<br />But overrall, FIVE OUT OF FIVE (though I may be biased, since I'm a huge fan).  This movie hooked me from beginning to end.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|A throwback, and I don't mean to imply anything negative by that.  I mean to say that it's got some mysterious qualities here that remind me of classic cinema.  You care about the characters, but not so much because of psychological backstory or any complicated plot contrivance; they live in the moment, and you enjoy that moment with them.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor begins to resemble Alec Guiness more and more as he gets older, and I mean that as a compliment also.  The movie's enjoyable, colorful, and fun.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|This was a really fun game. Friends and family all had a good time. I would recommend this game to other families who play games together.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|The story didn't attract me.  But the film was well-made.  It has a real, old-fashioned \\"this is a big movie\\" quality to it, and it doesn't drag.  And, Lawrence is excellent.
014241493X|5.0|I am a huge fan of John Green's novels. I think that this was a very entertaning read. You really connected with the characters by the end of the book. You felt like you actually knew the character personally. I thought this book started out great just like all of his books really.It got you hooked from the first page and you didn't want to put it down. If anyone really doesnt know what to read next I would recommend any of his other works, you will not be let down.<br />Mr. Hunt's class eigth grade, Lachlan<br />DFTBA
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Great cast, good story, great color and setting ... loved it.  An expertly made multi-threaded story about older characters that will endure, I think.
B008H6GH8I|2.0|I hate to be the lowest rater of this movie, especially since I am a RE fan, but I have to admit there are lots of flaws with this movie.  Before I go into detail, the animation is great. I had a fun time laughing when there were pieces that just didn't make sense.<br /><br />(SPOILER, STOP READING THIS NOW)<br />(SPOILER, STOP READING THIS NOW)<br />(SPOILER, STOP READING THIS NOW)<br /><br />#1, Why deploy a Raccoon City cop in the middle of a revolutionary war \\"seeking american POWs\\" when there were none to be found in the movie?  Well maybe there was one, who had the virus go in his mouth...<br /><br />#2, There was a scene were Leon let the two lickers surround him, that's stupid on his part. In addition, there was another scene were Leon let the licker stick his tongue closer to him as he does nothing. great. that's just pro.  Also, before he goes down the elevator, there was a scene were the Lickers walked past him. what the heck?<br /><br />#3, In the tunnels, there's a scene were 3 \\"zombies\\" were talking toward Leon and JD as they were trying to open a solid metal door.  The zombie had his head pop-off into the crazy bio octopus head mode that isn't able to land a single scratch on as leon tries to squeeze through the door?  Also afterward, leon puts a chain through the door and the monsters were able to easily open the door? what the...<br /><br />#4, RPG's don't work against those big metal dudes, why send in more Lickers to directly fight them head on?  The last licker was smart, no doubt.<br /><br />#5, Did Leon really climb all the way down that elevator shaft?<br /><br />#6, The scene when Ada kicks away a little pistol from the butler, then wrestle/fights with the blonde President, then figures out she gets locked in the office.  The butler should've grabbed the pistol and had her surrender, but instead... he shows up with a shotgun after the fight scene is over. WTF?<br /><br />#7, where are the notorious zombie dogs? Those things made me wet my pants in RE director's cut and RE2.<br /><br />#8,How does that guy end up in a wheelchair? that makes NO sense, especially when Leon said you must live, blah blah *BANG* LOL<br /><br />#9, There was a scene with the beehives, and leon and ada get completely surrounded by the dark dressed military.  HOW DOES LEON RUN AWAY FROM 30 GUYS AT POINT BLANK?<br /><br />#10, there's a Truck with the Bees. Do the lickers know how to drive? Who's driving!?<br /><br />(END SPOILER)<br />(END SPOILER)<br />(END SPOILER)<br /><br />Sorry for the crazed review, as I am a heavy fan of the RE series, but overall the animation was done very, very well.  I think the scene to scene transitions could've been done much better.  Also JD is a very annoying character with a Harlem/austrian accent. doesn't fit this country of \\"eastern slav\\"<br /><br />P.S. I've just started RE 6 and very I'm pleased with it so far, though I wish when you move the L joystick, he wouldn't start running.  It's capcom's signature that when you move the L joystick all the way, you walk. you press X to run.  The olden days of cameras in the corner of the room + 360 pivoting made the game way more challenging and fun.  I hope that comes back to 7, 3rd person only > 3rd person + fps
B007FXLZ9K|2.0|I see a lot of movies, and many deal with the darker aspects of human existence.  I've certainly learned by now that just because a film and its maker choose to deal with an unpleasant and ugly issue, that doesn't inherently give the film quality or significant meaning.<br /><br />I thought that this was badly made.  It's generally more squalid than it needs to be, and it's hard to take seriously.
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|Best show to suck you in!!! Can't turn away !! received quickly no damage just as expected in a timely fashion. Will be ordering more.
B000EMGA3U|3.0|A pretty good EP.  It's more or less in the style of New York Bass-driven groups of its time like ESG and Liquid Liquid.  It also reminds me of Bill Laswell's Material records during this period, and Bauhaus on one track.<br /><br />There's not guitar aggression so much as there is NYC dance groove here, but it sounds like Sonic Youth to me.  It's weird and it's somewhat abstract and it's got dissonance and it wears its influences on its sleeve.  They kept doing those things, just with more guitar and without a funky base.
034580404X|5.0|I bought this book because everyone was cobstantly talking about how good it was and whatnot. I loved the story line! I did not care too much about the erotic parts, but I still enjoyed the books. Too bad there were only three books. The books were in great conditiond when they arrived, the pages were thin but nothing for me to worry about. The text was not see-through like another reviewer said. Overall, I am happy with these goods, and I hope to find another series similar to theses!
B009IJJ8UM|4.0|Once you get it out of your head that this is not a traditional Sherlock (a la Jeremy Brett) or a high-concept modernization (a la the recent version with Benedict Cumberbatch), you can settle back and enjoy this straight-ahead TV whodunit with Holmes and Joan Watson in today's NYC. A good, smart, crisp start that promises a lot of fun as the season goes along. Hopefully it will survive and get good ratings and not get cancelled.

B009GEEMLY|1.0|What a  let down!  What a poorly written film!  The whole team up of characters made a boring movie because the story was so lame. All the other  Marvel films with one hero was written much better. Someone really dropped the ball.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|WARNING: THIS BOOK WILL FOREVER RAISE YOUR EXPECTATIONS<br /><br />I kid you not, I read this book on the advice of a friend, and could not put it down.  Rothfuss has a brilliant writing style.  The Name of the Wind may be a long book, but take my word for it (or don't, read it yourself, you won't regret it), it is written with a LOT of brevity.<br /><br />I read both books that are (so far) in this series in quick succession, then read them once more for good measure.  These books have gained a prominent position on my list of favorites, and are not likely to be moved from it.
B008TMOIEK|1.0|I have read the book and I didn't pay for it, I borrowed it. I was not thrilled. Can't say that I am thrilled about the music either. I have heard better classical music than this selection. If you want good classical music then don't buy this. There is better out there.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Can't get my digital copy since Fox put trojon horse into every single disk. Once it in my computer my Norton 360 stop any disk from the movie! Don't buy it unless you just want to watch it throught your 3d tv. And just happen I don't have it yet. Was trying to watch it throught my 3d monitor and Norton won't let it play!!!!!!
B000V63CGM|5.0|Every tune is a wonderful step back in time.  I bought the vinyl album when it came out.  I was a senior in high school, what a great era. Hearing the original version clearly is like going through a time machine, back to the first time the song was heard. Good music is like that.
B008N2Z1L0|4.0|when i heard the first single i feared \\"Glad All Over\\" would be a complete dive into clash like bass lines and funk lyrics. I was surprised at what the other tracks offered and found it to be a solid overall purchase. if you own another wallflowers record you know jakob dylans baritone voice is a refreshing change of pace and its still as crisp as it was in the mid 90's. If your a fan. buy it, just as good as rebel sweetheart and breach
1601251505|5.0|If you like D&D 3.5 and hated the daylights out of 4.0 (or at least liked 3.5 better) you need to check out Pathfinder! They took all the issues of 3.5 and corrected them, balanced the game better, and simplified the aspects that needed simplifying (no more grapple mathematics). A definite for any table topper to check out!
0689835604|5.0|I was looking for books for my son to develop his reading habits early enough, but he never really reacted to any book until we got this one. He loves the colors, the action of lifting the paper to find the missing body part. I highly recommend it.

0767817664|5.0|Now for my 2012 horror thon if you want to call it that is the original Fright Night released in 1985 made on a budget of $9 million made $24 million. Directed by Tom Holland he directed Childs Play & Thinner. Stars Chris Sarandon as Jerry Danderidge, William Ragsdale as Charley Brewster, Amanda Bearse as Amy Peterson, Roddy McDowall as Peter Vincent. Jonathon Stark as Billy Cole, Dorthy Ffielding as Judy Brewster & Stephen Geoffreys as \\"Evil Ed\\" Edward Thompson. The story is this teen named Charley Brewster sees a coffin in the basement next door. He tries to tell his Girlfriend Amy about it she doesn't believe him. People turn up dead arond town. This man named Jerry Dandridge has moved next door in this run down house. He sees a good looking woman going in to Jerry's house. He hears screams coming from the house. So later on he is talking to Amy at this burger joint casue their realtionship isn't working out & they don't give each other the attention they deserve. On The TV they announce they found the body of this woman It's the body of the same woman he saw earlier in the day. Amy is mad that he isn't paying attention to her she takes this hamburger from this guy pie face Charley. A good bit of humor there his friend \\"Evil Ed\\" says \\"Your so cool Brewster!\\" The next day Charley dedcides to see what's in Jerry's basement he is caught by Jerry's assistant Billy Cole.That night Charley watches the house through his window where he sees this girl making out with Jerry Dandridge & Jerry pulls the blinds down he kills her Charley tries to tell his mom what's going on she doesn't believe him. He goes outside hides in the bush's & sees what is going on. Billy puts a bag in The Jeep Jerry fly's down as a bat. You have Jerry take an apple & starts eating it. It's just the arrogance of how he does it I know he's the villain but he' sort of a cool villain unlike Colin Farrelle who looked like a dork straight out of Twlight trying to play Jerry Dandridge. Charley tries to convince his Mom & his Girlfirend that Jerry Dandridge is a Vampire.He goes to The Police & he has a cop check out the house. Nothing checks ot but Charley happens to find a painting in the house that looks like Amy. Charley goes to his friend \\"Evil Ed\\" who tells him he needs to get a cross some garlic & Holy Water. At his house his Mom tells him that there is a visitor Jerry & Charley is scared to death. Again Chris Sarandon just plays it so cool & arrogant. He says \\"Afrid I'd never come over without being invited 1st? You're right you're quite right. Of course now that I've been welcome I'll probably drop by quite a bit. In fact ant time I feel like it. With your mother's kind permission of course.\\" So later on that night Jerry is in the house hiding in Charley's closet he grabs Charley starts tossing him around chocking him you believe that Jerry wants to kill Charley. He tries to throw Charley out a window Charley takes a pencil stabs him in the hand then Jerry turns into Vampire form you get some very good make up effects. Charley's Mom wakes up this was the only problem I had was with all that racket going on it took her so long to wake up & she doesn't ask why his room is such a mess only that it's a nightmare anyway Jerry fly's off. Charley figures out that he needs the help of Peter Vincent who hosts a show called Fright Night that he is a fan of. He goes to talk with him the next day he tells Charley that the show was canceled he tells Charley \\" Apparnetly all kids your age want to see are demented madmen in ski masks hacking up young v  i  r  g  in  s.\\" Charley tells him that he believes in Vampire's like he does. He tries to convince him to help him but he doesn't want to. Amy & \\"Evil Ed\\" go to Peter Vincent. Amy pays him $500 from her savings account to help prove that Jerry is a Vampire. They all go to his house & Peter doesn't use Holy Water just tap water & when Charley pulls out a cross Peter Vincent stops him cause he's just doing it for the money. When Peter Vincent pulls out a pocket mirror & they are all behind him except no Jerry in the reflection. He drops the mirror & piece of glass is left behind. Jerry is out to hunt them down. In an alley Jerry goes after Evil Ed & bites him turns him into a Vampire. Jerry chases affter Charley & Amy & Tom Holland shows off his directing skills where Jerry is following them. They are chased into this club called Club Radio. Charley tries to contact Peter Vincent he refuses. Jerry puts Amy under a trance this part is well directed like when Jerry has Amy & they are dancing when they are in front of the mirror no reflection of Jerry & the trance is broken & when he turns her away from the mirro she is back under his power. Charley tries to stop him & he tries to punch himk but Jerry grabs his fist & tells him if you want Amy back bring me Peter Vincent. Charley yells at Jerry to let her go security gaurds stop Jerry. They get pwnd. As the people run out of there Jerry takes off with Amy. Evil Ed who is now a vampire tries to kill Peter Vincent he places a cross on his forhead which burns his forhead & he fly's out of there. Charley finally gets Peter Vincnet help they go into the house. You have Peter Vincent confront Jerry Dandrige he tells Peter Vincent that the cross won't work cause he doesn't believe. Billy knocks Charley over the banister. Peter Vincent rins over to Charley's house to warn his mom but Evil Ed is in her bed cause his mom is gone to work the way Stephen Geoffrey's plays it over the top is great. \\"Well apparently she's woking nights. But she left a note. MMMMMMMM! His dinner is in the oven!\\" Peter runs off & is attacked by Evil Ed who has turned into a Ware Wolf Peter takes a leg off the table & uses it as a stake stabs him in the chest & the effects where he turns back & dies are great. Charley has been put in a room where Amy is at Jerry has bit Amy & is turning into a Vampire cause Amy looks like a lost of Jerry's & when William Ragsdale tears up he just sells it & I buy him more any day of the week than Anton Yelchin. Peter returns he tells Charley that if we kill Jerry she will be turned back. Billy confronts them they believe he is human Peter fires a gun that doesn't work Charley takes a stake puts it in Billy's chest the effects where that dudes skin melts off is great. Then you have a great finish with Charley & Peter Vincenent trying to kill Jerry Dandrige. Peter takes a cross & Jerry backs up in front of a window Peter says your time is up. He turns into a bat attacks Peter. The incoming sunlight burns Peter so he flees to the basement. They go down after him Peter tries to bust a lock on the coffin that Jerry is in. You have Amy come in who is now a Vampire& is kind of hot now. She tells Charley don't you want me anymore she tries to she tires to bite him he uses a cross to weaken her. She says \\"It's not my fault Charley. You promised me you wouldn't let him get me!\\" She transforms into her Vampire form goes after Charley. Peter opens the coffin tries to hammer a stake into Jerry's heart he takes it & throws it at the wall which cracks open & sunlight comes in. Charley tries to keep from killing Amy which is a great plot point it proves hwo much he loves her & I buy it. Charley & Peter keep busting windows open to allow more & more sunlight to come in. Which is burning Jerry. He tries to get back to his coffin Peter slams the lid Charley removes the window blinds which Jerry Dandridge is then killed in a great effect. Charley goes to protect Amy from the rays & she is turned back to normal they hug & that's pretty much the movie. If I didn't do a good job explaining the plot in my retrospective then I'm sorry. Fright Night is an excellent Vampire movie a cast that clicks well great effects awesome score by Brad Fidel. A script that had a brain to it. Tom Holland did a great job directing. Chris Sarandon was great. William Ragsdale was very good. Roddy McDowall was good. Amanda Bearse was good. Stephen Geofferys did a pretty good job. Jonathon Stark did a good job. Dorthy Fielding was ok. It is shame that this movie never got a special edition there is a Blu Ray but what is the features an isolated score & a booklet & The Blu Ray is way to expesnive. Where si a documentry & a commentary . Maybe Shout Factory needs to get on it. If you have never seen Fright Night from 1985 you're missing out. Next I will review Fright Night II.

As long as we are clueless of what we eat, we are giving others the power of decide what kind of health we are going to have. This movie gives you the opportunity of discover what's behind the food industry, that they don't want us to know.

He is one of the few artists putting out actual music.

0671027344|5.0|Like I said before, I wish I bought this book when I was 15. So to me, it's highly recommended to teenagers and adults. I really like the way Chbosky wrote this book. It is very simple though, the pages and the design. And it has like 2 pages about AIDS awareness. I think it's great. And way better than the movie, trust me.
0385742886|3.0|So the book was okay but not what I expected.  I thought it was going to be more about Thomas and Teresa and their whole involvement and it wasn't at all, it was about how the virus started which wasn't a big secret to begin with because they hint at it in the Death Cure.  I was disappointed with this book.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I am a big fan of the Harry Potter series and as such, I was not expecting anything like that from Rowling's first adult book but I WAS expecting a riveting tale and The Casual Vacancy just isn't.  I read a couple of books a week and get into the characters pretty fast, but I kept forgetting who everyone was and that's not normal in a book of about 500 pages.  It's not a bad story, but it's not a great story either.  The characters in her other books (HP) make them great books but the characters in TCV were nothing special.  I wanted so much to love this book.  I didn't.  :(

B005FISBTO|3.0|Dexter s6 has been solid. It is one of my favorite seasons thus far. If I was reviewing this for just the content Dexter would get 5 stars. The problem is with the DVD set.<br /><br />For one I hate that you cannot skip over the ads at the beginning of the discs which leads me to my second gripe. One of the clips in the ad ruins the end of this season. I don't know who in their right mind would include a vital scene from the end of the show in the Showtime ads at the beginning of the disc you cannot skip over. Thanks for ruining the ending. My other complaint is that for some reason disc 2 did not work with my laptop.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|The Sons of Anarchy DVD is great!!! I love that I was able to get it quickly. I have ordered other DVD's from other sites and the DVD's do not always play and often skip, but not the case with this DVD. I have been able to watch each episode without any problems.

0439023513|2.0|This book was a great disappointment to me: emotionally, intellectually, artistically, and morally.<br /><br />Morally, I don't buy that Katniss's actions are moral and Gale's immoral. I don't buy that what she does is right and what he (or Beetee, for example) does is wrong. The slight  bit of dialogue regarding Gale's actions is insufficient, especially when, at the end, there is no dialogue at all over Katniss's action. In fact, Gale discusses his actions with other soldiers before taking them. Katniss discusses with nobody: she acts solely on her own.<br /><br />Which brings up artistically. Most of what \\"happens\\" in this story happens off-page, as in the trial scene at the end. We aren't there, we don't see it, it is merely reported to us in brief summary. Whenever anything important happens, Katniss is conveniently sedated. And the final battle scenes at the Capitol seemed a hodge-podge of random obstacles meant to be shocking and startling, but leading nowhere. The Hunger Games were best in the first book, weakened in the second book and here, in the third book, least interesting and believable of all.<br /><br />Which brings up emotionally. I cannot get emotionally involved in a story in which the hero is an emotional mess who is sedated during crucial times. I can feel compassion for this person, yes. I can understand why they are this way. But that doesn't mean I want to read an entire book about a person in this state. Katniss was a hero in the first book. I began to worry about her almost-obtusely naive nature in the second book. I didn't want to believe that the series would go in the direction it went: to Katniss being a mere symbol of, not a fighter for, the rebellion/revolution. The way she allows herself to be used in the third book is disappointing, to say the least.<br /><br />And intellectually: does Katniss have any thoughts other than that she misses District 12, and she doesn't like to follow orders? In any revolution, there are huge issues at stake: who will govern and how will they be elected? who will own the means of production and how will the necessities of life be distributed? (you would think this would be of critical importance to starving citizens), who will be citizens and who not? what will education be like? travel? housing? I don't want a novel that's a tract on any of these issues, but I would like to know that the hero is aware of the issues and maybe talks about them with her friends and fellow soldiers.<br /><br />What happened to Peeta during captivity is believable. His recovery is not: it occurs too quickly to be true. And the way Katniss treats Peeta makes me loose any remaining sympathy I had for her. This is probably the most disappointing third book in any trilogy I've ever read.stake: who will govern and how will they be elected? who will own the means of production and how will the necessities of life be distributed?

B005K17RU0|1.0|Updated review: it USED to work great on my Kindle Fire; best weather app, period . Since a few months ago, it won't even launch. Suddenly the appstore says it's not compatible. ??? Original review:.All I need is a basic forecast for where I am or where I'm going, for the next few days. Accuweather does just that in big, easy to read text and symbols. I don't want videos of Al Roker or drought graphs or football scores, just weather. Kind of slow to open and it's oriented in portrait ONLY, otherwise no complaints.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Nice graphics. I really like the prize and puzzle aspects. It's fun to waste virtual money. The regeneration rate is just about perfect.

2090338482|5.0|The Grammaire Progressive du Francais series from CLE offers clear, concise and useful information, organized in a systematic way.  The books are written completely in French, and build a foundation for successful communication in this beautiful and expressive language.  It is particularly useful to learn how to think about grammar and literacy from the perspective of the French speaker, as opposed to trying to apply English (or your native language) rules to French.  The \\"Grammaire Bleue,\\" as it's nicknamed by Alliance Francaise teachers, is suitable for a language learner who has completed some high school level French.  (Grammaire Jaune is for absolute beginners, and those who have strong foundation skills and want to improve their fluency can move directly to the Grammaire Verte).  If you are buying this for self-study, make sure you buy the corrections book as well (Corriges) as they are sold separately.  The initial exercises may seem easy, but by completing one set (reading grammar points page and doing a page of related exercises) per day, in order, you will significantly improve your abilities in three months.  As a companion, working the exercises in the CLE Vocabulaire Progressive series will aide you in improving your everyday vocabulary in a cultural context.<br /><br />French is my second language, which I speak to my children and use in social contexts every day.  I've found that working the exercises in various books published by CLE to be quite valuable over the years in improving my written communications skills and my vocabulary.<br /><br />For those who are studying French on their own, a word of advice:  there's no substitute for conversation!  Working the exercises in the Grammaire series will build confidence and increase fluency.  However, taking a group class, taking private lessons, joining a conversation group or making a new francophone friend will force you to put those new skills to use in a practical way.  Bonne chance!

Really a good light read, yet not so light that it is predictable or dull. Quite the opposite. Historical characters in it as well as events. These things need to be researched and it seems he did the job. The unique views of the main character cause one to chuckle and appreciate the attitude.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|... if only a great drummer had been hired for some of the tunes instead of Michael Leonhart's drum efforts (under the pseudonym Earl Cooke, Jr.). This is really unfortunate, since Donald Fagen sounds engaged and the arrangements sound fresh and the writing is very good indeed.<br /><br />On the opening tune \\"Slinky Thing\\" and the following single \\"I'm Not The Same Without You\\" I don't mind Michael Leonhart's drumming, as the groove is well-attained, but on \\"Memorabilia\\" I would have loved to hear Keith Carlock (thinking back of his simple but incredibly tight groove on \\"What I Do\\" on Morph The Cat). Then follows the great song \\"Weather In Your Head\\", reminding me of Steely Dan's The Royal Scam album, with Jon Herington (instead of Larry Carlton at that time) providing great guitar work, where more punch in drumming is unfortunately clearly missed. The same goes for most of the other songs. Too bad, because there are some truly gorgeous moments to be enjoyed.<br /><br />I can only guess why Donald Fagen did not go for 'real' and expert drummers, as he and Steely Dan have always done  and which made Morph The Cat and Steely Dan's Everything Must Go so eminently enjoyable and endlessly grooving thanks to Keith Carlock's irresistible drumming.<br /><br />So please Donald: take a great drummer on board next time (again) instead of accepting a (co-)producer's self-indulgent drumming and you/we are destined for greatness again!

B008OJ291W|1.0|Ok, if you need proof that ELO wasn't simply Jeff Lynne doing everything whilst the other ELO members acted as puppets, then this collection is Exhibit A.  The reason this isn't an ELO album is because it's a Jeff Lynne album.  These are well produced numbers--giving credit where credit is due--but the essence of ELO is sorely missing here.  Furthermore, to be truly the Greatest Hits of ELO, this track list needs to be fortified with samples from the 80's works Time, Secret Messages and Balance of Power.  If you honestly want a great sample of ELO's best, be sure to look elsewhere so you hear ALL of the musicians and technicians who made the Electric Light Orchestra a symphonic masterpiece.

1592220053|3.0|(Vague Spoilers)<br /><br />A \\"fixup novel\\" (short stories arranged as a novel), featuring the adventures of Haviland Tuf, a \\"humble\\" space trader who, by twists of fate and/or supreme cleverness, finds himself master of \\"The Ark\\" - a gigantic space derelict formerly used for ecological warfare by a long-dead space empire.  Being a man of peace, Tuf goes into business as an \\"ecological engineer\\", traveling the stars, solving the ecological crises of foolish mortals everywhere, using the godlike capabilities of the Ark and his own god-like power of infallible judgment.<br /><br />This is fairly-enjoyable light reading, a bit reminiscent of early Jack Vance (an influence acknowledged by the author).<br /><br />But, by the end, I was fed up with Tuf, and wanted to punch him in his smug, arrogant face.  Was I supposed to feel this way?  An interviewer once mentioned to Martin the idea that TUF VOYAGING was about the corrupting influence of absolute power on what was formerly a humble decent man. Martin did not correct him, but I am not entirely sure he agreed.  Maybe we're just supposed to buy into the megomaniacal power fantasy.<br /><br />Contents include:<br />- \\"Prologue\\":  A short, mostly-disconnected fragment about a dying man bitterly cursing his fate on a disease-ridden planet.  Contrasts strikingly with the cushy invulnerability (and immortality?) later achieved by Tuf.<br />- \\"The Plague Star\\" (1985):  Origin story in which Tuf outwits a number of scumbags to acquire the Ark.  Originally published in a magazine, where this outcome might have been less predictable.<br />- \\"Guardians\\" (1981):  When ocean monsters start waging war on planetary colonists, Tuf is called in to assist.  This reminded me vaguely of a number of Vance stories dealing with similar themes (\\"The World Between\\", \\"The Gift of Gab\\", \\"The Miracle Workers\\", and others).<br />- \\"A Beast for Norn\\" (1976, revised 1985):  In which Tuf intervenes in a bloodsport competition.  The first Tuf story written, loosely modeled on \\"The Kokod Warriors\\", by Vance.<br />- \\"Call Him Moses\\" (1978):  Tuf competes with a religious charlatan to replicate biblical miracles.  Focuses on the \\"playing God\\" theme.  But to what purpose?  The worst story here.<br />- \\"Loaves and Fishes\\", \\"Second Helpings\\" and \\"Manna from Heaven\\" (all 1985): a trio of chapters/stories dealing with the planet Suthlam, plagued by overpopulation.  Their religion (loosely modeled on Catholicism) is evidently the main culprit.  This one seems a bit preachy.tten, loosely modeled on \\"The Kokod Warriors\\", by Vance.<br />- \\"Call Him Moses\\" (1978):  Tuf competes with a religious charlatan to replicate biblical miracles.

B008LZHA3G|5.0|Well Bob's still got it their's no doubt about it.  His cover of Duquesne whistle is masterful and current, the rhythms on the original material weave a descriptive harmony with his usual forceful lyrics painting a colorful tapystry of vivid scenes.  Thanks Again BOB !!!
B0091QS88K|1.0|I downloaded the game. Installed it three times and each time I went to open it, it force closed. Didn't even open fully. Anyone else have this issue? All I see are great reviews and I would love to try it. I have a Samsung Galaxy Prevail and Amazon says this app is compatible with my phone, so why won't it open?
B002ZG975Q|5.0|i was really not looking forward to see this movie but when i started watching it it had my attention the entire time. i really enjoyed this movie and i thought i wouldnt. i thought it was going to be a rip off of beauty and the beast but it wasnt. overall its a great movie alex pettyfer was great and i believe that he is one of the best actors in the era and i am looking forward in seeing him in all of his movies. i was also impress with vanessa hudgens
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I actually have to say that \\"Fifty Shades Freed\\" was<br />definitely the best in the trilogy. For me there was<br />finally a true, loving, trusting relationship between<br />Christian and Ana by the end. I am a true romantic, so<br />for me I really enjoyed this final book. Christian as<br />a character had come full circle as a man with defining qualities, not just portrayed as a sexual deviant. He was now truely capable of being a wonderful<br />husband and loving father.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|i enjoyed every second of this movie. it was great storyline and it had my attention the whole time. it is a love story about a guy and a girl but also the relationship that need to be fixed between a father and daughter. it was emotional and this is the first movie that made me cry. i see this movie a lot. i think its the movie i watch at least six times a week. i never get bored of this movie and i think i never will. i even have the book and both of them are great. WATCH THIS MOVIE
B009FZZK8I|5.0|Last season mostly sucked. As a fan of the comic, I understand that dialogue and character moments are is important, but last season missed the mark on both. The characters were just annoying and would not stop babbling. The last two episodes were pretty great, however, and this season really takes a cue from them. Violent, fast paced, and with character interactions that feel real and emotional, not just filler. Great start.
B002ZG97M4|5.0|i was a little nervous to see this movie because i thought it was going to be the same as the original. this movie was great it had a great storyline and the music was great. i really did enjoy watching this movie. Kenny Wormald is one of the best actors in this era. i think he will go far if he keeps doing what he did in this movie. It had a great upbeat the entire time and some scenes were hilarious. overall i give this 5 stars
B0012PV5JC|1.0|This dvd was programmed for a different region - I sent it back - registered mail - and did not get my money back.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|As I turned each page I kept wondering if this could happen in real life and just how scared I should be on a real scale.   The last chapter so intense I had to keep reminding myself to breathe.
0817439390|5.0|I've bought a lot of products/books from Amazon. I'm not shy about writing product reviews BUT I have shied away from book reviews. I believe that book reviews are very subjective and each person sees what they want and gets from a book what they want.<br /><br />I did however feel like I should write a short review on this book.<br /><br />I have bought many books on photography and I have never enjoyed one more than this book. Bryan is straight forward and very to the point. I have been enlightened by this book and understand now what were/are confusing areas of photography for me and I believe many more of you.<br /><br />It is easy to read and understand and has more examples created just for the subject than any I've read. Many before and after shots of the exact same subject which illustrate his point.<br /><br />You won't regret this purchase, I sure didn't.
0345803485|5.0|Best book ever! Normally not my type of book but this book opened up my literature. Can't wait for the movie!
B008TMA1LY|4.0|love the game but takes too long to get the other characters. really cute hello kitty game though. my daughter loves playi g with it. just make sure you have the parental control set in.
B0068FYZLG|5.0|great movie for all ages - kids may have a difficult time understanding the dialect, but it is a great one!
B0071MQBX0|5.0|I saw the Phantom of the Opera at the Curran theater in the mid 90's.  This production is almost as good as being there. Ever since I first saw it, I've wanted it to come to DVD and it finally did.  The music, the acting, everything is great.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|When I head these guys billed as \\"The Next Avett Bros,\\" I was a bit skeptical, but they really do make you think they that moniker is a distinct possibility.
0525953728|5.0|This book was hard to put down. All the way through the reading I was thinking I hope they use this book and author to make a movie. Wouldn't it be great to see a movie using the real truth for a change?
B007JMW46U|5.0|It is hard to believe this book was based on stories written so long ago.  I like the short stories and the process with which Sherlock Holmes figures the crimes out is so interesting.  I really enjoyed reading it and got caught up in most of the stories and could not put the book down.
0525953728|1.0|I was excited about reading this book, because I thought it would be patriotic, honoring the lives of the many people who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces, and the victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center, and the countless lives that were lost. It was advertised as such in the media, and I was disappointed with the author for his vulgar use of words and some of the men he served with for their pranks with sex toys, and things that I would be ashamed of. Things of that nature have no place in the military, and even though I am thankful to all of the men and women who serve daily to protect our country, placing their lives on the line, I am disappointed with the people who were so vulgar--they ought to know better, and ought to serve our country as better examples. Dirty acts or words do not make someone tough, it is their character. The sex toys should have been viewed as contraband, as should all the gays who now serve openly in the military, no thanks to Obama.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|Initially the game worked well and wsd fun  but then it started to force close and would not reopen.  Tried restarting phone, but still no success.  have uninstalled and will try reinstalling.  3 stars until it starts working.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|It continues to grow! I keep receiving points and I am not even playing! How do I stop this monster!
0689865384|4.0|This book has been recommended to me dozens of times, but I somehow never managed to pick it up. It looked like just another dystopian, but it was something more than that. It's what set the stage for these zillions of other dystopian YA novels to follow, and many have had a tough time measuring up to it.<br /><br />I think I had a hard time with the story at first because it seemed to follow the same structure of so many other books I've read. And then it dawned on me that this was actually written before nearly all those books! I still found the plot somewhat predictable, but enjoyed it more so after.<br /><br />It was kind of hard to connect with Tally at first because of how warped her views were, but as she learned more about the real world, she became much more relatable. On the other hand, I really liked Shay from the beginning, but as Tally grew more distant from her, I began to like Shay less.<br /><br />The world held many familiar elements from our world, but everything was so skewed. The way that people had been taught to think was really foreign and strange. And after learning some plot-spoiling secrets, I found myself dying to learn more. I wish there'd been more explained behind how the world came to be this way, but I guess that's what the other books are for!
B008OGJXJ6|5.0|50 Years - everyone else should just go home.  Just one of these songs would be the best any other songwriter might write in the entire career.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I was so looking forward to the release of this book at the first one was so gripping.  While the second one was good, it didn't command my attention nearly as much as the first.
0553801473|4.0|George Martin isn't writing this series with an ending in mind -- not like the formal conclusion we're used to seeing in a regular novel anyway. Instead, we're following the characters from one episode to another like we do when we watch a favorite TV series season after season.<br /><br />When I began reading Dance, almost a year after finishing Feast for Crows, I felt a certain comfort in returning to the war-torn medieval world I, like so many others, got to know so well. I'm not done with the book yet, so I may update this review later. But I liked the characters and the plots and the dirty dealings and the traveling and the excess and the sword fights and the patricide and the incest enough to read almost 4,000 pages worth of text describing it to date, so I'm not going to throw this in the unread pile.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|love this game for its simplity - you can get as fancy as you want or simply solve quickly and move onto next level
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Simple. fun. challenging and entertaining. I love the stories and the detail. I would recommend. this to any one who like gem games.
B0083Z614S|4.0|I love this book, but it always bothers me a bit that Mary is all but forgotten in the final chapter.
B00514HDNW|4.0|Nice story with surprising twists, turns, and ending. Having only seen the Will Smith movie, this completely different storyline was refreshing to me.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good book....it sucks you in good !  i cant wait to read the next  two books! I think most adult women would enjoy!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Really loved this book from start to finish! Gideon and Eva are perfect for each other in their own way. Since I do Not want to spoil it for other readers. If you loved Bared to you, you will love Reflected in you. Cant wait to read Entwined with you! Come on December .
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I wish the coins were unending.  The game seems slow.  I get bored to easy.  Not enough jack pot winnings.
1439152802|5.0|It was raining, cold and damp the day I started to read Kate Morton's latest book - The Secret Keeper. And the perfect day to snuggle in to my favourite chair and lose myself in Morton's absolutely wonderful storytelling.<br /><br />The prologue of The Secret Keeper is a show stopper it will hook you and the tale will keep you enthralled until you turn the last page. Early 1960's England. Sixteen year old Laurel lives an idyllic life with her beloved mother, father, her three sisters and brother in an isolated house in the countryside - until the day a stranger surprises their mother outside their home. Laurel, hidden in a treehouse, witnesses this meeting - and it's shocking outcome. And although life carries on afterwards, there's an unmistakable rift in the fabric of their lives.<br /><br />\\"There were moments, Laurel solemnly believed, in which a person reached a crossroads; when something happened, out of the blue to change the course of life's events.\\"<br /><br />Fast forward to 2011. The siblings are called back to Greenacres Farm; their mother Dorothy is approaching her 90th birthday and her health is not good. Laurel sees these final days as her last opportunity to get answers from her mother as to what happened that day over fifty years ago.<br /><br />\\"Not about Ma. I mean that young woman. She was a different person back then, with a whole other life we know nothing about. Do you ever wonder about her, about what she wanted, how she felt about things - Laurel sneaked a glance at her sister -  the sorts of secrets she kept?<br /><br />Morton again effectively uses her technique of past and present narratives to tell Dorothy's story. We meet her in 1941 as 'Dolly', a vivacious seventeen year old girl with dreams and ambitions. I found myself immersed in the past as Morton sets the scene and tone of wartime England perfectly. I was completely captured by Doll's life, drawn in and on tenter hooks to see what happened next. And just at a crucial point, the narrative jumps forward to the present day.<br /><br />Laurel is determined to piece together the truth from the cryptic sentences and words her mother murmurs. Between those and the contents of an attic trunk, she and her brother pursue the past. We, as readers, are of course privy to more as we follow Dolly back to the 1940's and the events that lead up to that fateful day outside the farmhouse.<br /><br />I was so conflicted about Dorothy/Dolly - the woman the siblings know is so far removed from the Dolly of the war years. Which incarnation is true? And then a third narrative from the past is added in the last bit of the book. And this is, of course, when I stopped looking at the clock, because there was no way I was going to bed without knowing the ending.<br /><br />Oh, the ending! Morton has done it in previous books - caught me unawares in the final pages. She's done it again in The Secret Keeper - the ending has a fantastic twist. I went back and re-read earlier passages with a different eye.<br /><br />Morton's writing is rich and atmospheric, with a bit of a gothic feel. The story builds slowly and deliciously, with layer upon layer peeled away as secrets are revealed over the course of 450 pages.<br /><br />Kate Morton has another bestseller on her hands with The Secret Keeper - and it's one you'll want to get your hands on! It releases today. Highly, highly recommended.rrative jumps forward to the present day.<br /><br />Laurel is determined to piece together the truth from the cryptic sentences and words her mother murmurs.

B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|When I first saw the trailers for Ponyo I thought it was going to be a terrible film.  With Miley Cyrus' sister and one of the Jonas brothers in the cast I really lost hope in it.  However, my love of Studio Ghibli finally convinced me to watch it, and I was pleasantly suprised.  The artwork is amazing (as is typical of the company), the characters are entertaining, and even the acting is great (fortunately it seems these children inherited the acting talent from their families).  While I have heard many people complain that it was more focused towards children, there's nothing to stop any adult from enjoying it.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|wow what a cd<br />great music just the old bob<br />relaxing interesting and good mixture of music, worse the money I spent on the cd<br />well done bob love it<br />cheers wolfgang
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|It moves along and being a dark knight fan which I loved and with the hype of the competition between them is say they were equal in entertainment value. While I would not buy I would rent if you are looking for fun movie to watch with the family, and you have kept up with all the other characters parts, but you can go into this movie with having seen them.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|The Vampire Diaries is one of my favorite shows and I don't even miss it!  This is just to add to me collection of seasons one & two.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Great book but initially you do have to remember a lot of characters but once you do they are easy to follow.Great insite into their lives during this period and also on history of WWI.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a game I've always loved and I'm glad to see it for my Android phone. It's easy to play but still takes strategy, getting tougher as you go. If you like match 3 games you'll love this one.
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|sometimes feel like he's just trying to get a rise out of viewers. sometimes blows things out of proportion. i originally downloaded this for free, but bought a copy for my dad to watch. obviously i would recommend, even just to learn about one side of the health care debate.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest and love that I can have it on my Kindle Fire! There are so many interesting posts by others! I have gotten several ideas from it. I made the pallet garden and several great recipes that were huge hits with the family. Highly recommend it. Only problem is you will spend too much time on it because there is so much to see.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Wish I could give it more than 5stars.  Truly a remarkable game.  Very intriguing story line - so much so that I wish I had paid more attention to it from the beginning rather than zipping through gaming aspect.  But I began getting into the story and it held my interest piece by piece.  Also a lot of nice elements and tricky puzzles.  Very nice graphics and the autumn scenes along with the eerie bell ringing in the background made it a nifty game to play this time of year.  As with any good game I was sad to see it end.  Kudos to the producers of this game.....WELL DONE!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|...but surprisingly,it wasn't!  This second book in the trilogy does not go into such detail with every sex act. In fact, some are just introduced and then, it cuts<br /> back to the characters afterwards!  What a change from the first book, I actually began to get rather bored with so much sex! This book delves more into the charcters and their interactions with others. While I really thought Christian could never give up hid Dom spirit, you'll be very surprised at the turn of events and thinking on the characters parts.  You really owe it to yourself to pick this book up. If you enjoyed thebfirst book, you'll love the second book. Much more plot, tension, and understanding of the characters comes through to the reader...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Let me state first that this is the first Kindle book I ever paid for.  After perusing the usual public domain classics, I decided to download an actual book.  Searching through the Sci-Fi titles, I saw this book listed at a great price and decided to take the plunge.  After all, what's a buck-ninety nine?  After reading this book, I am a little sad that I paid $1.99 for this book because the Wool Omnibus Edition is worth much more.  I found this to be a fantastic read with a unique storyline and characters that actually evoked emotions.  Compared to some of the books I have read by more main-stream \\"known\\" authors, I have to state that Mr. Howey deserves a chance at a much larger audience.<br /><br />If you are looking for an interesting story with a good plot and engaging characters, I would highly recommend this book.  Mr. Howey, I look forward to reading more stories by you and giving you more of my hard-earned money. :)
