B00024I2Z4|5.0|My daughter, who we adopted from China, is a HUGE Disney princess fan (5 years old).  While I can deal with that on a certain level, I love being able to watch this with her and talk about how Mulan saved China and that a girl can be as smart, and smarter, than boys.  I think for all girls this is a hugh self-esteem building Disney movie ... Mulan is not a princess -- she's smart and she's a hero. My daughter loves this movie and I'm happy to have her watch it.
B00068IOWC|5.0|I was impressed with this album and forgave the opening track, \\"Vertigo\\" given it had been an annoying song on the radio for quite some time before the CD came out.<br /><br />However, the CD is actually great. There is a lot of old U2 sound and style combined with the new. \\"Yahweh\\" which is the closing track has a nice ring to it that reminds me a lot of the stuff on \\"The Joshua Tree\\"<br /><br />If I would have to rank it amongst similarity to another U2 album, I would say it's close to \\"The Joshua Tree\\" with a little bit of \\"Achtung Baby\\" thrown in it.
B000002I8D|5.0|Never mind what he did later, and what image he has, this is a daring and truly heartfelt work. Daring because Collins did away with the dry Genesis approach for a variety of snappy R&B songs, heartfelt because he releases his frustrations of a broken marriage in moving lyrics. <br />  <br />The haunting \\"Droned\\" ending in the drum-orgia \\"Hand in Hand\\" really does it for me. The ballads \\"If leaving me is easy\\" and \\"You know what I mean\\" are both outcries of heartache perfectly backed by a silenced atmosphere, while \\"Behind the lines\\" is a crispy re-working of a Genesis classic: what a difference Phil makes here!
0517543052|1.0|Ram Das is not for the serious practitioner.<br /><br />A lot of the writings in this book are based upon LSD experiences with Timothy Leary as well as drug advocacy for spiritual reasons. While Ram Das is a very smart person and a good human being as far as humanitarianism goes, there are a bunch of other books to read that have more quality for the spiritual seeker than this one. This is spiritual materialism at it's best.
B0000024SD|5.0|By the time of this 1965 release, Dylan had already proven himself a lyrical master and a new legend in the folk universe. With his electrified performance at the Newport Folk Festival, and this half-electric/half-acoustic LP, he showed that he was not only far from done with pushing the envelope, but that he'd really only begun.

0156027321|2.0|I pick this book up thinking I would read something that had lots of meaning, or at least some fresh insights into religion, beliefs, fate or something of this nature. The more I read the more I knew that this book did not have it. Maybe I was mislead by the hype surrounding this book. <br /> <br />Another review talks about how they felt that this was actually 2 books put together and I think this is dead on. The \\"before\\" the boat and the \\"during\\" the boat. When the part about being on the boat came I was like, \\"ok, here comes the meat of the story where all the spiritual stuff, enlightenment, all the metaphors for life will be found\\". I was wrong. Its just about him being on the boat and the survival things he has to go through, like food, water, the sun, the tiger. Thats it.  <br /> <br />The ending is not much better. I did not fear like the character learned ANYTHING about his experience except maybe that he felt damn lucky he survived. Big whoop!  <br /> <br />This book had so much potential its not even funny. I read the book and was SO disappointed that this potential was wasted completely. I really don't understand the praise and awards this book receives. <br /> <br />course I could be wrong, this is just my opinion

1400032717|4.0|Read this book. Read it for the only reason of reading a book written from a perspective that you have never read before. It gets to the point that you can almost sense what it is like to be autistic and what thought process one with autism may have. I don't even pretend that I \\"know\\" what is like to be that way, but after reading this I \\"may\\" have a closer idea.  <br /> <br />The book has a very quick pace and once you pick it up you may not put it down until you realize you are already on the last page.  <br /> <br />Some may say that the story is a bit anti-climatic, but I think it fits very well to the character who is telling this tale. <br /> <br />I have recommend this book to my friends and the enjoyed it.
0670033375|5.0|To me, I think that this is a very good book that describes  the moving from the Polynesian cultures on Easter Island to the flourishing American civilizations of the Anasazi. \\"Collapse\\" is a really good book that takes place as one of the essential books of our time, raising a question people have been asking: How can our world best avoid committing ecological suicide? It also answers what had caused some of the great civilizations of the past to collapse into ruin, and what can we learn from their fates? This is a really good book if you like to learn about history, or just like learning new facts. I learned a lot out of this book. It reminds me of \\"Angels and Demons\\" by Dan Brown, where you learn countless of history of 'The Vatican.' But anyways, I really recommend this book to everyone!!!
B000000H57|5.0|October Rust is one of the greatest albums I own bar none.  Its songs are melodic, sexual, introspective, and haunting.  Peter Steele's lyrics are passionate and thought provoking and his bass is the same.  Kenny Hickey's guitar playing is very haunting and well-crafted.  Josh Silver's keyboards give the album a whimsical, fantasy-laced touch and Johnny Kelly's drums are well tuned. <br /> <br />Bad Ground:  A bunch of feedback but it segues into something not expected. <br /> <br />2:  A funny introduciton to the album with the men of Type O Negative introducing themselves.  Check out one of the boys making noises of a clucking chicken <br /> <br />Love You to Death: A haunting love song.  Kenny's guitar is passionate as well as Josh's keyobards.  Peter's lyrics are unbelieveable and deeply sensual as well as his singing. <br /> <br />Be My Druidness: A very sensual song that seduces any person. <br /> <br />The Green Man:  Another great song. <br /> <br />Red Water(Christmas Mourning: A dirgeful song about Christmas and dealing with the loss of those who didn't live long enough to spend it with him. <br /> <br />My Girlfriend's Girlfriend:  A very kinky song.  Peter Steele is very sensual with his singing. <br /> <br />Die With Me:  A love song that is passionate and well-crafted.  Probably my most favorite on October Rust. <br /> <br />Burnt Flowers Fallen:  Another great song.  Again, a very haunting song. <br /> <br />In Praise of Baccus: Good lyrics, excellent musicianship. <br /> <br />Cinnamon Girl: An excellent remake of Neil Young's classic. <br /> <br />Glorious Liberation of the People's ....: An interesting instrumental. <br /> <br />Wolf Moon: A haunting song. <br /> <br />Haunted:  There is some really good storytelling in that song. <br /> <br />15: A conclusion to the album with Peter hoping the fans like the album and he would see them later in touring. A humorous way to finish an album. <br /> <br />Again, October Rust is an excellent album.  Every Type O Negative fan should own this album.  It's probably my favorite album and I am happy to own this.  It's also very addicting.
B00008PBZW|1.0|I had such high hopes for this film considering the subject matter.  What I should have noted is that Cage is hit-or-miss with his movies, and that Woo was directing.  This is 2 hours of my life I will never get back.  I could spend quite a bit of time describing in detail all of this film's faults, but enough time has been wasted already.  Avoid this terrible film at all costs.  I wish I could have given it zero stars.
B000002UJQ|5.0|my indroduction to radiohead's music was seeing the video for the song \\"paranoid android\\" and boy what a great video. The music wasn't too bad either, I being more into the electronic music genre stumbled opon this music as the electronic genre has its own ambient music i noticed that this type of music fits very simular to this type of music. The music sounds very backroundish ambient music, headbangers my be dissapointed but this is not music to rock your head to its to chill out and relax on a sunday afternoon or late night.
B000002KKS|5.0|There will come a time when all metal albums are lined up, and one will stand out, as it does today. No one will care who sung for Sabbath first or last, because time erodes the relevance of such issues. The music will be rated for what it is, not what it was, and the dissaffected post-hippy, pro-Ozzy dinosaurs will have been been absorbed into either society or back into the earth itself. For those with an unclouded judgement and open mind, listen to this CD not as an arbitrator of the machinations of a 35 year old metal vehicle, but a lover of the music that it created. You will be rewarded.
B000000WCV|1.0|i was in my late teens when i bought this cd after hearing the songs like the chart topping \\"around the world\\" and the awesome \\"da funk\\". However the rest of this cd is a major dissappointment and this album is no way 5-star material. Other ok highlights are \\"teachers\\", \\"oh yeah\\",\\"fresh\\", \\"revolution 909\\" are some of the other so-so tracks that are listenable. The rest well is annoyingly unbrearable(rock & roll)and unlistenable filler that will ultimatly lead to a terrible headache if you listen to it for too long. download the good songs or get the singles but don't buy it coz its not worth the money, buy discovery instead.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|O man I love this movie! I've watched it 14 times now and every time I can't stop laughing. There are two types of people in this world: those who love Napolean Dynamite and those who hate Napolean Dynamite. My favorite character in Napolean Dynamite is Uncle Rico. I love how he allways talks about his HS football days. lol. Watch the movie with an open mind and be ready to laugh!    Goal in Life: Watch Napolean Dynamite 1000 times
B000063JDE|5.0|Blue Velvet may just be the largest Love/Hate Phenomenon in film history. You will either love it or hate. And after seeing the movie again yesterday, it's not hard to see why. The film has several scenes that reach the barrier of what a lot of viewers are willing to take. The movie never lets it's viewers off easily. It is violent, has several scenes that involve female degradation, and a villian who uses the \\"F\\" word more times then any character I have ever seen in any movie. <br /> <br />This may not sound like an incredible film from my review. And I don't want to waste any space decribing the films main plot. David Lynch films are as unique as it gets. You have to see this film for yourself to decide whether or not you like it. <br /> <br />The film does pack some of the most well constructed suspense scenes I have ever seen. It features an incredible performance by Dennis Hopper. But the real reason to see the movie is the look and feel that the dvd version captures perfectly. The colors and imagery of this film will be burned into your retinas for weeks after you've watched it. From things as simple as roses and fire trucks, to underground bugs and construction yards this movie looks beautiful. So my best advice if you've never seen this movie is to rent it first. Like I said, people either love it or hate it, Im part of the former group. Overall Rating:A+
B0002F7I9Y|1.0|I received this CD as a Christmas gift. With the single exception of the duet with Bonnie Raitt, this was a total disapointment to me. Do yourself and Brother Ray a favor. Get a CD of his earlier works. This simply does not work.
B00003CX9S|5.0|For years i have been watching this movie on the old paramount fullscreen vhs. The image was cropped, dark and very grainy. I always assumed that was how the film should look since it looked no different than the cover art. Now that I have seen this dvd I view the film in a very different way. <br /> <br />The image on this dvd is beautiful. It is expanded to it's original theatrical aspect ratio, and the sound has never been more clear. <br /> <br />The Elephant Man tells the truly powerful story of John Merrick, played brilliantly by John Hurt. Horribly deformed, John Merrick is discovered by Dr. Treeves in a freakshow. His caretaker is an overbearing man who will never let his \\"Treasure\\" go. After Dr. Treeves convinces his caretaker to bring John to the hospital to give him medical attention, Dr. treeves realizes the remarkable find he has in his care, he tells the caretaker off and begins to care for John Merrick himself. <br /> <br />What follows is one of the handful of truly great stories of the search for acceptance, and the power of the human spirit. The film is not without it's flaws, mainly the sometimes questionable makeup on the title character. Despite the few flaws this is one of the most well acted, well directed, and all around best film of 1980, and one of the best films of that entire decade. Overall Rating:A- <br />
B00005OAIE|5.0|This is one of my most favorite cds ever. It never gets old, and I never get tired of hearing any of the songs because they are that good. The lyrics discuss relavent issues in today's world, and gives the listener a sense of new hope. Room For Squares is a very positive cd, and that's what I love about it, John Mayer sings about everything and anything. If you like any of his hits such as &quot;Your Body is A Wonderland,&quot; I highly recommend getting this cd, because you will not regret it, I'm dead serious!
B0002X314C|5.0|This CD is absolutely EXCELLENT...and even that's an understatement!  I totally agree with what the other's opinions regarding how 'live' and very well-put together this CD is.  Although 'Alright' is my favorite, every single track on this CD in my opinion was a hit.  Talk about ending the year with a masterpiece!!!...and I certainly hope Mr. Legend won't keep us in suspense to long awaiting the next CD.  Bravo!!!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|If you like Avril Lavigne's music at all, and even have her first cd, or if you don't and like her hits on the radio, GET THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!! It is awesome, all of the songs deserve to be hits, and she's incredible, writing her own songs, and being such a great singer. Her music is addictive and will keep you wanting more, and thats how music should be, you won't regret this purchase, don't let her personality get in the way of the awesome music that she can create and did create.
0792163710|5.0|At the outset I must state that I thoroughly enjoyed the film.  The DVD transfer is strikingly beautiful (a few minor hazy spots) with general sharpness throughout. <br /> <br />It struck me that in Joey we see reflected the audiences' adulation for the heroes of western movies through the years.  He worships Shane as we worshipped John Wayne and the other icons of that great genre, the western.  When we see the fistfight with in the background Joey munching away on a piece of candy, we see ourselves, munching away (probably on popcorn). <br /> <br />Quite a timeless movie, and should be at home in any DVD library, to be returned to time and again.
B00005JMXX|2.0|I just saw \\"Day after Tomorrow\\" tonight. It started interesting at first, with volleyball-sized hail in Tokyo and an F5 tornado outbreak in LA. I believe this was inspired by a television special on what would happen if an F5 tornado were to strike Dallas, except that this movie took 8 or so tornadoes to do what just one tornado did in the special. Then the ice and huge storms came, and I recogized the story immediately. It is a movie version of \\"The Coming Global Superstorm\\", which I reviewed in 2000. At that time I wondered what the science was behind the book. The movie takes the controversial science and adds plenty of Hollywood hype, with bits of \\"Titanic\\", \\"Deep Impact\\", and \\"Independence Day\\" thrown in. I still don't know if it could happen, although I think not. But the main fault I find with the movie is that it addresses the wrong crisis. Global climate change is a problem that our society needs to address, but the big problem is peak oil. If we are going to have less oil, gas, and coal in coming years, then climate change ought to ease a bit instead. The oil problem could affect all of us, so I felt that we needed a movie which addresses that instead and perhaps be based on something like Kenneth Deffeyes' \\"Hubbert's Peak\\".
B00004BZ0N|5.0|When this album came out 25 years ago, I was 17 and listening to whatever crap they played on the radio.  This album, more than any other, showed me that there's a lot more to music than what the record companies tell the radio stations to play. <br /> <br />This record is so good, it's hard for me to talk about it without sounding like an ineloquent dufus, so I'll let others describe the music.  (I know that doesn't make this review very \\"helpful\\".) <br /> <br />I had a chance to meet Joe Strummer in the summer of 2002.  I just shook his hand and said \\"thank you\\".  Now, two years after his death, I am very glad I did. <br /> <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|Anyone noticed during Episode IV, when the TIE Fighters are attacking the Millenium Falcon en route to Yavin, that there are occasionally a faint red or green transluscent box around some of the TIE's?  I'm not sure if it's just the way the DVD is or if it's a glitch or something, but it looks like it could be some digital CGI thing that's not edited out properly or something.  I tried it on my player and laptop and saw it both times.  Just wondering if I got a bad DVD, the rest of the movie was great.      I'm not too worried about the parts George changed, it's not like they're crucial plot points or anything, and I guess they are his movies.  I wouldn't have made the changes had it been me, but I don't think it takes away from the overall timelessness of the films.  I did notice that for 1977, 80, and 83, those puppets and creature costumes still look surprisingly real...sometimes even more real than the CGI stuff that's been added.  But overall it's still the trilogy I saw as a kid, and it's not gonna disappoint me seeing the changes each time I watch the films from this set.
B00006JSS8|5.0|The track listing sequence on Amazon's website slightly  <br />differs from the track sequence the CD I own. The track  <br />sequence from my CD is as follows:  <br /> 1.

Every song shows what a musical <br />genius he is, even though the term gets used more than it <br />should, he is worthy of the title. His influence can be <br />found in today's popular artists, namely the Red Hot Chili <br />Peppers, who did a cover version of Higher Ground, and Will <br />Smith, who used I Wish and reworked it into the song Wild <br />Wild West, which was the title track for the movie of the <br />same name. If there is a regret with regards to this  <br />collection, it is there wasn't enough room to include his <br />Ebony & Ivory duet with Paul McCartney. I believe that  <br />track can be found on Paul McCartney's single disc <br />compilation entitled All The Best. Nonetheless, a very <br />impressive effort to catalogue Stevie Wonder's most <br />important work on a single disc, which isn't easy to do <br />considering hislongevity and the quality of his songs. <br />  This would be a good buy for the Stevie Wonder novice <br />fans, and even for the ones who have been with him since <br />the beginning of his rise to fame in the 1960s, when he <br />was one of the signature voices for Motown Records. If  <br />you're a serious Wonder fan who has all his albums, you  <br />probably don't need to get this album, unless you like  <br />the idea of having most of his significant songs on a  <br />single CD. It is well worth the price and then some. <br /> <br />

B0006284JQ|4.0|I got this cd for christmas. Its great for someone who loves Britney Like I do. But I have all her cds so its not like I needed it. She has 3 new songs on it, My Prerogative, Ive just begun (having my fun) and Do something (i think thats what its called). I like My Prerogative and Ive just begun but Do something isnt too great. The remix disc sucks! I dont like remixes. I really like the cover of the cd though, she looks hot and its shiny. I wouldnt have bought this for myself personally since i have all the songs already but im still glad I have it.
B0006SSOHM|4.0|For my part, it was quite an impulsive move to view \\"Saw\\".  I had no real pre-conceived ideas beyond having heard that it was similar to \\"Seven\\".<br /><br />Although I can only give the film 4 stars, I can recommend it to all viewers of crime thrillers.  The reason for not offering a further star is that, upon reflection, the plot is perhaps too far fetched.  That point aside, the film was truly chilling.<br /><br />In brief, two men are chained together in a filthy basement toilet area.  They each have a saw although the saw is only sufficient to sever a limb and not adequate for braking their chains.  If they cannot escape within about 8 hours they will be killed.<br /><br />Through a series of flashbacks, the viewer is able to piece together a series of horrible murders that are all connected.  The connection is both the horror of the crime and the fact that the victims have a link with a local hospital.  Yet, it is only at the film's end that we come to learn who is the mastermind of the murders.  It is at this point, however, that the plot becomes somewhat implausible.<br /><br />Despite my misgivings about the plot, \\"Saw\\" is excellent drama that will keep all viewers on the edge of their seats.

0393035158|5.0|In a world where religious fervour seems to have the upper hand, it is a breath of fresh air to read this work by Sam Harris.  Irrational interpretations of history and the consequences that follow are put to the sword.  At last, rationality can be seen to offer a challenge to the ignorance that is religion.<br /><br />In many respects, Sam Harris is a courageous man for daring to state the obvious; that is, the emperor has no clothes.  For too long, the bigotry and ignorance of organized religion has been allowed to prosper without challenge.  Why on earth do we accept and \\"respect\\" views of the world that have no rational support when we would dismiss such logic if it were to be put forward in any serious area of science?  Why are we meant to kowtow to blind faith when this faith has such a sordid past?  Remember, it was the clash of Christianity and Islam that gave us the crusades.  It was Christianity that turned a blind eye to the holocaust.  It is Christianity that supports creationism as science and it is Christianity that condemns stem cell research when this may offer real cures to horrible global illnesses.  Finally, it is Islam that supports the killing of innocent people in the name of its religion.  When will all this insanity end?<br /><br />I have little doubt that Sam Harris' book will anger the devout amongst us.  This is inevitable as these people are scared to think and ask questions of their religious masters.  Harris is thus a both a man of courage as much as a spokesman for a greater humanity that religion despises.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|\\"Brothers in Arms\\" sold about 25 million CDs and became the all-time best seller in England.  Yet, I would rate it number four in quality among Dire Straits' six studio albums, falling behind \\"Love Over Gold,\\" \\"Making Movies, and \\"On Every Street.\\"     I believe it sold because the timing was perfect in 1985 to take advantage of the new CD format, the Straits did a huge world tour, and the album has two great songs.  The first, \\"Money for Nothing,\\" is an infectious head-banger.  The second \\"Brothers in Arms\\" is beautiful, deep, and moody.  The rest of the songs range from fair-to-middling to good.     Well, you've gotta get to know these two songs.  You can get them by buying this CD or one of several live versions. Listen and see a hard-rocking \\"Money for Nothing\\" on the DVD \\"Music for Montserrat\\" with Mark Knopfler of the Straits, Sting, Eric Clapton and a wildly enthusiastic crowd. \\"Brothers in Arms\\" on the same CD is as lush as a Beethoven sonata with a full symphonic orchestra backing up Knopfler's evocative guitar.  The contrast in style between the two songs is typical of Dire Straits.  They did rock, country, pop, blues, and a little bit of everything else, with Knopfler's guitar holding it all together.

B0002Y69NG|5.0|It's great to read from others who grasp the intent of the Wachiosky Brothers, having been in a roomful of people who dismissed Matrix 2 & 3 with typical smug groupspeak. It is common human nature to dismiss what is not understood as stupid, ironically. I had a wierd sensation that my friends were blissfully choosing to stay in the Matrix. What a shake your head moment. <br /> <br />I loved Matrix 1 when it first came out, but only from a superficial perspective. Fortunately, I have been drawn to studying various areas of philosophy and science since then and was able to view 2 & 3, when they came out, from an improved perspective. What a pleasure to go back and rediscover 1 from a more educated stance. <br /> <br />Perceptions can be tricky, and from watching the brothers through the many background materials in this great 10 disc set, it's easy to see why they would be dismissed by many immersed in our culture of superficial values. It is good that they choose to create a vehicle that encourages people to open up discussions, and thus their minds. Great teachers do this, rather than tell you what to think. Would that we could all have the brothers' level of confidence, inviting and including critics' viewpoints; the brothers are a rarity to be appreciated. <br /> <br />The boxed set has an attractive housing, the raining code in reflective green. The individual DVD holders are odd-the DVD's overlap and it was hard to remove the one underneath-the actual movie one-without scraping it on the hub, so it seemed you must remove both-not the greatest design functionally. Perhaps it was an intentional design choice in terms of the theme that getting to the source is not easy ;) The covers have different images from the movie, and I missed the ones from the original DVD covers, especially the first one with the three main characters in their very cool stances. However, the audio & video content is just terrific overall. <br /> <br />This set is overflowing with viewpointsabout the trilogy, ranging from superficial to deep, pro & con, fun to serious. It is a multi-layered-angled-sensory pleasure, just like the brothers and their multi-platform methods of expressing their vision. Fans will be thrilled to acquire the set.
B000000993|5.0|man, I cannot say enough good things about this album. I would have to say this this album is definitely, without a doubt, THE best heavy rock album of the 90's. hands down. this is one of those albums that I can listen to a million times (and believe me, I have) and STILL not get tired of it. and with this album, every aspect of it is incredible. Maynard's vocals gives me goosebumps. haunting and amazingly angry and emotional. and unlike all those other pathetic \\"vocalists\\" out there who don't even come close (Staind, Godsmack, etc...), Maynard can actually SING. and his lyrics are so good, I wish they were my own. Adam's guitar leaves me speechless. as a guitarist, I would kill for his tone. crushingly heavy, yet extremely raw and primative. and his playing has a metal feel with some truly creative, beautiful, and unique touches. Paul's bass playing is to me, one of the focal points of this album. THIS is what bass playing should sound like. note to all aspiring bassists out there: this is the tone that you want. thick and sludgy, yet crisp and solid. and last but not least, Danny's drumming is some pretty massive stuff. crushing bombast played with stunning talent. definitely one of the best rock drummers of the 90's, and 00's... all this, topped off with some really great production, and insane artwork, make this a f*cking brilliant album. I have over 1000 CD's in my music collection, and I would have to say without hesitation that Undertow is definitely in my top 10 favorite albums of all time.
B0000584V3|4.0|This album reminds me of a more melodic Enslaved circa Below The Lights mixed with the prog band Porcupine Tree without P.T.'s psychedelic leanings.  Death metal vocals, and guitar stylings are combined with clean vocals, acoustic guitar and piano interludes in the same, often long song.  This is some difficult to classify, eclectic stuff.  And that is both Blackwater Park's strength and it's weakness.  A few of the songs are simply unfocused sounding because of all the genre hopping, others, such as the Drapery Falls, are stronger for the eclectisism.  The song builds logically and becomes gradually more intense.  The contrasts between the acoustic and metal sections are well done and compelling.<br /><br />Opeth's Blackwater Park uses melody and texture, acoustic and electric guitars in a sophisticated fashion, and when it works, the listener is taken on an interesting and emotional journey.  They have a good, if somewhat cold melodic sense, the singer sings cleanly well and growls with the best of them.  Unfortunately their pretentions towards making grand statements can sometimes sound portentious and pompous such as the acoustic and quiveringly whimpy beginning of Dirge for November.  They can be a little too serious for their own good.  But in general Blackwater Park is very good.  I'd recommend this to people who like metal that takes chances and to those who enjoy a lot of dynamic and timbral variation.  A Deicide album this isn't.
B00063MBU8|1.0|Simple Plan are one of those bands that genuinely want you to feel their pain, maaaaaan - to tap into their anguish, as artificial as it may seem (at least, to those of us over the age of, say, 13).  I don't buy it for a second - their pain is about as contrived as their \\"punk\\" classification.  And let's face it, the only connection they have to punk is extraneous - because they wear spiked bracelets and probably run around knocking over clothing racks and getting into food fights at shopping malls, that somehow warrants their musical categorization.    This is what it comes down to: If you think Simple Plan are punk rock, just listen to this CD.  If you still insist on labeling them as punk rockers, you either:    a) Think Avril Lavigne is, as she proclaims, \\"like, a hardcore punk!\\"  b) Probably own an 'N Sync or Britney Spears CD  c) Have never listened to classic punk acts like The Clash or Sex Pistols, or contemporary acts like Bad Religion or Pennywise  d) Believe that someone must appear on TRL in order to establish their \\"punk credentials\\"  e) All of the above    The music on Simple Plan's sophomore release Still Not Getting Any is so tame and streamlined, it's impossible to believe that some members of the band actually have roots in punk rock (going back to a band called Reset, who were actually decent).  Comparisons to Avril Lavigne and Good Charlotte are not without merit (heck, even Good Charlotte rocks harder than this), or I would even go so far as to compare it to the sound of a boy band picking up instruments and playing what they considered \\"edgy rock music\\".  Yeah, edgy - most of these songs make John Mayer look like Cradle Of Filth.    What makes this album even worse are the lyrics.  It's basically the same \\"My life is so miserable despite the fact that I'm a millionaire with many luxury cars and a girlfriend who loves me\\" themes that we've come to expect from Simple Plan in the past.  The funniest part of all is that the members of this band arepushing 30, yet the songs appear to be written from the perspective of a whiny teenager.  Witness these brilliant lyrics from \\"Welcome To My Life\\": \\"Do you ever wanna run away? / Do you lock yourself in your room? / With the radio on turned up so loud / That no one hears you screaming ... You don't know what it's like to be like me\\".  Yes Pierre, you're right - I don't know what it's like ... to have nothing to overcome, to have no adversities, to have millions of dollars, multiple luxury cars and maids and butlers to wait on me hand and foot ... so yeah, I guess you're right.  Or how about \\"Me Against The World\\": \\"I'm a nightmare, a disaster ... But I'll make it on my own ... Me against the world\\" - all over the same glossy, overproduced pop/rock that they've always put out.  These guys are millionaire rock stars with millions of fans around the world - do they actually think that any of us are dumb enough to fall for this \\"woe is me, I'm all alone in this world\\" charade?  Well, this album did go to # 3 on the charts, so apparently there are some people who fell for it.  Further proof that the buying public has become increasingly naive - and increasingly favors image over substance.    In summary: It's another slick, commercial, and incredibly bland album from Simple Plan - just as I expected.  And these pretty boys are using a sales pitch as old as time: Pretend you've been abused and that every day is a struggle, and that making tons of money, having tons of fans and friends and living the good life is, like, such an ordeal, batting those puppy-dog eyes for maximum impact, and the little girls will understand - and make it easier for you to afford another mansion.  These guys are about as punk rock as Phil Collins.  And their anguished frat boy shtick?  I'm buying it about as much as I would Colin Farrell joining a monastery.  This CD is a must to avoid.
B0002TT0NW|1.0|I've read all the Harry Potter books and very much enjoyed the first two movies. So I was greatly anticipating this new, darker installment to the Potter movies. But this movie is a major disappointment. The direction, and especially the art direction, are completely misguided and poor at best. I wonder if the director even read the book?  The magic and wonder that permeated the first two movies is completely missing and an element of drab, shabbyness has been introduced.  Hogwarts looks like a dirty, grey gothic castle, and Hogmeads looks like a drab, colorless place that I wouldn't want to visit.  Where's the magic, warmth and color?  The characters no longer wear robes, but jump around in dirty sweatpants and jackets. What happened to the school uniforms?  The movie looks shabby and the color scheme is primarily a depressing shade of blue.  Even the first scene where Harry inflates his aunt Marge was disappointing, she was much nastier and comically pompous in the book.<br /><br />In fact everything is much worse than the book, which is not something I would say about the first two Potter movies. The director, Alfonso Cuaro'n, misses many nuances of the characters and plot and in my opinion sucks (why in hell did they use this jerk?).  Bring back Chris Columbus who did the first two.  He paid attention to the book's plot and the art direction was a thousand times better.  I understand that Cuaro'n wanted to bring out the darker aspects of the book, but he went way too far and over the top and changed the plot for the worse in many instances.<br /><br />For example (and these are only just a few) Hermione's reason for having the time turner was barely mentioned until the end of the movie and there was very little questioning of Hermione as to her unexpected appearances/absenses or mention of her taking extra classes by Harry and Ron. It was briefly touched upon. Prof. Dumbledoor has all the gravitas and power of Barney Fife but with a third of the personallity, HORRIBLE casting on his part. Prof. Lupin had a completely different look than described in the book and the werewolf was ridiculous looking. Prof. Trelawney was also completely different than the book and might as well have not even been in the movie for all her character contributed, and Crookshanks barely appeared and his enmity towards Scabbers is never touched upon. The relationship between James and Lily Potter, Sirius Black, Lupin and Peter Pettigrew isn't clear. No mention is made as to who Mooney, Padfoot , Wormtail and Prongs are or what their relationship they have to the Marauders Map or how Lupin knew it was a map or how to use it!  The dementors couldn't fly dammit, and didn't attack Harry in the air during a Quidditch match and on and on and on. The only thing in this movie that is worth a damn is Gary Oldman's portrayal of Sirius Black, which was spot on, ie properly psychotic. If you are a fan of the books as I am, you most likely won't like this movie because it leaves so much out.  If you've only seen the movies, you may find this train wreck enjoyable, I didn't.  But I have to say you'll probably be confused  because of the poor editing and direction. In future I won't be going to see another Potter movie and will instead read the books.  Perhaps one star is too low a rating, but I feel disappointed.<br /><br />Update to the review: I for reasons known only to myself watched this awful movie again and have to say that one star is more than appropriate. The movie really rates negative points. BTW Harry's Patronus was not a blob of light as portrayed in the movie, but a frigging stag. I hope Cuaron rots in hell.ng on his part.

B000002HRE|5.0|ah yes, here we go again, people getting pissed off because of their own problems in their life so they take out their agression by calling metallica sell outs and make everybody else think theyre hardcore because they dont like metallicas catchier stuff also. same old story. never listen to these type of people without listening to the album for yourself. metallica arent sellouts, in order to be a sellout you need to drastically change your music style to appeal to the crowd at that time, in this case the nu metal post grunge crap like korn and limp bizkit. listen to this album and you can clearly see that metallica has more talent in their fingernail than all the members of korn and limp bizkit combined. this is good 90s hard rock, metallica didnt sell out, theyre naturally progressing so that they can give all people a little bit of metallica. if they made a bunch of master of puppets-liek albums, people would complain that all their songs sound the same. if you notice, when slayer changed their style on south of heaven, that album still got 4 and a half stars, because not as many people like them. people down metallicas change in style because now alot more people liek them and it pisses off the puppets-zealots because they wanted to be hardcore and angst ridden with a band that receives no airplay. reload is just a natural change with the times, so listen to the album before judging it. best songs are fuel, the memory remains, devils dance, unforgiven 2, bad seed, and prince charming.
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|Yes, I am one of the few who did record the concert almost 20 years ago, waking up in Brooklyn, NY at 6:00am to catch Status Quo lead off and watching from beginning to end. I've been watching my VHS copies all these years, so I was a bit hesitant to own the DVD releases after reading all the negative reviews here.  I got the DVD set as a Christmas gift, and I've been able to review it against my VHS copies. So let's compare: <br /> <br />First the bad news: Yes, it's true that there are a number of artists missing, not only Led Zeppelin, but also Men at Work, The Four Tops, The Hooters, etc. And yes, there are also many songs missing from artists' sets. (for example, Black Sabbath's Iron Man, nearly all of Nik Kershaw's set, etc.). I don't completely buy the excuse given in the booklet that the footage is simply lost, since Duran Duran's full performance is included with the exception of a laughably bad performance of a View to a Kill (Simon Lebon hits a wonderfully sour note), so I suspect some performances were deliberately excluded.  <br /> <br />Now the good news: If you watched this 20 years ago and have been watching your VHS copies all these years you'll be happy to find additional artists and songs in the collection that NEVER aired in America, at least in NYC where I watched.  (I don't know if other states got different feeds than NY, but I doubt it). In one particularly infamous memorable moment, stations here in NY cut away from Wembley when Elvis Costello was about to perform in favor of airing Joan Baez in Philly. Being a huge EC fan, I was pretty pissed. Since the concerts were going on simultaneously throughout the world, stations would often cut away from artists midway through their sets to go to another artist elewhere.  <br /> <br />In the case of the stateside feeds, some of the European artists less popular in the states were overlooked and didn't air at all. Other artists that never aired in America at the time include Adam Ant, Howard Jones,Freddie Mercury and Brian May's acoustic performance, INXS, and Cliff Richard, for example. Also on a positive note, some of the artists' who did air stateside now have fuller sets than what originally aired. Queen's performance of Bohemian Rhapsody never aired stateside, as they were joined already in progress performing the end of Crazy Little Thing Called Love. (which, oddly enough, then segued into Hammer to Fall during broadcast rather than We Will Rock You as it appears on the DVD); U2 was also originally joined already in progress, so US watchers tuned in midway through Sunday Bloody Sunday. Now you get the full performance. ALSO NOTE: The Who, David Bowie, and Led Zeppelin did not appear throughout the day's full broadcasts, they appeared later on that evening on Dick Clark's hosted Live Aid show and he only showed each artist doing 1 song of their sets. People lamenting the lack of Zeppelin on the DVD should understand that only half of Stairway to Heaven originally aired anyway. Only Bowie's Rebel Rebel originally aired. On the DVD, you get 3 more songs from him; And only The Who's Won't Get Fooled Again originally aired. Here, you also get Love Reign O'er Me.  <br /> <br />Sound and pictures quality is superior to my VHS copies, though admittedly the sound was a mixed bad from artist to artist. It is what it is.  <br /> <br />So overall this is a worthy set to own whether you have VHS copies or not, as you do get performances that did not air to supplement what you may already have. <br /> <br />One caveat though: 20 years later and Phil Collins reminds us just how annoying he used to be. He was Mr. Overexposure at the time, a perpetual media whore who couldn't get enough radio/screen time in the 80's, and unfortunately none of his appearances were lost. He couldn't just come up and do a few songs himself like every other artist, no, he has to overstay his welcome by first playing in Wembley with Sting, then flying to Philly (all annoyingly captured in footage of him boarding the plane, talking on a headset, landing in Philly, etc), performing a second solo set there, then he sits in with Clapton, sits in with Led Zeppelin. Oh yeah, he's also prominently featured on the Do They Know it's Christmas video too. Even without the Zep performance, you'll grow weary of seeing his stupid Gerber Baby head soon enough.
B00002Z88D|4.0|i think combining the symphony with some of their songs was a good combo, but id prefer to see metallica live than hear them, it just doesnt sound quite right listening to them without the adrenaline of actually being at the concert. good selection of songs though, pick it up if u like metallicas other stuff. id suggest getting this album last to complete ur collection, get all the other stuff first (except st anger)
B000002H70|5.0|Don't even try getting to know these songs by quickly skipping through the disc: this is an album that has to be taken in in 1 sitting, the whole 72 minutes of it. And oh, how much is that worth your precious time. Believe me. <br /> <br />Because I tried. I tried to be too quick with Disintegration. I didn't give it time at first; ending up never knowing what the big deal around the album was. At first, it sounds like one big, muddy pile of plodding goth-rock with heaps of outdated synths. Too long for it's own good. It left me scratching my head about the schizophrenic nature of the album: a handful of their most beautiful singles, sandwiched between these over-long, monotone suites. <br /> <br />Thankfully, there's always that moment that you start checking out the albums in the back of your head again, blow off the dust and give them another spin. After two repeated listenings, my attitude concerning Disintegration completely changed. This is an album with 72-minutes of non-stop, shimmery and subtle beauty. Monotonous and repetitive indeed, but all with a reason. This album is just one big dream. It sucks you in with Plainsong and puts you down gently again after the last few seconds of Untitled. Using words as 'musical trip' may seem cheesy and outdated, but those words seem to have been invented for Disintegration alone. <br /> <br />The repetitive nature of the tracks makes for a totally overwhelming experience. Had Prayers For Rain, The Same Deep Water As You or the title track been edited down to the 3-minute mark, the effect would have been gone. Even tracks that don't seem memorable at first, especially Closedown, gain depth and beauty with every listen, proving themselves as being just as an important part of the album like any other track on Disintegration.  <br /> <br />Forget everything that's been said about Disintegration and it's 'depressing' effect: not meaning to sound arrogant, but this album just isn't depressing at all. 1982's Pornography is depressing. Disintegration is highly emotional and overwhelming, but in a soothing, sometimes even uplifting kind of way. It is a demanding album, as it requires attention from the listener and you may eventually find yourself drowned with the thick atmosphere of the album. Well, just drown yourself. You'll thank me for it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006A9FKA|1.0|To put it simply, this is one of the worst movies ever made.  As a comedy, it never made me laugh, and as a horror movie, it was just like any other stupid zombie flick.  I can't understand why so many people love this film.  It is unbelievably over-stated.  This is not worth even reading about it on the back of the cover at the movie store.  Don't waste your time.
B00004Y5A8|5.0|This is a great package of early bowie material it is a must have to any bowie fan!
7119005901|5.0|Like many other reviewers, the way I first found out about this book was through the Dynasty Warriors video game. I decided to try reading the unabridged version, though somewhat daunted by the size. I did expect the book to be interesting, but I also thought it would be difficult reading. Little did I expect for the book to far exceed my expectations! The Three Kingdoms is a fascinating look into the history (albeit somewhat fictionalized) of China during a roughly 100 year period between 180-280 AD, during which the Han Dynasty fell(the Han was the longest lasting and most powerful dynasty according to the Afterword).  <br /> <br />The book is full of stories of honor, courage, and loyalty; as well as betrayal, cowardice, and deception. Three Kingdoms is not just a book about wars, although battle is featured prominently in the book--it spends equal or greater amounts of time peering into the political intrigue, power-struggles, and military strategy. The book is loaded with characters, which presents probably the greatest challenge to a Western reader. Learning the names of the main characters might come easier than you might think, and there is a helpful list of main characters in the back of the fourth volume (though even many of those listed there appear only momentarily in the novel). I would also suggest reading the foreward and at least the beginning of the afterword in the fourth volume before beginning the book--it will give helpful background information.  <br /> <br />The storytelling in the Three Kingdoms is so compelling that I often found myself practically cheering for my favorite characters, and often laughing out loud at peculiar victories or witty dialogue. The beginning of the book focuses on Liu Bei (Xuande) a man of admirable character and virtue, but often frustrating leadership. The main body of the book deals with Zhuge Liang (Kongming), who is Liu Bei's military strategist. Kongming is definitely the most fascinating character, and his strategies and manipulation are delightful to watch unfold. The book also has scores of heroes and villains, and gives insight into the values and virtues that were highly regarded by the Chinese. Towards the end of the book the storyline briefly begins to sag as most of the main characters die off, and yet the characters Jiang Wei and Deng Ai redeem the end of the book, and still carry on the suspense and excitement that was stronger and brighter in the first 3/4ths of the novel. All in all I was disappointed when I finished, ONLY because there wasn't more to read! I would definitely read this book again and recommend it to anyone who wants to read a true epic of Chinese history.
B00005N83M|3.0|Literally topping the charts upon its arrival and spawning a whopping 6 radio hits (although a few songs had to be remixed before they were truly recognized), 'J. Lo' is fun but fails to prove itself worthy of the praise it has received. Though 'J. Lo''s content is far more danceable than that of 'On The 6' and 'This Is Me...Then', its dance songs are less memorable than those found on the aforementioned albums. Fun, yes, but lacking the same dazzling, energetic spice of, say, \\"Waiting For Tonight.\\" And its Latin-inspired track, the fiery \\"Ain't It Funny,\\" is fairly exhilarating but can't top its forefather \\"Let's Get Loud.\\" Despite all this, I deem 'J. Lo' as Jennifer's best album for the sole reason that it is more consistent in its enjoyable moments than the other two. The album starts off very strong, placing its biggest highlight, the explosive \\"Love Don't Cost A Thing,\\" at the very top of its play-list. A danceable melody, an infectious chorus, excellent production, and even meaningful lyrics (whose excessive slang cause the song to fall short of perfection) make this an instant classic for Miss Lopez. Things dull down significantly come the second track, \\"I'm Real.\\" The bland backing track sounds pitifully low-budget, and the childish lyrics (whose sincerity is highly questionable) also fail to impress. However, its more upbeat sound may provide a worthwhile alternative to those who didn't enjoy the rap-rich remix. \\"Play\\" is an attempted club anthem that is too slow to truly be worth dancing to for long. It is also the first of several songs here in which Jen doesn't sing the chorus. But it is sultrily catchy nonetheless, and I must admit, there is a sort of disturbing, guilty satisfaction I got out of hearing Lopez shout, `play my mutha-f***ing song!' Christina Milian sings the chorus, and also handles hook duty here-I felt a strong sense of irony when I realized Jennifer's presence was unnecessary in \\"Play.\\" \\"Walking On Sunshine\\" is somewhat catchy, but itsovertly feverish techno background can come off as musically offensive at times. \\"Ain't It Funny\\" is one of the very few Latin-influenced songs that I've actually enjoyed-it's quite catchy and also very danceable. Be warned, however, that its heavily Latin sound can become cloying after a few listens-\\"Ain't It Funny\\" is at its best when heard in moderation. \\"Carino\\" wants to be a Latin dance song, but its ho-hum backing track fails to gain momentum over the course of three minutes. The album then delves deep into a sea of filler. \\"Come Over\\" is a moderately catchy slow song, but beyond that there are several uninspired ballads and hokey Spanish songs. Things perk up a tad by track 12, when we hear \\"I'm Gonna Be Alright,\\" whose chorus will likely get stuck in your head-but it falls extremely short of the remix, which I would far sooner recommend. Another one of 'J. Lo''s biggest highlights can be found at its very end-the \\"I'm Real\\" remix featuring Ja Rule, whose edgy pizzazz and smooth, mellow, funky sound is easily able to surpass the original. J. Lo's gentle vocals and Ja Rule's gruff, deep raps work surprisingly well together. All in all, 'J. Lo' certainly has its moments, and though there's nothing truly ground-breaking, it just feels more fun than its predecessor and the utterly useless 'This Is Me...Then.'
B000002B2T|5.0|I've been a die hard AIC fan for a long time now (even though Layne's gone R.I.P.). Well I was up at my local guitar shop picking on an axe when one of the guys who worked there got into a huge conversation with me about Alice in Chains. He started talking about Mad Season and how he thought he and his wife were the only people in the world who love Mad Season. (I doubt that now!) So I went online and checked out \\"River of Deceit\\". I thought it was amazing so I went and picked this CD up. I can't believe that I hadn't heard of Mad Season sooner. Layne was and still is my favorite musician of all time and I think his voice is beautiful and at it's peak on this CD. And the band itself is really talented as well. Mike McCready is good but I still hail Jerry Cantrell as my favorite guitarist. But anyway... some of the best songs off of this cd are \\"River of Deceit; Artificial Red; Long Gone Day; and I'm Above\\". This entire CD is great though and if you think you're a true Layne Staley fan you should definatly buy it. But note, don't expect Alice in Chains. Have an open mind toward the music because it's kind of a big blend of hard rock and blues. But nonetheless it is amazing. Enjoy!
B0006399FS|5.0|Hello all!    After many listenings of this new U2 stuff I can tell that this is an instant classic for me. You can find the sound of The Joshua Tree in it, but it's a completely different thing as well. I admit that it isn't an experimental CD like PoP or Zooropa, but it's a mature fine classical U2 album with great moments and without really weak songs. I think the music charts aren't relevant nowadays, so I don't care if this album is first or last...   Happy new year!  Dani
6305364648|4.0|The thing to remember about \\"True Lies\\" is that you can't take is seriously. With movies like this, you simply have to sit back and enjoy its implausibility. <br />Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Harry Tasker, an agent working for a top-secret government organization called The Omega Sector. His parter Gib (Tom Arnold) is pretty much a slacker and exists only to provide comic relief. Harry's wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) and teenage daughter (Eliza Dushku) think he is a boring computer salesman.  <br />Events occur in which Harry must prevent an Islamic terrorist (Art Malik) from detonating a nuclear bomb on U.S. soil. And, of course, Helen and his daughter become involved. <br />Schwarzenegger is very good in this movie. Tom Arnold's character was hilarious, if not pointless. Curtis excelled as Helen, but the villain was pretty forgetful. Bill Paxton's subplot, while not having much to do with the actual story, was very entertaining. <br />The best thing about \\"True Lies\\" was the action setpieces. From the opening escape to the climatic showdown in a Harrier jet, the action scenes were SPECTACULAR. James Cameron always incorporates eye-popping special effects into his films, and this movie is no exception. The effects got an Oscar nomination, ultimately loosing to \\"Forrest Gump.\\" <br />\\"True Lies\\" is a wildly entertaining action movie. I recommend it. Sure, it may be unbelievable, but how many films really are believable? Not many.
B0002EXH5O|3.0|I loved this album and wore it through several times on tape. I was excited to re-purchase on CD - but these new vocals are pathetic, almost comical in some places. Looks like I wil be buying a used original release. The original was one of the most important metal albums in history....and this is how they treat it?  This should be getting 5 stars
0790734850|5.0|\\"L.A. Confidential\\" was the film that should've won Best Picture in 1997. Instead, \\"Titanic\\" eclipsed it and every other movie that year.  <br />\\"L.A. Confidential\\" is mainly about a trio of detectives in early 1950's Hollywood. They are played by Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, and Guy Pearce. The local police captain (James Cromwell) and most of the other cops are rather corrupt. The three main detectives uncover various things, including a prostitution ring, drugs, blackmail, and murder. Kim Basinger won an Oscar for her role as a high-priced call girl. The plot is actually much more complex than I just described it, so don't take it too seriously. <br />I don't know how to say just how good this movie was. I couldn't find a single flaw with it. It was perfect. The performances, the script, the moody music, the cinematography, the editing, the sets--it all worked. \\"L.A. Confidential\\" is one of my favorite movies, and certainly of the best of the 1990's. The Academy chose \\"Titanic\\" over this? It just proves (once again) how dumb the Oscars really are. <br />If you want to see a perfect film, buy \\"L.A. Confidential.\\"
B0002X314C|5.0|I have been anticipating the release of this album since I saw him perform at Centennial Olympic Park this summer with Kanye West.  His voice is truly unique and his sound is something fresh and different.  John uses his God-given talent to inspire his new audience.  He keeps his soul although he explores different beats which is hard for some artists to do.  I certainly believe that this is a definite CD for the collection.  Thank you John for bringing a new sound to today's mundane music industry.
0783225881|5.0|\\"Field of Dreams\\" very well may be a perfect movie. I don't know anyone who didn't like it. The film's moral message had a profound impact on me. I first saw it when I was a little kid and loved it; I understand and love it even more today. <br />The story is about an Iowa farmer named Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) and his family. Kinsella hears a voice one day while walking in his cornfields. It tells him \\"if you build it, he will come.\\" He interprets it that if he builts a baseball diamond in his cornfield, Shoeless Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta) will appear again. Kinsella proceeds to built it, and magical things begin to happen. <br />I won't go any farther. \\"Field of Dreams\\" is another example of how utterly dumb the Academy Awards are. It lost the Best Picture honor to \\"Driving Miss Daisy.\\" Whatever. Kevin Costner does a great job in the lead role. The script was sublime, and the rest of the acting was as well. James Earl Jones stands out as a reclusive writer, and Burt Lancaster makes an excellent impression in his last film. And pay attention to James Horner's mystical score, especially in the last 10 minutes of the movie. <br />\\"Field of Dreams\\" is the kind of movie you can watch over and over and never get tired of it. At least not me. A real American classic, it's the \\"place where dreams come true.\\"
B0002X314C|5.0|Its Rare that you hear REALLY good music today, I'm young myself, but for me to say other young people think that Usher, Mario, Beyonce,Etc...., and all of those artist are good music, you havent heard anything until you give this album a good listen..Its full of classic soul and will remind you of Alicia Keys \\"Diary\\" Album. This Album deserves more than 5 stars because it is so perfect, and to tell you how perfect it is, is that I really didnt even like \\"I used 2 love you\\", but i KNEW Mr.John Stevens aka John Legend had an incredible voice! This man can sing and put emotions into his music like crazy, he should have went on American Idol, he wouldve been declared the winner before the show got started good, because his voice tone makes it seem like he can sing ANY song.........Outstanding Songs on the Album are: ALL OF THEM, you really can't skip over one once you get addicted to his soulful voice and this comes from a 17 yr old Male man!!!!!!! I know music when I hear it and THIS is it! 100%
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've been listening to green day since dookie and like another of your reviewers I agree it is not as \\"punkish\\" as some of there other works,but I must say I think this is one of the best so far.Like a fine wine green day is getting better all the time. If you like green day at all you should definitely add this one to your collection.
B00005JMAH|1.0|My family and I watched the DVD and noticed that the DVD seemed to omit scenes that were in the theatre release version that we attended. These are the ones we remember in random order: <br />1. At the Quidditch match, Harry sees Sirius in the stands and thinks he's the Grim. <br />2. In the theatre version, the firebolt was received soon after Harry's broom was smashed. Hermione reported the receipt of the broom to McGonagle who confiscated it. <br />3. Harry walking through the tunnel to get to Honeyduke's. <br />4. At the humpbacked witch statue, Nevil passes him and asks him to come help with his homework. Then Snape comes along and tells Harry to go to his dormatory and leaves. <br />5. A scene where Hermione and Ron are at Honeyduke's discussing what to get Harry when they return. <br />6. Harry leaves his invisibility cloak beneath the humpbacked witch. <br />7. Harry and Ron and Hermione are using the invisibility cloak to go to Hagrids to see Hagrid. (Need help on this one because we don't remember all the details.) <br />8. Scabbers bites Ron's hand, and Ron comes out of the invisibility cloak to grab scabbers. Harry and Hermione chase after him beneath the invisibility cloak. They leave the invisibility cloak outside the willow which tips snape off about the cave beneath the willow. <br />9. Snape mentions seeing the Marauders map on Lupin's desk when bringing Lupin his potion. <br />10. Snape loses his Merlin 1st Class award when Fudge discovers Sirius has escaped the tower. <br />11. Snape enters the Shrieking Shack wearing Harry's cloak, in the theater release. In this one, he just walks in. <br />12. Harry visits Snape's office because Malfoy saw Harry's head in Hogsmead, and reported it to Snape. Harry sees Snape's pensive and uses it. He sees his father tormenting Snape as a student, and Lily stopping it. <br />13. Lupin comments on how appropriate it is that Harry's Patronus is a stag since Harry's dad was a animagus.
B00003OSTV|2.0|Somewhere within this Hollywood spectacle is a story about a Roman soldier falling in love with a Christian slave girl. In my quest to review all of the important Biblical epics of the 50s and 60s, this was the ultimate low. I had to break this one up into 3 viewings. Too long, too boring, and much of the acting is weak. You have to be a serious Bible thumper prone to delusions of being persecuted by \\"secular humanists\\" to enjoy \\"Quo Vadis.\\" Remember to ask your viewing partner to wake you up when they crucify Peter . . .
B000024D4R|5.0|There is no reason for giving this album anything less than 5 stars. Really, you can piss off if you're going to tell me how Pink Floyd is a \\"hippie band.\\" Why don't you go crawling back to you radio and hope your favorite Simple Plan song is playing? I know good music is frightening at first (Upon first listen, I didn't like Tool...And Tool kicks ass), but you dumbasses will pull through it eventually.
B000056H24|3.0|Two Jesus film epics in one decade? I can't believe it! 1965's \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told\\" followed 1961's \\"King Of King's\\" with a charismatic performance by Max von Sydow. The film has less of the historical backdrop and plot augmentations as it's predecessor, and seems to aspire towards a more pious adherence to the Gospels (a couple reviews disagreed with that assessment, which surprised me). The shots are more beautiful in my opinion, but I'm not a film major so don't take my word for it. The film seems to lack passion though. It just doesn't move me. The cameos are excessive. Hollywood emphasises stars over acting. What's new? I personally prefer \\"King Of Kings\\" over this, but I think they're about equal in terms of quality. You be the judge.
B0002IU988|5.0|I was a big Creed fan mostly because of Tremonti's Guitar riffs (being a guitarist, a collection of excellent riffs can make an album for me).  When I popped in Alter Bridge's first album I was pleasantly surprised to find that Tremonti's skills have seemingly improved markedly.  Phillips (the drummer) has always sat well with me, and after noticing the deficient bass riffs on Weathred (on which Tremonti filled in for Brian Marshall) I was pleased to see that Marshal returned to the bassist position for Alter Bridge.  The singer that replaced Scott Stapp seems much more capable than Scott and lacks that sometimes annoying accent.  He reminds me mostly of Chris Cornell (of Sound Garden fame) which is welcome.  My only complaints about the vocals are that the lyrics are a tad generic, the new singer (Myles Kennedy) uses his higher range a bit too often (some people may like this).  The lyrical problems I expect were a result of Myles Kennedy signing on after most of the music and vocals were written so I really can't wait to hear their second album.  My only other complaint is that certain portions of the music (usually choruses and acoustic guitar intros) sound a bit too much like generic Creed.  Perhaps I just need to listen again though. <br /> <br />In summary, if you're a fan of intricate guitar work there's a lot to enjoy here.  The singer is very capable although you may want to read over some of the lyrics at their website as they are a bit different from Scott Stapp's lyrics.
0876855575|5.0|Why some other books which we are forced to read in school are considered \\"far superior\\" to this one is above me. Bukowski's sort of autobiographical book \\"Ham on Rye\\" is nothing short of spectacular and holds up amazingly well over time. The reviewer who mentioned that some coming-of-age stories lose their appeal when the reader reaches adulthood couldn't have said it better in my opinion. \\"Ham on Rye\\" is just as effective when you're 17 as it does when you're 35..... <br /> <br />This is an important literary book, regardless of what many literary critics....ahem, hacks....say. Bukowski has many fans and this book is one of the many reasons why. If you have not read \\"Ham on Rye\\" yet, I suggest you do so, and for a more modern coming-of-age story that reminded me of this, check out \\"Little New York Ba$tard.\\" Both books leave a lasting impression.
B00065JTBA|5.0|Great collection of songs for Bon Jovi fans everywhere.  The collection is made up of never before released demo's etc that for whatever reason didn't make the albums at that time. The demo's are well put together &amp; well produced.  Great new song on the collection is &quot;Last Man Standing&quot;.  This box set shows the great flexibility of Bon Jovi &amp; just how much material is left off records but that could have easily been hits individually.  It's a great move by the band to not just fill up a box set with previously recorded music (we all have that already).  It makes this box set well worth the money!
B00000099Y|5.0|I bought this album back in 97 and i still love it to this day. I think that every single song was essential, even the wierd sound effect songs like useful idiot. But i am not a sheep, even though i own all their albums. Unlike some tool fans who agree with everything that Maynard says, i disagree with some things like that religion is all bad. There are some ok things about religion because you can believe in it freely but you shouldnt blindly believe everything that you hear. Some tool fans dont get that message and just listen to maynards every command. But this album is still good.
B001AIRUP4|5.0|In the world of Halloween in a special town called HalloweenTown, the Pumpkin king named Jack Skeleton (Voiced by Chris Sarandon and sung by Danny Elfman) has grown tired of the same old thing year after year. He feels bored as one day he discovers a tree with a door into the world of Christmas as it brightens him up and gives him great ideas to something new and different for once. He decides to give the idea of Christmas to his world and wants to spread joy to many boys and girls with Santa Claus being replaced by him. Unfortunately when Jack thinks he's going good playing Santa to the real world's boys and girls he spreads terror by accident but has to find a way to fix it including saving Santa's life.<br /><br />Co-starring the voices of William Hickey and Catherine O'Hara, this is one of the greatest and most visually stunning animated epics yet. Based on a book and story by Tim Burton, this unique and imaginative animated feature became one of 1993's most critically acclaimed and popular hits that still remains popular to this day. Sure it has spawned merchandise and stuff but this is one of Tim Burton's best movies even though he didn't direct it but produced it and the songs are memorable as hell like \\"What's this?\\" and \\"This is Halloween\\". It's an exciting, dark and funny flick with an original concept and surely one movie that the entire family will enjoy but it's too scary for younger audiences, the animation is brilliant stop-motion and the voice acting is terrific.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Blu-Ray contains brilliant sound and picture that is pitch perfect! the extras are phenomenal such as Trailers, audio commentary, Haunted Mansion/Nightmare Before Christmas tour with on or off triva track, \\"Frankenweenie\\" uncut version with introduction by Tim Burton, Behind The Scenes making of \\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\" documentary, \\"Vincient\\" original short film by Tim Burton, Deleted Scenes, Story-to-film comparision, Blu-Ray exclusive Tim Burton introduction, Original Poem story that inspired the film narrated by Christopher Lee, three featurettes and poster gallery.ory that inspired the film narrated by Christopher Lee, three featurettes and poster gallery.
0671027387|2.0|This was my second try to read Dan Brown. After total failure of Da Vinci Code, I wanted to give him another try. Well this book has even more flaws. It is highly improbable mixture of pseudo scientific guesses and gossip. It is geared toward very low-level commoner who cannot differentiate between fiction and junk. The book lacks real plot, most ideas are absurd and the rest are just a mixture of scientific terms, implausible actions and pathetic conclusions. There is no logic in what characters do, no likable characters; book is very poorly written, action changes place every 5 minutes which makes it very hard to follow the almost non-existent plot line. When you read the book, it makes you think that author is school drop out who found a dictionary and decided to combine few pages of new words together into a book. It is especially laughable when he tries to describe world-renowned scientists and their discussions. He makes them sound like retards that get excited when they follow fifth grade biology. I am shocked at the average good reviews for this book - it just shows the mind set and low level of standards of reading population.
0786915749|2.0|First of all, I have to admit that I'm not an expert on this type of book, \\"fantasy\\" I guess it's called.  I don't read much of it.  But I do love to read, and I like to think I have an open mind, so when it was suggested to me by a friend, I decided to give it a try.  Sometimes when I take suggestions, I end up very pleasantly suprised, like when I read the science fiction novel \\"Ender's Game\\" by Orson Scott Card. NOT THIS TIME.  This book was a waste of my time.  The only thing that kept me reading it was a desire to not disappoint the person who brought the book to my attention.  The plot is okay.  The problem is with the writing.  Is it cliche and tiring.  The same descriptions are used over and over again.  Nothing about any of the characters made me identify with them, and they are grossly underdevoloped.  When I read a book, I want to love the heroes, and hate the bad guys.  I want to cry when the main character hurts.  (That's the point of reading something like this isn't it, to lose reality for a while?)This book didn't evoke any feelings in me, except maybe boredom and slight disgust that this is such a popular series.   Honestly, I think I can write better than the authors of this book.  I can see how it MIGHT be appealing to a young teenager, or someone with the same mindset as a young teenager, OR someone who liked the stories when they were young and is still attached to them for sentimental reasons, but that's about it.  If you're an adult looking for a good read, look somewhere else.  In fact, read Mary Stewart's Merlin series, starting with \\"The Crystal Cave\\".  The story she weaves is hauntingly beautiful, and her writing is amazing.  I think that the series is even considered \\"fantasy\\", if you're stuck in that genre.
0140177396|4.0|I really enjoyed John Steinback's Of Mice and Men for a various amount of reasons. Well for one it was a definite page turner. The relationship the two main characters George and Lennie had just was unbelievable. The fact that George devoted his life for looking after Lennie and his mental disabilities and not knowing what decision George  was going to make for Lennie next just kept me from putting down this book. Not to mention that there is a really excellent hint of foreshadowing in this book maybe even one of the best ever. This book has the perfect example of an unsuspected ending so a person should never put the book down or choose not to read it.
B0002X314C|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS AMAZING FROM START TO FINISH, THIS GUY IS GOING TO DO BIG THINGS THIS YEAR, TO BAD IT CAME OUT AT THE END OF 04, BECUASE 04 DID'T REALLY HAVE A LOT OF GOOD CD'S LIKE THIS, BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOME GOOD OLE SOUL MUSIC YOU HAVE FOUND IT.
B00008G9JO|5.0|When I first bought this disc on LP back in the mid-80's, I expected it to be a decent effort at best. After listening to the album, I was surprised at the seeming lack of reverence for this album. While everyone remembers songs like \\"Aqualung\\" and \\"Locomotive Breath\\" they tend to overlook the song writing maturity and rustic feel of tunes like \\"Heavy Horses\\", \\"Weathercock\\" or, one of my favorites, \\"Acres Wild\\"; a song that invokes, musically, the Scottish Highlands while still sounding fresh and current alongside other late 70's progressive offerings. I'm sure Ian and company could have simply stuck with the same formula that brought us the brilliant Aqualung and Thick As A Brick albums but, as all good forward thinking progressive bands do, they moved on, breaking new ground in the process with each new offering. If you've already explored the obvious Tull tunes and you need to venture further, check out this CD. It definitely holds up and includes the great songs \\"Living In These Hard Times\\" and \\"Broadford Bazaar\\" as bonus tracks. To me, if a collection of songs can make you feel like you've been to Europe when you've hardly been out of the tri-state area, it must be worth listening to.
B00008S2VG|2.0|Madonna hasn't had decent music since 1985. She's  since turned into a drag queen, looking like the relative of the Incredible Hulk. I guess she's been hitting the steroids. There is nothing more unattractive than a woman with unnatural muscles and pronounced veins in her upper arms and forearms. American Life offers nothing more than teeny bopper fare, and overdubbed annoying vocals, by a singer with a pathetic one octave vocal.
B00005QAPK|4.0|Does anyone know whether this new edition contains the English version of the Terence Stamp episode? I would hate to spend $18 and get yet another edition of the foolish Janus Films DVD, with Stamp's powerful performance dubbed into French and then idiotically subtitled in English. <br /> <br />If you know, please respond in the form of an Amazon review. Thanks!
B000784WMW|5.0|I remember watching this movie as a video years ago with my roomate and we loved it!!!  It was one of our favorite movies.  I am really looking forward to seeing it on DVD.  If your a Charotte Bronte fan and liked the book Jane Eyre you are in for a treat.  This drama follows the book very well and the actors/actresses are well cast. Timothy Dalton does an exceptionally brillant job in his role. The chemistry between Timothy Dalton and Jane Eyre is amazing. This is one of those romantic movies that you just want to curl up with good hot chocolate and enjoy.  I highly recommend it.
1592400876|5.0|This book validates my very existence.  Or at least my self-esteem as an English major.  <br /> <br />Despite overly picky quibbles about Lynne's guidelines, this book is marvelous.  Sure, it's ironic that a book that focuses so much on being persnickety about punctuation may in fact have a few errors, but give the woman a break!  She's done more than her share of researching the variants, and it's her lighthearted approach to the whole topic that makes her snappy little book such a winner.  No one would read or care about some tome written by a torpid prescriptive grammarian who expounded at length on comma size and quotation mark placement.  I don't think Lynne ever intended \\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves\\" to be a textbook.  This is not strictly didactic material--it's more of a long-overdue liberation for \\"sticklers,\\" as she calls them.  It is, as Richard Lederer calls it on the dust jacket, a manifesto for those punctilious about punctuation.  Finally--finally!--we have an excuse for being \\"unattractive know-all obsessives who get things out of proportion and are in continual peril of being disowned by our exasperated families\\" (5).  Thank you, Lynne, from the bottom of our semicolon-adoring hearts.

038572179X|5.0|Can we rewrite our history? So that separated lovers end up together? So that we are forgiven our sins? So that we are understood our motivations? Is atonement even possible? These questions are at the core of Ian McEwan's brilliant book Atonement. I am probably the last person on the globe to read this book but I would like to add myself to its list of fans anyway.  <br /> <br />Presented in three acts with an afterward, the plot is played out before us-delivered to us by the hands of Briony Tallis. In the beginning, she sets the stage, changes the course of fate and in the end she remains the puppet master. Of course, it is also the story of Robbie and Cee but they are more her characters through which we see the failings (and as she rewrites them, successes) of her life. In the end, it is not so much the tale of star-crossed lovers as it is story of the artist as a young woman. <br /> <br />Beautifully, richly told this book never stops surprising. Just when you think you have it all figured out, everything changes. Just as you believe that everything is going to be all right, that fulfillment is near-something else happens. In the end, atonement for Briony is as much a dream, a fable as Briony's Trials of Arabella--possible but not real:  <br /> <br />\\"How can a novelist achieve atonement when, with her absolute power of deciding outcomes, she is also God? There is no one, no entity or higher form that she can appeal to, or be reconciled with, or that can forgive her. There is nothing outside her. In her imagination she has set the limits and the terms. No atonement for God, or novelists, even if they are atheists. It was always an impossible task, and that was precisely the point. The attempt was all.\\" <br />

B00063EMJ6|5.0|I think this is a great compilation for a Neil Young fan, which I am. People are complaining \\"this just isn't enough\\" and \\"just buy Decade\\", well I didn't want to pay a rediculous $29.99 for Decade, so this is great for me!!! I've wanted a Neil Young compilation for some time but couldn't bring myself to purchase Decade simply for the price of the set. I consider myself a Neil Young fan and if you do as well but don't want to go out and buy all the albums or Decade, just for the money factor, this is a compilation for you.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|I don't think anyone on the planet has waited for this, and hoped for this, longer and more than I have. This is my Star Wars, this is my Lord of the Rings.

It made me want to think, like nothing ever before or after.
B00003CX9E|4.0|Citizen Kane is regarded as one of the best American movies of all time, if not the best.  After seeing it for the first time, at first I couldn't quite see why.  Sure, it featured innovative technology for its time, but these innovations go largely unnoticed by all except film historians.  And sure, it is clever at times.  And it does seem to bring a powerful message about a man's lust for power and satisfaction in material things, a fruitless quest which ends in emptiness and misery.  I suppose it is brutally honest in showing how a man's idols can fail him, but there is no note of hope or redemption.  But perhaps this is the kind of movie that classifies as art instead of entertainment, and bears the most rewards on multiple viewings.<br /><br />The story-line begins with the death of the wealthy media magnate Charles Foster Kane (modeled somewhat after William Randolph Hearst, who fought to prevent the film from being shown).  Appropriately, it is up to journalists to tell his story, and in their quest to summarize his life, a reporter searches for the significance of his dying word, \\"Rosebud\\".  The quest is not successful, but this is a clever device to present Kane's life as the fruit of media inquiry, with interviews and flashbacks.  *Spoiler* The final scene does solve the mystery, where it becomes evident that Rosebud is the name of the snow sled from Kane's childhood.  Kane was taken from his mother as a young boy, and entrusted into the custody of a rich industrialist, leaving his family in order to embark on his quest for greatness and power.  This pursuit resulted in the accumulation of many worldly goods, but no happiness.  As others have pointed out, the tragedy of Kane's life illustrates the truth of what the Bible says in Mark 8:36 \\"For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul?\\" On this level \\"Citizen Kane\\" is a powerful movie with deep symbolism, showing how a man deprived of love from childhood is given money and power, but enters the depths of despair when he finds that it can't buy love or happiness.<br /><br />Certainly this is a message worth hearing, especially in a world where many put their hope in riches and power.  But while \\"Citizen Kane\\" shows us the emptiness of Kane's life, it offers no alternative.  Like the book of Ecclesiastes, the pursuit of Kane's happiness in earthly things ends only in misery, meaningless, and a vanity of vanities.  But unlike the Bible book, the films concludes with a tragic finale with no sense of hope.  Citizen Kane is brilliant in showing the emptiness of life lived apart from God, but in the end it is a dark movie where the light of the gospel is absent.  It has to be admitted that Kane's life is not a pretty picture, and the tragedy of his life is neither pleasant nor entertaining.  If you're looking for entertainment, don't watch Citizen Kane.  But if you're looking for art with a powerful message and don't mind the absence of a final note of hope, look no further than Citizen Kane. -GODLY GADFLYnd power, but enters the depths of despair when he finds that it can't buy love or happiness.<br /><br />Certainly this is a message worth hearing, especially in a world where many put their hope in riches and power.

B00066N8JS|5.0|I have been a big fan of NIN since pretty hate machine fist came out.  Out of all of NIN albums TDS is by far my favorite.  The deluxe edition is alone worth purchasing for the second cd of b-sides and demos.  All NIN fans should go out right now and buy this record.  Great Album.
B00006WKY9|5.0|I always had LOVE AT FIRST STING from these guys and listened to that alot, but TAKEN BY FORCE really made me love this band, it was this album that showed me the genius of the Scorpions. TAKEN BY FORCE is my favorite hardrock album now, i'v had it for about a year and listen to it all the time. I really think that the 70's Scorpions with Roth completely blows away the MTV scorpions of the 80's, for one thing, the music was more complex with albums like VIRGIN KILLER and TAKEN BY FORCE and more sincere instead of the \\"love,sex,fun,get laid\\" foolishness of there \\"succsesful\\" 80's albums. Every track is amazing, this album is a work of art and i can't name favorites, but Uli's guitar playing is unmatched, the greatest guitar player to ever walk the earth!
0061020680|5.0|\\"Mort\\" describes what I would consider to be an accurate description of the reaction that any fifteen year old boy would have if Death showed up to offer apprenticeship to him.  <br />This book, although shorter than most Discworld books, is a good one to start with, being easy to understand and full of Terry Pratchett's signature humor. It also follows the classic, feudally romantic 'boy vs. girl' relationship between Mort and Death's adopted daughter, Ysabell. <br />I would recommend this to anyone new to the Discworld series. It is fun to read, full of likeable characters, and at times full of fast-paced action, mingled with humor.
B0000028RR|5.0|This is one of the greatest records ever recorded.<br /><br />  From the opening notes of the first track (\\"Bombtrack\\"), to the bone chilling lines of the final song (\\"Freedom\\"), this was an album that got in your face and pummeled you with its' message. Rage Against The Machine has something to say here, and they are demanding that you listen. With singer Zach De La Rocha delivering a guttural \\"Ugh!\\" that hits you square in the face on just about every track, and lyrics that play out as the soundtrack to a revolution, Rage became a force musically, as well as politically.<br /><br />  For a band that envisioned themselves more as political activists, with being musicians taking on a secondary role, these are legendary musical performances. Guitarist Tom Morello, a Harvard grad, lays down one of the most innovative and stylish performances in Rock history. His grinding, bleeping, squealing, screaming guitar parts were something that had never been done in the Hard Rock genre before. Sounding like some sort of erratic malfunctioning machine, he assembled all of the aforementioned sounds into a steel spine for his band to stand tall and firm.<br /><br />  This is one of the greatest guitar performances ever recorded.<br /><br />  While Morello's axe is ranting, Rage's rhythm section is pounding out a foundation of power funk. Drummer Brad Wilk and bassist Timmy C. lay the groundwork for the powerful core that is the essence of Rage Against The Machine. This is the nucleus of their sound. Every other element revolves around the perfect base that is built by these two phenomenal players. With Morello's guitar style being one that is more of an accent to the overall sound, it opens the door for the funky thumping of this amazing rhythm section to become the main focus. Listen to the groove they throw down on \\"Bombtrack\\", \\"Take The Power Back\\" and \\"Wake Up\\".<br /><br />  Wow.<br /><br />  This is one of the greatest rhythm section performances ever recorded.<br /><br />  And then there's the voice. It's a furious, pissed off Zach De La Rocha that is swinging the revolutionary bat here, and he's a real slugger. His vocals are revolutionary, plain and simple. Screaming out his social and political views on each and every song, he gets right in your face. The aggression and intensity is unparalleled. Ranting like the forgotten ghetto son of urban America, we hear themes of racism, police brutality, and international war. Much like Bob Marley was a revolutionary voice for his generation and its' injustices, De La Rocha screams his opinions and pleas for rebellion.<br /><br />  This is one of the most intense, and inspired, vocal performances ever recorded.<br /><br />  Now we come to the purpose of this record, the lyrics. I would love to list a few for you here, but there is just not enough room. The power of the instrumentation is magnified and amplified by this powerful lyrical content. This was a band on a mission. A powerful voice of anger, freedom, justice, racism, equality........you name it. They were making their statement here, without being \\"preachy\\". If it's one thing I hate, it's \\"preachy\\". They're not asking that you believe what they believe, they're getting right in your face and telling you they are going to change things, with or without your help! A true revolutionary recording.<br /><br />  This is one of the greatest records ever recorded.recorded. <br />  <br />      And then there's the voice.

B0006A9FKA|4.0|Great little movie... the laughs don't dilute the scares and the scares don't dilute the laughs.  Also, instead of having a bunch of quickly-sketched characters (the brave guy, the smart-ass guy, the cynical guy, the cowardly guy, etc.) like a lot of horror movies, this one delivers a nice little group of nicely-drawn, multi-faceted characters.  And, again, that extra detail doesn't dilute the scares.  In fact, the scary and tragic scenes come off as especially scary and tragic because we get to know and like the characters involved in them.  A nice sharp picture, great sound, and generous extras round out this must-see DVD.
B0006A9FKA|2.0|Count me as one of those comedy zombies who \\"just don't get it.\\"  While I'm generally a fan of British flicks, this has to be one of the worse ones I've seen.  The story is extremely predictable, the acting second-class, and the zombies are just not that attractive.  I could barely sit through the movie -- even with fastforwarding!
B0002XNSY0|5.0|There is little that can be said about this film that hasn't been already.  A mad brig. general (Sterling Hayden) sends his fleet of loaded B-52 bombers (one commandeered by Slim Pickens) to attack their targets inside Russia while the President (Peter Sellers) and a hardcore anti-commie general (George C. Scott) fight over an attempt to stop them amid 'statistically acceptable' losses.    That's a pretty dry summary to what is definitely one of the darkest comedies ever to come out of the Cold War, especially when you consider the time in which is was made, and one of the AFI's best 100 films.    World War III was definite possibility during the Cuban Missle Crisis in 1963.  It's hard for anyone born after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of Communist Russia to fathom just how tense relations were between the U.S. and Russia back then, right through to the Reagan years.  That's what makes this film both so absurd and terrifying.  The comedy of Peter Sellers' scenes (as President Muffley, Dr. Strangelove and Group Captain Mandrake) set against the documentary-style assault footage of the barracaded army base and Slim Pickens/James Earl Jones-et al's straight-played cockpit scenes (plus the use of stock footage at the beginning and end of the picture) show two definitions of the absurdity of war. With characters named Turgidson, Premiere Kissoff, Col 'Bat' Guano, General Jack Ripper, Major 'King' Kong and President Merkin Muffley, there is a warped sense of humour within the madness.    Sellers' performances, along with those of Pickens, Scott, Hayden and several others are legendary in this film.  You owe it to yourself to (at the very least) see this film as a rental, but you will find yourself buying it at some point after that.
6302453356|2.0|When our son was about 7, he received this movie as a gift, and watched it pretty frequently.  The other day it occurred to me, as the now 10-year-old boy was watching some movie, that he hadn't pulled \\"Hook\\" out of its case in about 2 years or so.  I was finally able to put a finger on what had always annoyed me about this movie --- it is the sort of movie that an 8-year-old would produce, given an appropriate budget.<br /><br />The sets are pretty spectacular, but seem to be an end in and of themselves.  The presentation is simply relentless, and seems more focused on launching an all-out assault on the senses of the hapless movie viewer.  Lost in all the hubbub & spectacle is a coherent plot.  Apparently, the surface details are more important than a storyline, decent performances, etc.  I doubt our son will be watching this anymore, and for this I am grateful.
B00003CWOL|3.0|\\"Dogma\\" is a movie that ought to offend my religious sensibilities, but, oddly, I find it to be a most religious movie. Long on deep theological questions and religious craving, but woefully short on theological sophistication or even basic knowledge, writer/director Kevin Smith has created a smart, hip movie that is emblematic of all that is right and wrong with religion today -- especially Smith's own Roman Catholicism.<br /><br />Smith has to be commended on the all-star cast he assembled for this flick: Damon, Affleck, Fiorentino, Garafalo, Carlin, Rock, Hayek and Rickman. Each delivers an impassioned and believable performance in his most bizarre of plot lines. The plot? Two renegade angels, banished for millennia from Heaven, have found a loophole back into Paradise. Problem is, if they exercise it, they will have contradicted the infallibility of God, bringing existence itself to an end. God, meanwhile, on one of his monthly skeeballing forays as a human, has been waylaid by a triplet of hockey-stick wielding, hellish thugs, and lies comatose in a New Jersey hospital. Saving the universe is in the hands of an unlikely bunch: an abortion clinic worker, the \\"13th Apostle,\\" a pair of sex-obsessed, slacker \\"prophets,\\" a stripper muse and a cynical, angelic mouthpiece of God.<br /><br />While juvenile in places (the climactic fight sequences seems to have been choreographed by 5th graders) the film is full of the holy longing that many in our time feel is missing from religion. Missing? Not really. Misplaced? Definitely. Disappointed with the spirituality of the Roman Catholic Church, director Smith has gone off into the desert of contemporary society to find the building blocks of a faith he can believe in. That his theology and ecclesiology are way off the road (Christ is not a separate person from God; shooting off angels' wings won't make them human; the pope would never sanction replacing the crucifix) is hardly the point. A longing for authentic religious experience and a desire for communication with a benevolent deity *are.*<br /><br />For those who see \\"Dogma\\" as a mature expression of the state of Christianity today, I say, \\"Please, take another look.\\" For those on the inside, let \\"Dogma\\" be a window into the half-baked beliefs and longings of those who don't come to Church on Sunday. For all, I say, listen long and hard to Alanis Morissette's exquisite and soul-stirring \\"Still\\" that plays over the credits at the end. Wow!esire for communication with a benevolent deity *are.*    For those who see \\"Dogma\\" as a mature expression of the state of Christianity today, I say, \\"Please, take another look.\\" For those on the inside, let \\"Dogma\\" be a window into the half-baked beliefs and longings of those who don't come to Church on Sunday.

B00005JN2Z|4.0|Tom Cruise plays the part of Vincent, a hired assassin assigned to kill five people before the night is over.  Vincent hires Max, a cab driver, to drive him around town for his contract killings.  Vincent asks Max to drive him to an inner-city apartment; after getting there, Vincent then offers Max a deal: if he waits for him, Vincent will pay Max over $600.<br /><br />This is probably where Max makes the biggest mistake -- he accepts by waiting.  It is a contractual agreement that Max will likely regret.<br /><br />The setting of the movie is mostly in Downtown Los Angeles.  The scenes are done remarkably well.  It is a violent movie.  Nothing is left to the imagination.<br /><br />The creators of the movie did a remarkably good job in character development in the beginning of the movie.  Although some might think it's dull, it really shapes the character of who the individuals are in the movie, including the prosecutor, Max, and Vincent.<br /><br />Overall, a fairly well done movie.  It's worth seeing once.<br /><br />Michael
B000001EXR|4.0|\\"Carnival Of Souls\\" is a very good album but it is different from other Kiss albums. This album is a grudge rock album but it's really good. Here's What I think of the songs. <br /> <br />Hate- Great opener. Good lyrics and tune. <br /> <br />Rain- Try to remember what Hate sounded like. Most of these songs sound the same. Anyways, good song. Paul sings this one. <br /> <br />Master And Slave- One of the best songs off of the album.  <br /> <br />Childhood's End- Great Song with powerful lyrics and killer bass licks. <br /> <br />Jungle- Not one of the best but good song,. <br /> <br />In My Head- Great vocals by Paul. Cool lyrics. <br /> <br />It Never Goes Away- Very unmemorble but try to like it. <br /> <br />Seduction Of The Innocent- Remember \\"Not For The Innocent\\" from Lick It Up? Weird! <br /> <br />I Confess- Good lyrics and Gene sings. <br /> <br />In The Mirror- Good song. Don't remember how it goes. <br /> <br />I Walk Alone- Great song and for first and only time, BRUCE KULICK SINGS! <br /> <br />\\"Carnival Of Souls\\" is a very good album and I would buy it.
076790592X|5.0|After recently reading The Five People You Meet In Heaven and watching the movie, I decided I had to read Tuesdays With Morrie. Even though the reader knows what the ending will be, you still can't help shedding some tears.  <br />   Although death is a difficult subject to talk about for some, I found this book very helpful. I learned to not take everything for granted and to focus on the important things in life. Being a teacher, I hope I can someday have the kind of impact Morrie had on his students. Thanks Mitch, for sharing your powerful and inspirational story.
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|\\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" is a high-octane thriller about an amnesiac retired CIA hitman who is brought in from the cold by opposing elements who want to frame him for a killing he didn't commit.  The film contains alot of globehopping cat-and-mouse intrigue, thriling action setpieces and one crackerjack carchase.  Besides Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, the film offers Joan Allen, Brian Cox, and Julia Stiles in supporting roles.  What this densely plotted film does not offer is any deep character development for the actors to work with.  This film is the equivalent of fast food;easy to digest but eminently forgettable.  It's no coincidence that this film was initially released during the dog days of Summer when the mind does not need to ponder weighty issues.  That doesn't mean that a movie has to be this lightweight.
B00004W52U|5.0|Operation Ivy are one of the most important bands in the late '80s punk scene. Famous for starting ska-punk and for having two members of Rancid, this collection covers most of their material: The Energy album, the Hectic ep, and two cuts from a comp series. <br /> <br />ENERGY: Easily Operation Ivy's best work, this album is a nice collection of punk songs, with some ska (\\"Take Warning\\", \\"Badtown\\") thrown in. Excellent album. <br />Best songs: \\"Jaded\\", \\"The Crowd\\", \\"Big City\\", \\"Missionary\\". <br /> <br />HECTIC: A legendary ep, what can I say? Less ska, more punk, and a helluva lot of greatness. <br />Best Songs: \\"Junkies Running Dry\\", \\"Healthy Body\\" <br /> <br />So buy this cd now If you like punk. If you like this cd, than check out Choking Victim, Rancid, and the Voodoo Glow Skulls. If you dont, you're probably a pretentious retard who listens to Yes.
B00006RINF|3.0|I liked this CD pretty well. I bought it on a whim because I kept hearing how comparable they are to Evanescence. I am a huge Evanescence fan, so I thought what the heck, I need something to hold me over until their new album. The songs are decent, but the lyrics seem to lack the maturity and profoundness of Evanescence's.
6304277210|5.0|I wish she had come out with this method a couple of decades ago, and I could have enjoyed playing piano all along. I don't have 10 years of time to study in order to be able to play basic two handed songs. This was amazing. I really was able to play in such a short time. She was very clear and easy to understand. Even if you are taking regular piano lessons, a little instant gratification can sure help to motivate! Highly recommend!
B0002OERI0|4.0|I've seen this album performed live in almost its entirety as well, so that may inform this review just a little bit.  This is a solid piece of work by Green Day.  The production is outstanding, that is this is the best-sounding album to date.  The band sounds huge, and the title track hits you right in the gut.  The songwriting,is incredibly tight, even the two 9-minute \\"suites\\" work, for the most part (Green Day pulls them off live quite well too-no, I didn't think they could do it either).  Also, I don't think the band has ever worn its infuences on its sleeve quite like this before:  track 13 \\"Extraordinary Girl\\" wouldn't sound out of place on a Kinks, Zombies, or Yardbirds album (Green Day has always hinted at a British Invasion influence, their version of \\"So Tired\\" being the most obvious)  What doesn't work:  I never got the \\"rock opera\\" sense from the album - there doesn't really feel like much of a story there, even after reading the lyrics, and the characters of \\"St Jimmy\\" \\"WhatsHerName\\" and \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" just feel like, stereotypes.  It's tough to buy into a record about \\"punk rock revolution\\" when it doesn't seem like the characters _do_ much of anything.  Either way, this album is still rock solid and definitely a step up for the band, this hasn't left my stereo once since it came out.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Napolean Dynamite is the sleeper hit of the year.  <br /> <br />A tale of an absurdly unpopular kid named Napolean Dynamite who lives around losers; his brother who spends his entire time on the internet chatting with his \\"girlfriend\\" who he has never met in person, his uncle who hasn't got over the loss of a football career 20 years past and shoots himself on camera throwing some lousy passes, his grandmother who goes on motorcycle ventures, a girl interest who has a pony tail on one side of her head, and a friend named Pedro who does not speak good english and goes out 'building' cakes for girls he wants to ask out to the dance and later runs for class president against the most popular blonde in the school. Pretty much, all the characters in Napolean are wierdos! But that's what makes them likable, and that's what makes the viewer not take the movie seriously and just laugh it away.  <br />However, the movie does end with a nice resolution for all the characters' deficiencies. The movie wraps with the class presidential campaign where Napolean gives his remarkable dance and blows everybody away! <br /> <br />All the actors in the movie are unknown or just not famous. This movie will change that for most of them including John Heder, who plays Napolean. <br /> <br />You know what, just watch this movie already, Gosh!!! <br /> <br />B+ <br /> <br />
B0006A9FMI|2.0|The info that Amazon lists is incorrect.  There are English subtitles but the dialogue is only in Japanese.  I agree with the first review - I hate subtitles.  If I wanted to read something, I'd be reading the manga.  You will miss half of the scenes because you'll be trying to read the subtitles (and there are a lot of philosophical discussions in this movie so plan to read a lot).<BR>This is a good movie but if you actually want to watch it, instead of occasionaly glancing at the screen when you aren't reading, then wait for the dubbed version which will probably be released sometime in the future.  And most dubbed videos offer the option of subtitles.  All in all I have no idea why the put this out without dubbing AND subtitles.  I presume to make more money with a dubbed only edition in the future.
B0002858YS|5.0|There is not one song on this album that you could possibly stand to skip. <br />Admittedly, the stand out songs probably are the 3 singles, but every other song has something in particular of its own which makes it special. <br />On Top, my personal favourite, has some gorgeously written lyrics, and the whole rest of the album is so fantastically put together that there can be no denying how good this is. <br />The best thing about 'Hot Fuss' is that, with all the debuts being released this year, in the same way as Razorlight, no other band sounds anything like The Killers. <br />This album is a must have, a soon to be classic.
B00005JMYI|4.0|I'm sure we have all wondered what exactly goes in the offices of our local news stations. And what exactly do they say to each other when they break for commercial and we can't hear what they say?. Or when it's over and the credits roll?. Well, we find out here, and it's one of a number of deliriously silly and funny moments that fill up this goofy, but funny satire. Will Ferrell, who can do no wrong by this reviewer, continues his streak of making funny, enjoyable little pieces of comedy fluff. This is probably his most inspired creation so far. The film is narrated by Bill Kurtis, an A&E staple who hosts such shows as \\"Cold Case Files\\", and \\"American Justice\\". Will plays Ron Burgundy, a local 1970's anchorman in San Diego(or San Diago as he has called it), who seems to be riding high on all fronts. He is an insanely childish and pompous, and the lights are pretty dim in that well coiffed melon of his. He's treated like an important celebrity(or at least he think he is)and he is living the high life. Along with his buddies. Champ Kind(David Koechner), is the cowboy hat wearing sports guy, and has an unhealthy interest in Ron. Roving reporter Brian Fontana(Paul Rudd), is the big mustached ladies man. And then there is weatherman Brick Tamland(the hilarious Steve Carrel), a simpleton who has been declared \\"mentally retarded\\". The guys' male dominated lifestyle and world is shaken up when the station hires Veronica Corningstone(Christina Applegate), a hot young lady who aspires to be a top anchor herself, and throwing a wrench in what the men, and life at that time in general, thought of as an \\"only men\\" kind of thing. A time when women didn't have the power they have now. When they were assistants or secreteries, and were seldom seen, and heard even less. As the movie shows it as being. Once she arrives, the comedy really kicks in, especially when the two result to petty pranks and name calling to make it to the top. The always great Fred Willard co-stars as the station's boss. There is no great plot or meaning here, except for Will and the gang to have fun with their characters and make a silly little comedy that is only meant for pure fun and entertainment. They succeeded. It is no surprise that Applegate is funny and holds her own. She practically comes from an entire life of comedy, and her ditzy work as Kelly Bundy on \\"Married With Children\\" was an inspired bit of comedy buffoonery acting, and was not appreciated in the right way. She has come a long way from that role with tons of other parts since then. Ferrell is the kind of comedian who will just jump right in there and do it. No matter what. Burgundy can get a bit tiring after a while, but he is always ready to pull you back in with a funny line or scene. Carrel, as Brick, gets the most laughs here. There is a great scene where our reporters are confronted by the other channel's news teams in a hilarious \\"battle\\" scene. The moment is only made better because of the cameo appearances from stars who plays the other top anchors. I won't say who. That will spoil the fun. The design of the film works real well and has that 70's look and vibe, and the outfits and facial hair are hysterical. As is the use of The Starlight Vocal Band's hit, \\"Afternoon Delight\\". The DVD claims it is the unrated, unedited version, but I never saw the original theatrical release, so I couldn't tell you what is newly put in and what is there. The special features are a delight. There are bloopers, which can also be found during the end credits, and outtakes, and lots more. Plus a hilarious video of the already mentioned song above. Bill Kurtis himself appears in a feature that has him having a 10 minute talk with Ron Burgundy. All in all, it's a riotously silly and cheeseball comedy that will leave you with nothing more than a smile on your face and the knowing that you saw a completely mindless film that only wanted to have fun for an hour and a half. And what fun it is.
B0002MB7R6|3.0|The ultimate disaster movie, The Day After Tomorrow depicts a change in climate that sweeps the globe and triggers a modern ice age. An original premise long overdue for cinematic treatment, it offers astonishing and eerie imagery: multiple tornadoes whipping across Los Angeles, an arctic depression over Scotland freezing all beings in an instant, a tidal surge engulfing Manhattan, and flocks of birds flying south for the summer.<br />Director Roland Emmerich (who thrilled audiences with 1996s Independence Day) clearly delights in scenes of mass destruction. Artfully crafted, these successive calamities come one after another with but a handful of humorous moments to break the tension.<br />At the centre of the story is Jack Hall, a paleoclimatologist studying the effects of global warming. His chilling theories are ignored by government officials - a plot point that is all too common in such films - even as the world is ravaged by extreme weather conditions. And after the northern hemisphere is encircled by frigid storms, Hall must journey from Washington to New York to rescue his teenaged son, Sam.<br />Though such an Armageddon would take a couple of centuries to evolve (barring a shift of the earths magnetic axis), the film compresses developments into just a few days. Thankfully, the scientific interpretations are presented clearly and logically without getting buried in technical jargon.<br />Like Independence Day, Emmerich (who co-wrote the screenplay with Jeffrey Nachmanoff) plunges headfirst into the storyline, and populates the film with an enormous number of characters. But they all react rather placidly to the shocking events, with little hysteria or emotion - their hearts seem as cold and unfeeling as the eventual all-consuming blizzard. With the shocking proceedings presented as more fun than grim, any sense of tragedy seems to have been sucked into an atmospheric vortex.<br />The first half of the film also seems disjointed, as if numerous consequential scenes were deleted in favour of a pointless subplot about a pediatric cancer patient. It is only once the glacial onslaught has begun that the story becomes dramatic and energized, with plenty of surprises and innovative scenes of suspense.<br />Dennis Quaid is believable and competent as the dedicated Hall, while Jake Gyllenhaal is charming as the determined Sam. Relative newcomer Emmy Rossum, as Sams love interest, lights up the screen; this neophyte is a star in the making. (Watch for her later this year as Christine in the film version of Andrew Lloyd Webbers The Phantom of the Opera.)<br />The Day After Tomorrow is a fascinating and refreshing film that does without the standard elements of most big-budget Hollywood productions. While it lacks the intensity and excitement of Independence Day, it is a tribute to mans will to survive, demonstrating how remarkably adaptive our species can be. Rating: 7 out of 10.
B000002LCK|4.0|New Order can put me in a good mood any time; and when I want New Order, this is the album to put in. It has almost all, in my opinion, of their best stuff; and the b-sides are almost all good too. If you want to feel some nostalgia, or just move your feet, this is for you!
B000001ESP|4.0|A quick note to Mr. Rat Scabies - I've been a Rush fan from the beginning and I'm a GIRL!!!  So were quite a few of the girls I went to high school with.

B000002HJD|5.0|Don't buy / listen to American Prayer expecting a continuation of the Doors earlier collaborations. Musically, the remaining members of the Doors follow a logical progression of their craft, but their efforts only serve as a backdrop for Jim Morrison's poetry. The music is secondary, as it should be, but serves to cultivate a softer seduction for those who would be unable to give themselves over completely to Morrison's lyrical constructions alone. I've read several reviews here that denigrate Morrison's poetical efforts. Quite simply, the writers of such reviews cannot wrap their minds around the subject matter. Morrison's work is not for the intellectually deficient or those who cannot deconstruct its symbolism. There are common themes throughout this album, as well as several tracks from previous albums. It certainly transcends pop music and would hold the same value without accompaniment. It is Thanatos against Eros, it is tragedy, it is copulation. It is Anarchical, not nihilistic. Ultimately, it is realization; of flesh, of God, of the consumerism and material centered culture of the modern world, which holds us all in an eternal check - money beats soul - and ultimately destroys free will and spirituality. The longing for a better way, an existence that is much more pure was evident in Morrison's art. He asked often for us to join him. Few understood or listened. And, ultimately a few grains are no match for the unforgiving grindstone. For a better understanding of the psychology of Morrison's art I suggest reading \\"The Birth of Tragedy\\" - Nietszche, \\"Symbols of Transformation\\" - Carl Jung, and \\"Life Against Death\\" - Norman O. Brown.
0131103628|5.0|For all those people excited to learn programming, and especially C programming, who are looking for a good introductory text...stop here.  Seriously..do not even consider another C book until after you have thoroughly read this one..(trust me it will only take a week anyhow).  This book known simply as \\"K&R\\" is the standard, and I can say that on the basis that they created the language.  This book touches on the differences between 'Standard' C and 'ANSI' C quite well, also a topic you should know as a programmer...standards.   Anyway, this book is extremely short, but packs a huge amount of information about the language, here's a secret C isn't very big at all.  Any aspiring programmer should stop and read this text before they move on to any other topics, just learn the language first, then you can introduce yourself to the creative ways to use the language.

0743454529|5.0|I noticed that a great many reviewers did not like the ending, yet I feel that the ending does not detract from this touching novel. In fact, the ending symbolizes lost chances (for all characters), the unlived life, and the pain that comes from not being able to show someone how you feel before it is too late. With all of the focus on one child, the other is only considered too late.
B000068QY7|5.0|Oasis is back after two averages albums but this one bring them back to the 90's where their music was great and this album bring them back. opening whith the hindu times which is a rocking song in years and the album includes the great ballad \\"stop crying your heart out\\" and the touchy song \\"songbird\\" which eas written by liam .THis album is awsome.
B0002BO0US|5.0|Found this album at a garage sale when I was 10, fell in love with it, & now years later am thrilled to find that it exceeds even my youthful enthusiasm. I've never before been moved to write a review on this site before, but this album is the exception (I'm listening to it as I type). Think about a \\"Something Else\\" -era Kinks infused with \\"Carrie Anne\\"ish Hollies vocal harmonies and \\"Ummagumma\\"-era Pink Floyd production values and you'd be starting on the right track - but there's so much more to \\"Odyssey\\" than that. \\"Time of the Season\\" is the radio track, of course, but a moody masterpiece like \\"Beechwood Park\\" and the immense, spacious, otherworldly \\"Hung Up On A Dream\\" actually put it to shame. Apart from the dreadful \\"Butcher's Tale,\\" there isn't a bad cut in the bunch - and you can hear threads of the remainder of the disc woven throughout rock history from '67 onward. \\"Influential\\" doesn't begin to describe the impact of this disc; basically, the entire history of '60s britpop is rewritten in the course of 40 minutes by this sadly underrated band. \\"Odyssey\\" also benefits from seeming somehow timeless - despite some incredibly naive lyrics (to 21st-century ears) this is incredibly forward-looking music. And still, it oozes late-'60s England with every chord. And just _try_ to play along with it...never has sophistication so moved you to snap your fingers...
0393057658|5.0|Any baseball fan must read this book.  It's the story of former super-prospect and current super-GM Billy Beane, the low-budget but successful Oakland A's, and one interesting but not transcendent 2002 season, but it's not about the man or the team or the season.  It's a basic philosophy that seems intuitive but is practiced too infrequently:  a GM must seek out what is undervalued in the baseball market.  So this is all about finding out what is valuable in baseball, defining this great game and what makes a good player.  Sabermetrician or not, whether or not you agree, this book should be read by every baseball fan.
B00066N8JS|3.0|I enjoy listening to this cd every so often but know that its a delux edition with exra tracks theres more reason to get this bad boy.Now I also recomend you pick up my favorite NIN cd, pretty hate machine, thats a classic.Also if your into this kind of sound I have others to recomend also like, earlier Maralyn manson cd's , my all time favorite SAMHAIN ( glenn danzigs band after the demise of the Misfits), Skinny puppy, Ministry and even romstien(sp) ?.<br />Anyway I highly suggest you pick up any SAMHAIN cd, tape or original vinal you can get your hands on.Its a mix of punk-NIN type synth ( they were influenced by Samhain) and hard rockin power cords that will ingulf you with gritty sound and the best lyrical genious ever Glenn Danzig.
B0006GQMC8|5.0|A true \\"sleeper\\" film that utilizes to the utmost, the \\"tough guy\\" talents of Charles Bronson and Lee Marvin.  It's 1931 and Albert Johnson (Bronson) is a man wrongly accused of murder in the untamed Yukon territory. He is an expert hunter/trapper and can survive in the most extreme weather & temperatures. Marvin plays a grizzled old Canadian Mountie, Sgt. Edgar Millen, who's just as tough and not to be messed with! When a group of low-life fur trappers try to make trouble and take on Johnson, they find out too late... they messed with the wrong guy. Then they go and lie to Millen - saying Johnson murdered one of them. Millen knows the reality but he has to control the situation: either do nothing and let the bad trappers exercise mob rule (resulting in more deaths) or \\"take Johnson in\\" himself to dispense justice and clear Johnson of any charges.     Millen sets out to bring Johnson in, aided by a young \\"replacement\\" mountie just transferred in (Andrew Stevens) who proves to everyone he's not as green as they think - and Millen's long-time friend Sun Dog, (Carl Weathers) also a seasoned hunter/tough guy. Millen's efforts are complicated by the bad trappers who tag along as an unwanted \\"posse\\" which begins to grow as the film progresses.  The film moves fast enough. There are some well-placed quiet scenes between the action... but the pursuit is grueling and relentless as the protagonists trek across some of the most beautiful, yet unforgiving Canadian wilderness.    The only thing preventing this from being the perfect guy film is a pointless sub-plot involving Angie Dickinson (not that I have a problem with her!) But some of the best guy films have zero women - so they're 100% testosterone!     Despite that, this film is awesome as it proves Lee Marvin, even in the twilight of his career, was an awesome tough guy - and you can see here that it comes natural for him. Also, Bronson delivers through & through as the quiet, deadly force we've all come to know and love. Highly recommended! I'll need to buy 3 copies as soon as it's released! (2 for my bros!)
B00001PE4D|5.0|All the backstabbing is very interesting--the change in the character Sebastian from careless and mean to considerate and kind is a focal point of the plot.  Sarah Michelle Gellar is such a bad girl that she's fun!  And Reese Witherspoon's innocence is a counterpoint to Gellar's dark side--giving the movie a seamy feel that's almost dark irony.  I could watch this movie over and over just for the sheer pleasure of watching these bored, bad people do their bored, bad thing . . . until they learn the value of life the hard way!  Edgy and dark and soap opera-y, it's fun to see some of these actors when they were younger and before they became super-famous!
B0002VKZL6|5.0|Mark Knopfler just keeps making great music with a passion that I don't see as much in some veteran rockers. I was listening to KFOG San Francisco when \\"Boom, Like That\\" came on, and immediately ordered the new album (The album was out only three days) His timely tale of the birth of the McDonald's hamburger empire (and Ray Kroc's hostile takover of the McDonald brothers business in San Bernardino) was rightly written, with Mark's guitar so gentle yet rockin' that it harkened back to the early Dire Straits era of the late '70's. Stunning to say of 5:15 and Shangri-La - He made the album right here in Malibu with a close knit order of musicians that Mark wanted to have in order to get the 'sound' right. Well, he did it!! A album to have if you like Mark at his best!!  Peace - JG \\"Bear\\"

1573301183|5.0|A real testament to AIC greatness is found here in this live presentation. As heavy and at times, a little overproduced as their studio recordings were, their nuanced performance here displays warmth and sublimity with acoustic instruments. Not only that but Layne and the band really make you feel like you're just buds hanging out, hearing some great songs. LAYNE, RIP.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|Like it or hate it, the matrix trilogy is by far one of the greatest. A lot of people wanted to see the first matrix in the second and third. Duh...? The matrix was majorly philosophical and not running on walls and all that crap. The aim was to pass a message, which it did ... at least, to those who watched the movie and LISTENED and not to those who watched it, waiting for something spectacular to happen. <br />Please, just shut up and go watch something else, maybe pokemon or tom and jerry, little kids.  <br />This is a grown up movie, and though you might think, \\"Hey!I'm 20!\\" well guess what? It's for the matured, creative mind. Scr*w off.
B000007WNN|5.0|One of the best things The Cult ever did was getting Rick Rubin to produce them. Ian Astbury sounds like an ANIMAL, and the music is like RAW MEAT being ripped apart.

0316921173|5.0|So, yeah, this book isn't for everybody, but it is for some. i recommend it to those w/ a penchant for the weirdly funny and weirdly scary and sad. DFW is a spectacularly funny writer, while mixing that humor w/ intense cerebrations, high-falutent and arcane vocabularly and low grungy vernacular. \\"infinte jest\\" is a story principally about damage. every character in the novel is damaged/malformed in some way, be it orin incandenza's elephatine kicking leg or serious problems w/ females, gately's garganutan bulk and addiction, the physical beauty (which itself damages) then hideousness of madame psychosis, feral hamsters, the nation itself (suffering from serious damage to its upper northeast portion which has been ceded to canada), and so many many other characters damaged all over the place. DFW is examining damage through the scope of entertainment and addiction, either our addiction to entertainment and the damage entertainment does to us (people), or our addiction to entertainment and how addiction damages us. the characters are deftly presented and developed, especially gately and hal incandenza, the near-future US of A in which IJ takes place is well wrought and imagined, and yes, the footnotes are necessary and great. it's a monstrosity of book whose job is to be just that, and entertain. <br />READ It!
B00005LC4B|5.0|This is probably my favorite De Niro performance. In this, my man is IN SHAPE. And he's a master at f_____g with Nick Nolte and his family; a textbook performance on how to psychologically mess with another person's head. Max Cady knows how to work the ladies also - as the poor chick who gets a mouthful of her face chewed off will agree. Everyone here is at the top of their game. Scorsese talks about his love for Panavision-shot films and it is totally evident here, filmed in gorgeous anamorphic, just awesome camerawork.
B000003TAB|5.0|The first time i listened to this album when i bought it, i wasn't overly thrilled, i thought nirvana could have done better and i was surprisingly dissapointed. Then i discovered that this was a collection of rough demos, and i listened to it more, and wow! I discovered that this wasn't the nirvana i knew, after all i did buy the greatest hits first, i knew who nirvana were but i only knew like \\"smells like teen spirit\\" (who doesn't??) and \\"the man who sold the world\\" (because they played it on the radio all the time). But after i bought the greatest hits i got addicted to them and i went out and bought In Utero like 3 weeks later, and then this cd (that's right, i STILL don't have Nevermind!) i know like every song off of it by heart, but i still plan on buying it. I have the MTV unplugged cd and the famous \\"With the lights out\\" box set too. So i have become a quite large nirvana fan. So back to incesticide: <br />1. Dive- a great opening song, when i first popped in the disc for the 1st listen, this song made me smile, hearing the familiar nirvana roots. <br />2. Sliver- already heard it on greatest hits, still a good song. <br />3. Stain- a good hard song, about a strange man. <br />4. Been A Son- a nirvana classic <br />5. Turnaround- amazing lyrics, although not their original song. <br />6. Mollys Lips- my band did a cover of this song, its so fun and fast <br />7. Son of a Gun- a repeating song of pure genius <br />8. New Wave Polly- not sure if i like slow polly or fast polly, but this one is still awesome <br />9. Beeswax- a good raw song, nice chorus lyrics <br />10. Downer- a really fast sung hardcore song <br />11. Mexican Seafood- we took the name of this song as our band, disgusting lyrics but a good song <br />12. Hairspray Queen- good screeching song <br />13. Aero Zeppelin- AWESOME song, long and hardcore and good guitar riffs <br />14. Big Long Now- nice and slow and wicked <br />15. Aneurysm- always the best for last, the ultimate BEST SONG ON THE ENTIRE ALBUM, its worth the wait in the end, if not the cost of the entire album, which nowadays is 9.99. <br /> <br />WELL WORTH IT, ONE OF NIRVANA'S GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS!!!
B0000YE44Y|5.0|Having the original cd of Legend for many years, and seeing it remastered, then reissued as a 2-disc cd, it has been released again this time with a dvd inside a nice, book-sized box. If you've owned it and played it to death, this would be a fine time to lay down the cash for it again. What's especially intriguing is that many of the songs sound like extended, full-length versions of the same tracks featured on the original \\"Legend\\", leading me to believe that the original issue was mostly 7\\" edits.
B0006399FS|5.0|I completely agree with everyone who says you MUST listen to this album over and over.  It took 3-4 listens for this CD to really hit me.  I haven't stopped listening to it since I bought it and it is turning out to be one of U2's best.  \\"Miracle Drug\\" is by far one of their greatest songs.  That song alone makes this CD amazing. <br /> <br />Joshua Tree will always be U2's greatest album, but \\"How to Dismantle...\\" is a close 2nd for me.  I cannot wait to hear these songs performed live. <br /> <br />I'm 34 years old and I've been a huge U2 fan since I first listened to \\"Boy\\" on my record player, at the age of 11.  It's amazing to see a band I grew up with continue to get better and better, with no signs of stopping!

0780622553|4.0|Dark City is an extremely interesting experiment of blending futuristic settings with an oddly 1940's style of society.  Its dark atmosphere surrealistic imagery contain murky allusions of dread and foreboding, making a visually stunning treat for the eye.<br /><br />John Murdock (Rufus Sewell) awakens in a bathtub in a strange place, and staggering from his seedy hotel room sees a murdered woman lying on the floor.  But John has absolutely no memories of who he is or why he was in the room.  Even stranger is the fact that when he emerges from the hotel, the entire city has stopped moving and everyone but him is asleep.<br /><br />With John having already fled the scene, Inspector Frank Bumstead (William Hurt) arrives to investigate, noticing that though there is a dead body in the room, the killer saved a goldfish from a shattered bowl, placing it in water before he left.  Bumstead has inherited the string of murder cases from fellow cop Walenski (Colin Friels), who has gone mad and been dismissed from the police force.<br /><br />Also looking for John is Doctor Daniel Schreber (expertly played by Kiefer Sutherland), who reluctantly works for `The Strangers', peculiar pale and bald guys who run around in Pinhead/Hellraiser type costumes.  The Strangers have the ability to `Tune', shift the shape of any material matter, and Dr. Schreber has discovered that John Murdock has mysteriously developed this ability also.<br /><br />With his memories gone, Murdock tries to discover the truth behind who he is, believing that he will find the answers at a place called Shell Beach.  The only problem is, there seems to be no way to Shell Beach, and Murdock realizes that it seems to always be nighttime.  Murdock convinces his wife Anna that something is wrong, and along the way enlists the unlikely help from Inspector Bumstead, all the while running from The Strangers and trying to avoid the bizarre Dr. Schreber.  The Strangers are looking for the human soul because their breed is dying, and believe that the inhabitants of Dark City hold the key to their immortality.<br /><br />Dark City is indeed a dark movie, any dark sci-fi/fantasy fan will appreciate the atmosphere and spectacular special effects in this edgy, creepy film.  Kiefer Sutherland and William Hurt give excellent performances, Sutherland performing especially well as the lazy-eyed, limping, breathless, haggard looking Dr. Schreber.<br /><br />I liked The Strangers, even though they were a bit of a crossbreed between `Hellraiser' and `The Hidden', with slimy jellyfish things coming out of their heads at times.  I loved the special effects and the overall sinister feeling presented in the mood of the film, but the ending left me feeling a little let down and...well...cheesy.<br /><br />On a special note, simply because my mind is sick and twisted, I had a couple of laughs in this dark movie, produced strictly from associations my warped little mind made.  With The Strangers all having names like Mr. Book, Mr. Hand, Mr. Quick, Mr. Sleep, Mr. Rain...I kept waiting for Mr. Hat to pop up, from South Park.  I couldn't stop envisioning that.<br /><br />Also, when Emma Murdock sings `Sway' at the very beginning, I had to pause the DVD from laughing so hard at the memory of the hilarious scene in `Out To Sea', when Brent Spiner was singing `Sway' while Walter Mattheau and Rue McClanahan did their hilariously funny dance.  The Creep indeed. (chuckle)<br /><br />Overall, Dark City is great movie for horror or sci-fi fans that adore gothic style darkness combined with strangely modern or old-fashioned visualization, interwoven with some nice action scenes and great effects.

B0002X314C|5.0|I just purchased this CD today, and I have not put it down.  This being the digital music age, the fact that I actually went out and bought the album says a lot, but that doesn't begin to scratch the surface of the musical mastery of this CD.    John Stephens, a.k.a. John Legend, is a wonderful singer/songwriter/composer/producer.  Those who actually read liner notes of other CDs would recognize his name on other high quality hits for artists such as Lauryn Hill, Alicia Keys, and Kanye West (of course).  He spares no expense or talent on his own debut.    His voice is amazingly refreshing in the midst of carbon-copy male vocalists (think: Avant, Jaheim, etc.).  His church-influenced vocals flow effortlessly over each track.  It is difficult to highlight certain songs because the entire CD is worth a listen, but you should particularly take a listen to \\"Ordinary People\\", \\"It Don't Have to Change\\" (featuring his whole family), and \\"Stay With You\\".    If you bypass this album, you are DEFINITELY cheating yourself of a wonderful music experience.
B00006AUIG|1.0|I agree with most that the setting had potential. Talk about a slow movie with a bad story line, I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen and it never did. No chills, no thrills, followed by a lame ending. The only thing tortured here were my eyes and ears. Pathetic piece of film making!
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I can't believe that is TV Show is almost not know in Europe. What a pity. Because this is the best comedy/drama show I've ever seen!

B000002UD0|5.0|WALLS AND BRIDGES is the second album that John Lennon recorded during his separation from his second wife Yoko Ono. Hits that appeared on the posthumously released THE JOHN LENNON COLLECTION are WHATEVER GETS YOU THRU THE NIGHT with moral support from Elton John and #9 DREAM. The cover photo features a drawing by Lennon composed in June 1952. Lennon was eleven years old,nearly twelve at the time. The other songs are good.
B0002X314C|4.0|John Legend's \\"Get Lifted\\" is one of 2004's last major releases. Legend (Aka John Stephens) originally of Ohio is a gifted artist, who got his chance to shine commercially courtesy of Kayne West. Like another reviewer I first learned of John Legend when I heard his impressive chorus on Talib Kweli's \\"Around My Way\\". After the prelude Legend takes his audience to another place with the smooth \\"Let's Get Lifted\\". The album's impressive lead single \\"Used to Love You\\" follows.  Kayne West makes an appearance on the upbeat \\"Number One\\", while Snoop Dogg drops in for memorable \\"I Can Change\\". My favourite track is \\"Stay With You\\", Legend sings a beautiful story of everlasting love with the end result being an excellent track. Two more of my favourites include the outstanding \\"So High\\" and \\"Refuge\\" (When It's Cold Outside). \\"Live It Up\\" with violist Miri Ben Ari closes the album off well. John Legend's \\"Get Lifted\\" is the kind of release, which appeals to a wide variety of different types of music listeners, I recommend checking this one out.
B000002UC5|5.0|The Beatles had not yet broken up,and Paul McCartney had not yet formed his sophomore band Wings. In between,McCartney put out his solo debut album in the spring of 1970,right around the release of the Beatles' LET IT BE. Original pressings of the LP featured a granny smith apple seen whole on side 1 and halved on side 2. The album begins with THE LOVELY LINDA,an ode to McCartney's now-deceased first wife,the former Linda Eastman. I dedicate that track to the memory of Linda(she passed away in April 1998). The track subsequently appeared on the 2001 compilation,WINGSPAN. Also that appeared on WINGSPAN is MAN WE WAS LONELY and JUNK. An alternate version of JUNK appeared on the Beatles' ANTHOLOGY 3,released in 1996. The same applies to TEDDY BOY. All the other songs are good. The same year this album was released,McCartney's fellow Beatles,the late John Lennon released his PLASTIC ONO BAND album and the late George Harrison released his ALL THINGS MUST PASS album. One of the top 100 albums of the 1970's.

If we take as a given that this is an accurate portrayal of the way an autistic person's mind works, it explains and lends empathy to those with autism.  We can see how Christopher's actions, to him, seem entirely logical and normal, whereas to those he interacts with they seem bizarre and abnormal (excepting his father and teachers).   <br /> <br />The story unfolds as Christopher discovers the neighbor's dog, Wellington, murdered.  A garden rake has impaled the poor creature and Christopher decides he will investigate the murder.  His investigation is used as a tool to show his interactions with neighbors, strangers, his father, and his teacher, from his point of view as he keeps a journal of his activities.  The cleverness of the novel is that it also allows us to see how others react to him, which is illuminating.  We see Christopher from both points of view. <br /> <br />The story is also a tragedy in that as Christopher unravels his mystery - he discovers things about his family that bring the world crashing down on him.  To avoid spoiling the story I will not go into details on this, other than say the novel also shows how difficult dealing with Christopher has been on those closest to him. <br /> <br />The one frightening thing about the novel is that Christopher is amoral - not in the sense of being evil - but he thinks in a very logical fashion and has no sense of right and wrong or the consequences of his actions.  It's just the way he's wired, so to speak. <br /> <br />The novel, written in the form of journal, is also full of other tidbits about the way Christopher thinks.  For example he's a genius in math and there are a number of mathematical puzzles sprinkled throughout. <br /> <br />Overall, this was very quick read and a very interesting piece of writing. <br />
B000002UAX|5.0|I was just introduced to the beatles like 3-4 weeks ago and i have bout the \\"The Yellow Submarine Sountrack\\", \\"The Magical Mystery Tour\\", and now \\"The White Album\\". If you are going to listen to The Beatles you have to really sit down, chilled, or with your favorite type of herb ;) my favorite time to listen) to apprehiate ther work so dont exspect to download one song and come up with weather or not u like them. When ur felling \\"low\\" they are a uplifting band that will turn a bad day into a good day with a funky beat (thats the first time ive used that word ^.^) and great lyrics that usally have a point or moral. But if your listening to them when your felling \\"high\\" they are a god- sent. With ther crazy lyrics with the combo of that great beat and intristing instruments used will make u Grin like \\"The Grinch\\" when he had the idea to destroy xmas. Were as to Pink floyds \\"TDSOTM\\" scares the crap outa you with ther guys running and clocks going off outa no were. But if your into 60's-70's physcadelic music i would recommened Grand Funk Rail Road and of course Pink Floyd to go with your collection. But once you listen to a whole album by the beatles u will understand what that beatlemania was all about. - Salz (m/15/Ny) P.S. my review was mostly about the beatles rather then the album because all ther originle albums are about the same.(The only song that i had listend to this album before i bout it was Ob La Di,Ob La Da because i new it was the beatles so i would like it.)
B00005JMAH|5.0|This is the most refined and most developed movie yet in the \\"Harry Potter\\" series.  It has a stylish, more mature feel to it, thanks to the directing of Alfonso Cuaron. <br /> <br />Cuaron makes use of an iris effect throughout the film, with wonderful results.  Scenes open and close in a dreamy, otherworldly sense that only compliments both the setting and the storyline. <br /> <br />While much of Rowling's world has changed since the first two films (directed by Christopher Columbus), it has, for the most part, been improved upon.  The castle and its grounds feel older and darker, mirroring the characters' growth into moody adolescence. <br /> <br />Younger viewers (and a handful of older viewers, for that matter) may be frightened by the on-screen depiction of Rowlings' dementors, which are every bit as fear-enducing as the text would lead one to believe. <br /> <br />Daniel Radcliffe and Co. have done a fine job as well in this latest installment.  Their acting skills are much-improved, and the actors seem to have much better chemistry between one another. <br /> <br />This is an enjoyable film for Harry Potter fans and cinephiles alike.  Cuaron has adapted a great book into a very well-made movie.
B00001OH7Y|5.0|Bowie has a huge catalogue of great albums (Hunky Dory, Aladdin Sane, Diamond Dogs, Station to Station, Lodger, Outside 1. to name just few) but Scary Monsters is definately a personal favourite.<BR>From the opening track 'It's No Game' you know this is going to be an intense, unique listening experience.  With David screaming as if in emotional pain and the lyrics being interpreted in Japanese, it's a brilliant opening track.  The brilliance does not end there.  Not a weak track to be found, 'Ashes to Ashes' is one of the most stunning singles on the radio that or any year (not sure how it ever became a hit seeing as it is not exactly a commercial sounding song), the paranoid Teenage Wildlife is a favourite for me, but the intense title track and the remake of Kingdom Come are all sung through Bowie coloured glasses (definately not the colour of roses).  By the time that 'It's No Game' is reprised at the end of the album, it is sung in a quieter, more reserved manner as if intensity of the previous songs have made him more resigned to the attrocities of the world as he sees it.<BR>I do not believe (as many reviewers do) that this is Bowie's last great album.  His post Monsters albums ,since the '80's ended, have all been terrific, creative and relevant.  However, this album is one of his very best.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|I think this is the best romantic comedy ever!  I love it and just bought it on dvd.
0425173755|3.0|I read about 60 Agatha Christie mysteries in my teens. It took me about a year to realize that she's a mediocre writer. It seems like she owes her fame to the lower demands placed on escapism in a different era. I can't imagine that if she started her career today the results would be the same. She's not real challenging. I don't remember much about them, except that she averaged one good book for every 15 I read. The 4 that still distinguish themselves in my memory are Crooked House, Towards Zero, Roger Aykroyd and this.     This generally reads like an outline. I mentally checked out after about three pages. That's how I recall her, years later; an author that \\"checks out\\" once she gave the formula a crank. The middle of this book has been described as \\"inert.\\" Each page offers slim reasons to continue on. A crime occurs followed by a long sequence of interviews. That's just not very engaging and probably causes the books main problem; It doesn't build. Only in the last three chapters does Poirot get things moving again. Her writing doesn't draw you in. It doesn't offer much to envision. Her characterization is not strong. She avoids writing in which characters aren't speaking.     (Spoiler)   You actually do have a better chance of guessing the solution here than in the 1974 movie (which is enjoyable for other reasons). Remember until the last few pages of the book the red herrings are all a reader has, and it's a long trip though those phoned-in middle chapters. The apparent mystery is just not interesting and it's solved with about ten seconds of thought, so why waste 23 chapters on it? It would have been a better book if she had constructed those middle chapters with more complexity.    People probably don't admire this book for the writing. Ignoring the fact that these characters probably would not have been able to assemble anonymously, the book is a clever solution that deserves a better lead-up    Side note: It seems like you'd have to have some very poortaste, to include the Lindbergh kidnapping (`32) as a major plot point just two years after it occurred. Christie also took actress Gene Teirney's exposure to german measles (and subsequent retarded & blind child) at an Army canteen and used it in The Mirror Crack'd.
B00005JNEI|5.0|. . . then you hate America. Please remember what this movie is about: it is a tribute to the soldiers. This is particularly clear in the second half, which tells the story of a mother who lost her son in Iraq. It is a tribute to the mothers and fathers who have lost children in Bush's war. To say you \\"hate this movie\\" or that \\"Moore is a propagandist\\" is to deny and disgrace the real struggles and sufferings of those who have lost loved ones in Iraq.  <br /> <br />I'd like to see any of the cowards who denounced this movie take issue with the mother in the second half of it.

B00005QZ7U|4.0|Baz Luhrmann has reached back into history and brought forward both a story and a style, and in doing so has proved that he is able to make some of the best films in the world. This is the kind of film that will really polarise viewers. You are either going to hate this film or fall in love with it. I don't think there will be any middle ground. <br /> <br />Moulin Rouge is the third in what Luhrmann calls his 'Red Curtain' series, the first two being Strictly Ballroom and Romeo and Juliet. He also refers to this as 'audience participation cinema' where the audience makes a conscious decision to become part of the film. With Moulin Rouge, he has succeed in producing a film that is both a great joy and a sorrow to be a part of. While similar in underlying style to the first two films, Moulin Rouge goes beyond both these films into a whole new world. This is a musical, a musical of the type that we have not seen since the heyday of such great films as The Sound Of Music. While it is a musical, Luhrmann has brought this style forward into the 21st century. The music that has been used is contemporary popular music. We hear songs such as Like A Virgin, Your Song and Roxanne. The use of these and many others is brilliant. Not only does it make this a contemporary musical, but each of these songs has a context that we are used to hearing them in. They each mean something to us and have an association in our mind. Luhrmann has used this existing meaning with great skill, both to make it clear what a character feels when they sing that song, as well as using them jarringly out of context to great comedic effect. The majority of the songs have been set to an orchestral backing. Maybe I am showing my age, but I think they sound better with the rich backing of a full orchestra.  <br /> <br />While this is a musical, it is also both a comedy and a tragedy. Luhrmann calls them high comedy and high tragedy. We cover an incredible range of styles, both in film and music. In a fewshort scenes we can move from a drama to a music hall-type number. Then we more into high comedy and a Gilbert and Sullivan style. From there we return to a 40s style set piece and then on to high tragedy and scenes that tug at the heartstrings.  <br /> <br />    To those that think two people breaking into song in the middle of a film is silly, then you are really going to miss out on something rather special. I think people have missed the direct use of song in film. Music speaks to a different part of us and love expressed in music seems far deeper than mere words can express. Imagine the scene at the end of An Officer And A Gentleman without the music. I don't see songs as out of place in this kind of film but almost a necessity as the feeling between the characters becomes greater than can be expressed without song and music - it transcends the limitations of language.  <br /> <br />All the actors in this film bring home brilliant performances. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are perfect as our two ill-fated lovers. Nicole can sing. In fact, she sings extremely well. She is also a consummate actor who brings the part of Satine to life with great skill. You cannot help but to be drawn to her character, and if I may be so bold, there is no doubt that Nicole is a very beautiful woman and the costumes in this film are incredible. Ewan also cuts a very dashing figure in his part. The sets and costumes are a visual spectacular; rich colours, incredible backdrops. All come together to make this an incredibly rich visual feast. Everywhere that you look there is something happening, something colourful, some movement and dance. You will not catch everything the first time you see this film, and most viewers will want to enjoy this film multiple times.  <br /> <br />The pace of the film is sometimes neck-breaking. Early in the film where we first 'go down the rabbit hole' the pace is manic. Some may find it extreme, with a wild ride of images bombarding the viewer and the number of edits per second incredible. This is all entirely intentional and sets the tone and feel of the Moulin Rouge, and the world that the director is creating for his story. At no time during the film will you have time to be bored. The energy levels in the film are breathtaking. The speed and energy in the dance routines are just amazing.  <br /> <br />The story is a simple one, timeless and beautiful as well as sad. A young courtesan is caught between her love for a young penniless writer, and a rich but evil duke. The owner of the Moulin Rouge needs money and he is using Satine to draw in the duke to finance his new venture. He hopes to convert the Moulin Rouge into a theatre and is betting on a new play he is having written. The play is being written by the Bohemians. The Bohemians are having a little trouble with the play and fate brings them together with an aspiring young writer, Christian, who has just moved to Paris. Christian falls in love with Satine. This leads to problems as Satine and the Moulin Rouge need the duke for his money, and he is not going to invest in the new theatre unless Satine is his. Christian also needs the duke as he is financing the play he is writing with the Bohemians. The play that is being written within the film becomes a reflection of the world of the film and leads to the final confrontation. Fate intervenes to make this a tragedy. While this is a tragedy, we are left with the conviction that there is love in the world. <br />
0790731509|1.0|Holleywood released this turkey under a different name and received a critical review and poor audience so they renamed it and tried again. I saw this at the Drive In theatre and my now wife and I still laugh about sleeping through this. I'd rate this Class C movie at 0 popcorn bags. Save your money and time folks and watch a sitcom on tv for more thrills.
B0001ADAVK|3.0|\\"I thought I was headed to a place that would turn out tomorrow's leaders, not their wives.\\" <br /> <br />It would be easy to say \\"here we go again\\" with this film, because Mona Lisa Smile follows much of a plot we have all seen many times before. It is yet another take on the \\"good-hearted yet radical and initially misunderstood teacher making a difference to the lives of troubled students while battling the stiff-upper lips of the conservative school establishment\\" story. Heard it all before haven't you? It's The Emperor's Club at a pinch and Dead Poets Society without a doubt, but with one major difference. This time it's girls in the main roles of teacher and students. A sort of \\"Dead Poets for chicks\\" if you like. It's even set in the 1950s New England area of America in an ultra-conservative and extremely well-to-do college, so the parallels with the Peter Weir classic of 1989 are uncanny. A pretty decent ensemble cast has been gathered for this film with the likes of Julia Roberts, Kirsten Dunst, Julia Stiles, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Marcia Gay Harden all playing major roles, while directing duties are handled by Mike Newell, the bloke responsible for Four Weddings and a Funeral and Donnie Brasco among others.  <br /> <br />    Julia Roberts stars as Katherine Watson. She has just arrived at the elitist Wellesley College in Massachusetts to teach art history to the bevy of wealthy young ladies who attend the college. Katherine is in her early 30s, is single, and hails from California. She carries with her a slightly new-age way of looking at things. This is probably the most implausible aspect of the film since her character seems more like a late 60s model of woman rather than the 1953 version. Anyway, she lands at the famous college for young ladies to teach the history of art, and from day one realises she is in for more than she initially expected. <br /> <br />The girls enrolled in her first class are all completely versed in practically everything she tries to teach them in the first lesson. It seems they have learnt their textbooks by rote and are simply looking for an easy pass in this most boring of subjects. It doesn't take long before Katherine realises with some angst that most of the girls attending the college are merely biding their time before they get married to some eligible young beau, most probably from neighbouring Harvard University. Wellesley is merely a finishing school disguised as a college, she laments. This theory is reinforced when she learns there are even lessons for the girls on such subjects as grooming and deportment, manners, and incredibly, how to stage a dinner party properly. But Katherine wants to fight these archaic traditions and so tries to open the girls' minds to some alternative ways of looking at things (such as modern art), and also raises the possibility of them pursuing other things after they leave the college - such as going to law school. It is this latter point that she presses home with the incredibly bright Joan (Julia Stiles), who is intelligent enough to pursue a law career, but has not looked past the fact that she will hopefully be married and caring for her new husband when she leaves college. At the same time Katherine manages to exact the venom of another student and editor of the school newspaper, Betty Warren (Kirsten Dunst). Betty is about to be married and cannot possibly imagine why Miss Watson would be campaigning for her students to be thinking of anything other than a home, a husband and a family. Her vitriolic attacks in the paper attract the attention of the faculty, and worse, the alumni, which includes Betty's mother and seems all-powerful at making staffing decisions for the school. Katherine is also feeling the wrath of the faculty when she starts to become romantically involved with the Italian professor, Bill Dunbar (Dominic West) which is just one of a fair handful of romantic liaisons that form the basis of this story. Can Katherine make thegirls see the error of their way and convince them to see past a life tied to the kitchen and vacuum cleaner? And can she do this before she gets the boot from the conservative and staid school establishment? Well you'll just have to watch to find out. <br /> <br />There isn't much original about this story at all - we've seen it all before and truth be told in a much better way. I remember walking out of the cinema after seeing this and wondering just how do scriptwriters get away with lifting so much material and inspiration from another film. It is really quite obvious that Dead Poets Society has formed the core of this script idea, but for some reason all the really good bits of that film, the pure agony of being a teenager and living with parental expectations - the emotional centre if you like - has been removed. What we are left with is a rather pedestrian, by-the-numbers film that will entertain, but will hardly make anyone think too hard. <br />

B00005O3VC|5.0|King Arthur and his knights embark on a low-budget search for the Grail, encountering many very silly obstacles. <br /> <br />That is the tagline from the Internet Movie Database, and at the end of the day (and this reviewing session) I could not come up with a better way of describing the film. What do you get when you give about 230,000 to a couple of debutante directors and the rest of the members of the greatest comic collective the world has ever seen? Monty Python And The Holy Grail! <br /> <br />Monty Python And The Holy Grail is a truly great film and in particular a truly great comedy - to still generate laughs even after repeated viewings. <br /> <br />What is the film about? King Arthur (Graham Chapman) is seeking knights to join him in the court of Camelot, and after some run-ins with the French, eventually gathers together Sir Bedevere (Terry Jones), Sir Lancelot (John Cleese), Sir Galahad the Chaste (Michael Palin) and Sir Robin the Not So Brave (Eric Idle). After not returning to Camelot for reasons well detailed in the film, the knights are confronted by God who gives them an awesome task - to find the Holy Grail. Now the fun really begins! They have to confront the dangers of The White Rabbit and The Bridge Of Death in order to seek what they hope to find. Many months pass before the possibility of success finally arrives. But then again, perhaps not. In case you are wondering, Terry Gilliam plays the part of Patsy - Arthur's \\"horse\\" - but like everyone else also plays a bunch of other parts, so typically Monty Python. Not so typically Monty Python is the fact that apart from Dennis's mother, all female parts are actually played by females! <br /> <br />With classic comedy scenes aplenty - you must have seen the Black Knight scene surely? - that still are as funny today as they were twenty five odd years ago, this is truly a gem of a film. What this bunch of comic geniuses managed to achieve on a shoestring budget remains one of the pre-eminent comedy classics, ranking up there with the likes of Buster Keaton's The General. Okay, it looks cheap and nasty at times, but you really would be hard-pressed to make any complaint - there are plenty of way over-budget Hollywood pieces of tripe that could not even approach the delights of this film with one hundred times the budget. And this was but one of their classic films! When you add into the mix a collection of some of the funniest gag subtitles during the opening credits, the inspired surprise opening and everything else, this is a true classic DVD release. <br /> <br />Monty Python fans have been awaiting this sort of local release for far too long and to finally have it is to emphasise why. Whilst the film urges you to run away frequently, the only direction you should be running is towards your nearest DVD retailer to order this DVD. Brilliant stuff all through, and an essential purchase for any DVD collection.  <br /> <br />
B00004UFYU|5.0|<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />This cd is absolutely GREAT for your body and mind. <br />The composer lives in Belgium and I once had the chance to talk to him. <br />He told me the history behind the composition and that's amazing. <br />He told me that it was written after several operations he had to undergo, and the music we hear is a registration of the feelings he had in hospital. <br />He started with some rough lines he had written in 1998 and 2000, and then he created this masterpiece !
B00005J6UP|5.0|The Goonies.. What can I say? The Goonies was one of my all time favourite movies as a kid. It had everything - adventure, danger, treasure, cool gizmos, and bumbling bad guys. This, in my books, is the best kids adventure movie ever made. What's more, it is still great to watch as an adult - there are numerous gags that would just go straight over the heads of kids that now make so much more sense.  <br />The Goondocks, in Astoria, are being demolished to make way for a golf course and resort. A local bunch of kids, who have affectionately named themselves The Goonies, are not taking the news too kindly as this is their favourite place in the whole wide world. On a rainy day before the Goondocks were due to be demolished Mikey Walsh (Sean Astin), Brandon Walsh (Josh Brolin), Mouth (Corey Feldman), Chunk (Jeff Cohen), and Data (Johnathon Ke Quan) are bumming around the Walsh house feeling very depressed. On a whim they decide to go rummaging through the attic, out-of-bounds to all mind you, and 'stumble' across an ancient treasure map and doubloon depicting the whereabouts of One-Eyed Willie and his treasure.  <br />Needless to say The Goonies see this as a great adventure, not to mention a chance to pay off foreclosing banks! Along the way they get mixed up with the Fratellis, some of the most bumbling 'evil' criminals ever to grace the silver screen. Ma Fratelli (Anne Ramsey) is the matriach with a firm controlling hand on Jake (Robert Davi), and Francis (Joe Pantoliano). Boy, is Ma one scary lady! The Goonies also come across Andy (Kerri Green) and Stef (Martha Plimpton). These two join the swelling ranks of The Goonies and help wend their way through the caves and booby traps laid by One-Eyed Willie centuries ago.  <br />Throw into this movie mix the enigmatic, and gigantically huge, Sloth (John Matuszak), booby traps, high adventure, a blender, a few bats, an octopus (almost!), incredible treasure, a one-eyed pirate, falling boulders, the most amazing waterslide, a few skeletons, and a buccaneer fight aboard an ancient pirate sloop - what more do you want? This is a great movie that I am very pleased to have in my collection.

B0002KVUKM|3.0|From writer/director Stephen Sommers, the man who bought us The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, two of the greatest action/adventure movies of the last decade, comes Van Helsing - a tale of a monster slayer who is sent on a quest to Transylvania to rid the world forever of Count Vladislaus Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) and to save the life of Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), the last member of Transylvania's royal family. To make things more difficult, Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) discovers upon his arrival in Transylvania that he is up against more than just the humble vampire. Accompanying Van Helsing on his mission is Carl (David Wenham), a 19th century version of James Bond's Q who, among other things, exhales some truly great one-liners throughout the course of the film, a highlight of which is \\"Why does it smell like wet dog in here?\\". I remember this moment induced a huge roar of laughter at the cinema but without seeing the scene that preceded it it's a little hard to appreciate here.  <br /> <br />Hugh Jackman puts in a very admirable performance indicating once again why he is one of Australia's greatest exports. David Wenham's performance in what is essentially the role of comedic side-kick is extremely funny and entertaining. It is certainly a diversion from his previous roles and a very interesting addition to his repertoire. While playing the role of Count Dracula, Richard Roxburgh with his accent and wig is barely recognisable. He brings to this much-played character a very entertaining fresh twist - indeed it is the uniqueness of Roxburgh's performance that is particularly notable. Having been played so many times before it is becoming inherently difficult to bring something new to the character which Roxburgh has succeeded in doing. Kate Beckinsale very near revives her role from her previous film Underworld, once again trying to vanquish, among other things, werewolves.  <br /> <br />As you might well have guessed this is a film that relies heavily on theuse of special effects and while at times they are spectacular (the horses jumping the ravine is certainly a highlight), this once again proves that effects don't make a film - writing does. While Sommer's intentions were good, if not a little ambitious, the film is a tad clunky at times and doesn't quite deliver in the writing department. That's not to say it a terrible film - nothing could be further from the truth, as it is certainly a worthy addition to the action/adventure genre. However, given my fondness for the two Mummy films it is inevitable that comparisons be made and without being too over-critical Van Helsing simply doesn't compete with either of them. Despite its short-falls Van Helsing is still a fun couple of hours and is well worth a watch.
B00068IOWC|1.0|I'm giving this whole \\"Limited Edition\\" package a one star rating, not the album alone. I'd like to consider myself a die-hard U2 fan but I honestly felt ripped off when I gave over this much money for nothing. The book included is ... Amazon wouldn't approve of the word I want to use so I'll just say useless. You can live without the DVD, it's nothing special. If you want How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, buy the single (cheaper) CD.
B00005JMAH|3.0|The movie was much better in many areas but it was so inconsistent with both the book and the previous two movies that the amazing special effects were useless. <br /> <br />Hogwarts is completely changed for no reason other than for the director to have his \\"own\\" movie.  What's up with the clock tower?  What's up with the shrunken head? <br /> <br />The most dissapointing part of the movie was the Quidditch.  The one Quidditch game that they showed was completely unrealistic.  The players chase the Snitch into the clouds and outside the stadium... just stupid.  The Firebolt was at the end of the movie and had no point. <br /> <br />That's my main problem with this movie... it had no point.  The books are excellent and have meaning behind them, but the movies are choppy. <br /> <br />Time management is poor.  The film is the right length, but time is wasted in scenes like when Harry flies the hippogriff. <br /> <br />Besides the Quidditch, the next worst part was the lack of explanation for Moony (sorry I meant Mooney) Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs.  There is no reference at all to how they were friends at school or even who they are. <br /> <br />If you have never read the books (even if you have seen the first two movies) this movie will be hard to follow and likely will be too confusing to enjoy.  If you have read the books, like I have, the special effects are good enough that is still an enjoyable movie.  Still, it could have been done so much better.

B0002X314C|5.0|John Legend's voice and style is clean and crisp. I first learned about him from hearing him sing ORDINARY PEOPLE with only a piano for a radio station in CHICAGO. I downloaded it from the station's website and have been in love with him ever since. He was also on Smokey Robinson's BET tribute. I don't know what song he sang but I couldn't take my eyes off the screen during his song! His voice is so amazing it stops you in your tracks. He could sing anything and make it sound good. There are many tracks on this CD that are great to drive/clean/chill/work or whatever you do to music. I hope that John gets the recognition he deserves. He is a true and mature R&B SOUL artist without all the booty shaking, sexual innuendo's, and bling bling that saturate the market today. Just pure voice and style. Reminds me of a male Alicia Keys. Thank you JOHN LEGEND AND KANYE WEST!

B0002F6BRE|2.0|First, I'll cover the bad points. Ferrel's performance is good, but he has too many scenes where he stuffs a whole plate of spaghetti into his mouth at once. Elves don't have manners? Furthermore, Ferrel's character has almost super powers, which is not really explained by the movie. Another point, Caan is miscast as the father. I like James Caan as an actor, but he doesn't really fit. Also, Caan's character's change of heart is not prefaced very well. Having Ed Asner as a grumpy Santa does not fit well either. He drags down the story occasionally when he is on.    The good parts of the movie are the following. First, Ferrel's love relationship with the girl from the store and their shower duet is very cool. Second, The relationship between the brothers develops nicely. Third, Steenburgen's character as the stepmother is good, but she is too understanding. Fourth, Bob Newhart is hilarious as \\"Papa Elf.\\" And finally, the smaltzy, obligatory, \\"Saving Christmas\\" scene at the end does work at some weird level.    My brother and friends highly praised the movie to me, so I probably had my expectations too high. I asked my wife what she thought about the movie and she said, \\"It worked in spots.\\" I think that is a very good review.
B0006A9FMI|3.0|The first Ghost in the Shell DVD from Manga Video was an excellent release. But, it lacked one key component: A Japanese language, 5.1 Dolby Digital surround sound track. Those of us with surround sound setups who appreciate listening to a movie in its original form were sorely disappointed with the weak stereo track provided.  <br /> <br />And now, the GITS 2 Innocence DVD has been released by Dreamworks. And again, key components are missing. Every film released on DVD(that features only the original language soundtrack) in a foreign country MUST have standard, non-hearing impared, subtitling as a minimum. The amount of space consumed on a DVD by subtitling information is miniscule. They could have easily fit both standard and caption subtitles for twenty different languages if they had wished to do so. The english hearing-impared captions for this DVD are massive. On a 16x9 television the gigantic captions take up the full bottom half of the screen. A movie that supports so much visual beauty does not deserve this type of treatment. I expected Dreamworks to take better care of such a great film. They allowed a simple omission to mar a fantastic experience. I truly regret not catching this in theaters when I had the chance.
B00006950W|5.0|It's a zombie movie based on a popular video game, so I didn't expect much.  I was pleasantly surprised.  A bit of mystery, characters with personality and -- of course -- the zombies all came together to make a good film.  Science fiction and horror fans are right to love it.
B000002BPS|4.0|I loved The Offspring's \\"Americana\\", but \\"Smash\\" did not deserve the hype it got. \\"Ixnay on the Hombre\\" barely got any, but yet its better than \\"Smash\\"! There are some great, true Offspring songs here; even two songs that appeared in the videogame \\"Crazy Taxi\\". If you are a true Offspring fan, then this album will not dissapoint. Though none of the tracks are like \\"Come out and Play\\" (their breakthrough hit), most of them deserve to be singles. Now it's time for the song-by-song review that everyone has been waiting for...not. <br />1. Disclaimer: The Offspring's best intro. Of course, it gets no grade, because intros don't deserve any. <br />2. The Meaning of Life (2:56) A- <br />Nice song! Fast, catchy, good music. Great way to start off the album. <br />3. Mota (2:57) A- <br />Once the actual song starts (past the long drumming), the song gets really catchy. The chorus is awesome. Of course, this song is about drugs! What else could one sing about? I could name a lot of things, but \\"Mota\\" is Spanish for weed, so this is definitely not a cheesy love song (skip to Track 7). Great song. <br />4. Me & My Old Lady (4:33) A- <br />I don't know what Dexter Holland (the lead singer) says at the beginning of the song. Good song otherwise, catchy, and has some catchy foreign music. Slower than most Offspring songs, but well executed. <br />5. Cool To Hate (2:47) B+ <br />Powerfully sang, but not an easy song to hate. Funny, it's about stuff that The Offspring hates. Good song. <br />6. Leave it Behind (1:57) A- <br />Catchy and sticks in your mind. Some of the lyrics aren't too well written so the song sometimes doesn't make sense. Great song, because of its music. <br />7. Gone Away (4:28) A <br />Slow and drifts away from the usual Alternative/Punk that The Offspring writes. A well written, sad song about grieving over a lost girlfriend. One of the best songs on the album. <br />8. I Choose (3:54) B+ <br />I don't like this song much, but the guitar riffs are great. Decent, but there are much better songs out there. The chorus is better than the verses. <br />9. Intermission: John Mayer (yes, of \\"Daughters\\" fame) speaks in this 'intermission' while \\"Tea For Two\\" is being played. Sounds kind of weird at points in this interlude. <br />10. All I Want (1:54) A- <br />I've heard it so many times in \\"Crazy Taxi\\", I'm kind of sick of it. Otherwise, a great rock song. Sure to please fans and haters worldwide. <br />11. Way Down The Line (2:36) A- <br />Great song I'm also bored from by playing \\"Crazy Taxi\\" too many times. The verses are kind of annoying, but this song has a pretty true meaning. Great execution; the chorus is great. Everyone will like this song; well at least the people not afraid to grow up like their parents. <br />12. Don't Pick It Up (1:53) A+ <br />The best song on the album. Funny and executed in the ska-style used to make \\"What Happened To You?\\" such a great song. If this song wasn't so unbelievably catchy, I would not like it as much. <br />13. Amazed (4:25) A <br />Awesome song with a deep meaning. 'Nuff said. <br />14. Change The World (6:23) A <br />I LOVE THE BEGINNING OF THIS SONG! It is taken from the end of \\"Smash\\" (the last song on the album called \\"Smash\\" and at the end of it -- confused yet?). O.K., go back to \\"Smash\\" and listen to the end of the last song on the album. It's the same! Also, the hidden track at the end of \\"Smash\\" there is a strange instrumental used to flavour up the last song of \\"Americana\\", \\"Pay the Man\\". OK, enough about this. The actual song is pretty awesome in itself. Listen to the sixth minute of the song and you'll hear a lady say \\"I think you guys should try Heavy Metal; kiss my @$$! Ha, ha, ha.\\" <br /> <br />Overall, this album gets an A-/B+. It's a great album, but \\"Americana\\" is so much better. Get out and buy this, then buy \\"Americana\\" and see what you think. Come on, it's The Offspring!
B00009APK1|5.0|It is not easy to take fantasy from the printed page and portray it in a serious manner on the silverscreen.  This movie accomplished that, though.  Characters with depth, excellent scenery and a storyline that moves makes this a great film.
0767834739|1.0|What I mean by \\"fart in the wind\\" is that once it's out in the open, it goes away fast, but while it's in the vicinity it's seriously rank. I couldn't get over the fact that the first one was fairly good, and this one just let me down. The story can't decide whether it's going to follow the games' story lines or if it's going to go on it's own. It takes some characters from the games like Jill, Carlos, Sherry, and Nicolei, and makes every single one pointless. Even Alice, who was likable to a certain degree in the first one (at least you want her character to live) but in this one she is just a [jerk]. You really didn't care what characters lived or died in this tradgedy that calls itself a film. Even Jovovich who is a decent actress did a poor job, and don't even get me started on the other actors. Especially the chick who played Jill. Just watch the way she holds her guns. She obviously had no training whatsoever. And Nemesis just look like a pile of poo rapped in armor. He looked so fake! And if you haven't played the games or read the books, you will have no idea whats going on. It never even explained what the S.T.A.R.S were, and therefor leaves all the non-gamers totally clueless.<br /><br />If you actually liked this movie I recomend: House of the Dead, its a HORRIBLE zombie flick. The worst I have ever seen, actually worse than this one. And if you liked both movies, you have bad taste.<br /><br />What I learned from Resident Evil: Apocalypse: Nothing, this is a no-brainer.
0671027344|4.0|Chbosky's novel is a true-to-life account of life as an \\"outsider.\\"  The haunting reality with which he depicts the day-to-day life of Charlie clearly shows Chbosky's ability to empathize with the stereotypical wallflower.  Not without its own little twist \\"Wallflower\\" does not dissapoint in the least.  A novel, easily read in one sitting, that can also make you want to drop the book and look the other way is an accomplishment to be proud of.
B00005V6OD|2.0|I have enjoyed it but only so far. Imagination reigns and you expect unrealistic scenes, but there is a limit. At some stage Harry is given an 'invisibility cloak' left to him by his deceased parents. Soon after he has to hide from the badies. The invisibility cloak would have come in handy there but he appears to forget all about it. My five-year old son commented: why is he not hiding under the magic coat? When flaws are spotted by five-year olds, then there must be something wrong. In this Harry Potter madness are we losing our sense of criticism?
B00005JNEI|4.0|Before watching this movie I had never seen a Michael Moore film.  Although I had heard much talk about Moore's films being works of fiction or at the very least subjective, I couldn't believe that such films would be labeled documentaries if such were true.  Well I was wrong.  In an extremely egotistical rant Michael Moore presents his version of what happened in Iraq and Afghanistan while taking quotes and interviews out of context.  This film is not objective and as a fan of film I am disgusted at the cloaking of the reality of this movie.  Instead of observing the reality of the situation and presenting the facts to the public, Moore begins with a thesis and strives to prove it. <br />All that being said this movie is very well made.  As a piece of propaganda it is extremely effective.  Anyone who is not thoroughly educated on the subject matter will fall into Moore's trap and automatically see the Bush Administration as treasonous actors in politics. <br />Moore is a very shrewd individual and I give him credit for producing a fine work of propaganda, but not a documentary.

B0000028RR|5.0|Ratm's self titled debut album is by far my favorite of all their cd's. its ten songs long and you dont need to touch the fast forward button once. no filler whatsoever. it hasnt left my cd player for weeks, and the fast forward button is really starting to collect dust. the best songs(in my opinion) are: <br />Bombtrack <br />Bullet in the Head <br />Killing in the name <br />and <br />Fistful of Steel <br /> <br /> <br />Cause, <br />if the vibe was suicide, <br />then you would push da button, <br />But if ya bowin down, <br />then let me do the cuttin.
B00005JKG5|5.0|\\"Flashdance\\" is the movie that got me hooked on dancing, and I used to love it to death. After reading bad reviews that said it is just a music video with extra scenes, I've realized that it is true, but that doesn't stop me from loving this movie. It is about an 18 year old girl named Alex who dreams of going to the Pittsburgh dance company, but she can't afford it. She lives in a broken down warehouse, and works as a welder by day and Flashdancer by night. She doesn't strip naked, but strips down to skimpy leotards. The most tittilating scene is probably when she is doused with the bucket of water. The cinematography on that shot is just brilliant! Anyway, she falls in love with her boss, who looks like he's WAY too old for her. Her friend Jeanie wants to be a professional ice skater, and Jeanie's boyfriend Richie wants to be a stand up comedian. They both make an attempt to pursue their goals, but Alex is to afraid to apply to the company; everyone there is rich and glamorous, with high heels and fancy clothes. Alex walks in with big poofy hair, thick boots, and army jacket, and beat up jeans. She has an elderly lady named Hanna who guides her along the way. No one is really sure of Hanna's relationship with Alex; is she her grandmother, or simply an old ballerina? Another setback for Alex is the bar across the street from the one she works at. The owner is a total sleazebag, and treats Alex like an object. Alex finally musters up the courage to audition, in the most energetic and triumphant dance scene ever filmed. The song she dances to is the Academy Award winning \\"Flashdance...What A Feeling\\", one my favorite songs ever. If you are a dancer or just like watching people dance, then go out and rent this movie.
B0006399FS|2.0|This album is so disappointing.Four years and all this hype and this is what comes out.I am a big u2 fan and love a lot of their songs.There are no great songs on this album.Most of the songs are mediocre.One or two are good.There are no real rockers.Vertigo is a total disappointment.Edges guitar work gets repititive.I was hoping for one song to equal some of their best like-bad,elevation,beautiful day,one,without you and so many others.I loved their last album as much as any of theirs.There last tour in my opinion was their best.It remains to be seen how these songs will play in concert.U2 and springsteen are my favorite rock artists.Bruces last cd was disappointing to me but it had two great songs-Marys place,City of ruins and several very good songs.I am missing what everyone loves about this album.I cant reccommend this album  at all and I am wooried about their upcoming concert which I was so looking forward to seeing.I am a prince fan too and his musicology cd which got great reviews was in my opinion a throw away.If you folks like m&m-his latest cd is very good.I also got several new concert dvds.David byrne from talking heads is nothing special-meatloaf live in Australia is excellent,Also cyndi lauper live is excellent.
B0006284JQ|4.0|As I said, you will love this CD if you are a Britney fan. I am a Britney fan, and I do like this CD. Some of the songs aren't that great, like \\"Boys\\", \\"Overprotected remix\\", and \\"Outrageous\\". The best ones are \\"Crazy (The Stop Remix)\\", \\"Baby One More Time\\", \\"Oops I Did It Again\\", and \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\". I wouldn't exactly call it a \\"Greatest Hits\\" album, more of a \\"The Singles\\" album. I have the DVD to go with it, and I love it. If you are a Britney fan, you should definitely buy this. If not, maybe it's best you stay away....
B00005JN2Z|3.0|Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise did a very good job acting.  The plot was good however the last thirty minutes was very unrealistic.  After a car crash without wearing seatbelts, Foxx and Cruise are still able to run after each other.  Even when Cruise is shot in the face, hardly any blodd continues to squirt out of his face and Cruise still has enough strength to jump onto the back of a moving subway train. very unrealistic and these movies need to be realistic.
0783230710|4.0|Actually, the 'cropping' seen on the DVD was also on the laserdisc, letterboxed VHS, and theatrical editions of the film.  This was also evident in films like \\"Terminator 2\\" and \\"The Matrix\\", where films are shot in fullframe 1.33:1 and later reframed to either 1.85:1 or preferably 2.35:1 theatrical aspect, thus masking the top and bottom of the picture.  A lot of directors like to use this format, one: because it is easier to frame a shot this way, and two: they are thinking of the afterlife the film will have on video and how little differences there will be in the positioning of the shot.  Rather than have panning or scanning as with the Panavision format, Super 35 can exist in both fullscreen or widescreen without actually panning or scanning.  The only difference is that the widescreen edition actually masks the top and bottom of the screen in this case. <br /> <br />Still, the fullscreen edition can reveal mistakes, such as a certain 'bug' disappearing and reappearing in 'The Matrix', or going back to 'Pee Wee's Big Adventure', a certain endless bicycle chain coming up through the bottom of the box containing the chain.  Without the bars masking the top and bottom for proper framing, unwanted things are often revealed and, quite frankly, there is too much headroom and the shot isn't framed properly.  Whether you see more on the top and bottom in fullscreen versus Super 35 widescreen, seeing more isn't necessarily better or for that matter, proper. <br /> <br />Stranger still are some cases in which Super 35 alternates between cropped shots, like the ones some have complained about versus the fullscreen version, and true widescreen.  For example, another Super 35 film, 'Fire in the Sky', is almost all Super 35 cropping, until we get to the expensive 'alien abduction' scene. Here, there are closeups that are clearly cropped when compared to the fullscreen edition intercut with shots that do in fact show more picture information on the sides of the frame.  The shot of the alien sneaking up behind Travis Walton only shows Travis Walton in the fullscreen edition, excluding the alien from the shot.  In 'Terminator 2', during the 'nuclear nightmare' scene, the wide shot of the blast wave remains still in the widescreen version but pans to the left in the fullscreen version.  It's a give and take process, where most shots in widescreen Super 35 films are cropped but then you get shots that are definitely in true widescreen.  Still, this was how it was seen in theaters and therefore this is the film seen properly. <br /> <br />I'd say the only complaint about the Apollo 13 DVD I would have is that it's a lousy first generation transfer.  At the time, the new advent of DVD looked amazing.  Now with improved technology, the transfer looks terrible, with lots of artifacting, lack thereof detail, and yucky colors that recall the grotestque laserdisc transfer of '2010'.  Also, though the DTS track is nice, it sans extras whereas DVDs made today wouldn't have that kind of pressing problem.  Hopefully the upcoming anniversary edition will clear up those problems with a nice new transfer.  But for now, one must settle with the disc available, and yes, it is properly framed in 2.35:1 and it is not incorrectly cropped in the way some would like to think it is.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|Despite the rather corny title, 'Shaun of the Dead' is a funny and often brilliant, even intelligent spoof on horror films, in this case, zombies in particular.  The story is almost the same as George Romero's (or Zack Snyder's) one.  An Englishman Shawn working for an electronical shop wakes up one morning, and finds that everybody is acting weird.  The difference is, however, he does not find a makeshift shelter in shopping center -- but in a pub named 'Winchester' where he goes with his pal Ed who loves TV games. <br /> <br />That's it, 'Shaun of the Dead' is filled with British humor, peppered with occasional pop culture references.  It understands the rules of so many zombie films, and twists and uses it for its own purpose to make us laugh. <br /> <br />The film, as is the case with intelligent films, works as off-beat comedy.  See one incredibly hilarious scene where Shawn, himself being 'in the weather' because of the last night's booze, walks in the street, not noticing at all that the town has already been full of the zombies roaming.  Among them Shaun keeps on walking, not realizing the emergency around him. <br /> <br />Or think about this; 'What do you do when you find a zombie strayed into your garden?'  Shawn thinks the femele zombie is just drunk, or fooling around (why not?) until he and Ed do realize that she is a real thing. <br /> <br />The writer/director team is, I was told, behind the British TV show called 'Spaced.'  Unlike these lucky UK viewers, those audiences living outside the country probably may not know the faces of the actors (except Bill Nighy, middle-aged rocker in 'Love Actually'),  But that doesn't matter as long as you love this genre -- horror or spoof. <br /> <br />I find the latter half is slightly weak when the film starts to run short of its initial clever tricks.  But the ending, which is quite original, would makes it up for the loss of creative energy that keeps up the entire film several notched higher than usual spoofs.  I don't say it's genius's work, but is often makes us feel like that, especially in the first half.  Enjoy this brainy horror/comedy.
0786890754|4.0|I read P.S., I Love You almost immediately upon receiving it, having heard about it second hand and anticipating the originality of the concept. That of a widow opening letters from her beloved after his death...<br /><br />The concept is very original, the characters for the most part likable and the writing better than average. this is a first novel for this author, so I am cutting a little slack on my rating due to that. Had this been written by a previously published author, I'd probably only give it three stars and even as now, if there were a 3 1/2 star, I'd have picked that option.<br /><br />I did enjoy the book and at times it nearly had me in tears which I think is a sign of a really good book. However, just when I would begin feeling really involved with the characters there would be something I found awkward, that interrupted the fluidity for me. This happened at several points throughout the reading. There were at times a somewhat juvenile feel to parts of it. The main character would begin feeling very well rounded to me, then with the turn of a page felt hollow, her actions contrived and her reactions ingenuine..<br /><br />That said, I would still read more by the author. I feel Ahern does have talent as a writer it just hasn't been completely brought to the surface. Reading the interview with her at the end of the book, brought to light some reasons that it did not fully satisfy. This was not only the 22 year old authors first attempt at writing a novel, but the entire book was completed in 3 months. It also was approved for publication by HarperCollins UK based on 10 chapters. All this, I think contributed to the book being less than it could have been had the author taken more time with it. It is my feeling that had the author not been the daughter of Ireland's Prime Minister, this book would still be awaiting a publisher.. that is not to say that it isn't a good read or that it didn't deserve to be published but your average first time author would have had to perfect it before receiving such a quick and wholehearted acceptance..<br /><br />I will say that I am impressed with the depth of emotion illicited by the characters created by this very young author, when she admittedly has never experienced anything remotely like the events in the book personally.it before receiving such a quick and wholehearted acceptance..     I will say that I am impressed with the depth of emotion illicited by the characters created by this very young author, when she admittedly has never experienced anything remotely like the events in the book personally.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|I was really looking forward to this dvd, especially since there was no theatrical release in my area. I was extremely dissapointed by the presentation of this otherwise visually stunning film. The cover art is simply terrible, any screenshot from the movie would look a dozen times better. Also, while dreamworks said they didn't record an english language track to respect the original work, every modern anime includes both tracks to let the viewer decide. It just seems like lazyness to omit what has become a standard in american anime releases. Add the fact that there are NO subtitles in a traditional sense, only vastly inferior and distracting close-captioning, and you have what can only be considered a defective product.
B0001ZX0OW|4.0|Without a doubt MYSTIC RIVER's biggest highlight is the outstanding performances. Maybe I'm not that bright but I was shocked in the end. I just didn't see that coming.. MYSTIC RIVER starts off pretty slow. In the last hour it does pick up and you come to realize that the slow start was a necessary part of building around the films climax. If you watched the Oscars you know that MYSTIC RIVER was highly nominated in just about all categories. Many of the actors were nominated. Sean Penn won the Oscar for best actor in a leading role. Tim Robbins won the Oscar for best actor in a supporting role. Both actors were astonishing. Marcia Gay Harden was also superb as Robbins wife torn between what she hopes and what she believes. Her facial expressions alone made for a brilliant performance. Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne, and Laura Linney all round out the cast providing note worthy support. The movie at its core is really a dramatic who-dunnit. Credit must also be given to Clint Eastwood for his keen direction and perfect balance of so many complex characters. Even though I watched the Oscars and saw that the film was highly renowned.. it took me nearly a year to get around to sitting down to watch it. I'm glad I did, I thought it was a very good film.
6300267997|5.0|Can't believe there is no DVD. Have over 20 Streisand albums and this is my favourite. Those who do not like the songs have heard them less than a few times. The lady is a genius.

B0002DKCMG|1.0|Tasteless trash trying to titillate teens!NOT recommended for anyone with real family values or hopes of avoiding the pitfalls of the path of satan.This movie says alot about the morals of young people all around the world.Teens who would make fun of a curious and intelligent young man who wants to see churches in europe.Teens who would drink alcoholic beverages illegally at unsupervised parties.Teens who would engage in incest while under the influence of an illegal substance.Teens who would use violence against a street performer to earn money.The list goes on and on until this perversion is completed when you need to scrub your skin with hot water to cleanse yourself of the layer of filth it leaves upon the mind body and soul.The sole star is for the brief but welcomed geography lessons.
B0002B55WA|1.0|I was sent this DVD incorrectly.  I ordered the other version which at that time sold for $24.99.  This DVD would not play in my DVD player.

B0002X314C|5.0|This album is beautiful. Honestly I have been playing the album for more then 2 months now. A friend had a bootleg copy that matches the store bought album song for song. From the moment I heard this album I new it was a classic. Although I had it for more then 2 months I still went out and bought the store version the day it was released just to show love and support the artist. Songs like live it up, number one, and I can change show how deep he can get as a vocalist and a lyricist but keep the album fun. The production by Kanye West is some of the best west has ever done. In todays world of crunk say anything music its refreshing to see an artist come out and be different. Even R&B has been taken over by hip hop now but this album stays true to the artist as he sings each song and does things his way. If your looking for music to simply shake your a$$ in the club to with a bunch of hip hop artist yelling over the tracks then this isn't the album for you. If you want a true r&b artist who sings songs that you can relate to and makes them sound da_n good then please buy this album.
B000060MWU|5.0|I rate this movie 5 stars, but I rate this DVD 1 star. Why the hell isn't this movie on regular DVD special edition? This is another case of a movie which is extremely entertaining and different, but cannot be found on DVD unless it is bought as an import.  <br /> <br />Lost Highway is movie that doesn't exactly make sense, but because of the acting, directing, creativity, and direction of the film, is a grade A movie. Bill Pullman does an excellent job acting, as usual as one of the main characters in this movie. The story and plot has a couple of holes, but overall the movie is a lot better Drama than most out there. If you are looking for imagination, perfect acting, and something different than the usual, look no further than The Lost Highway.  <br /> <br />THIS MOVIE NEEDS TO BE RELEASED ON DVD AS A SPECIAL EDITION 2 DISC SET. IT'S AMAZING THE STUDIO HAS NOT DONE IT YET BY THE YEAR 2004.
038551123X|3.0|First, the good news...this is an interesting book with an unusual premise that, for the most part, is carried off well.  There aren't many books told from the point of view of a criminal - Lawrence Sanders' Bernie Rhodenbarr and Keller the hit man are two that come readily to mind - but I know of no other protagonist who is a serial killer.  Lindsay has taken this rather odd concept and has created a novel that generally works.  Dexter is witty, introspective, and somewhat charming; it's to Lindsay's credit that he has created a character that is rather appealing despite the fact that he is a murderer.  The author gets around this by having Dexter kill only those who allegedly deserve it, a fairly dubious argument. Indeed, the two people that Dexter actually murders during the course of the book were individuals who preyed on children, which somewhat stacks the deck. <br />    Nevertheless, the book is a welcome change from the usual serial killer genre and Dexter's chase for another serial killer is a rather lighthearted romp given the topic.  Unlike other critics, I found Lindsay's alliteration to be fun and not at all tiresome.  He made Dexter a witty narrator and at times I found myself chuckling out loud. <br />    However, there are two caveats that keep me from giving the book more stars and recommending it completely.  First is the unfortunate character of Dexter's sister Deborah, who comes across as whiny, shrewish, and generally unpleasant.  I hope that if Lindsay writes more Dexter novels, he will rethink her character and make her more believable.  As it was, she just didn't ring true as a person or as a police officer. <br />    My second reservation concerns the ending, which seemed rather abrupt and a little disappointing.  Up until the end, I was caught up in the story and very anxious to see where it was going.  It seemed to me that Lindsay had set up a fascinating scenario with an intriguing central character only to run into the same situation as many other authors - what do I do for a big finish?  The outcome didn't really ring true - which may be silly to expect in a book narrated by a serial killer - but the ending, to me, wasn't worthy of a book that, up to that point, was rather charming. <br />    Still, if you are looking for something different, you could do far worse.  I am actually looking forward to Dexter's next adventure.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|Though this Michael Mann thriller never really answers the question a friend of mine asked of it (i.e., \\"Why does the killer need a taxi when he could just rent a car other than to explain the title?\\") and has holes in the logic of its story, COLLATERAL is a solid, fun movie that just keeps moving, getting more and more twisted and interesting. Tom Cruise gets the showy role of contract killer Vincent and proves himself more than worthy, but the great Jamie Foxx, in many ways, steals the movie out from under him as Max, the hostage cab driver. It's a gritty film. The digital camerawork, which can weaken the impact of some films for me, is one of COLLATERAL's strengths, adding to its mood and keeping things uneasy and weird.
0395389496|1.0|Waste of money, waste of time, and waste of a movie experience. I can sum up the plot of the story in one word: \\"Believe.\\" That's all you need to know. It's the same message found in Miracle on 34th Street (pick a version), and a million other Christmas/Santa movies. The story was dumb. I could print all of the words in the book on my hand...in big letters. There was no depth...just a stupid kid who gets on a train with a stranger. There's a good message for kids. The artwork was fantastic, though. I can see how the story needed to be fleshed out to make the movie, but I can't imagine how they made an hour and a half or so out of a book that took me less than five minutes to read.
B00006AL1G|4.0|Picked this up for AU$10 (about US$7.80) in the bargain bin at \\"Crazy Clarks\\" and for that it's good value. I have to agree with other reviewers here who state that some of the more important influences were skimmed over. For example, no mention of Grandmaster Flash's \\"Wheels Of Steel\\" - both the man and the track being very influential and pioneering. Nowhere near enough of Kool Herc either. Also, what's with the spelling errors on screen - \\"DXT\\"?? It is \\"DST\\" as in Delancey Street, there are quite a few of these careless errors which challenge the DVDs credibility somewhat. <br />It does seem overly biased towards the current/recent scene but perhaps that footage is just more accessible to the producer. <br />Not bad for 10 bucks, but I suspect that price is indicative of the fact it's not the best DVD of it's kind. <br />
6305897786|5.0|Looking for a dark, entralling - perhaps even a little diabolical - mystery? Don't miss this one! <br /> <br />This is one of my favourite movies and one of few movies I have viewed many times. The story follows a ruthless 'book-detective,' Corso, on a fairly routine job that becomes more enigmatic, sinister and deadly as it progresses. <br /> <br />The atmosphere is deliciously dark but not frightening. The script is economical and tasteful, the dialogue natural and light, the acting convincing. Witty and humorous at times, too. <br /> <br />But wait - there's more! Wojciech Kilar's soundtrack is superb, it really conjures the right emotion and contributes greatly to the film's overall success. (Don't listen to it alone at night - it's really powerful;) <br /> <br />It is a very clever adaptation of the novel The Dumas Club, and, in many ways, is more entertaining. (See my review of the book.) <br /> <br />In short, highly recommended, it'll have you glued to the edge of your seat - each time you watch it.
B00005JM0B|2.0|I think even Arnold agrees that this sequel should be the end since he is now \\"Governor Schwarzenegger\\", but in actuality he should've stopped at T2. The original Terminator is one of my favorite movies. The original was more of a horror movie with innovative ideas and a fantastic plot. The first sequel was a financial blockbuster whose FX were on the cutting edge at that time. The sequel was not scary or suspenseful, instead it was just this huge sci-fi spectacle that expanded on the original idea. Both movies can exist on their own merits. However this second sequel is totally unnecessary. THey are grasping at straws trying and struggling to come up with something new in this movie. FOr example the Bad Terminator is now a model chick called the TX! Wow! What's next a Terminator dog? The opening is almost an exact replica from T2, except that THIS time Arnold doesn't go into a biker bar it's a male stripper bar!! Oh the originality! Arnold is still a Good Terminator sent to once again protect John Conner. Here is where this movie falls apart. The actor who plays Conner does a poor job. His leading lady played by Claire Danes is just as bad. This is the couple who are suppossed to save humanity? We're in trouble! I would rate this movie as being OK. I certainly don't recommend buying it, if you can find it cheap and are a completionist then maybe otherwise save your money and just buy the original and the first sequel only.
B00005JMYI|4.0|Ok, I am not a big comedy person, but this was a funny movie. It is stupid, but funny. Ferrell is great at playing these kinds of characters and the huge amount of cameos in the movie keeps it entertaining. It runs out of steam towards the end, but the bloopers shown during the credits will make sure you are laughing when the movie is over. It probably isn't for everyone, but it is funny. It never tries to be anything but fun. There is a great \\"West Side Story\\" like rumble between news stations that borders on Monty Python funny which is saying a lot for Ferrell. You also have to love the Jack Black and Ben Stiller cameos. I wouldn't put it down for a sure Oscar winner, or even my favorite movie, but it is worth a 3 buck rental.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This is a jarring, violent, uncomfortable film, depicting the last, horrible hours in the life of Jesus as a deluge of suffering and sacrifice. I am not religious, and I don't agree with several of director Mel Gibson's political stances. But THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is a brave, risky, harsh film that knows exactly what it's trying to do and does it well. It doesn't look away from the harsher aspects of its violence, for it's trying so desperately to communicate the feelings of pain and grief to its audience and move them. In the midst of Jesus's long walk to the cross, at one point, Mary is shown weeping for her son, thinking of him as a boy. That moment in the film, where Jesus is shown at his most human, is, for me, when it's most touching. Like SCHINDLER'S LIST before it, THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is not at all fun and may be too difficult to watch more than once, but it's a tremendously effective, smart piece of cinema.
044024157X|2.0|I would probably rate \\"The Last Juror\\" as 2.5 stars, but since Amazon won't let me do that, and since I am absolutely certain that John Grisham could have done much better, I'm going to round down rather than round up.  This is a plodding novel with an obvious plot and a not-very-satisfying ending (no spoilers here).  It is a decent read for a boring rainy afternoon, or a warm afternoon at the beach, but that is about it.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this is the story of a very bad family in Mississippi who are involved in moonshining, drugs, etc.  One of the family scions commits a dreadful rape-murder, and is sentenced to life imprisonment.  He vows to seek revenge on the jurors, and sure enough, when he is released the jurors start getting shot or killed.  More would be telling, except that there  is not much more to tell.<br /><br />The story is told from the perspective of the owner of the town newspaper owner/editor.  Grisham almost manages to make this chap an interesting character (Grisham is not known for the three-dimensionality of his characters) but he fails.  Mostly the  protagonist-editor relates a series of endless meals with the family of one of the jurors.  He manages to make this boring too.  The novel goes off on all kinds of tangents about news reporting of the civil rights movement in the 1960s South, and later the struggle between megastores (i.e. a thinly disguised clone of Wal-Mart) and mom-and-pop storefront stores.  This is mildly interesting, but has absolutely nothing to do with the plot, and nothing to do with the characters either.  Basically it simply represents Grisham on various soapboxes.  Maybe he gets paid by the word; that is all I can think of.<br /><br />By the way, Grisham can usually be depended upon to at least write an interesting narrative of a trial.  Not here.  Here the trial is one dimensional and caricaturistic--never was there a more reprehensible villain or less suspense as regards the outcome.  He could have summarized the trial on a page or two and entertained the reader no less.<br /><br />I gave it 2.5 stars because Grisham's prose is not bad, and the novel did contain some interesting insights about life and news in a small Southern town which was interesting to a Southern California boy like myself.  But this novel seems to have been written to make Grisham's Mercedes payment or something.  It had little to say, and managed to take 500 pages to say it.  Entertaining, but that is all, from an author capable of better.mmarized the trial on a page or two and entertained the reader no less. <br /> <br />I gave it 2.5 stars because Grisham's prose is not bad, and the novel did contain some interesting insights about life and news in a small Southern town which was interesting to a Southern California boy like myself.

B0002X314C|5.0|I picked this CD up on last night and I can't be any happier with this project. I love the tracks and his voice. He reminds me of Anthony Hamiliton a little but better. I encourage you all to get this CD ASAP. You can hear his upbringing in church through his voice and I know if he ever record a gospel album, it will be bangin. Good Work John Legend.
0679777547|4.0|After thoroughly enjoying the movie 'The Ninth Gate' by Roman Polanski, I felt compelled to read the book behind the movie. My impulse was - if the movie was so good, the book can only be better! <br /> <br />The book was an engrossing read. The dark, mysterious atmosphere prevails throughout, as it does in the movie. I would recommend the book in its own right, but I found the scriptwriters' adaptation of the book to be a far more potent and unified story.  <br /> <br />The two differ in a number of ways (don't worry, no spoilers below):  <br /> <br />1. The film reworks many characters, particularly that of Balkan.  <br /> <br />2. The book contains two plot threads (the Dumas manuscript and the 'Nine doors' book), whereas the movie focuses on one - the more intriguing one, in my opinion. The movie is very economical and direct, traits not as evident in the book. <br /> <br />I found myself admiring the scriptwriters' work of sifting the 'relevant/important' material from the 'peripheral/distracting' and still managing to capture the book's feel, and occassionally even dialogue. The characters in the film are more powerful and driven. I'm not sure how well a script more 'true to the book' would have translated into film. <br /> <br />3. On the other hand, the book has a philosophical depth lacking in the movie, specifically the idea of 'the Devil in love.' One is almost moved to sympathy. Eventhough this formed part of the main plot thread, it has no mention in the movie. <br />Also, the 'Dumas manuscript' plot thread adds a lot of interesting detail into novel writing and manufacture in those days. <br /> <br />4. Lastly, I found the ending of the movie more satisfying than that of the book. <br /> <br />In summary, the book is an enthralling read, deliciously dark and mystifying, with food for thought too. Fans of the movie may find it a little disappointing but, at least, an interesting background to the movie.
B00004VXF2|5.0|From the day of its release, this album has been notorious.  Usually it gets labeled as 'unlistenable white noise,' and many dismiss it as an unfunny Lou Reed joke.  I disagree.  The groaning, howling, screeching drone started to mesmerize me about ten minutes into the album and I listened to the entire thing in total bliss, completely immersed in that incredible sound.  I'm not a Lou Reed fan and I know next to nothing about music, so I think this album can be enjoyed by anyone if it is approached properly.  Don't fight it, don't try to liken it to anything else, don't analyze it, just let yourself be overpowered by its might, and remember that everything is music.  Your anger and pain will melt away with its fierce beauty.     I have to agree with the critics when they claim that this album is a precursor to industrial and ambient music.  It isn't exactly a precursor in its actual sound, but in concept. 'Metal Machine Music' was one of the first rock albums to seriously consider the possibilities of white noise as entertainment, as well as the use of electronic manipulation and distortion.  Whether or not a listener finds the album appealing is irrelevant - it's an album that needed to be made, and one that opened up new areas in rock music, ultimately making it more interesting, especially to 'outsiders.'
0767834739|1.0|This is the sequel to 2002 first Resident Evil, which is based on the popular video game series. The movie starts right where the first one left off and you don't have to worry about them messing up any of the plot points because there is no plot to either movie. Instead of plot, you have Jovovich and a few other people running around shooting, stabbing, punching, exploding and basically killing every kind of zombie that happens to cross their path. It is nothing but non-stop action and explosions the perfect thing to watch if you are trying to fall asleep. The zombies spread their plague by biting their victims which makes you wonder why Jovovich and the other women in the movie run around in shorts and tank tops. You could ask, but remember there is no plot so just let it go. Unlike King Arthur, where I was told no one wants to watch a movie with ugly people in it, Resident Evil is filled with ugly people. Really ugly people. It tanked at the box office so therefore, the ugly people rule must be right. The ending leaves the movie wide open for a third installment and I know everyone will be holding their breath until number three hits the big screen.
B0002IU988|4.0|For those that don't know, Alter Bridge is a new group comprised of Mark Tremonti on guitar (from Creed), Scott Phillips on drums (also from Creed), Brian Marshall on bass (yet again from Creed) and Myles Kennedy on vocals (from Mayfield Four). So as far as the members go, yes, it's basically Creed with a new singer. I purchased this album on the day it was released over 4 months ago, but I waited to review it so that it would receive an accurate critique.<br /><br />The CD is great all the way through, plain and simple. If you liked Creed, then I assure you that this album is a worthy purchase. Although the band insists that they are headed in a different direction than Creed (which does seem to be true), musically, it sounds the same. The album opens up with the heavy cruncher \\"Find The Real\\" and sounds like something you'd hear from a metal band like Godsmack or Down. The next song, \\"One Day Remains\\" is my favorite on the album because Mark's guitar work is simply jaw-dropping. Then there is the album's first single, \\"Open Your Eyes\\", and although the song didn't really take off, it really is awesome. It's probably the most Creed-sounding track on here, even Myles' singing sounds similar to Scott Stapp. \\"Metalingus\\" is another rockin' tune with a heavy-metal guitar intro that sounds like something from Roth-era Van Halen. On \\"In Loving Memory\\", the song starts with a guitar-lick that is so similar to something you would hear on a Creed album, you forget that you're listening to a new band. This happens again on \\"The End Is Here\\" when Mark plays a riff similar to that of Creed's \\"Faceless Man\\". I hate to make so many comparisons to Creed, but when you have 3 out of 4 members in the band, it's gonna sound practically the same. Also, you can't deny that Mark Tremonti's guitar style is so destinctive and so unique, that no matter where he goes musically, you're gonna hear Creed. As for Myles, he has many similarities to Scott Stapp as a singer, but I can tell he isn't trying to mimic his style. Myles generally hits really high notes, while Stapp generally sang lower.<br /><br />So is Alter Bridge as good as Creed? In terms of talent and song-writing skills, yes they are. However, Creed was original when they came out, and for years delivered us 3 great albums. So it's hard to compare a brand new group to the most successful rock band in the last 6 years, even if 3 of the members are in it. What this group needs is time, and a chance. People need to listen with open ears, and appriciate this group for everything they have to offer, which is a lot. I saw the group in concert this past October, and was really blown away. Rather than playing an epic rock show with big props and pyro...they performed a really intimate show, just the band and their music. And rather than having this I'm-a-big-bad-rock-star persona, they acted like 4 cool guys, jamming out some tunes on stage and having a good time. They were more friendly and interactive with the crowd than any other band I've seen.<br /><br />These guys are for real, and even though they probably won't attain the same status as Creed, they have every bit as much to offer.n't trying to mimic his style.

B00020HEG6|4.0|if you collect soundtracks. I personally loved this score. I thought it was brilliant in way possible and it's all I want to listen too. <br />However, I was a little disappointed with the order on the album it's self. For instance, \\"Bucbeak's Flight\\" is a whole five tracks before \\"Hagrid the Professor.\\" I may just be being picky, but I usually like it when a soundtrack mirrors the film. <br />Either way, if you are a fan of the series, you'll really enjoy this.
B00065JTBA|5.0|I got this boxed set for Christmas and was able to listen to all four cd's on a long drive home.  What a great set!  The perfect addition to any Bon Jovi fan's collection!  Having been a Bon Jovi fan for almost twenty years, I can honestly say that it is a real pleasure to listen to all of these songs that didn't quite make the albums.  Some are vintage Bon Jovi, others are a complete left turn from the norm, but all of them are great!  I especially liked hearing Richie Sambora and David Bryan take a turn at the lead vocals.  A must have for any Bon Jovi fan! <br />
0064407667|3.0|I give this book an A for over all concept.  <br />I give this book an F for the authors treatment of its audience. <br />The general story is good and keeps you entertained enough.  <br />The author needs to stop under estimating his readers. At the oddest times the author finds it neccessary to give a definition to a work or words. It got to a point that I think the other was just trying to get up to a certain word count rather than try to tell a good story.  <br />Thanks to series like Harry Potter, many kids are finally reading. If a child can get thru Harry Potter with out needing to pick up a dictionary or ask thier parents a question about a word they certainly dont need either for this series. /rant off
B000002KO1|5.0|The best output from this classic lineup (PII a strong follow-up) and it still has the same crap mastering from it's original CD release twenty years ago! This is criminal to say the least. Superb record worthy of a fresh remaster job or a hi-res release. If someone at Rhino reads this, know that it's not just me crying out for a better sounding \\"Pretenders\\" (and Pretenders II for that matter)!
B00064MW6A|5.0|Critics started puting this movie down before it was even released! It's not that bad, it's at least as good as any of the other comic book movies and beats hell out of some, such as \\"Hell Boy\\". Not everthing Halle does is going to be in Oscar level.
B000000OSE|3.0|I still thought this album is actully really good, Appetite is  a great combo to this album, and Use Your Illusion II. It has  the best my favorite song, November Rain. Lots of songs were good but they seemed to be more out of control. The best tracks  on this I think were 'Live and Let Die', 'Back off Bch', & 'November Rain'. If you want to see how good these others are.  Here's what I feel about every single song.     1. Right Next door to hell: okay, but not a single. still great  for opening. 25/100    2. Dust and Bones: This is muchly Izzy on this track. 22/100    3. Live and Let Die: What a great intro. Paul McCartney cover  with a great ending, and vocals rule!!! One of the best. 89/100    4. Don't Cry: This track is a skip track. This is the weakest song on the entire album. And is probably the weakest song that  GNR ever recorded. This song makes you cry too much. 2/100    5. Perfect Crime: Nothing to do with this track. It's just ugly  vocals are not impressive. 18/100    6. You Ain't The First: This track is too slow. Give it a no  rate. 3/100    7. Bad Obsession: A little different. 40/100    8. Back off Btch: This song is very good. I give it a rate. Matt  Sorum did great drums in this tarck. And the guitars are heavy.  One of the album's best. 92/100    9. Double Jive Talkin': Good startout, it's such a slow acoustic  ending. 31/100    10. November Rain: This song is so awesome. This is the greatest  song I think GNR ever did, ever. It's my favorite song on this  entire album. I love how Slash does great riffs in the end with  great drums by Matt. Axl rules on vocals! Almost 9 minutes of great music! Typically my favorite song of all time next to Sweet  Child O' Mine!!!! Best on the album ever, ever!! 100/100    11. The Garden: After the long November, this is a song you get  to know about the garden. I'm not a big fan to this one. 36/100    12. Garden of Eden: Ouch!!! This track is ugly, just like a song  which would be on Back in Black with lots of sex, drugs, alcohol,  violence and liquor. Not typically great. 10/100    13. Don't Damn Me: I love how Slash does guitars in this one. But  so far, this track is also mean too. Typically a song which would  be on Back in Black. 50/100    14. Bad apples: Whatever. 42/100    15. Dead Horse: This track actully starts out slower and better,  and then gets even better when you listen to it. And then ends  slow. 52/100    16. Coma: Okay, this is what is a closing album, it's so long.  Over 10 darn minutes. Well whatever! It's cool. 63/100    Overall it's actully one of GNR's best CDs but Appetite for Destruction is even better.     Thank you. William Vogt II:

If I have a question about designing a page, creating a navigation scheme, or writing user instructions, I keep the title of this book in mind. Don't make the user think if you can make something obvious. Use the traditional wording, such as Search, instead of something different. The user will know what to do immediately instead of thinking about what is meant by a different term. <br /> <br />We do the same on highways - all the Stop signs are boringly the same, but we all know what to do without thinking about it. <br /> <br />The book is also very entertaining and a quick read.

6305603847|4.0|Pink Floyd The Wall is in my eyes, a very good film. It is about a rock star who goes into a deep depression because of many hardships in his life, which makes him build a psychological \\"wall\\" between himself and reality. Based on the troubled lives of some of the band members of Pink Floyd, the rock band who scored and composed the music for this film. It is a uniquely made film using flashbacks to explain the troubled life of Pink (the main character), and some scenes which use very strange images (some animated) to symbolize some of the thoughts of the character. It is not at all a very happy movie, and in my opinion will greatly disturb some of its weaker viewers. But it is still a highly recommended film, especially for those who are fans of the band Pink Floyd, of whom I am very big fan, and for those who want to see a very unique style of film.
B00004T9UF|5.0|When Marshall Bruce Mathers climbed out of the underground and smashed into the mainstream with Slim Shady LP, his first album under Andre Young A.K.A. Dr. Dre's label, Aftermath, he was broke, on drugs, and wonderfully deranged.  Two years later, with the release of arguably the greatest hip hop CD ever created (by a white man at least), he was rich, on drugs, and wonderfully deranged.  They say he can't rap about being broke no more, but they ain't say he can't rap about coke no more.  And so there it was, an insanely pissed off Eminem created a masterpiece album with a masterfully crafted selection of 14 controversial, lyrically rich, catchy, and intense, raging tracks along with a couple of good skits and a couple of bad skits.  With the opening track, \\"Kill You\\", it becomes evident that the controversy surrounding Shady's first album wasn't enough, and \\"Kill You\\" serves as a perfect prelude to the powerful lyricism that is to come.  On the very next track, \\"Stan\\", arguably Eminem's most powerful single, we are introduced to an obsessive fan who yearns for attention and ends up killing himself and his girlfriend by driving off a bridge.  The message is strikingly strong, and coupled with a catchy Dido sample, makes a great song.  Eminem seems at best when criticizing those who criticize him, which clearly shows on \\"Who Knew\\" and \\"I'm Back\\", clever and catchy songs.  The two best tracks on the album would have to be \\"The Way I am\\" and \\"Marshall Mathers.\\"  On \\"The Way I am\\", Eminem is just on fire, with his anger just being lashed out like never before, and is the lyrical genius at his lyrical best.  In \\"Marshall Mathers\\", he combines a catchy guitar riff with some of his best words, complaining about how nobody ever cared about him before.  Other standouts include \\"Drug Ballad\\" and \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" and the album really closes with a bang in \\"Criminal.\\"  Lesser entries include \\"Amityville\\" and \\"Kim\\", the prequel to the great \\"97 Bonnie and Clyde\\" from Slim Shady LP, which are still good songs, but don't shine as well as the other tracks.  Anger is what fuels Eminem and makes him great, but \\"Kim\\" is just a little too angry and doesn't work as well as Bonnie and Clyde.  Overall, it adds up to Eminem's best album. EVER. <br /> <br />1. PSA 2000: Funny PSA, better than PSA from Slim Shady LP (no rating) <br />2. Kill You: Great controversial opening track, angry and catchy (4/5) <br />3. Stan: Most powerful song on album (5/5) <br />4. Paul: Short skit that serves basically no purpose (no rating) <br />5. Who Knew: Hilarious song where Eminem blames parents and not his music for kids' actions (5/5) <br />6. Steve Berman: Funny skit where sales agent has trouble selling Em's album.  Background music is What's the Difference from Dr. Dre 2001 (no rating) <br />7. The Way I am: Best song on album, and possibly in Eminem's illustrious career. (5/5) <br />8. The Real Slim Shady: First single from album, hilarious, upbeat, and catchy, but seems out of place in album (4.5/5) <br />9. Remember Me: Very little Eminem, not really fond of RBX and Sticky Fingaz part in this track, not a bad track but nothing special (3.5/5) <br />10. I'm Back: Another hilarious, catchy song, takes shots at critics and N'Sync, catchy chorus. (5/5) <br />11. Marshall Mathers: Pure genius.  Revealing, takes us into the mind of marshall Mathers (5/5) <br />12. Ken Kaniff: Uh... Just skip this skit (0/5) <br />13. Drug Ballad: Em talking about drugs.  Doesn't mean much but it is catchy. (4/5) <br />14. Amityville: Rhymes could be better (3.5/5) <br />15.B**** Please II: Star-studded and catchy (4/5) <br />16. Kim: Prequel to 97 Bonnie and Clyde: graphic and insane even for Shady's standards (3/5) <br />17. Under The Influence: OK track (3.5/5) <br />18. Criminal: Ends with a bang with great verses, catchy chorus, and a funny skit inside the song. (5/5) <br />
B000002LHT|5.0|The guy who produced this album also produces Motorhead's classic \\"Orgasmatron\\", and man, can you here it!  This is by far the heaviest Ramones album.  From the bump-and-run of \\"I Believe in Miracles\\", to the churning grind of \\"Don't Bust My Chops\\", to the almost thrash/metal \\"Zero Zero UFO\\", this album just rocks.  It also has a \\"classic\\" style Ramones song (the video was \\"dedicated to the fans\\") called \\"Merry Christams (I don't want to Fight Tonight)\\". <br /> <br />If you feel like you must get an album after \\"Too Tough To Die\\", then get this little ditty...you'll be glad you did!
B00003CWMI|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  I finally purchased my own DVD copy.  I plan to watch it over and over again!
B000002LIX|5.0|This album has the type of music that forces you to tap your foot or bob your head. Not only is the music \\"catchy\\", but the talent and creativity within are also very admirable. <br />Perry's vocals are high-pitched and different, but they work great with the music. <br />Dave's guitar playing is probably the main reason I got interested to this band. The unique sound is great, and some of the guitar solo's in songs such as \\"three days\\" and \\"been caught stealing\\" are great. All-in-all, Dave's guitar playing is almost as flawless as his wife's body.  :) <br />Eric's bass is great, and just like in Nothing's shocking, nearly half the songs on this album start off with some \\"querky\\" but \\"cool\\" bass intro. Great stuff. <br />Steven's drums are also very unique and significant. He uses many sounds that I have never heard before, and the percussions he uses fit in fine with the rest of the insruments and vocals.
B00006690G|5.0|Many wondered how Eminem could follow up such a magnificent marshall mathers lp.  Any doubts are quickly removed with \\"White America\\", yet another powerful opening track from Eminem.  The intensity stays around throughout the whole album and is at its finest in Cleanin out My Closet, a rap to his mother as angry as ever.  Characteristically, Eminem Show closes with a bang with My Dad's Gone Crazy, an intense lashing coupled with a catchy sample by none other than Hailie Jade herself.  (I'm pretty sure she's never heard this song) <br /> <br />1. Curtains Up <br />2. White America: Powerful lashing criticizing America and displaying Shady's effect on kids (5/5) <br />3. Business: Clever, Dr. Dre produced song which sound like a Batman theme mixed with the usual Em lyrical genius (4.5/5) <br />4. Cleanin Out My Closet: The album's most powerful moment, where Eminem is just tearing his mother apart in a rap (5/5) <br />5. Square Dance: Chorus is a little weird but a great beat and good lyrics make this a strong track. (4.5/5) <br />6. The Kiss: Skit where Em catches Kim kissing another man <br />7. Soldier: A lot of references to guns, a good track (4/5) <br />8. Say Goodbye Hollywood: Good lyrics with OK beat (4/5) <br />9. Drips: Surprisingly catchy song about STDs (3.5/5) <br />10. Without Me: Catchy first single of album, everyone knows it but it feels so empty without it (5/5) <br />11. Paul Rosenberg: Skit about guns <br />12. Sing for the Moment: Powerful song which mixes a good message with a killer \\"Dream On\\" sample (5/5) <br />13. Superman: Catchy sex song (4/5) <br />14. Hailie's Song: Slower and softer than most rap fans would like, but the song is sweet and revealing, nonetheless powerful and has a good rapping verse as well. (5/5) <br />15. Steve Berman: Skit where Em kills Steve Berman when he's dissing him <br />16. When the Music Stops: clever track with good beat (4.5/5) <br />17. Say What You Say: OK Track (3.5/5) <br />18. Til I Collapse: The most intense, lyrically rich, powerful non-single of 2002. (5/5) <br />19. My Dad's Gone Crazy: Hilarious and revealing song with Hailie walking in on Em when he's snortin some coke, and drops in a catchy chorus <br />20. Curtains Close
B0002BK9J4|4.0|This was a decent Ramones album as far as that goes, but $18 buck?  WOW! <br /> <br />If you fork out the dough, listen to \\"Poison Heart\\", \\"Main Man\\" (where C. Jay shows he can sing just like his big daddy, Dee Dee....duh!), \\"Strength to Endure\\" (hey, is C. Jay just an avatar of Dee Dee minus the really cool drug addiction and insane behavior?), the well done cover of the Door's \\"Take it As It Comes\\", and \\"Touring\\".  All the songs are decent, and Stasium was back at the controls as a producer,so the guitar sounds great! <br /> <br />But my GOD!  $18 bucks?  C'mon man, this is a RAMONES album, right?
B00000K3CK|5.0|This is a great movie,as many have posted before me. However, after hearing the classic radio show (heard it on Sirius)  originally aired around the same time as the orginal movie release, I learned something entirely new about this old classic I enjoyed for many years. In the classic radio show at the end when the lawyer talks with Santa about the house, he learns that Santa set the entire sanity trial up, Santa knew the lawyer could not afford the house unless he bacame a famous lawyer, and by going to trial it made the lawyer famous. I never realized that Santa set it all up by making them think he was crazy, but it makes sense that Santa could be that smart.
B000696PWC|5.0|The Girl is non stop.....as a professional DJ and mixer, this is the perfect driving CD, sure there are quite a few of her best efforts, when the USA was very unfamiliar with her \\"talent\\" However it still did not stop me from supporting her and purchasing this CD.  I honestly have almost every one of these tracks on other CD's, but I can just not get tired of these songs, they stick to you like glue.  In addition, the limited edition Pic 12\\" vinyl of \\"I Believe in You\\" is outstanding, she has strayed a bit from the mainstream \\"gay\\" club remixers, yet none the less, the remixes \\"Mylo\\" is great.  A great CD, but look closely, if you really like a song there is most likely a remix out there (pre 2000) mixes are the best, seldom released in the USA, until Can't get U outta My Head was her breakthrough to the states, and to this date I still won't let her outta my head <br />Jason33305@aol.com
B0006A9FMI|1.0|In the hope that someone from your DVD division reads these reviews, PLEASE immediately recall and put out a version of this title with NON-CLOSED CAPTION subtitles as you did for the theatrical release.  The current product is inexcusable. <br /> <br />And if I dare press my luck, you might think about not using such substandard C-grade cover art--what was wrong with the theatrical poster art or any of the myriad images supplied to you by Oshii's studio? <br /> <br />We are grateful to you for bringing such films to Region 1, but they deserve better treatment than this!
B000002L9O|3.0|I'm 38 years old, and I've been a die-hard Ramones fan since 1979.  I bought this album when it first came out, and, of course I loved it back then.  But, the older I get, the more I realize that the TRUE Ramones sound was defined on the first 8 albums, all of which have been re-released by Rhino with bonus tracks and demos on each cd.  The cds also have great liner notes about what was going on woth the band during the time they recorded the album. <br /> <br />Animal Boy has it's moments, as in Apeman Hop, Animal Boy, and Love Kills.  BUT, this album also had the weak stuff like \\"Something To Believe In\\" and \\"Crummy Stuff\\". <br /> <br />If you are an old time fan, then you might want this just so you can say \\"Hey, I got all the Ramones albums\\", but if you are just starting out, get Too Tough To Die and then all of the other re-issues. <br /> <br />Thanks.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|I've only been seriously listening to music for about 4 years, and Rage Against the Machine were one of the very first bands that I really got into.  Since that time, however, I've moved away from alt-rock or alt-metal almost entirely, listening to more traditional and lesser known varieties of metal.  I still considered RATM to be one of my favorite bands, but I hadn't carefully listened to one of their albums in a very long time, so I decided to go examine their catalogue more carefully.  I was kinda worried that they wouldn't completely hold-up, but it turns out that I like them better than ever before.  They play off of each other perfectly, Tom is still an amazing and creative guitarist, Zack is one of the most intense vocalists around, and Tim and Brad are a brilliant rhythm team.  I've had this cd longer than any other one currently in my collection, I believe, but listening to it yesterday it was still as alive and exciting to listen to as ever.<br /><br />Most people tend to think of the debut as their best album, and for the longest I would've agreed, but I now think this album is their best.  The debut is perhaps slighter stronger on a song to song basis, but the greater variety of sounds on 'The Battle of Los Angeles' makes it a more interesting and satisfying listen, taken as a whole.  Here RATM have tightened up their attack a bit, with shorter songs than on the debut, and more focused songwriting than on 'Evil Empire'.  Normally I like when bands stretch out a bit, but I think that the sharper, conciser form fits RATM best.  Stylistically, they've opened things up some as well, tracks like the particularly bass-intensive 'Mic Check' and the eerie, clanging 'Born as Ghosts' being little like anything they've recorded up to this point.  Nothing on this album is anywhere close to bad, but 'Voice of the Voiceless' is definitely the weakest track.  It's still good enough that it ought to be on the album, I think.  It's got plenty of classics, too.  'Testify' 'Guerilla Radio' and 'Sleep Now in the Fire' recall the debut's tracks, but in a looser, less metallic form, and they all rock plenty hard.(And, they showcase Morello's penchant for very groove-intensive, but still energetic riffwork, and some innovative sounds. i.e. the howling, metallic wind used for the 'Testify' verses)  'Calm Like a Bomb' has got lots of great basswork, and perhaps Zack's best vox on the album.(Zack's always great vocals are better on 'The Battle of Los Angeles' than on any of their other albums, imo)  'Born as Ghosts' is a very eerie piece, with truly fierce buzzsaw guitars.  'New Millenium Homes' is one of the 'rappier' tracks on the album, and it grooves very well, and has a great pre-chorus/chorus.  'Ashes in the Fall' is a longer more atmospheric work, but it's still sharply written, with particularly strong dynamics, piercing guitar lines, and some of Zack's most enraged vox.  'Born of A Broken Man' is one of the best track album tracks, with ghostly, incredibly evocative guitarwork during the verses, and the best riff on the album, during the chorus. (I particularly like it when they reprise the main riff, in an incredibly trebly form, just before the final chorus. Best moment on the album)<br /><br />Yes, great album here, equal or superior to anything you're likely to have heard on rock radio in the last 15 years.ify' 'Guerilla Radio' and 'Sleep Now in the Fire' recall the debut's tracks, but in a looser, less metallic form, and they all rock plenty hard.(And, they showcase Morello's penchant for very groove-intensive, but still energetic riffwork, and some innovative sounds. i.e. the howling, metallic wind used for the 'Testify' verses)  'Calm Like a Bomb' has got lots of great basswork, and perhaps Zack's best vox on the album.(Zack's always great vocals are better on 'The Battle of Los Angeles' than on any of their other albums, imo)  'Born as Ghosts' is a very eerie piece, with truly fierce buzzsaw guitars.

0446530891|2.0|An overwritten crime story. Cardboard characters. An over complicated story line. Flat and predictable dialogue. <br />Far out, unbelievable, motivations, and incredible criminal events.Totally non involving. Boring, boring, boring. <br />Wish I had the 5 hours ( wasted on the book )back. <br />Sorry that I seem so wishy, washy in my evaluation.
0671004611|5.0|I read the US Army's late Lt. Col. Corso's pentagon shadow-warrior's book with great interest. I agree with pundits that he had a checkered past in the intelligence community and was embroiled into the false propaganda about President Kennedy and Fidel Castro. He also dealt with post-WWII shennanagins with OSS/CIA in making deals with the NAZI devils like NASA's Von Braun, Kammler, and CIA's Gehlen. Prince Machevelli would be proud of our shadow-warriors as they have \\"proven\\" that \\"the ends REALLY DO justify the means\\" (Note: sarcasm). <br /> <br />Let me just say that 1947 was a very noteworthy milestone in world history. However, I absolutley do NOT believe that we were ever visited by \\"little gray men from Mars\\", or anywhere else. This Roswell \\"alien-vistor\\" thing is mostly believed, albeit secretly, by our present government and openly by the civilian UFO'ers. In our government's strange deference to it's blasphemous faith in this new kind of \\"deity-like\\" visitors, whom incidently our forefathers never knew, our government is trying to \\"sloppily-on-purpose\\" keep it under wraps. They (US government employee sponsored/membership: The LSR Fund, Stanford, NASA, Disclosure, CSETI, SETI, etc.) endulge the faithful gullible-minded UFO \\"experts\\" which keeps this UFO enigma going so the great \\"Godless\\" deception continues. <br /> <br />However, I do believe as does Nick Cook (ex-military-weapons-reporter from Janes.com) that all of these gadgets Phil Corso spoke of came from NAZI Germany during the end of WWII. IMO - You would be surprised what is still considered \\"classified\\" by UK/US from this time period of high-strangeness. You may ask OK, then were did the NAZI's get these fancy gadgets from? Well now that's the $64,000 question as Groucho Marx would say! Some \\"faithful\\" UFO'ers speculate that the NAZI's had thier own REAL Roswell-like incident in the summer of 1938 in Czernica Poland. Then, IMHO, afterwards their metaphysical occult worshipping NAZI scientists hada literal deal with \\"you-know-who\\" to help them reverse-engineer and develop new these so-called \\"otherworldly\\" gadgets even WMDs! Did they REALLY \\"know\\" what they had? Obviously not! As Hitler did not even exploit them effectively against the allies and win WWII as Hitler seemingly tried to do with the ill-fated Deuterium \\"heavy-water\\" Bomb, V-weapons, and the ME-262 jet fighter! Maybe the Divine opposite of \\"you-know-who\\" negatively manipulated Hitler's thinking processes as \\"He\\" did with Pharoah Ramses II thousands of years earlier - read Exodus.  <br /> <br />How does anyone know that the NAZI's had secret weapon gadgets of WMD proportions? Well just talk to any elderly OSS agent that went into Pennemunde, the Hartz Mountains, Lake Garda, Mauthaussen Camps, etc. Talk to any surviving Jew that was a child of a Jewish slave at the Mauthaussen Camps - BERGKRISTALL - \\"crystal town\\" - Guzen II caves. The late Kriegsmarine Commander Schaeffer of the surrendered missing U-Boat U-977 in Argentina in August 1945 spoke of Himler's SS being in charge of \\"death ray guns\\" (i.e. lasers?) and other amazing WMD gadgets that they were still trying to understand by end of the war in May 1945. Schaeffer wrote a book \\"U-977\\" in where he mentions this and was later criticized for his book by his surviving pro-Nazi buddies.  <br /> <br />No I don't believe that we are being visited by other worlds, \\"yet\\". However, I do believe they are out there but we are NOT on their present interplanetary travel itinerary yet as we are not yet worthy of the hazardous expedition as we are WAY too dangerous to interact with. For instance, just look at our television broadcasts (our calling card) over the last 80 years (first was the \\"Great Train Robbery\\"!)! Then NASA sends a gold video disk on Voyager that has a suspected NAZI war criminal greeting any alien culture that figures out how to play the darned thing.  No, IMO our Roswellian visitors are more closer to home maybe even more \\"biblical\\" in nature than the common UFO'er or \\"special\\" technology shadow-warrior could appreciate or even understand. <br /> <br />I personally agree with the late Fleet Lord Admiral Peter Hill-Norton (UK Royal Navy). He truly understood \\"who\\" the REAL culprits behind this massive deception of gullible humans who are like the \\"blind leading the blind who both fall into the pit\\" of inaccurate knowledge. <br /> <br />BTW - Phil Corso accidently mentions a alien-contributed \\"time machine\\" in a documentary for a British producer. How coincidental is it that shortly after that \\"accidental\\" admission by Corso a very famous university in Storrs Connecticut gets government funding and is actually working on a \\"real time machine\\"? If you don't believe me that a university would actually work on such a seemingly silly Hollywood sci-fi gimmick, look it up yourself! Google this: UCONN TIME MACHINE <br /> <br />Spooky
1592400876|4.0|It's uncommon to imagine a rather funny book on the subject of punctuation.  Lynne Truss goes through all of the most common punctuation marks, gives us their history, and makes them all seem interesting too.  (For instance, in the preceding sentence, the comma after \\"history\\" is called the Oxford comma: it is standard in American usage but not in British.)  This is not a book on grammar: Truss claims to believe that a subordinate clause is one of the elves who help Santa.  However, she is a stickler for punctuation: especially the misplaced apostrophe used by greengrocers! <br /> <br />This is a book written by a Brit, so it is interesting to note the difference between American and British usage.  For instance, what we call a \\"period\\" is the \\"full stop\\" in the UK. <br /> <br />This might seem un-fun, but trust me - there are no quizzes at the end of each chapter.  The rules are explained in layman's terms (I hope I wrote that correctly) and it is all a good read.  You may not be a perfect punctuator by the end of the book, but you'll be a better one. <br />
B00000JQFM|5.0|Joe Satriani is the ultimate guitar hero.  He has amazing chops, incredible melodic vision, and also fast, unbelievable shred skills.  This album shows in a very inspiring way what an amazing musician he is.  If you are a guitar player or have a good ear for talented and thoughtfull music, then you should pick this one up in a heartbeat.
B00009RAJH|4.0|Absolutely amazing album.  Though this album is still not as good as Rumours, it is extremely close.  You can tell that this band was on to something special by infusing Mick Fleetwood and Stevie Nicks into the already amazing group.  With the extra tracks added to the disc, it is definitely the version you want to buy. If you already own the disc, it may not be worth the money to buy the remastered disc, but at the same time no one could fault you for wanting the extra tracks and updated sound this disc brings.  I am listening to it as I write this review - you can't help but tap your feet to the beat of \\"World Turning\\" - I dare you to try and not do it.
B0002YLC24|1.0|It's funny how reviews from different sites differ so much.  Here on Amazon, a majority of the customers gave this movie a great review.  However, on blockbuster.com, most of the customers gave this movie a very lousy rating.  I have to agree to with the blockbuster.com customers.  This is one of the dumbest and most boring movies I have ever seen.  This movie is 80 minutes long, and that is supposed to be considered a short movie.  However, this movie was probably the longest 80 minutes of my life!  Even 10 minutes is too long for this movie.  All you see is two people talking to each other.  The cafe scene was way too long.  Then they start walking around Paris and talk to each other about their lives and their relationships.  This is supposedly a \\"romantic\\" movie.  I don't see that.  The guy is married and has a kid.  The lady has slept around with who knows how many men.  And this is supposed to be romantic?  The ending doesn't help either because we cannot determine what's going to happen.  Does the guy go to the airport?, or does something else happen?  An overall lousy movie from beginning to the end.  This movie isn't worth renting either even if you do wind up getting it free.
630463949X|4.0|First let me say that I loved FM's performance.<br /><br />Unfortunately the pictorial record of the fabulous show is marred by Bruce Gowers' video editing.<br /><br />It's obvious that a fortune was invested to provide dozens of camera angles.  Unfortunately Gowers decided that the view needed to shift with every downbeat and at the first word of each verse.<br /><br />As a result, continuity is lost.  We watch, for instance, Christine sing two words then the camera suddenly shifts to Mick.  Just as suddenly it shifts back to Christine at the first word of the next lyric line.<br /><br />Obviously, every member of the band deserves to be featured, but each song also deserves to be anchored to a performer then illustrated with wides, close-ups, two-shots, and group shots.<br /><br />Landslide is performed beatifully, and we catch glimpses of the potentially electrifying interaction between Lindsay and Stevie.  But Gowers ruins the moment with discontinuous shots from floating cameras and close-ups of instruments.  Suddenly we notice tears in Lindsay's and Stevie's eyes at the end of the song.  It would have been much betterto amplify the emotion-packed song with soft camera work and discrete editing.<br /><br />To better understand my point, compare John McColgans simple video of \\"Riverdance\\" to David Mallet's over-produced jumpy edit of \\"Lord of the Dance.\\"  One is elegant and a joy to watch. The other is disturbing and hard to enjoy.<br /><br />Nevertheless, \\"The Dance\\" concert is magical, and despite the flaws of this video production I recommend its purchase.
B00005JNLY|5.0|I like dark, meaningful films that count as course credit or a visit to church.  My son told my wife and I to choose this over our other choice for the evening, \\"Meet the Fockers\\", but mine was the swing vote and even though \\"Spanglish\\" had a title as frothy as 'Fockers' I sided with my son's moview savvy. The film had a good many of the elements of a light flick e.g. cute kids, a shaggy dog and a somewhat bumbling genius Dad.  But its major theme (this is a very funny comedy) is integrity.  The film had parts that only one part of the audience laughed at and there were parts in which the laughter was united.  I laughed and towards the highly conflicted ending I cried.  It was the kind of film that left you in silent awe.
B00005OM4K|5.0|Or is it \\"live\\"? I can never figure out if bands are plural or singular. <br />This is a great box set, though. All of Creedence's classic 60s and 70s recordings, and the best fidelity available. A really good booklet, too, and the early pre-Creedence material is often surprisingly good, even if it lacks the originality and maturity of the hits. <br />Not the place to start, I guess, but serious fans will want to pick up this excellent compilation which genuinely adds to the Creedence legacy. John Fogerty's swampy rock n' roll is some of the finest, most literate and most enjoyable rock music ever, and some of the most memorable as well.
B0002X314C|4.0|I'm going to keep this simple. <br /> <br />When Anthony Hamilton's album came out, my friend called him \\"The Truth.\\"  Well, Anthony pales in comparison to John Legend.  This album is the most real and soulful album by an urban artist since Songs in A Minor by Alicia Keys.  Simply awesome.  Cop it!!
B00005UKE0|4.0|Harrison in his introductory notes (2000) to this collection states, \\"I would like to liberate some of the songs from the big production that seemed appropriate at the time..\\"  Well my thoughts exactly...And there is a bit too much in your face Vedantic lecturing..I remember listening to my sister's copy of this album when it first came out...it was in the gray Portland rain and I wondered about time, space and the perfect red lips at the time  ...My impression at the time was, there are several really good songs here but this is not an album I would listen to over and over...So in putting on the headphones (tonight) and zeroing in on this version, I feel pretty much the same except this could have been the best of the post Beatles albums...The big production numbers by way of Phil Spector are way too much-- often sounding like a mix of George Martin and an East Indian Kazoo on coke...too much going on that just drowns the songs..Course \\"My Sweet Lord\\" is still uplifting and vibrant...Dylan's \\"If Not For You\\" begins to liberate the album...But what makes you realize how good this coulda been are the outtakes that were not overly drenched in this crazy schlock...For instance on \\"I live for You\\"  Pete Drake's steel guitar just resonates with celestial wings...So if Spector was not there and a couple of the overtly in your face songs were deleted, this coulda been a stellar album...Thank God for the outtakes, some of which are instrumentals that rock with Eric Clapton's guitar work...George was an extraodrinary artist...his playing still resonates yesterday, today and tomorrow...
B00000K0EA|2.0|Action without substance. The behind-the-scenes problems really hurt this movie and it shows. Nobody seems to be having much fun in this movie as they race from one lame action sequence to another. Whereas the following movie had too much substance, this one has hardly any at all.<br /><br />We do have to face a morose 007 chasing after some truly ugly women (only the Danish professor has any appeal), some cardboard cutout Oddjob wannabee (Stamper) and the least interesting, menacing or sinister villain of the series (Carver). Even the plot is rather boring - Britain and China go to war, woohoo, I mean who cares if they do or not?!<br /><br />Whereas the action is handled better than in TWINE, it is still lame and flat. I suppose we were supposed to find some sadistic glee as (James Bond, curiously jumping back from the death of a woman he professed to love very quickly) is seen grinning like some crack-induced schoolboy as he remotely controls a car around a parking garage. Then his apparent disregard for innocent passerbys as he sends the (potentially lethal) weapon hurtling down to the streets below. What a moron!<br /><br />Replacing the great score by Eric Serra, we are instead served up a paint-by-numbers score by David Arnold who doesn't appear to have an original bone in his body, relying instead on plagiarising former tracks and the criminal overuse of the James Bond theme. It is unforgiveable that instead of giving us something original. Arnold instead spoils for all-time such an iconic piece of music.<br /><br />It's hardly surprising that Mike Kitchen decided not to show up in this movie (he probably saw the script and did a pass on it), but we do have Desmond Llewelyn looking like Santa Claus in a ridiculous red car rental uniform.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I am compelled to write this review because I'm so bummed by the one star reviews and harsh words of some other reviewers. I must defend Napoleon! This is my favorite movie of 2004, possibly my favorite movie ever.  I am an educated, intelligent, mother of three.  My 12-year old daughter and I are crazy about Napoleon Dynamite-every time we watch it, we are doubled over with laughter.  I suspect this is one of those movies you either love or hate, there's no middle ground. If mainstream humor is more to your taste (I'm thinking Austin Powers or, uh, I don't know, that kind of thing), maybe you should skip ND.  But if you want to watch something subtle yet side-splitting, off-kilter but sweet and safe to watch with your kids, this is your movie.
006441034X|4.0|Fairy tales, by and large, adhere to some very strict and undeniable rules.  Amongst these is the rule of three.  If a household contains three children and there is a fortune to be made, that fortune will be attained not by the first or second children (who are doomed to fail simply due to their birthdates) but by the third.  Fairy tales are filled to overflowing with stories about third children.  It doesn't take too much imagination to see how much more interesting it is to read a story about a first child instead.  In \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" author Diana Wynne Jones pays tribute to the great folktales of the past by turning them topsy-turvy upside-down.  The book is an amusing picaresque mystery tale about a girl's attempts to remedy her newly ancient state.<br /><br />Sophie did not mean to upset the Witch of the Waste.  It's just one of those things that happens.  After working in her stepmother's hat shop for months on end, Sophie's somewhat remarkable workmanship attracts the unwanted attention of a very nasty sorceress.  For what appears to be no reason at all, the Witch enchants Sophie to become the age of ninety, or so.  With a newfound sense that she no longer need worry about what people think of her, Sophie blossoms in her new state.  Just the same, she'd like to get her old body back, and so it's off to the Wizard Howl (a man reported to eat the hearts out of young girls) for a cure.  Hopping a ride on Howl's remarkable moving castle (hence the book's name) she befriends the not-so-evil but undeniably vain sorcerer, his apprentice Michael, and their snarky fire demon, Calcifer.  What follows is a race to escape the witch, free Calcifer, and figure out just exactly what Howl does or does not know about his new senior citizen servant.<br /><br />The book's a remarkable combination of styles.  You have your fantasy, your fairy tale, your mystery, and your subdued but nonetheless present romance.  Jones has always been a fan of fantasy stories in which the tale will suddenly produce one heckuva twist 80% of the way through.  \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" is no different, and the twist (while something anyone other than myself could probably have seen coming a mile away) is a shocker.  The best thing about the book though is the easygoing relationships between the characters.  Once Sophie settles down and makes the castle her home (while she tries to find a way to get her old body) she develops a wonderful relationship with Howl, Michael, Calcifer, and any other random people who might stop by (like a dog-man or an enchanted scarecrow, perhaps).  Like many of Jones' heroes and heroines she's completely unaware of her own remarkable abilities.  If there's any continual theme present throughout Jones' works, it's the idea of knowing oneself.  Sophie doesn't, and until she discovers the extent of her own remarkable qualities, she's doomed to putter about.<br /><br />It's a great idea too, making the heroine of a tale sixty or seventy years older than she should be.  Howl, for his part, is a great character if a little dodgy at times.  He's as vain as a peacock, often appearing as a slightly wittier version of Gilderoy Lockhart from \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\".  His transformation by the book's end was, needless to say, straining the boundaries of credulity.  Just the same, you can't help but fall in love with this story.  Yes yes, it kinda falls apart near the end with so many subplots, red herrings, and sudden characters cropping up here and there that you either lose track of what's going on or reread every paragraph three times over just to get your bearings.  Jones has a tendency to rush her endings, and the ending of \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" works at a breakneck speed.  I wish she'd lingered a little longer over the happy ending too.  Once the danger of the book has passed, everything gets wrapped up in a neat little bow quicker than you can spit.  I would've liked a little luxuriating in the characters' newfound happinesses, but you go with what you've got.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" is bound to please both those Diana Wynne Jones newbies out there who've never so much as glanced at a word of hers before, and those tried and true stalwart fans who methodically gobble her books up like so many Pac-Man pellets.  I wouldn't name this as my favorite of her stories (hats off to \\"Archer's Goon\\" for that honor) but I did have a wonderful time reading it.  If you'd like a book that is a joy to read and won't do anything but please you, select this one immediately.  It inspires movies, it entrances children... it is a spectacular tale.s' newfound happinesses, but you go with what you've got. <br />  <br />All in all, \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" is bound to please both those Diana Wynne Jones newbies out there who've never so much as glanced at a word of hers before, and those tried and true stalwart fans who methodically gobble her books up like so many Pac-Man pellets.

158799190X|2.0|Hmmm...there are so many things wrong with the ramble, that it is hard to know where to begin. Taleb is at his best when decribing traders, but as a bearish bitter put buyer who has seen all of those dream teenies go out worthless, it is disingenuous to seperate the world into niederhoffers and talebs...there are plenty of the rest of us in between, and frankly, most traders make most of their money jobbing in and out of trades over short periods of time. Also, really guy, no one cares how many times you go to the gym. Honestly...Finally, for someone who professes not to care about the media, and pseudo-academics, he has a lot of quotes on the back cover from his friends in academia and finance...coincidence, or maybe his only black swan.....PS why the trashing of MBAs...sorry Wharton was so disappointing for him, maybe he should have sold a few more puts and gone out boozing with friends  a little more....
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I just received this DVD as a Christmas gift and, honestly, popped it into the player about 20 minutes after I had unwrapped it.  I was very, very young when Live Aid took place and had only seen bits and pieces of the day before getting the DVD.  While I have to say that I was disappointed that a lot of music was evidently cut from the broadcast, what is included is breathtaking, maybe not always musically but definitely in the \\"Oh, wow\\" factor, as in \\"Oh, wow, look how young they were\\". <br />My far-and-away favorite is the Queen set which, thankfully, is included in its entirety (and rightly so, as I'm sure there would be an uproar if anything was cut from this legendary performance).  Since I had never really seen a lot of the other artists' performances I never understood why everyone usually says Queen stole the show.  Now I see why, in comparison to a lot of other sets (though U2 was stunning, and Phil Collins's \\"Against All Odds\\" was wonderful).  Seeing those thousands of pairs of hands clapping in unison to \\"Radio Ga Ga\\" was enough to stop my heart for a second, they simply rocked the world that day.  Well, everyone knows who their favorites are so I'll get off that topic. <br />What also impressed me was the way the event was put into proper context with the additional material included before the concert.  The videos for \\"Do They Know It's Christmas\\" and \\"We Are The World\\" really took me back...even I can remember hearing nothing else on the radio that year.  But the video news footage was mind-blowing.  It literally brought me to tears, even though the footage was 20 years old.  I just wasn't old enough to understand the enormity of the situation back in 1984.  I must say that it made me take a good look around at my pile of boxes and wrapping paper under the tree and thank God (just like Bono says).  Good move on the part of those who put this DVD set together to include that, it reminds us why the whole thing took place.   <br />This DVD set is a treasure, pure and simple, and was well worth the wait.  I recommend it to any music fan (or nostalgic, for that matter!).  Buy it, watch it, sing along.  It's well worth it. <br />

0767834739|2.0|This movie is quite gastly when compaired to the first resident evil,I mean this movie hade a cheese factor of 8 out of 10 it is quite obvious that there was a differant director who made the movie. if you like the games then stick to the first movie it's much better and so is the video transfer, for some reason they gave this movie a really bad transfer, none of the blacks are black and the color is washed out I was fooling around with my color and brightness controls throughout the whole movie.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JNLY|4.0|A film by James L Brooks<br /><br />When Flor's (Paz Vega) husband leaves her she is forced to emigrate from Mexico to America to find work so she can support herself and her daughter Cristina (Shelbie Bruce).  After initially finding a lower paying job in a Mexican enclave within Las Angeles, Flor finds work as a housekeeper for Deborah (Tea Leoni).  Deborah is a wealthy, self-absorbed society woman who doesn't really think of the feelings of other people.  She is also absolutely crazy in a manic sort of a way.  Her husband, John (Adam Sandler) is the normal one.  He is a very successful chef and will soon be an even more successful chef when a top critic gives him a fantastic review.  But, he is a committed family man who deeply loves his daughter Bernie (Sarah Steele) and while he must love his wife for some reason, he is very frustrated with her because her callous disregard for the feelings of Bernie even though Deborah thinks she is doing the right thing.<br /><br />Into this strange, messed up family comes Flor.  She is gentle, and kind, and she doesn't speak a lick of English.  Translation and communication comes through Cristina, stuck between the excitement of a new way of life provided by Deborah (she treats Cristina better than she does her own daughter) and the steady tranquil traditions of her mother.  The conflict of \\"Spanglish\\" comes in the form of Deborah.  Deborah will whisk Cristina away for a day long excursion without asking permission from Flor.  Her hurtful comments towards Bernie is upsetting John almost as much as Bernie.  Deborah is paying little attention to her own husband or to her family except as they might relate towards her and her wishes.  It is no wonder that we see a budding friendship (could it be more?) between John and Flor.  John, like Flor, is gentle and kind and loving and is being hurt by his wife far more than he deserves.<br /><br />There is no true narrative here in the sense that \\"Spanglish\\" does not directly follow a storyline.  What we have is a movie about the relationships between these characters, most of whom are very likeable.  The crazy thing is that we want John to leave his wife because we know that he would be very happy with Flor and that they would treat each other well.  We want their children to get the love and attention they deserve.  We know that Flor's presence has been nothing but a good thing to John's family and that she is a positive influence with how steady and responsible she is.  If there is a villain here it is Deborah because she is just so unlikeable, yet at heart she must be a good person for John to have married her in the first place.  We only barely see glimpses of her heart, though.<br /><br />\\"Spanglish\\" has quite a bit going for it.  The movie has a stellar cast which also includes Cloris Leachman has Deborah's alcoholic mother Evelyn.  Leachman has all the best lines in the movie and I will be surprised if she doesn't pick up an Oscar nomination for her work here.  She steals every scene she is in.  The idea of an alcoholic mother could be a very harsh character, but in \\"Spanglish\\" Evelyn is so good natured that one could almost believe that it was Deborah that drove her mother towards the bottle.  Another highlight in this movie is Cristina's translations of conversations between her mother and John.  Not only does Cristina translate the words and the passion of Flor, but also the gestures and so we get a bit of perfect physical comedy with a younger girl saying very adult things.<br /><br />The only real problem with \\"Spanglish\\" is that despite the strength of all of its parts, the film itself doesn't come together to make a whole that is nearly as good.  We have a film about several wonderful characters working through their problems, but it doesn't amount to very much.  I can't explain it.  \\"Spanglish\\" is a nice movie, a decent movie and is filled with a certain amount of heartwarming material, but perhaps because of Deborah and the conclusion, it never really delivers the promise or the pedigree of the filmmakers.  Grade: B-<br /><br />-Joe Sherryrah and the conclusion, it never really delivers the promise or the pedigree of the filmmakers.  Grade: B- <br /> <br />-Joe Sherry
B0006A9FMI|4.0|Amazing film! The visuals and music are stunning.  An interesting mix of traditional and CG animation.<br /><br /> Now as far as people complaining about it lacking an english dub.. It amazes me that anyone one would complain that a foreign language film is presented unaltered in it's original language.  Dubbing a foreign film to english takes so much away from a film.  Have you ever listened to an american film that has been dubbed with different actors?  It is an insult to the director, actors and the viewing audience when a film is butchered with dubbing.  I can't watch dubbed Anime or Foreign films due to the acting of the people doing the dubbing is so monotone and lifeless.
0393035158|5.0|Iconoclasm can be a little too easy, but can redeem itself when it has something urgent to get across. This book, if at times a little brusque and a little short on nuance, exists to reassert the profoundly important point that faith isn't an adequate foundation for beliefs about the world, and thus works marvelously as a work of timely iconoclasm. Clinging to assertions about the ultimate meaning of life and the destiny of mankind based on the authority of ancient texts written by desert primitives is, in an age of suitcase-borne nuclear weapons, an invitation to unspeakable disaster.<br /><br />Harris asks: If we accept that one man rose from the dead to bear the world's sins, upon what basis can we deny those who assert that another man dictated the word of god before ascending to heaven on a golden chariot?<br /><br />Abandon reason, and what is left to rebut the zealots of a competing faith? Harris reminds us that the defining feature of the men who carried out the 9/11 attacks is not evil, but faith. Whatever else they might have been, these were believers who were convinced -- based on faith, tradition, and the circumstances of their upbringing -- of the righteousness, indeed the holiness, of their deeds. Evidence (or its absence) did not trouble their \\"moral clarity.\\"<br /><br />Harris minces few words in calling attention to the dangers and shortcomings of faith, particularly in its Islamist and Christian fundamentalist forms. This is a book well worth reading, one that boldly defies the glad-handing of faith that has become, certainly in the USA, the mark of manners in public discourse.<br /><br />Bracing and refreshing, this book vigorously denies the form of reasoning that says, in effect if not verbatim, \\"it is so because my religion says so.\\" Not only is this not good enough, Harris says, but it is positively dangerous; and we must insist on higher standards for the sake of humanity going forward.
1400034779|5.0|I agree with what everyone else says about this book and the others in the series.  Anyone can write about a mystery in New York or Miami or London.  However, to take the readers to Botswana, where most of us have never been, and bring the place to life with a marvelous character is truly unique. Mr. McCall Smith is able to communicate beautifully the setting for the story in such a way to bring it all to life. His development of the stories and characters is excellent, making you want to keep on reading his books. I'm sure many of his other works are just as wonderful, I think I will just have to read them too!
B00005T7I1|4.0|Not Dennis, but Edward Hopper, painter of lonely souls in harsh-lit diners. Well worth a watch, if only for its wall-to-wall ugliness. Beatty does a great impersonation of Elliot Ness, aka Robert Stack, who had the most immobile features in the business. This is history: how the American mid-West dream was destroyed by urban corruption and big-city values, and, of course, Prohibition. An object-lesson in the way pure comic-book stereotypes can make you think a bit. Someone said this film was disturbing. It is. Nietzche and Plato are defeated by simple family values. Who wrote these songs ? Was it Sondheim, or someone else called Elfman?  Madonna is great, but the songs just seem ordinary, to me. I guess Sondheim is an acquired taste I haven't acquired yet. Great cast, great acting, very unusual design, direction, many good lines and all that, but all over a little too hideous to swallow in the end. Mutton stew gone cold.
0671027344|2.0|I wouldve given this book 3 stars out of 5, but the more praise i keep hearing the more it made me feel like it deserved less then that. The story itself is somewhat cliched, but very relatable to for anyone around the same age as the protagonist. The constant comparisions between this book and catcher in the rye are also somewhat irking. This book isn't really like catcher in the rye. The only thing they have in common is that they were both written in first person through the eyes of someone around the same age. But really, its not like Catcher. This book was a quick read, but what annoyed me also were the constant references to things such as the band Nirvana, and The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Now, i'm a fan of both of these, but i felt it was somewhat limitting to the audience. It seemed somewhat pretentious to mention, and the author could have given the basic message without explicitly referencing specific bands or movies. If the audience is not a fan of either, they may become somewhat alienated from the protagonist. For literature's sake, its just best not to mention. <br /> <br />Some parts of the book shine, such as the poem that the protagonist writes, or the opening paragraphs. There are however, other parts that seem too vulnerable and at times pitiful. The protagonist in this book is not as sharp or self gaurding as holden caulfield, and the constant comparision was a let down. If you want to read a modern book more like catcher, i would suggest  either A Separate Peace, or Sloppy Firsts. Although the latter does make mention of a few movies, its not as mentioned in the story as references are in Perks.
0790729652|3.0|I remember the huge anticipation for this movie back in the Summer of 1989.  And for me, I remember what a letdown it was when I finally saw it.<br /><br />Tim Burton, the director, has a unique visual style, and his movies are always interesting to look at.  Burton is great when working off a strong script (e.g. \\"Edward Scissorhands\\"), but he's a weak storyteller left to his own devices: unfortunately, Batman has a rather bland story.  Even worse, Jack Nicholson as the Joker steals the show from Batman (as played by Michael Keaton).  Keaton is a fine actor, but I believe he was simply too old to play a young Batman; and his low-key performance is easily overshadowed by Nicholson's.  The 1992 sequel, \\"Batman Returns\\" has similar faults.<br /><br />\\"Batman Forever\\"(1995) is the best of the four Batman movies, which isn't saying too much:( Hopefully, the upcoming \\"Batman Begins\\" movie will learn from the mistakes of its predecessors...<br /><br />If you want to see a great superhero movie, then try the first two Superman movies (1978, 1981) and \\"Spiderman 2\\"(2004).
B0000C8AVR|5.0|The 1965 release of \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" represented the beginning of Bob Dylan's artistic chameleon act that continues to this day. In four short years the man from Minnesota had established himself as the leading light of the folk music scene, yet he was more than willing to gamble that reputation with this bold and groundbreaking effort.  It is impossible to understate the significance of this recording. The opening track, \\"Like a Rolling Stone,\\" proved that a hit song could be longer than two and a half minutes, therefore paving the way for many of Dylan's \\"contemporaries\\" to expand their artistic horzions. In spite of his seeming departure from the folk scene, Highway 61 boasts great lyrical depth and intensity. For this recording, Dylan displays his remarkable songwriting prowess and amazes the listener with his mix of poetic devices and cunning wordplay. Every track has its own merits, but the disconsolate brilliance of \\"Desolation Row\\" and the haunting \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\" are my personal favorites. Amazon says that Highway 61 is an 'essential recording.' More specifically, this album is THE essential recording of Bob Dylan's spectacular career and remains one of the most important rock records ever made.
0767834739|1.0|I'm not a videogame nut, so I guess I missed this film's 'good' points.  The only redeeming qualities \\"Resident Evil-Apocalypse\\" has going for it are CGI effects and stunts.  Nonexistent plot, lousy dialogue (lots of cursing), women running around half or completely naked (while all the men are fully clothed).  Even the zombies were far better done in the recent remake of \\"Dawn of the Dead\\".  Milla Jovovich has yet to make an impression on me in any film she has been in.<br /><br />Movies like this one seem to assume that videogame devotees aren't intelligent enough to deal with such things as decent story, good acting, etc.  Judging by some reviews on this site, maybe the producers of 'Apocalypse' are right.  1 star, and that's stretching it.
B00005JMUA|3.0|I've read reviews saying the KILL BILL VOLUME 2 is better than KILL BILL VOLUME 1, but I beg to differ.  I honestly thought that the cinematography, scenary, plotline, and etc... were all more exciting and better in the first volume.  I think VOLUME 2 suffers what most sequels suffer, the fact that VOLUME 1 is stronger. This was by no means a terrible movie, it is as ambitious as all Quentin Tarrantino movies go, but it just is boring compared to VOLUME 1.  Is doesn't have the same pizzazz, so to speak. The acting from all the actors is a plus and doesn't suffer in quality in VOLUME 2, and there are still some positive plot-related thing, such as the surprise ending (which I won't spoil), but otherwise, this is merely average compared to VOLUME 1.  Maybe it is because VOLUME 1 was so strong (or atleast strong compared with QUENTIN TARANTINO standards), but here it lacks. 3 stars.
B00008973Q|5.0|If you thought Seven Samurai was a masterpiece, you aint seen nothing yet until you've seen RAN.  I recall Sydney Pollack's character in Woody Allen's Husbands and Wives coming out of the theater with the bimbo woman character trying to explain that this was Kurosawa's King Lear...Yes, somewhat based on Shakespeare's work but very Japanese in nature.  The use of color, direction, cinematography, and acting all KICK BUTT!!!<br /><br />From Lady Kaede to Saburo to Hidetori--all standout performances.  I love this film.  I get chills just hearing the soundtrack before and during battle scenes.  A truly awesome feat of cinema.
B00005JMEW|4.0|This is one of the most ambitious movies on the market I believe. It is a trademark Tarantino movie, with tons of cursing and an odd plot line. The plot does finally make sense after a while. The scenery, costuming, and fight scenes are all very well done and help make the movie itself a little better. This is by no means an oscar worthy movie, but it is an interesting watch.  3 1/2 stars

B00005JN0T|2.0|This movie was a disappointment.  If you aren't a science-fiction fan (and maybe if you are) you don't want to see I, ROBOT.  It is one of those movies that is slow to get the least bit interesting and truly escalates at the conclusion of the movie. While Isaac Asimov was a great science-fiction writer, I, Robot in its movie version just doesn't cut it.  Not even Will Smith can lighten this bland movie, with the exception of the ending.  It just lacks in being a truly exciting movie.  It seems like for a while it is a mix of drama and science fiction, and then here comes comedy relief from Will Smith.  It is way overhyped and could've definitely been better. 2 stars.
014028009X|2.0|The initial review of the novel that I had written was very, very scathing. After a bit of thought, I decided to edit it.     No, I did not finish reading the novel. In fact, I was so repulsed by it that I threw it down and refused to read further. But after a while, I realized that the reason why I am repulsed of it is not because of the fault of the storytelling itself - it's pretty well-written - but because I could not relate to the main character.    Bridget is a self-pitying thirty-something woman caught up in various woes because she cannot be satisfied in being single at her age (among other things). For some who relate to Bridget,  this novel is hilarious and relevant. For others, Bridget just irritates them because they see her as weak - possibly, I believe, for being a representation of the things that they had set out against at a certain point of their life.    Age may be a factor in determining whether you will like the book or not, and I would dare to say that the level you find Bridget appealing is almost directly related to how much importance you put on sexual and romantic relationships, which of course, would be something on your mind for quite a bit if you're single and thirty.      Conclusion: you'll either love it or hate it. Don't jump to buying it anytime soon, you'd probably end up very, very irritated.
1928733018|1.0|Please, for the love of God do not buy this DVD. It was sent to me when I signed up for an online portfolio service, so I did not have to pay for it (thankfully). I did however, sit and laugh for 45 minutes. This thing had to have been done in the 80's. While it was a good opportunity for the featured model, I couldn't help but feel sorry for her. She never smiles through a whole scene, instead going between \\"This is fun!\\" to \\"What is this guy talking about?\\". It's almost as if someone is sitting off to the side going smile, don't smile, smile, stop smiling, smile, look off into space there dear! If you want to know anything about the industry, take it from me: Ask a real person who does any kind of print work. Go ask your local photographer. Just don't waste your hard earned money on this DVD.
0812550706|5.0|This is my fovrite book ever! i love how it has so many levels of understanding. For example, you could read this book as a fourth grader and love the fact that Ender saves the world and all the plot twists, etc. But then you could read it again in eight grade or so and love it for the depth and the internal struggle that Ender faces. For anyone who loves depth dispersed throughout a witty plot, Ender's Game is the book for you.

0767834739|4.0|Not oftern does a sequel surpass the first.  This IS one exception.  More characters from the game appear in this one, and there is a lot of action.  It's non-stop, a rollercoaster ride into hell and back.   <br /> <br />Cast performs well.  The critters are great.  In a year full of good zombie films, this one stands out on its own.  The plot is more complex than the first.  Project nemesis is in full throttle and our heroes now have a new enemy to battle as well as the flesh eating ghouls.  For horror fans, lotsa blood and goo.  For actioneers it's even better.  lottsa fun.  Eat popcorn, press play, enjoy.
B0006399FS|4.0|This album requires repeated listenings to appreciate. I found that after the 20th listen everything started to gel, and now I believe it is one of their finer recordings. I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could.

6304698690|5.0|There is always a place you want to call your own.  In this film adaptation of a beloved children's classic, that place is a garden hidden away on the estate of a bitter widower and his sickly son.  With the arrival of a young orphan to the estate, the long neglected garden becomes the sanctuary for the young orphan and soon her care of the garden brings new life to those around her.  Beautifully filmed and acted.  The garden appears magical and as scenic as any pastoral painting.
B00005JNJ7|3.0|Well, South Park has gone Thunderbirds in this puppet comedy by Trey Parker. Team America are an already established group of freedom fighters who are fighting terrorisim around the world, and new recruit \\"whats his face\\" is having some trouble adjusting.    Much like the original Thunderbirds series, this is a bit of a poke at a few movies, Thunderbirds / Star Wars I picked up on easily, theres probably more.    The movie like I said is a lot like South Park, even the same SP voices are heard all through the film. I have to say, I expected Trey and Matt to come up with somethign absolutly hilarious with this film. Sure, it did have a great speach at the end, and a funny love making scene with 2 of the puppets, but I truely think they couldve made it a much funnier movie, cause at times, it was...well, almost like a serios movie!!! I dont know if thats a compliment or insult to Trey?!     Overall, it's an ok film, I hope when it's on DVD there is tonnes of bonus features that will get my thumbs up to buy.     ======    Update: 7th June 2005    I've just watched TA on DVD and it looks and sounds great. I kind of missed the point that it was meant to be an action film more then comedy, so i guess i was in a state of miss interpreting on my first reveiw. The movie is fun, but I still find it a 3 and half star comedy. I understand now that it had a huge production and wasnt the easiest of films to make, but i do agree with something Trey and Matt say in the bonus features, it was definitly time to make a movie that didnt use CGI and go back to an old school process, and i couldnt agree more.    The extras are a bunch of featurettes, ranging from storyboaring, intervewis, behind the scenes etc, plus the usual trailers, and some deleted scenes that arnt hard to work out why they where cut out. But i'm a bit disapointed, I thought Try and Matt would have some ideas for hilarious extras, like interveiws with the puppets, or an actual deleted Jabba The Hut scene that Trey isalways going on about as a joke whenever he can. And i'm very suprised there is no audio commentary.     Still a good movie to own, gonnah be interesting watching it from now on and looking for little props made of things lying around the house!

The confused hero and heroine striving to understand the few clues tossed their way are here.  No fewer than two secret or sort-of-secret societies are also included here. The religious angle adds zest to the story but the story in no way depends on it.  We can only hope that the host of evocative little 'facts' (like Friday the 13th being unlucky because a pope tried to irradicate the Knights Templer on one or that 'villain' comes from 'villager') will someday be sorted through and we will be shown which are real and which fabricated - I'll bet most are real.  A note - if you don't take kindly to the Christian church tradition being scrutinized you may want to pass on this one.  Not to worry though about the Christian spiritual tradition, it comes through fine.  The four instead of a five is because of a relatively weak ending - they should have consulted with Ludlum.
B0002X314C|4.0|John Legend's CD is very original without taking on that \\"artsy, spoken word, poetry\\" feel that many similar artists seem to have.  I can honestly say that I enjoy listening to every song except for one.<br /><br />Because of the subject matter (lots about cheating, doing wrong, etc.), I didn't feel that instant connection to the music that I felt w/Anthony Hamilton's CD (excellent btw!).  However, his beautifully earnest voice and delivery is definitely a winner.<br /><br />Wonderful CD, worth the money.
031286504X|5.0|Published in 1954, this book tells the sad, spooky tale of the last man on earth, Robert Neville.  For your own sake, do not read this book alone at night!  I have read Stephen King, watched George Romero and no one has scared the bajeezus out of me like Matheson can.
B000006IUQ|2.0|How unfortunate that this movie was released on DVD by one of only several studios that refused initially to accept the anamorphic format.    What this means, is that if you own a 16x9 television, you will not only have the black bars on the top and bottom, but on the sides as well.  If you use the ZOOM feature of your 16x9 tv, it fills the screen, but it pixilates and degrades the video terribly.  So you'll end up watching it in full letterbox hell.    Don't buy this, until they do the right thing and re-release it in anamorphic widescreen. After all, they DID release it in anamorphic widescreen in EUROPE.  [...]    Good viewing, everyone.
B0002X314C|5.0|This CD has to be supported and purchased. PLEASE DO NOT SETTLE FOR THE BOOTLEG COPY..HIS TALENT DESERVES MORE. This man's talent cannot be slept on! This is THE cd to have in your collection.  It is definitely a classic.  It is so refreshing to hear real music in this day and age.  I went and purchased it today (I had to support him) after hearing the bootleg over the last few months.  I love, love, love this entire CD from beginning to end.  No skipping songs on this one, how rare is that!  Mr. Legend is so extremely talented it is just incredible.  I cannot single out one track because they all move me in one way or the other, but I will say that SO HIGH touches my soul in a way that I cannot eloquently describe with words.  Thank you Mr. John Stephens (Legend) for helping me GET LIFTED and thank you Kanye West for bringing him to our ears. I hope and pray John Legend receives all the accolades his talent deserves.
B00005JN2Z|1.0|I was excited about watching this movie. Really like the cast members and had heard good reviews. The movie got worse and worse as it went on. Totally unrealistic and too coincidental. Jamie Foxx was the only thing that held it together at all. I could not wait for it to end..
0156027321|5.0|\\"Life of Pi\\" generated a lot of hype when it was first published and reviewed. Sometimes that can help a book enormously, because it ropes in readers who wouldn't normally be drawn to such a book. Sometimes it's bad because it ropes in readers who wouldn't normally be drawn to such a book.    For those not normally drawn to such material beware. The first half of \\"Pi\\" is not the easiest read. The cover is misleading, in that this is not a cutesy animal story.  Also, people drawn to this book looking for quick answers are going to be disappointed.    \\"Life of Pi\\" starts off with a few beautiful nuggets about Pi, a boy whose father owns a zoo in Pondicherry, India. Pi's father tries to teach his family a lesson by forcing them to watch a ravenous tiger, named Richard Parker, devour a live goat. The children coil in fear as the father reminds them that the animals around them are not their pets. It is to be an important lesson. Later Pi is amazed and captivated by all the beliefs that surround him in India, even atheism. Though he has a problem with agnostics. This slow build up sets the stage for the second half of the book where, after selling the zoo, Pi and his family sail to the Americas to begin a new life. The ship soon sinks along with several of the zoo animals, which had been sold to other zoos in Canada and the U.S. Pi survives by climbing into a life boat filled with animals, including Richard Parker.    What follows next is not a Disney like story, where the boy and tiger become fast friends. This is a story about impossible survival. This second half of the book moves with lightning speed as we see Pi forced to adapt and change in order to live.    I think that many who were drawn to this book felt that it would have some great and immediately change on their beliefs. That perhaps it would heighten their spiritually. The book even sells itself as \\"proof of God\\", but this is not what the author says..it's what a character says to the author in reference tothis story. It's those subtle and wonderful and confusing moments that make this book so rich. Is Richad Parker a tiger, a metaphor, or something much worst. We never get the real answer. In fact we are almost forced to make a leap of faith ourselves as to what really happened to Pi in that lifeboat. In retrospect, I can't think of a better analogy of faith.    One final note, buy 10 copies of this book and create a reading club. In my opinion, you'll get more out of this book with a group.
B00004TWSW|5.0|Yes it's true that Steve Hoffman did remaster this album for release on a DCC Gold Disc it was to be DCC GZS-1143, it was never released to the public since DCC went out of business. <br /> <br />Having the pleasure of owning all four Gold CD versions of the released Steve Hoffman/DCC masters (The Doors, Strange Days, Waiting for the Sun & LA Woman) I can only imagine the warmth in the music, the resolution & the sound quality that is missing from both of the Elektra CD releases. Possibly this remaster will be made available to us, but only time will tell. <br /> <br />On another note I would like to add that Bruce Botnick did great job of remastering all The Doors albums to 24bit/96khz. The Elektra HDCD releases of The Doors studio albums & In Concert at 20bit/44.1khz are in my opinion very well done. The HDCD Soft Parade album is much improved over anything else I have been able to listen to besides an original vinyl. <br /> <br />Note to Elektra, <br />Everyone would love to have all of the other studio albums on DVD-A not just LA Woman, you have remastered all of them at 24/96, forget the surround mix let us have it!!!! <br />
0449002632|4.0|At around 1000 pages, \\"London\\" looks intimidating. It doesn't get any less intimidating when you crack open the spine and realize that this is not just the story of London, but the story of several families and how they thrive, prosper, and fail over the course of 2000 years along the Thames. A family tree takes up a couple pages and to trace your finger along it makes the task of reading about all these characters seem daunting. However, once I began the first story, I was hooked.  <br /> <br />It is here that we are introduced to our first family, the Celtic Duckets (a trait ascribed to their webbed hands, also a neat literary trick to track the Ducket heirs). Soon we meet the Anglo-Saxon Barnikels and the Norman Silversleeves as well as a few other families. Each generation bringing new changes to London as well as to their perspective families. Together these families over the course of time  fight Caesar, build the Tower of London, create the British stock exchange, and save Shakespeare's career. They live on London Bridge and converse with Henry the VIII. Some even eventually seek their fortune in the Americas. Each chapter is a new time and a new tale.  Rutherfurd also has a talent for spinning witty, quick, and easy to digests historic yarns. <br /> <br />After so many pages and so many separate stories, I couldn't tell if I was running out of steam or maybe it was Rutherfurd. Either way I was grateful to close the cover on the book. It was great fun, but even fun has to end sometime.  <br />(4 and a half stars)
0440539811|5.0|As others have stated, this book isn't so much about enlightening oneself with the actual plot events in Illuminatus!... it's more a literary tool to help spark a change in the reader's own thought patterns.  The book itself is chaotic and hilarious.  If you take the subject matter seriously, that's up to you... but, I find that it's most enjoyable to take it all in good humor.  I personally love leaving this book out on my desk and to just read a chapter or two every now and then throughout the year.  (this is after reading it through twice).  The writing style(s) and wacky scenarios make for excellent daily reading passages... sort of like an extended FarSide calendar or something. <br /> <br />For me personally, I found the book in it's entirety to be somewhat of a liberating experience.... it helped me to remember not to take anything in life for granted... and to look at everything with fresh eyes as often as possible.  Life altering?  meh... not really.  Catalytic and inspirational?  most definitely.   <br /> <br />I still try to recommend this book to all... but, try not to focus so intently on the overall plot, character development, etc.... look more for your own reactions to what you are encountering.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|(Sound of fingers typing on keyboard CLICK..CLACK...CLICK) <br />I am amazed by the terrible transfer(SOUND OF MAN BREATHING IN) this impressive film has (SOUND OF MAN BREATHING OUT) received. At first i thought this dvd was <br />a winner; original japanese mix in 5.1, directors commentary. This is more than most foreign films offer on dvd.(SOUND OF MAN SHIFTING IN CHAIR) But oh the dissapointment when I played the movie. It plays english captions not english <br />subtitles. The very first scene in the film starts with the caption(HELLICOPTER APPROACHING). At first I figured it was my dvd player not the dvd, why would <br />they sell a dvd stricly for those fluent in Japanese and the english speaking hearing impaired. (SOUND OF RAPID TYPING) After about an hour of tampering with my dvd <br />player settings(MAN COUGHS) I realized that this dvd was in fact made to drive its viewer into a minor hysteria(MAN SCREAMS  WOOP WEEEEHAA). But the menu is pretty cool(BREAKING GLASS LOUD YELLING)
B00005JMJ4|4.0|It is a bit of a surprise to see people so polarized by the this movie.  It seems that it's an 'all or nothing' proposition.  For my part, I found that it was tasteful and restrained, but would have been much better had it not been cheapened by a few stereotypes and loose moments.  For example, it is ludicrous to think that a super-high end Tokyo hotel wouldn't have shower heads tall enough to suit Bob Harris.  And if someone wanted to really provide a call girl to someone in Tokyo on a $2 million dollar job, it would be at a much higher level than the unfortunate 'lip my stockings' lady.  You can get the best of everything in Tokyo.  As well, Charlotte's trip to Kyoto seems to be in the film for no other reason than to get Air's 'Alone in Kyoto' on the soundtrack.  <br /> <br />Making the connection between Tokyo and My Bloody Valentine is a brilliant stroke, though one might quibble with the song choices.  There is a scene with beautiful photography of Tokyo's lights from above, for which the soundtrack uses MBV's 'Sometimes'.  Maybe Kevin Shields wanted the vain pleasure of hearing his own voice, but 'Blown a Wish', 'To Here Knows When', or 'Loomer' (in that order) would be better choices.  The juxtaposition of Bilinda Butcher's dreamy voice layered over queasy arrangements of those songs are much more in line with the spirit of the movie than the gorgeous, leaden, dirge of 'Sometimes'.  Beautiful things layered on shaky foundations describe Bob and Charlotte's 'romance', and suit Tokyo, too. <br /> <br />The music choices are less serious when compared to the stereotype problems that mar the film.  Much like having found a hair in you food at a superior restaurant, one tends to remember the flaws more than the other lovely things that should be remembered.  This is a worthwhile movie, with certain cheap errors that leave you wondering how they could happen in something otherwise excellent.  Unfortunately, they are what I remember most.
B0006399FS|5.0|After listening to HTDAAB the first time I was so underwhelmed that I almost made the mistake of putting it in the Never-To-Be-Listened-To-Again pile.  But after all we've been through I figured I owed the boys at least another listening.  It was sometime during that second listening that something clicked and I realized that this is a pretty good album (CD?).  After the third listen I realized that this is among the band's finest acheivements.  If Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby are #1 and #1A, and War is just a hair below those two, then HTDAAB is just a hair below War and significantly better than ATYCLB.  Whereas I felt U2's prior release lost steam after the first six tracks, their latest album has not a single weak track.  It's a bit early to tell, but I think Miracle Drug may eventually be regarded as a classic U2 song (check back after listening #100). <br />Bottom Line:  1) Buy it.  2) Listen to it.  3) Listen to it again.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|This is the third DVD release of the Disney classic, and the studio's current technology has given us a print that probably looks better than it did in 1964 - not a scratch to be found anywhere.  The first DVD release presented a copy of the movie that showed little or no remastering at all, with a faded image and sound to boot.  Everything looked and sounded much better in the second release, the first to use 5.1 audio. But anyone watching the present DVD for the first time should appreciate all the work done during the immaculate restoration.  The image is incredibly sharp, bringing out even the smallest freckles on Julie Andrews' face.    Audio selections are varied on this new disc, including a French and a Spanish track, and three English tracks.  The sound is a marvel in 5.1 Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix - what a treat!  However, this \\"Mix\\", and the 2.0 version of the mix, sounds somewhat blurred when heard on TV speakers.  A good test is when the chorus enters during the main title sequence, singing \\"Chim Chim Cher-ee\\".  Normally, the chorus is up front and focused, but with the Enhanced Mix on TV they tend to be behind the already distanced orchestra.  For TV speakers only, viewers are encouraged to choose the Original 2.0 Theatrical Mix, which sharpens the sound considerably.    Extras are very fun and informative.    One of the best DVD's of the year.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|MAGNIFICENT TO BEHOLD, WITH SOME REALLY FINE ACTING TO BOOT, 'TROY', despite some really negative barbs from the usual boring critics, is a real epic spectacular!  wondrous to behold, breathtaking in it's vastness and scope, i along with a theatre full of people seemed extremely satisfied by mr. petersen's intrepretation (historians need not apply)! it really is awesome to see in all of it's screen wonders, some really fine performances, esp. mr. pitt, mr. bloom, and especially eric banas. it is also a joy to see the late peter o'toole and julie christie again. if you want 3 hours of eye popping visuals, some really splendid battle sequences, you will not go wrong with :TROY:.  we loved it and are eagerly awaiting the dvd release tuesday, 1/4!  it's an epic not to be missed.  happy new year to all.
B00005JLR8|5.0|I am baffled by some of the negative reviews of this movie and agree with those who have praised it. One negative review mentioned a line from one of the little girls near the end of the move as being a clunker. This line is delivered at a particularly tense moment as the family ponders a blood transfusion for their gravely ill newborn. The line is one of the most memorable film moments I have ever seen. It releases tension, reveals something the little girl has been holding inside for the whole movie and is one more example of the pitch-perfect nature of the film. Everything rings true emotionally. The script deals with powerful emotions, yet manages to be subtle in the details. I have seen this movie in the theater and on DVD. I watched the deleted scenes and I can see why they were deleted. Sheridan has always chosen the more subtle path. <br /> <br />I have never seen a better performance by child actors. There is a scene where the younger girl is flouncing around with a styrofoam cup on a stick in Central Park. She is pretending to be the Statue of Liberty. She is spouting a stream words about America and freedom. It is a small moment in the film but perfect. This was not in the script, the cameras just happened to catch her waiting to shoot a scene...being a little girl. The rest of the movie seems to be just that way--catching people being themselves.  <br /> <br />One can't help believing them. I don't like manipulative tear-jerking movies that just press your buttons. I love movies where people triumph over the things that life can throw your way. Having said that, I couldn't talk for about 15 minutes after walking out of the theater. My wife asked if I liked it and I could only nod and mumble. If feeling something scares you don't see this movie. If being touched by someone's story matters to you, own this movie! <br /> <br />I plan on watching this one regularly. I saw things in it the second time around that I didn't see the first.
B00005JMYI|5.0|oh the joy, the outrageous laughter, the sheer fun to be had over and over with will ferrell's latest smash hit comedy! it was made to order for him, as well as the rest of the cast. ms. applegate really holds her own here as straightman to will ferrell's anchorman. the pandemonium that occurs from here on is non stop hilarity-sometimes a bit vulgar and crude, but oh the sheer fun you will have if you let loose a bit. the entire theatre screamed with glee thru out, as i did again with my new dvd. get it and have a real ball new years eve-right in your own home.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Ever look around you and see zombies shambling about? Ever look in the mirror and see a zombie staring back at you? Well, SHAUN OF THE DEAD is for you! Other than OFFICE SPACE, I haven't seen many movies that capture our inhuman, workaday condition as well as this one does. Imagine going through the motions of life, year after dreadful year, until one day the world is inundated by zombie flesheaters. Now, imagine yourself not noticing the holocaust, due to your own zombie-like deadness! That's what the title character does, wandering through his daily rituals, oblivious to the carnage and chaos swirling around him! Shaun eventually wakes up after a \\"drunk\\" gal in his back yard turns out to be a re-animated corpse, hungry for Shaun's body mass! Together with his housemate, Ed, Shaun sets out on a mission to save his mum and ex-girlfriend from the cadaverous onslaught. Shaun must take control and use his wits for what appears to be the first time in his life. He must battle both the zombie horde and the idiocy of Ed! Can this simple nobody be the warrior / savior of his friends? Can he stand against the terror while everyone around him falls apart? This movie lampoons the zombie film, while skewering the routines we find ourselves in. It takes a normal guy like Shaun and tosses him into the shark tank of the unknown. It's also hysterically funny! I laughed from start to finish, even though there are some truly horrifying moments sprinkled in. The gore-factor is high, and the story is great. The best zombie parody since DEAD ALIVE! Highly recommended...
B00006AW2G|4.0|\\"Let It Bleed\\" demonstrates both the Roling Stones' greatest strengths and some of their most telling weaknesses; heralded since the day of its release as one of their finest--if not *very* finest--efforts, it pales in comparison to its mighty predecessor \\"Beggar's Banquet\\" and illustrates the difficulties the group had in trying to equal The Beatles' extraordinary consistency when it came to full-length albums.   <br /> <br />Most of the best cuts on \\"Let It Bleed\\" were indeed written and worked out during the latter half of the \\"Beggars\\" sessions, when Brian Jones was still an integral (if troublesome) presence in the group.  The epic \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" is no doubt one of the group's finest recordings, and when coupled with the epochal opening number \\"Gimme Shelter\\" recorded later(with some of the finest white vocals, male or female, on record), this seems to seal the album's reputation for many.  However, it is the seven tracks in-between which prove problematic. <br /> <br />The return to the blues presaged by \\"Beggar's Banquet\\" finds full flower here in \\"Live With Me\\", \\"Midnight Rambler\\" and \\"You Got The Silver\\", in spite of the anemic production.  Although the group does an admirable job of bringing \\"Midnight Rambler\\" to epic blues-jam heights, the live version released a year later trumps it tenfold and remains the definitive take.  Why they decided to include the jokey countrified version of \\"Honky Tonk Women\\" rather than the triumphant single version is beyond me, and the title track is a deliberate shambles (both in production and playing) which many critics point to as a reflection of the shattered dreams of the end of the decade, but which I simply find a turgid bore.   <br /> <br />The best tracks outside of \\"Gimme Shelter\\" and \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" remain \\"Live With Me\\" and \\"Monkey Man\\", two  <br />hard rockers that establish the core groove by which the Stones would continue to thrive for another decade or so.  Along with the admirable if rough take on \\"Midnight Rambler\\", this makes a little over half of the album reflect the classic heights which it has attained in the rock pantheon; although I expect major disagreement here, more consistent Stones albums remain \\"Beggar's Banquet\\", \\"Sticky Fingers\\", \\"Aftermath\\" and \\"Between The Buttons\\".  Much of the sound of \\"Let It Bleed\\" is too homogenized, and the transition from Brian Jones to Mick Taylor is too keenly felt; Taylor would make his full virtuosic presence felt only on the three followup efforts \\"Ya Ya's\\", \\"Sticky Fingers\\" and \\"Exile\\".
0767834739|2.0|Resident Evil: Apocalypse begins where the first film left off as Raccoon City has become a sweltering pot hole for T-virus infected zombies that seek human flesh to devour.  People seek refuge outside the city as the Umbrella Corporation, which is responsible for the mishap, has risen walls around the city in order to contain the virus within the city.  When it becomes apparent that the T-virus has reached the outer wall the Umbrella Corporation shuts down the passageway out as the remaining people within the city are left to fend for themselves.  One of these people, Alice (Milla Jovovich), has just awakened inside a hospital where she is attached to several different machines that monitored her health, and once again she has to fight for survival.<br /><br />The struggle for survival turns the film into a roller coaster journey that goes up and down, but unfortunately it seems to stay down most of the time as the action sequences become too cool, almost godlike, which removes any atmosphere of fear, or trepidation that Resident Evil should arise.  The true horror, which was an element in the first film, is wiped out as the film instead attempts to offers a cinematic experience through shoot 'em up action.  There are some interesting scenes such as Alice running down a wall, and the Nemesis attack on the S.T.A.R.S. station, which leaves one survivor.  But overall, Resident Evil: Apocalypse does not provide much fright or scare.  The action sequences, at times, feel awkward and more humorous than suspenseful as the characters are supposed to struggle for survival.  When some poor soul is about to die, it becomes slightly predictable as if some formula was concocted in order to save the film.<br /><br />The film does not overcome its negatives as in the end the film does fall flat, but there are some highlights in the story.  For example, the film has interesting cinematography, good lightning, and cool special effects.  These positives only make it bearable to view the film as the story seems to be hurried and unfinished.  Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a distilled cinematic version of the video game by Capcom, but the film does not move the near heights of the video game as the film is purely a trip to the shooting range, which leaves an empty feeling within.view the film as the story seems to be hurried and unfinished.

B00030590I|2.0|I was really excited to watch this movie.  I thought it was going to be some kind of masterpiece based on the reviews and word of mouth. <br /> <br />Wow, was I disapointed.  <br /> <br />A) Slow motion was used way to much. <br /> <br />B) The way the told the same story five (or however many) different ways just bored me to death. I almost fell asleep a few times while watching it. <br /> <br />C) A few of the early fight scenes were good.  Most of the others, again, relied too much on slow-mo! <br /> <br />D) Some of the large army scenes were too CGI'd for me.  You don't even have to look closely to see that the people are duplicated.   <br /> <br />E) Each time a character in the movie is stabbed, they show the victim's face and you hear the sword go in.  EVERY SINGLE TIME- How trite! <br /> <br />Comparing this to \\"Crouching Tiger\\" is a joke and I feel bad even mentioning them in the same breath. <br /> <br />I'd give it one star but I did enjoy the first half hour of the film.
0393035158|1.0|1. Mr. Harris states that the 911 attacks were inspired by pure religious belief inherent in Islam. Every Muslim scholar and intellectual will tell you that attacking civilians in warfare is absolutely forbidden. However, Islam does have the concept of jihad as a mechanism to forcefully remove oppression and restore justice when other means fail. Islam makes no apology for that. At the same time, Islam does not espouse the \\"Robin Hood\\" approach to justice: oppress the rich because they oppress the poor. Al-Qaeda  represents an extreme approach to jihad which has its adherents because Muslim governments have given up their duty to uphold justice. Instead these governments are busy serving their own needs and selling the West cheap oil <br /> <br />2. Mr. Harris observes violence committed in the name of religion and therefore concludes that we must abandon religion. Isn't this a childish response to an otherwise complex dynamic? His response is not unlike that of Marx when he concluded from the oppression of the Catholic Church that religion is the opiate of the masses. Should we not apply the same standards to other conflicts? More people have been killed in the name of atheistic and European philosophies. Hiroshima? Jewish Holocaust? Stalanism? Colonialism? <br /> <br />3. Harris' ideal is atheism and rationalism. But he is trying to remove the `human' from humanity. Humankind is the only species that yearns for the next world, and this yearning is built into our beings. It did not simply evolve for, as many thinkers have said, religion is not biologically efficient. Rather, as Muslims say, this yearning comes from God as a natural motivation for us to seek the truth. Mr. Harris, to me, pursues a line of thinking reminiscent of 19th Century materialists who wished to engineer social utopias of efficient and rational humans, but otherwise devoid of their humanity. Religion has been integral to human history; atheism was always an aberration. Atheism is inherently absurd because it cannot reconcile the dual worldly/spiritual nature of humankind.  <br />
B00005JMUL|5.0|I (47 yr old Mom) took my 6 yr old son and 9 yr old daughter to see this movie on Christmas Eve in the hopes of extending what seems to be my daughter's renewed belief if Santa this year.<br /><br />This movie beautifully reinforces the magic of the season and the importance of loving one another, even though we are all different. Santa speech at the end of the film is appropriate for believers and older children alike.<br /><br />This will undoubtedly be a Christmas Classic as time will tell. It has visual as well as emotional appeal for all ages. It is captivating, intelligent and fun REFRESHINGLY unlike today's dumbed down, rude or violent PG movies aimed at our young children. Parents will find nothing objectional in this film, which is a delight in itself.<br /><br />Go see it with your loved ones, and buy it when it comes out on DVD. I know I will.

B0002O06N0|5.0|The Black Keys came out strong two years back with their debut album The Big Come Up, but after following up the album one year later with a painfully average album I was not sure what would come of this band.  With their third album in just as many years though, the band picks up where they left off on their debut with their retro blues sound that could make Jack White jealous.  The album is from start to finish an amazing record that deserves major recognition.
B0006A9FKA|2.0|I'm a huge fan of zombie movies.  But for me, the combination of dry british humor and zombie horror just didn't work.  If you want to be grossed out and be rolling on the floor laughing at the same time, I would recommend any \\"The Evil Dead\\" trilogy, \\"Re-Animator\\", or Peter Jackson's \\"Dead Alive\\" rather than this movie.  I would not see it again.
0393035158|4.0|I'm delighted to have found this book. Finally, someone puts forward a cogent argument against the blind faith of religion, thereby supporting a reasoned view of the universe. So many of the world's problems can be traced directly to this insistence on faith without reason, as Harris shows in a series of chapters detailing different religions. Today, we think of Muslim and Christian Fundamentalism as the problem. As Harris shows, the problem goes much deeper. I recommend this book to all freethinkers and those interested in religion.

Brothels in Amsterdam:  again, they're not anything like they're dipicted in this movie.  The women sit dressed in lingerie in store front windows.  Plus, the Dutch are so polite and professional (even the prostitutes) that the entire situation dipicted in the film is totally absurd.    Soccer hooligans:  they typically start riots at Soccer games, not in pubs.  Even if you were to wander in to a pub that was frequented mostly by locals who didn't like outsiders, the worst thing that would happen is that you would just be ignored.    Yes, Eastern Europe is impoverished when compared to Western Europe, but the exchange rates aren't that good.  If they were, everyone would go there.    There are plenty of genuinely funny things about Europe, but alas, none of these things were depicted in this movie.  Maybe the writers should think about actually going there.

B0006B29Z2|5.0|I was 15 back in the summer of 81, when I first saw Maiden(July 23 1981 at NYC Palladium) during the Killers tour.I still miss Clive Burr's drumming.In my opinion,Maiden were heavier with Clive on drums.So all of you youngsters out there \\"JUST GET THE DVD\\".

B00006RINF|3.0|i bout this two days ago out of curiosity... i was slightly dissapointed, but i think it might grow on me, like most bands i currently love (i was unimpressed with most songs on my first tool cd.now i love them). christinas voice is beautiful, but does not seem to have much range. the lyrics could have been much better. when i listened to the cd while reading the lyrics i was reminded, not musically at all but lyrily, of linkin park, and (forgive me for the overused comparison) evenescence, in that they seemed to use the same words over and over in the corse of the album. for example, heart, guilt/shame, and i heard variations of the word lie many, many times...you get the idea. all the words where a little too abstarct for my tastes,(it seemes as if every other word was a quality of virtue). also, the males vocalist was very dissapointing. i was tempted to skip through entire songs because of it. his voice is neither melodic nor aggressive, and rather ruined the hypnotic mood set by christina. despit their experiance i feel that they are not reaching their full potntial and christinas voice espessially could be used to much greater benifit. however i will keep in mind that this is the first lucun coil album i have heard, and will continue to listen to it to see if it only needs to grow on me.  <br />     if you have taken the time to read this, i would like to appoligize for my bad spelling.
B00031TXBI|5.0|Words escape me to describe Inside of Emptiness.  Magnificent comes close.  Beautiful approaches the truth from another angle.  What it really is is genius.  Genius is such a dry, cliched word, but it is the truth.  I find tracks 1 through 5 are some of my favorite Frusciante songs ever.  Every time I try to narrow it down a little more than that, I am defeated.  And I think about this EVERY DAY, folks. <br /> <br />Yes, some may have been disappointed to learn that this is much less experimental than John's other work.  The rumors were true, but the fears were entirely unfounded.  I am a longtime fan of John Frusciante's solo work and own all of his CD's, and I am telling you that this is one of the best, if not his very best.  When I listen to IOE, it feels like the pleasure centers of my brain are directly being touched.  Get it today.
B000065V3H|1.0|Ditto on the widescreen issue.  Furthermore, I had to read a bunch of reviews b/c Amazon doesn't have the aspect ratio details.   <br />  A classic movie, deserving of a true original aspect ratio transfer to DVD.  If I want pan and scan, I'll rent the VHS thank you. <br />  I'm so sick of pan and scan DVDs.  They are honestly not worth the price of a Whopper with cheese.  3.5 star movie, 0 star DVD.   <br />  It makes you wonder who's in charge of creating these DVDs at the major studios...this is just pathetic.   <br />  Amazon also needs to clearly mark this DVD as 1.33:1 aspect ratio!!!
B000002572|5.0|ive listend to these guys since...as long as i can remember (not that long, as im 16 years old), but whenever i can, i borrow this cd from my dad. this is talent. for someone who likes metal, punk, ska, reggae, and is young, u might not expect me to like this, but i love all 70s music. this is some of the best 70s rock you can get. saw them live last summer, great preformance, should have played a bit more of these older songs though. played alot of the newer stuff, which is okay, but i would have just liked to hear all of this and the next album hahaha...but, when they tour again, see em, tom shultz is amazing, and all the replacment band memebers are also awesome.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Moore did with F 9/11 what CBS, ABC, FOX, CNN, BBC, NBC etc did not do, investigate the truth. <br />  The real point here is that the Bush Adm. never disputed one fact of this movie, not one.   <br />  This movie is not so much anti-Bush (it is) as much as it is anti-war.  Spoiler alert:  Moore sums it up best saying \\"our soldier's give us the greatest gift, their sacrifice in the line of duty, and all that they ask in return is that we don't send them to war carelessly.\\"   <br />  In light of the horrible death toll of up to 50,000 people this week from the tsunamis in Asia, I wonder if G. W. will start \\"a war on tsunamis.\\"  All of u who voted for W should be ashamed.  The continuing deaths of our braves soldiers is on your shoulders.   <br />
B000002J2D|3.0|There are many reviews here of this album, but I felt like I needed to say something of my own.  This album has its ups and downs but there are passages that really work. <br /> <br />\\"Down and Out\\": it is my belief that if this song had been on the previous album, people would love it.  I love it no matter where it is.  The intro is like a combination of \\"Watcher of the Skies\\" and \\"Dance on a Volcano\\".  There's a little more polish, but this song is one of their best ever.  It works.  And check out that keyboard and drum ending -- it's signature Genesis all over it. <br /> <br />\\"Undertow\\" and \\"Snowbound\\": these are 2 of the most emotional songs they ever did.  They harken back to that \\"Hairless Heart\\"/\\"Harlequin\\"/\\"After the Ordeal\\" emotion that this band used to do so well. <br /> <br />\\"Burning Rope\\": this song would not be worth much if it weren't for that glorious instrumental mid-section.  My goodness, that section is absolutely stunning.  It's nearly as perfect as Yes' 2 steel guitar ascensions on \\"And you and I\\".  Unfortunately, the rest of the song is rather unremarkable. <br /> <br />\\"Many Too Many\\" / \\"Follow you Follow Me\\": these are pop songs, but the world needs good pop songs like these.  Mike's crying guitar on \\"Many Too Many\\" is perfectly placed with Tony's ever-present synth backdrop.  As for \\"Follow\\", it's perfect.  I don't much care for it done live, but as it appears on this album, it's wonderful. <br /> <br />\\"The Lady Lies\\": this song works much better when it's done live.  Here, it's a little tired and way too subdued. <br /> <br />So, all in all, the album has its highlights but on a whole it's lacking umph.  But, for the highlights that I've covered, it's worth owning.
B0002Y69NG|1.0|The Matrix is excellent.  The Animatrix is excellent.  Reloaded and Revolution were awful.  This has to be the biggest rip off going right now.  The two sequels are basically awful movies and should never be watched by anyone.  This is hollywood dribble at its worst.  The only bigger ripoff is the Ultimate Limted collection which is well over 100 dollars.  They also went back and \\"remastered\\" the Matrix to make it look like the other two.  No reason for this.  Now it looks all washed out and grey like the last two.  I seriously almost walked out of the theater near the end of Reloaded I was so dissapointed.  <br />  The Matrix will stand the test of time.  Reloaded and Revolutions are easily forgettable.  Even die hard Matrix fans thought these two films were awful.  Revolutions is so full of itself I almost felt like I was sitting through Sunday school or something.  Buy the LOTR trilogy instead.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Yes, the elements are the same:  orphaned girl forced to endure the care of the 'Wicked Stepmonster.'  But, in this case, Cinderella, aka Danielle, can take care of herself.  She even manages to rescue Prince Henry from a band of Gypsies who plan to keep him hostage.  Her unlikely 'fairy godfather' is non other than DaVinci himself.  And the ending for her wicked Stepmonster and Sib couldn't be more appropriate.   <br /> <br />Yes, there was a happy ending, but as Danielle's great-great granddaughter says, \\"The important thing is that they lived.\\"  I agree with that!
B0006A9FMI|1.0|*************Because Amazon won't let me review the same product twice (even though the Blu-Ray disc is technically a different product) I have to update my earlier review for the DVD version************<br /><br />Like the region 1 DVD release for this film, the Blu-Ray release seems to be a rush job.  Once again the cover is uninspired and unrepresentative of what the film has to offer, but the main problem is the lack of high definition audio.  Instead of making the Blue-Ray release better and offer something above the DVD version, the only audio tracks available are Dolby 5.1 and stereo.  On top of that the extra features on the Blu-Ray are identical to the DVD version.  Go for the Japanese version, if you can stomach spending $80 on one movie.<br /><br />***********Below is the original review for the DVD, which I should point out that Dreamworks or whoever sent out replacment discs with corrected subtitles**********************************<br />First of all, this is an excellent film with amazing artwork that deserves at least a 4 star rating.  Unfortunately Dreamworks released the DVD and made it unwatchable.  I was immediately dissapointed by the cover artwork; it is plain and incredibly boring.  Also the disk does not have english dub, but I don't care about that.  What makes this disk receive 1 star is the fact that it has NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES, ONLY CAPTIONS.  So along with engilsh subtitles you get captions for the hearing impaired such as \\"footsteps\\" or \\"dog barking\\".  I had to turn the movie off after about 2 minutes of this.  I'm glad I was able to see this at the theater because I will not be watching this disk.
B000002TLX|5.0|I bought my copy of this album way back in the Fall of 2002 for two songs alone.  They were Hold On To The Nights and Right Here Waiting.  Believe it or not, I found nothing outstanding about any of the other songs.  THAT WAS THEN, THIS IS NOW! Then along came My Own Best Enemy which I literally fell in love with.  So I decided it was time to review the songs I had rejected more than 2 years ago. <br /> <br />And I came to this conclusion; two years ago I exercised very poor judgment indeed.  Richard cannot write a bad or boring song. Each selection is a perfect little jewel in itself. The rock songs as well as the ballads are a testament to his genuis as a writer.  And, boy, does that voice really grab you. Grit and sandpaper, overlaid with honey describes it for me.  <br /> <br />I am really glad that he included the beautiful Angel's Lullaby which he composed for his sons.  As far as I know, this song hasn't been on any of his 7 other CDs.  Anyhow, just wanted to let folks know about my experiences with this CD.  Don't dismiss it or you will have missed some really great music!
B0000AZAUM|4.0|I love how this album keeps coming back into my life. I heard it for the first time in college (the first go-around, with some friends in Santa Cruz) and now it's blasting out of the trailer for Wes Anderson's latest flick.  <br /> <br />Rest assured there is way more to this one than the ubiquitous 'Ziggy'. One can even forget about that God-awful Bauhaus cover or Bowie's forays into jungle and 'industrial'. Like one reviewer put it so well, it flows seamlessly from track to track. And that production! For stereo geeks, there is nothing else quite like it (OK, well maybe Lou Reed's 'Transformer' which is really just Bowie with Lou on top)...that freeze-dried sound: the drums that  pound like the inside of your head; the glam guitar that slides up your vertebrae like a tasty IPA from that pub 'ol Carrot Top is posed outside of on the cover....yeah yeah I could go on but I won't.
B000286S8S|5.0|Van halen is probably the best band with the greatest debut album ever! \\"its about time,\\" \\"Up for breakfast,\\" and \\"learning to see\\" those are the new songs they have made and they are killer! Although I disagree a lot with the three live tracks, because it's kinda redundent to have the live version and the studio version on the same album. There is only one other way to get these treasures in your cd wallet, and that is to buy every album from the 10x platinum & DIAMOND record Van Halen to the 3x platinum \\"Balance.\\" So, why not get the best of both worlds (no pun intended. Eddie, Alex, Mikey, Sammy, and of course David lee Roth will rock your world. FYI, the reason there are so many low reviews is becausepeople are either roth or hagar fans. Plus, people want to hear their favorites not greatest hits. theres a huge difference
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is really a great CD.  Before this album every Green Day song sounded the exact same.  The title Song American Idiot sounds like a classic Green Day song but eveything else is much different and I mean that in a good way.  Finally a group changes things up for the better!  Sometimes this formula backfires miserably but I won't mention any names (Beastie Boys). <br />
B0002X314C|5.0|The best CD I have heard in a long time.  It is uplifting, romantic, funny, and purely a joy to listen to!!!  I have waited for real music to listen to for the longest time.  I'm so sick of this overpolished, no talent, funky crap that everybody is putting out to get a number one song on the charts...but arent really concerned with creating music that will last nor make an impact on humankind for a lifetime and well after.  I love this CD!!!!!!  Its really a shame how everyone makes a fuss about people like talentless Usher and John Legend will probably not even get half of that exposure when he so deserves it.  He is an amazing talent!!!  Cop the CD Leagally!  Support the brutha.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I saw this movie days before getting on a plane to the West Coast leaving my lover and job behind. I was fleeing from painful memories I was certain I could not handle. The movie stayed with me. I got back on a plane back home and asked for my old position back and made up with my lover. Two months later I am sure it was the best decision I ever made. Oprah should do a show on how this movie has effected so many lives. From reading these reviews it really seems like it has.
B0001IN0DA|5.0|I just got this DVD because I got $100 for Christmas. I was expecting this wrestlemania to be the best wrestlewmania ever but it didn't meet my expectations. <br /> <br />My expectations were <br />1. Hyped up crowd. <br />2. Goldberg vs Lesnar and Undertaker vs Kane to be two of the greatest matches. <br />3. Better Extra Features. <br /> <br />But now that I think about it, my expectations were a bit too high. The crowd were fairly hyped up at first but later, after sitting through many hours of matches,they had to be tired. Goldberg vs Brock and Undertaker vs Kane was too good of a match to begin with. Lastly, That was enough extra features to keep most of the wrestling fans to be entertained.  <br /> <br />1. John Cena vs Big Show for the US Championship <br />Very god match. Gets the crowd hyped up and nice FU(I think that's what it is tho I'm not sure) by John Cena. <br />8.5/10 <br /> <br />2. Chris Jerico vs Christian for Trish? <br />Decent match. Good acting but so so match. Unexpected ending. <br />7/10 <br /> <br />3. Four Way Tag team match for World Tag team championship <br />Fairly entertaining match. Nothing special. <br />7.5/10 <br /> <br />4. Rock N sock connection vs The Evolution <br />5 star match but I was expecting Rock N sock to win. Batista supposed to dominate but the Rock kills him with his moves.(just look at the size. Rock is about 270 lbs, 6'5\\" but Batista looks a lot bigger than rock) <br />8.5/10 <br /> <br />5. Inter Promotional Playboy Evening Gown match  <br />The best match ever! maybe for sickos. sure, they are hot but it wasn't a good match. <br />6.5/10 for Torrie Wilson and Stacy. <br /> <br />6. Cruiserweight Elimination match for Cruiserweight championship <br />Great match. Very fast paced and high flying match and it would've been better if the crowd was more into it. Gay ending though. Where did that Guerrero Sr. come out of? Go back to selling enchiladas you retard!!! <br />9/10 <br />  <br />7. Brock Lesnar vs Goldberg  <br />The match I got the DVD for but was freaking retarded and slow paced. Goldberg finishes him off so easy but in reality Brock can kick his butt. (but I'm Goldberg fan) And horrible start. i guess it had fairly good ending. Stone Cold kills both of them even though Stone cold is like 45 now. (I'm also Stone Cold fan and Stone cold best badass ever but gotta admit the truth) <br />5.5/10 <br /> <br />8. Four Way tag team match for WWE tag team championship Not as good as Raw tag team match but it was better than goldberg vs lesnar.  <br />7/10 <br /> <br />9. Victoria vs Molly holly <br />It was actually worse than Goldberg vs Lesnar maybe not. Because Molly gets her hair shaved. HAHAHAHA and Kurt Angle even get to see her hair get shaved live!!!!! Should've been on Raw or something. Even would have been a starter match for RAW. <br />5/10 for hair shaved <br /> <br />10. Eddie Guerrero vs Kurt Angle For WWE championship <br />Even though Kurt Angle is right, to lie, cheat, and steal is better!!! Great performance. lots of grapples and amateur style wrestling. Expected ending though. <br />9/10 <br /> <br />11. Undertaker vs Kane (Undertaker's return) <br />The whole buried alive was so stupid but WWE has been doing that since 1990 or something.(besides everyone knows its fake but its still entertaining caus its funny as heck and the Torrie Wilson dad dying was also funny but don't know if it's real or not. owen Hart was real. RIP Owen Hart.) Ok match and great entrance. Was expecting the 1996 entrance music. Expected ending. <br />7/10 <br /> <br />12. Triple H vs HBK vs Chris Benoit for World Heavyweight Championship <br />Great match. Best match of the night. Brutal match but crowd was horrible in supporting the wrestlers. Great match though. <br />10/10 (would've been 100/10 if the crowd was into it)Also an Expected ending. <br /> <br />Overall, the Wrestlemania was pretty good but not the best. I would have to say the best was Wrestlemania 18 where it wasHulk vs The Rock and Triple H's return. bonus was just so so. <br />overall 8.5/10 <br /> <br />
B0002X314C|5.0|I have to say that I am very pleased with this album.  This CD is so good that u have find yourself playing one track after another.  The beats are the illest.  It first hits u with the prelude (this cat just gives u a taste of his talent at the first part of the album)  There aern't any favorite tracks that I like because every one is tight.  If I had to pick it would be Let's get lifted, Number one, Used to love u, ordinary people, lifted again, Live it up, and I can change.  When an album comes out and the whole household listens to it (eventhough they favor different types of music) then that means that this is a must have CD.  So go out and Cop this CD. $7.99 @ Circuit City.
B000006TRV|5.0|This review is not like others explaining how Pink Floyd is the greatest and all others must kneel before them (though they are my favorite band). Instead I bring up a point often overlooked in concern with the Wall. Many \\"fans\\" claim this album is decent, with only a few good songs and lots of filler, the problem is that that's not filler. The Wall, like many Floyd albums, is a concept album. the entire album tells a story, the story of an isolated, sad dejected boy who grows up to be a rock star, lives fast takes drugs (comfortably numb) and loses his wife (one of my turns, don't leave me now) and bulids a wall around himself to keep from being hurt or feeling emotions (hence the name, THE WALL) so, while many songs sound like filler try listening to the whole album at once and see if you can understand the subplot. or hey, if you really want to go see the movie they made about it ( aptly tiltled The Wall)
B000001FS3|5.0|In November 1987, my roommate and I made our way from the Rocky Mountains to the San Francisco Bay Area and, more specifically, the Oakland Colliseum to see U2, The Pretenders, and the BoDeans. It was an incredible weekend. Bono spray painted on the fountain at Embarcadero, and the Bay Bridge traffic came to a stop at lunch as people jammed the roads trying to get there. A friend slept in line and so we were at the front wall throughout the concert. It was one of those rare occasions where they let you in with cameras, too, so I have some great shots. W also got to play Uno with Bill Graham who was riding around on his golf cart, and hung out for a bit.<br /><br />This is one of the most memorable albums of all time. Huge singles, and a beauty and richness around the theme of America that ingrained U2 as a household name, and made this album a part of all of us. This is about as close to a perfect album as you can get.
B0002IU988|5.0|Alter bridge is an awsome band. The guitar riffs and solos are a pleasure to listen to as well as the singer. Ithought Creed sucked ever since Human Clay.Don't compare these two bands these Guy's are far superior.If you like some good hard rock Alter Bridge can deliver
0385507755|5.0|Although it was incredibly difficult to get through James Frey's vivid descriptions of his experiences before and during rehab, I couldn't put this book down.  It helped me understand the thoughts, feelings, and experiences of my family member who is an addict and who has been in an in-patient rehab center in a way that I never thought would be possible. It also helped me understand how those in rehab can perceive and react to loving family members who want to visit, help, and make things better.  I'm sure that family members of addicts and addicts will not be the only ones to appreciate this great book.  Book clubs and the general reader will also love this book because it is so well-written, creatively formatted to match the tone, brutal in its honesty, and written by someone with incredible strength of character.  <br /> <br />Sheryl Gurrentz, Author <br />\\"If Your Child is Bipolar\\" <br />\\"The Guilt Free Guide to Your New Life as a Mom\\"
B000002ADT|5.0|\\"Kind of Blue\\" is a must have for any serious jazz collection.  It features some of the greatest musicians in jazz history playing minimalist, yet wonderfully evocative, compostions which leads them to create perfectly constructed solos.  Every note on this recording is a gem!
B000099T2L|3.0|I was so IN LOVE with the tracks that was released as singles.  That means \\"Crazy in love\\" and \\"Baby boy\\". After that I got the album. And the dissapointment was rather huge acctually even though I find B the best singer in Destiny's Child, it certainly wasn't enough. Most of these songs are - believe it or not - in slow motion. I had expected the tracks to contain more power and a feeling of wanna move to the rhythms. I can tell you; you cannot \\"loosen up\\" in \\"Me, myself and I\\". And not with \\"That's how you like it\\" either. Or \\"Gift from Vergo\\" or... Well you get my point, right? Ok, she sings really REALLY good and all that, but there must be something more!  <br />For examples I just hate the featuring with Missy Elliot, \\"Signs\\", and have the biggest distaste to \\"Yes\\". Why dedicate a whole song to star signs?  <br />Although the tracks I DO like are the first 3 ones on the cd. And \\"Daddy\\", which is a hidden track, is a good one too... I just don't feel that the album is written with feeling. Most of the tracks are boring since they all sound so similiar with each other and have sex in some undercover tone in one way or another in each song. <br />I just hope that if she makes another solo album, it'd better be better than this! <br />
B00005JLT5|3.0|Let me begin by saying that \\"The Pianist\\" is a well-acted and superbly directed film. One can immediately sense that Polanski put his heart and soul into the project (for obvious reasons, given his own life story), and this effort brought the best out of everyone involved with the film. I would echo many others who have expressed their admiration of this film as a work of art.<br /><br />However, here is where I have an issue with this project: I am not sure that this story is worthy of such an effort. We are in no short supply of Holocaust-themed cinema, some of which rises to the level of masterpiece. Films like \\"Sunshine\\", \\"Europa, Europa\\", and the incomparable \\"Schindler's List\\" are not only visually stunning, but convey powerful life-affirming messages. Not the least of these is the idea that one must work pro-actively for one's bodily salvation. In \\"The Pianist\\", instead, we are shown a man whose does little to help himself survive. Instead, he is aided by a few sympathetic Poles, and a rather out-of-character Wehrmacht officer. The hero's complete passivity is almost incomprehensible. Is it worth all of Polanski's artistic efforts to glorify? I doubt it.

B0000024JN|5.0|Way before Eminem was catching trouble with Ja Rule, this 3-man white boys from the depth of New York's Lower East Side were making it possible for ol' folks of a lighter shade to grab the mic. Though Licenced to Ill was listed in hip-hop's boom bap peculiar smug sensibility that proved popular with Middle America. <br />The Beastie Boys showed the world that they could play with hip-hop in new ways. Their deliciously twisted Paul Revere was cleverly narrated by the Beastie Boys and the tunes for Hold It Now, Hit It and Brass Monkey seemed irregular and anarchaic. The album was a masterpiece, birthing classic cuts such as the burly (You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party), which remains as one of the ultimate rap party anthems 'til this very day. White men may not be able to jump but this 3-man group destroyed the premise that Caucasians couldn't be slamming on the microphone. <br /> <br />Best moments= (You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party), No Sleep Till Brooklyn, Paul Revere, Hold it Now, Hit It, Brass Monkey and Slow and Low
B000002H97|3.0|Music is music. That is all there is to it. It is also a theory, which means that many different people will respond in different ways to different kinds of music. I read these reviews of the Black Album done by people who, in my own opinion, are viewing this album outside of the realm of metal, or perhaps they are new to the genre, or maybe just old like me. I know that this reads like it's going nowhere, but bear with me. All of the tracks on the Black Album are solid, well written songs. That is from the perspective of the music lover. However, the metalhead in me has to agree with all of my other brothers and sisters of the Steel Faith, and say that it is not true metal. This album has all of the production qualities of a band that was looking to do one of two things, they either no longer wanted to push the envelope (what metal is all about), or they were simply selling out to reach a broader audience. I know that most of those who are outside of the true metal scene (if you listen to nu-metal exclusively then you are!) always stick their noses in the air when someone says that Metallica sold out. Therefore, I will simply state that they changed for a different audience. I mean, a family member of mine who always argued with me over the validity of metal started listening to Metallica shortly after the release of Load (wouldn't listen to the old stuff mind you, just the new songs). I think that most people who eventually began listening to Metallica as a result of their sound change never really gave any of Metallica's older tunes a chance. That's why I think it is garbage when Lars makes some crap statement on an awards show thanking the fans for helping the world know what Metallica was all about. Most of us \\"fans\\" were not requesting the new stuff for radio play. These people who put Metallica's new music on the top of the charts were not old fans, but rather new listeners, who as stated above would not give two hoots for the older music (Kill 'Em All, RideThe Lightning, etc.) Metallica's change also did nothing for the bands struggling to still play what they love, many playing the sound that Metallica helped pioneer, but because of their \\"change\\", these bands will probably never have a chance in the states. Anyway, I digress from my rant. Like what you want, listen to what you like. Just understand why many of us metalheads are dissapointed, and still dissapointed to this day with Metallica. [...]
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Michael Mann's 'Collateral' is one of my favourite films of 2004, along with Kill Bill' Vol 2. It's a sleek, smart thriller, and doesn't pretend to be anything more. It accomplishes what it sets out to do magnificantly. The acting, writing, and directing are all excellent. Jamie Foxx shows his considerable talent as an actor, and Tom Cruise is solid in a role you wouldn't expect from him.<br />All-in-all, there is no reason you shouldn't enjoy watching this movie.
1591840562|5.0|If you are interested in starting your own business, or just curious to find out what the best way to go about that is, I would definitely recommend reading Guy Kawasaki's latest book - \\"The Art of the Start\\". It is very easy to read, written in an entertaining yet very information-packed format. Mr. Kawasaki is a true expert in this field and he shares many of his personal stories in the book that will be very helpful to those struggling with the myriad of issues that face those trying to start a company.  <br /> <br />I heard of this book and thought it sounded interesting, but when my husband decided to launch his own business recently, it moved to the front of my mind. He and I have both read this and both of us have come away with some wonderful insights and ideas. It not only informs but inspires, and really lights a fire under those of us that are ready to march forth and conquer! <br /> <br />This is definitely worth the money and would be a great addition to anyone's business library! Just pick it up and skim it and I'm sure you will see why!!
0440178002|5.0|Shogun is my favorite novel of all time, the greatest novel there could ever be, and one of the most brilliant works of art and one of the greatest literary masterpieces in world history. I have read some of Charles Dickens' masterworks such as Great Expectations and Oliver Twist, and Shogun compares quite favorably to those, and is of similar quality to another of my favorite authors, Alexandre Dumas, of The Three Musketeers series fame (Dumas' The Three Musketeers series actually includes more than seven different novels, including The Man In the Iron Mask, 20 Years Later, The Black Tulip, The Vicomte de Bragelonne, Louise de la Valliere, etc.), but Shogun also stands apart as the one consummate and all-perfect Western portrait of Japan which no other Western writer has ever come close to matching. Let me just say this: For any American or Westerner who has any affinity for or admiration of Japanese culture, this book is an *absolute* necessity to read. Clavell captures not only Japanese customs, history, and social structure, but the very essence of Japanese aethetics, spirituality and the Japanese outlook itself. What unfolds is an historical novel of such excitement, passion, love, beauty, grandeur, violence, tragedy, and inspiration, that our present world of the 20th and 21st centuries melts away and is replaced by a pristine and flawless rendition of the chrysanthemum world of 1600, a time when edens still existed on Earth and great civilizations and countries like that of Japan were still unspoiled by the West. In Shogun pleasure houses are exalted as a gift of the gods rather than how brothels are debased as a \\"sin\\" in the West. An afternoon tea is elevated to the most refined, civilized, and sophisticated level imaginable, compared to the relative mediocrity of what an afternoon tea is in a country like England, where tea time is supposed to be a national tradition. For all of you under any other impression, the character of John Blackthorne is completely accurate from actual history. I did research after I read Shogun as a boy, and read distinct accounts in several library references about the almost-mythical Englishman who landed on the shores of Japan. But he did exist, and there are even books devoted exclusively to his history. He also is probably recorded in the Japanese municipal halls of records, and I'm sure research has been done on these. But as for the novel, Clavell has created an unforgettable story which will remain in your heart forever. And for people who do not understand the Japanese mind and spirit, there is no better thing to read than this book, which explains not only the Japanese attitude about politics, war, spirituality, self-discipline, duty, Japanese \\"love\\", and Japanese outlook, but also even the Japanese view of sexuality and business and strategy and family relations and philosophy. This book is so all-encompassing, it's hard to even do it justice with a review. Suffice it to say that it is by far one of the best novels EVER written, it deserves to be worshipped as an immortal masterpiece, and it is cherished by me as a unique and priceless treasure which changed me forever after I read it.accurate from actual history.

038572179X|1.0|An earlier review gave Atonement a five-star recommendation even after acknowledging that it was \\"horribly boring for the first 330 pages.\\"  The alleged saving grace was the book's \\"shocking\\" ending.  Sorry, but if a novel is only entertaining in hindsight, it's not really entertaining at all. The art of telling a story with a twist ending is to ensure that the story itself is compelling -- separate and apart from its ending.  McEwan utterly fails in that regard.  The characters are dull.  The prose is long-winded and tedious.  There's not one whit of wit anywhere in the story.  And the only satisfying aspect of the aforementioned ending is that it finally puts an end to the tedium that precedes it.  Ian McEwan will have to do much better next time to atone for Atonement.
B000089CJI|5.0|just bought this on hearing the previews. Awesome. Parts Pet Shop Boys, Air, Album Leaf and God knows who else.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|This album debuted and peaked at no. 2 on the Billboard charts. It's already sold 3 million in less than 2 months. These hits are culled from her 3 diamond certified albums. All the big hits are here and added bonus for her fans are two versions of  the fun song 'Party for Two' where she sings duets with Mark McGrath and Billy Currington. Another highlight is 'Don't', a very nice ballad. She winds up the almost 80 minute package with the purely country sound of 'I ain't no quitter'. If you're a new Shania fan, this is a good start.
B00003CXCT|4.0|After reading many of the 1700+ reviews of these DVDs I felt compelled to write one myself(my first review on Aamazon).  How can I, the ultimate Star Wars fan give the Trilogy 4 stars out of 5?  Simple, Return of the Jedi,Return of the Jedi, Return of the Jedi.  Sure, they are Lucas' movies and he can change stuff if he wants.  But why the hell did he put in that stupid ass scene in Jabba's palace?  The goofball thing singing that annoying \\"song\\" and the crappy editing accompying it...come on man!  You may as well have put Jar Jar in there too dude.  I grew up with these movies and love the picture and sound quality, but some of the changes are irrelevant and his supposed \\"reasons\\" for making them do not make sense.  The Jabba scene in EP IV, Greedo shooting first, the Emperor telling Vadar to \\"search his feelings\\" in ESB (what feelings, he's a sith), the ROTJ ending....it adds nothing to the story and in some cases just pisses the viewer off.  I could go on, but why, he is almost done making a fool of himself, and hopefully EP III will be good, but man that scene in ROTJ is so lame...... <br /> <br />I will always love Star Wars though, not even Lucas' ego can take that away.  So I guess after all of that, if you love these movies then buy the DVD's and take a deep breath before watching ROTJ. <br /> <br />May the force be with.
B000002JS6|5.0|This album is tied in with two of my personal favourite AC/DC albums; this one & 'Highway To Hell', I just can't pick (damn, I have too many albums!). But for the record this easily deserves 5-stars because it kick's ass! If any Limp Bizkrap or Linkin Pork fans think this is \\"whacked out eighties poser rock\\" then don't forget, that if it wasn't for these guys and countless other legendary heavy metal acts, those bands you nimrods seem to love so much wouldn't even BE around! So you know right there and then this is a great album! <br /> <br />After all, like this record suggests 'Rock 'n Roll aint Noise Pollution', so go and enjoy it! 'What do you do for money honey' (cool song name, huh?) is in my opinion, the most humurous track on the album. But 'Hells Bells' & the album title song are the two most best songs on the entire recording! <br /> <br />No rock/metal fan should be without this!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|First thought: A Space \\"What?\\"!   <br />Second thought: Oh...  Wow... Ooh!  NO!!!  OUCH!! Awww!!  Yay! <br />Third thought:  Fox cancelled this show WHY?? <br />Fourth thought: Oh thank GOODNESS! There's going to be a movie!!! <br /> <br />Having never heard of this show before I opened the box set for Christmas, the only thing I can say is \\"Thanks, Mom!\\"  After watching 14 episodes in 3 days, all the special features (except the hidden one!), I am so hooked, I'm already going into withdrawl.  The only thing keeping me from curling up in a fetal position is the promise of the movie \\"Serenity\\" in September 2005 (Serenity is the name of the Firefly-class space ship the show is based around).  I can tell you what everyone else has said: The actors are great, the writing is great, the show is great, but what I'd like to add is that the FILMING and the MUSIC are STUNNING! <br />Zooms.  Overshots.  Actors half in frame.  Focus adjustments!  Who's put focus adjustments in a TV show in the last decade?!  It's great!  It really does make you feel like you're THERE, watching the action and eating the dust left behind!  And the music?  The music isn't just in the background.  It sets the stage.  It quietly and subtly pushes your emotions along with the plot.  You can't help but feel what the crew's feeling! <br /> <br />But back to thought #1:  Space Western?  Definately!  No aliens, no \\"Anomolies,\\" just classic plots.  A train robbery!  Saloon fist-fights!  Travelling circuses with proof of \\"Alien life\\" that's just as realistic as we have today(a.k.a fake)! The \\"Frontier\\" is still out there, it's just moved out a few lightyears.   <br /> <br />A note for families with small children: <br />  BUY THIS!  Unless your children speak Mandarin, you don't have to worry about any cursing!!  Any expletives were written in Chinese, so no need for sensorship.   <br /> <br />Definately enjoy!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|'Vol.3' is to put it in a word: AMAZING. Okay, for all the people who know me know that I love metal, and to me I think Slipknot are a good band! Some of you might HATE me for saying that, but I don't think there's anything wrong with listening to the 'Knot, they're quite interesting to talk about too, go on admit it, when have any of you mentioned the name 'Slipknot' and it DIDN'T lead to a long conversation/argument?  Thought so. I mean I love Black Sabbath, Pantera (R.I.P Dimebag Bro!), Anthrax, Machine Head, Judas Priest, Metallica, Megadeth, Iron Maiden etc. but Slipknot always seem to be just as good as them (any one who says they're better than the bands I just named I try to stay away from, of course!). That might be an overstatement to say the least!  But if this is gonna cause a debate in the future, then I'll consider Slipknot as my guilty pleasure!  The best tracks are: 'The Blister Exists', 'Opium Of The People', 'Vermilion', 'Pulse Of The Maggots', & 'The Nameless'.  Corey Taylor (frontman) has really improved towards his vocal ability to both scream AND sing! Joey brings out his best drumming on a lot of tracks.  And there are solo's too! Awesome! Okay, fair point they're not as good as Slayer or Machine Head solo's OR riffs, but what would you expect!    I don't care what anyone says, this album is simply GREAT! Totally worth the money! All the best to the Slipknot boy's!
0553573403|5.0|George R.R. Martin in A Game of Thrones creates an astonishing array of characters and plots to keep the reader enthralled throughout and in anticipation of the next in the series. It will definitely stay on my top shelf for many years to come and, I'm guessing, so will the others that follow A Game of Thrones.<br /><br />Ned, or Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell, is the ruler of the north in the Seven Kingdoms and one of the major players throughout A Game of Thrones. He is married to Lady Catelyn, another major character, and together they have five children, Robb, Sansa, Bran, Arya and Rickon. He also has a sixth child, Jon Snow, who is Ned's illegitamate son. Ned helped defeat the previous king of the Seven Kingdoms with Robert of Baratheon, who know sits on the throne and is married to Cersei Lannister. In a Game of Thrones, the Lannisters are constantly looking for a way to gain more power and wealth, although you will have to read the book to see what they do and how they do it.<br /><br />The plot begins to take shape when Ned hears of the sudden and suspicious death of Lord Jon Arryn who was the Hand of the King, the second in command of the Seven Kingdoms. It's after Jon Arryn's death that Robert offers the position to Ned, and thus begins Ned's journey through exultations and tribulations in A Game of Thrones.<br /><br />Jon Snow has dreams of grandeur and adventure when he decides to help defend the Seven Kingdoms from northern invaders. Over the years, the Seven Kingdoms have built a huge wall for protection, although the numbers of men defending the wall have steadily decreased. Yet, it is the suspicious disappearances of those men that have people worried.<br /><br />I could continue on for days writing about the numerous characters that you will come to know and the numerous plot lines and twists throughout the book, but I'd rather not and let you find out for yourself.<br /><br />There were two things that I didn't much care for in this book, but they were not enough to bump it down a full star. Firstly, A Game of Thrones mainly contains swords, and very little sorcery until the end. It's not a big problem, just one to note. And secondly, with all of the characters and plots George R.R. Martin throws into this book, it makes it a little frustrating. The problem is this: I find myself enjoying one character and the storyline at that moment, but once the chapter ends, the reader is given another character, with another storyline, and has to wait a few chapters before the rest of that one character's story is told. The one sustaining factor with this problem is that I enjoyed reading about every character, even though their story was split up.<br /><br />George R.R. Martin has created a behemoth of a series with this first book, and I look forward to reading about how it all plays out., but they were not enough to bump it down a full star.

B000001FKY|5.0|To be totally honest, when I was a kid, I really wasn't into pop-metal at all! In fact, I think I hated it! But when I was given this album as a present for xmas years ago, 'Hysteria' never left my personal stereo, for about a year! Although to this day I still have a little trouble liking the pop-metal genre, Bon Jovi still gets on my nerves, and don't get me started on The Rasmus! But this was the type of music I had been searching for my whole childhood life, 'Women', 'Rocket', 'Animal' (favourite track), & 'Riot Act' are still played throughout my walkman today! <br /> <br />If you like this, then get some Van Halen, Aerosmith, KISS, Skid Row, Queen, but avoid anything from Bon Jovi, The Rasmus, & Europe (far too corny!).
B00005JNBQ|5.0|If you didn't like this movie you guys are f***ed. In my opinion it is the best of all time and if you disagree then you obviously didn't understand it. This movie is not for everyone but anyone who I've seen it with has thought it was hilarious. If you are over the age of 30, rent it to see if you like it first. But anyone else, indulge yourself!!! Jon Heder is an artist.
B00005QDW5|3.0|'Best of's...' really are just marketing excerises, and in truth there are just some bands that can't exactly have a 'best of'. So why Pink Floyd? Only because they're one of the greatest bands of all-time! But even in this sweet 2CD package, this compilation hits can only go so far. It might be pleasing to some, and to be honest I love most of it. <br />But just like I said, there are some who just can't have something like a 'greatest hits', because there are too many 'hits' to mention all at once! <br />If you're a big fan like myself, then just get 'Dark Side Of The Moon' or 'The Wall' instead. <br /> <br />Somewhat excellent (because it's Floyd), but flawed.
B00005JMUL|5.0|This is truly one of the best movies for the Christmas time that I have ever watched.  I would see this movie over and over again.  It not only captures the imagination of the young, but the young at heart.  I will be waiting to get this one on DVD, that our family can watch this over and over.  Highly recommend this one for all ages, it is a must see!!
B00006FDCD|1.0|how can stephen king stand to have his name even attached to this? I just finished the novel It last night for the first time, and it was one of the greatest books i've ever read. The movie, on the other hand, just sucks.A LOT of scenes are just made up and thrown in. Many of the scenes that made the book creepy were left out, and the ones that were put in were just plain lazy and rushed. The movie just completely failed at portreying derry as the small town inhuman evil that the book does. they don't explain the two forces of good and evil in the universe (it, and the great turtle) the deadlights showdown was completely slaughtered, none of the murders are shown or described at ALL( the vulgerness of this is one of the things that made the book so creepy) several things about the characters are just thrown in there without explanation, as if the writers were just assuming everyone read the book and knew all the characters(if i hadn't read the book, i wouldn't know what the hell was going on somtimes), a lot of the acting is horrible, the love and bonding and strenght of the losers club is not really as great as the book.i guess i should have expected this because movies are never as great as the books they are based on, but this was just plain lazy. the movie IT left me with the notion that the directors and actors didn't even read the book, or just rushed through it and failed to appreciate it's true greatness.
B0000AM6JI|5.0|When I rented this DVD I hadn't realized that I had seen it in a theater when it was first released in 1993.  I remember that I liked it then.  And, guess what?  I like it even more now.<br /><br />Directed by Brian DePalma and adapted from two novels by Edwin Torres, who just happens to be a judge in the New York Supreme Court, the screenwriter, David Keopp, did a wonderful job of bringing this story to the screen.  Yes, it's fictional.  But it has all the gritty realism of authenticity.  And it also has some wonderful actors.<br /><br />Al Pacino stars as Carlito, a Puerto Rican gangster.  When we first meet him, he's just been released from prison because of a technicality. He wants to go straight now.  Keep out of trouble.  But it seems impossible.  He's immediately drawn into to some heavy gunfights when his nephew gets involved in some drug sales. It's bloodshed and murder and a very exciting scene.<br /><br />Sean Penn is cast as his lawyer.  He's a sleazy type.  He's flashy, he's obnoxious and he's addicted to cocaine.  And Carlito also owes him a favor, a big favor.<br /><br />Carlito really tries to go straight, and even re-ignites a flame with his old girlfriend.  He's working as a manager of a nightclub and saving his money.  Supposedly, if he can get together $70,000, he'd be able to move to a Caribbean Island and run a car dealership.  That's his dream.  And I found myself wishing it would happen.<br /><br />Naturally there are complications.  The mob is involved.  And so is the lawyer.  And Carlito is drawn into another crime, this one with dire consequences.  The ending is inevitable.<br /><br />The film moved fast, the story was tight and well constructed, and I felt real emotion for Carlito and the hard choices he had to make.  The story was set in the 1970s and I loved the soundtrack of all the old music too.<br /><br />As an added bonus, there was a wonderful special on the DVD about the making of the film.  There are interviews with the judge who wrote the novel and he talks about it being based on his own experiences growing up Puerto Rican in New York.  We also hear from the screenwriter and the stars themselves.  All this really added to my enjoyment of the film.ased on his own experiences growing up Puerto Rican in New York.

B0000584V3|5.0|This is my favorite Opeth album.  I love everything about it.  I can't really add anything new to what's already been said other than the fact that Mikael Akerfeldt is one of my favorite songwriters.
B0006399FS|5.0|This CD just isn't as bad as people say... <br /> <br />Like many others, I read a lot of bad things about this CD and decided not to buy it.  Plus, the samples on Amazon.com just don't do it any justice. <br /> <br />Fortunately, I got this as a Christmas gift, and I am really glad I did. <br /> <br />I listened to it on the way to work this morning and was totally surprised how much I like it.   <br /> <br />I wouldn't rank this as good as Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby, but who cares?  It is still a good CD.  I would put this in the same category as All That You Can't Leave Behind (which I also like a lot).   <br /> <br />The CD starts off with Vertigo, which everyone has heard by now (unless you live under a rock). The rest of the CD has a fresh, new sound that is different than anything U2 has ever recorded before. I wouldn't necessarily call it slow or more mellow, but it definitely doesn't sound anything like War or Boy.   <br /> <br />It does have some energy to it, but it might be more appealing to the old-time U2 fans like me (40 year old dads).  I bought my first U2 album back in 1981 when I was a senior in high school.  I hung out with a pretty rough crowd back then.  We mostly listened to bands like Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, The Doors, and Lynyrd Skynyrd.  My friends were totally freaked out when I bought U2 Boy. <br /> <br />Nothing has really changed in 20 years. U2 still makes great music, and I still don't really care what people think. <br /> <br />Don't be afraid to be different.  Don't be afraid to like something that your peers don't like!

B00005JN2Z|3.0|I'm sure this plot has been done before, but I can't think of a time when so I went through the movie not really knowing what to expect.<br /><br />The steps the story takes makes sense and are logical.<br /><br />The suspense filled moments were well directed and kept you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />I appreciate the director also trying to really get into the characters portrayed here vs. having carboard-cut-outs that run around playing role with no depth. You truely care about the \\"good\\" guy and at the same time you get a glimpse into the \\"bad\\" guy and can't help by care about his character too.<br /><br />Jaime Foxx is definitely demonstrating he can do serious roles and not just comedy.<br /><br />It was nice to see Cruise playing a different kind of role too.<br /><br />There is some profanity and violence but light compared to most movies nowadays.<br /><br />OVERALL: Definitely worth watching. Worth owning...I don't know that is up to the viewer and how big of a fan they are of the actors because I don't see the movie itself being one to watch over and over again.
B00005YXZH|4.0|This is a wonderful alternative pop album with folk and country tinges. It does not contain many straightforwardly appealing songs but as a coherant whole it becomes a thing of shimmering beauty. Not a single track is a dud, from the mid-Western love ballad 'Jesus etc' to the downbeat dark builder 'Radio Cure', the sparse 'Ashes of American Flags' and the more straightforward pop of 'War on War' and 'Heavy Metal Drummer'. Tweedy's voice is a thing of beauty, and it is accompanied with twanging acoustic guitars, violins and all kinds of weird, wonderful, yet subtle synths. Closer 'Reservations' is especially lovely and heart-stirringly touching. A wonderful 21st century album rooted in the past with a twist for the future. Almost essential.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Some may say that 'Manos: the Hands of Fate' is the most painful moviegoing experience you'll ever come across.  I chuckle bitterly.  In my book, the coveted title of worst film ever made goes hands-down to Pearl Harbor, a movie so wretched and offensive that one would need sandpaper to scrape off the repulsive slime that it showers its petrified viewers with. <br /> <br />Oh, I almost forgot, this monstrosity actually hit it off with lots of airheaded teens, the kind of people who turn their noses up at Kubrick movies and judge a film's substance based on the quantities of syrupy, awkward soap opera romances and idiotic explosions it contains.  These people gladly accepted the slime coating of Pearl Harbor, which is three excruciating hours of - naturally - pointless soap operas and idiotic explosions.  <br /> <br />No, it wasn't enough for these people to make their stupid airhead teen fantasy, they had to put it into a historical context in order to sucker in more unsuspecting viewers.  What the film really does is disregard the history and the fascinating intrigue behind the attacks.  The Japanese are just stereotypical evil asians and FDR is Jon Voight in pathetic makeup.  Their scenes are done sloppily and half-heartedly.  The majority of this movie is two wooden male JC penny models fighting tediously over a wooden female JC penny model.  <br /> <br />We watched this in History class.  This is a sad commentary on the lazy educational system of America today.
B0000542D2|4.0|A Hard Day's Night is a Beatles classic, and it was high time for it to be spruced up as it is now.  With tons of extra stuff, this is just all a Beatles fan could want. <br /> <br />But about the plot, this film is a whole movie of goofs and inside jokes thrown in with some songs.  This is why it's funny and influential in it's own little way.  The Byrds for example found great inspiration for what they wanted their band to be like after seeing this film. <br /> <br />My only disturbance is that I just don't get some of the jokes, but hey it's still good (and maybe being British helps a bit, although maybe not.) <br /> <br />If you love the Beatles then you'll love this, otherwise you should still like it.

Just those are enough to make viewing THELMA AND LOUISE again a worthwhile experience.<br /><br />A great film, contrary to some perceptions that it is \\"male bashing.\\"  The commentary tracks with the actresses is chatty and fun, in spite of the incongruous presence of screenwriter/producer Khouri (she should have been on the track with the Director.  Putting her with the actress diminishes it into more of a mere \\"chick flick,\\" which it is NOT).<br /><br />Scott's commentary is intelligent, articulate, honest and enlightening.

B00002E233|4.0|I have always been a big fan of JAWS 1 & 2 so when this movie came out I couldn't wait to see it although I was in the 3rd Grade & I had to wait for the video.I really like this movie and I recently bought the d.v.d. which had great deleted scenes on it.I think the original ending that not many people know about because it was booed in the test screening.The original ending was where Saffron Burrows's character Susan escapes the shark and kills it with a spear gun.I read about it on imdb.com & I liked Susan so I think her,Thomas Jane,& LL Cool J surving is a better ending!The film is about test sharks whose brains have been generally altered to find a cure for Alzheimer's but they become smarter and all hell breaks loose!It all comes down to the final 3:Carter,Preach & Susan and Preach survives an attack & Susan uses herself as bait and tries to escape but her plan doesn't work then you'll have to buy the movie to see what happens then!I think this is one of the best action/horror movies ever!
B0006399FS|2.0|The problem with this disc is a poverty of melody, which makes it utterly unengaging.  You can have all the production values, bombast, musicianship, vocal power, socially conscious lyrics, leather-and-sunglasses hipness, and promotion muscle in the world, but if your music isn't engaging melodically, then it's dead on arrival. And, with the exception of \\"Vertigo,\\" that's what's wrong with \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb.\\"  Don't buy into the reviews below that advise multiple listenings make this disc grow on you.  Personally, I don't want anything growing on me (except more hair on my head), and I don't need a CD that requires dozens of listenings to get used to.  Enjoying a CD shouldn't be a chore, and all those \\"acquired taste\\" implorings are faint praise indeed.  I could eventually get used to fingernails on a chalkboard, too, but it's not something I would aspire to.  I'll be burning \\"Vertigo\\" into my MP3 collection and putting the disc into my garage sale this spring.  Achtung, baby.
B0002X314C|5.0|John Legend has lived up to and surpassed expectations.  I have found his cd to be motivating, captivating and soul soothing.  His music takes you on a joy ride from beginning to end.  Great music by a great artist.
B00000637V|4.0|Lou Reed's \\"Berlin came in the strange period when he was trying to get away from the glam-rock days of his previous album, \\"Transformer\\". In fact, if you've not heard much Lou Reed other than \\"Transformer\\", you may not like this album. Nevertheless, it is a great example of Reed's songwriting skills and--in my opinion--one of his best albums. I found the \\"glam-ness\\" of \\"Transformer\\" to be almost a distraction, while \\"Berlin\\" is more like the Lou Reed who lives inside Lou Reed(tm)'s skin. Don't miss the songs \\"The Kids\\", \\"Sad Song\\" and \\"Caroline Says II\\" on this album.
B0002DB52M|5.0|Read the reviews sent to Amazon and you will see that Dogville was either passionately loved or hated. Please include me amongst those that love this film. Only the first few minutes were difficult before I became totally involved. The 3 hour length was not too long. The DVD is a very worthwhile addition to a serious film library.
B00018D44U|1.0|Norah Jones basically embodies everything that is wrong with the world these days when it comes down to music. She proves that selling massive amounts of albums and getting loaded with all kinds of dubious music-awards really doesn't have anything to do with any form of musical ability, or creativity for that matter. Just like her first album, this one is also filled with drowsy, monotonous bores that should pass as 'jazzy' but calling this music jazz is a terrible insult to the genre that gave us Miles Davis, Wayne Shorter, John Coltrane, Herbie Hancock, Andrew Hill, McCoy Tyner, Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald, Charles Mingus, and many more. ' <br /> <br />That's not to say that this music is 'inoffensive'. For most people it IS inoffensive, just pleasant musical wallpaper that doesn't disturb a family dinner or an half an hour of washing the dishes, which declares the ridiculous amount of sales. For me, and thankfully many others who appreciate good music, this music IS offensive. It's mindnumbingly bland easy listening that doesn't even deserve to be labeled as music, but is seen as such, which is an insult. Yes, every song sounds exactly the same as the song before, so why do people spend their hard-earned money on this drivel? It really has some kind of brainwash-effect: after an hour of Norah Jones' easy listening-horror, you'll likely feel like all the blood is sucked right out of your body. If they're looking for something that's inoffensive yet beautiful, why not check out the pianoworks of Satie, or a collection of gorgeous jazz-ballads by Sarah Vaughan? Why does music without a heart and a soul always win from music that IS a product of love and devotion for music? Why does a talentless, lethargic and whining puppet like Norah Jones get tons of airplay for her elevator-music taken to the extreme, and is all the good music pushed to the side? Like I said; just what is wrong with the world these days. I gave up all hope that one day, popularity will be reserved for those musicians who challenge, touch and amaze us with beautiful, exciting music. I personally try not to care and will keep on discovering all the musical gems that the world -thankfully- still has to offer. As for Norah Jones; I'd rather listen to pigs being slaughtered for a full hour than to hear that cursed 'Don't Know Why' for the 6th billionth time. Because I'm so unfortunate that my dad digs her. Spare yourself: avoid at all costs. <br /> <br />
B00005JMYI|1.0|I saw this movie in the theatre and it was a waste of money.  I'm usually a big fan of Will Ferrell, but this movie was very weak for the most part.  There were some funny parts, like when Ron Burgundy was talking to his dog (as another reviewer said) but that was about it.  It's been a while since I saw this movie in the theatre, so I can't remember a lot of specifics.  I do remember being annoyed and bored throughout a good portion of the movie.  One part that just topped on the annoyance scale, were the appearances of Vince Vaughn and Luke Wilson.  It was like the cast of Old School reunited (another movie I was not thrilled with).  These actors need to expand their horizons and try working with different people.  If anyone is looking for a good Will Ferrell movie, go with A Night At the Roxbury.
B000002HH9|4.0|Never quite understood why people always have the tendency to talk after eachother, and even supposed Cure-heads seem to automatically write off Wild Mood Swings as total trash. I mean, 1-star ratings? What does that make of other, really embarassing albums out there? A 1-star rating would mean that there is NO redeeming quality, not one interesting note to be found here whatsoever. It would be welcome if people gave their ratings a little more thought, instead of throwing with 1 (or 5)-star reviews; as if it's nothing. <br /> <br />Having that said, Wild Mood Swing is a totally decent and actually really refreshing album by one of the most brilliant bands out there. Wildy colorful and eclectic in the vein of Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me and The Top; it is number three in The Cure's Trilogy of Color (atleast in my mind). Opening with a familiar rock-monster (Want), the songs and moods really just sprawl over the place. And so we find Bowie-esque rock (Club America), melancholy strings (the beautiful This Is A Lie), weird, sun-drenched mariachi/carribean-tinged experiments (The 13th), shimmery, gorgeous acoustics (Jupiter Crash), heavenly brassy jazz (Gone!) and total euphoria (Mint Car, Round&Round&Round). And more. All on one disc. Wild Mood Swings indeed. <br /> <br />That's not to say that there IS filler on this album, and there certainly are weaker songs on here, most notably the bordering-on-self-parody of Mint Car and some forgettable tracks near the end. But even the weaker songs have some kind of spark that makes it all worthwhile; and the songs are always enjoyable. In the end, what's so refreshing about Wild Mood Swings is that this really is another different side to The Cure; a side often completely stripped of any underlying gloomyness or gothlike-undertone, which was always present on even their older, overtly cheerful singles like The Caterpillar or Just Like Heaven. It's freshness is an honest fresh breeze, and I think on some points, the music is intended to be pleasant and fun and sunny, no strings attached.  <br /> <br />Wild Mood Swings would have been a better album if some songs just would have been cut off, and is not the best starting point for people who just start to take an interest in the Cure. You could better start with Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, which isn't one of my favorites but a good sampler of their abilities and varying sounds. Being as it is, WMS is a wonderful album with a wonderful atmosphere, and the keeper of a few downright gems (Numb, This Is A Lie, Want, Gone!, Jupiter Crash, Treasure). So why is it so popular to slaughter this album? Please be so wise just to investigate the Cure-discography on your own. These reviews can be a guide, but that guide is an uneven one.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|I was not even born when this movie came out in theaters, but thanks to my parents all it took was the VCR for me to fall completely in love with this classic!  I still love this movie today, although I am embarassed to say I hadn't watched it for years until it came out on DVD and I got it for Christmas.  Watching this movie again for me was like riding a bike, I never forgot.  I remember all the words to every song and my favorite part is still when all the chimney sweepers were dancing on the roof and not to mention Dick Van Dyke's routine with the penguins.  As a child, I always wished I could just snap my fingers to clean my room--as I'm sure a lot of other children wished as well. :) I used to jump around the yard with my umbrella open, think I could fly away like Mary Poppins!  The point of me rambling about the significance Mary Poppins had on my childhood is that this movie gets children's imaginations running and will entertain them again and again.   <br /> <br />Aside from how wonderful the movie is, the material featured on the DVD is wonderful.  I've only watched the Making of Mary Poppins, which was so great to get an inside look on one of the greatest films Disney ever made!   <br /> <br />If you have never seen this movie (where have you been?!?) go out and buy this movie...you will not regret it! Even if you don't have kids!
B0002OERI0|4.0|Wow, what a great year for getting music back on track! After the disappointing \\"Warning\\" in 2000 (generally regarded as their weakest effort) Green Day has reinvented themselves with the massive megahit \\"American Idiot.\\" Although it is perhaps a bit too political and biting for some looking for subtleties, Green Day does not let their true feelings die - this and Velvet Revolver's \\"Contraband\\" are two of the best albums of the year, although \\"Idiot\\" does have a bit of filler and that's why I'm giving it 4.5/5. <br /> <br />Oh by the way, I know everyone's going to disagree with me saying it has some filler but unless you're a die-hard Green Day fan, chances are you won't be listening to the other songs as much as American Idiot and Boulevard of Broken Dreams.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|A reviewer below said that Iron Maiden was one of the best acts there that day? I don't think they played, did they? <br />Also, the New York reviewer said that only The Who's \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" and Bowie's \\"Rebel Rebel\\" aired of those sets. In Oklahoma that day, the full Who and Bowie sets aired on MTV (although The Who's cut in and out due to power failures one verse into \\"My Generation,\\" through almost all of \\"Pinball Wizard\\" and during the middle of \\"Won't Get Fooled ...\\" Much (probably ) to bassist John Entwistle's chagrin, the cameras caught him and his roadie scurrying to find an Alembic bass that worked, which stalled The Who's opening number. To my knowledge, Queen didn't perform \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love.\\" My VHS tape from 1985 shows them opening with \\"Bohemian\\" before going into \\"Radio Ga Ga.\\" Different states/cities must have showed different feeds. <br />Anyway, 5 stars for the effort and cause.
B000000OQY|5.0|In between APPETITE and the dual ILLUSIONS Gn'R brought out this album that featured two of their most famous songs - Patience and One in a Million, the latter of which sparked a wave of controvery due to its lyrics, specifically: \\"Immigrants and faggots \ They make no sense to me \ They come to our country \ And think they'll do as they please\\" etc...along with racial slurs and other angry lyrics.    But I think it's one of their best songs and people were too eager to jump on the bandwagon without actually _listening_ to what this song is about. Like always many people are just way too happy to find something to pick apart - One in a Million is lyrically and rhythmically one of Gn'R's greatest hits and no doubt had there not been such a wave of controversy surrounding its release, it would have been featured on the Greatest Hits collection. It's a very dark and different song for Axl but with an acoustic overtone - I love it.    Also included is I Used to Love Her, which I enjoy but have never really loved very much as I can't listen to it over and over again. And frankly the lyrics never sat well with me even if Axl is talking about killing his dog - as someone else mentioned the rhythm is too upbeat. That said, it's still a really good song and something I like to listen to once in a while. (Velvet Revolver also did a really good live cover of it.)    Mama Kin (cover of Aerosmith's version) is a great song and although a bit rough at first [...] you get used to it and the beat is really great and bluesy. This is the type of stuff that should have been used as the \\"filler\\" on the Illusion records instead of some of the overblown stuff they put on there.    Overall this is a really great CD as each song on the disc is worth listening to, and more than a few are wonderful and Gn'R classics. If you're just starting to listen to Gn'R I only advise you to listen to Patience and then store this CD away for later - once you've been through Appetite, take this out againand play it...chances are you'll really love it.
B000002UAR|5.0|Hey look at me! I'm writing a review for The Beatles' \\"Revolver\\"! After this, I'm going to review the Atlantic Ocean and St. Peter's Basillica.    Let's get serious: this musical work is too large, too ingrained in our culture to be rated in a useful way.  This record is \\"great\\" in an objective sense; it is pervasive and persistant in its influence.    Have you ever heard the question, \\"What's the Greatest Rock Band Ever, NOT COUNTING THE BEATLES\\"? I have. This question illustrates the problem with rating the transcendentally great; the rating systems is devised to handle the normal range of art from very good to very bad. There simply is not enough dynamic range to fit the extreme outlier into the system. If the Beatles get 5 stars, then who else can you give that rating to?    You already know all about \\"Revolver\\", my personal favorite Beatles album. For any other band, this could be a Greatest Hits, but it was just one of the Beatles' best offerings. \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" on one album? Are you kidding me?
B000000P17|4.0|It's easy to see why THE SPAGHETTI INCIDENT? was almost universally trashed by critics upon its release in 1993. First of all, Guns N' Roses was no longer \\"cool.\\" The Pacific Northwest grunge music genre (Nirvana, Pearl Jam) was taking hold of the rock world. Axl's antics had become infamous. Izzy Stradlin had left, the band's internal crumbling had made the headlines and frankly after the \\"disappointment\\" of the Use Your Illusion records, even fans were starting to tune out at this point. It's sort of sad looking at the inside cover of the Spaghetti CD and literally being able to _read_ the band's failure - it's like they know they're about to die and even the booklet is depressing. <br /> <br />That said, the album is very good. Like most of Guns N' Roses' earlier songs it takes multiple listens - when I first heard \\"November Rain,\\" for example, I didn't care for it much. Now, it's one of my favorite songs. Ditto \\"Sweet Child\\". <br /> <br />SPAGHETTI is understandably underrated but that doesn't necessarily mean it's justified. If people had actually been opening their ears in '93 they'd have realized that Gn'R was trying some really daring stuff with this CD - and at the same time returning to their blues-rock roots that they had abandoned (for the most part) for the overblown \\"Illusion\\" double bill. Apart from GET IN THE RING and SHOTGUN BLUES, \\"Illusion\\" I & II was mostly softer/harder rock with modernized stuff (like violins and background singers). <br /> <br />SPAGHETTI INCIDENT is punk rock/blues with covers of little-known songs such as \\"Down on the Farm\\" (which features Axl doing a great British slang) and \\"Human Being\\" (which, for my money, is one of Gn'Rs' best songs of all time - loud, fast, with a great rhythm). <br /> <br />This is not to say SPAGHETTI is flawless. Of 12 songs many are short (with the whole CD clocking in at just over an hour) and a few are mere filler - HAIR OF THE DOG and ATTITUDE simply being loud and obnoxious. <br /> <br />However this does contain two classics (included in the Greatest Hits collection) - Since I Don't Have You and Ain't it Fun. For my money the former of the two is a bit better but both have attitude and rhythm and an infectious style. Axl's voice is very interesting here and he challenges himself more than he has before with a variety of punk/rock/blues songs that all contain different styles. <br /> <br />Overall it's easy to see why this was trashed when it came out - but the critics were really blind to the pros of this album. After they seemed to disappoint a lot of fans with the commercialized Use Your Illusions Gn'R tried to return to their roots with SPAGHETTI - and I think they succeeded rather well. <br /> <br />Just listen to \\"Human Being\\" a few times and see if you can't start getting into it.
B00004RYZT|5.0|This is a fantastic concert with one caveat.  The DVD release omits the song \\"Bueck Dich\\" in its entirety because of some pseudo sexual antics the band engaged in onstage.  What was the logic here?  It already existed on the VHS version of the tape, but the U.S. release of the DVD it was censored/edited out.  Why?  The DVD already bears the \\"Parental Advisory\\" label, so what the heck?  It's a little disconcerting to me that that no mention of or warning is given of number(s) taken out, so you may (I did) feel a little shortchanged of the full concert.   <br /> <br />Having said that, what we do get on the DVD is nothing short of spectacular with Deutschland's ber band putting on a show that rivals easily the very best super stadium productions here in America.  Rammstein does it with more flair and theatricality than anyone - and their pyrotechnics are the best in the business.  What lead singer other than Till Lindemann can make an entrance completely engulfed in flames?  The show is spectacular and the audience goes nuts, singing along through this great, great night. <br /> <br />As good a concert video as you will ever see and hear.  Rammstein Rules!
B00005JMAH|5.0|I got this DVD as a Christmas present.  I own the other two Harry Potter movies and have read all of the books.  I had heard that this third installment wasn't all that great... but I am pleasantly surprised with just how good it was... I thoroughly enjoyed it!  Not all movies follow the books... if they did why would they be made into movies?  I'm glad that I got this and will enjoy watching it over and over
1592400876|3.0|Am I the only one in all of the thousands who have read this book that noticed the terrible comma splice on page 28?  \\"Sticklers unite, you have nothing to lose but your sense of proportion, and arguably you didn't have a lot of that to begin with.\\"  The first comma should be a period or a semicolon. <br /> <br />Before even completing the first chapter, Truss makes a bald-faced grammatical mistake while arrogantly pointing out those of other people.  Har har.
B000002O4S|3.0|There's some good tunes on here. There's nothing I would describe as bad per se. Actually I only bought the soundtrack for one song, \\"Time Bomb Town\\" by Lindsey Buckingham. As far as I know it cant be got anywhere else. There's a very nervous, almost paranoid quality to this song, not just in the lyrics, but in Buckinghams odd vocal touches and the arrangment. Great stuff IMO, others may disagree...
B0002X314C|5.0|This HAS to be one of the best albums of the year.  I bought it and have not stopped listening to it since.  Every song is powerful and dynamic.  John Legend is truly a great artist.  Buy the CD; you will LOVE it!!!!
B0002F6BRE|1.0|Everyone went on about how cute and funny this was... yeah, maybe if you find stupidity amusing.  A man is left with elves and ends up going to look for his father.  He believes he's an elf so of course he tells his father this, which thinks he's crazy.  The entire movie was a waste of time, and it had about 1 funny part.
0887307280|5.0|First off, this book is NOT meant to be a guide to franchising, as so many people have perceived it. Gerber just uses large franchisors as examples of successful businesses. Why? Because they have sold their business model many times over, and therefore proved that it works.    He advises you to think of your business AS a franchise, but not literally, unless you want to. He goes into great detail, explaining that your business should be thought of as a product that should be sellable many times over and be people-independent. That is, be able to survive without depending on the skills of people within the business.     He believes the major difference between large corporations and franchises, with that of failed and failing businesses, is STRUCTURE and having SYSTEMS in place. Of course, the be all and end all of a successful business isn't just structure, but it obviously attributes a large part to the success.     If anyone has gone from working in a large successful company, no matter what position held, onto a small premature business, you'll understand when I say how much of a shock it is to go from having so many guidelines and systems to follow, to having none.    Gerber finishes by providing practical information regarding marketing, management, and naturally suggests further reading in those areas.    This book should be the foundation for anyone thinking of going into business.
B00028HBKM|5.0|The movie was very realistic. I felt as if I stepped back 2000 years ago to witnesses the final hours of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Mel Gibson and his cast did a fantastic job.
0345457684|3.0|I haven't read all of the 105 reviews that precede this one, but none of the ones I did read clearly point out the great waves of stomach-churning violence that fill this book---I'm talking things like eyes being pulled out with pliers and blowtorches applied to feet.  There are a couple of equally graphic sex scenes.  I won't be reading the sequels.    This is a shame, because the evocation of 25th century San Francisco is excellent, complete with new technologies surrounded by a (mostly) believable culture and argot.  There is one giant logical flaw, though: no one backs up their key data.  Even those who are smart enough to make one copy never make two, to their ultimate sorrow.  Maybe this is inteded as wry commentary on people like me who often fail to make back-ups of own our key data.  Or maybe not.
0316666343|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book.  I did not want it to end.  Alice Seabold is a great writer and I can not wait for her to come out with some thing new.  I have recommended this book to so many people.  I love how the story is told from the point of view of the dead girl looking down on everyone.  This is a MUST read.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This is a movie every American must watch.  Many of the other reviewers critique McNamara's honesty, and whether he really apologizes for things for which the various reviewers think he needs to apologize (or not), so I won't dwell further there. <br /> <br />To me, the one thing I'm surprised more people don't talk about is the information he shares about what he learned well after-the-fact about the Cuban Missile Crisis.  If you believe what RSM says (based on his conversations with Castro), had we invaded Cuba (as all of Kennedy's military advisors strongly advised him to do), they would have launched their already-operational nuclear missiles at the US, and would have killed about 80 million Americans (about 1/3 of the population of the US).  That Kennedy refused to consider the military option saved those lives; it seems that simple.  If THAT alone doesn't make him our greatest President (for all of his other well-documented failings), I simply don't know what does.
B0002YLC24|5.0|but I can see how someone else may find this movie boring.  The entire movie is made with the two characters conversing with each other, and, other than the few extras--mainly in the backgroud--they are both the only 'real' characters in the entire movie.  I found this movie to be entertaining and romantic, in a different way.  I like it enough that I'm about to purchase the dvd ;D
1563898586|5.0|First I have to comment on the artwork in this book.  It is probably the best I have seen since reading graphic novels as an adult.  Oftentimes I found myself lost in the artwork just looking at everything going on in the panel and losing the dialog.  That may not sound like a good thing, but it really allows you to enjoy the book in a much deeper way than you normally would.  You are really able to dive into the setting.  You are seeing an ultra-industrial world with loose morals set at the end of victorian times, and you can see all the details of what that means in the artwork. <br /> <br />Of course, add on top of that the excellent writing of Alan Moore and you have yet another level of enjoyment.  The plot is actually not very special.  It's sort of a \\"put together the superteam - do a mission - realize you were betrayed\\" type deal.  However, doing that story in a different era with a set of characters many folks my age have forgotten, as well as the interesting details when moving between those plot points more than makes up for the simple plot.  The subtle humor adds to the story and is integrated with the artwork well.  Quartermain's eyes bulging had me chuckling each time I saw it. <br /> <br />I saw the movie version of the league a while ago and thought it was an ok popcorn flick... I didn't realize how pitiful the movie really was until I read the source material.  The movie captures none of the world created in the artwork, settings and language used in these books.
B00005JLEU|2.0|\\"Spirited Away\\" and it's worldwide praise, is a testament to how gullible the mainstream public are to Anime now, this film, based on various fantasty aspects and plot cliques is really nothing that we have seen before from previous films of it's calibure. <br /> <br />Haunted bath houses, magical creatures, the evolution of a spoiled brat into a stronger, more independent person, the quest to restore and find loved ones, a loved one turning into a beutfiul animal warrior...please tell me with a straight face you have not seen this kind of thing before, and that \\"Spirited Away\\" is original in it's execution and delivery of these alleged new concepts and plot twists, you can't, you won't, because you know just like I do this is a very weak movie when you have the capacity to carefully and logically THINK. <br /> <br />Is \\"Spirited Away\\" a masterpeice? Maybye if they had produced it in 1993, and not several years later where other animes have long since used and surpassed what is featured in this movie here to greater advantage
B000088DTS|4.0|This is just an average CD - not meaning that it is bad, but it just passes 3 stars.<br />Firstly, the 3x platinum lead single BORN TO TRY was very overrated. What is so good about it? The whole song sounds the same - the verse is pretty much the same of the chorus, and it is just too boring to me. 5/10<br /><br />Next, INNOCENT EYES comes on. It is my favourite track. It was the third single and went platinum. It has a very uplifting and catchy melody. It is about Delta reflecting on her childhood. See - the video clip. 10/10<br /><br />NOT ME, NOT I is another born to try-like song. It never really goes anywhere. It is better though. The intro is very innocent-eyes like, and a very catchy verse - this could be an extrememly good if it had a better chorus. It is just a bit too boring too me. 7/10<br /><br />THROW IT AWAY - I don't think the acoustic guitar is really built for Delta. Her vocals areat thier peak here, though this is another song I don't really like. 7/10<br /><br />LOST WITHOUT YOU is the second single, which went double platinum in Australia. It was the first song of hers which I really liked. But it gets boring after a while, so I have to minus two points. 8/10<br /><br />PREDICTABLE is the fifth single and it went double platinum. It is the most rockish track on the album and I the fans favourite (I think). It has a very uplifting chorus. 9/10<br /><br />BUTTERFLLY is a wonderful ballad, but I think if it was acoustic it would be better. It is too synthesised for a 10, but it's just that piano really suites this song. A lot of emotion in this track. 9/10<br /><br />IN MY OWN TIME was featured on the Born To Try single and is yet another ballad. The lyrics are a bit corny, but that doen't stop it being a very good song. Molto excellento. 8/10<br /><br />THIS IS NOT ME was a song the below reviewer  (that is if I don't get a spotlight review which is very unllikely) only gave 6/10. I think this is a very great track where Delta G. really goes for it. And expresses her emotions in her tone, rather than the production, or the lyrics. 10/10<br /><br />RUNNING AWAY is good for a while (5/10) and A YEAR AGO TODAY is quite a good ballad which Delta made a video clip for, for some reason.

B0002ZDVEU|3.0|...not surprising since there's a different director---Paul Greengrass isn't bad, he just isn't anywhere as good as Doug Lyman, who did \\"The Bourene Identity.\\"<br /><br />Lyman's film flowed effortlessly and seamlessly...it was difficult to immediately recognize the standard plot structure, e.g. \\"Oh, this is Act One, and oh, now we're moving into Act Two, and now this is the clean resolution of Act Three.\\"  Unlike the first Bourne movie, there are a few slow spots here, and killing off Franka Potente during the first ten minutes of the film most DEFINITELY doesn't help matters whatsoever.<br /><br />In fact, this film is pretty much painting-by-numbers: we know full well that Bourne is going to be out to avenge his oh-so-cute German babe, and that again he is being framed for something he didn't do but that he will again prevail agaisnt all odds.  Even the fight scenes (there's only one really major one) are weak, and when we see him escape half of the Berlin police force by climbing up the side of a building yet AGAIN it's hard not to make another beer run.  While in some respects more spectacularly filmed due to Greengrass's documentary-making background than the one in the first film (through Paris), the Big Car Chase through the streets of Moscow also feels rehashed.<br /><br />Then there is the penultimate BIG DRAMATIC SCENE in which Bourne apologizes to one of his past victims...dialogue, acting, and camera are all wrong, and it's hard not to feel sorry for Matt Damon being stretched far beyond his limited abilities as an actor.<br /><br />If such things above don't bother you, chances are you'll enjoy this movie just fine.  Joan Allen easily has the best screen presence in this film and is a pleasure to watch.  This DVD is very well-stocked with all kinds of bonus features, so if you liked this film in the cinema it would probably be worth owning.<br /><br />Me personally, Netflixing it once was enough.
0446604844|3.0|Albeit this is not the best Baldacci's book is a readable one, the first pages are heavy as lead though, but if you go through the first 150 or so pages the rest of the book is good enough to end it. You can also skip the part when the book explains how the economy works and what happen if the interest rate gets up or down. Maybe you will have to be in mood to read this one but at the end of it you will not regret reading it.<br />I think this book'd be better if were written after the WTC massacre.
B000002NG7|2.0|When I first heard Faith No More was putting out an album called, \\"Album of the Year\\", I got pumped.  I knew \\"King For a Day/Fool for a Lifetime\\" was a flop, so I thought this was the bands attempt at getting back on track.  I was sadly mistaken.  This album, to my amazement, got very good reviews at the time it was released.  I just didn't see it.  \\"Last Cup of Sorrow\\" was a decent song, as was \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", but other than that, I saw nothing but a collection of mediocre to weak songs, most of them being more on the weak side.<br /><br />This was a disappointing end to a band that started off with a tremendous bang, with \\"The Real Thing\\", and \\"Angel Dust\\".  Two remarkable albums.  I wish I could say the band members moved onto better things, but if you call Mike Patton's insanely childish ramblings in his 17 other bands good music, all power to you.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Being an Agnostic, (let me clear this up for those who don't know what an Agnostic is...I believe in God, just not organized religions, none of them seem to get it right) this movie was not high on my list to watch. We recieved it for christmas from the kids, who said it was a great movie. It is. I believe that Mr. Gibson was attempting to make a historical movie, not so much a religious one. Jesus was never a threat to the Roman Empire, and there is a question as to whether Ceasar even knew who he was. Pilate, who over the last couple centuries has been the villain in this sad tale, was actually a poor schmuck caught in an impossible political situation, with his head literally on the line if he made the wrong choice. I cannot condemn the Jewish heirarchy for their fears either, they saw more and more of their followers beginning to leave their faith and embrace this new \\"Messiah's\\" teachings, some of which did not comply with their accepted codes. Very scary in those days. If what Jesus said is true, then this all had to happen...one way or another..so no one could have prevented it. <br />As to the blood and gore.....well not many people fully realized what scourging was until it was depicted in this film. Now they do. It was a horrifying and ugly punishment, and many people died from even a moderate scourging, but it was a common practice in those times. Very few people went to prison in those days, except to await sentencing, your punishment was meted out physically or you were put to death. Believe me, if you do study history, you'll find much worse punishments than scourging and crucifixon. Check out Asia for inovative tortures and ugly death. <br />I thought the film did a great job developing characters, and trying to truly capture the events that happend so long ago. As to Mr. Gibson reaping the \\"gold\\", well he earned it. He spent his own money to make this film, wouldn't compromise on the quality of any part of it, went to great lengths to make it historically accurate and has endured a great deal of abuse for it. If you are a hysterical, bible thumping, religious fanatic of any genre, you will probably hate this movie. Doesn't quite fit the \\"accepted\\" version. But it is probably the most historically accurate account we have seen to date. Highly recommend.
B000053VAF|1.0|Even the people who defend Kevin Smith constantly complain about what a horrible director he is.  \\"He can't frame a shot to save his life\\" and so forth.  Like I've always said, you'd think someone who spent his life reading comic books would have a better visual style.<br /><br />But I can't really see what else Smith does to deserve such a fervent following.  Is it 15-year-old stoners cheering the trashing of the Catholic church?  This is the type of movie that a video game juvenile junky can watch and think they're experiencing a deep and weighty comedy.  Instead, it's just smug and condescending.  And not as funny as it thinks it is.<br /><br />Jay and Silent Bob have overstayed their welcome longer than Anna Nicole Smith.  They're not exactly Abbott & Costello.  They're not even Pauly Shore & that one Baldwin brother from BIO-DOME.<br /><br />I can't even get through DOGMA without switching it off: I can only take so much mugging.
0765309408|4.0|First the bad.  I found the first few chapters somewhat annoying.  The author goes a bit too far with his bunch of wise-cracking, smart-mouthed Americans in space. It feels like he was trying to be a bit too smart with his characters, who seem to have dialogue modelled straight out of a mindless Hollywood action movie.  Get past that though and the story really takes off.  I literally couldn't put it down and as a consequence had to struggle through work the next day in a lethargic haze.  The story is exciting and moves quickly.  Its not as original or as well-written as Haldeman's Forever War, but who cares, this is a fun novel that really draws you in. An excellent first novel.
0064407667|4.0|I have been wanting to read this series for some time now. When I finally got my hands on a copy, I read the whole first book in one day. The text is very understandable. The author did a good job on giving definitions of some words that aren't used much.  I can't wait to read more from the series.
0312995423|1.0|I read DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons, and loved them both. This book fell FAR short. The plot twists are very clumsy and obvious. The plot revolves around cryptography and the internet. Brown made two flaws (well, the same flaw with two facets) he included too much detail in the methods that the technology in his plot used.  For people who are technical, and understand how cryptography actually works, the book is painful to read, because he has major fundamental flaws with the way that crypto works. Suspension of disbelief is totally trashed. For people who aren't technical, the details he includes add no value, and are too confusing to understand.  If he had been more vague, both groups would have been better off. <br /> <br />For a book that deals with the subject of crypto intelligently, go with Cryptonomicon, by Niel Stephenson.
0380977788|5.0|Usually with many books, I find that it is difficult to \\"get into it.\\" But with Coraline, I found that it grabbed me right from the first sentence. I couldn't tear myself away from the book once I started reading it. I wanted to  keep reading. It was a type of 'scary' that kept me in suspense. After finishing this wonderfully written book, I knew that I wanted to write a review for this book to recruit others to read this. I can guarantee that Coraline will become a favorite of yours.
B00007K02F|2.0|I had just finished the novel before watching this version of Jane Eyre and I was totally disappointed by the weak attempt to portray its depth in film. It was a thin, papery frame, really, of the events in the novel - it left out SO much and the characters were so terribly under developed. Jane, thoughout the novel, is so delicately molded into a fun, teasing, and brilliant young lady and Mr. Rochester into a passionately devoted man. In the movie, NONE of this took place - Mr. Rochester was too quiet and mean, and Jane was entirely too BORING! She had one tone and one way of acting - portraying absolutely NO DEPTH! Scenes that are supposed to develop their relationship were completely deleted, the ending was rushed, etc, etc. Overall, not good!
B00005JMX6|4.0|This movie is about a timid, scholarly, high school student named Matthew (Emile Hirsche) and the hot, former porn star that moves in next door to him named Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert).  The two fall in love and have a positive effect on each other.  Danielle teaches Matthew that he can be successful without doing everything strickly by the book and can still have fun, and Matthew teaches Danielle that she has better things to do with her life than make pornographic movies.  Along the way, Matthew's two friends, Klutz and Eli, add humor to the movie, as does Danielle former porn director, who tries to make Matthew's life hell for stealing Danielle from him. <br /> <br />Before seeing this movie, I was confused as to whether it was supposed to be billed as a comedy or a melodrama.  After watching it, I would say that it is more like the later.  It has humorous moments, but I wouldn't say that it is akin to American Pie.  Instead, it is about high school losers that are actually played by actors that look like high schoolers, not mid-twenty something actors pretending to be younger.  And these guys really are losers, not just guys that can't get any.  The movie is sexually driven, but is more about love than sex and has a number or sexual themes, but isn't about people just trying to get sex. <br /> <br />Despite the more realistic cast of the movie, many parts of the plot are largely fictional.  The movie only deals with the glamorous, sexy, side of the pornographic industry and not its actual dirty, self-demeaning, drug and disease ridden reality.  Obvisouly, this would not make a happy movie.  Yet, The Girl Next Door is a rather happy movie where everything seems to easily come together for all of the characters at the movie's end and everyone is happy, which is pure fiction. <br /> <br />Although it is not a realistic movie, I still found myself liking it.  I felt a little sympathy for Matthew and his troubles, and think that Elisha Cuthbert did a good job balancing the innocent, girl next door look of Danielle, and the sex goddess Athena.  Overall, the movie wasn't anything spectacular, but is a general feel-good movie and lacks the looming sappyness that is apparent in other high school movies such as \\"The Perfect Score.\\"  Instead, it presented a somewhat unrealistic, yet rather unique look into the often over stereotyped high school experience.
B00005V331|5.0|WELCOLME TO HELL was the second Venom album i got after BLACK METAL,and to be queit honest i was disapointed with it at first because it wasn't as polished or dark as BLACK METAL was. For one thing, the production here is very low, almost demo qaulity, but i realized that this only adds to the general feel of the album and i think it was a god(or satan)send in the end.Well,now i have to name this as my favorite Venom album (BLACK METAL is right behind it though),it took time for me to digest this album because of it's abrasivness and it might for you as well, but songs like \\"sons of Satan\\" the title track \\"shiziod\\" \\"poison\\" \\"live like an angle\\" and the power crusher \\"1000 of Sodom\\" are some of the heaviest compositions ever to grace wax, i ain't kiddin, this makes any MotorHead album sound like Peter,Paul and Mary. WELCOLME TO HELL doesn't let up, it's non stop brutality, no slow or fillers here.It's really interesting to know that this album singlehandedly created the BlackMetal,Thrash and Death metal gendres all at once when it cane out in 81.
B00005JKN9|1.0|I cannot really believe that people actually like this movie.  People nowadays only like movies when they are violent, bloody, and without any storyline worth watching. <br /> <br />I went with a friend to the movie theatre to see what people were calling \\"a masterpiece\\" and we left a little over half way through because the movie made us both sick.  The only interesting part in this movie was the first 15 minutes with Liam Neeson.  After that scene, the movie went downhill fast. <br /> <br />First of all, there was no story or plot.  The film just went from one blood and guts scene to another.  We stayed as long as we did because we thought, \\"this movie has been such a disappointment, it HAS to get better by improving and having a storyline.\\"  After discussing it with friends (after we had left the theatre), we learned that the storyline got no better whatsoever -- it was just more scenes of carnage all the way to the end.  Why would anyone call this a masterpiece?  A masterpiece would actually have to have some sort of intelligent plot or storyline.  UGH <br /> <br />Daniel-Day Lewis was laughable in his fake mustache and unbelieveably fake accent.  He is a terrible actor and has never been good in anything I have ever seen him in.  Why do so many people think he is good?  I cannot imagine why. <br /> <br />I do not write reviews trying to say one director is better or another director is better.  A good movie may have a totally UNKNOWN director.  The reviewers for this movie are all fixated and obsessed with Martin Scorcese.  Who cares?  Just because he directs something, it doesn't make it a good movie.  Steven Spielberg has made some DUDs too.  I have no respect for a director who cannot even come up with dialog/storyline worth making into a movie. <br /> <br />Leonardo DiCaprio is awful, as usual.  I suppose that is not saying much. <br /> <br />Nothing makes this movie worth watching. It was boring, uninteresting, gory and without any redeeming quality.  Whydid anyone even bother?  It was a waste of time and money. If I could give this movie a \\"negative-5 stars\\", I would.
0792843584|5.0|Okay, Rog, \\"poorly filmed\\", huh. It's shot among some of the most beautiful landscapes of our country for starters. Every freaking shot counts, as if it were a moving painting, the field of view is the canvas in every scene. Some of the shots are even filmed in a hazy yellow, perfect. What better way to portray a western sunset feeling then to make everything the color of the sunset? And it's not like it's out of place, not like if it were red or green or anything. It is just in the realm enough that it seems like it was just shot with old film. I can see why many people wouldn't like it in our day and age, though, especially if they are for the American government at this point, because it is the same crap that is happening. The rich hire the poor and weak to kill the poor and weak and on an even lower note, the main characters couldn't change their class as much as they wanted to. They just were who they were, who they were destined to be in a way. So many subjects are touched on throughout the film, it is surprising that so many critics missed them. This is a film made for a reader's mentality. A must see film.

B00002MZ4V|4.0|Love the selections on this wonderful grouping of top hits, however, I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the recordings.

B0002VKZL6|5.0|My favorite album of 2004 and my favorite Knopfler work since Communique.  Lots of beautiful melodies that get stuck in my head and many touching, human lyrics.  Schmalzy on a couple tracks, but generally very moving and honest.    Fans of Money For Nothing, What It Is, and Sultans of Swing will probably be disappointed, however, because there are no extended guitar solos (fair warning!).  Other reader's comments/criticisms about the slowness of the album are fair, but for some reason that didn't bother me (it usually does... such as with the great Knopfler sleeping pill, Sailing to Philadelphia).  Fans who dig Clapton or Dylan are more likely to enjoy this album than fans of Jimi Hendrix or Van Halen.  It's more artsy-fartsy and less kick-[...], but it is top-notch artsy-fartsy.    After two months of listening, I still haven't gotten tired of the following tracks in the least: 5:15, Trawlerman's Song, and Postcards to Paraguay.  I'd especially suggest these for a listen.
B000667FN8|1.0|First of all, Simple PLan isn't punk....they are pretty boy pop singers that try and rip off great punk bands like green day and such. Second, if you can listen to the singer's voice without throwing up, then ur gifted cause i can't stand this guy. Bands like simple plan, good charlotte, and yellowcard are crappy pop bands that teenage girls buy and say are punk. If you want good punk albums check out offspring's smash, any of green day's cds, and rancid's out come the wolves. those are just some bands that own these geek losers... but alot are better than \\"simple plan\\" and such. <br /> <br /> <br /> Take my advice and DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00009Z574|5.0|I'm one of the very small group who think that Tormato was Yes' best album. Sure, I love most of what they did through 90125, KTA1&2 and Magnification (Tales is awesome). However, what they did on Tormato was unique. There is no other album that conjurs as many visual images as that album. It's probably cliche to say it...but the album was a sonic tapestry, a canvas they painted soundscapes on. <br /> <br />Yes, there were some kitchy moments. While a decent song, I never felt that \\"Don't KIll the Whale\\" belonged on the album. <br /> <br />If you never heard Tormato because of all the bad things you heard about it, you are missing out on an important step in Yes' evolution. Be prepared, however, because it's not your typical Yes fare.
B0002YLC24|1.0|This movie is so objectionable on so many different levels, I almost don't know where to begin.<br /><br />It is slow, boring, and tired.  Ethan Hawke stammers so many times you wonder if he cracked his head getting off the Metro and addled his brains.  Julie Delpy is so old looking, worn out and haggerdy.  Her character's frequent soapboxing is tired too.<br /><br />I don't see much between these characters.  Clearly Julie Delpy's character is deeper, more introspective.  She challenge's Ethan Hawke's character several times, and all he can do is stammer and leer.<br /><br />Ethan is married, yet he is obviously more than ready to fling his committments aside and make a little French Connection (pardon the pun).  This is disturbing.  I mean, it is not like these two characters had some sort of deep or long lasting relationship.  They met briefly, talked, flirted, and drifted apart.  Now, ten years later, he is willing to throw aside his responsibilities for her.<br /><br />The movie is mostly about talk.  Talk, talk, talk.  Mostly Julie Delpy's character blathering on and on and on and on about life and wicked imperialistic nations like....America.<br /><br />WARNING TO AMERICANS:  If a single patriotic cell exists inside your body, you may not want to rent, watch, or buy this movie.  Before Sunset is just another attempt by the left-wing, America-hating Movie Industry to stir up anti-American sentiments.  In this pathetically lousy flick, they cast the United States of America in the role of BIG BAD OPRESSOR, Land of Rape and Murder (watch for Julie Delpy's character's little \\"boo-hoo, sniff-sniff\\" speech early in the film about how she, the poor little sheltered French girl trembled with fear during a visit to America (where people are raped and abused by the police).  Her little diatribe about how an American policeman waved a gun about and basically threatened her was ridiculous and nauseating.<br /><br />The film makes it look like Paris is a haven, a cosmopositan but quaint world-class city with no crime, and New York City is a cesspool of murder and rape.  Interesting, considering the following statistics found on the International Crime Statistics Comparison website:<br /><br />Here are Interpol 2001 crime statistics (rate per 100,000):<br /><br />4161 - US<br />7736 - Germany<br />6941 - France<br />9927 - England and Wales<br /><br />Thus the US has a substantially lower crime rate than the major European countries!<br /><br />Here are the Interpol 1995 crime statistics (rate per 100,000):<br />5278 - US<br />8179 - Germany<br />6316 - France<br />7206 - England & Wales<br /><br />Besides the clearly WE HATE AMERICA, THE BIG BAD OPRESSIVE IMPERIALISTIC NATION message, the film just. . . sucks Seine water.<br /><br />I am a bonafide Francophile and adore France, but I am also a patrotic American.

B0006A9FMI|2.0|This has to be the saddest excuse for a DVD I've ever wasted money on. Let me get this straight right off: I LIKE subtitles! it's far better to hear the original voices with their emotional inflections and character intact, even if you need subtitles to get the actual meaning. This disk though contains not a normal English vocal subtitle track, but one designed for the hearing impaired (and not a very good one even at that, does a deaf person really need to be told that an aquarium with obvious air bubbles rising is making a \\"Bubbling sound\\"?) These intrusive popups of notations like \\"footsteps\\" or \\"gunshots\\" simply mar the sumptuous visuals, and became so annoying that I couldn't even bring myself to finish the whole movie. Someone at Dreamworks seriously needs to seek more productive employment in the food service industry....

B00004U60I|5.0|My 5 month old daughter received the BE Baby Bach video several months ago as a belated shower gift for me. My daughter loves the DVD and I talk to her about what is on the TV. It is counterproductive for parents to use the BE series as a baby-sitter. As one of the reviewers stated in a review of another BE DVD, these products are to be used WITH your child. I find it helpful to talk about colors one day, sizes or shapes the next, and music on another day. Granted, I know at 5 months she does not understand exactly what I am telling her, however, I do believe that the earlier shapes, colors, sizes, music, sounds, animals, etc. are introduced and REINFORCED, the more your child will get out of the BE program, and you will get to spend quality educational time with your infant/baby/toddler. I am sold on BE and even though the videography is simple, it is better than my daughter watching other pre-school programming on TV. At least I have some control over what she is exposed to and I get the added bonus of spending educational time with her!
0142000663|5.0|The Grapes of Wrath, I remember distinctly having to read in high school, and I hated it. Now, years later, I sat down and read it again, and had so much more of an appreciation for the book and the depth at which John Steinbeck was getting to in his portrayal of the Joads' trip to California in search of the American Dream.<br /><br />The story has both allegorical as well as literal elements to it. Set during the depression in the 1930s, it is the tale of the migrant farm workers from Oklahoma who leave the South for a chance at better job opportunities and life in the West. Specifically, we follow the path of the Joad family in their journey, and they use a rickety old truck that can barely fit the entire family to head westward. There are some from the community who refuse to go because of their principles, namely Grandpa Joad, who holds strongly to his belief that leaving Oklahoma is admitting defeat. Tom Joad, who recently got out of jail, and Jim Casy, a former preacher, join the family on their way west. Along the way, the Joads have several mishaps and disasters, and the family tries to stay together and maintain their hope that once they get there, everything will work out for the better.<br /><br />One of the more interesting characters in the novel is that of Jim Casy. He continually tells the family that he is no preacher when they want him to recite some type of prayer for them, yet, despite his protests, his role to the family and significance in the book is critical to their faith, as he represents a \\"moral\\" voice in the book. He is also responsible for the transformation of Tom Joad, the book's protagonist, who slowly begins to look at life from different viewpoints after meeting the preacher, and, by the end of the book, has changed his outlook.<br /><br />Among one of the great aspect of the novel is Steinbeck's descriptions of 1930s California. Some may think that this is tedious to read in a novel, as we have many chapters sole devoted to descriptions of the Central Valley and its scenery, as well as the situations of the migrant workers, but it seems to me an essential tool in establishing the context from which this novel was written. In effect, it really paints a picture of what life was like for many who made the trip west, and their difficulties along the way.<br /><br />Not only is the novel a testament to the situation of the migrants in the 30s, but it depicts and indirectly criticizes man's inhumanity towards others in times of need. This is represented in the plight of the Joads, who represent a microcosm of a family in need during this time. These families get shuffled around from place to place, and try to keep their dignity and hopes up despite the lack of compassion from some of the landowners.<br /><br />I'd say that, if you have to read this in high school and don't like it, try it again a few years later down the line. There is also a movie version of this book, with Henry Fonda, from the 1940s, an excellent film that is quite faithful to the book.to descriptions of the Central Valley and its scenery, as well as the situations of the migrant workers, but it seems to me an essential tool in establishing the context from which this novel was written.

Oh and the actor who plays Jesus also played a psychotic killer.  Back to earth folks.  It's a Mel Gibson production.
0767834739|5.0|When Resident Evil : Apocalypse was finally announced for it's theatrical release, no one was more excited than me. Being both a fan of the games, and a fan of the first movie, I had high expectations for what this one could be, and it did indeed live up to what I expected.  <br /> <br />It seems my main complaint with the first movie, that it didn't have anything to do with the characters or events or the game, were taken care of in the sequel. Jill Valentie (Sienna Guilloy) makes her big screen debut as she bursts onto the screen as one of the bad-ass gunslinging heroines. She doesn't seem very much like the Jill from the RE games, but she dresses and looks very similar to her. My only question left would be, Where's Chris? Instead of Chris we get Carlos (Oded Fehr) who's an alright character. Doesn't seem to really stand out or be that special though. All the questions from the first movie are also effectively answered in the second. The T-Virus has broken out into Raccoon city, and now it's citizens are in mass paranoia. Umbrella has to contain the incident by isolating the virus or destroying the city. Alice (Milla Jovovich) the heroine from the last movie awakes in the lab where we saw her in the last movie. She then removes the cords from her body and walks out into the street and grabs a shotgun from a crashed police car (much like in the ending of the last movie). Alice ends up coming into contact with Jill and some others during her quest to get out of the city. Eventually the programmer of the T-Virus, Dr. Ashford, calls Alice and Jill and makes a deal with them that if they can get his daughter from the Junior High, he will help them escape. This is where the movie really surprised me, because I guess my brain just didn't make the connection between Ashford and the first movie. I mean he's not even in it. But we all remember the little red girl who was the image of the computer in the first movie? Well guess who doctor Ashford's daughter is? It's quite surprising to see her in real life, but as soon as I heard her talk, my brain mad the connection. So now you have some background knowledge, so that you will catch that. The main villian of the movie is Nemesis. If you've seen the last movie you remember at the end where Matt and Alice are coming out of the mansion and then a group of umbrella workers surround them. They see Matt mutating and then say \\"Put him in the Nemesis program\\". Much of the movie has to do with Alice remembering Matt, and now seeing him as Nemesis. You'll quickly learn that Alice and Nemesis have ultimately been programmed to fight eachother, and see who is the greater power. Perhaps the funniest part of the entire movie though is the black pimp guy. Sorry I don't know his name, but you'll know him when you see him. The things he says are just hilarious, and it's no wonder that they keep him around the whole movie, like when a stars officer trys to hand him a gun and opens his jacket to show to custom made golden guns, and he says all his stuff is custom. The movie once again had a very interesting story, and even more action than the first, which will appeal to all of you who liked the fight scenes in the first. The ending though is another cliff-hanger, because it's ending leaves a question that has to be answered.  <br /> <br />Does this mean another RE movie? We can only hope. So if you've seen this in the theatre and liked it, pick it up, the bonuses are worth it. If you've seen the first, but missed the second, pick it up also. And if you don't like Resident Evil at all, then why the hell are you reading this review? Get out of here.
0783231032|5.0|This movie is hilarious.  Steven Spielberg did a GREAT job on this movie.  Its has a wacky and zany plot that keeps you laughing every minute.  If you like comedies, then this is the movie for you.  1941 is a must have.

0060555661|1.0|If you want to read Graham, read the 4th revised edition (1997, 368 pages) in which Graham has expressed his idea very clearly. To me, this edition (2003, 640 pages, with Jason Zweig) adds no value upon the previous one but noise.    And, I suggest you read the review titled \\"Classic book, but annoying commentaries\\" of June 30, 2004.
B000000OQY|5.0|This album is worth it for \\"One in a Million\\" alone, that is one of the greatest G n R songs ever. <br /> <br />its also got \\"Patience\\" \\"Used to Love her\\", \\"Reckless Life\\", \\"Move to the City\\"...........you cant go wrong BUY IT!
0767834739|4.0|First, I haven't picked up the DVD yet so I can't comment on the extras, although from reading the product description, it looks like it's gonna be really cool. I did see it in the theaters twice, so my comments will focus on the movie itself.<br />I was a big fan of the first movie, even though the storyline and the characters didn't have anything to do with the game series. The second one not only has all the elements that made the first one so cool, but now it actually takes place in Raccoon City. So, now you get a real perspective of what the game might actually look like in real life. Nemesis is just bad ass, definitely the coolest part of the movie. Milla Jovovich spent some long hours in the gym, because she is seriously toned. Sienna Guillory (Jill) is real nice on the eyes too, with her hourglass figure and tight fitting clothes. There's more Zombie creatures, too. The dogs are back, and while there was one licker in the first one, now there's a bunch of them. There's a lot more zombie people, too. Of course, also there's Nemesis. The action is pretty awesome too. You know how in the trailer they show Alice running down the side of the building? She also manages to kill four or so guards at the bottom without skipping a beat. There's also more humor in the movie. Mike Epps plays the wisecracking token black guy (as much as I hate stereotypes, that really is his character) and manages to pull off the bulk of the comic relief. I was very pleased with this sequel.<br />Now, I would have loved to give this movie 5 stars but I just couldn't, for 2 reasons. First, I was disappointed to hear that Paul Anderson wouldn't be back in the director's chair for this one. I'm a huge fan of Mortal Kombat and AVP. It was hard for me to picture the movie done by anyone else. Nonetheless, I gave it a good chance. My synopsis is, this director is just not as good. During the fighting scenes, the cameras were shaking like someone was making a home movie. Very annoying. Plus, itwas hard to see the details on the zombies because the cameras were blurred when they were being shown. Not very high quality.<br />Second reason is what happens with Nemesis at the end. Alice has a final fight with him and, well I don't want to give it away but the way they wrote it was very cheesy and sappy.<br />Overall, this one is definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of the games, or a fan of the first movie, or even just a fan of horror/action flicks in general.<br />By the way, there will be a third movie! It's going to be called Resident Evil: Afterlife and prodution is scheduled to start in 2005. I don't know about you guys, but I'm really psyched.
B000000P17|5.0|I will keep this short..........You're not going to find any \\"Paradise City\\" or \\"Sweet Child of Mine\\" on this album (both very over-rated GnR songs),  What you are going to find is some really great covers........yes its all covers, this is not Guns n Roses original music, some people think it is and hate it because it sounds different..........I love it.    You got covers of The Misfits, The Damned, New York Dolls, T-Rex, Dead Boys, Nazareth ect.  HOW CAN YOU GO WRONG???    I guess if you don't like punk rock you probably won't like a lot of stuff on here,  but if you do,  you'll love it. Its great songs re-done by a great band.    This album gets bashed all the time and I don't know why,  most people who bash it have probably never even listened to it.    I can listen to it start to finish every time, and I have worn it out since '94 when I bought it on Cassette.      Point is........don't listen to the \\"Greatest Hits\\" fanboys who knock this album,  its a great collection of covers, and its definetly worth buying,  BUT...if you are a \\"Paradise city\\" ONLY type person then you won't like it.  this is for people who like a little loud dirty rock n roll.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|After I finished the last episode of Firefly, I felt the way I do after I've seen a great movie: I wished I could see the whole thing again for the first time!  Everyone involved was so totally on in this series: director, writers, cast, crew.  It really is excellent.  Like another reviewer said, \\"Don't deprive yourself any longer!\\"
2020418800|5.0|To be honest, I have always liked the beatles music from as far back as I can remember late 60's. Anyway, in the mid. 90's when the anthology cd's came out and was on tv, I bought those and enjoyed them a lot.  I just happened upon this book. I enjoy knowing the history of certain bands, and despite a few people saing you can read or have a hard time reading certain pages - it's not that big of a deal. You do have to take more time and read about 10 to 20 pages. Also how large the book is and how heavy. People will complain about anything. I like hardbound books best so thats what I got. If paperback doesn't bother you get that. One final complaint is that they brag and pat each other on the back - HELLO - I find the Beatles to be very modest considering how their music changed the world. Geat pictures, and great inside stories from the Beatles. Before reading the book I had doubts about reading a book in which the people involved write the book, because an outside view is also very good for certain reasons - I would recommend Shout, and I haven't read The Beatles ten years that changed the world, but the reviews are very good. However, you really need a great book on the Beatles by an outsider, and you need one geat book from the band and thats what you have. If you like the Beatles want to know the history - this is a wonderful book to get.
B00006LLNU|5.0|About half a year ago I finally saw Vanilla Sky on a movie channel and like so many others was given my first taste of Sigur Rós. The 4th untitled track of this album is featured prominently in the final scene of that movie and was immediately gripping for me.    I found myself in tears more because of the song than because of the ending of the movie.  I immediately had to figure out what the song was. I quickly found that it was Sigur Rós, a band I had heard a lot of buzz about but had never gotten around to checking out. I downloaded the track and proceeded to listen to that one song practically non-stop for more than a week, bringing myself to the verge of tears nearly every time. I then went out and bought ( ) so that I could hear the rest of the album. I was not disappointed.    This is some of the most hauntingly beautiful music you will ever hear. It is not traditional in any sense and it can be described as \\"ambient\\", but to me it really is not worth trying to classify.  It doesn't really fit any of the labels people would try to place it under. That's not to say it is completely new and radical, but it is still difficult to classify.    At the time I got the album I was living alone, away from home, for the first time in my life and was fairly depressed. Even though the lyrics are all Icelandic, I could swear I heard \\"You sigh alone.\\" being sung throughout the entire album. It very simply but fairly well summed up how I was feeling at the time. And while that lyric can be seen as very depressing, the beauty of the music really gave me hope. In a strange way, even though it was very slow, \\"sad\\" sounding music, the beauty of it all gave me hope on a level beyond even my personal feelings of depression at that time.    My favorite track off of the album is still 4, I think I'll have a permanent connection to that song, but the rest of the album is equally amazing. Specifically tracks 1, 4, 5, 6 and 8. But even 2, 3 and 7 are great. The album is definitely one that is worth listening to straight through from beginning to end.    This album doesn't seem to be for everyone, although I have to say, I think if this album doesn't connect with you on some level you must be either dead inside or looking for the wrong things.    I later learned through some pretentious indie-dicks that I was not \\"cool\\" because I didn't know of Sigur Rós before Vanilla Sky, and that people who discovered them through Vanilla Sky were just mainstream dolts who don't have a clue.  I honestly couldn't care less. All I care about is that I have this music with me for the rest of my life.
B000002UZ1|5.0|There hasn't been a music group quite like The Beatles. For 8 years the fab four rose up the charts, started Beatle-mania, influenced the way the youth dressed, talked, and grew their hair, and launched a healthy contribution to rock n roll's history. This set of The Beatles greatest hits covers the years of experimentation and progressiveness in lyricism and music, 1967 to the year the band split up, 1970.     The number one single Strawberry Fields Forever/Penny Lane kicks off the compilation. Then, there are four tracks off of 1967's Grammy winning album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, the title track along with Little Help From My Friends, Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds, and A Day In The Life. All You Need Is Love, one of my personal favorites, is also included and it sounds great. Other albums featured are Magical Mystery Tour in four tracks including Fool On The Hill and Hello Goodbye. From 1968's White Album we get Back In The USSR, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, and Obladi Oblada. Abbey Road is represented with Come Together and Here Comes The Sun and from The Beatles final album Let it Be are the title track, Across The Universe and Long And Winding Road. One of the biggest highlights on the album, however, is Hey Jude, the bands biggest selling number one hit single.    For a quick glimpse into The Beatles music and to understand what the big deal was with these four guys from Liverpool, England, this is definitely the album to have. Be sure you get this along with The Beatles 1962-1966.    A
B000068QY7|5.0|After two bad albums Oasis makes a Great one which is as good as Definitely Maybe. The music is great .The lyrics are better than the album before. Liam contributes with 3 awesome songs. What you should now that there is a hidden track on the last song: \\"Better Man\\" called the CAGE which is an intrumental. THIS ALBUM IS MEGA
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|When I was a little kid, I couldn't get this film at all, but when I heard many positive reviews of this film, some saying that it was the best Disney film ever, I decided to give it another shot. So, I bought the DVD, and now, it's starting to grow on me! I now fully agree that this is the best Disney film I've seen! It's no wonder this film won 5 Academy Awards! Songs like \\"Chim Chim Cher-ee\\" \\"Spoonful of Sugar\\" \\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\\" will always get stuck inside your head! <br /> <br />This will always be Julie Andrews best character, no matter how many films she makes. She does a perfect job with Mary Poppins, and yet, she can really sing! No wonder she was that good in Broadway! I believe Walt Disney made a perfect choice to hire Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins!  <br /> <br />Dick Van Dyke ROCKS! He's really funnier than ever, playing as Bert, and yet, he's also a great dancer! I really laughed when he laughs in different stages during the scene with Uncle Albert. Another perfect selection made by Walt Disney! <br /> <br />The Special Effects were PERFECT! I've learned that Cherry Tree Lane was actually in the indoor stage, but I thought at first that it took place in London! It's no doubt the best set I've ever seen. Also, I was really surprised when they wanted this to look like a Broadway stage! I really thought they succeeded in doing that when they were doing the song, \\"Step in Time,\\" which had really perfect energy, and there were no accidents, which really amazed me! I was also impressed that when the Nannies were blew away by a strong wind, and Mary Poppins flying to and from the Banks' house, or all of the Uncle Albert footage, or all the scenes in which they fly, you CAN'T see a SINGLE wire! The fireworks sounds were perfect on the 5.1 mixed edition! I can go on and on, but I'm all out of ideas! <br /> <br />Behind the Scenes and Trailers were a perfect help for the Disc 2 edition. It also has a new short called, \\"The Cat that Looked at the King.\\" While having an okay title, this short was very good. It would be a shame that it would not win an Oscar.  <br /> <br />I give this movie a solid +10/10 <br /> <br />I give this DVD a solid +10/10 for having a perfect video and audio presentations! The video was so enchanting, that I couldn't see a single scratch! The audio was amazing, but I'd stick with the 5.1 mix! <br /> <br />Get this DVD for not only the kids, but for the adults too! <br /> <br />I'm sure that everyone around the world will find this movie and this DVD, \\"SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALIDOCIOUS!!!\\"
B00005JMUL|3.0|What disappointed me about The Polar Express?  Looking forward to this movie--though I've never read the book--I took my 11-year-old nephew Brandon to see it yesterday evening in Times Square.  He liked the movie, and couldn't stop feeling sorry for the Lonely Boy who fell in the snow while rushing to catch the train.<br /><br />My view: the movie is beautifully drawn, and has some touching moments, but I suspect that it'll never make me cry like other do-you-believe-in-Santa movies like Miracle on 34th Street or even The Santa Clause.  In Miracle, the issue wasn't just believing in Santa but in what he stood for: love, faith, generosity, perhaps even justice and mercy.  In Clause, it was family relations.  In contrast, Polar Express' issue seems limited to just believing in Santa Claus, and perhaps in Christmas magic.<br /><br />Also, the characters are ill-motivated.  Yes, Hero Boy, the main character, is doubting the existance of Santa Claus, but why is that a tragedy in itself (as opposed to, say, losing faith in everything, like Doris Walker of Miracle)?  Lonely Boy says \\"Christmas never worked for me?\\" but we don't find out why, and I doubt a large candy-striped package would be enough to make it \\"work\\".  Hmm..maybe it's because Polar Express never challenges commercialism, or society's misuse of Christmas, like the other two movies do.<br /><br />Also, the danger Hero Boy puts himself into just to retrieve Hero Girl's ticket seems uncalled for.  Yes, kids were in danger in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, but there were characters around saying \\"No! Don't!\\"  Maybe Polar Express doesn't have enough character conflict.<br /><br />Or maybe it was too inflated from its storybook beginnings.  Like How the Grinch Stole Christmas, perhaps Polar Express would've worked better as a 30-minute short than as a full-length movie.  Or maybe all the diverse elements: the animated drawings, the expanded plot--just didn't gell well together.<br /><br />Yes, Polar Express is worth watching once or twice, but I doubt I'll fall in love with it., Polar Express is worth watching once or twice, but I doubt I'll fall in love with it. <br />
B000687M48|5.0|This is not just good, this is amazing.. <br />I'm a big evanescence fan and all I can say is that this band is incredible live. <br />you can see the passion, the love.. for all the people who say that they're fake.. and don't think. <br />look at amy while she's playing my immortal at the piano and will understand and she's a good piano player. <br />and please once again, don't say that amy has to lose weight..what the hell do you think? Is it so important? <br />Is it more important than her voice? <br />Althought there is the recorded base under some songs, the band play anyway.. <br />have you heard terry playing? <br />he is just great.. <br /> <br />buy this cd to have great music <br />the dvd is just fan watch the behind the scenes!
B0000E2FLC|5.0|This review will be simple and straight to the point.<br /><br />Call up some friends. Have them come over with beer and whiskey. Turn the stereo up to ten. Rock your flippin' brains out. This DVD performance is great.<br /><br />I was blown away. For close to two hours, AC/DC tore the stage apart. There was no down time. There were no ballads. This was hard rock from opening to closing.<br /><br />The audio is excellent The visuals are also excellent. This concert was well filmed and recorded.<br /><br />\\"Live at Donington\\" sits proudly amongst my collection of live performance DVDs.<br /><br />Rock fans will not be disappointed. Buy this performance.
B00008RV1L|4.0|Perhaps it is my dark humour, but I've always enjoyed this film. Never take it too seriously, however. If you're looking for a dark satire about Wall Street and corporate America in the '80s, you've got it. Plus, Christian Bale is beyond excellent. Rarely have I been disappointed with any of his films.  Reese Witherspoon's character is a bit like her Legally Blonde one later, just slightly less ditzy (and far less pink).<br />Worth at least one watch, but I'd recommend buying it.
B0000TB050|5.0|I like U2 as a band, they've made some fantastic songs, but they've also made a fair amount of mediocre songs as well. Considering their two Best Of compilations, I'm not entirely impressed; in my oppinion, these include too many songs of rarther low quality. But let's get back to this DVD, and why it's different. <br /> <br />I've not experienced U2 live - yet - but this concert showcases them as one hell of a live act! Practically all of the songs are performed excellently here, quite a lot of theme are even superior to the album versions. The set list is great, virtually all the great hits are here - OK not all of them, I know, but should I pick 10 of their best hits, I think all of my choices would be on this setlist, which is of course a great satisfaction. Furthermore, a couple of - two me - less known tracks are included as well, however, none of these are below the standard of the hits. <br /> <br />I'll give a brief overview of the setlist, and my thoughts concerning each one of them. <br /> <br />- Elevation - Great track, and perfect opener of the show. A quite intro, and then the main part of the song brings the show to an explosion-like start. Wonderfull performance of this song, at least as good as the album version, I love the energy of the live take. <br /> <br />- Beautiful Day - A lovely song, and I love the interaction of Bono's and Edge's vocals. This version is a little faster than the album version, which works great, and Bono gives a great vocal performance. <br /> <br />- Until The End Of The World - I didn't know this track before I saw this concert, but it's terrific. This version really rocks; I don't know the album version, but I doubt that it will have as much energy as this version, Edge's guitar play is great, as is Bono's vocals. <br /> <br />- New Years Day - I found the album version of this song quite boring, but to my suprise, this live version is great. It's faster than the original, and Bono and Edge sing really great. Bono wraps himself in the Irish flag on stage, which of course brings great cheers, as the concert is in Dublin. <br /> <br />- Out Of Control - U2's first single, and very funny how Bono presents it as if they were actually a new act, trying to break through. A very good rock song. The interlude is perhaps a little too long, but nevermind. The songs leeds directly into - <br /> <br />- Sunday, Bloody Sunday - Which is my favorite U2 song - and this version is even better than the album version. I just love the drumming on this track, and the guitar part is amazing. This version runs for more than 7 minutes, and Bono gives some really thrilling vocals. <br /> <br />- Wake Up Dead Man - This song is really chilling, with Bono singing with virtually no music. However, it's a great conterpiece to - <br /> <br />- Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Of - Fantastisc singing by Edge and Bono, very impressive performance. <br /> <br />- Kite - Dedicated to Bono's farther, who dies just a week prior to this concert, this song is naturally a very intense moment. The performance is spotless, it's a very beautifull song. <br /> <br />- Angel Of Harlem - and - Desire - are great rockers, quite similar to the album versions, though Desire is unfortunately performed in a rather short edit. <br /> <br />- Staring At The Sun - The rather bleak performance of this song, only played by Edge on guitar and vocals, and Bono on vocals, is perhaps the least good song of this concert, as it is performed here. <br /> <br />- All I Want Is You - dedicated to Bono's wife, this is a beautiful love song. The performance is really great, Bono gives a fantastic vocal performance. <br /> <br />- Where The Streets Have No Name - follows directly after All I Want Is You. I like the transition from one song to the next. This is a spotless performance, it's not my favorite song, but it works well on stage. <br /> <br />[- Mysterious Ways - This song was cut from the main concert for some reason - and is available as a DVD extra. The first part of the performance of this song is perhaps not as good as the album version, but overall I think it's a good performance. Bono's daughter Eve enters the stage, dancing in front of the audience, which is a nice touch.] <br /> <br />- Pride (In The Name Of Love) - Another favorite U2 track, this version is practically as good as the album version - great vocal by Bono. <br /> <br />- Encores: <br /> <br />- Bullet The Blue Sky - Fine rock track - I didn't know this one, but it's a very powerfull performance. <br /> <br />- With Or Without You - One of their best tracks, this is a nice live version, perhaps not as flawless as the album version, but still fine. <br /> <br />- One - Lovely, lovely, one of their strongest tracks as well. Bono's vocal is more rough than the studio version, but it's fine. Nice ending of the track as well. <br /> <br />- Walk On - This track was released as a live single, and I understand why. It's a superb performance, everything just works out perfectly, music, vocals and arrangement. A perfect closer for the show, running for more than 7 minutes in this version. <br /> <br /> <br />All in all, this is a superb concert. The performance and the setlist is great. Essential for fans, and a perfect place to start for newcommers.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|Dawn of the Dead is one of the best horror films ever and it is even better to have the Ultimate Edition of the amazing film out.  I will be reviewing this based on the dvd itself and everything about it. Dawn of the Dead has a great post-Apocolyptic plot on 4 characters who fight there way into survinging a nightmare.  The characters don't really show any compassion but it still doesn't ruin the joy of this amazing film.  It has a great plot, the actors are top notch and the gore effects are absolutley incredible.  This film didn't have very realistic nor very well made zombies but they stillacted and felt like zombies...sort of.   <br /> <br />Now that I got that overwith lemmi get to the dvd itself.  The picture quality is A+, Divimax did an awesome job with everything, the sound, picture quality ect.  The extras in this film are just tons and tons of fun to watch and I won't get into to much detail since you can read the other reviews that tell you about it.  The Ultimate Edition has got to be one of the best DVD sets ever!  It's 4 discs. <br />Disc 1 <br />The thearitical Cut with loads of extras <br />Disc 2 <br />The Extended Cut with loads of extras!! <br />Disc 3 <br />Ugh this one I didn't enjoy...the Dario Argento Cut/European cut if you wanna call it with...yup you guessed it..Loads of extras inculding commentary by all the main actors of this film <br />Disc 4 <br />It's pretty much documents and stuff with Tom Savani and some de tour of the mall with one of the actors(who also plays as Kenens dad in Kenen and Kel) <br /> <br />The Dvd Set is overall A+ and so is the movie.  The movie did change some peoples life when it first hit theaters, It didn't change myn but it sure did make me love zombie films.  It is possibly THE best zombie film ever.  I didn't think the film was overrated at all.  It had great actors, a great plot and great effects by Tom Savani.  The film is also the best in the Dead Trilogy well in my opinion it is.  The zombies in this film are some what cheesy looking but are still a beauty to look at.  They don't look as good or as scary as Luci Fulci's Zombi but still these zombies can BITE!   <br /> <br />Dawn of the Dead had some really great moments like the infamous Zombie buffet scene with the biker gangs and of course some of the more gentle parts of the film like the humor which is very enjoyable and is a shame the Argento cut had most of it taken out so it can be more \\"Serious\\" which is now were I'm going to head my review to... <br /> <br />The Dario Argento cut is just plain awful.  The music is in the most \\"wrong places\\" and the scenes are mixed up in different orders like the infamous buffet scene is now at a different part of the film which kind of got frusraiting for me.  But the Commentary makes up for this mess. <br /> <br />Overall Dawn of the Dead is screaming genious and is overall an incredible horror film and this DVD set makes it even better with tons of extras, great commentary and perfect picture quality, not to mention 3 versions of the film including an extra 4th disc with loads of documents and other extras that'll make you drool for more.  In the end I give this film and DVD set a perfect <br /> <br />5 out of 5 stars. <br /> <br />Well done AnchorBay..well done <br /> <br />Lates
0767834739|3.0|Milla Jovovich's character from the first is back in Resident Evil Apocalypse. The first one ends with her and another survivor being taking in and genitcally altered. Which makes Jovovich a hell of a lot quicker and stronger. The plot in the sequel has her and other survivors stuck in Racoon city with zombies all over the place. A scientist says he can get them out of the city if they find his lost daugher there.<br /><br />  There's tons of action in the movie and Jovovich is in great action form. The movie isn't anywhere near as being a good of a zombie movie as 28 Days Later, Dawn of the Dead or even....Shaun of the Dead. It's still fun though and even better than the first. I think critics such as Ebert & Roeper were way too hard on the movie. It ends making it obvious that a part 3 will be coming soon. Although I liked it, Dawn of the Dead ended making me wanna see more. Resident Evil Apocalypse's ending didn't really make me care whether there's another one or not. Then again part one's ending didn't make me wanna see more either...
B0002WYS6S|5.0|Bought the DVD last night, and its nothing short of brilliant. Sound and picture quality match the abilities of the band. There seems to be a glitch in the mixing 1 hour 30 somthing minutes into the concert, but that hardly warrants removing any stars from the rating. <br /> <br />Some extravagant solos, some tasteful, but others lacking character. Jordan Rudess is amazing though.  <br /> <br />Special features are pretty good. All in all, I would recommend this DVD to anyone who likes DT, heavy metal and or prog.
B00005QK3B|5.0|Reading some of the notes from the other reviewers . It seems that they get that this is a theme album, but miss that this is part of a Trilogy of Albums. Script for a jesters tear, Fugazi and Misplaced Childdhood.They take us from youthful rebellious love, through bitter divorce, and finally to finding our lost youth and moving on with our lives. it is an extraorinary feat to pull this off in three albums while each having their own integrity. Misplaced is the final chapter and has the most pop hooks in it, but it is still a complex and masterful album. The greatest sadness of the CD era is the loss of Mark Wilkinsons stunning cover art, which really loses some of the detail when not on big LP record covers.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|Robert Evans is a moron. Don't listen to his review. He can't even write let alone express his opinion. Anyone who was devastated by the recent political disappointment and need some comic relief should rush to the theatres immediately and see this movie. Months after it's release and following numerous reviews and analysis, the directors' intention was revealed. To enjoy matt stone and trey parkers' humor you must prepare to throw away all morals and inhibitions. Isn't that why movies are made? My hat is off to the most creative team out there
B00003CXCT|3.0|I loved these movies as a kid. I always wondered what the hold up was in getting them out.  I'm not a Star Wars freak.  I don't own any Star Wars toys or whatever so I don't think I fall into the fanatic category, just a lover of the movies, especially in a nostalgic way.  These first three Star Wars films were for me the best Star Wars films.  In fact, the Star Wars films seem to be getting progressively worse.   <br /> <br />The material you're reading here from purists about changes made to the movies has some merit.  The most notable changes are in the Return of the Jedi, which I always thought was the worst of the three anyway.  It suffered from being entirely too corny, and the Ewok characters, for me were totally unbelieveable.  They look like little people in bear suits.  I would have preferred that the filmmakers digitally cover up the seams in the back of the Ewok costumes rather than adding so many things.  In that episode there are noticable changes, the most glaring of which is at the end when you see the \\"ghosts\\" of Obi-Wan, Yoda and Annikan, the Annikan character has been replaced by the kid who played him in Episode 2!  What's with that?!  Yoda didn't have a younger version, Obi-Wan wasn't somehow younger, but Annikan is.  So, don't get me wrong, I don't say this from a purist point of view, but to me that ruins the charm of these movies.  There are numerous other glaring changes.   <br /> <br />Overall, these are the best \\"prints\\" of the moives I've seen.  I only spotted two of those little halos that you used to be able to see around the spaceships.  The picture quality is astoundingly good.  I really wish, however, they would have just made the discs two sided, with the original release on one side and this doctored version on the other. <br /> <br />
B000669GAI|4.0|Okay fans don't shoot me.  I was a fan of Pearl Jam when they first came out with 'Ten' and 'Vs', however, they lost me.  I started finding them pretentious and preachy so I just lost interest.  However, I was interested when I heard they had released a Greatest Hits package.  <BR>First, the positives...every track is a winner (I don't even mind their version of 'Last Kiss' even though i HATED it on the radio).  The album is very reasonably priced and has a s$#t load of music on it.  My only real criticism I have that made me give it four stars instead of five is the overwhelming number of tracks from the first two albums (that anyone even remotely interested in PJ must already own).  I was really hoping for more tracks from their later albums that I am less familiar with.  However, the tracks that are included are wonderful and I probably will get more of their later albums because of them.<BR>New favourite - 'Man of the Hour'.
1592400876|4.0|I enjoyed this book, and came away with an increased awareness of the way that I write in everyday situations.  I find myself catching punctuation errors more often, even (especially!) in the notes coming home from school.  While this is not a primer on puctuation (nor is it, I believe, intended to be), it is useful as a treatise on the importance of our communication in whatever form it may take.  Even if it is an online review.
B0000AR8NK|2.0|Being a huge fan of Bowie, I was looking so forward to his follow up to Heathen which was such a classic Bowie album.  However, I was and continue to be disappointed by this album.  <BR>It starts off well with the track 'New Killer Star' but even that song wears thin with it's insipid &quot;ready set go&quot; and wimpy chorus.  The songs are very ordinary (which Bowie can do well - see 'Hours') and boring but with some bright spots.  Bowie's version of 'Pablo Picasso' is an artsy rocker in the vein of 'Heathen's' 'Cactus', 'Fall Dog Bombs the Moon' is good and the lounge lizard tune 'Bring Me The Disco King' is interesting but otherwise a bit of a blip in Bowie's catalogue as far as I am concerned.  Still love ya' though God - oops I mean David.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I was a minimal Green Day before this album.  I had the greatest hits and Warning, and although I enjoyed those songs immensely, nothing got me hooked like AI.  Sure, Dookie may have the classic singles, but once you take away those, the album does not hold up to what AI features.  The songs are truly a master of craft.  I'm so scared for Green Day now.  I just don't see them coming out with something better than this.  They rose the bar too high.  While the other albums feature good melodies, all the songs are so basic when compared to this album.   <br /> <br />\\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" \\"Holiday\\" \\"Boulevard\\" \\"St. Jimmy\\" \\"Wake me up\\", etc, the classics just keep coming one after the other.  I'd say the only \\"weak\\" track is the headlining single \\"American Idiot.\\"  It's a little bit too cliche and bland when compared to the rest of the album.  I don't think people give this album a fair assessment by only hearing the single.  The rest of the tracks feature so much more depth and detail. <br /> <br />Get this album.  Album of the year.  One of the best albums I've ever bought.
B00008OLYN|5.0|A wonderful mellow CD. This is Opeth's expermiental CD and I must say that I am impressed. The CD is softer than their usual songs. Many Opeth songs either start out with death metal taste and move into softer melodic moods, or start out songs soft and then turn into harder songs. However, this CD is mellow. I think it is wonderful to listen to when pondering things or if you just feel like chilling and listening to something soft. The band did a fantastic job of playing the instruments in wonderful ways that make the music flow smoothly and keep you interested. Though everyone has a different opinion, this CD felt somewhat comforting and mentally soothing to me. I highly recomend it to all but make sure to sample songs but be warned Opeth is known for having long songs so 30 seconds is not enough time to really appreciate the music.
B0006A9FKA|2.0|This movie is the most overrated peice of british cinema that i have ever seen.  The movie has no flow at all, it intertwines extreme dramatic scenes and scary ones with dead pan british humor scenes. The characters are completely different people from one scent to the next.  Don't waste your time with it.
B00005JMXX|1.0|Wow. This movie was really, really awful. The story line is of course ludicrous, but even if you are able to completely suspend reality, it still is just a terribly put-together movie. The effects are hideous (what's with all the weird 'freezing' that happened to already solid objects as they..um..froze more, I guess?) and the entire direction was comical. The actors do a reasonable job, but the movie is so over-the-top bad that nothing can salvage it from the B-Movie status that it should have. It made independence day look like art. Save your money, save yourselves, and do something more worthwhile with your couple of hours like watching paint dry.
B000096I9G|5.0|This is one of the best Cure dvd's around, I will say that the interviews were a bit.....bland, having said that I would like to continue with praise. This collection really has three of THE best CD's that the band has made, performed live, and very well. The sound is great, you almost feel as though you are actually in the front row while watching it. The picture is also very nice, as I said before, the interviews felt as though they were missing something,  however, they are still worth watching. I recommend the Cure Trilogy to any cure fan, I can say with confidence that you will not be disappointed.
B00005JN0T|3.0|Not a bad movie, but not great either. Will Smith is decent as always. Asimov's storyline is interesting and the effects are good as well. It's a good, entertaining couple of hours that's worth renting; but not a memorable film that's worth owning unless you're a huge Smith fan or fan of this genre.
B000002I2M|5.0|This album is cooler than the band.  <br /> <br />One mark of a good album is whether you have ever heard anything like it before or since. This is one of those albums. Although derivative in nature, it has a unique sense to it.  <br /> <br />It is a strange mixture of dreamy laments like Hyancinth House mixed in with raspy blues numbers like Changeling and Crawling King Snake.  <br /> <br />Sometimes I go for years without listening to this album but always return to it. It is timeless.
B0002O06N0|4.0|Great dirty blues in an urban-delta tradition. This duo from Ohio have found the perfect home for their sound in the Fat Possum family. Dan Auerbach, vocals/guitar, has a greg allmanish whiskey raw voice along with commanding garage-slide skills, while Patrick Carney, drums, plays with a southern style of listlessness that is anything but. Rubber factory is a great start as is Thickfreakness. If you are into blues or garage then you'll be extremely happy with this group

B0002IVN9W|5.0|I'm not going to say this is some super special masterpiece, but it is definately a whole lot better than anything else released this year and it's not even on the radio. If you like music like modest mouse, interpol, bjork, radiohead, new order and u2 you'll easily appreciate this. You can really hear bits of those bands in amazon's samples. You don't have to listen to the hype or the naysayers. You can just hear the clips and know that this is something special. The clips, however, really don't do the album justice, so here are some things you should know. <br /> <br />First of all, the lyrics to this album are amazing. They are very sentimental and come off as things remembered or the fear and realization of becoming an adult. For those of you who like to find soundtracks to your life (whatever), this is probably exactly what you've been looking for. <br /> <br />Another thing is the last track. There wasn't a sound clip so I thought I'd describe it a bit. The vocals on it clearly sound bjork-like. The song even sounds a bit like her non-trip hop, house stuff. It's got an airy piano, building drums and of course strings. The music also has that popular repetitive \\"strokin'\\" of the guitar that bands like interpol love to do nowadays-- not that there's anything wrong with that. Anyway, it's a great song on a great album.
B00004XONN|5.0|While the last reviewer, Mike Young, makes some valid general points about &quot;counter-establishment&quot; passing for good music, none of that applies to this CD...  By rating it on &quot;listenability&quot;, he misses the point of creative artistic expression and evolution...<BR> <BR>Mike I suggest you be more open to music in all its forms, even difficult ones like &quot;Kid A&quot;.  Mining those depths can be very rewarding, even if not quite your cup o' tea.<br />Cheers
B00005JMJG|5.0|This is a bold film with tons of style.  But somehow the director gets a 'real' performance out of Jim Carrey.  It's a mind bending experience, but touching at the same time.
B0000CBHOI|5.0|Seven discs were not enough.  Martin Scorsese did a magnificent job.  Having been a big blues fan for many years, studied music and also played music for many years, I wish this information had been available to me when I was growing up.  Some of them I knew by name and music but not the face.  It was great to be able to put a name to the faces.  My girlfriend was amazed to hear music that she thought was original music by other artists, ie Rock N Roll types.  Also, a lot of people were not aware of Clint Eastwoods involvement with the blues and his talents as well. <br />  The only down side was the fifth disc, the Marc Levin film.  I admit, I am by no means a fan of hip-hop.  It's not, in my opinion, music.  They have no talent of their own so they use other people's music.  And it was a shame that Chuck D and his cronies, Common and Kyle Jason couldn't manage to get throuh the movie without the over excessive use of the \\"F\\" word.  It truly showed how ignorant they are that they couldn't carry on an intelegent conversation without it.  The only disc out of 7, very sad.  It was also obvious that he didn't have a clue of what he was talking about most of the time.  It truly detracted from the movie to the point that you just couldn't ignore it, but when your music has that garbage in the lyrics, I guess you have to talk that way too.  You didn't hear the old guys using it, except for Chess, who would have been very impressive otherwise.  Otherwise, the \\"blues\\" information given was very interesting and informative.  Some really good footage, Koko, Wolf, and some good blues music.  I just hope that the blues and hip-hop mix doesn't catch on. <br />  I am sure that there must be much more that found it's way to the cutting room floor that could be compliated into another set.  There are so many other blues artists that should have been mentioned, there must be another one in the works.
B000244FDW|5.0|... that so many reviewers would choose to compare the two BBC versions of Jane Austen's masterwork--such an embarrassment of riches. Mightn't it be better to take each of them on its own terms, and then have twice the pleasure? <br /> <br />I liked this 1980 version because Fay Weldon's script retained so much of Austen's inner narrative, which forms the heart/soul of the novel.
B000069HPL|5.0|I watched this movie for the first time back when I was in college.  It was a great flick at the time, funny and quirky with terrific characters.  It was only after I graduated and joined the world of the cube-dwellers that I truly began to appreciate the movie for all it is worth. <br /> <br />Everyone who watches it finds some way to identify with it (just read every other review here on Amazon that quotes the movie).  Mike Judge has done a great job capturing every day life in the Cube Kingdom.  In doing so, he has also created one of the funniest movies of the last 20 years. <br /> <br />\\"Office Space\\" should be required viewing for every new mid-level manager and business school undergrad. <br /> <br />Buy it, watch it, and hope and pray that your job is nothing like that of Peter Gibbons and the fine people at Initech.
0812524586|5.0|This is easily Orson Scott Card's finest work. It deserves to be rated as one of the top handful of pure sci-fi novels ever, along with Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land, Clarke's Rendezvous with Rama and 2001, and Asimov's Foundation. <br />Ender's Game has a great plot and great sci-fi devices. This is classic techno, futuristic sci-fi with space-faring, and a space war. The plot of the war is all too believable and the twist at the end will stop you in your tracks. The main characters are all children and Card does a great job writing their characters and showing you their growth as they age. <br />The only possible drawback anyone might find in this book is in the outcome of the war. Some readers could very easily find that outcome too morally and ethically disturbing and criticize the book on that basis. But clearly moral and ethical outrage had to be Card's intent and he goes on to explore the consequences for the characters and the rest of humanity in the sequels. <br />If you've ever read and enjoyed sci-fi and not yet read this, it's a must-read and should be next on your list.
B00005LOUP|5.0|Jim Carrey does a remarkable job as the Grinch.  The movie has some great visual effects.  The plot wasn't great but for this kind of a movie when you have so little and have to make it into a film, it worked perfectly.  This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen and I highly recommend it.
B000001DTM|3.0|I've been sitting here reading people's thoughts about U2 albums, many having listened to their 80's classics for the first time - as a big U2 fan this was quite enjoyable. During this, I must say I discovered that according to many this is one of their standout albums. While I must admit the songwriting on this album is strong per se, I cannot see this as one of their better efforts overall, though it is not as bad as Rattle & Hum or Pop (or All That You Can't Leave Behind, for that matter.) <br /> <br />This album, to my understanding, begins a period of descent for U2 into the dark side of life. Bono has lost his high-minded spirituality and the band is seen in their videos crossdressing and wandering the streets. While we can all see now (in 2004) that for the most part the band has emerged from this period unscathed, nonetheless songs like \\"the Fly\\" are no picnic. A mild hit on alt-rock radio for a few months, one listen to the Edge's guitar work on this track conveys clearly the gloom that the lyrics elaborate. <br /> <br />One needn't delve that deeply to discover the depressed mood of this disc, though. If it isn't the the devilish glare of Bono on the cover it's the introduction of the \\"Zoo\\" metaphor to U2 fans on track one, signaling a radical change of direction for U2 in the Achtung Baby/Zooropa/Pop period. As an aside, though most would probably agree their last two albums (\\"All That ...\\" & \\"Bomb\\") are a return to their more familiar optimistic tone, IMHO \\"A Man & A Woman\\" is a sign Bono is still wrestling with some serious issues of love & trust. <br /> <br />Which of course raises the question, \\"How can your favorite U2 disc end with an anthem of utter hopelessness like 'Love Is Blindness'\\"? Besides disagreeing with the implication, this is not the heroic U2 I learned to love over a decade. <br /> <br />I did mention the songwriting was strong on this album, I mean that in a technical sense - to my taste Zooropa is a far stronger album creatively & imaginatively, the most satisfying of this period. (Pop is an album I originally did not consider worthy of U2, though I'll probably be giving it another listen soon.) <br /> <br />The best song on the album for me is a tossup between \\"One\\" and \\"Mysterious Ways\\" - both welcome additions to the U2 songbook. While it doesn't quite rock, \\"Ultraviolet\\" is infectious and an easy listen. Unfortunately, that's about it for this album.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|I knew what to expect when I rented this movie.  The synopsis on the back of the box spelled out most of the story, even the parts one had to read-into.  But what I found pleasant about this film is the unexpected turns and twist, such as Tom Cruise's character's first HIT falling four stories onto the cab he was using.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx plays cabbie Max, a man with big dreams and a lot of common sense.  He finds himself in quite a bind after Tom Cruise's character, hitman Vincent, forces him to drive him to all of his scheduled assassinations.<br /><br />Yes, some of this movie is predictable, but a there are also a few twist and turns that make the movie more enjoyable.  The actual activities and routes the charaters perform are believable, parts of the dialogue are NOT.  When Jamie Foxx calls to warn a woman that Vincent is on the way to kill her, the woman keeps saying, \\"I don't understand.  What are you saying.\\" That was totally unbelievable.  I think there should have been a little more thought put into the dialogue of this film.  Too much hype and spice was thrown into the mix.  The action was good enough that Mann could have relied on more believable dialogue to keep the film flow seem more even.<br /><br />All and all, this is a good movie.  I think most people will enjoy the entertainmnet.  Warning to those with children (and us adults that are sick of hearing the F-word all the time), there is a lot of cussing in this movie...ummm...and...violence. :-)<br /><br />See ya next review.
B0001MDP3G|1.0|Nicole Kidman and Jude Law fall in love (apparently, quickly, and without me noticing). Jude Law goes to war and they spend the rest of the movie trying to get back together - 2 and a half hours later.<br />What is good about the movie? Cinematically it is excellent and the acting - especially the minor parts - is excellent. Remove Philip Seymour Hoffman, Donald Sutherland, Nathalie Portman etc. out of the movie and you might actually have a better film. The reason for this is that the only reason to keep some scenes in the movie is because of the performances therein. <br />Take out the short set-up to the movie and the short reunion at the end, and all you have in between is scene after scene of how nasty the 'deserter hunters' are and how sordid and deperate people became at the end of the war. You could take an hour out of this film and still not lose the story - what little of it there is.<br />Let me ruin the movie for you. In the end the bad guys get what's comin' and the two lovers get back together. That's about as deep as an episode of 'Dukes of Hazard' with the same accents.
B00005JN4O|5.0|It's December 2004. Forget the usual spate of tired, formulaic \\"holiday\\" pictures (the dreadful \\"Christmas with the Kranks,\\" for example). Far more appropriate for the season is this sweet fact-based tale of playwright James Barrie (Johnny Depp) and his relationship with an attractive widow, Sylvia Llewelyn-Davies (Kate Winslet), and her sons--a friendship that inspired his classic play \\"Peter Pan.\\" Foremost among the film's many virtues are the easy and unself-conscious way it slips between fantasy and reality, and its refusal to divide the players into facile heroes and villains. Barrie, played to perfection by Depp, is an enchanting figure to the Llewelyn-Davies boys, but also an impractical dreamer and negligent husband. Nor is all sweetness and light among the family he befriends: Peter (Freddie Highmore), the most sensitive of the boys, and Sylvia's mother Emma (Julie Christie, whose screen appearances these days are infrequent, but always welcome) in particular are wary, at times hostile. The gossip and disapproval that the playwright's unusual relationship with the family aroused are acknowledged as well. The vividness of the characters is due in equal parts to the literate, thoughtful screenplay and the almost uniformly superb quality of the acting. Only Dustin Hoffman seems a bit out of place as Barrie's blustering producer. Even in a winter season rich with films where dialogue and characterization come to the fore (\\"Sideways,\\" \\"Closer\\"), \\"Finding Neverland\\" stands out.
0060528737|5.0|I was first hooked on this series, when one of my friends told me to read Sabriel (1st book), because it was an awesome book. I was a bit skeptical at first, since I don't usually read fantasy, but once I began the book, I couldn't put it down. After Sabriel, I read Lirael (2nd book) and it was just as great and even more creative! In Abhorsen, I was amazed! I am the kind of reader who gets easily caught up in the book, so for the moment while I was reading, I was anxious for Lirael, Dog, Mogget and Sam while they sought to fufill their mission. There are a many surprises in this book, so if you have already read the other, don't hesitate to pick this one up! If you are as skeptical as I was about starting this trilogy, don't be. Just read this book, you will not be disappointed!
0440236738|3.0|after reading a bunch of great reviews on this book, i was dying to read it.  <br /> <br />when i did i felt two ways: confused at points and a little disappointed.  while i liked the book's plot(s), i just couldn't become emotionally attached to the characters -- character development just did not seem to be a priority in this book.  since i didn't care for any of the characters (as i did not really feel that i \\"knew\\" them) so many of them blurred together at certain points of the book.  this led me to become confused sometimes.  one bad guy seemed just to blur into the next.  this did frustrate me at one scene to the point of not wanting to continue reading.  but i kept going and was surprised at an ending that i did not expect.  not to ruin it for anyone, but the ending for me was a bit of a stretch.  <br /> <br />the main thing i did like about this story was really the mental arguments the main character had with himself.  often, i found him asking the silly or mundane questions regular people ask/say when watching a suspense or horror flick.  <br /> <br />overall, it was an entertaining read, but no.thing extraordinary
6305971145|5.0|i recently saw this over the holidays for the very first time and i really fell in love with it. very charming. david huddleson is *perfect* as santa! i'm going to order this and watch every christmas!
B000067CPX|5.0|The red hot chili peppers never lost thye talent that they clearly always had. This album shows some maturity and they need to add a little more funk 2 it. The first time i bought this album i didnt listen 2 it but then, 2 years later on my way to france i picked it up and couldnt stop listening to it. There isn t a song on the Cd that i dont love and every song is a winner. Great cd 92%. <br />           I cant wait for their next album and their next concert.    <br /> <br />This is by no means their BEST album, If you really want to get into the red hot chili peppers then you should buy their BEST album \\"Californication\\" or their 2nd best \\"Blood sugar sex magik.\\" <br />
B0002XVQNU|5.0|saw the director's cut of this on recently and was really entertained! much better than the version that came out first (although that was fairly entertaining). i'm definitely ordering the director's cut to watch again and again. it's great!
044024157X|4.0|Grisham returns to Clanton, Mississippi, home of his previous novels \\"A Time to Kill\\" and \\"The Summons\\", with a story that starts out without the lawyers, but quickly falls back into the popular formula, even bringing back the character of Harry Rex Vonner, who stole the show in \\"The Summons\\".<br /><br />The central character this time (Willie Traynor) is again a young, white male, lazy on the educational side and looking for an easy way through life.  Only this time, he's not a lawyer dabbling in torts (as per \\"The King of Torts\\"), but a journalist who takes over a newspaper in Clanton in the seventies.  He's got cheap accommodation, a couple of local characters to help him along, a rich relative, and lots and lots of good luck, all of which combine to make him a success story.<br /><br />The brutal rape and murder of a local woman sells a lot of newspapers, and his fearless coverage of the case and subsequent trial make him a lot of friends, but also some deadly enemies, particularly the secretive underworld bootlegging family of the accused killer Danny Padgitt.<br /><br />It's a pleasant enough story about the affairs of a small town and the running of a small newspaper, and covers cook-outs, drinking, families, obituaries, Sunday sermons, poker, cornbread and chitlins, as well as racism and the closing of small businesses by the wheels of progress, but it's when the lawyers and legal system are called into action that things get ugly.<br /><br />The plot thins towards the end, when people who served on the jury for the murder case start getting killed, and everybody keeps barking up a convenient tree when their reason for doing so makes no sense whatsoever.<br /><br />The ending is somewhat anticlimactic, with hints being thrown here and there in earlier chapters, and Grisham again wraps it up as quickly as possible.<br /><br />All things considered though, it's a good read, and one of his better ones in recent times.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, December 30, 2004
0312983867|4.0|I first read Janet Evanovich's Hard Eight in hardback, and then recently listened to the unabridged audio version on tape.  This book made a long and tedious car trip much more enjoyable.<br /><br />At the beginning of Hard Eight, Stephanie Plum's world is pretty normal for her.  She shares an apartment with her hamster, mooches meals off her folks, hasn't had a date in months, is still torn between Ranger and Morelli, and keeps a gun in her cookie jar (with no bullets).  Things quickly change when a neighbor asks for some help.  The neighbor put her house up for a child custody bond, and is in danger of losing her house when her daughter and granddaughter disappear.  Stephanie agrees to \\"look into it,\\" but when Plum is around, you can be sure it won't be done with discreteness.  In fact, she uses the stumble-bumble method of investigation.<br /><br />Stephanie soon finds herself in a mystery that is more complicated than a simple missing persons case.  She also finds herself up against a number of bad guys including a psychopathic war-gamer and four men in costumes (a bunny, a bear, Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon).  As the case unfolds, it is difficult to estimate whether Plum loses more handcuffs, cell phones, vehicles or FTA's (failures to appear).  Dead bodies also turn up all over Trenton including one on her living room couch.  Evanovich's observations about Trenton and New Jersey are a scream and the plot will have you laughing out loud.<br /><br />My one complaint about the audio version is that the reader, Lorelei King, has perfect diction.  People from New Jersey (and especially Trenton) don't have perfect diction. It hurts my ears to hear Trenton pronounced with two \\"t's\\" (it should be pronounced Tren-un) and Mazur butchered in every book recorded so far.  Mazur has a long \\"a\\" with the accent on the first syllable.  There have been numerous readers for the Evanovich series, and each one has pronounced it differently and each one was wrong.  Just once, it would be nice for a reader to consult with the author for correct pronunciations.<br /><br />But despite this, Hard Eight is a fun book.  Some books have been stronger than others, and this is one of the better ones.  Let's hope Evanovich still has some tricks up her sleeve.e, it would be nice for a reader to consult with the author for correct pronunciations.   <br /> <br />But despite this, Hard Eight is a fun book.

B000059Z8J|5.0|Released in 1978, Superman would be the first big buget Hollywood treatment of Superheroes and thus is historically a very important film as it showed studios just how big movies like this could be.  Directed by Richard Donner the movie covers the origins of Superman from the destruction of his planet of krypton to being sent away prior to its destruction to Earth where he would be found by Mr. and Mrs Kent and raised as their own son, Clark.<br /><br />We see Clark as a young man coming to grips with his power, even showing off by racing a train.  With the death of his father (Glen Ford) we cut to an adult Clark going to Metropolis and getting a job with the Daily Planet and meeting Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) Perry White (Jackie Cooper) and eventually his arch-nemesis, lex Luthor (Gene Hackman).<br /><br />Long before the days of computer generated special effects, the geniuses behind Superman really did make us believe a man could fly.  His first appearance as Superman where he catches Lois Lane as she plummets to certain doom, and then catches the crashed helicopter still give me chills when I watch it.<br /><br />Of course the thing that most of us will remember about Superman is its star, the late Christopher Reeve.  The man truly embodied what Superman was.  His fantastic portrayal of the geeky, fumbling Clark contrasted perfectly with his powerful and definitive portrayal as the Man of Steel.<br /><br />Gene Hackman was comically evil as Lex Luthor and was joined by co-horts Ned beatty and Valerie perrine as the film's eye candy.<br /><br />Mario Puzo, known for his best work in the original story of The Godfather, put together a wonderful researched story staying true to the classic comic.  This special edition contains several added scenes not in the original theatrical release featuring several more scenes on Krypton invloving Brando.  The main things about this great DVD are the 3 documentaries hosted by Marc McLure who played Jimmy Olsen in the movies.  They give a fascinating look behind the making of these movies and the problems of casting and pulling off the special effects that they faced.  Also great is the screen tests which feature some of the other actresses who were considered for the part of Lois Lane and a great commentary track by Richard Donner.<br /><br />Really a wonderful and valuable DVD.

B0006399FS|5.0|U2 departed from what made them great in the mid to late 90's.  Thank god they came back to it.  This album is top notch.  It's amazing that a band can be around 25 years and turn out such great hits at this stage in their career.  Remember, the Beatles were only around 7 years.
B00005LQ04|5.0|\\"Suspiria\\" is one of those special films that still holds up after it was made because it's so ahead of its time. The rich, saturated color... The extremely unique musical score... The hard start, slow middle, and hard end... These are all testaments to the absolute genius of Dario Argento. The tag line attached to the film (\\"The only thing more terrifying than the last 12 minutes of this film are the first 92.\\") is very misleading, but that's the beauty of it. For the first 15 minutes of it, you're treated to alternating scenes of the lead character arriving at the airport and a double murder, both filmed in rich, vibrant color, then the film kicks into a slow buildup leading to a heavy climax. It's a true exercise in patience paying off in spades. Dario Argento is a true genius in every sense of the word. And this film has secured his legacy for all time.
B00003CX95|5.0|I still recall seeing this movie in the theater for the first time. I was immediately struck by two things--the dirt and grit that encrusted the actors and the gloriously beautiful music. It was also one of the few films that had me openly in tears at the end. This was especially odd considering I was a jaded 24 year old at the time on a first date with a young lady who was not similarly affected.<br /><br />Braveheart is one of those rare movies that I can watch over and over again and find something new and compelling every single time. The writing is brilliant. The acting is simply magnificent--every character is memorable. The sets were lush and gorgeous. The battle scenes hit you like a punch in the face. The film deserved every award it was given--and then some.<br /><br />As for the DVD, it is a \\"must have\\" for anyone who loves action/adventure movies, is a Mel Gibson fan, or wants a taste of what life was like in the Middle Ages. Be aware, however, that the plot is not straight history--nor is it meant to be. Little is known about the real William Wallace and the author of Braveheart, Randall Wallace, fleshed out the character and added many plot elements that are not found in the historical record. The extras provided with the DVD are well-done and interesting. I enjoyed Gibson's commentary.<br /><br />The overall theme of Braveheart is compelling and challenging to us cozy moderns who are often quite willing to exchange our God-given freedoms for financial security. It is helpful to remember that there were times when men were willing to risk everything to throw off the shackles of despotism.
B00005JMX6|2.0|Elisha Cuthbert's sweetly sexy presence can't save this half-baked, confused teen sex comedy. <br /> <br />At it's heart, \\"Girl Next Door\\" wants to be a sort of \\"Risky Business\\" for the 21st Century.  But it lacks the intelligence and edginess of that film and the magnetism of a Tom Cruise in the lead role. <br /> <br />I have to give props to Cuthbert, who is of course best known for playing Kim, the daughter of the hero of TV's \\"24\\"(Keifer Sutherland as Jack Bauer).  I suspect her picking this part had more to do with showing she could act outside the confines of her good girl image than any love of the storyline.  Here she plays a 19-year old porn star with a heart of gold who wants to leave her past behind.  <br /> <br />But she's ultimately hampered by the weak script which can't decide if it wants to be a sex farce, a morality tale, or a straight romance.  Emile Hirsch, the neigbhor boy who falls in love with her at first sight lacks the gravity needed to serve as a convincing co-star. <br /> <br />Furthermore, the movie's conclusion is just too unbelievable.  Granted the movie is basically structured as a wish fulfillment fantasy for horny teenage boys but this climax comes off as too neat, too tidy, and ultimately fake. <br /> <br />If there's any reason to see this movie it's, believe it or not, not Cuthbert but Timothy Olyphant who nearly steals the movie as an oily, venomous porn flick producer.  Olyphant commands every scene that he's in and his wisecracks elicit the film's only genuine belly laughs. <br /> <br />Other than that and a few nice shots of the gorgeous Cuthbert this is one Girl Next Door you should avoid visiting. <br /> <br />
B00005JMYI|4.0|I hadn't expected much from Anchorman, but prepare to be pleasently surprised at just how funny the film is.  Will Ferrell is deadpan as Ron Burgundy, a TV newscaster on top of the world with his news team (including Paul Rudd, David Koechner, and the Daily Show's Steve Carell), and soon finds himself at odds with a tenacious female newscaster (Christina Applegate) who is looking to make it big, even if it comes at Ron's expense.  While some of the gags fall flat at times, the film for the most part is a joy, and the viewer is able to tell that the cast is having great fun which makes this even more enjoyable.  Anchorman for the most part is a surprisingly funny mainstream flick that fans of Ferrell will no doubt enjoy, and cameo roles from Vince Vaughn, Tim Robbins, Jack Black, Luke Wilson, and Ben Stiller will have you grinning from ear to ear.
0743454529|5.0|I think this book is one of the best books I have ever read.  I laughed, got mad, cried...you name it, it touched all of my emotions.  I checked it out of the library but will be buying my own copy to keep!  The last book I read of Jodi Picoult's wasn't very good so I went into My Sister's Keeper wondering if I would feel the same way...boy was I wrong!  I was deeply touched by all the characters, and like the way that the story was told from their different points of view.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
0312263120|1.0|First off, I loved A & D and liked DVC.  Second, I am a computer programmer with experience in cryptography.  So this book really hurt me. <br /> <br />This book is painful to read.  Most of the facts, much of which are crucial to the plot, are just flat out wrong.  Dan Brown does not know very much about computers, cryptography, guns, or intelligence work, and it shows.  His research was pathetic.  This alone will turn off many technically-savvy folks. <br /> <br />Aside from that, the plot, while containing a few surprises, has very predictable twists, and any intelligent person could chart out the whole plot after about 30 pages.  Even still, the pacing makes for interest, until the end.  The climax was one of the worst I have ever read in any techno-thriller novel, and that is saying a lot considering how crowded this field became after Tom Clancy made it big.  At best, only a cheesy early 80s movie would try to bring the final scene to celluloid (think \\"Wargames\\", but dumber).  It's like a comic book. <br /> <br />If the gentle reader of this review is really interested in a good techno-thriller involving computers and cryptography, read \\"Cryptonomicon\\" by Neal Stephenson.  He is a real live programmer and cryptographer, and also a fine writer.
B00005JNEI|2.0|By now Michael Moore is a true love-him-or-hate-him guy, another face that can ignite rage in some people and smug smiles in others.<br /><br />I liked Roger & Me, back in 1988 when he could get away with making that film and not get noticed by too many people.  I thought Bowling for Columbine was interesting--at least someone was trying to make a film you could think about, bias or no bias.  There've been shouting matches over whether or not this film is a 'documentary', which should tell you something.  Some dismiss it as 'propaganda', others think it's the 'Truth'.<br /><br />My problem with this movie is not the anti-Bush stance, or the questions asked, it's the fact that I can't figure out what the film is about.  This film has no thesis, it hardly has a point to make.  It seems like a long rant about the last four years, starting of course, with more moaning about the 2000 election, suggesting that life would be just rosy if we'd elected the other candidate of the big business party.<br /><br />Give me a break.  As a documentary, the film is not very good.  As a Moore heart-tugger and audience-reaction-getter, it can be effective.  I don't think you'll learn anything from this movie.  It will either reinforce your views, or give you a fit.  What are you supposed to do with this movie?  Picket the White House?  Moore has all of the resources and by now the money to make a good documentary, but instead he wastes our time with a movie designed to get people NOT to vote for Bush, so you can see how much documentary integrity he cares about.<br /><br />I like some of Moore's work, including his TV show The Awful Truth, which pointed a funny bone at some issues (the guy dressed as Hitler going to Swiss banks, or 'Corporate COPS'.)  Yes, Bush is a mistake, the war is wrong, but Moore is not the answer.  I'm betting he still has the ability to make food for thought, but you won't find it here or on the 18 billion extras on the DVD, like Bowling for Columbine, which was filled with so much extra 'Moore' that I sold the thing on eBay.oore' that I sold the thing on eBay.
B000004286|5.0|I purchased this soundtrack soon after it was released and it quickly became a regular in the rotation. The music is haunting and lovely. In the director's commentary on the DVD of Braveheart, Mel Gibson explains that the pipes used for the soundtrack were actually Irish, not Scottish, because the Irish pipes have a more melodious tone--not as harsh and shrill as Scottish bagpipes can sometimes sound.<br /><br />This wonderful score helped make Braveheart the brilliant movie that it is. The fact that the music has been used time and again in various advertisements confirms its power and majesty. Every time I play this CD, I have a hankering to re-watch the film. Therefore, if you purchase this disc, it might also be a good idea to get the DVD--which sells for a good price right here on Amazon.com.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|Let's get right to the question everyone contemplating buying this pricey four disc set is no doubt asking themselves:  \\"Should I spend the money to buy this movie again?!?!\\"    The answer:  \\"Yes you should!!!!\\"    I say this because, the typical fan of the original \\"Dawn Of The Dead\\" probably already owns at least one copy of this movie and possibly more than that.  If, like me, you're an older fan who was lucky enough to see it in theaters upon its release you may even have one of the ancient HBO Video VHS versions tucked away somewhere.    Since then the film has been released and re-released in various versions on VHS, Laser Disc, and DVD countless times. Many die-hard fans have probably bought multiple incarnations of \\"Dawn\\" over the years for new documentaries here or new commentaries there.      Get ready to open your wallet again because, cost consciousness aside, this \\"Ultimate Edition\\" falls squarely into the \\"must buy\\" column.    If you've never seen the original \\"Dawn\\", let's begin with a synopsis.  In 1978, George Romero released the second film in what would later come to be called the \\"Dead Trilogy.\\" \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" isn't a sequel to \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" as much as it is another view of world being overrun by flesh-eating, reanimated corpses.    While \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" ended bleakly it also suggested that humans were successfully repelling the zombie onslaught. \\"Dawn\\" opens with the zombies clearly gaining the upper hand.     Two Philadelphia Police SWAT Team members, a female television news producer, and the station's news chopper pilot steal a helicopter and flee the city. They seek a brief respite by landing atop a rural indoor shopping mall that, like everywhere else, is thick with zombies.    The SWAT officers quickly devise a \\"hit and run\\" plan to loot needed supplies while eluding the walking dead. When that plan succeeds with only minor hitches, the band decides to extend their stay. What follows is a series of brilliantly executed action sequences wherein the four use cleverness and weapons looted from the mall's gun shop to eliminate the zombies and take control of the mall.    As a straight horror film, \\"Dawn\\" doesn't quite work. Part of the problem lies in the film's setting. A brightly-lit shopping mall doesn't evoke the same sense of terror and dread as the night-time rural farm house setting of \\"Night of the Living Dead.\\" Nevertheless, the film fires on all cylinders as action-adventure piece that never relents.     Key to its success is strong performances by the quartet of then-unknown actors in the leads. Especially notable are Gaylen Ross as Francine and Ken Foree as SWAT officer Peter. Foree's role is especially significant since it marks the second time in the \\"Dead\\" series that Romero cast an African-American in a strong lead role.    Foree's Peter quickly establishes himself, and is accepted, as the leader of the group. When one considers that this was more than 10 years before Will Smith proved audiences would line up to see a Black man save the world in \\"Independence Day\\", you realize that this was a pretty revolutionary move for Romero to take in 1978.    In terms of onscreen violence and gore the film set a new benchmark.  One could argue that if \\"Night\\" pushed the envelope in this regard, \\"Dawn\\" shredded it and then set the pieces on fire.    At the time of its release it was left un-rated due to its excessive violence and gore. Starlog Magazine described it as \\"quite possibly the most violent film ever made.\\" By today's standards, the violence actually seems relatively tame. One could argue that more recent mainstream films like \\"Braveheart\\" outdo \\"Dawn\\" on both violence and gore. Much of the action has a slap-stick quality that suggests a \\"Roadrunner\\" cartoon albeit with several gallons of blood.    This is not to say that the film is a comedy though. In fact, many critics interpreted it as a biting commentary on the rampant consumerism that would ultimately overtake the country in the 1980s. With its shopping mall setting, zombies mindlessly trying to enter stores, and the heroes' growing infatuation with their \\"kid in a candy store\\" environment, it's hard not to see a message here.    But as the heroes quickly abandon any thought of finding people elsewhere for a life of insulated comfort and free home appliances, they are oblivious to how their actions might ultimately doom them. At the same time, Romero's insertion of television news commentators describing a society that is quickly falling apart is chilling in its realism.    I won't reveal the ending but will say that \\"Dawn\\" more than earns its status a classic that is at least as good as \\"Night.\\" And while the first film was clearly the scarier, \\"Dawn\\" has emerged as, by far, the more influential.    It spawned countless imitators, mainly directed by Italians like Lucio(\\"Zombie\\") Fulci whose apparent appettite for zombie flicks can only be matched by the French's passion for Jerry Lewis movies.  It's influence can also be seen in scores of comic books and video games like \\"Doom,\\" \\"Resident Evil,\\" and \\"House Of The Dead.\\" Hell, even Michael Jackson's award-winning \\"Thriller\\" video probably never would've been made if Romero's film hadn't sparked Jacko's already-tweaked imagination.    What is notable about this collection is that it presents no less than three versions of the film:  The Original U.S. Theatrical Release, The Extended Version, and the European Version.    Each version gets a separate commentary track but my favorite is the cast commentary on the European Version which reunites stars Foree, Ross, David Emge, and Scott Reininger.  The actors clearly had a ball getting back together to record the commentary.  Their observations and memories are insightful and often hilarious.    Of the three versions, the U.S. version however remains the superior cut.  The extended version, while offering previously unseen footage(see everything that happened at the docks when Steven and Fran first met up with Peter and Roger), frankly drags in spots.  The European version ups the ante with more gore but comes in with a shorter running time.   Unfortunately, it accomplishes this by excising some classic scenes.    As for the extras, this set contains more than you can shake a severed limb at.   Best among them are two documentaries, including the feature-length \\"Document of the Dead\\" which had previously been available only as a separate, stand-alone DVD.     There is no fluff here and devoted fans will literally want to comb through every poster gallery and TV spot.  Easter egg alert!   These discs also contain hidden bonus interviews.    As we know, Romero would ultimately go on to direct a third \\"Dead\\" film, the solid but less than great \\"Day of the Dead,\\" and executive produce a superfluous remake of \\"Night\\" in 1990.    With Romero himself, having acknowledged that \\"Day\\" fell short, he's long talked about a fourth installment that would bring the series to a suitably fitting end.     During one of Disc Four's documentaries he talks about that movie, \\"Dead Reckoning,\\" which recent media reports suggest is now in production albeit with a new and, unfortunately dopier title \\"Land of the Dead.\\"    The timing certainly seems right given that Zombie and Zombie-esque film have undergone a bit of a Renaissance.  Films like \\"28 Days Later,\\"  \\"Shaun of the Dead,\\" and the \\"Resident Evil\\" films have all hit theaters and enjoyed considerable success.  And of course there's this year's \\"Dawn\\" remake which some would say equals or maybe even surpasses Romero's original.    But there's no getting around the fact that the original \\"Dawn\\" is not only a classic but also a masterpiece.   Those who remember seeing it in theaters knew that afterwards nothing would ever be the same.    Buy this collection and see why for yourself.

1401300901|1.0|I found the premise of this book to sound entertaining.  A chick book....After five chapters, I was so bored and uninterested in it..that I left it (on purpose) at my nail care place.  Didn't even finish reading it....Total yawner!
0671027387|1.0|I made it halfway through the book, but no further will I go.  I know this book is supposed to be a work of fiction, set slightly in the future, yet the clumsy and glaring erros have me seething.  I can accept Clive Cussler-style heroics and nonsense; it is, after all, just a book.  But, as evidenced by some of the raptorous 5-star reviews below, too many readers think they are reading actual science facts, especially the information about NASA.<br /><br />And that information is flat out wrong.  The numbers for the International Space Station are inflated by a factor of 10 or more, and the stories of nations dropping out are fictional.  The descriptions of past launch failures are either made up for the story, or false, as with the NRO satellite - spy sats are launched by the Air Force, using launchers bought from private firms with DoD money - NASA has nothing to do with them - tracking is by the DSN run by JPL - all launch sites are owned by the Air Force - and so on.  It just infuriates me that many people will take this information hook, line and sinker and demand that NASA be abolished so that money can be spent on....well, not much, because it is a tiny fraction of the overall budget, smaller than almost every other government agency.<br /><br />Aside from that, many other science facts are wrong, many of the real-world items that the plot depends on are wrong, and many of the plot situations are poorly done.  I did not have high hopes for this book after reading Digital Fortress - I am a programmer who has worked with cryptography, and it is clear that Dan Brown's research for that book amounted to no more than an evening's conversation with a teenage hacker - but even those were dashed.  This book sucks.  I have never seen such ballyhoo over a writer who actually offers very little substance, unless one considers the second and present phase of Michael Crichton's career.
B0006SSOHC|3.0|I went to \\"see saw\\", simply because I am a huge elwes fan. I haven't always liked every film he's been apart of, but all in all he's very dependable. After reading the reviews of several critics and balancing whether or not I should spend the twenty bucks, I sauntered into the theater with low expectations. Frankly, I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Saw opens with two men in complete darkness. Only their voices are heard, as they figure out a way to turn the lights on. It takes a little courage to start a film this way. No explosions. No endless galaxies. Darkness and two voices. That drew me in pretty quickly. Then, once they take that step, the film begins.<br /><br />Saw is not perfect. Is any film? It has dozens of puzzles that unfold at exactly the time the plot deems it necessary. Yes, it feels sometimes forced. To me it felt like a train ride, you know its always going to go in one direction, but as long as you reach the destination, no one cares. I didn't. I just sat there, allowed the film to have its way with me, sipped my pibb, then walked away with a grin. It does touch on other films like se7en, which is sitting on my shelf right now, but if it wasn't made, would we still be bashing Saw? Also a key difference is in this we get to see the actual events, rather than the aftermaths. Also, you cannot guess the ending before it comes. Its near impossible. Yes, that's a challenge.<br /><br />I am going to conclude on this. I do recommend Saw, simply because it has managed to do something very few films have accomplished. It has a secret. A one million dollar budget. That is unheard of! It continues the trend of low-budget, independant films that are sweeping the globe in massive success. Saw has earned nearly 72 million dollars world wide. I say congratulations to all envolved, and cudos on making something out of nothing.

Following the attack, with Runciter apparently dead and unreachable in half-life, things in the world are changing rapidly... but why?  \\"Ubik\\" leads the rest of the firm through a deadly ordeal, one in which most will not survive.  Who will live, who will die, and who is behind the radical changes being made to the world? <br /> <br />\\"Ubik\\" is a good read for pure entertainment.  Part of the middle of the book was drawn out, hence only 4 stars.  Recommended for anyone with some spare time who wants to read a novel.
0767834739|4.0|Like one person said on here, the movie is great, but it seemed to be missing something. I wished the film focused more on the lickers, zombies, and Nemesis. Although it did a good job covering two of the three but it still seemed like the movie still could have done better. Was there a tighter budget compared to the first film?  <br />Anyways, I thought the story was about average for a film of this type. Nothing that will really surprise anyone.  <br />As for the characters, Milla Jovovich's character does steal the show but as we quickly learn, she is kind of the center of the movie. The acting though is just great! Definitely worth mentioning.  <br />Overall Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a great film. But it just seemed like something was missing. The movie could have been longer and focused more on the zombies, lickers, and Nemesis. But for what was given on the silver screen, it is satisfying. The DVD has a plethora of extras on it as well so you shouldn't get bored with it. Definitely worth a look if you are a fan of this kind of stuff.
B0006399FS|5.0|Time and again U2 has demonstrated why they're on the short list of the greatest bands in the history of rock and roll music.  How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is yet another example of what distinguishes this band from all the rest.  This album carries a singular sound, infectious hooks, meaningful lyrics, variable textures, stellar musicianship, and a lot of attention to detail.      U2 has developed each song on this album as an admirable work.  Separately these songs are independently worthy of adulation, but collectively they present a synergy that is rarely seen in albums these days.  Meticulous craftsmanship has come to define U2's songwriting and production, and it's wonderfully apparent here.  Throughout Atomic Bomb the band takes you through a variety of musical landscapes, frequently transitioning from one place to another within tracks.  Those transitions are what separate this band from others: as you listen you're captivated by HOW the band brought it all together as much as you're captivated by the great melody, music, lyrics, etc.  Consistent with past practice, U2 didn't put any filler on this album - if it wasn't worth listening to, it wasn't placed anywhere on How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb.      The album begins with the driving hit \\"Vertigo,\\" a fun freight train of a tune laced with Spanish (listen for the HOLA!).  After the rousing opener, \\"Miracle Drug\\" changes the pace with a plaintive, beautiful song containing oblique religious references - this blend of the secular and the spiritual is mesmerizing from start to finish.  \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" is a soft and poignant reassurance that we need each other.  The next track, \\"Love and Peace Or Else,\\" is reminiscent of a Led Zeppelin-style romp with a benign introduction that transforms to a groovy, funky pounding of heavy guitars.  The fifth track is one of my personal favorites on the album: \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" is a soaring, affective song with a heavenly sound and message.  \\"All Because of You\\" is another hard rocker that bears a compelling chorus and melody.  With \\"A Man and a Woman,\\" Bono explores the complexities of relationships between the sexes while backed by the acoustic guitar and the terrifically prominent bass guitar of Adam Clayton.  \\"Crumbs from Your Table\\" is a conscience-prickler of moderate tempo bearing an activist message.  Things slow down further with \\"One Step Closer,\\" another beautiful song with unapologetically spiritual overtones.  On \\"Original of the Species,\\" Bono reminds us that each of us is unique and that \\"some people got way too much confidence baby\\" (how true is that)!  Atomic Bomb gracefully closes with \\"Yahweh,\\" a title citing the Hebrew reference to God, a title which artfully conveys the message of this final song, the one selected to be the uplifting end note of this album.  \\"Yahweh\\" is part prayer/part worship song, and it has instantly become one of my very favorite U2 songs of all time.      I have been a U2 fan for most of my life.  With each successive album, this band has shown that they continue to care about their music.  The music U2 is making these days is the type that can be created only by seasoned artists who know themselves, are in touch with the world around them, and settle for nothing less than the best they can give in their art.  The band has always unabashedly laced their music with religious undercurrents, but those seem more overt in Atomic Bomb, a fact which makes the album even more appealing to me.  U2 has achieved such Herculean stature that they don't need to prove anything to anybody, and Atomic Bomb represents an honest work born of musicians who value, first and foremost, the art itself.  Commercial success is an inevitable byproduct of what they've created, given the worldwide popularity of this band.      So, I'd definitely encourage you to make How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb a part of your music collection.  The album is abundantly rewarding.
0316286850|3.0|\\"Making Faces\\" is a step-by-step beauty manual featuring many different looks that have been tested out on real people and celebrities, from the simple to the outrageous. While it may be a very entertaining book to just flip through or a good experimental beauty book, I found that this book wouldn't be the best bet for those who are looking for the basics of beauty. There is a short chapter or so about the essential makeup products and such, but not a whole lot of beauty basics. However, that shouldn't stop your enjoyement of this well-written book. The large size and format of the book makes it easy to read and the pictures are really nice as well. Another good feature is that all of the looks (or \\"faces\\"), not only feature detailed step-by-step instructions, but they also have a clear drawing of the procedure right next to it, which would be a plus for people who need a visual aid. Overall, this is a great book, but if you want a book that will show you beauty basics, check out something else.
0761536434|5.0|Video games have been an industry that has gotten more than it's fair share of flack. \\"They cause lazyness, truency, they are violent, etc.\\" The thing people forget though is that video games are FUN. The industry itself has become a mammoth, racking in millions and joining the film and music industries as one of the big players in the entertainment business. The book is a big, retrospective analysis of the history of electronic games, from there humble beginnings at M.I.T. to the contributions by the \\"video pioneers\\" Nolan Bushnell and Ralph Baer. The book highlights some of notable points in the ride, such as: <br />-The pinball business and how the success of pinball in the 70's made way to the transition of video arcades. <br />-\\"Pong\\" and how it's success broke the initial game installed at a bar in California due to coin overflow by the games popularity. <br />-The yen shortage in Japan caused by \\"Space Invaders\\" <br />-Atari, how it was the fatest growing company in the world, and became an arcade giant and the first successful home system company despite Nolan Bushnells liberal views on running a business (whirlpool board meetings, pot-smoking employees, a beer keg in his office) <br />-The food that inspired Pac-Man, the greatest video game of all time. <br />-The Golden Age of video games in the 80's, followed by the \\"video game depression\\" in 1983. <br />-PC computers and the games created for them (Commodore, Apple, Amiga, etc.) <br />-Nintendo, the game that saved the company, and how it brought back video games in the mid 80's with the NES, a robot, a toy gun, and a game with the main character named after the company landlord. <br />-The Nintendo/Sega war during the 90's <br />-The creation of the ratings board for video games due to games such as \\"Mortal Kombat\\". <br />-The new generation of video game systems with the X-box and Playstation systems. <br />-Many of the lawsuits and influential court cases caused by video games (ex. Tetris, Game Genie,etc.) <br /> <br />This book is a ton of fun to read, and with many interviews with some of the best in the business, it's a book that is also informative. Bravo Steve Kent on a job well done!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've been a loyal Green Day fan since Dookie, and as awesome as Dookie was, American Idiot is just pure Genius!  Most albums these days, if not for the past couple decades, only have 1 or 2 good songs... but DANG, this album does not have 1 bad song!  Everything is Green Day at their best... im begining to wonder how they are going to top this album when it comes time for the next one.  Their image has also grown immensely!  They are gorgeous grown up men who have experienced alot in their lives since Dookie, and as a result, American Idiot provides a more grown up sound.  GO GET THIS ALBUM... YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!!!!!!!
068987474X|5.0|Great, eye-opening book. I'm 37 and wish I had read it a LOT sooner than I did. Would have saved me years of anguish. I wish there were even more examples of the excuses we make but the ones they have cover enough for you to get the idea.
B00069YDXU|3.0|I am a great fan and saw this tour along with many others.  The energy just isn't present in this DVD performance.  ELP ceased to grow musically and the music became rote.  It shows!  After seeing it...and I did enjoy parts...I forgave Greg for leaving the band. The Royal Albert Hall performance is far superior, although Black Moon was cut from the footage,(Who decides these things?) ELP's energy in that performance and the audience's responce make it the next best thing to actually being there. Still, if you're a die hard, it's worth owning.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|I AM SICK TO DEATH OF RADIOHEAD COMPARISSONS! <br />Radiohead is my favorite band and I know for a fact, Tom Yorke was influenced by Jeff Buckley. Muse are also influenced by Jeff Buckley. So the singing is somewhat similar.Just like Franz Ferdinand and the Killers both like the Cure and New Order, so the Bass abd Guitars sound similar. <br />   But this just shows me how shallow people are about music. Just listen to the singer, everything else is second.  <br />  Muse is still second to me to Radiohead but I think muscially THEY SOUND NOTHING ALIKE! When was the last time you heard Radiohead do some hard riffing in Drop-D tuning? (Stockholm Syndrome) eh? NEVER! Musically (not singing) Absolution sounds NOTHING like Radiohead (I love Radiohead but these guys are not it). Theres lots of music out there thats sounds all the same (california punk for one) why are people making such a big deal about this? <br />   Anyway this album is really good. I will stop short of saying its great but compared to all the crap put out now it is definaty worth checking out. These guys are diffiently top notch musicians. <br />  And to anyone who judges music by the singer GO LISTEN TO YOUR BRITNEY SPEARS RECORDS!
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Heres the rundown: <br />1.) Straight out of Line: 10/10 Has one of the coolest guitar solos I've heard, but the opening war sounds don't do much for me - just get to the music already.   <br />2.) Faceless: 10/10 Excellent song, great guitar work. <br />3.) Changes: 9/10 I like this song a lot, but the chorus sounds too much like faceless. Cool, but it could have been more original. <br />4.) Make me Believe: 8/10 Formulaic Godsmack, i.e. hard-rocking guitars and vocals.  <br />5.) I Stand Alone: 10/10 The opening guitar riff sounds different from all of the other tracks, so it definitely stands out as a good song. <br />6.) Re-Align: 10/10 I listen to this one a lot because it reminds me of Awake. The solo blows me away. <br />7.) I F****** Hate You: 8/10 I actually like this song. The cursing doesn't phase me at all, in fact its kinda funny when you listen to it over and over, especially when he says, \\"even though you justify every f***ing bulls*** lie\\". Still, the song is cool as hell. <br />8.)Releasing the Demons: 10/10 Damn, here's a song I can sink my teeth into. The lyrics are deliciously dark and only Sully Erna could make it sound so demonic. But remember kids, no devil worshipping!  <br />9.) Dead and Broken: 7/10 Good solid song, but it doesn't excel in anything. Typical Godsmack guitar work. <br />10.) I Am: 10/10 Either my 1st or 2nd favorite song on the cd. The slow but powerful guitars are amazing. I want to fight somebody after I listen to it, its got so much energy. Especially when Erna says, \\"Can I guarantee you life? I don't think I can.\\"   <br />11.) The Awakening: 0/10 Yeah, why would you need to add an extra 90 seconds of meaningless chanting onto this cd? Maybe they put it in by accident. <br />12.) Serenity: 9/10 Nice acoustic song to end it. It kind of brings you down off the adrenaline rush you get from listening to the previous 10 (excluding the Awakening) songs. Seriously, its almost hypnotic.  <br /> <br />Overall, I give the cd a 9.8out of 10. Solid effort by Godsmack, go buy it.
B0001L3MI0|2.0|ended up being mediocre at best.   <br /> <br />When I saw the trailers for this movie, I thought this was going to be one of those great movies that really caused the viewer to pause and consider the possibility that alien invasion really could occur--and on a global scale, with huge space ships that could hover over entire cities.  The scenes of the huge shadows looming over entire cities were ominous and terrifying.  The idea that an alien species could simply pick and choose a planet that had resources that they needed--and take them by exterminating the entire population (much like mankind has done in the past) actually lends even more credibility to the concept of what I thought this movie was going to be about. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this movie ended up being a comedy for the most part.  With the ridiculous sub-plots, silly one-liners, and cute-and-cuddly ending, I walked away from this movie with great disappointment.  This movie could have been an epic masterpiece, but the producers decided to go with the \\"Hollywood formula\\" and ended up creating a typical, predictable yawnfest.   <br />
B0001NBMBC|3.0|In this album Corey Taylor and his bandmates took a softer, melodic direction into the heavy metal category and they do not sound as heavy as they used to be when they were screaming \\"the Heretic Anthem\\" to audiences all around the world. Many of the songs on this cd do not sound like Slipknot at all. Vermillion Part I does not sound like a Slipknot song at all when you compare it to songs on their past three albums. Listening to the song \\"Duality\\" many times can get boring after a while, unlike the debut song on the IOWA cd \\"Left Behind\\". There is just a much heavier feel on IOWA. The whole album is not bad because there are some great tunes that catch your attention like \\"The Blister Exists\\", \\"Three Nil\\", and \\"Pulse of the Maggots\\". This is a good album overall but not as good as IOWA.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|this girl is so crazy and bad I want to be like her her songs make me sad and happy at the same time is like i can handle the world and give a punch to it oh god it feel so good she is so sk8er and bad.Totally crazy.

B000000Y1H|5.0|That is one of life's more difficult questions because the more you listen to Monk the more you hear. Certainly that is true on this Cd. It ranks as one of my favorites because the music is so unpredictable and the musicians that are on this particular Monk recording do an amazing job interpreting Monk's compositions. Every cut is different and each  has something that just blows me away every time I hear it. Pannonica , the 3rd track is one of Monk's more understated and underrated tunes. His piano playing on that number can only be descibed as sweet.  The Blues turnarounds on Bal-Lue Bolivar with Monk and Sonny Rollins are knock-outs and Monk's version of I Surrender Dear is especially unique.<br /><br />I would be remiss not to mention Max Roach's drumming on this entire cd is fantastic but he particularly shines on Bemsha Swing. Then the icing on the cake is a beautiful trumpet solo on that cut by Clark Terry.<br /><br />This is certainly one of Monk's finest recordings and on certain nights it is my all-time favorite. Don't miss it.
B00065JTBA|5.0|Bon Jovi. The mear mention of the name brings on thoughts of catchy pop rock and big hair. Those were the days. But in all reality, Bon Jovi's \\"Days\\" have yet to end.  <br /> <br />Since entering the major leagues of music in 1984, Bon Jovi (the band...not JUST the man) have actually in truth only released 9 studio albums. They have other releases though that include Live albums, Greatest Hit Compilations as well as solo efforts (Jon, Richie, and David all have solo efforts) and such projects as \\"This left Just Feels Right\\". But the albums in and of themselves do not tell the full \\"Bon Jovi\\" story.  <br /> <br />So marking the official announcement that they have sold 100,000,000 records...which by my standards means a LOT of records, Bon Jovi has released a loaded down box set entitled \\"100,000,000 Bon Jovi Fans Can't Be Wrong\\". The set spans 5 total discs. 4 Music CD's and 1 DVD that is over an hour in length.  <br /> <br />The music included on the CD's is not the hits that put Bon Jovi where they are today. No. There are over 40 never before released tracks as well as 10 rarities included on this set. Apparantly this isn't even all of their unheard stuff as they even selected these songs carefully. Bon Jovi has a vault that would rival that of Tupac as far as unreleased stuff goes. The set spans Bon Jovi's entire career. The songs were not cut from the albums due to the fact that they are not good songs. They were all cut for alot of reasons. Either they are similar to another song in style OR they just didn't fit with the overall flow of the album. Alot of songs on this set really make you wonder why they were cut.  <br /> <br />Disc one includes such songs as \\"Why Aren't You Dead\\" which would have gave \\"Bad Medicine\\" a run for it's money. Disc one also includes the original version of \\"Someday I'll be Saturday Night\\" which blows the song they actually released out of the water in my opinion.  <br /> <br />Moving onto Disc 2 you get the power ballads \\"Maybe Someday\\" and \\"Every Beat of my Heart\\". Trust me...this is Bon Jovi...there are many more Power Ballads over the 4 Discs. Good stuff.  <br /> <br />Disc Three includes the highly sought after \\"Edge of a Broken Heart\\" which was a song cut from the \\"Slippery When Wet\\" album. Lots of fans have wanted this song for years. It was included in a movie called \\"Disorderlies\\" (staring 80's rappers The Fat Boys...hehe. I actually love this movie) years ago and was never released. Bon Jovi goes on record on the DVD and says he has no idea why he cut the song and apologizes. He also admits that he wanted to cut \\"Living on a Prayer\\" from the album   <br /> <br />Disc 4 contains two versions of a song \\"Love Ain't Nothing but a Four Letter Word\\" and both versions are very different. The set really gives you a good glimpse into a thorough song writing process. You get to see how different concepts on different songs really come into play.  <br /> <br />The DVD is really awesome. It has interviews with the band where they explain some of the songs on the album as well as what period the songs come from as well as why they left the songs off each album. It also included some very neat footage of Bon Jovi behind the scenes over the years. Interesting note from the DVD: Jon Bon Jovi is speaking of the album \\"Slippery When Wet\\" and the album title itself. He speaks of what the original plan for the title was and it really shocked me. He was looking for something that was really different and catchy and nearly ripped off the name of a little known band (at the time..lol) he had saw playing one night at a bar. The band....Guns N Roses. So \\"Bon Jovi: Slippery When Wet\\" was ALMOST called \\"Bon Jovi: Guns N Roses\\" Interesting. <br /> <br />FINAL ANALYSIS: I don't think I would recommend this set to anyone who isn't a fan of Bon Jovi. You pretty much HAVE to be one to appreciate this set. If you are a fan...please...get it. You will be anything BUT disappointed. It's excellent. No bones about it. You pretty much get what you missed on the previous albums. Side note...new Bon Jovi album coming in 05. They talk about it on the DVD that comes with this set. I heard them perform a new song from it called \\"Have a Nice Day\\" and we have alot to look forward to. Great song. <br /> <br />LETTER GRADE: A+
B000068PQ0|4.0|This was my first experience with The Flaming Lips. I think this is their most accessible album. It has beautiful melodies and the lyrics are just very human and express emotions that are often hard to put into words. To me, The Flaming Lips seem to be moving in the  opposite direction from another one of my favorite bands, Radiohead. Radiohead started out very accessbile with pop-rock licks until their recent ventures into electronic-experiemental music. The Flaming Lips, on the other hand, started out by playing relatively strange music, with songs that seemed too playful and lyrics that made no sense, to finding a happy medium of accessbile beautiful music.  <br />This is the best album to get of theirs if you've never heard any of their music besides their 1990s hit \\"She don't use jelly\\". Then, after this album, you can decide for yourselves if you like the direction that the Flaming Lips have gone into. I think they've brought music to a most beautiful and touching place that can only be described as the feeling one would get from meeting an alien and realizing that we're all essentially the same.
B000099T2L|4.0|i love this Cd i love the songs, Beyonce is a very good singer and songwritter.
B000002JB3|4.0|I promise to review this cd, but first some significant background: <br /> <br />Ever since Phil Collins' first foray into his solo career way back in 1981, Genesis fans have been rolling their eyes, sometimes screaming \\"Oh no!\\" or \\"Sellout!\\" and praying that he just concentrate on the seminal band:  \\"Please Phil, come back to us,\\"  they cry.  I was one of those back in the early years.  I had some degree of hope that Peter Gabriel's departure was perhaps only temporary (how naive of me to even think it).   <br /> <br />But lo and behold, Genesis quickly became just as commercial as Phil, and all hope was lost.  <br /> <br />Of course, the world has matured since then and now we can appreciate both Phil's solo work as well as his collaborations with Anthony Banks and Michael Rutherford, except for the horrible miscue \\"Illegal Alien,\\"  perhaps the stupidest song ever from Atlantic Records.   <br /> <br />So much for history; how about \\"Dance Into the Light?\\"  The title track is upbeat, uptempo, and really a terrific pop tune. Nathan East's bass playing is locked in wonderfully with Phil's solid drumming.  People forget that Collins is an accomplished man behind the drum kit.  His snare drum is clear and makes a statement, like on \\"Love Police.\\"  Once you get into the flow of the CD, it takes you exactly where you want to go in Phillandia.  For those concerned fans, if you truly want hardcore Genesis edge, then stick with 'Lamb Lies Down on Broadway,' or get yourself the most recent Peter Gabriel DVD, 'Growing Up.'
1577311523|5.0|I found this book by chance on a table \\"free to take\\" in my graduate school. A handwritten dedication reads \\"To father, xmas, love, Colin\\". Perhaps Colin's father is one of these skeptical intellectuals who accept nothing beyond their own narrow expertise...    I read the book. And... WOW... what an experience!... I must say that I have been reading and practicing alternative/New Age books, \\"therapies\\" and spiritualities for over 20 years now, and I had thought that, after knowing the likes of Osho and Tony Robbins, there would be nothing new in the horizon that I could look up to and say \\"Ah, here is something new and significant!\\"    Actually, \\"The Power of Now\\" may not teach you anything radically new. You may realize that it simply touches you in reminding you of the really essential things in life that we forget in the rat race of modern life: Eckhart Tolle tells us about the importance of being in touch within - and explains how to reach this state of awareness - in order to gain peace and perspective amidst modern turmoil. He reminds us of the importance of living in the here and now, transcending our ego-mind, our past and future...    The book provides a very contemporary approach to spirituality, in a refreshed and systematic manner. For example, while Osho spoke 400 books in a consistent albeit fragmented and provocative fashion, Tolle is able to synthesize it all in 191 sweetly written pages. Tolle quotes Jesus a few times, seemingly to please the Christian crowd, but actually he is essentially inspired by the Buddhist approach to existence. In any case, Tolle is smart in not giving out labels nor prozelytizing. As a good German, he is sometimes too speculative in his philosophy of Being, but this is quite secondary against the overall picture of this beautiful work.     There is, nonetheless, a real danger in \\"The Power of Now\\". You may become so serene and content, that various things that you trivially do will become meaningless. You will argue less, consume less, desire less, do less silly things, etc. Likewise, you may not be able to deceive yourself so easily ever again... It may take you a while until you regain your momentum after years in shallow materialism and social conditionings... Would you like to give yourself this chance, or are you satisfied with your current illusory situation?...    I do not know about yourself, but I know that this book has affected my life in a very positive way... Ah, and thanks to Colin's father for giving this book away. Maybe he found spiritual enlightenment and dropped his academic job?...
B0001LJC2K|5.0|though many are upset about this groups comparison to radiohead, i will say the similarities exist, and that's no negative thing.  music is kind of like science, constantly building upon itself.  you might as well say radiohead is like elvis or the beetles, innovators of rock.  anyway, i don't know where the band is coming from, but it seems like they expand and build upon radiohead-type music.  they take haunting melodies and instrumentation that compliments perfectly.  it sounds to me as if one or more members of the band had classical training in one or more instruments.  as soon as i played their music, i was completely absorbed, sucked in.  sunburn (on the showbiz album) is by far my favorite song, but this album has the largest number of awesome songs on it i have seen in a very long time.  it makes me feel like i  have to do something.  do what exactly?  well, i'm not sure yet, but it's gonna be something great. <br /> <br />p.s. i am disturbed by the number of times customer reviewers used \\"there\\" instead of \\"their.\\"  sorry, i used to be an english major.
B000002KE2|4.0|This 4th album proves without a doubt that Black Sabbath were the pioneers of heavy metal. I cannot recommend one song over another (except maybe throwing \\"Changes\\" at the bottom of the pile... it doesn't do much for me), nor can I really say this album is better or worse than \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Paranoid\\", or \\"Master of Reality\\". This is definitely an album to own, whether you are just getting into Sabbath, are a long time fan (and you don't have this album already, why?), or are looking for a little something different to add to an already diverse album collection.
0676973779|5.0|After reading the reviews of this book I felt compelled to write because so many of the reviewers seem to have missed the whole point of the book. I don't wish to give away the ending but in the last ten pages or so the author neatly punctures all the tales of derring do and tiger-management that have gone before with an alternative take on Pi's life at sea. Rather than bringing the reader closer to god, Martel is lampooning the insufficiency of organised religion to deal with extreme situations. Young Pi is forced to abandon his vegetarian, egalitarian, humanitarian gentility and draw upon the darkest aspects of his nature including murder and cannibalism (choices which adherents to Pi's adopted trinity of Hinduism, Islam and Christianity are technically prohibited from) to realise the one true religion of self-preservation. After the enjoyably preposterous tales of life at sea with a bengal tiger named Richard, the book was saved for me and made memorable by the revelations of Pi's alternative story.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Sure, they may have ruined somethings, but all in all it's still Star Wars. It just sucks because the \\"enhancements\\" only seemed to bring the quality down. Especially replacing the original Anakin with the new one. I mean Lucas obviously did it to please all of the new fans, but what about the ones that have been following these films ever since they came out or were old enough to understand them, that's like spitting in our faces. Not to mention the face of the original Anakin. The picture and sound quality are definitely better, but the added fx are cheesy for the most part, I just wish they would have left that stuff alone.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This film is so violent that it definitely was difficult to watch, but it does put Jesus' suffering into perspective. These were brutal times, and this is the way it was, like it or not.<br /><br />I also think Jim Caveziel's performance was outstanding and way beyond Oscar-worthy. I think it is funny that some other reviewer found it necessary to rip Mr. Caveziel because he played a murderer in another movie. What is the correlation there? Hello??? He is an ACTOR!<br /><br />BTW, I find it slightly suspicious that three of the latest reviewers to give this film 1 star also all reviewed only this film and Josh Groban Live at the Greek (also ripping that to shreds). Strange.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|I was a bit taken aback with this release. After hearing much of their debut album and playing my copy of \\"Iowa\\" about a thousand times, I was pretty much convinced Slipknot was a very good but formula-driven band. This album proved me wrong... They are good, but they broke the formula!<br /><br />Expect a more melodic album. There is more singing, less screaming. Guitar abilities shine more in this album than others, as the songs depart from the wall of noise into finer, more orchestrated pieces. Sure, there are songs that grab you by the back of your throat, but there are others that prove this band has talent beyond wearing masks and making noise.<br /><br />I was particularly surprised with the introduction of acoustic guitars in some songs. Though not your typical Slipknot stomp-fest, this album boasts a lot of variety in sound and music and really begins to open doors of opportunity (read: opportunity for air play) for the band.<br /><br />I think I still prefer \\"Iowa\\" for those decompression commutes home from work, but this album is definitely going to get a lot of play time from me.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|There are moments in each film so brilliant, so...unique, stylized...I immediately marked them as among the greatest movie sequences ever filmed: <br /> <br />Matrix:  in the subway, before Neo and Smith begin to fight <br /> <br />Reloaded:  in the park with the Oracle, and the slow motion arrival of Smith <br /> <br />Revolutions:  the last meeting of Neo and Smith, up until the fight begins
B0002IU988|5.0|I have listen to a lot of rock music in 2004. I have been a minor fan of Greed. Altered Bridge are far 'harder' with great guitar licks. The vocal are powerful reminisce of the late 70's with David Coverdale etc. Highly recommeded.
B000063DHL|5.0|Alexander the Great could've easily been an instrumental, it's such a greta song. Bruce's vocals on every song are just dead on. Amazing record, I think any music fan could appreciate this excellent piece of music, go buy it and enjoy!
B0000VAFO0|3.0|This movie seems to be a cross between Batman and Blade. I didn't really know what to think at first but after having time to reflect and rewatch it, I really like it. It has a pretty good story and acting with great effects.  The dark mood of the movie is also very nice.
B00005LC1H|5.0|This is the British Comedy by which all others are measured! <br /> <br />Do not pay any attention to the idiot's that gave this a bad review.  They obviously have no sense of humor or just don't get British humor.  This is a must see/buy!  You shall not be disappointed.
B00005JNBQ|3.0|Wow this movie didn't really do a lot for me but Uncle Rico and Kip had me laughing.  Napoleon and his crew just weren't funny.
1577311523|5.0|\\"True Spiritual Enlightenment.\\"   I am 34 years old. I cannot explain the journey it has been. December 24, 2004 is the day I got the book. I read every perfect word. The next day, my friend took a photo of me with her camera phone while we were out. We almost flipped out. I almost threw-up. The picture we looked at was my father healthy and alive, as he is now, and alive with my mother about 20 years younger, I was not there and the room in the photo was not the room I was in when it was taken. There were many lights in the photo. Immediately I called my parents; are both fine. Got home loaded picture on a pc and in the course of 4 hours almost every person who passed way in my life could be found in this ever-moving vibration, constantly changing. After 4 days this real, tangible Harry Potter like image slowed down, I got my message. The main image was an infant in a crib, after 4 hours I finally saw it, as I did see it, it became the entire photo. All other images rested in the background. This is a photo with my grandparents, my uncle, and my friend who died in 7th grade, many more. Other family members found people I never could have found if they didn't share in the photo that was peered at from coast to coast. It still sits there now. The, my obstacle was this. My mother tried to smother me with a pillow, PPD syndrome I guess. I survived, and she told me about it at age 8 because she noticed claustrophobic tendencies. \\"I got my self over that by age 14.\\" This is your obstacle, see it deal with it in this most tangible way, if you need us just look and you will find us.\\" The morning before the photo, I drew a picture of a ring, each diamond were to represent one person no longer alive. Days later I remember the drawing, and the puzzle was clear. The book gave me instant mental peace, and a deep connection to the spirit word.   It has something new to offer me everyday...the messages just keep on coming...    With great enlightenment,  Kathy wall  (...)
B0002KVUKM|4.0|This is the type of movie you just set back and enjoy. It does not require a lot of thinking, just that you set back and enjoy. Thats it! Its not a drama or a suspence thriller! Pure action with great effects.  Van Helsing is good, the lady he is helping is also, the Fankinstien monster is pretty good and the werewolves are great! The only complaint I had was that Dracula could have been better.
B00004XONN|4.0|Kid A is fantastic and I'll tell you why.  Because I'm listening to it right now and it's worth a quality listen to whenenver you decide to throw on your headphones.   <br />Although my rating is 4 stars, I'm actually giving it 4 1/2 because it's not quite a 5 for me, although I think exceptionally of this masterpiece tour de force of rock, dance, and metaphysical wham-a-bam to hammer home to the kapitalists. <br />The only reason I don't give this album a full fledged 5 is because the end of track #3 \\"The National Anthem\\" gets a little bit annoying.  Besides that little bit, Kid A has larger than life, amazing tracks like \\"How To Completely Disappear\\" and \\"Optimistic\\".  The one phunky dance number, \\"Idioteque\\", is really something to get down to.  The instrumental metaphysiqal piece \\"Treefingers\\" is really beautiful, too.   <br />If you are new to Radiohead, I definitely recommend buying \\"Kid A\\" along with either \\"Amnesiac\\" or the Radiohead live CD.  Very good stuff.  I'm not watering \\"OK Computer\\" down...I'm just saying that Kid A is like the 2nd half of Radiohead's amazing career and it shows them blooming from more than just a rock band, almost like a neo-Emerson, Lake and Palmer meets London Fog and Radiohead can save the world! <br />O.K, Kid A gets 4.75 stars, thank you, Ed McMahon!! <br /> <br />
B0000004F9|5.0|Putting these two albums on one cd seems to work very well.  It's a great documentation of Soft Machine's musical evolution (the band was ALWAYS changing--sound and lineup).   <br /> <br />These are two of my favorite albums, and I like both of them for their own reasons.  Volume 1 marks the end of the band's run with Kevin Ayers, who brought a simple, playful, pop spirit to the band (Robert Wyatt did this too, in a jazzier way).  The compositions are not terribly demanding, but they are great nonetheless, augmented by Wyatt's frantic drumming and Mike Ratledge's brilliant keyboard/organ skills.  The mostly improvised interludes are slight hints of what was to come. <br /> <br />When they brought on Hugh Hopper (bass) for Volume 2, the band took a turn to jazz influenced, more complicated pieces.  Robert Wyatt's lyrical humor sticks in there in some places (\\"A Concise British Alphabet\\", \\"Hulloder\\", \\"Pataphysical Introductions 1/2\\"), but Ratledge's edgy composing genius is thuroughly excersized.  The \\"Esther's Nosejob\\" suite is quite possibly my favorite musical recording ever.  Hopper gets his word in there too, with his fantastic bass playing and some of his own compositions.  \\"Dedicated To You But You Weren't Listening\\" is very strange, acoustic Hopper piece, unlike anything the band would ever record again. <br /> <br />These two albums are a good introduction to Soft Machine.  Listen on to the group's other albums, and notice how they never stayed in the same place for too long...
B00005JMUL|4.0|I think the charm of this movie comes mostly from the fact that they have rendered the animation directly from the book.  It is hard to appreciate what they have done unless you have the seen the book illustrations first.   <br /> <br />I thought the movie was terrific, but a bit long for the little ones.  My 3 1/2 yr old sat through it, but looked somewhat overwhelmed during some of the more intense action scenes.  I think he will enjoy it more next year when he is older and we can watch it in the comfort of our home, no doubt the DVD will go on sale the day after Thanksgiving 2005.
B00003W8NM|4.0|First off this movie is not about fighting. It plays a small role, very small. The movie is much larger than that.  The story is great, acting is great, filming is great. I will say this though, the movie is unusual. An the ending is one of the best I have ever watched! You will be setting there in disbelief. You really should give this movie a watch.
B00005OWEG|4.0|Obviously, this is a great movie.  I loved and was blown away by the original.  I decided that if some was good, more must be better.  I was wrong.  Still a great movie; but not as fine as the original.<br /><br />With the exception of the plantation scene - I'll get back to that scene, all the added footage detracted from the value of the original.  The added scenes were, most prominently, gratuitous and grubby T&A and sex scenes which added nothing to the movie and distracted from the flow.  They are silly cul-de-sac's.  Some have praised the added footage on the surfing scene and say that the surf board theft was interesting.  I think it weakened the original scene.  And the only reason for the surf board theft was to set up the (boring) scene of the boat hiding from Kilgore.<br /><br />To me the only worthwhile added footage was the French plantation scene.  It's good on several levels:  it's mysterious and tough.  It gives a clue about the politics of Vietnam and the war.  It's beautifully shot.  And, best of all, the bedroom scene is brilliantly, beautifully sexy.  Unlike the other sex scenes, this one is great.<br /><br />The only other good extra is the scene where Willard is in the container-thingy at Kurtz's compound and the light plays across the scene and his face.  Brilliant cinematography; but it doesn't really add to the story.<br /><br />It's true in almost every creative form:  writing, photography, film, cooking, etc.  Less is usually more.  What most people need more than anything else is a good editor.  Cut out the dross so the gem can shine.  It's true here as well.<br /><br />Here's the punchline:  I lost my copy of Redux.  I'll be replacing it with a copy of the (more expensive) original.
B00005N7Z1|5.0|robocop is explosive from beginning to end. from the very beginning where he is human to where he gets gunned down(the shooting doesn't last very long on DVD as it did on the big screen- that's my only complaint)to where he becomes transformed into robocop and he then exacts revenge on those that killed him and then on dick jones after he gets fired from OCP. this is non-stop action, but also lots of violence and foul language. i would not recommend it to anyone under 13.
B00003CXIY|3.0|I thought this move would be as stupid as American Pie. However I was wrong. I was laughing so hard. I saw the unrated version to see if it would be different then the rated version.  (...) Come on give me a break! The story line and the comedy scenes were funny though. We could have done without the nude women, all the time. I would buy this movie anyway.
B00030590I|5.0|I shall avoid the repetitive plot retellings and focus on what worked for me. <br /> <br />1.  I found the use of different color pallettes for different scenes breathtaking.  It helped to convey mood and set the scene.  Not something we see a lot of in Western cinema.  Innovative, original, and worked very well to move the story along and set each scene.  It was almost as if the colors became characters in the film. <br /> <br />2.  The fight scenes were very well-choreographed, but not the meat of the film.  The characters interacted with the world around them wonderfully.  The scenes on the lake and in the forest with the leaves were excellent.  Also watch the Jet Li/Maggie Cheung arrow scene.  The ability of both actors to move the way they do (accepting that wires were involved, I'm not totally naive) is flawless.  I still command Maggie Cheung and Ziyi Zhang; for non-martial artists, they can move as a fighter very well. <br /> <br />3.  Speaking of actors, I cannot fault any of them.  An all-star cast without a doubt.  I love Maggie Cheung, and it is obvious that Jet Li makes better Asian films than American films; for some reason, American filmmakers cannot get past the \\"hack and slash\\" martial arts film.  Asian filmmakers can, and they really showcase Jet Li's depth.  The acting alone could make this a five star film. <br /> <br />4.  The ability of the crew and writers to put different spins and subtle nuances on each version of the story was a high point of the film.  While the non-linear storytelling had the potential to be distracting, and on a certain level was the first time around, the writing, cinematography, and acting made each version different, unique and it's own. <br /> <br />Ok, the beef:  Tarantino needs to leave his hands off these films.  Period.  I have the original Chinese Special Edition, and although even the menu is in Chinese and I have to guess how to turn on the English subtitles, I find it to be a far superior film.  The subtitling was better, there was about 10 minutes of extra footage.  Little things, but they made a difference, especially by the end of the film where the Nameless has to make his decision.  Especially the subtitles. <br /> <br />One other issue I want to address. A number of reviewers have complained about this being a \\"propaganda piece\\".  All I can say is \\"so what if it is?\\"  It is also a visually stunning film with a great deal of emotional depth.  American cinema can only hope to be this good! <br /> <br />Oh, I lied.  One last issue.  If you're thinking this is just another \\"chop-sockey\\" flick, please read the reviews (and the dvd box) before complaining that it isn't.  By now, unless you've been living under a rock, you should know there's more to this than just a few good fight scenes.
B0000AOV85|3.0|I thought this DVD was a pretty good one to sit down and watch for the first time.  It was very informative but the songs were mostly cut out by the documentary part of it.  They rarely, if ever, played a full song without interruption and I guess I expected that a little bit.   <br /> <br />I gave it three stars cause I think the info is very good and it shows how Dark Side was made pretty well.   <br /> <br />On the other hand, you (I) will probably have to wait a while before you watch it again.  I impulse bought it several months ago and haven't watched it since.
B00008DDSC|5.0|In a nutshell, this movie is about getting exactly what you want from the exact person you want.  By meeting each other's needs and exceeding each other's expectations, Lee and Edward each thrive.  Maggie Gyllenhaal's (Lee) transformation is amazing.  She morphs from the girl you would avoid on a bus to the girl you want to take home to meet the family.<br /><br />Plus, the movie is just sexy as hell.  Some may be disturbed by the light kink and S&M.  However, if you look beyond the slightly outside the norm sexual practices, all you see is a love story.  I adored the movie and had to buy both the DVD and soundtrack.  It's a real treat.
1400032717|4.0|I was unaware of the author, Mr. Haddon's, history that he had worked in a 'special needs' school.  (It probably explains why  the teacher in the book is always \\"dead-on right\\" about the boy and the school's administration wants to follow rules to the child's detriment) Behavior that is baffling to outsiders is explained through the mind of a an autistic child. The boy's methodical exploration of a neighborhood dog's murder is interrupted with frequent non-sequiturs about mathematical puzzles, science trivia and the like. The book is a quick read and a very fulfilling use of the readers time.  I highly recommend this novel. The only draw back in the writing style is the boy's constant detailed justifying of his even most simple actions, get's a little tiring, but opens an important window into the child's unique mind.
B00005JMCN|5.0|Hollywood can make great movies.  However, it seems in this era of special effects and superheroes that it is difficult to make a movie about characters or historical events that proves that people can be charmed by this type of movie.  \\"Seabiscuit\\" is one such movie that succeeds in being excellent.<br /><br />\\"Seabiscuit\\" is the true story of an undersized horse with a lot of spirit who met with an oversized jockey with a lot of spirit and an owner with too little spirit and a horse trainer with a focused spirit.  A lot of spirit for one movie, but in real life and in the movie, these people needed each other to be more than they were, and more than they could be.  Indeed, the movie even states that maybe the entire country needed the story of Seabiscuit; maybe they did.<br /><br />The movie starts very slowly.  We quickly meet the three characters who will be instrumental in forming Seabiscuit into a champion, fast forwarding through their life in combination with the events of the \\"Great Depression.\\"  I must admit that initially I had a hard time staying with the movie because of the semi-documentary style of the film and the pacing.  However, bear with this portion of the movie because the character development is important to the second half of the movie.<br /><br />Once the characters come together, we also follow Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire in one of the best acted roles in which he has appeared) as he matures as a jockey and Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) as he returns from the void into which he fell when his son died.  We also have an opportunity to appreciate the character of Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), whose life is about horses.  These three remarkable people meet with an abused horse with an ability that only Tom Smith recognized.<br /><br />The movie follows Seabiscuit as he makes a name for himself and West Coast horse racing, eventually challenging the reigning champion of the day, War Admiral, a distant cousin.<br /><br />I am only able to give you the merest hint of the excellence of the cast.  The people selected for their roles performed phenomenally well, and perhaps there should have been more Academy Award nominations for the cast.  As it was, the movie had very difficult competition in the year of its release, overshadowed by \\"The Return of the King.\\"  One character who adds some lightness to this serious movie is William H. Macy as Tick Tock McGlaughlin, a radio announcer.  Watching him create his own sound effects while keeping up a running spiel was fascinating and humorous.<br /><br />I tend to rate movies throughout as I watch them.  This movie started with two stars.  It slowly built to three stars.  At the three quarter point I was up to four stars, and the finish of the movie, which I thought was excellent, allowed me to rate this movie at five stars.  Therein lies my warning to the viewer; give this movie a chance.  \\"Seabiscuit\\" is an excellent movie that deserves to be watched from beginning to end.ive you the merest hint of the excellence of the cast.

B00008BRB5|5.0|\\"Synchronicity\\" was the fifth and final full-studio album by the trio, The Police.    This album was a monster success that was propelled by the hit single \\"Every Breath You Take\\".  To say that \\"Synchronicity\\" was a monster success because of that one song is greatly inaccurate.  On this album, The Police had shown they had arrived.  The first two albums \\"Outlandos D'Amour\\" and \\"Regatta De Blanc\\", The Police established their foundation sound - basically a sound that consisted of elements of Punk, Reggae, and Jazz.    On the next two albums \\"Zenyatta Mondatta\\" and \\"Ghost in the Machine\\", The Police began to expand that foundation sound to have more of a Classic Rock sound - along with some deeper lyrics   It seems with each successive album, The Police continued to grow as a band.  \\"Synchronicity\\" marks the band completing their evolution.   Because of its commercial success, many consider this a Pop album.  I tend to disagree - yes there are some Pop elements, but there are also Classic Rock Elements, elements that have the old style of The Police, and even some new avenues.   The result - another homerun by the trio. <br /> <br />On \\"Ghost in the Machine\\", The Police had begun to experiment with the use of Keyboards and Horns in their music.   This trend continues on this collection.  However, the foundation of the band Sting's Bass, Andy Summers' Guitar, and Stewart Copeland's Drums are very much present.  In fact, I think each of the band members give their strongest Bass, Guitar, and Drum work respectively.   One thing is that Sting continues to be the main songwriter for the band.  Sting had always liked to make use of metaphors in his songwriting - this collection represents the best use of metaphors possible. <br /> <br />\\"Synchronicity I\\":  This is a powerful opening song.  There is a great keyboard intro, but Stewart Copeland's drumming is ferocious.  Sting's vocals are right on the mark with great harmonies.  The word Synchronicity is based on Jungian Theory that refers to a coincidence of events that are meaningfully related.   This song gives lots of examples of that.  <br /> <br />\\"Walking in Your Footsteps\\":  This is a very unique song that is dominated by an African sounding percussion.   This is a very underrated track.  Sting draws an analogy to the path we are going down in today's world to the path the Dinosaurs took (toward extinction).  Sting vocals also shine. <br /> <br />\\"O My God\\": This another underrated track.  Sting's Bass, Andy's Guitar, and Stewart's Drums are outstanding on this track providing for some great instrumentation.  The Horn Work that started on \\"Ghost in the Machine\\" is back for this song.  Lyrically, this is a song where Sting is being to doubt his spiritual beliefs. <br /> <br />\\"Mother\\":  This is definitely an experimental track by The Police.  This was not only a song written by Andy, but it features Andy on vocals! I think this is a great change of pace.   There is almost a Middle-Eastern Sound to this song - but there also is a very bizarre element to this song.   Definitely an example of new avenues pursued by The Police. <br /> <br />\\"Miss Grandenko\\":  This is Stewart Copeland's lone penned song on the collection.  This has a very catchy beat.  It somehow seems like The Police's version of \\"Mrs. Robinson\\".  It also has a feel to their older material. <br /> <br />\\"Synchronicity II\\":  Like \\"Synchronicity I\\", this is a powerful song.   Stewart's drumming is ferocious throughout, but Andy Summers provides some incredible guitar work as well.   Sting is on top form with his vocals.   Although the word \\"Synchronicity\\" isn't used in this song, this time the coincidence of events are now applied to suburban family life.  On \\"The Police - Live\\" album, \\"I and II\\" are played to back to back and segue nice.  On this album, \\"Miss Grandenko\\" provides a nice segue to this song.  <br /> <br />\\"Every Breath You Take\\": Despite being the monster hit, I think it's the collection's weak spot.  Not only has it been overplayed, but it has been over sampled in too many other songs (especially in Sting's work).  It's a simple song.  Sting provides some excellent Bass melodies and Stewart does a relatively simple, but effective drum patterns. <br /> <br />\\"King of Pain\\":  This might have been a Top 10 smash, but it is far from a Pop Song.  I think this perhaps the strongest song done by the trio on any collection.  The Piano intro is outstanding and of course, Stewart, Andy, and Sting are incredible on Drums, Guitar, and Bass respectively.  This is a very Dark song chock full of some great metaphors. <br /> <br />\\"Wrapped Around Your Finger\\":  Same category as \\"King of Pain\\" - a Top 10 smash, but far from a Pop Song.  This is another song loaded with metaphors and nouns such as \\"Scylla\\", \\"Charybdis\\",  and \\"Mephistopheles\\".  This song also has a haunting element to it.  I think Sting's Bass work is underrated in this song. <br /> <br /> \\"Tea in the Sahara\\": Here we begin to hear a Jazz element ( a prelude to Sting's first solo album).  This song is a cross between Jazz and light Middle Eastern song.  There also is a haunting element to this. <br /> <br />\\"Murder By Numbers\\": This song wasn't included on the Vinyl version, but was a B-side to \\"Every Breath You Take\\".  This song also has a Jazz Element that reminds you almost of a Supper Club.  This is another dark and haunting song, but it is a very good piece of work by the Police. <br /> <br />In terms of the commercial sales of \\"Synchronicity\\", I do think that much of this was due to the fact that \\"Every Breath You Take\\" was such a monster pop hit.   While I do think the content of \\"Synchonicity\\" did win a lot of mainstream fans overt to The Police' style of music, I do think if the Police had made another album shortly after \\"Synchronicity\\", they would have trouble with matching the commercial success of \\"Synchronicity\\".  Overall, this is a great album - highly recommended to all fans.
0767834739|5.0|Let me start off by saying I'm not a major fan of American action flicks or comic book movies. Although, I love Hong Kong action, sci-fi horror and zombie flicks. I'm an older guy so I remember seeing the original DAWN OF THE DEAD in 1978. It's still the greatest horror movie ever made. But, don't compare this with other zombie flicks. IT'S A COMIC BOOK MOVIE AND IT'S BASED ON THE GAME. I've also played most of the RESIDENT EVIL games and I have to say, this is the HOTTEST VIDEO GAME MOVIE FRANCHISE going. Some of the scenes are straight out of the games. The first RESIDENT EVIL flick was great, but this one only enhances the first film.<br /><br />Yes, RESIDENT EVIL APOCALYPSE is a popcorn action flick. Let's face it, they didn't make this movie for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. This one is strictly for the gamers and action fans. And I can understand why people don't like it. But, if you're into the technical aspects of films making and you love action, I beg you to take another look at this film. (Of course, you need to see RESIDENT EVIL first. Otherwise, you may be lost.)<br /><br />One of the things that really blew me out of the back of the movie theater and my living room was the action direction by Alexander Witt. This guy really knows his stuff. This is his first feature, but he's done a lot of second unit action directing on films such as MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. RESIDENT EVIL APOCALYPSE is 90 minutes of non-stop action. There are some good John Woo moments in this, too. The bullet spray from the Nemesis' mini-gun is exquisite. Watching that concrete splash behind Milla Jovovich is sheer poetry. LOVING IT!!<br /><br />But what ultimately sets this film apart from standard sci-fi action flicks is the EDITING. I studied this film hard the second time I watched the DVD. IT REALLY IS A MARVEL of MONTAGE, STORYBOARDING, JUMP CUTS, FAST EDITS, DISSOLVES, and EFFECTS EDITING. All I can say is WOW!! It is hyper-kinetic, which I know, turns a lot of people off. But, if you like the new wave of hyper-kinetic action film, you're gonna love this.<br /><br />The art direction is superb and even the story was intriguing. There are some plot holes, but hey, it's a COMIC BOOK and I made up some of my own exposition. A Global Corporation named UMBRELLA with too much power and money experimenting with BioWeapons and expenable, genetically enhanced humans. Something to think about when you have a government in this country that has experimented with mind-control, telepathy, remote viewing, and God only knows what else. Some conspiracy theorists believe that AIDS was a bioweapon virus that got out of control. RESIDENT EVIL has the T-Virus. The story hits hard in the wake of the discovery of the human genome, cloning, and biological warfare. Remember, science fiction sometimes becomes science fact. And, corporations are out of control. So the whole notion of a corporation, probably funded by the military, making viral superweapons out of soldiers sends chills down my spine. Although, the Nemesis brought me back down to Earth. He's a scream. There's also a media cover-up at the end that's more plausible than you can possibly imagine. Good stuff.<br /><br />After watching the DVD extras, (and there's a bunch), you get to see how much work the actors, stunt people, and effects people, went through to make this flick. Even the extras went to zombie school. The actors participated in hours of weapons and martial arts training. Milla Jovovich wanted to do the free fall stunt where her character, Alice, runs over 200 feet down the side of the Toronto City Hall building, but director Witt talked her out of it. A stuntwoman did the big drop. Milla does make the last 60 feet of the fall, which looked quite intense, herself. (I climb telephone poles for a living. 60 feet is high!!) The weapons are all real. The mini-gun that the Nemesis character uses in the film was custom made and brought down from it's original weight of over 100 lbs. to 70 lbs. for the actor William G. Taylor who stands over 6 foot 7. The first time he shot it, it actually knocked him back from the recoil. NOW THAT'S GETTING INTO THE ROLE, MAN. When you watch all the pieces that went into the making of the flick you'll realize what a labor of love it was for all of those involved. THANKS, GUYS. I LOVED IT!! I watched it back-to back. Once with the Widescreen and once with the Pan and Scan settings. THE DVD HAS BOTH. I understand Milla's commentary is funny. I haven't heard it yet. Her commentary on the first RE was hilarious.<br /><br />As Shawn Edwards from FOX TV said, \\"FANS OF THE GAME WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE.\\" It's like ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK meets NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Nice. This has CULT CLASSIC written all over it.<br /><br />IF YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND WHO LOVES SCARY MOVIES, SCREEN IT FOR HER. AT TIMES, THIS FLICK IS JUMP-OUT-OF-YOUR-SEAT SCARY.

When you watch all the pieces that went into the making of the flick you'll realize what a labor of love it was for all of those involved. THANKS, GUYS. I LOVED IT!! I watched it back-to back. Once with the Widescreen and once with the Pan and Scan settings. THE DVD HAS BOTH. I understand Milla's commentary is funny. I haven't heard it yet. Her commentary on the first RE was hilarious.

B0002EQ7EC|5.0|The songs on this CD blend into each other nicely but each is also gorgeous in its own right.  This is by far my favorite Paul Simon CD.  The lyrics are just beautiful, sensitive and emotional, and the accompanying music is soothing, fitting and original.  If I could only ever listen to one CD for the rest of my life this would be it.  The messages are subtle and the lyrics are extremely aptly chosen.  You have to experience this CD in order to understand it.  As I've discovered is true about most good music, you have to play it two or three times for it to really \\"take,\\" but once you do it will reap the benefits of the struggle one hundred fold.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Amazing , i must say i'm a big fan of queen. i bought all their videos, dvd concerts and the only live concert i couldn't get was their live performance on live aid.  i've heard of commentaries of many artist who performed on live aid,that said that queen stole the show, and i don't know why, i heard of this concert as one of the best concerts of all time and there played varios famous artist as well. so why queen stole the show? maybe it had to be that good. so i was wainting for this release for a long time.  finnaly it's out, and after watching the whole queen performance on live aid, it just amazing, the performance on live aid was the best they have done in all their career, and the best performance of all time in any live concert. it's outstanding.    You should know that at that time queen was not so good, due some problems with the media, and maybe because of an failure album they made in those years, even Queen wasn't supossed to perform on live aid, they were invited on the last minute. so the people who went to wembley stadium, wasn't fans of queen at all.  but when they played 'Radio ga ga' all people went mad, then played 'Crazy little thing called loved' and the people where crazy even more, imagine when they played 'we will rock you' and 'we are the champions'. you have to see how the media took photos of the people singing 'we are the champions of the world!, Amazing.....    queen performance paid the $27.99 itself for the entire dvd set.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I simply could not get into this movie... at all!  I know a few people who really like this film, but they were still in onesies when most of the \\"kitsch\\" depicted was reality... Furthermore, there are so many eras depicted here at once that only those who were too young to understand what was going on in the 70's & 80's would find 'Napoleon Dynamite' amusing.  I gave a 1 star rating for the milk tasting scene & and the way Napoleon power chugs Gatorade after his \\"work-out\\" - probably the best parts of the entire film.
B00005JKN9|4.0|Martin Scorcese's \\"Gangs of New York\\" bypasses the moon and attempts to shoot for Alpha Centauri, such is its ambition to tell the untold story of New York's (and America's) violent foundation.  While Scorcese and his team have undeniably succeeded in creating a historical New York that has never been seen on screen before, their choices of what to focus on in that recreated world prevent the film from reaching its full potential. <br /> <br />The movie famously opens with a gang fight in the Five Points of Manhattan in 1846.  Of course, to refer to this clash between the \\"natives,\\" led by Bill \\"the Butcher\\" Cutting (played with monstrous glee by Daniel Day Lewis) against the Irish immigrants, led by \\"Priest\\" Vallon (the wonderful Liam Neeson) as a \\"fight\\" is the ultimate understatement.  The Irish force, a collection of motley gangs, emerge from the bowels of the earth armed with unimaginably fierce weapons to face off against the Natives, who are no less vicious.  After brief paeans to the God of War (a modern beatific God has no place in this New York), hand-to-hand combat that rivals anything ever shown on screen breaks out.  Priest Vallon falls under the Butcher's knife, and his Dead Rabbits gang is outlawed.  Vallon's son escapes to Hellgate Prison, and the Butcher is ascendant over the Five Points. <br /> <br />Sixteen years later, Priest's son Amsterdam (Leo DiCaprio, famously miscast) returns to the Five Points in a quest for revenge.  Fortunately for us, Amsterdam's hiatus from the Five Points gives Scorcese numerous opportunities for Amsterdam to be educated about the changes to his former home, and through Amsterdam's education we also see what life is like in this nefarious neighborhood.  The expository scenes of life in 1862 Manhattan are the high points of the movie, as they are captured with a stylish realism that is both beautiful and terrifying.   <br /> <br />While the rich may believe they control New York, and Boss Tweed (Jim Broadbent) is building Tammany Hall into a powerful machine, the Butcher rules over the teeming masses.  These are the \\"peasant\\" class, too poor to buy their way out of the Civil War draft (\\"$300 may as well be $3,000,000\\"), resentful of the rights being bestowed on African-Americans (although much more colorful appellations are used), and carrying a vicious hatred of President Lincoln.   <br /> <br />Unfortunatley, while this world is at our fingertips, we spend a great deal of time watching Amsterdam pursue a beautiful pickpocket (Cameron Diaz), who has a history with Bill the Butcher.  While most of the acting in this movie is exceptional, Leo and Cameron are not properly cast here.  Leo is a wonderful actor in the right situation, but he is far too much of a lightweight to be the proper counterpoint to Daniel Day Lewis.  Diaz has too much inherent sunny optimism to inhabit her character as written, despite her most game efforts.  It is clear that Leo and Diaz gave it their all here, but it's also clear that both actors give us about ten different Irish accents. <br /> <br />The movie's tale of Amsterdam's revenge against Bill for the murder of his father tracks the same line as the city's imminent eruption during the Draft Riots.  These scenes of carnage are as masterful in their own way as the opening fight scene, and Scorcese captures the mania of a city coming apart.   <br /> <br />After all is said and done, one sits back and exhales in wonder that such a story could have happened in the Big Apple, and we never knew it.  This makes \\"Gangs of New York\\" a worthy film, and several performances -- not the least Scorcese's -- are also praiseworthy.  But the love story allegedly at the movie's heart really doesn't measure up, and keeps the movie from soaring into its intended stratosphere.
B0006284JQ|5.0|My answer to the above question is neither. I think it is right on time.  I am a huge Britney fan. This album is amazing and at the same time, a bit nostalgic. The DVD is also great. Here is a song-by-song review of the album. 1.) MY PREROGATIVE - (4 stars)  An awesome song with a great message. It is true to the wild untamed spirit of Britney. The beat is great. There is something about the way the song slows down in a certain spot that keeps it from getting a 5. 2.) TOXIC - (5 stars)  One of the best Brit songs ever. The beat and musical arrangements are excellent. Alot of non-Britney fans gave her respect after this song. 3.) I'M A SLAVE 4 U - (5 stars) The pivotal transformation from Britney the little girl to Britney the vixen.  Have you ever danced to this at a party? It is totally hot! 4.) OOPS!... I DID IT AGAIN - (5 stars) This is classic Britney all the way. This song really kicked Britneymania into overdrive back in 2000. 5.) ME AGAINST THE MUSIC (feat. Madonna) - (4 stars) I like this song but the beats tend to drown out Brit's voice. Also, they could have added a bigger part for a legend like Madonna. 6.) STRONGER - (4 stars) I love this song. The positive message in it is cool. I also love the reference to \\"Baby One More Time\\" saying //My lonliness ain't killin' me no more//  It gets a 4 though because this is my mom's favorite and she is 50. That is just creepy. 7.) EVERYTIME - (5 stars) This is my favorite of the ballads. It's simplicity is touching. This is the best Brit's voice has ever sounded. You can tell it comes from the heart. Who can't relate to this song? 8.) ...BABY ONE MORE TIME - (5 stars) Ahh, the one that started it all. It's infectious beats and raspy vocals have made it a pop classic for years to come. 9.) (YOU DRIVE ME) CRAZY (THE STOP REMIX) - (5 stars) I love dancing and singing to this. I remember being so dissapointed that this wasn't on the original album.10.) BOYS (THE CO-ED REMIX) (feat. Pharell Williams) - 5 stars) This isso much better that the original. That extra little sound effect in the background, Pharell's part, and the dance breakdown make for a great song.11.) SOMETIMES - (4 stars) This is an excellent song but looking back in retrospective it is a big sugary sweet and poppy.12.) OVERPROTECTED (THE DARKCHILD REMIX) - (5 stars) I can't honestly say I like this better than the original because I like them the same. Great beat and effects.13.) LUCKY - (5 stars) Britney's shining achievement. This was always my favorite up until \\"Everytime\\" and \\"Lonely\\".  This song tells a great story. But, could Britney be talking about herself?14.) OUTRAGEOUS - (4 stars) This kind of baffles me that this is on here and not \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\". I mean this was one of my favorites off of \\"In the Zone\\" and regardless of the no video factor, it had solid radio airplay.  Great middle eastern vibe to it.15.) I'M NOT A GIRL, NOT YET A WOMAN - (5 stars) This song is a great coming of age story. One of Brit's best in the vocal category.16.) I'VE JUST BEGUN (HAVING MY FUN) - (5 stars) You can tell Britney wrote this. The beat is reminiscent of No Doubt's \\"Hella Good\\".17.) DO SOMETHIN' - (3 STARS) Very \\"Toxic\\" like. I like it though it is weird hearing Britney saying some of these things.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Sofia Coppola's \\"Lost in Translation\\" is, for lack of a better word, a masterpiece.  Grounded by two wonderfully restrained performances by two talented actors as well as a pitch-perfect supporting cast, this movie tells a melancholy, intelligent romantic tale of two lost Americans who find redemption in each other.   <br /> <br />There may not be a better city in which to cast Americans adrift than Tokyo.  Ms. Coppola's personal experiences in this neon-lit metropolis reportedly provided some of the inspiration for this movie, and the movie definitely satisfies that backstory.  A very quiet film, many of its most important moments transpire when a single character silently tries to absorb this fantastic place, and simply comes up short.  Whether its a shot out over the city from a high motel window, or up from the streets to the gigantic neon advertisements, the viewer perpetually shrinks to insignificance in the face of Tokyo's sheer mass. <br /> <br />Bill Murray plays Bob Harris, an actor's whose cinematic successes and his ambition are behind him, in town to shoot a booze commercial for $2 million.  He is saddled with a bevy of Japanese \\"handlers\\" at his hotel who are over-eager to assist him, and his attempts to work with his Japanese-speaking director are priceless (needless to say, Harris speaks no Japanese and doesn't want to make the effort to learn). Murray may have been cast perfectly in his world-famous comedies like \\"Caddyshack\\" and \\"Stripes,\\" but he was born to play Bob.  Murray radiates fatigue, and his tired eyes reveal a soul that could find the humor in his ridiculous situation but is just too drained to make the effort.  His repeated phone calls home to his distant wife fail to recharge his soul, and if anything, create a bigger burden to bear.  Bob is truly a man too weighted down by his choices to pursue his dreams any longer.   <br /> <br />Charlotte (Scarlett Johannson, in another shockingly good performance) is in many respects Bob's alter ego.  Charlotte's obtuse, insensitive husband John (a great supporting performance by Giovanni Ribisi) is a photographer in Tokyo for a shoot, and Charlotte has tagged along.  John, eager to make it in the entertainment biz, quickly abandons Charlotte, and she is cast adrift in the enormity of Tokyo.  But as a 25-year old Yale graduate, she is intelligent enough to know that she should be doing more but is perhaps too young to know what her life's ambition should be.  In her own way, Charlotte is as adrift as Bob, but she bears the burden of cautious inexperience.   <br /> <br />These two lost souls meet in the chic hotel bar.  Bob is attracted to Charlotte's beauty and innocent wit, while Charlotte is drawn to this man of charm and obvious experience.  Soon they are exploring both Tokyo and each other, both through their conversations and their mutual ability to inspire the good things in each other.  Romance is obviously kindling between them, but both also put on the brakes . . . out of a combined sense of propriety -- both are married after all -- and also a sense that this relationship is too important for a tumble in the sack.   <br /> <br />Eventually, the movie builds to its much-discussed climax, a whispered assertion that will have you leaning forward in your seat as you strain to hear what is actually said.  This entirely unexpected ending is one of the most romantic and hopeful moments you will ever see on screen.   <br /> <br />If you have ever complained that all Hollywood is interested in is big-budget star-driven shoot-em-ups that spend more effort on their stunts than their dialogue, this movie is a perfect antidote.  While it's doubtful that \\"Lost in Translation\\" will create a tourist boom for Tokyo, the movie is also made with an obvious affection for the big Japanese city, and that in its own way is touching as well. <br /> <br />A must for the film library! <br /> <br />
B00063EMJ6|5.0|Well folks I think it is time I weighed in on the subject of Neil Young selling out by putting out a \\"Greatest Hits\\" album/CD. I am old by some of your standards I am sure. I am a product of the sixties so I have had the oppurtunity to listen to some great music and musicians when rock and roll was early in it's birth. It was not like today when the studio takes over and overdubs and removes mistakes. It was alive, fresh, and creative. But I am getting away from the purpose of the review...I agree that if you have not had the oppurtunity to listen to much of Neil Young's music that this is a good purchase. It will let the new listener hear some of his music without purchasing all the albums or CD's to cover all the tracks...Personally  I own all of the albums or CD's that cover the \\"Greatist Hits\\" tracks so I will not be getting it...in fact since I don't listen to the albums much any more all the albums I have I also have on CD. But remember I have been accumulating this over the last almost 40 years. I have listened to Neil Young from his days with Buffalo Springfield to CSNY and all of his solo career...he is great alone with a guitar and harmonica and shines with \\"Crazy Horse\\" behind him...Neil would never sell out...and if you disagree then buy his biogaphy \\"Shakey\\". Neil Young is one of the last true rock and rollers that are left. He says in his biography that he would rather bury all this recordings and let someone else do a greatist hits when he is dead. By the way he owns all the original recordings he has ever done all the way back to Buffalo Springfield. Now everybody has a opinion so I in no way am I out to offend anyone but I think that if you want to talk about selling out then go buy a Brittney Spears CD..do you really think anyone would care to listen or watch her if she dressed out at 275lbs. I think to determine if someone is really selling out you should first look at whether they have a record label behind them or an entire marketing machine...like Ms. Spears. It's nice eye candy for sure but she has no talent..and there are many others out there so I am not picking on her believe me...Anyway for those who buy this recording enjoy and have a ball...then go buy \\"Live Rust\\" and \\"Unplugged\\" and compare the versions of \\"Like a Hurricane\\". Sorry folks I am just a die hard fan for Mr. Young...Keep on Rocking Neil...
B0002OERI0|5.0|The only reason I bought the CD was because of the review Howard Stern gave it one morning.  I've always dismissed Green Day as a Clash wannabe.  As such, I never bought anything of theirs (I played The Clash non-stop in college...how could anyone do it better than them?).  Man was I wrong!  I picked up the CD 4 weeks ago and haven't listened to anything since.  So for any NON-Green Day fans out there, GET IT!  Best album of 2004 by far. <br /> <br />Now.....I'm off to buy \\"Warning\\".....
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|This album is a good album, but I believe that it is overhyped. If you read in many of the music magazines, they will highly praise FRANZ FERDINAND.  I think that it is being over praised.  While this is a strong album and has a lot of good things going for it, it still has many flaws and also, there have been better albums out this year specifically that outclass FRANZ FERDINAND.<br /><br />First, the positive aspects of this album.  I like the way that this album reopens a vintage seventies sound.  The simplicity of the guitar arrangement reminds me of The Beatles.  Sometimes simplicity is a very positive thing. In this case it is.  If you compare this to say guitar heavy ALTER BRIDGE (even though both are different genres of rock), you will find yourself highly praising the simplicity of the guitars here.  Also, the bass line is a positive going back to the thumping bass line of pop and of R&B where bass is of prominent importance.  Bass was obvious on every track. The trend of this prominent bass line is obvious also in the Scissor Sisters album of the same name.  To touch on it again, another positive aspect of FRANZ FERDINAND is the use of 70s sounds.  The 70s sounds sound vintage, yet they sound fresh.  For those above things, Franz Ferdinand deserves praise for FRANZ FERDINAND.<br /><br />The negative things, which many critics seem to surprisingly over look are also prominent. The production of FRANZ FERDINAND is a little iffy to my ears.  The guitars & bass & drums sound ok, but the lead vocalist is often overshadowed by the arrangement.  Also, constantly throughout the CD it seems like the peak of the recording is exceeded, meaning the arrangement as a whole is too loud, despite the vocalist being under the arrangement.  Essentially, I think that recording would have been better had it been recorded/produced better. Compare it to other rock, pop, R&B, country, or gospel recording of 2004 and you will hear the difference between their sound quality and the sound quality of FRANZ FERDINAND.  Also, the lead vocalist and the backup vocalists aren't the best vocalists I've ever heard.  They are ok, but they don't inspire me particularly on any song.  Production-wise, \\"TAKE ME OUT\\" is the most polished vocal & production work of FRANZ FERDINAND.<br /><br />My top songs are as already stated \\"TAKE ME OUT\\" as well as the puzzling gay-love song \\"MICHAEL\\", \\"TELL HER TONIGHT\\", and \\"THE DARK OF THE MATINEE\\".  I do recommend this album, but I must destroy the idea that this is the best album of 2004 because there are much better offerings out there than FRANZ FERDINAND in the same genre of music as well as the pop, punk, country, hip-hop, and R&B world.  3 1/2 stars.the sound quality of FRANZ FERDINAND.

B00000GAIW|5.0|I have owned this classic album on vinyl ,tape and now c.d. it is without doubt a wonderful and unique musical experience and certainly one of the top 20 albums of all time.I applaud all the American kids that saw the wonder and enjoyed the freshness of Ian Andersons compositions and revelled in Martin Barres rich guitar work, instead of jumping on the Jesus bandwagon and castigating the songs before delving into what Anderson was talking about. There was nothing similar to this before and there has been nothing like it since , it never grows old , a true sign of greatness.Funny thing was it came out at the same time as another gem , Tea for the Tillerman by Cat Stevens and these albums were a great joy to me when I  was a green 20 yr old working in the wilderness. Enjoy.
B00005JM02|5.0|This is a movie about a fish that gets lost and kidnapped and his father adventure to find him, while Nemo (the lost kidnapped fish) tries to escape as well. It's a great movie...funny, great graphics and an all together great film. Totally recommend.
630529142X|4.0|To this day, this is still my favorite Adam Sandler movie.  Here we find him playing the misfit in a comedic analogue to \\"Rudy\\".  Kathy Bates gives a great performance of the Southern Louisiana Cajun sterotype.  There are many quotable lines such as, \\"You can do it!\\" and \\"Mama says that alligators are ornery because they got all them teeth and no toothbrush.\\"  It follows the standard formula, if you will, of most Adam Sandler movies:  The plot moves along the happy path for about 2/3 of the movie.  Then there is a crisis followed by resolution and a happy ending.  It's not rocket science, but it works well.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I'm not a person that listens a lot of heavy music but I have to say that Slipknot is an excelent band that know how to attract people's attention. Their masks and overoles are totally awesome and their previous CDs were great but belive me that none as this. I think there are two ways in wich slpiknot \\"fans\\" can describe this album: <br />1) The fans that only like this band for making very but very hard music are saying that this is a horrible album that slipknot are not kick-ass as they were before, etc. <br />2) The really fans of slipknot are going to accept that slipknot has made a more \\"mature\\" and \\"better produced\\" album and that as real fans they have to continue suporting the band, even if they change, but in this case it was a really good change. <br />This CD still has some energetic and full of anger songs that sound like their previous songs like \\"the blister exists\\" and \\"three nil\\" and it also has two acoustic songs including \\"vermilion pt.2\\". Excelent CD, buy it <br />
B00000DFTG|4.0|What's here is awesome, but Ozzy ruins it all by dropping the F-bomb at least 10 times per track- it's no big deal at first, but wears thin quickly (\\"Come on! Clap your f---ing hands!! You're not f---ing loud enough! I can't f---ing hear you!\\" etc.) If you can get past that, it's well worth it.
B0006399FS|3.0|Three and a half stars actually. I'm a fan who will never forget \\"The Joshua Tree\\" and \\"Achtung Baby\\". These two albums, especially the first, set the bar...and \\"All that you can't leave behind\\" and \\"...Atomic Bomb...\\" will never rise to the level of that bar. It's different music for sure and it's beautiful, but lots of the fans are just haunted by the magic of the \\"Joshua\\" and \\"Achtung\\" albums. A friend of mine said about \\"Atomic Bomb\\": \\"It's good music, but it's not U2, it's Duran Duran\\". Well, it's not Duran Duran either, but I get his point. Lots of fans listen with \\"Joshua\\" and \\"Achtung\\" in the back of their minds. That's what defined U2 for them. And therefore \\"Atomic Bomb\\", although filled with good music, will never get five stars.
B0001Z53AQ|2.0|wassup d12 yall makin it seem like yall need eminem to live cuz thw minute eminem get off the album yall soundin bad.  devils night was a banger it was very good.  this is i dont know man. im not feelin them right now and im not feelin eminem right now either.  theres always room for improvement.

6304076517|5.0|Prospero's Books is an artful, elegant, beautiful film with the richness and texture of gorgeous human flesh.  It has a dreamlike quality, rather like listening to the Shakespeare play while dozing off and dreaming semi-erotic images and bizarre imagery. The whole film has the feel of a rennaisance painting in motion with decorative nudes that are just there but not really part of the action or the story.   <br /> <br />I don't think this film was intended to be a literal portrayal of Shakespeare's play \\"The Tempest\\", rather it was intended to be a dreamlike artistic rendition.  There are plenty of artistic liberties taken with the play which I can forgive because of the elegant and highly original portrayal of the play. <br /> <br />I, like many other reviewers in this forum have stated, wish that this would come out on DVD to obtain the full aspect ratio of the film.  Much detail is probably being lost on the edges of the picture. <br /> <br />I often think of \\"Prospero's Books\\" as \\"Caligula\\" lite.  Though made by different people, they have many of the same qualities -- lots of beautiful human flesh and a dreamlike quality, although \\"Caligula\\" is much more violent and has explicit sexuality which does not appear in \\"Prospero's Books.\\" <br /> <br />If you want a very literal portrayal of Shakespeare's \\"The Tempest\\" I would recommend going to your local Shakespeare play house, but if you want something offbeat, with sensuousness and  just a little bit of sensuality then you will like this film.
B00005JLSE|5.0|...And that's just Catherine! As for the rest of the movie, it's simply scrumptious.  The dance numbers, especially \\"All That Jazz\\" and \\"Cell Block Tango\\" are incredible.  Costumes are lush and gorgeous.  Numbers are staged dazzlingly.  The acting is top-notch.  In today's age, the lesson rings true.  If anything, this movie can and probably will usher in a new age of movie musical, started with Moulin Rouge (which, by the way, is not superior to this movie if only due to the comparison of the crackling dialogue of Chicago and the trite, sappy dialogue of Moulin Rouge).  If you haven't seen this movie, where have you been? WATCH IT! If only to see the perfection that is Catherine.
0792844882|5.0|The choreography and dance sequences in this movie are awesome!! <br /> <br />And I love watching gorgeous nude and semi-nude human bodies in motion.  And there are some great provocative scenes in this movie. <br /> <br />The story is a little corny and unbelievable.  For example there is this scene in the very beginning of the movie where this big brute of a guy gets a little fresh with the heroine of this story, Naomi and she scares him off with a switchblade.  In real life, that big burly guy would have made her eat that switchblade!  She should have been packing a .45 Smith and Wesson.  There are some other unlikely events in the story, too. <br />She is supposed to have been running the streets and hitchhiking.  But she is too beautiful to have been living that kind of life!  Real women that have been living a hard life like Naomi is supposed to have look like they have been living a hard life -- they resemble Charlize Theron in the movie \\"Monster\\". <br /> <br />Ah! But this is Hollywood!  (or rather, Las Vegas) <br /> <br />Oh well, despite its faults, the movie shines in its dance choreography and eroticism. <br /> <br />At the end, Verhoeven gets up on his soap box and asks the question, \\"What would you do for fame?\\"  \\"Would you do anything to get to the top?\\"  I guess with all the sensuality and striptease, he has to throw in a little moral to the story.
B0000E64ZB|4.0|This is a good album by Carla Bruni.  I was surprised to hear that she was a supermodel, I had no idea.  Her voice is very sensual and she accomplishes the atmosphere that she seems to want to create.  The music and lyrics are well crafted and tastfuly composed.  Nothing fancy, just good tunes.  Most of the songs are in the same key however, and the album can begin to sound monotonous.  The highlights are \\"Quelqu'Un M'a Dit\\" , and track 6...I can't remember the name.  If you like Aimee Mann, you will enjoy this album....
B000002B7O|4.0|This is an excellent album simply because of the amazing guitar work done by Randy Rhoads.  I'll never forget hearing \\"Over the Mountain\\" for the first time; the solo simply blew me away.  Me and my friends loved this song so much that we performed it in the obligatory 80's college air guitar contest; \\"our\\" Ozzy bit the head off the Easter Bunny during the performance.  Seriously, Randy's dedication to his instrument truly shines on this album and his classical training comes through in a way that will have you playing your favorite tracks over and over; it gives this heavy metal album a true \\"uniqueness.\\"  It would be easy to criticize Ozzy for all of his satanic references, etc., but I ask you to listen to this album solely for the guitar work.  You won't be disappointed.  Based on this album alone, I would put Mr. Rhoads on my list of the Top Ten Guitarists of All Time.
B0002TT0NW|3.0|I really looked forward to this movie, but the changes in it really bothered me. I didn't like the change in scenery, it was way too different from the first two movies, and makes you wonder why they moved Hogwarts? I also didn't like the new Dumbledore.. the actor just doesn't portray the wisdom of the character. The time turning sequence at the end was boring. I really think the first two movies were directed much better. Granted, this one has good effects, but the plot and changes really take away from it.
B00008H2LB|3.0|First off, I'll talk about their first cd, hybrid theory. A great cd with heavy riffs, strong vocals and great sounds. They were my favorite band. I am not a fan of rap/hip-hop at all(i like metal), and even with their genre, hybrid theory was terrific and made me enjoy they're style of rap and rock together. When I got Meteora, I was expecting the same thing, but I was disappointed. Mostly because this album was missing what the first had. The first cd got your attention with incredible originality and good sounds, but the new songs are all the same thing. Some are heavier than others, some are more singing, some are less (a lot are less) and some have more dj effects, etc. But besides minor differences, the cd is so repetitive. The songs I have found to be good though are Faint, Figure.09, and Numb. These songs deserve as good of a rating as Hybrid Theory. Some of the other songs are just plain stupid. Linkin Park is still a great band, although I think they need less rap and more guitar riffs like theyre old stuff and more songs like Crawling, In the End, and One Step Closer. The CD is okay, but if you liked Hybrid Theory like I liked it, and the \\"older\\" Linkin Park(i know they only have 2 albums) then you may be disappointed.
B00005JMEW|4.0|This is the first Q.T. movie I have ever seen, and I wasn't enthusiastic about seeing it from its previews, but I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, it's got a lot of blood and gore and it isn't very realistic- the bride would have had to pull a lot more out than an IV if she had been in a come for four years- but the fight scenes are good, and the showdown at the house of blue leaves is fantastic. I loved Gogo's character and also Lucy Liu's portrayal of O-Ren. And the last fight scene between the bride and O-Ren was done very well.. the lightly falling snow and the beautiful Japanese garden really added to it. I've watched it many times and still am hooked. If you can enjoy a quirky movie that isn't supposed to be realistic, you will like this one. Don't buy it if you have a habit of taking movies too seriously.
B000696PWC|4.0|As of this moment, this is without a doubt the definitive Kylie Minogue singles collection. They're all here (though I would have expected \\"Your Disco Needs You\\" because of its Australian success, and I still think Kylie missed an opportunity when she didn't release \\"I Feel For You,\\" the best song off of the Body Language cd, as a single), plus 2 new ones which are destined to become hit singles in their own right, because they are absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />My only complaint is this stinkin' \\"Copy Control.\\" While I agree that they have the right to do what they can to prevent people from illegally recreating and selling music, I'm frustrated that I cannot put this music on my computer for my own personal use. I mostly want to have the two new songs seperate, as I like to burn for myself CDs that collect B-sides and rarities so they're all in one place. I wish they did not use this Copy Control technology to prevent me from doing this.<br /><br />Regardless, this is a great introduction to Kylie, and makes a good case for the argument that her 80s work was a cut above the rest of its ilk after all and that her 90s and 00s work is the best dance pop - well, ever.
B00004Z400|5.0|i got this a while ago and i still cant get enough of the song \\"elite\\" really really good album!! id recomend to anyone whos into hard rock, its probably not for the people who would like yellowcard for instance!
1576751988|4.0|\\"Eat That Frog\\" by Brian Tracy is an excellent book about creating habits to stop procrastination. This easy to read book gives 21 pieces of advice to stop putting off the things that really need to be done and just do them.<br /><br />I found a lot of these examples repeated from his book, \\"Million Dollar Habits\\" but repeatition is sometimes needed to learn some techniques.  Additionally the layout in this book is much better so I highly recommend this book also.<br /><br />The mostly focuses on the importance of setting goals, planning and attacking the big tasks from a piece by piece mindset.  While I found this advice relevent and helpful, I would have liked some examples, especially in the planning part of the book.  However there are plenty of other books out there on that topic and examples were probably left out to keep the size of the book small and easy to reread.<br /><br />In all, definitely a great book and worth reading.  I give it 4 out of 5 stars.
B00006RINF|4.0|this is quite a good album and cristina does have really quite a good voice. th album is sorta let down in parts by the guy backing her, in some cases its not THAT bad. <br />i orignaly bought this album cuz i had heard their song \\"swamped\\" and couldnt get it outa my head... so i got this home and stuck it in my cd player and i have to say that i was sort of dissappointed at first but i thought that it was probably one of those cds that you have to listen to a few times to totaly get into them, so thats what i did and it did grow on me. i havent listened to it since the summer there so maybe ive forgotten parts of it but id still recommend it to ne one, they are nothing like evanescence btw! but, yeh, id recomend it! <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|Hi all Star Wars fans of the world, this is supposed to be the ultimate edition of the Star Wars Trilogy video collection but just 1 minor dissatisfaction, the CGI featured made some of the scenes look so artificial especially Jabba the Hutt in Episode IV: A New Hope. I prefer the old conventional effects - just plain puppets & scale models. Congratulation to Lucas Team for bringing us another great Star Wars Trilogy video format. I got mind before Christmas (shared the shipping cost with an old friend & still shrinkwrapped in plastic) & go get yours before they run out of stock or increase in price. Thank you Amazon Team, you guys have the most reasonable DVD prices & very efficient shipping but too bad no international toys shipment. Cheers. May the Force be with you.
B00006L3LD|5.0|im gonna keep this short - BRILLIANT, ABSOLUTLY BRILLIANT!! has summer written all over it!!
B0002X314C|5.0|I first began paying attention to John Legend when I heard his song, \\"Stay With You\\" playing on UPN's \\"Kevin Hill\\" with Taye Diggs and INSTANTLY fell in love with the song and the voice!! I searched the internet for days trying to find out who was the man whose voice gave me goosebumps with just one verse. I finally found him and the song on his website, johnlegend.com and bought his album \\"Live from the Knitting Factory\\". I have been anxiously awaiting this cd ever since and I was NOT disappointed when I bought it last night!! <br /> <br />John Legend has that soulful voice that takes you back to the Marvin Gaye, Teddy Pendegrass, Donny Hathaway days. I am a true romantic and have been missing the true love songs that we have not really heard since Luther.  John Legend provides that and more with songs like \\"Stay With You\\", \\"So High\\", \\"Refuge (When it's Cold Outside)\\" and \\"Get Lifted Again\\". I can not wait for his next CD to drop. Kanye gave us all a gift when he brought us John Legend. If you have not gotten this CD yet, ya better hurry up. You are depriving yourself of REAL Soul Music, because john Legend's music touches your soul and your heart.
B00028HBKM|1.0|I thought the movie was long, bloody, and boring.  Since I am a devout Christian, I didn't see this movie as anything but what it was, a MOVIE.  It wasn't a religious experience.  Just a bunch of actors being misdirected by Mel Gibson.  I watched the movie for about an hour and walked out.
B0002X314C|5.0|this is an excellent CD! I couldn't get enough of it. John's musical style is so unique and refreshing. I look forward to the next one.
B00006RU5B|4.0|It was a strong and steady album, but there was nothing that really stood out on this album.  Some songs were good , for example like a stone was good, but there wasnt much else.
B00005U2LM|5.0|In the Hood-10 <br />Rules-10 <br />Chrome Wheels-9 <br />Soul Power-10 <br />Uzi(pinky ring)-10 <br />One of these days-9 <br />Yall been warned-10 <br />Babies-10 <br />Radioactive-8 <br />Back in the Game-9 <br />Iron Flag-10 <br />Dashing-8 <br /> <br />Very tight album overall.

B000007XUQ|5.0|This double CD is the release to buy so you will have ALL of the wonderful Carpenters Christmas music. This contains both of their original Christmas albums in their entirety -- \\"Christmas Portrait\\" and \\"An Old Fashioned Christmas.\\"  The other Carpenters Christmas CD available is a single disc called \\"Christmas Portrait - Special Edition\\" and, although it includes all of the songs from the original \\"Christmas Portrait\\" album, it does not contain all the songs from the second Christmas album, \\"An Old Fashioned Christmas.\\" For just a few dollars more you should buy this double CD and have everything. Timeless, beautiful music!
B000002KDX|5.0|Listening to this cd is almost like listening to MTV's UNPLUGGED.  GERRY BECKLEY(his voice reminds me of JOHN DENVER), DEWEY BURNELL (his voice reminds me of STEPHEN STILLS), and DAN PEEK(my favorite singer in the band) are excellent singers, songwriters, and lead guitar players; furthermore, GERRY and DAN are also bass guitar and piano players.  The three-part harmony that is very similar to CROSBY STILLS NASH AND YOUNG is an important element for this group.  The three hit songs from this album are excellent.  I also love the arrangements of  RIVERSIDE, CHILDREN and DAN PEEK's RAINY DAY (featuring a pedal steel guitar) and NEVER FOUND THE TIME (featuring DAN on the piano), which I love to play on my 12-string acoustic guitar because it relaxes me.  The 12-string guitar on these and others give their music a refreshing and relaxing sound.  THREE ROSES, CLARICE and DONKEY JAW are also great; however, PIGEON SONG is my least favorite song.  Unfortunately, the sound of the piano played by GERRY on I NEED YOU does not sound like a grand acoustic piano, but it is still a excellent piano ballad.  I happen to enjoy hearing the dual lead guitar from both DEWEY and DAN on SANDMAN, along with the dual lead guitar from GERRY and DAN.  More,importantly, the sound of the MARTIN acoustic guitars that they use on this album and others to come give their music a crystal-clear and rewarding sound that is so refreshing.  Overall, this one of the best albums by America from 1971-1975.  In my musical opinion, forgot HISTORY GREATEST HITS and buy the first five AMERICA cds because they are all outstanding albums and definitely worth having.
B0006399FS|5.0|I have been a U2 fan since 1980 and this rates as one of their better discs. I am reading all this crap from other reviewers that the band is washed up or they have sold out. Neither is true. EVERY BAND that has more than one great disc is labled a \\"sell out\\" because they didn't repeat the same stuff over and over. I own every U2 disc and some imports and this is not a copy of any other disc. To the newer listeners my advise is this: whenever a band survives over a long period of years there will have to be direction changes in the music so it is not boring to the artist or the listener. Whenever this happens there will be a long list of \\"fans\\" that claim the new stuff is no good. Also, the music written by 20 something year olds will not be the same as the band reaches their 40's. (the Stones fans and now Green Day fans have said the same kind of stuff). U2 is back to a more raw rock sound while still keeping the tradition of strong ballads. The band seems to have a renewed passion for the things that made them great while not totally playing it safe. As a frequent traveler to Europe and especially Ireland, this disc is very in touch with that part of the world. Just look at the Amazon sites from EU countries and you will see a strong difference in the reviews. In the world of J-LO and Britney and boy bands, its nice to still hear the emotion and energy that comes from a real band.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Wow, not only has the greatest television show ever finally started rolling out on DVD, but it seems the folks at NBC and Castle Rock really care about this project. This contains hours upon hours of extras. The documentary on disc 4 is the same as the NBC reunion special, but its an expanded version. All of the episodes contain \\"notes about nothing\\", which are basically like subtitles only the notes are tidbits about the episode or series. So even the episodes section of the DVD gives you more than simply the episodes you see on syndication. Thats besides the fact that they are slightly longer and in high definition. Many of them are accompanied by inside look videos, intros and deleted scenes as well. This is a spectacular start for a DVD rollout of a spectacular TV series.
B000002HEP|5.0|This is metal slowly brewed to a thick and sludgy perfection. Kyuss are at the top of their game with this first rate metal record. This is heavy metal done Black Sabbath style, slow and heavy and very hard. The boys also show their gift for psychedelic instrumentals, most notable on Asteroid. Imagine a stoner metal version of Miles Davis's Bitches Brew and your almost there. Most people these days will listen to this record due to the fact that the now popular Queens of the Stone Age has found an audience. Kyuss was Josh Homme's(the Queen's leadsinger and guitarist)first notable band in which he had all guitar duties while John Garcia handled vocals. I personally prefer Homme's classy vocals to Garcia's typical heavy metal growl but with a fine record like this, thats only a minor flaw. Anyways if you love your metal slow and heavy and swirling with a psychedelic sheen than this is a must own.
B0002X314C|4.0|On the first listen, I was lukewarm to this disc. But then, i found myself singing the hooks and humming the rythmns. The more i listen to it, the more i love it. The melodic chord changes, strong harmonies, and bouncing grooves, all amount to an energetic, high-quality CD. Yeah, the lyrics are trite and no new topical territory is delved, but hey, it's R&B -- what do you expect!?!?
B00069YDXU|4.0|I was fortunate enough to have been stationed in Germany in 1997...and to have seen this show a mere week prior to this Montreaux performance.  I may be looking back with rose -colored glasses, but it seemed as if The Boys were a bit more relaxed when I saw them in Kassel...possibly they were more conscious of the cameras darting in and around them at Montreau?  It's still a good show, and I too must take exception to the \\"one-star\\" reviewer above: technically, the video is crystal clear, and the audio, while not being a perfect mix, is very good.  I guess there were a few more bum notes than I remember from the Kassel performance, and Greg flubs a couple of lyrics.  But this has always been part of ELPs' charm!  There's a \\"rogue\\" aspect to this band that has always appealed to me.  I've always been suspicious of how Perfect those Yes and Pink Floyd concert videos have always been...they're sterile to the point of being somewhat boring after a while.  Not the case with these guys!  You never know just what is coming next.  These guys are not as fast or \\"on top of their game\\" as they used to be  ( and I saw them twice during the 1977 Works tour ), but this is definitely worth the modest price.  Now if only the Holy Grail of ELP footage will come out:  California Jam from 1974.  Amazon, better order a LOT of that one...you won't be able to keep it in stock.
B00030590I|4.0|One of the more intellectual films out there that tries to make you think about peace, war, and consequences.  Base on a chinese folktale, this is a thoughtful story filled with plot, character, imagery, and action.  Not overly dramatic like most kung fu movie genre, but smart.  Zhang's use of colors is artistic, and the kung fu movements are acrobatic.  Why this did not get a 5 is because the ending leaves you unsatisfied - i.e.  Hero should have been less tragic.
B000002TQV|1.0|Apparently the same one that hyped up Jimi Hendrix and the Lord of the Rings, because I just don't get this nasal whiney music. My friend has been trying so hard to get me to like these guys, forcing me to listen to all of their incomprehensible albums. You might say, \\"Well you just don't get it, man\\". Get what? I gave it the good old college try, and it just wasn't there. Tip: If you want to be really hip and edgy, add a bunch of Radiohead CD's to your collection. Most Radiohead fans are not all bad, they just caved into the pressure of \\"everyone else\\". \\"Well, I don't get it, but everyone else seems to get it so I'll buy some radiohead so I can get laid by a chick with dirty faded jeans\\". I don't dislike radiohead because I like to be different than everyone else, I dislike them because they are truly talentless (...). It sounds like a guy WHINING to his best friend about breaking up with his girlfriend drowned out by 12 year olds practicing on their guitars and drums at band class. What a waste of sound.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|The bonus material alone are worth the price of the set!  The six-part documentary details development of this film from its inspiration by a magazine article to its premiere and everything in between.  There's plenty of \\"how they did that\\" along with lots of behind-the scenes secrets.  Fans of the filmmaking process will enjoy it.
B00005A3KS|4.0|My husband and I have watched this about 20 times.  The direction in this movie is fantastic.  The cutting, the pacing, sweep you along.  It's got one of the best chase scenes ever filmed.  Unlike many others reviewers, we both think Keanu is pretty bad, but it really doesn't matter.  He's a rubber ducky swept along on the waves.  Swayze is much better (and he did most of his own surfing too).  Gary Busey is wonderful.  Lori Petti is the best of all, a really interesting character, and just burning up with intensity.  The surfing scenes are exhilarating, and the sky diving made me, your basic coward, want to go jump out a plane.  If I'd been told the plot before I'd seen the movie, I'd probably have avoided it.  As it turns out, I love the whole masked presidents bank robbers stuff.  Seeing Regan in the gas tank scene is almost worth the whole movie.  This is a must see movie for all thriller and action fans.
0930289234|5.0|i think this book is amazing. it makes me happy. i am about to read the last issue now. it is super good. i am trying to get this girl i know to read it. you should read it too.<br /><br />EDIT-- update.<br /><br />the girl i knew never read it, and she was in a car accident and died. i miss her a lot.
0767834739|3.0|I thought this movie was ok.  I have never played the games, butI greatly enjoyed the first Resident Evil and I think this one was just as good.  I enjoyed the ethical issues pertaining to Umbrella's cover up stories, etc, and I think it had a lot to offer besides a \\"bunch of good guys killing zombies\\".  I also enjoyed Milla Jovovich in this film.  Is she Oscar-worthy?  Well, no, but if you're looking for an Oscar contender, this isn't Titanic, ok?  I forget that she basically has had zero movies and, from being a supermodel to an actress, I think she's doing a pretty good job.  Plus, how awesome is it that she's a girl and kicks so much butt? <br />    I definitely think this movie was worth renting.  In my opinion, it's not a waste of time.  I also, on a side note, thought 28 Days Later sucked in a big way, and the Resident Evil movies were much better.  How is 28 Days Later going to completely rip off Resident Evil and then call itself original?  At any rate, I don't think you'll be disappointed with this film.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Disney really reclaims itslef with Mulan. After the disturbing sexual innuedoes in the Hunchback of ND, Mulan brings a strong self of character to Mulan. Mulan takes her fathers place in the Chinese army and in the process disguises herself as a man. The switch proves to be both hilarious but shows the strength and love Mulan feels for her family. The dragon (voiced by Eddie Murphy) injects even more humor and choas in this delightful tale. In addition, the colorful backdrop of China's countryside and villages weaves a comfortable blanket around this story in which to enjoy. In Mulan, Disney has created a character were young girls can find independance and heart.
B00005JNEI|3.0|If you had the money to make a movie about something that really makes you angry, would you be of sound mind and objective opinion to do it fairly and equaly?  This is a question that everyone should ask themselves before watching (or even after watching) Fahrenheit 9/11.  Realistically Michael Moore is a blowhard; an extremely left wing French culture loving, untrusting soul who is obviously has a beef with any Conservative politician, George Bush in particular.  In essence, I feel sorry for him that he is not able to take a realistic look at the world around us and see why some things are happening.    Obviously, I am not a Michael Moore fan, however I am not a Bush fan either.  I accept that he is our President and it is my right to say that I think he has made many mistakes in his first term.  History will tell us if his next term is redeeming or damning.  However, Moore is a man who is lucky enough to make movies where he can shuffle is opinion to everyone with a mix of fact and a large dose of innuendo.  Listen to this movie CAREFULLY!  Many statements Moore delivers are simply questions, questions with no answers but his innuendo pushes the element of conspiracy and hidden agendas.      I don't believe the first scene with the woman who's son was killed in Iraq is true.  I think that's way too expedient for him to find a staunch Republican who is so in favor of Bush to suddenly do a 180 and question the administration...just within the time he was making his movie.  Hmm, that's awfully convenient.    There are many questions that Moore states in his movie that I WOULD like answers to; why were the Bin Laden's flown out of the country under secretive circumstances.  Why did Haliburton get a multi billion dollar no-bid contract?  Why, to this day, have we concentrated so much effort on Iraq when Bin Laden is in Afghanistan?  Why didn't the members of Congress read the Patriot act before voting on it?      The movie is fairly entertaining, but a little too long.I won't debate the true facts of the movie, of which there aren't many.  I was aware of almost all the truths displayed, but when Moore delivers them with a self righteous, pompous, all-knowing attitude, I don't feel compelled to listen.  I am objective and I ask questions, I don't like jumping to conclusions.  Moore has jumped to many of these and this why I not only do not like him, I don't consider him to be a professional.
1400032717|5.0|A fantastic, well-written story, told in an oddly appealing deadpan style. I am deeply moved. The accuracy of the book to actual autistics is not something I can guarantee, but so far it seems pretty credible. Deeply memorable. A must-have.
B00028HBKM|5.0|In a powerful rapture of graphic storytelling, Mel Gibson's vision of Christ's last hours on earth is shocking, disturbing and strangely uplifting in some ways.  Shot in remote locations that are very similar to the harsh countryside of the supposed location of the crucifixion, the movie looks authentic with just a bit of Hollywood drama. <br /> <br />The Passion is a tough movie to watch.  It pains you with brutal scenes of torture inflicted on Christ as he is persecuted for his claims of being the King of the Jews and the Son of God.  The anti-Semitic allegations really aren't warranted.  I mean, c'mon, if he hadn't been accused of being a Blasphemer, then he would not have sacrificed himself.  The high priests feared the coming of Jesus because it meant that he could tell the people the truth, truth that they didn't want people to know.  They didn't want a mad man to fill the people's heads with fantasy, nor did they want to true son of God to make them realize what was really happening.  In short, they would lose their place and stature as religious leaders.  THAT is simply human nature.  If Christ showed up today I have no doubt many Christians would doubt his authenticity.  I don't think God faults us for our weaknesses and fears, so I don't believe in the end the religious leaders would suffer divine persecution. <br /> <br />Back to the movie though, it is not just a religious revival of the death of Jesus.  It is a story, one that many people already know so a lot of structural detail is left out.  Mel Gibson instead focuses on interesting aspects, mostly in flashbacks, that you may not expect, particularly the mother and son relationship between Jesus and Mary.  With such heavy influence on Mary and her struggle with watching her son's death, this is definitely a Catholic's perspective (Gibson is a devout Catholic).  But there is nothing wrong with this, it adds a very emotional impact.  The lack of focus on Mary Magdelan is strange though.  The one scenethat flashes back to her stoning and Christ rescuing her from that torture is short and actually puts Christ in a heroic light.  Once again, nothing wrong with this.  It gives him a strong presence as if to say `anything that happens to him happens because he wishes it to happen'.  One very good dramatic element is the struggle of Pontius Pilate to not have Christ killed.  It is one of the best character conflictions of the story.  Pilate tries very hard to keep this man, who may simply be delusional, from being convicted by a very angry crowd.  He doesn't want an uprising, but he doesn't want to kill someone out of the crowd's sheer hate.  His final decision to release an insane and homicidal criminal is a last ditch effort to avoid the inevitable.  Other than displaying beyond human endurance, there isn't much in the way of performance that Jim Caviezel can do.  But he still plays the part well where he can.  There is an especially good scene with his mother where he is displaying his skills as a carpenter, showing us how he must have spent most of his life making a living.  The opening scene in the garden has him begging his father to not have to go through with the sacrifice, a very human reaction.  Lucifer stands close by trying to convince him that one man cannot save the entire human race.  The action of killing the snake released by Lucifer is extremely symbolic and again puts Christ in a heroes light.   <br /> <br />The production value of this movie is very good.  The cinematography is stark and realistic, but again a bit Hollywood.  Being forced to read the translations can be tiring, I think some line did not have to be translated and the point could have been understood.  Kudos should be given all around to the actors for learning what they had to of the dead Aramaic language.  The CGI effects are very good, blended seamlessly with Jim Caviezel as he is whipped with an array of weapons.  It adds a tension building element that makes you cringe and has you telling the purveyors of the beating to stop.  One might even question if Christ could have remained conscious throughout the experience, being that he was in human form.  But that is potentially a much greater argument.  With all the hype that led up to this movie, I expected it to be more graphic.  But as an avid movie goer, I didn't find it any worse then some horror movies.  But it was more realistic obviously as to what would happen to a man if these atrocities were inflicted on him.  Thankfully Mel adds a resurrection scene at the end to lighten the darkness, I wish this scene had been a little longer.  I highly recommend the movie, not only as a powerful tragedy, but as an emotional drama that can affect anyone, no matter what religion, if they watch it for what it is; a man who sacrifices himself for the greater good of humanity. <br />
B00005JMYI|4.0|This movie was a pure joy.  Its sidesplitting funny from start to finish.  Will Ferrell is in top form, Christina Applegate is equally as funny, and the whole supporting cast is funnier than 4 seasons of SNL and MadTV combined.  Ron is like a younger Ted Baxter (you know, from the Mary Tyler Moore show) but on acid.  Good ole Ted certainly couldn't have gotten away with things as Ron did.  Great cameos flesh out the movie and are numberous.  This is one dern good movie.  Now, fair warnng:  IF YOU DON'T LIKE TO LAUGH THEN THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR YOU.  More comedies should be this funny.  Kinda braindead but still SO funny!  Sit back, relax and DON'T think so much.  Enjoy...
B00061QJZI|3.0|This movie was hard pressed for laughs. I just didn't like the humor but why if I disliked it would I give 3 stars? The extras. We are talking over 35 minutes of blooper and deleted scenes, many funnier than the movie itself. If you are a Wil Ferrell fan and want to see a good movie, get \\"Elf\\". If you are one of those that get dvd's for all the extras, then by all means, pick it up.
B00005RG6B|1.0|After reading all the great reviews of this dvd I decided to get it, but I wish I hadn`t. This is not a review of Queensryche or their music, I love both, but the reviewers forgot to say that the entire dvd is put together with cut-shots.  This makes watching the concert more like watching a 90 minute music video instead of a cohesive live show. <br /> <br />The camera cuts to different shots every 3 to 4 seconds for the entire dvd.  It will give you a headache after a song or two.  If you want to see Mindcrime performed live I suggest you get a bootleg of the show instead of wasting money on this dvd.  I should have know with Wayne Isham directing it that the dvd would be shot the way it was, but I took a chance anyway and I lost.  Stay far away from anything Wayne Isham directs if you are like me and can`t stand watching a concert of nothing but cut-shots. <br /> <br />Also just to let any of you know who may be interested in it, Iron Maiden`s \\"Rock In Rio\\" DVD is shot the same way as this dvd is.  It is unwatchable and a great show was ruined by cut-shots.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|This is a MUST for any DVD collection - a wonderful family film packed with the best bonus features I've seen to date. Everything from the set design/visual effects, to casting, and songwriting is superb. You can really feel the love and effort that was put into the making of this movie. And the bonus features help to show that in-depth. I highly recommend purchasing the accompanying 40th anniversary edition of the soundtrack CD as well which also has snippets of radio interviews by the cast/book author/songwriters.
B0006284JQ|4.0|When I first heard that Britney Spears was releasing a Greatest Hits, I thought she was crazy. But then I realized -- she's been around for more then 5 years now, and has had 4 full LP's which contain a slew of hits. This album displays her growth as both an artist and as a person in the last few years...and boy has she come a long way! From the sweet \\"..Baby One More Time\\" to the ultra sexy \\"Slave 4 U\\". The album contains all her hits, well except \\"From the Bottem of My Broken Heart\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\", but honestly, the album is not missing anything without those tracks.  <br /> <br />My Prerogative - I actually really like her version, and the song in general. It has a Bollywood-Bhangra beat which I like. Very reminiscint to her latest full LP, \\"In the Zone\\", with Rishi Rich's remix on there and also several other indian inspired tracks. 4/5 <br /> <br />(I've Just Began) Having My Fun - Even though this song was super populaire on the downloads, I'm not really feeling it. It's alright. 3/5 <br /> <br />Do Somthin' - This is another song I can't figure out why people love so much. Its ok, once again. 3/5 <br /> <br />I felt that as far as unreleased material goes, the two tracks that she released with the \\"In The Zone\\" DVD were much better. The P.Diddy produced \\"The Answer\\" , a good up tempo R&B/Hip Hop track, as well as \\"Don't Hang Up\\" which is almost a techno song, but very catchy. <br /> <br />

B0000399WC|4.0|I just saw this movie a few days ago on DVD. I wasn't born yet when this was originally released. I like the Steve McQueen movies I've seen and usually Hoffman's movies as well. I thought this movie was a great example of both of these actors' abilities. It's not an uplifting movie for sure, but gives you some things to think about in life as well as to be grateful for your freedoms. The movie is a little long at 2.5 hours, so don't throw it in if you are looking for something short and light.
B00004YA66|5.0|This review refers to the New Line Plarinum Series DVD edition of \\"Frequency\\"...    I consider a good thriller, one that not only keeps me on the edge of my seat after the first viewing, but one that keeps me there with every viewing. \\"Frequency\\" is one of those, that no matter how often I watch it, it takes it's hold on me from the first frame and won't let go until the last. It's more then just a thriller though. It's some fabulous Sci-Fi entertainment with great special effects, it's the poignant story of a special bond between father and son, and there's lots of heart pounding action sequences as well. Add to that one fabulous cast including Dennis Quaid, Jim Caviezel and Andre Braugher, a fresh take on time travel, and you are in for 2 hours of some fine entertainment.     A Police Officer John Sullivan(Caviezel), by a miracle of nature, is able to contact his father, Frank(Quaid), on an old ham radio. The miracle?...The Northern Lights make a rare appearance in New York. What's truly amazing is that his father died thirty years earlier fighting a fire. He is able to change the course of history, by forewarning his father about the tragedy to come. But by changing the course of history, John and Frank may have unleashed an evil chain of events yet to come. They most work together, with the time they have to stop a serial killer.    The DVD is a great buy. The transfer is gorgeuos. A wonderful widescreen presentation that takes in all the action and special effects in brillant colors. It made be viewed with DD5.1 Surround, which brings it all right into your living room, and it also has an option for DD2.0. A ton of features include deleted scenes, a documentary, \\"The Science and Technology Behind Frequency\\", Commentary, you can isolate the score, and much more(see buying info for complete list of extras). There are subtitles in English, and the snap case unfolds to some production notes and a few scenes from the film. You really get more bang for your buck withthis great package.     It's a film that will have your heart racing one moment and the next will evoke a lump in your throat at the touching moments. It's got something for everyone. It's rated PG-13, but parents may want to view it before hand, as some of the scenes are quite violent.    It's A Definate Keeper!....Get the popcorn ready and enjoy...Laurie     also recommended:(see my reviews for details)  [[ASIN:079390532X Die Hard Trilogy Letterbox Edition]]  [[ASIN:B001DI8ZDC L.A.

0802130208|5.0|I was annoyed at this book when I first started to read because it reminded me of all the over polished knee-jerk, over educated, liberal type pros that usually gain the Pulitzer Prize.  But once I picked the book up again I found myself amazed that the book won that horrible prize. <br /> <br /> Most of the negative reviews about this book seem to come from people who have personal issues with some of the characters in the book.  Well guess what, if you hated Ignatus, if you felt bad for the mother, if you thought the tittle wasn't deserved then the author did his job because this is what he intended.  I thought it was brillant and funny.  And the only thing this book might have to do with the Simpson is perhaps that Ignitus reminds one of the fat guy who sells comic books in the comic book store.  I think it was beautifully written with amazing details.  I thought the use of his vocabulary was stellar.  I received a vivid portrait of New Orleans and a wonderful glimpse into the relationship between a son and an over protective mother.  The only negative comment I can make about this book is that the ending seemed to come too fast, but it ended fine and I did not feel cheated.  I wish the author was around to reap the rewards of such hard work.  I can't imagine why the editor at Simon and Schuster who stalled the publication of this book did so.  Maybe it wouldn't have sold well at the time.
0451196716|5.0|The Long Walk story essentially revolves around an endurance race between 100 boys, each one representing a different part of the United States, willingly contending in an annual race were the participants had to keep walking until they couldn't go on and then be eliminated one by one until the last one standing was declared the winner. The interesting thing about the race is that each eliminated boy is shot on the spot by armed guards.<br /><br />Stephen King masterfully describes the whole ordeal that these kids have to go trough in detail. He manages to take the simplest of ideas and make a complex and hard to put down story. Stephen King never really gives any solid background history about why this horrific ritual takes place, or what kind of sick world these youths live in, but what he does is give hints that that let you figure a lot of information by yourself. That manages to make the story all the more dark and enjoyable.<br /><br />Although this is not King's best written book, it is by far the one book written by him that managed to keep me on the edge of my seat until the very end. A must read for any Stephen King fan.
B0002DRDBE|5.0|Clerks is awesome.  I was laghing almost the whole time.  They should have had more of Jay and Silent Bob.  They were still way better in this than in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.  Although that was HILARIOUS, too.  The movie reminded me of Seinfeld, in the since that it was about pretty much nothing.  It was just people standing around talking.  But it was hilarious.  The ultimate slacker's movie.  ONly if your not offended easyily.
0887306101|5.0|The interviews conducted by Jack Schwager more than a decade ago and publish in this remarkable book are still as relevant today as ever. Jack Schwager takes us inside the mind of some of the top market players of our era. The book is extremely enjoyable to read and clearly shows that although it is very hard to make money trough investing in the markets, with hard work and determination it is possible.<br /><br />Some of the players mentioned in this book are still around today, while others have move on to other things. It is true that some of these speculators were institutional or \\"inside\\" investors, but you will still learn a lot from their experiences.  The great thing about these extraordinary people is that each had their own unique approach that worked for them, and none of them were followers.<br /><br />You will learn the importance of creating your own individual trading system in order to be able to actually make money in the markets, and of course each interview is filled with tons of ideas and real life stories that will help you develop your own individual identity. Some of the stories are amazing and you WILL learn a lot from them.<br /><br />There are heaps of books out there that promise to make you rich overnight by following their simple systems, but the greater part of them just don't work. On the contrary, this book will truly help you get a grip on what really takes to make it in this hard business. It is very simple and fun to read, and don't be fooled by the year it was published because like I said before it is still extremely relevant today. If you are researching books on trading, then please buy this book, and read it carefully. You will not regret it.
B00003CWOL|4.0|THis movie is really funny, especially for religious people.  Sure, it makes fun of the Catholic Church, and it even suggsts cnspiracy in the church.  Alot of it doesn't make any sense, like God is trapped in a body?  He's GOD.  He can do whatever He wants!  Don't get me wrong I did like it!  A little out there, but still very funny.  Again remember it wasn't suppose to match up with the Bible.  Like God is not a woman, God is genderless, and Jesus wasn't black, He was Jewish etc.  But you what?  It's a Jay and Silent Bob movie, OK?  Don't overanalyze it.  Good for those ont sensative to the issure of religion.

B00000250H|5.0|First I must say that this CD will always be special to me, as it introduced me to Janis Joplin. I would like to point out that most of Janis' best songs are not featured here. I would really recommend buying \\"The Essential Janis Joplin\\". However, this album is an excellent place to start.    What I love most about Janis on this album is her signature raspy vocals, unleashed raw energy and the real true gem of this record, is the live version of \\"Ball And Chain\\".(Which is one of my VERY favorite songs of hers).    One cannot deny the power and substance of such stellar tracks here such as \\"Piece Of My Heart\\", \\"Me And Bobby McGee\\" and \\"Move Over\\". Another exciting highlight on this greatest hits compilation would be Janis' cover of the Gershwin classic \\"Summertime\\".    Overall an excellent snapshot of Janis and the music of the late 60's.
B0006A9FMI|5.0|I'm a non american citizen, that make me a part of the \\"rest of the world\\", and i want to tell something: If I want to hear TRISTAN UND ISOLDE, I really want to hear it in german, if I want to read RIMBAUD's poems I really want to do it in french. I LOVE SUBTITLES, because that gives to me the posibility to feel the real inflexions, the creator's original vision and gives me chance to avoid the censorship and the silly decisions of some occidental producers (if you love anime, you're gonna remember the uncomprehensible decision to give a grown old \\"whisky-tongue\\" man voice to \\"yiyi\\", the child-voice fragile pet  of Kiki in Ghibli's \\"Kiki's delivery service\\").<br /><br />Ghost in the Shell 2 is a piece of art...in japanese. Who wants Gillian anderson playing Mononoke?
B000002H97|5.0|One of the most thought over albums Metallica has ever created, is  Metallica(aka The Black Album). The Black Album really has two sides of it, the eighties side, and the newer side, we could almost call this album a bridge.  <br /> <br />This album is probably closest to Reload, although The Black Album is one of my favorite albums by Metallica and Reload is one of my least favorite Metallica albums. Therefore we could say that the two albums relate mostly in genre, than in song. Although some people may question this considering maybe if htey saw that on the Black Album there is a song called Unforgiven and on Reload there is a song called Unforgiven II. Although these two songs are somewhat similar, there is alot more difference between the two, so we could maybe call them cousins, but we could definitely not call them brothers, or sisters.  <br /> <br />As I said before the Black Album is like a bridge between the two sides of Metallica, the old, and the new. So I am pushed to think that any Metallica fan could enjoy this album, whether you like St. Anger or Kill 'Em All. But this is surprising because I would say The Black Album mostly connects to St. Anger(my least favorite Metallica album) more than Kill 'Em All(my most favorite Metallica album), and I consider the Black Album maybe  my second favorite Metallica album. So I urge you greatly to listen to this album before you purchase it. <br /> <br />Another good thing about this album is that it has many amazing guitar solos by Kirk Hammet. Over the years it seems like there are being less and less of these, so it would be great to hear this album and hear Kirk at his finest
B0002V7ODI|5.0|Late in World War II the Nazis, in a desperate attempt to change the course of the war, conduct a ritual to bring forth a demon from hell that will bring about the end of the world and a new Eden.  U.S. soldiers interrupt the ceremony and the demon is instead brought up by a professor of the paranormal as a monster fighter (along with others of unique backgrounds and gifts).  Sixty years later, those who birthed Hellboy are back for him and the end of the world.<br /><br />I loved this movie!  Loved it!  For anyone who is interested in history and cultural mythology and believes that movies, to some extent, are the telling of old tales in new ways (and some will become tomorrow's myths), \\"Hellboy\\" will definitely keep that belief alive.  Not to mention it's simply just one exciting damn fine fun kick ass movie!  There is not a weak performance (onscreen by actors or offscreen by crew) in this film.  You do not have to be a fan of the comic to enjoy this movie. It's fantastic storytelling mix of family devotion, burgeoning love, acceptance of personal power, overcoming prejudice, sacrifice, with action, comedy, horror, comic book stylized evil and one of the eeriest bad guys ever to weld a knife, as well as one of the most intense (and well dressed) villains to ever threaten the earth.<br /><br />Ron Perlman has the lead and, as in the past, gives the excellent magic of make up artist Rick Baker life.  He takes what would be for most actors stifling full make up and a weighty cumbersome costume and gives the audience a being with the flesh of a demon, the voice of a dark angel, the attitude of a blue collar worker, the humor of a college student, the mind of a professor, the heart of a young man in love, and the soul of a human being.<br /><br />Favorite line:  \\"There are things that go bump in the night Agent Myers, make no mistake about that, and we are the ones who bump back.\\"<br /><br />Favorite line spoken by Ron Perlman (a lot):  \\"Awe, crap.\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend getting both the 2 DVD special edition and the 3 DVD director's cut if only for the different commentaries that director Guillermo Del Toro does for each version (he'll get Best Director/Picture Oscars one day, right along with Best Screenplay, and there should also be a new category created due to his inspiration: Best Commentary).br />I highly recommend getting both the 2 DVD special edition and the 3 DVD director's cut if only for the different commentaries that director Guillermo Del Toro does for each version (he'll get Best Director/Picture Oscars one day, right along with Best Screenplay, and there should also be a new category created due to his inspiration: Best Commentary).
0743454529|2.0|I cannot remember ever being so angry at an author for jerking me around as I was with Jodi Picoult when I got to the end of this book. I was willing to ignore the ridiculous coincidences (such as Julia and Campbell both working on this case--are there only a dozen people in this town?--and Jesse's crimes affecting both Brian and the judge) and overly affected writing because the plot was so engaging. But Picoult's idiotic and gratuitous surprise ending is unforgivable. I can't believe I wasted a day reading this book only to be jerked around at the end.

B00008WT5E|4.0|All the songs kick on this record, but I have to say a few words about \\"Down Payment Blues.\\"  If any fan of rock'n'roll can resist this song, GET THEE TO A PIANO BAR!  THe opening riff is rock 'n'roll, as gripping and ominous as any moment in pop culture - it is like pluggin' a power cord into your spine.  If you play guiter, playing that riff has to be like . . . sex, heroin, sky-diving -  all of the above?  All the rest of the songs are a rush, but I am always waiting to get back around to \\"Down Payment Blues.\\"  That's the only reason this doesn't rate a \\"5.\\"  WARNING: This record is not recommended for play while driving around in a fast car, especially if you have a lot of points on your license.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|I went to see this movie in the theater and I literally laughed out loud every 5 seconds.  It is a must see and definitely worth buying no matter what anyone says.  Go NAPOLEON!
B0002VKZL6|4.0|I give \\"Shangri-La\\" four stars, because I believe there's no such thing as a bad collection of Knopfler music. However, I still believe that \\"Golden Heart\\" is the high mark by which I will always judge the rest of his work, and I doubt if he will ever hit that mark again. \\"Shangri-La\\" certainly displays the same songwriting genius that is evident on past Knopfler collections, but the lack of any real guitar solo work left me wanting a little bit more. As always, his lyrics almost force the listener to paint a vivid mental picture. This CD is no throwaway, for sure, but I'd like to hear Mark's guitar do a little more talking on the next collection.
0316776963|5.0|David Sedaris is a great writer. This autobiographical look at his life makes one take a look at the humor in their own life.  We all have idiosyncracies and personal issues and Sedaris brings them all to the surface in an enjoyable and amusing manner.  I cannot wait to read more!!!!
B000002U82|5.0|Without doubt the most expensive album I have ever bought. Not because of the disk's price tag. But after a single listen I realised my creaky old hi-fi was never going to do this masterpiece any justice.  <br />Despite my girlfriend's protests, I duly parted with a heap of cash for a slick new sound system. Thank you Pink Floyd - you cost me my holiday in Italy that year. My girlfriend never forgave me. <br />Was it worth it? You bet it was.  <br />Dark Side of The Moon is art rock for the masses. It's where Sgt Pepper buys new cloths and recruits a synth player. It's a succinct statement about England and Englishness. It shows Roger Waters actually cares. It's a mermerising melting pot of psychedelia, jazz, rock, blues, clocks and cash tills.  <br />And another thing for all you trivia fans: 'Money' inspired the theme music to the British sitcom 'Are you Being Served'. How's that for passing the baton of English eccentricity?  <br />Buy this album - but check the quality of your hi-fi first. Or you can wave goodbye to your next holiday.           <br />
B00005JNBQ|4.0|i'm one to usually spring for polarizers.  this is to say unintentionally i usually fall for films that have some audacity, that get many people split.  i call these \\"black licorice\\" films.  there's black licorice in everything, though...art, music, people.  a lot of cool smart people will be taken aback by movies i like, and i usually think i'm a cool guy of fair intelligence.  i liked napoleon dynamite, and it appears that many others do, but many also hated it.  i must say that i liked it more than \\"office space\\" and \\"rushmore\\", names that keep poppping up on this list.  the reason being is that there are no \\"speilberg\\" sentiments here as there are even in many fairly ok movies like \\"rushmore.\\"  this is a bleaker yet not mean spirited type of movie.  it's a little bit like the recent scottish movie \\"rat catcher\\", yet not as dark and way more american and retarded.  <br /> i like blank open ended movies that plod along.  they help me relax, because my mind just goes where it goes, perceiving, not being manipulated by musically enhanced hollywood reverent emotions.  \\"napoleon d.\\" does get a little heavy handed with 80s retro, which, while never cloying, makes me slightly leery of MTV's (the producers of this movie)smarmy calculation with the 80s retread phase going about these days(the movie even contains a time machine set for 1982).  but i'm happy to say that even though this is an \\"MTV Film\\", it's not a turd, but pretty great.   <br />there is a very flat feeling to the whole movie, but not in a bad way. it reminded me of herzog's \\"heart of glass\\", where the cast was hypnotized before shooting the rushes.  while not aspiring to ponder profound things like herzog, \\"nap. d.\\" does dish out a lot of atmosphere.  just putting you into a time and place for a few hours.   <br />this is a good movie for people who are chill and don't have a chip on their shoulder and take themselves so seriously that that they run to their computer after they see a movie and flame everyone else for having an opinion contrary to theirs. <br />i like black licorice movies because they inspire thought.  this could have been a typical movie, but i must admit, the teen misfit movie was given a new dimension here and i just recommend that people check it out. <br />incidentally, i went to a rural high school, and i found a lot of the movie to be spot on.  people get pretty quirky when there's nothing to do but drive around back roads and hang out with one's pals etc, not to mention when decent jobs of any kind are far and few between!  the \\"locals\\" are not abused here, but dealt with tenderly.  don't be so sanctimonious....like you've never laughed at trashy white people culture!!   <br />
B000002J09|5.0|New to Led Zep? This is the one studio album where you get the best of everything the band had to offer; where the worlds of blues, rock 'n' roll and pastoral English folk music collide in truly spectacular fashion. <br />Here, Plant and Page pull together all the strands of the first three Zep outings and deliver a sonic behemoth that has stomped all over the album charts for the last 30 odd years.  <br />And deservedly so. From the acoustic whimsy of 'Going to California' to the seismic assault of 'When the Levee Breaks', 'Four' is jammed to the rafters with sublime songs for all rock 'n' roll seasons. 'Black Dog' has enough boogie to shake the tail feathers off a dodo.   <br />Arguably, Zeppelin's creative peak was still to come with 'Physical Grafitti'. But for consistency, this one's hard to beat - it's as big as rock gets.  <br />Oh, and it's got 'Stairway to Heaven' too...
B00005JMAH|3.0|My favorite book of the series, least favorite movie. Still a good movie, but disappointing because it missed the best emotional parts of the novel. The movie neglected to mention that Harry's father was one of the creators of the Maurader's Map, and the special feeling Harry had that when he used it he followed in his father's footsteps. It neglected to mention his father's animagus form, the stag, and in doing so never gave the audience the idea that the stag patronus really came from Harry's father. Harry claimed he thought it was his father, but we the audience had no reason to believe him.  <br />  In the novel, the emotional high of his father's possible appearance was matched only by Harry's mixed sadness/pride he felt when the truth is revealed. Sadness that his father did not appear, and pride that the patronus, his strongest bit of magic in his young life, had taken his father's animagus form. That the movie failed to convey this is inexcusable; it is to this day Rowling's best writing.
B00028HBKM|4.0|OK. I get it.  <br />Jesus really really really suffered.  <br />A lot. <br />Maybe I didn't need to see his skin flayed off in little ribbons by the 'cat-o-nine-tails' whip thing with the hooks on it. <br />This inexorably painful movie shows the whole Jesus, carry-the-cross, crucifixion thing in exquisite detail. <br />It was agony to sit through.  <br />I think that was the intended emotion that Gibson wanted to evoke. <br />However competently it was done (and this is an amazing looking and sounding film), the horrific scenes...one after another...are revolting, nauseating, wince-inducing and will make the skin crawl.  <br />I watch a lot of movies...all kinds including horror/exploitation-type flicks...and this is the closest I've ever come to turning away from the screen. <br />I also think you have to know a little bit about the story beforehand. This is not for the Christian novice. <br />Many characters are never identified by name, and certain scenes are depicted in almost cinematic shorthand...when you see the feet of Jesus in an empty courtyard, with a few dozen rocks strewn about and the hand of a woman reaching for Jesus...you are supposed to know the whole thing about the adulteress, the \\"ye without sin\\" casting stones, etc.  <br />My take on the material was in noting that this is a story of the ultimate religious persecution. Here is the person with the \\"ultimate\\" religious conviction. He does not only believe in the Son of God and the Messiah, he believes he IS said person. <br />For those beliefs, he clearly suffers the \\"ultimate\\" punishment, and is the victim of the most severe form of religious intolerance. <br />Just my little interpretation. <br />Overall, I felt exhausted and spent by the end of what felt like a four-hour movie. I agree with other reviewers that it's not really a film to like or dislike. <br />It's a five-star production, but in terms of content, I'll never need to see it again.
B000002UDD|4.0|I was only 4 when Dave Mustaine got booted from Metallica and to this day, i'm 26 now, you can't mention the name Megadeth without someone being a smartass and throw dirt at you like you talked about a communist party in the american parlament. Metal fans should unite because we have more in common than what separates us. For the record, Megadeth's music is unique and not a watered down version of Metallica's as some ignorant people put it that have never actually heard a Megadeth song in their life.  <br /> <br />Moving on to the music... <br /> <br />This might be Megadeth's most emotional record. With the band and Dave Mustaine being ever more addicted on drugs it affected the songs he wrote aswell. Some of the lyrics are clearly associated with drug use. <br />Though not as good as the previous record when it comes to arrangements and riffs in my opinion, this album still has many great moments and are more melodic and out there. Kind of spacey, a definite contrast to previous records. <br />The producer put a lot of reverb on the songs to hide all kinds of glitches due to the shape the band members where in when they recorded this album. <br />Probably to heavy drug use by the band members to take this album a step further than Peace Sells but the next album would take care of that anyway...  <br /> <br /> <br />
B00000612P|5.0|Most critics say that this is Rod Stewart's best album, and I'm inclined to agree with them.  It starts with the great \\"Every Picture Tells a Story\\", ends with the superb \\"Reason to Believe\\" and has a bunch of fine songs in between them.  What more need be said?  Highly recommended.

Randy's vocals seem to amaze me everytime i listen to any of their cd's. He is by far my favorite front-man in the music industry. And hes got the best band in it, too. His Vocals have changed from album to album. Each one his vocals get clearer and clearer. On NAG he mastered the death metal screach, on ATPB they got deeper and clearer and you could understand them better. On AOFTW they get even better. There is no one any day that can touch him in the death metal growl/scream. Not only does this cd have amazing vocal, but the guitars and drums are incradible. The guitars are really displayed well in the instrumental song ashes of the wake. It's is a good song for Lamb of god's guitarists to show off what they've got. Every song on this cd is way over my expectations for any metal band out there, but u can't expect anything less from Lamb of god because they are just better than anything else out there. And where did they find their drummer????? All the other metal bands (except Fear Factory) should be jealous! Overall this cd is the best LOG cd and the best of 2004 with a close second from Shadows Fall. BUY IT NOW!
B000001F7E|5.0|Most critics say that this is Rod Stewart's best album, and I'm inclined to agree with them.  It starts with the great \\"Every Picture Tells a Story\\", ends with the superb \\"Reason to Believe\\" and has a bunch of fine songs in between them.  What more need be said?  Highly recommended.
B00005JN4O|5.0|Director Marc Forster's \\"Finding Neverland\\" is a truly charming, moving, and powerful biographic film of Peter Pan writer J.M. Barrie, played impressively by the great Johnny Depp.  Though \\"Finding Neverland\\" does take some liberties in the life of Barrie, for the most part, the film is entirely factual, which makes the tragic story even more affecting.  Balancing tear-jerking sentimentality with moments of childlike (and I mean \\"childlike\\" in the bets possible way) delight and warm humor, Forster has created a nearly flawless film that can be enjoyed on many different levels by young and old alike.   <br /> <br />My whole family went to see \\"Finding Neverland\\" the day before Christmas Eve and we all left the theater teary-eyed yet utterly satisfied with what we all consider to be one of the best films of the year.  Though it never actually mentions the holidays, \\"Finding Neverland\\" is the perfect holiday film as it embodies many of the ideas associated with the season: the ability to retain childlike optimism and hope, the notion that people are essentially good if you trust and encourage them, and the faith that a life after death will reunite believers. <br /> <br />Johnny Depp's giddy sense of childlike glee and innocence is so incredibly genuine that it really brings the audience into the world of Barrie. Depp's brilliant performance helps us to understand Barrie's eccentric person by remaining sweet and rueful while suggesting unseen emotional depths.  It is also fascinating to see the reason behind the common theme of many of Barrie's plays; seeking in art a happiness we cannot sustain in life. <br />
B0002XDODU|4.0|For everyone sayings its different its because it is. They wanted to try new sounds. They got some inspirationg from metallica, system of a down, and Slipnot. Still a good cd. Amerika is one of the best music videos ever made I think.
B000002C4J|5.0|Hmmm. Celine Dion and lengthy list of collaborators from different genres of the music spectrum is what this album promises to listeners. What we get is something that has diverse and creative stamped across it and we get the bonus perc of hearing Mrs Dion tear it up and be the power diva she is. <br /> <br />\\"Reason\\" is great. carole King provides back up vocals for this song and her smokey vocals accent Dions nicely. (note: Dion sings backup on this song for Kings album, which came out shortly after this one) <br /> <br />\\"Immortality\\" The Bee Gee's offer their vocals, yet they do not stand so tall beside the power horse of singing loud. Still, when they sing together, it produces a nice, overall effect. <br /> <br />\\"Treat Her Like A Lady\\" features not only Diana King, the phenominal artist who sang \\"Shy Guy\\" for Bad Boys, but also Brownstone offering their rousing gospel tinged vocals to make this one of the meatier dance songs to hit the pop scene. Celine does great getting down... <br /> <br />\\"Why Oh Why\\" has Toni Brazton all over it and she does a wonderful job singing it in such a sultry mode. <br /> <br />\\"Tell Him\\" is a lovely duet with Striesand, but the song is a bit over rated. Pretty, but over rated.  <br /> <br />\\"Where Is The Love\\" is my favorite song on this album. Cory Hart wrote it for her and it is the most poetic song on this disc. Also, Cory Hart opened her concert for her and he is alos a good singe. These two need to do a duet. <br /> <br />\\"Us\\" well, if anyone wondered how Celine Dion would sound doing country, this song offers a close indication. She sings this song so beautifully... and it has such a powerful message. <br /> <br />The rest of the songs on this album are great as well, just not as mentionable as these. She does a duet with Pavorotti and while their voices are great together, the song does them an injustice. The use of the childrens chorus on the title track adds a nice touch to an album that could very well be played withthe children at home without worry of obcenity.  <br /> <br />Overall, this is her best album to date. I love her newer albums, but not even \\"One Heart\\" can measure up to the callibre of this CD. This is the one that should have won the Grammy!!!
B0006399FS|1.0|Having grown up with U2 I couldn't wait to hear the new CD and was soooo dissapointed once I listened to it. Aside from Vertigo, the songs are flat and lack any of the spark found in albums such as Boy and Joshua Tree-a total let down. The perpetual rhyming in the songs leaves me with the idea that U2 should perhaps pursue writing children's tunes as they have mellowed out and gained some middle aged spread. Perhaps they should stick to doing good in the world and hang up the microphone and guitars. Spend the money on Tsunami relief instead.
B00028HBKM|1.0|Blood!  Gore!  Violence!  Mel Gibson obviously has his hand all over this movie, fer sure.  But what about the subject matter?  Gee.  When I want to know what the truth is about the last moments of my lord Jesus Christ, I'll read the Bible.  Hollywood doesn't do it for me and I won't put gold coin in their pockets.
B00025ETIW|5.0|but this is truly one of the greatest albums, especially in regard to more recent releases.  I tried to be skeptical when I was listening to it first time around, and I think that's why I love it as much as I do.  It's so hauntingly amazing that I just have to listen to it.  Haven't stopped since I bought it Christmas day.  It's very raw and emotional.  Its lyrics may be somewhat graphic (depending on what you're used to), but they're really quite visionary.  It's rare now to come upon a CD with this much integrity.  'You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison' is probably my favourite out of the thirteen tracks.  However every song has something unique about it that hits the listener and makes an impact - that is if you really listen to it.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|Another reviewer saved me from a terrible mistake. I've learned that soundtracks often leave out some of the best music from the films and I was afraid this would happen on the Love Actually CD. Another reviewer noted that the UK version has all the music, especially the love themes that I most wanted, whereas the US and Asian version do not. Couldn't find the UK version in US stores, but found it on the Amazon.com.uk site. Price was reasonable even with shipping from UK and it arrived very quickly. CD is great. Only disappointment, as noted by others is replacing Pointer Sisters' version of JUmp.
0553801546|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  It's beauty is overwhelming, and it never leaves you feeling cheated.  I won't say anymore, as I don't want to ruin anything.  You would be remiss not to read this book.
B0002X314C|4.0|\\"Get Lifted\\" is a success by much more than a nose. While we have heard this brand of neo-soul before, John Legend brings a successful, soulful concoction of those who have come before. Many have come before him, following in the footsteps of neo-soul vanguards Erykah Badu and D'Angelo and none have surpassed what those two have created. And John Legend is yet another in the line that includes Ali, Rahsaan Patterson, Van Hunt, Tony Rich Project, Rachid, Jaheim and others -- and at times, he presents elements reminiscent of their styles (check out his raspy, deep renderings that remind one of, most recently, Jaheim) and also that of neo-soul prince D'Angelo's. (Check out the D'Angelo-style wails he lets out from time to time).  Many of those artists fell short of their goals because while they sounded experimental and adventurous, they seemed to be focused more on style, not soul. And even here, there are times when either Legend or his producers are not sure whether to glide soulfully and gracefully or present some bumping, rap-style edge (primarily tracks 1 through 7), and that's where you can see/hear the wheels churning, almost presenting an artificial/contrived feel. But those are small quibbles on an otherwise great album. It starts with great fire, soulful vocalizing, (yet with commercial beats over the first half) and while the works of Rahsaan Patterson and Rachid felt comfortable riding the same type of groove/style all the way through, seems John Legend is more concerned with making older-style soul than making funky/catchy songs you can bump in your car. And that's both the blessing and the curse of this album. A blessing because he strays from the usual path (even though most of his song topics are typical of R&B), and a curse because you sense here's a talented artist that's likely going to fall off the radar because his sales won't match that of, say, Britney Spears and other pop junk stars. He won't be the first, nor the last. Many talented artists have released one album (or maybe two) and then disappeared (Nicole Renee anyone?) due to the industry's obsession with sales over substance and quality. <br />This album nears perfection because of its second half - once the commercial obligations and big-name guest spots of the first half are out of the way, Legend seems to really tap into who he is as an artist/individual. The CD goes gospel with mostly Legend and his piano or some acoustic guitar - while it doesn't give you the chills that D'Angelo's gospel renderings do, it's definitely a deep breath of fresh air in the current music climate. And at times, he almost reaches the gospelly/acoustic heights of Chocolate Genius' soulfully painful lyrics and aching vocals (most close on \\"Stay With You\\"). The concessions to the pop audience aside, this CD is simply incredible, and tracks 8 through 14 are nothing short of wondrous. Those tracks bring soul back to a time before hip-hop influenced soul (back to the 70s to be exact, when the likes of Donnie Hathaway were in the spotlight). And \\"Get Lifted\\" gets you back to bare, almost naked soulful ramblings - and you don't hear that on just anyone's album. If not for the first, more commercial half, this would be a 5 stars. So Get Lifted now, you won't regret this purchase, and as the artificial stars of the flavor-of-the-weeks in your CD collection fade quickly away, you'll find yourself playing \\"Get Lifted\\" over and over, like older generations would wear down their favorite records, until they were scratchy, dusty and crackling... but still sounded soooo good... and that's how the latter half of \\"Get Lifted\\" sounds.
158799190X|5.0|In plain English, Taleb manages to synthesize two vastly different ideas:  That the markets are a random walk that can not be adequately predicted, and that people are irrational and suffer from numerous decision biases.  It is rare for the two to meet, but without resorting to complex math, Taleb explains how both exist. <br /> <br />Based on his background, one would think this is a book primarily about trading.  Quite the contrary, the concept that \\"People underestimate the importance of randomness\\" is also used to explain how poor performers can get promoted.  Taleb also explains how \\"black swans\\" (extreme random events) can be underestimated by even the best mathematical models. <br /> <br />There are knocks on the writer perhaps having a self serving bias, or being a little too confident of his own achievements.  I'll take that any day of the week for an insightful book that improves my professional and personal thinking.   <br /> <br />Do give it a read.

B00005JMJ4|1.0|I find it fascinating how everyone who extols this thing for all of its apparent virtues and strengths as a so-called film is at a complete loss for words when asked to explain why it is so significant.  From film professors to avid movie-goers to soccer-moms; everyone who feels as though this movie deserves all the accolades it has received simply cannot put into words the reasons why.  Just read all the reviews here; \\"If you don't understand it, you never will\\" or \\"you aren't old enough\\" or my favorite \\"you're not intelligent enough.\\"  All tag-lines of the truly mystified.  Perhaps there is such as thing as \\"too intelligent\\" then... <br /> <br />It's fascinating because this movie is so bad, so boring, so hopelessly bereft of plot, character, or any kind of story, that those watching are duped.  It's the banal effect, where something is so mind-numbing it reminds them of having to read Shakespeare in high school, or being forced to go to the symphony by a date or spouse.  If it's banal, it must be high-minded and sophisticated.  Nothing can be further from the truth; and this film couldn't be further from greatness. <br />
B00000J7EI|5.0|The Gallery  and the Mind's I are two of the great death metal albums of all time. DT is the band that got me  hooked to Swedish death metal scene. I now enjoy At the Gates, In Flames and many many more. <br />Highly reccomended
B0001VTPWM|3.0|If I were to review each movie individually: Robocop 1 would get 5 stars for the sci-fi story line and the use of comedy. Robocop 2 was a good attempt to recapture the fun in the first movie but falls short with the moral drum beating about the sins of drugs. Robocop 2 gets 4 stars. Robocop 3 is why I called this review - one movie too many.  This movie at best is only a 2 star movie. That is why I give the box set only a 3. If it would have left the third movie out and instead gave a disc of more special features, this could have been easily a 5 star set
B000002GJ7|5.0|Being a Freshmen in High School when this came out, there were so many reasons why I liked this record at the time (1990) There was \\" More Than Words\\" that my girlfriend loved because it was on the radio all the time. Hole Hearted, that even my parents could like. Get the Funk Out that had the multi diversity. A few head banging hits, but more importantly a slew of songs that are just damn good. If anything, i'd compare Extreme on this record to the Great Queen albums of the Mid 70's. Great guitar work ala Brian May and a singer with a strong voice that can do just about any style. Plus a rythme section that was extremly under rated.             This disc had it all. Jazz, big band, metal, rock, pop, funk, rap...ect. Extreme was a hard rock / metal band, but music is music and there is more here than just about any other album I can think of. Turn it on and turn it up!
B00064MW6A|1.0|Not because it was badly written. Not because the acting was sub-sub-sub-par. Not because the special effects were weaker than my old N64s. Because they took what was, at best, a supporting character in the Batman mythology and ran in completely the wrong direction with it. What was so wrong with keeping the character a loveable thief? People love anti-heroes. or did you think portraying a black woman with extraordinary gifts stealing would be misinterpreted? Not if you balanced the human drama right. Selena Kyle will always be Catwoman. She was a hooker in her youth, a thief as an adult... but she took care of those around her and saved people from the worse elements that lurk in Gotham City. Now to the general audience she's simply a bad joke. Way to go, D.C. and Warner. No wonder the geeks were screaming when you started production.
B0000013GT|5.0|ATLiens by Outkast is a classic, what can I say that hasant been said before? Some of the best lyrics I've ever heard, backed with some serious beats. The flow is sick along with the beats, each song on this album is a must listen. My favorite tracks are; <br />Wheelz of Steel <br />Millennium <br />Ova Da Wudz <br />This album is a must have for the hip hop fan and for the outkast fan

B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is one of the best bands out here, though not because of Fallen. Before you begin to falsly label Evanescence as some sh*tty Lacuna Coil rip-off, listen to their old stuff. Btw, they came out the same time as LC (around 1998) in EPs, so STOP saying LC is older.  <br /> <br />Their old stuff is brilliant. Listen to Give Unto Me, Exodus, Anywhere, Field of Innocence and any other Evanescence songs from Origin or their EPs.  <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, Fallen is a great CD, but Bring Me To Life made Evanescence look bad. It's a good song, but Evanescence is so much better. <br /> <br />Also, Evanescence is not a cheap goth band. They're not even goth. They're a more classical-rock.  <br /> <br />Amy Lee has one of the best voices I've heard, live and on CD.
B00004VVNB|5.0|\\"Logan's Run\\" remains one of my favorite childhood experiences. My Dad and I tried to recall whether we'd first seen it in the theater together, and I believe we did.  <br /> <br />At the time, \\"Logan's Run\\" was a technical masterpiece, being one of the last great science-fiction movies pre-Star Wars. Viewed now, being used to more modern technology, the sets are almost laughable. Models look very much like models, though \\"Logan's Run\\" can boast of being the first film to utilize laser holography (one of the reasons the film won a special achievement Academy award). <br /> <br />The story fits right in with the film's 70s appeal. A post-apocalyptic (what type of apocalypse isn't relevant..or mentioned) city where the inhabitants live a life of idleness and hedonism, until they turn 30. Then it's forced lights out. <br /> <br />Naturally, some people run rather than walk into a certain death. The Sandmen are there to catch them.  <br /> <br />The acting, for the most part, is very good. The story flows well and is interesting throughout, though a bit cheesy in place. This becomes one of the 70's penultimate films just by virtue of Farrah Fawcett's hair alone.  <br /> <br />There is plenty of kitsch value in \\"Logan's Run\\", but it stands as an excellent film in its own right. A behind the scenes documentary sheds some insight into how director's achieved that futuristic look before computers were powerful enough to aid artistic imagination. <br /> <br />\\"Logan's Run\\" remains a science-fiction classic.
B000002UAU|5.0|This is a great album by the beatles, great music and as always great song writing.  <br /> <br />If you haven't already brought this record I would recommend it no matter what music your into.  <br /> <br />The only negative review on this album is by the guy below whos into Fred Durst and that says it all.
B00005RDSM|4.0|IS THERE A \\"LOST\\" OR \\"STOLEN\\" SCENE DELETED FROM PETER PAN?<br /><br />PLEASE REFER TO THE TWO REVIEWS LISTED BELOW.<br />This brings me to my question: as a kid, I had both a 33 1/3 record with songs from Disney movies and a tall book based on the movie. On the record, there was a song, \\"Do You Believe in Fairies? (Then Clap Your Hands)\\" which was played when Tinkerbell almost died. In the book, Peter gets Wendy and all the children to clap their hands to bring Tinkerbell back to life. I know I'm not dreaming this up - I still have both the record and the book.<br />Both my sister (who's ten years older than I) and myself seem to remember that this was originally in the movie. Can anyone shed some light on this for us?<br /><br />Reviewer:  Did I miss something in watching this version? I seem to recall that when Tinker Bell's light is fading the audience is asked to repeat that \\"I believe in fairies\\" or something to that effect. However, in this version, that portion has been edited out. Peter locates Tinker Bell as her light is fading and we know she is seriously injured and then it simply cuts to the pirate ship and then Peter and Tinker show up just fine with no explanation of how she survived. What gives? Political correctness of an anti-belief in fairy type?<br /><br />WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO THIS PART OF THE STORY? I READ ALL 103 REVIEWS AND somebody suggested that the new DVD had an extra \\"Deleted\\" scean? or storyboard that explained the missing part? any of you out there can confirm this? thanks
B0006A9FMI|4.0|Ghost in the Shell 2 surpasses the first movie in almost every respect.  <br /> <br />The merging of CG and hand drawn animation have come a long way since the first one. Graphically, Innocence is mind blowing. The art itself is worth the price of the DVD. <br /> <br />The musical soundtrack, while reminiscent of the first movie, isn't afraid to pick up the pace during the action sequences. It was an oddity of the first movie. The musical score made it seem as though they were afraid of making it an action movie. Not so with this one. The music is much more appropriate for the moments in Innocence. <br /> <br />The story of the first took me several watchings before I truly understood what was going on and how everything connected. Innocence is much easier to follow. Though still heavily philosophical and prone to tangents, I was still able to follow Innocence with one watch. <br /> <br />My one and only complaint of this movie is that there is no English dub. While I don't mind watching it with sub-titles (I often watch most of my anime with subs), there are still some times I'd like to be able to sit back and listen to the dialogue without worrying about rewinding to pick up something I missed. On DVD format, English dubs are usually just a given. Not having it is lazy on the part of the creators and really hurts the over-all product. <br /> <br />Final Grade: Mind blowing graphics, great musical score and easy to follow story line. I have to take away one and a half star for no English dub. To me it's that critical. Three and a half stars. However, Amazon doesn't account for half-stars. Since everything else is so great, I'll round up. Four stars. If you liked the first one, this is a must get.
6305841861|5.0|Evil Dead II is not a remake, it is a sequel. The first 7 minutes of Evil Dead II is a rehash of the first movie (minus a few characters). If you watch the movies in a row, you can skip the first 7 minutes of ED2 and it will pickup right where the first one left off, with something busting through the cabin right into Ash. Same way the first few minutes of Army of Darkness are a rehash of the last two movie and then it goes right into him getting sucked through the portal, overlaping slightly with the end of Evil Dead II. All 3 movies are great, but as a true fan i'm waiting for a set of all three, hopefully packaged like the Necronomicon Edition of the first movie.
B00005JMYI|1.0|I watched Anchorman with my wife last night for the first time and we both thought the movie was one of the worst movies either of us had seen in years.  It was simply not funny.  We had both been looking forward to it a lot as we're both fans of his SNL stuff as well as the other movies of his we had seen (Elf, Roxbury, etc.).  This movie was plain and simply stupid.  It reminded me of my 4 year old who says \\"poop\\" and thinks its funny.<br /><br />Simply, and sadly, a terrible movie.  This is easily in the bottom 5 of the worst movies I've ever seen.
0441172717|2.0|Having been recommended by friends as a must read in the sci-fi genre, I finished reading the original Dune trilogy, expecting something spectacular. Unfortunately, I found myself disappointed and want my time back :). <br /> <br />Herbert has created a colorful and exotic world. The writing is very detailed. However, I found the series to have too much pretentious babble with little real substance behind it. The first book, Dune, is the best book of series. The second is barely readable. The third one bored me to tears at times. For a classic sci-fi series with real plot twisters (or \\"a feint within a feint within a feint\\" in Herbert's words) and intelligent discussions, read Isaac Asimov's Robot series and Foundation series. For a fantasy series with enticing plots and moving character, read Salvatore's Dark Elf Trilogy. <br />
B00028HBKM|1.0|Yes, Mel Gibson has crucified Jesus and has filled his pockets with gold.  I hear he's fighting to get the Golden Idol too.  When he raises it high I guess the Christians here will bow down before it.  Okay, this review is harsh, but so is Mel Gibson's torturing movie!  I guess those who don't really know the word of God feel more cleansed by going to a movie and crying.  I don't think that's what God or Jesus had in mind.  But the believers here are more than happy to follow Mel.  Sad.
B00005JLK1|2.0|This movie, while not \\"bad\\" is instantly forgetable. In fact, around the time it came to video stores, there were 2 or 3 independent films with similar names and similar covers, with- yes- similar stories put out at the same time. I guess something like that tells you that there's a market for it or at least was. I could see Ghost Rig\\" on the shelf and think it was that one that was a theatrical release instead of this one. Can you tell other shark movies apart from \\"Jaws\\"? Other killers from \\"Scream 1,2,3\\"? That's what I thought.
B0001DI0FI|3.0|The movie consists of detailed scenes on how HMS Surprise goes about capturing HMS Acheron - a larger, better equpipped ship with an equally cunning captain. There are a couple of occassions where HMS Acheron moves in stealthily amidst fog towards HMS Surprise. The movie consists of realitic detailed scenes, verbal sparring amongst the ship mates, execution of camouflage idea that ultimately scored for HMS Surprise, and the lifestyle of a variety of species along the Gallapagos islands where Darwin will later discover his theory of survival.

B0001ZMWQO|2.0|This album has one great track. \\"Take me out\\" is one of the best songs this year, but the rest of the album is almost as badas you'll be able to find this year. The opening is about as far from promising as you can get. \\"Jacqueline\\" is an okay song, but the vocals are so gutbustingly awful that you might just want to turn the CD off right away and take it back to the store immediatly. Maybe that wouldn't be such a bad idea because \\"Tell Her Tonight\\" is about ten times worse. It's okay till this guy starts trying to sing, but he sounds like a dog which is whining really loud. About a minuteand a half through the song, what you are hearing becomes so horrendous that you will vow to never listen to that song again, and for good reason. Don't think I'm telling the truth. Go buy the album and give it onelisten. Then you can review it. Thst one hit of the skip button will take you to \\"Take me out\\" which is great, and compared to the others, is four minutes of complete musical bliss. Unless you hear the entire album, you'll never truly accept how great this song is. \\"The Dark of the Matinee\\" is good as well, and so is \\"Auf Ashse\\", and the band is on a roll, one which is quickly destroyed by \\"Cheating on You\\" which isn't as bad as the others, but once again, the vocals SUCK! \\"This Fire\\" is catchy, but is so repetitive that only a few listens are possible. \\"Darts of Pleasure\\" has some pretty good lyrics, but is has now become evident that someone should hire a new singer. Nothing great. However, if you hated \\"Tell he Tonight\\" then you will enjoy the fact that that horrendous piece of crap, is not the worst track on the album. \\"Michael\\" could be considered \\"The end of the world\\". Its good until the guy starts singing. It's about the gayest piece of \\"noise\\" you will ever hear. It the most awesomely bad song this year. Just turn it off. \\"Come on Home\\" and \\"40 feet\\" are much better, but aren't great, and after \\"Michael\\", I was so frightened that I hardly listened. \\"Take Me Out\\"is a great five star track, but that isn't enough tosave the album from twin 1 star tracks. Two stars is generous. Without \\"Take me Out\\",this album is undoubtedly a 1 star. Save your money and get the track off itunes. There is nothing else here but pain.
B0002X314C|4.0|I'm quite impressed with this album. After two complete listens I have yet to feel a weak cut. This album will definitely receive a lot of play in my car and ipod. My only complaint is that Legend sounds way too much like Carl Thomas. Not only does he sound like Thomas in vocal tone, but he croons like him as well, which doesn't say much for being original. However, this is not to say that Legend doesn't have his own appeal. In fact, this album is much better than Carl's last album. Kanye West produced about half of the 13 selections with some of his best tracks to date.
B00005JLWN|2.0|I found this film to be derivative in every possible way.  It's not a terrible film, but it is not impressive, either.
B00005JMYI|1.0|This movie really sucked.. if you're expecting anything even close to how funny Will Ferrell was in \\"Old School\\" then don't even waste your time watching this ridiculously dumb movie.  It didn't make me laugh.. after the first 10 minutes of it sucking I thought it would get better, but guess what!  It didn't.  I'm not one of those people that hates \\"stupid humor\\".. I thoroughly enjoyed the Austin Powers movies (and let's face it, folks, those are just plain dumb humor too.)  However, \\"Anchorman\\" really sank low... it just plain SUCKED.
B000001ELP|4.0|...then this is one you need to pick up.  Many people wisely believe that this was the band's opus.  Is there a more interesting and advanced concept than a soundtrack for a \\"film\\" that never existed in the first place?  No way.  Would you ever expect such an idea from \\"Rock and Roll All Nite and Party Every Day\\" Kiss?  Who would?  The bottom line is that there is some very good songwriting (albeit with some unispired work as well) mixed in with some really creative sonic landscapes that are very un-Kiss, yet cool.   <br /> <br />I don't think many people (including myself) \\"get it\\" upon the first listen, but give this album a chance, and it will earn a spot in your collection.  It sounds dated, but it's also a good musical snapshot of this pivotal era of Kiss as a band as well as the beginning of the 80's musical influences.
B000001EAQ|5.0|<br />After all that HTDAAB hype and the dissapointing, commercial and boring outcome, this album Pop is an awesome masterpiece. <br />Without a doubt, the most underrated ( even wrongly by the band !! ) U2 album ever. I'm 27 so I remember perfectly well those years. Pop, unlike what seems to be now, was acclaimed by all people, including U2 themselves. It's weird the fact that, having sold more than 9 million copies, having performed their most succesfully tour ever, Pop Mart ( even bigger than the famous Zoo TV ), etc, the band finally have decide to play safe and innocent music just for the charts, grammy and money. I still don't understand why they decided to sell out to that commercial world, by making safe, unexperimental and predictable albums like ATYCLB and HTDAAB. <br />Just Mofo alone is far better than anything both from ATYCLB and HTDAAB. U2 had many things to say, unlike what's happening now. Please is one of the truly best ever U2 songs, as well Staring At The Sun, Gone, Discotheque, etc. Don't listen to \\"new mixes\\" from the failed Best of 1990-2000, listen to original versions instead !!. <br /> <br /> <br />If you want to listen to the exciting and fresh U2, listen to these 90's albums.  <br /> <br />Pop is the longest U2 album, and clearly one of the truly best, because IT'S AN ALBUM, not 11 songs for grammy awards, like ATYCLB and HTDAAB are. It's very dark, deep, different, etc, not the 2000 U2, a band who's just copying themselves trying to sound like \\"classic\\" 80's times. <br />You won't find any U2 album like Pop, because Pop doesn't sound like Zooropa, nor Achtung Baby, etc ( unlike HTDAAB, which clearly sounds like ATYCLB ) Pop itself is a whole new U2 era. <br /> <br />ENJOY IT
0743454529|5.0|I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone. However, I am absolutely appalled by the fact that Ann MacPherson would give away the ending of this incredible book!!<BR>What was this woman thinking, first off?? And secondly, why is her 'give the whole story away' review allowed on amazon.com???????? Rethink and delete her review before she ruins this book for absolutely everyone.<br />Bad call on both her and amazon.com's part.
B0000648WZ|2.0|I've read Heinlein's Starship Troopers.  In that book, the troopers were roughly the equivalent of light tanks packing plenty of firepower.  They could move fast, jump heights or distances with their \\"jump jets\\", and deliver unbelievable firepower from their armored suits.    Not so in this movie.  The troopers are just dumb grunts, on foot, wearing futuristic looking uniforms and helmets, and given a machine gun to fight with.  This is the future with warships that travel to different star systems, but they still arm their troops with machine guns, where it takes hundreds of bullets to kill an enemy \\"bug\\"!  Ugh.  Plus the armor they wear does little good.  Every bug was easily able to punch through it.  That being the case, why wear it?  The troopers were little more than cannon fodder in this movie.  Often I kept yelling out at the screen, to retreat and just nuke the whole darn battlefield.    The movie also had blatant themes of nationalism, gestapo like uniforms for the intelligence officers, etc.  I don't know what kind of message the director was trying to send by this, but it's there.    The movie does earn 2 stars, because the battle scenes are cool looking, although you will quickly realize that the troopers in front always die.  I'm surprised they're notwearing red shirts like in Star Trek.  Also, the movie does have Denise Richards in it, always a plus.
B00005ATQE|5.0|Full Metal Jacket is almost to real.The boot camp scenes with R.Lee Ermey who was a real life drill instructor for the Marines are unbeleivable,the things that he says will make you laugh but know that what is going on on the screen is what really goes on in boot camps maybe not as extreme any more because they cant hit anymore but they yell,they use extreme foul language and crude insults,they break spirits,and they motivate.You may think that R.Lee Ermey gets what he deserves at the end of the first half of the movie but realize that he was just doing what he was supposed to do and the mental torture he puts the recruit(D'nofrio) through he humiliates him,he turns the whole Platoon on him,but thats only to motivate him so don't think the Ermeys charater gets what he deserves because it's all part of the Marine Core training.Now the second half is some of the most unbeleivabley tense,funny,and just horrific scenes of war ever on screen.Now this is a movie that will stick with you especially the first half just beware.Very disturbing,violent,sad,and funny all at the same time hell it's alot like the war itself.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|this was the best and funniest movie i have ever seen. my friends and i were always quoting it! i got the DVD for Christmas and i am always watching it. the napoleon dynamite DVD is one of few DVDs with a GREAT audio commentary. it's really funny and it points out random things that you would've never noticed. by far one of my favorite movies ever!
B00005JNEI|1.0|If you see this film and feel you have been enlightened, you will feel even more enlightened after viewing the documentary  Fahrenhype 911.  The comments made in Fahrenhype by people who were included in Fahrenheit are especially powerful, particularly soldiers and their families. To see one film and not both is to be grossly misinformed.
B000002H6C|5.0|To the ignoramus calling this \\"suicide music\\" - you're an idiot. The only song on this album that really touches upon suicide to a notable degree is \\"One\\", and that certainly doesn't have anything to do with so-called teenage-angst.  <br /> <br />Anyway, this is one of my favourites. In terms of playing Metallica are probably at their best here. What really connects with me is the (obvious) emotion and anger present in this recording. The only thing that takes this down a notch is the production, but it really doesn't bother me that much.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|This is a unique film that is actually a series of stories about relationships. Most are about individuals starting new relationships with a variety of others such as one ending due to death, one struggling marriage, one rebounding from a broken relationship, two shy stand ins makinga film , a young man frantically searching for a physical relationship, a man in love with his best friend's girl, and a mad mature scene stealing rocker who inserts great humor during his seemingly destructive marketing of his rerecording of a former hit as a Christmas song. All the stories are in fractured bits as the movie leaps from one story to another, each one probably has 20 minutes of actual film time that you seem to see in two to four minute bursts, which seem to get longer as each reach their climax at the end. There are three sad stories, two of which seem to rebound but the saddest is a young woman played by Laura Linney who takes tremendous responsibility for her mental health impaired brother while pursuing a handsome yet seemingly socially limited co-worker who cannot contemplate her dedication for her dependent brother. There is a lot of humor interspersed throughout and my favorite story was Hugh Grant playing the Prime Minister trying to refuse the sweet and innocent but earthy charms of a lovely big boned assistant played wonderfully by Martine McCutcheon. The PM story takes a zing at America by posing the President as a creepy, dominating womanizer but since Billy Bob Thornton played it rather creepily, you don't empathize with the character. My favorite single character is the ex-bad boy rocker Billy Mack played very believably by Bill Nighy. His outrageous attempts to promote his song, while also insulting it, and making flippant remarks such as, \\"Kids don't buy drugs.........wait until you are a rock star and they will give them to you for free!\\" are delightfully fun breaks from the other stories.  On the most part, the stories end happily with only one that totally crashes so it is a mostly upbeat entertaining film. The number of great actors playing in this film is stunning, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Colin Firth (with an amazing proposal) Liam Nielsen, beautiful Keira Knightly (hard to believe she was the tom boy in \\"Bend it Like Beckham) and Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean) in two wonderful cameo roles as a dry incredulously proper and proficient jewelry salesman (\\"In the flashest of flash\\"). Interspersed throughout is a great soundtrack with hits from the Pointer sisters, Nora Jones, Kelly Clarkson (soulful), Maroon 5, Otis Redding, Olivia Olson (\\"All I want for Christmas\\" is outstanding and she is 10?), Lynden David Hall (fantastic version of \\"All You Need is Love\\"), Beach Boys (\\"God Only Knows\\", which seems perfect for the ending showcasing those that end on a positive note) and the Billy Mack song \\"Christmas is all Around\\" is a hoot and is actually very entertaining and catchy although its played up as a bit of a farce. Virtually a good romantic comedy interspersed with some touching, sad and real stories but overall leaves you with hope for the few that end with a struggle and happiness for those that make it.lly crashes so it is a mostly upbeat entertaining film.

1591840562|4.0|This is a great book for anyone who's been thinking about starting a business or other venture, but doesn't know how or is too scared to take action.  Guy Kawasaki offers common sense advice in an engaging, very easy to read format.  He provides real world examples of what's worked and what hasn't in the past, even admitting to (very few!) mistakes and misjudgments he himself has made.  While this book isn't for everyone, its organization helps those readers who may only be interested in one aspect of starting a business, such as how to recruit a great workforce.  There's also a handy index which Kawasaki himself touts that may come in handy for those who are more experienced or established.  The book is also full of great quotes and anecdotes that may shape your thinking.
6300183211|4.0|SCARFACE is more than just a modernized excessively violent and profane updating of the Depression era original.  Al Pacino as Tony Montana speaks volumes about the need for people to connect to reach other, even on the most superficial of levels.  Montana is speaking to his best friend Manuel (Stephen Bauer) and tells him, \\"Do you know when you've made it? When you make enough money for people to come to you.  The broads, the cars, the coke, they are just symbols of the money.\\"  To a certain extent, Montana repeats the ages old belief that even if money can't buy love, it can rent it.  The renting of love implies that the possession of material objects is done alone, hence Montana's oft repeated refrain: \\"I don't need nobody.\\"  Those who come to a bad end in this film are usually the same ones who have taken that credo to heart and the audience wastes no tears over their demise, but director Brian DePalma includes two who do come to a bad end not because they embrace that money-oriented philosophy, but because they get too close to those who do.  Both of these are coincidentally enough, the same two who are closest to Tony  Montana, his friend Manuel and his sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).  Each was raised in a glittery age of 'me-first' longings, but both instinctively recognize that true happiness consists in needing others to share a communal life.  For Manuel and for Gina, they reach out across a blood divide that demands that Tony lethally forbid his cronies from forming personal relationships with his family.  The extreme profanity and dozens of well-photographed killings are so stylized that they take on a life of their own and tend to hide the film's moral center, that a life of crime based on the need to possess things rather than on one that requires shared effort is fated to wind up with either getting killed by mafia assassins or by one's best friends.  In either case, SCARFACE makes it clear that in any culture that prizes possessions over people, the result is a glitzy death for one or a tragic death for the other.
B00005JMJG|5.0|This movie was so good that I had my memory erased so I could watch it and enjoy it again for the first time.<br /><br />Seriously, this movie is wonderful. It examines many of the truths in relationships, such as how the things that draw us to a person end up driving us crazy eventually and how we're often attracted to people who have the qualities in abundance that we lack. The movie also examines the complexity of memory and how we as humans natually seek out relationships that challenge us and help us grow, which is why the characters with certain memories erased by choice seem doomed to learn the same lessons they just learned all over again.<br /><br />The only problem I had with this movie was that it would be impossible to erase the memory of one person completely. You couldn't erase all of the associations you have with someone you've dated over 2 years, of course, as you are going to run into their mother/father/sister/friend/neighbour, etc. eventually and when they ask you how you're doing and you don't know at all who all these people are, you would start to think perhaps you have Alzheimer's or wonder why it is that some people out there in the world know an awful lot about you and you don't know them at all...plus the insert of \\"Patrick\\" in the film shows the dangers involved in someone having all this knowledge of you and you not knowing them.<br /><br />The acting and the way this film is designed is beyond amazing. Both Jim Carey, as Joel, and Kate Winslet as Clementine gave incredible performances. I really loved this movie and the messages it conveys. Clementine and Joel were complex and complicated people and the writing, directing, and producing was an example of a collection of creative geniuses in full force.
B000067J1H|5.0|I recently rented this movie, after reading the book numerous times. I love the book. I love the style of writing, the political satires, the dark imagery, the characters... everything. One of my favorite books to date. The film, to my delight, followed the novel very closely, and took many direct lines from it. There were a few slight changes for the sake of smooth story telling, and there's the fact that the movie has a completely different ending for the same reason. Overall, the movie is fantastic with amazing acting jobs and great imagery. The book is definately worth reading, and if you have yet to watch this film, I recommend picking up a copy of \\"Fight Club\\" the novel as well. If nothing else, read it for the interesting end, and the sharp, witty writing of Chuck P. You won't be dissapointed.
B00000G3I2|5.0|A satellite tv review recently had this synopsis for The Big Chill. It read:A group of friends reunite for a funeral, play records, drink, and talk. This is pretty much what unfolds in the film which is a lot like Return of the Seacaucus Seven that was made earlier(a fine film shot in 16 mm!) It is this cast that makes the film. I cannot imagine another group of actors who could pull this one off. I think that the Big Chill is one of those rare films that may not seem like much, but with the right cast and some fine writing it is superb on all levels. Some of the best scenes in the film involve the scenes where the group drinks, plays records, smokes pot(courtesy of William Hurt's character) and talks. I think it is easy to see why the flashback scenes were cut from the final print. By not seeing what Alex looked like, other than his forehead and stitched-up writsts in the casket, we are really able to visualize Alex better in the context of his surviving hippie cohorts. Some of the key dialouge involves the words of the minister during the opening funeral scene(\\"Where did Alex's hope go?\\"), and that is the theme which perpetuates through the context of this film. The musical score is wonderful and includes Three Dog Night, Marvin Gaye, The Rolling Stones, and The Beach Boys to name a few, although I have yet to see a COMPLETE soundtrack album released yet! The cast is so great I have got to list them here. Kevin Kline, Glenn Close, Mary Kay Place, William Hurt, Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum, Jobeth Williams(Babe!), and Meg Tilly.
B000063DI9|5.0|I personally think this album is superior to most Maiden albums. Some people complain about the keyboards, but I think they add a great effect to Maiden's music. It makes it sound a lot more \\"mysterious\\", which really fits in well with the overall theme that is present. Heavy metal purists may not be content with this release, but if you're a fan of genres outside metal (specifically progressive), then I highly recommend Seventh Son. Also, make sure to check out some of the other Maiden releases. Iron Maiden is, without a doubt, one of the greatest metal bands ever.
0800177177|3.0|This poor rendition of Dracula is so flawed, disjointed and obtuse that were it not for its MST3K-ability it would make a good target for plinking. <br /> <br />However the movie can be highly enjoyable as a drinking game. <br /> <br />Rules: <br /> <br />Every time Keanu Reeves butchers his English \\"accent\\" take a drink. <br />Ditto Winona Ryder. <br />Each time the plot inexplicably changes take a drink. <br />If you can figure out why Ted is in Transylvania instead of Redfield like it's supposed to be in the book take two drinks. <br />Each time Keanu Reeves stares blankly take a drink. <br />Ditto Winona Ryder. <br />Every time Dracula changes his form take a drink. (there are about 20 of them) <br />Breast shot? Take a drink. <br />Every time you get confused by what's going on take a drink. <br /> <br />Bonus points for: <br />Figuring out the chase sequence at the end of the movie. Say what? <br />Figuring out what the heck Keanu Reeves' last line means. <br /> <br />Be sure to drink beer or you won't get through the first half hour. <br /> <br />See? Movies can be fun.
B0000029AP|5.0|This is the only album by Aerosmith I like that the band worked on. It is their <br />biggest and best album ever! This one had two of Aerosmith's biggest hits, <br />\\"Walk This Way\\" & \\"Sweet Emotion\\". I like both those songs that are radio <br />favorites. I used to like their greatest Hits album, but it was too much single <br />radio/song edit. Once I got this album, I listened to it a few times, and think this was better than the greatest hits album. If you like aerosmith, don't get <br />me wrong, I'm not a big fan to Aerosmith, this is just the best album by the <br />band. I'm more a fan to these bands. <br /> <br />Guns n Roses <br />Dire Straits <br />Lynyrd Skynyrd <br />Manfred Mann's Earth Band <br />& More.
B00006AW2E|5.0|Chronologically, this would be the third LP by the band released in their homeland as opposed to the US where the albums were usually compilations of the UK single, EP and LP releases. Case in point, the UK \\"Out of Our Heads\\" consists of a combination of tracks from the US album of the same name and \\"December's Children\\"(also has the same cover as the latter.) Confused yet? That's how it usually was when lps by British groups were put out stateside. Anyway, this album is very much a no frills (hit singles) example of young band on the cusp of superstardom and evolving their sound by still incorporating blues, soul and R&B standards along with more originals. Examples of the former include Otis Redding (\\"That's How Strong My Love Is\\"), Marvin Gaye (\\"Hitch Hike\\"), Solomon Burke (\\"Cry to Me\\"), Don Covay (\\"Mercy, Mercy\\"), Chuck Berry (\\"Talkin' Bout You\\") and Sam Cooke (\\"Good Times\\"), all credible versions of legendary artists. Originals include \\"I'm Free\\", \\"Under Assistant West Coast Promo Man\\", and \\"Heart of Stone\\" (a US single the previous year). The all-time classics singles \\"Satisfaction\\", \\"Last Time\\" and \\"Get Off of My Cloud\\" were left off the British lp, but if you are a Rolling Stones fan you already own those songs on various compilations. I think it's great that this album became available in the US on CD just for the fact it was an original recording, the songs that were meant to be on a long -player and not a record company hodge-podge. This album proved to be the last of the early era Stones lps, where covers dominated the track listings. Next up would be \\"Aftermath\\", the first great Rolling Stones album. Still \\"Heads\\" is definitely a solid purchase for the Stones enthuisiast but maybe not the casual fan.
0451167716|5.0|I do have to start with the admission that I do feel the movie was, in the case, better than the book.  Anyway, I enjoyed it more.  That could be just me though.  That being said, I do feel this work is well worth the read.  It certainly will grab your attention and hold it.  I would rank it a bit above pulp fiction as the author's style and character developement is quite good and the story line certainly works. Even those who do not particularly enjoy \\"ganster books,\\" (I fit that category), will find something to like about this book.  It is simply well done!  I would certainly approach the book as entertainment rather than a social comment on our society, as I am not sure of the accuracy of the research that went into it.  Anyway, read it and enjoy and I do highly recommend.
B00000D9TK|5.0|Those who think of Las Vegas neon when Celine Dion is mentioned, would be surprised to find that her work in French is more like candlelight...and a moonlit serenity in songs like the brilliant \\"Je crois toi\\" and the final exquisite \\"S'il suffisait d'aimer\\".  This album is a terrific collaboration with Jean-Jacques Goldman, who wrote 10 of the 12 tracks, and the other two, \\"Terre\\" and \\"Papillon\\" (one of my favorites) were composed by arranger Erick Benzi, whose orchestrations are also lovely and complimentary to Celine's voice.<br /><br />The power and range of Celine's voice is extraordinary, but it is not used in a flashy way here, only to enhance and accentuate the music; the musicianship from everyone involved in this recording is exceptional, giving us a thoroughly satisfying CD for all Celine fans, those of us who mostly prefer her in French, and those who might be converted upon listening to this wonderful CD.<br /><br />There are some big, lavish songs like the fabulous, \\"Tous les blues sont ecrits pour toi\\", but most have a delicacy to them, with Celine singing in a pure style with few flourishes.<br /><br />Jean-Jacques Goldman, who has attained much popularity in France since the mid-'80s as a solo artist has a large body of work to his credit, alone and with other artists, and his work with Celine is stellar. The booklet insert has all the lyrics (only in French), the sound sparkles with clarity, and total playing time is 51'46.
068987474X|5.0|Although I admit that at first while I was reading, I was starting to feel a little depressed!  Oh.  So, he just wasn't that into me. Wow.  But the more I read and the more I realized this was actually a release of sorts-the better I felt.  I don't have to waste time any more wondering this or pondering that.  And, I've realized there are certain types that I attract that Hey! Are just not going to be that into me! So therefore, I need to change the parts of me that are attracting that stuff that just is not that good for me!
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest movies of all time. A great cast including Tim Robbins (Mystic River) and Morgan Freeman (Bruce Almighty). This movie shows the growing friendship of two prison inmates at Shawshank Prison. This movie also depicts the terrible prison violence that went on in the 40's and 50's. Overall a great movie with a great ending, so go buy it today!
B0002ZDVF4|4.0|Universal puts together great DVD editions with plenty of special features, but SHAME on them for all the advertising they plug into 'em.  That's the major downside to this DVD which is a sophisticated Euro-thriller for the thinking movie goer.<br /><br />Unlike other reviewers, the direction did not distract me nor detract from my enjoyment of this smart, above average adventure story.  It's not quite as good as the original, but definitely fun and well produced.  Thoughtfully written and beautifully acted by Matt Damon (it must drive Ben Affleck crazy that his best buddy is consistently succeeding in every department of the showbiz store!).<br /><br />The Deleted Scenes explain some major plot points...I don't understand why they weren't included in the final edit....it is not an overlong film (1 hr 49 min).<br /><br />There's a great set up for a third film...let's hope it will deliver the punch of the original and take Jason Bourne back to Europe where his adventures belong!<br /><br />Lots of fun...If you enjoyed the first, you'll at the very least *like* this one a lot.
B000002HK4|4.0|This is one of those CD's, like ELP's Tarkus, where the first half is incredibly good and the second half not good at all. In other words, the title epic and \\"Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding\\" get 5 stars +, while the rest gets one star. Thankfully, the good part comes all at the beginning so I can just stop the CD after the Elton John cover and be perfectly happy.<br /><br />The Zep and Purple covers and the \\"Big Medley\\" remind me of going out to a club and seeing a really, really good cover band.  It makes for a great evening out, but would you want to buy a CD of it and listen to it over and over?  Or just listen to the originals?<br /><br />DT's take on Elton's \\"Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding\\" escapes this critisism due to the truly energetic performance and the fact that I actually like this version more than the original.  Terrific stuff!  This was actually the first DT song I ever heard, when I arrived at a friend's house as this was playing on his CD player.  This CD had just come out.  \\"Who IS this?\\" I asked him.  \\"Dream Theater,\\" he said, \\"But this is nothing, wait till you hear the title track!\\"<br /><br />Which leads me into the good part of this release, \\"A Change of Seasons,\\" the title epic and in my opinion Dream Theater's finest work.  A lot of people don't like Labrie's vocals.  A lot of people say DT does too much aimless shredding.  Too much showing off and not enough actual music.  Well, none of this comes into play on \\"A Change of Seasons,\\" where the band combines their considerable talents with a well thought out epic full of great music, memorable hooks, seamless changes in tempo and time signature and a hair-raising finale.<br /><br />I like this CD and recommend it, with the caveat that if you're like me, you'll listen to most of the cover versions once or twice, like them, but rarely listen to them again.
B00004R7TP|5.0|I can hardly find the words to express how beautiful this album is, and I've only had it for five days. That is how amazing it is. I'm a newcomer to Kate Bush and \\"Hounds Of Love\\" is the first album I've bought by her, but it definitely won't be the last. I remember watching a video in the early hours of the morning once in my bedroom - it was of a programme I had taped from a few years ago: \\"VH1 UK's 100 Greatest Women.\\" Kate Bush came in at No.10, and I remember her from the people who were talking about how amazing she was - Tori Amos being one of them. Now I am a huge fan of Tori Amos, and to see that her entire early career was virtually based on the music of Kate Bush, I was very interested.<br /><br />I don't know what made me buy Hounds Of Love for Christmas, but I'm glad I did! This album is almost 20 years old, and it doesn't seem like it. It's still as vital and fresh as it must have been back in 1985. Kate isn't very well known in the US, but is pretty much an icon in Britain and Europe. The 3rd August 1985 issue of NME included Kate in the \\"Where are they now?\\" file. On the 5th August Kate performed her brand new single on BBC TV's Wogan show. The critics were blown away. Within 18 months the very same NME hailed that song as the best single recorded by any British non-black artist ever. That's how much of an impact the music on this album made.<br /><br />The album itself is split into two sections: the catchy/accessible section and the Ninth Wave section. The album opens with \\"Running Up That Hill,\\" the single which NME were so fond of. The song is, indeed, a classic masterpiece. The trotting beat is very catchy and the dream-like swirls of sound that stamp a trademark on this song are amazing - very visual. \\"Hounds Of Love,\\" the title track, follows. This is an unusual but wonderful pop song. Kate's vocals are brilliant as she sings almost ecstatically - \\"It's coming for me through the treeees!...I take my shoes off, and throoow them in the lake!\\" I love this song, it's amazing. \\"The Big Sky\\" is an even better song, as Kate sings with a child-like innocence. The beat is very bouncy and catchy, but there's more to these songs than just fluffy pop. The \\"Diddly-di, diddly-di!\\" part is amazing as is the clapping after 90 seconds. So many things that are right with this song. \\"Mother Stands For Comfort\\" slows the pace down a bit and is a beautiful ballad. The unusual sounds in the background create a perfect soundscape and the chorus is very melancholy. \\"Cloudbursting\\" is another fantastic song with a beat that will drive a wedge in your brain! The catchiness and majestic prowess of the almost-marching tempo completely makes this the classic it is today.<br /><br />This is the end of the first section, and the Ninth Wave section begins with track 6, \\"And Dream Of Sheep.\\" This is a short but very memorable song, and definitely one of the best on the entire album. It's a very slow and beautiful, dreamy ballad with the piano following Kate's vocals. The song has almost blissful and heart-breaking beauty, especially in the section where she sings, \\"Like poppies, heavy with seed, they take me deeper and deeper.\\" \\"Under Ice\\" begins dramatically and differently to its predecessor. Kate sings as someone else skating on ice as the real Kate is trapped under the ice, screaming to be let out. The violins give the song that chilly effect, especially in the way they are short and sharp. \\"Waking The Witch\\" sees Kate travelling through time and finding herself as a witch ready to be burnt at the stake.  The build up to the main song, however, is amazing: the voices whispering things like \\"Wake up child, pay attention!\\" and \\"Wake up, love!\\" are hypnotic as is the slow piano solo. Then in what can only be described as a burst of jilted and distorted sound at 1:18 is the part where Kate is thrust back into time.<br /><br />\\"Watching You Without Me\\" is probably the least memorable song on the album, but I do still like it a lot. The same can be said for \\"Jig Of Life.\\" Again, I like it, but it doesn't stand out amongst the real classics here. Things pick up with \\"Hello Earth\\" which is not only my favourite song from the whole album, but quite possibly one of my favourite songs ever. I can't describe how beautiful this song is. It's exactly six minutes long and shifts four times from Kate singing slowly to the softer chanting of men. This part of the Ninth Wave finds Kate looking at the earth from Heaven - she can see the earth from a distance, and can tell a storm is brewing! She's telling all the fishermen to get out of the water quickly, and this build up is superb, and of course, her \\"Why did I go?!\\" wail. \\"The Morning Fog\\" sees Kate making her way down the tunnel of light as she emotionally says goodbye to her family.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />This is where the album ends on the original version, but the 1997 re-issue (to mark EMI's 100th anniversary) contains six extra tracks - \\"The Big Sky (MeTeorogical Mix),\\" \\"Running Up That Hill (12\\" Mix),\\" \\"Be Kind To My Mistakes,\\" \\"Under The Ivy,\\" \\"Burning Bridge,\\" and \\"My Lagan Love.\\" I really like all six, making this one of the few albums where I adore nearly every single song. I've only had this album for a few days, but I am in awe of Kate and her talent. The music on this album is dramatic and very visual, like it was made for a stage production - especially the Ninth Wave section. I think I need to buy a few more Kate Bush albums, especially \\"The Sensual World,\\" \\"The Dreaming,\\" and \\"The Kick Inside.\\" In the meantime, I'll have to settle for this, her most critically-acclaimed album.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|This is the best Beatles album ever assembled.  I will go as far as to say it is better than the infamous \\"White Album.\\"   This CD contains all of their biggest hits, re-mastered with superb sound.  Also the CD cover booklet contains many photos of their Album jackets, one page dedicated to each song on the CD.  If you are a Beatles fan, it will excite you to find all of your favorite songs on one compact disc.
0060005688|5.0|This is a fascinating discussion of the implication of research in various fields, summarized for the non-scientific reader.  We live in a society of economic competition which assumes if you give people enough choice, then competition between our various options will result in the \\"best\\" surviving in the market--not just the best products, but the best schools, careers, political parties, etc.  Our society also assumes that the more options we have to select from, the more satisfied we will be.  Schwartz brings all these assumptions into question.  First of all, many of us are on choice overload.  Do we really want to invest all the time and anxiety that many of us spend to come away with the *best* pair of shoes or the *best* lampshade?  Will we really be happier as a result?  Furthermore, the way we really make our selections is not nearly as logical as most of us would like to think.  I came away thinking that life is too short to spend it making up my mind.
B00008PX8P|5.0|WOW!! this truly is the HOLY GRAIL of Led Zeppelin. Got this for christmas and I didn't know what to expect.I was blown away. Visual and audio is stunning,this has all the magic and mystery of Zeppelin at the height of their career, with over 5 hours of unseen everything.The charisma of Zeppelin shines through. Bonzo's thunderous pounding rhythm, Jones' bass, keyboards and mandolin create the balls of the band. While Jimmy Page's guitar work is the cutting edge sound all rock guitarists still today try to emulate. You have to experience Page playing the bow on dazed and confused, it's so eerie it freaks me out even with the lights on. And of course Plant's gut wrenching vocals, where he can sing so delicate and then wail at the top of his lungs,it feels like the music is pushing you over a cliff.All 4 ingredients  combined create the greatest hard rock band of all time. BUY THIS!! the best live concert EVER, it's packed with gems interviews,home movies bootleg tape, too much to mention. Thank you Jimmy Page for this flawless diamond in my home DVD collection.
1592400876|4.0|I, as Lynne Truss, bemoan the generally declining level of proper vocabulary, spelling, grammar and particularly punctuation as typified by today's high school and college graduates.  Writing is becoming a lost art.  Reading resumes and reports is mind-wearying because many people today do not know their \\"mother tongue\\" (English) and, thus, are terribly inept at writing it.  Ms. Truss points this out in a light-hearted, but very pedantic manner.  Even so, she does not cover some of the more arcane punctuation issues.    I remember once receiving a C- on a report I wrote on International Relations between the two world wars.  As I leafed through the pages of my returned report, I found not a single comment or deduction for content.  All the markings were for simple gramatical errors (this was before word processing programs) and I had spent many hours typing and re-typing this report.    After class, I went to see the prof.  I told him, only half-jokingly, that I thought I had signed up for a history course, and not an English course.  His reply has stayed with me for ever since: \\"even the most perfect report is impeached with the first misspelling\\".  I have learned he is absolutely correct.    \\"Eats, Shoots and Leaves\\" should be read by any and everyone who must use the written word to communicate.  The reader should be warned that this book is written for the British English writer, but she does diffenentiate between British and American practices.
068987474X|5.0|This book is amazing.  I bought it, and was on a flight when I took it out of my bag to read.  I ended up removing the cover (so no one would know what I was reading!) and underlining almost every other chapter...it's so TRUE.  If you are frustrated and not sure if you are moving in the right direction, you NEED to read this book!  I found myself in every chapter.  This convinced me to end a lousy, damaging relationship;  I think it will help you save months and months of wasted time in \\"go nowhere\\" relationships.  To quote the author:  \\"Don't waste pretty\\"...he's so right, and I'm so done! I've bought 5 copies for my good friends..you have to read it.
B00006IR5S|5.0|What is wrong with people?  This soundtrack is, without question, one of John Williams' very BEST soundtracks, if not my favorite out of all of them.   <br /> <br />One of MY favorite tracks is the \\"Cornish Pixies\\" one.  The wild strings/woodwinds capture that scene in the movie BEAUTIFULLY and effectively.  Similarly, the \\"Moaning Myrtle\\" voices and accompaniment TRULY capture the movie magic of that character  (Nobody else but John has such a talent for capturing the essence of the movie scene).  My other favorite is \\"Reunion of Friends\\", which builds up through increasing crescendos with the strings to a magnificent ending.  This track is thoughtful, rich in musical gems, and inspiring.  Truly, the orchestrations on this CD are brilliant, astounding, and moving.  How could people trash this soundtrack?  I don't understand it at all. <br /> <br />People always totally TRASH John Williams when he isn't doing a Star Wars, Superman, or Raiders of the Lost Ark kind of movie.  Why in the world should this be so?  In this movie, he is subtle, a bit dark, and without question, wonderful.  Some of his most subtle music is his BEST.  I cannot believe one of the reviewers said, \\"John Williams is on his way out.\\"  I have no idea why anyone would say that.  As a string player for long years (having played in dozens of orchestras and ensembles), I think that over the years, his orchestrations simply get better and better. <br /> <br />I also have to mention that Fawkes the Phoenix is a great theme, but because of the richness of the strings.  The triplets in the background strings are what make this track so RICH in orchestral color. <br /> <br />I'm one of the few people who has NOT heard the CD from the first movie, but I suspect if it is anything similar to this soundtrack, it is wonderful. <br /> <br />To anyone reading reviews, be advised that this is one of John's BEST.  (John Williams DOES have two or three soundtracks out there that are disappointing, but this really is NOT one of them.) If you truly love good full orchestral pieces, you will LOVE this CD, no question about it.
0446608955|5.0|I loved the movie so much, and this book really completed the whole picture. The book is told in a humorous manner at times and a romantic manner at others. It is such a wonderful book that I wouldn't want anyone to miss out on such a wonderful experience.
B00005JN2Z|3.0|What do you get when you cross Phone Booth with Heat?  Collateral, an intelligent action drama.<br /><br />So what can you say about such a movie?  Well, Michael Mann, who directed Heat, OBVIOUSLY directed this movie as well, its clear as day, BUT, thats the good, and the bad.<br /><br />WARNING ENDING GIVEAWAY!<br /><br />You see, anyone who has seen Heat (and Collateral for that matter) has noticed that Mann likes to turn the bad guy into a lovable, respected, and great character, then kills him.  But who kills him?  The loser good guy.  Mann gets kicks out of developing a great bad guy who everyone likes, but also develops a complete loser good guy, whats up with that!  Mann does such a fantastic job with his movies except for this one fact, which is troubling- as this is what stay's in your head at the end of the movie, it bothers me, and it keeps bothering me everytime I think about the movie.<br /><br />But anyways - I gave this movie 3 stars, heck, the movie was absolutely incredible.  Tom Cruise does a phenominal job, completely believable, and so does Jamie Foxx... wow!<br /><br />I won't go into the details of the movie - theres 150 other reviews that do this.  But if that type of ending bothers you (did the ending to Heat bother you?) then you may be disappointed with this one too, just a fair warning.<br /><br />I highly recommend seeing this movie though, as the only disappointment will be the ending.
B000255LNE|4.0|As a long-time fan of Collins' work, had this been just another hits type package, Love Songs would have been a real disappointment. Thankfully, this release offers a very palatable assortment of classic Collins favorites among several non-album cuts, live tracks, and alternate mixes. Hits like \\"Against All Odds\\", \\"Can't Stop Loving You\\", \\"Two Hearts\\", \\"You'll Be In My Heart\\", \\"Do You Remember?\\", and \\"Groovy Kind of Love\\" are blended thoughtfully amongst off-the-beaten-path material, demonstrating that this celebration of Phil Collins' ballads clearly has both casual and devout fans in mind.<br /><br />Among the non-album tracks are \\"Tearing and Breaking\\", which is a John Martyn collaboration Phil Collins recorded during the Testify sessions; a live sound check version of \\"True Colours\\" recorded on the 2004 First Final Farewell Tour in Toulouse, France; \\"I've Been Trying\\", which was previously released on A Tribute to Curtis Mayfield; \\"Somewhere\\", which was previously released on The Songs of West Side Story; a cover of Smokey Robinson's \\"My Girl\\" which was previously available on the now out-of-print Songs From The Board EP from 1994; and Irving Berlin's \\"Always\\" and Jerome Kern's \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" which were recorded on Phil Collins' 1990 ...But Seriously Tour and his 1998 Big Band Tour respectively.  Among the more subtle gems on this collection for the more serious collector are a new stereo mix of \\"One More Night\\" (which sounds true to the original), \\"I've Forgotten Everything\\" from Both Sides and \\"It's In Your Eyes\\" from Dance Into The Light have been sped up a few beats per minute (BPM), \\"This Must Be Love\\" from Face Value fades more quickly than the original album version, and the version of \\"Least You Can Do\\" from Testify is a clearly different mix.  All in all, both passive fans and Collins enthusiasts will find Love Songs to be a solid offering.
B0002234LS|3.0|By about a half hour into \\"Secret Window,\\" I had pretty much figured out what was really happening and where the story was heading.  That's not usually a good sign when it comes to films of this type, but \\"Secret Window\\" still manages to be a fairly efficient psycho/stalker thriller, even with its painfully obvious triple-somersault-with-a-double-back-flip ending.<br /><br />Based on a Stephen King work, the film stars Johnny Depp as a writer named Morton Rainey, a character we may assume is not too far removed in some ways from the author himself.  One day, Rainey is approached by a mysterious stranger from Mississippi (John Turturro) who accuses the writer of having plagiarized one of his stories (published by Rainey under the title \\"Secret Window\\").  Despite Rainey's protests of innocence in the matter, the man, who calls himself \\"Shooter,\\" starts making life miserable for the young author, who is already struggling with a messy divorce from the wife (Maria Bello) he caught cheating on him in a nearby motel.<br /><br />Thrillers like \\"Secret Window\\" always seem to be caught between a rock and a hard place when it comes to working out their storylines.  Modern audiences have developed such an insatiable appetite for ever more elaborate plot twists and surprise turnabout endings that the writers of these films end up having to compromise narrative plausibility to satisfy the demand.  As a result, like most thrillers these days, \\"Secret Window\\" starts off well then goes steadily downhill, as the plot elements begin to spin more and more out of control and credibility flies out the window.<br /><br />For a good part of the time, \\"Secret Window\\" is fun to watch, as Depp tries to figure out what it is that this enigmatic stranger really wants.  Although the red herrings are not always totally effective, they do occasionally divert us off the tried-and-true path along which the story is traveling.  The film is at its best when dealing with the tensions between Rainey, his wife, Amy, and her current lover, Ted, played by Timothy Bottoms.  The actors bring a human dimension to what is, after all, a pretty soulless exercise in audience manipulation.  Turturro has a fun time hamming it up with his cornpone Southern accent, although he still manages to come across as a threatening and menacing figure from time to time.<br /><br />There's a small window hidden behind a piece of furniture that may or may not hold the key to everything, but it is so confusingly handled in the screenplay that the audience is left scratching its head trying to figure out what it all means. Indeed, that is the biggest shortcoming of the movie's final act; besides being silly, implausible and way over-the-top, it doesn't make the connections it needs to in order for us to understand what's really going on.  It's all a game of a thriller, but a game that fails to lay down the rules in a fair enough way so that we in the audience can play along as well.  As a result, we feel very much cheated and had by the time the closing credits come crawling by.  So, if you go into \\"Secret Window\\" with your eyes open and your credibility meter shut off, you may wind up enjoying the film.sions between Rainey, his wife, Amy, and her current lover, Ted, played by Timothy Bottoms.

B00004WGAI|5.0|I watched this series at a young age when it originally aired on the BBC and it prompted me to read the book.  I am forever grateful to the BBC for making such a wonderful adaptation, and for introducing me to one of my favourite books.   I have re-read and re-watched the book and video many times and never fail to enjoy doing so.  Whenever I read the book, I have Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke in my head, as to me they 'are' Rochester and Jane. I've seen many other versions and to me, none of them match this one for showing the true character of Rochester and Jane, the chemistry between them, and the faithful following of story and text.  I've often wished there was a DVD of this Jane Eyre available, as I believe it is the only version worth watching.  So - thank you amazon! - I have found on amazon.com details of a Region 1 DVD, due for release 19/04/05. I hope that nothing happens to change this (as I've already pre-ordered my copy and the disappointment would be acute!) - and I can give my weary VHS tape the rest it needs!  Whichever format you choose - I urge you to buy a copy of this adaptation, for it is most truly the best.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Ok... There are so many opinions regarding this CD. The funny thing is that most people seem to either Love or Hate it! For me, the music was wonderful. It is the kind of music that gives you a relaxed feeling of quietness and simplicity. Simple and true is how I describe it.  I started listening to Nora Jones after hearing \\"Turn me on\\" in the movie \\"Love actually\\". Since then she has become one of my favourites. The song \\"the nearness of you\\" is my particular favourite.  Nora Jones is a brilliant talent with a beautiful voice. however, if you like loud music full of bad language and pounding, this CD is not for you. It is more for those who love the quiet and peaceful voices such as Nora's, along with the quiet and to-the-point soft music that comes with the deal. It really is about enjoying the meaning of every word. It is not for parties or night clubs. It is for you to relax and relax and relax.  Some people simply hate her music because she didn't write the lyrics. I think that the point of music is what it means to those who are listening to it rather than those who wrote or performed it. Do you care who came up with the recipe of your favourite dish as long as your mother can cook it nicely?!  All in all, it really depends on what kind of music you like. If you're not sure, borrow the CD from someone, listen to it, then decide whether you want to buy it or not.

B00027JZ3E|5.0|I first saw this when I was fourteen and it completely blew me away. Great cinematography (Unforgettable opening sequence with the boardwalk and rollercoaster at night), hot actors and funny lines. <br /> <br />I recently watched the DVD version again and was expecting to cringe in embarrassment. Instead, it was still as entertaining as the first time I saw it, despite the dated clothes (but seeing that the 80's are back again, not that bad)and the greasy saxophonist (that was possibly the worse part of the movie). <br /> <br />The acting is still sharp and the vampire lore precisely identified and employed. It's amazing to think that Kiefer Sutherland and Jason Patric were only just 18 when they did this -- they've got incredible screen presence. I'm hoping for better things to come from these two. <br /> <br />Also, this movie only serves to show that teen movies then were pretty damn good. Today, that genre has just become so banal, with jokes veering left of the \\"beeatch\\" category without so much as a ha-ha (case in point, Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen). Also note how thin the acting has become (Hilary Duff??)Can Lizzie Maguire The Movie stand the test of time like Ferris Bueller or The Lost Boys? I think not. <br /> <br />What I also like about this movie is that they didn't compromise on the vampire lore. It's a copout for scriptwriters/writers to bend the rules and have their vamps withstand sunlight and garlic. it's much harder for them to work within the rules and still come up with something fresh which is something this movie has done. I suspect it's partly the reason why it was so successful. <br /> <br />Great, great stuff. This movie deserves a giant rave like this one!

I only own a handful of his work,but this one really stands out for me. The introspection, the maturity and the simplicity in his delivery has a very real power. It amazes me that so many fans don't like this cd or find the songs to be \\"not very good\\"but I respectfully disagree.
B000002GVO|5.0|Though often the favored target of rock's more esoteric critics, and prone to many of the ego clashes and chemical excesses of most rock bands, the Eagles nevertheless had a strong discipline when it came to creating records.  This was true on every studio album they ever made, but particularly so on their monstrous 1976 smash HOTEL CALIFORNIA. <br /> <br />This time around, the band became more hard-rock oriented, thanks to the departure of lead guitarist Bernie Leadon and the addition of Joe Walsh just prior to beginning work on the album.  In many ways, HOTEL CALIFORNIA, like their 1973 classic DESPERADO, is a concept album with various themes consistently running through it, thanks to the combustible nature of Glenn Frey's and Don Henley's songs.  Whereas DESPERADO was centered around the Old West, this album is centered around the dark side of urban life in Los Angeles--what one might call SoCal Gothic.  The almost supernatural feel of the title track and the highly-charged \\"Life In The Fast Lane\\" contrast quite well with Frey's heartbreak classic \\"New Kid In Town\\" and Henley's epic closer \\"The Last Resort.\\"  The most poignant moment of the album is almost certainly Henley's own \\"Wasted Time\\", inspired in large part by a real-life breakup with girlfriend Loree Rodkin. <br /> <br />Propelled further by the dual guitar work of Walsh and Don Felder, and Randy Meisner's exceptional bass playing and vocals, HOTEL CALIFORNIA proved to be the band's biggest studio album in terms of sales (fifteen million and still climbing), but also a very hard act to follow, which sadly caused the band to disintegrate a short three years later, not to return until 1994, when, as we all know, Hell froze over.  Knowing this history, however, does not dampen the impact of either the band or this incredible 1970s chronicle.  It is one of rock's essential albums, without dispute.

The book turned out to be one of the best books I have read in my lifetime. Buy this book or get it at the library if it is available if you want a few hours occupied by a great mystery.
0790733900|5.0|Paul Newman is not an acting legend for nothing.  He has had so many spectacularly great roles and performances to his credit that it's hard to choose just one.  And one of his best has to have been COOL HAND LUKE, that classic 1967 prison drama that was one of the defining films of that turbulent time and helped cement Newman's reputation. <br /> <br />Based on the book of the same name by ex-con Don Pierson, who co-wrote the script with Frank Pierson and who has a cameo role here as a prisoner, the film stars Newman as an out-of-work drunk who is arrested in a small southern town for \\"maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence\\"--in other words, taking the heads off of dozens of parking meters.  This lands him a two-year sentence on a brutal chain gang, whose leader, named Dragline (George Kennedy, in an Oscar-winning performance), takes an almost instant dislike to him until he engages Newman in a boxing match in which Newman's Luke doesn't quit even when he's down. <br /> <br />Newman gains the respect of his fellow prisoners for his \\"don't give a damn\\" attitude; but he soon raises the ire of the prison guards, especially after his escape attempts.  After the first one, the head prison chief known as the Captain, played by Strother Martin, upbraids him with the line etched into Hollywood immortality: \\"What we've got here is...failure to communicate.\\" <br /> <br />Just about the finest prison genre movie there has ever been, COOL HAND LUKE is directed in sterling fasion by Stuart Rosenberg, and features a perfect Americana score by Lalo Schifrin.  Alongside Newman and Kennedy are such future stars and character actors as Dennis Hopper, Ralph Waite, Harry Dean Stanton, Luke Askew, J.D. Cannon, Robert Donner, and Wayne Rogers.  Filmed almost completely on location in Stockton, California, and featuring many memorable scenes, including the famous egg-eating contest in which Newman consumes fifty eggs in 60 minutes, COOL HAND LUKE has lost none of its power in the thirty-seven years since its release, and is vigorously recommended, particularly alongside similar and more recent outings like THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and DEAD MAN WALKING.
B0002OERI0|5.0|A Concept Album from Green Day? YES and what a concept. This album is second ONLY to Pink Floyd the Wall as far as concepts go. Having said that the Music on this Album is far superior to anything I've heard in a longtime. I had lost interest in Green Day as of late and I have everything up through Nimrod or Insomniac which ever was later. American Idiot marks a new growth and maturity in Green Day's songwriting. Jesus of Suburbia so seamlessly integrates different moods, styles and expression. Holiday, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, She's a Rebel are some of the standouts, but every single song is great. I've already listened to this CD several times since I got it last weekend and when I'm not listening to it I've got the songs going through my head. An Excellent addition to anyone's music collection. Listen to it LOUD!.
0767834739|4.0|I REALLY ENJOYED THIS FILM AND I'M A MASTER AT THE GAMES SO IT WAS FUN TO HAVE MORE GAME ELEMENTS IN THE MOVIE. HOWEVER THE DVD BOASTS OVER 6 HOURS OF EXTRAS WHICH IS'NT TRUE. THERE ARE 3 COMMENTARIES AND MAYBE ABOUT AN HOUR OF BEHIND THE SCENES FEATURETTES. FOR ME, A BIG SELL OF A DVD IS WHETHER OR NOT IT HAS A COMMENTARY, THIS ONE HAS 3, BUT I DON'T THINK HAVING 3 FEATURE-LENGTH COMMENTARIES  JUSTIFIES THE ADVERTISEMENT OF MORE THAN 6 HOURS OF BONUSES. I FEEL THAT COMMENTARIES ARE MANDATORY AND THE SPECIAL FEATURES SHOULD BE ALL THE GOOD STUFF WE SEE BEHIND THE SCENES. A GREAT DVD TO HAVE ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A FAN OF THE GAMES, BUT A BIG LET DOWN AS FAR AS THE SPECIAL FEATURES GO. <br />                                                                                            --- JULIEN RAFAEL
B0002X314C|3.0|To be fair, I haven't really listened to the CD in its entirety.  However, I have taken a sample listen to every song but nothing catches my attention.  For me that's a way I know I've paid money for a good CD when I get hooked on the first few notes. Lyrically, there are a few songs with some substance.  Musically, however, the arrangements are typical run-of-the-mill for what's being heard in the mainstream from some other new wanna-be-retro-soul-artists.  The producer(s)/Arranger(s) don't seem be willing to step out of the box - you hear the same old tired hip-hop beats, common time signatures, dull uninventive background vocal arrangements, etc.  And with that as the backdrop for a voice such as John it makes the whole production at most, blase or routine.<br />  There are a few shinning moments from John, and yet, from all the hype I'm left expecting much more.  I haven't heard anything that really blows my mind -- he seems to be singing by rote, somehow disconnected to the emotions and meaning of the lyrics.<br />And PLEASE people how could anybody write in a review that there is a likeness to Donny Hathaway (one of the greatest voices of all times). Sorry, John has to spend a little more time \\"Getting Gifted\\" -- he'll have to learn quite a few things from the Masters before he could deserve such a comparison.  To do otherwise would be an insult to Donny Hathaway.  I agree that Mr. Legend has a somewhat unique voice although quite frequently from time to time there is a striking resemblance to bad-boy records' Carl Thomas.  I'm amazed no one has made that observation in any of the reviews accept maybe one.  Listen, you've only got a few extremely talented artists today who really deserve such comparisons to Stevie Wonder or Donny Hathaway (i.e. Glen Lewis, Donnie) & wouldn't you know it, they aren't getting even half the hype this guy is getting.  Now, if you really want to hear someone who really embraces the soulfulness of a true legend such as Donny Hathaway or Stevie Wonder, check out Frank McComb (The Truth; Love Stories also BuckShot LaFonque-Music Evolution).  This guy's got it all: depth, soul, substance, lyrical meaning & he plays the heck out of the piano.  He's yet another truly gifted artist whose talent is being over-looked & shrouded by the music industry's obsession with the superficial (i.e. sales over quality or marketing over talent).y or Stevie Wonder, check out Frank McComb (The Truth; Love Stories also BuckShot LaFonque-Music Evolution).

B0006399FS|4.0|Perhaps in their best top 3 or 4 albums in my opinion. I've been listening since they first splashed on the scene. I consider Achtung Baby to be their best album. Their conversion in the early 90s' up to 2000 fit the times perfectly. POP was the biggest disappointment but when it was brilliant it was as brilliant as anyhting they'd done before.  <br />Lyrically this is their best album since Achtung but musically it doesn't rank completely up there. Still, there are some really greatly crafted rock songs here. Having said that, my feeling is that this is so far above any of the current pap out there now that passes for rock it's not worth comparison to anything other than previous U2 albums. Or did I just compare it to everything else? No mind. No one is standing as tall as U2 right now. Forget the rest of the sodding reviews you've read. Forget mine. This album has struck a cord with the people. It will be remembered and treasured for a long time to come. And in the end, that's really all that f***ing matters isn't it?

B000002P5W|5.0|What can I say about Hendrix that hasn't already been said. He was one of the most talented musicians that ever lived. He has enriched our lives for the last 5 decades with his genius. And he was taken too soon. Axis is a fine album. Not as immediate as Are U Experienced or as adventurous as Electric Ladyland. But it is the second helping in the golden trinity of Hendrix Studio albums. And contains some superb music. Little Wing, Castles Made Of Sand & One Rainy Wish are beautiful and show a more introspective gentler side of Hendrix persona. If 6 was 9 AND Spanish Castle Magic are bold funky tunes. And the Title track my personal fave from the album is simply amazing, a combination of beauty and power. I highly recommend this album to any Hendrix fan, or any music lover wanting to get into his music.
0385335482|5.0|Rebecca \\"Becky\\" Bloomwood is without a doubt one of the funniest characters ever written.  Sophie Kinsella can do herself proud for coming up with such a personable, witty, zany and relatable character.  This is the first novel in the series. <br /> <br />At first glance one might write Becky off, by thinking \\"This is impossible.  No one person can own this much crap, much less feel the need to buy more of it.\\"  However, as you continue you are swept away in a whirlwind of frenzied antics and are wondering just how this is going to turn out alright for our heroine. <br /> <br />The crazy things Becky gets herself into are too good to be disclosed.  The real treat of these books are the letters to Becky from various parties.  Usually her bank or the credit card company.  Rarely, does a book make me laugh out loud or lose my place from laughing so hard but this one did and it is just the tip of the Becky Bloomwood iceburg.  Should you decide to read this be sure to have \\"Shopaholic Takes Manhattan\\" on hand, you will want to dive in straight away.
B000002U82|3.0|Floyd have always been a mystery to me. And I don't mean their sound. Rather their appeal. They are competent songwriters and musicians. And Dark Side Of The Moon is a good album. But there are many greater in the history of popular music. They aren't in the same league as the Beatles. And their sound called space rock, was done earlier and better by the greatest ever guitarist Jimi Hendrix. Listen to 1983 (A Merman I should Turn To Be) from Hendrix Electric Ladyland album. And tell me in all honesty Pink Floyd weren't influenced by this song immensely. To the point they have virtually based their whole career around its sound and adventurous structure. They are good at what they do, but space rock wasn't invented by them, or done best by them.
B00003CXSP|5.0|Many people remained astonished after the film . Confused perhaps because they had tought this was a sequel but this is a wrong appreciation.<br /><br />In fact Hannibal is free in this case and precisely this fact makes the things turn around .<br /><br />The artistic gaze is a crude and brilliant exercise of superb good taste . Think in Florence the ancient memories of Hannibal in his prison 's pictures , and besides the nest of the Reinassance .<br /><br />Think besides in Dante , Pazzi and consider his death as poetic justice .<br /><br />You may argue the film is gore , but what do you expect from Hannibal?<br /><br />The cast is splendid . Oldman made a glamorous tour de force as an invalid hunger of revenge .<br /><br />The erotic presence of Julianne Moore makes Clarence Sterling a little bit altered respect to Jodie Foster .<br /><br />The first entry is a pshycological thriller. This part is a hard multiple chase from Pazzi and the FBI and simulateously all of them seeking Hannibal , superbly played by Anthony Hopkins possibly the best actor in the world who just was working in Titus Andronicus .<br /><br />The default perhaps resides in some minor aspects such as : How can Dr. Lecter to travel from Europe to USA being one of the ten most dangerous criminals and how could Clarence penetrate in the Oldman ' home with such easiness ?<br /><br />If you let these questions to the random you may enjoy of a very clever and intelligent drama which will face you against our particular dragons .<br /><br />Brilliant artistic direction , superb photography , memorable acting of Giancarlo Gianini (nominated in 1976 for his breathtaking performance in Seven beauties), Ray Liotta and a bit of Francesca Neri .<br /><br />Not recommended for squeamish tastes or sensible viewers.
B000002UAU|4.0|This album took pop music in a new direction and is one of my favorites.\\"A Day In The Life\\", makes the album. And \\"Its Getting Better\\" is almost a perfect pop song. Some songs don't stand up as well as others like \\"For The Benefit Of Mr Kite\\". And overall it isn't as strong as the Beatles greatest album Ever \\"Revovler\\". But its definately worth adding to your collection.
0156027321|4.0|Life of Pi This is a terrific book. Pi is a young Indian who is  moving to Canada with his family. The ship sinks. Pi is thrown into life raft. Pi is stranded on the life raft with a tiger, a hyena, and zebra. Through his ingenuity. The story is one of courage and survival. The author brags that after reading the book one will have to believe in God. The journey that Pi takes is definitely a spiritual one, but it was hardly his faith that saved him. It was the boy's intelligence, resourcefulness, and ingenuity that makes his survival amazing. Martel is an accomplished writer. The book is an easy read and moves well. Pi is developed as a character masterfully. The book is introspective and thought provoking. It is astonishing how much there is to do on a small life raft in the middle of the Pacific Ocean while a tiger lurks on the oposite end.
B000002UAR|5.0|This album is without question the greatest pop album of ALLTIME. And my second favorite ever, only because I am a Hendrix Junkie and rate Electric Ladyland slightly ahead of Revolver. But the music on this album is timeless and pure class. The fab four are at the height of their powers here. \\"Tommorow Never Knows\\" is amazing, and there isn't a weak track on the album. \\"Taxman\\" shows The late great George Harrisons talent and \\"Got to Get you Into My Life\\" is McCartney's greatest ever vocal performance in the Beatles.\\"And My Bird Can Sing\\" is pure magic and my favorite song on the album. This is THEE album to own if you appreciate GREAT POP MUSIC. GET IT!!
B0000CABBW|5.0|Whale Rider is an exquisite movie. Eastern New Zealand lends itself to a sumptuous setting. Gentle winds from a blue sky blow over the waves of an even bluer sea. Pikea is the granddaughter of a Maori chief. She was born under tragic circumstances. She has the potential to be the leader of their community, but she faces tradition and her own grandfather's obstinate disposition. Keisha Castle-Hughes gives a starred performance. She has a lot of potential in the cinema world. This movie has a very touching soundtrack. It has a great girl power theme. Perhaps the thing I liked most is that Pikea instead of rebelling and fighting to make change, she uses tradition and works within the system to effect change. <br />

B00003CXXP|1.0|A.I. marks Steven Spielberg's return to fantastical storytelling, depicting a futuristic society in which androids are created as servants for people. The Sixth Sense's Haley Joel Osment stars as David, the first android child (and the first android programmed to love), who is given to a couple as an experiment after their natural son falls into a coma. <br /> <br />Sadly, A.I. is a boring film interspersed with scenes incomprehensibly weird (originally conceived by the late Stanley Kubrick, his influence is clearly evident) or sequences that are extremely dark and disturbing. Thus, despite promotions as a magical fable, it is not suitable for anyone under the age of 12. <br /> <br />A.I. also suffers from a misguided vision that tries to blend together too many elements. Lacking originality, it borrows heavily from Bicentennial Man, Blade Runner, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, Waterworld and Spielberg's own Close Encounters, all of which developed their storylines and themes in a much more exciting and dramatic manner. <br /> <br />The movie also parallels Pinocchio, as David sets out to find the Blue Fairy so he can become a \\"real\\" boy. (It's surprising that 'When You Wish Upon a Star' was not used as background music -- but, of course, Spielberg already did that in CE3K.) Along the way, Osment is joined by Jude Law as a cocky android gigolo who forms an unlikely attachment to the boy. Together, their journey takes them to a sexual playground called Rouge City, the ruins of New York, and an arena not unlike the Roman Colosseum -- instead of feeding Christians to lions, spectators cheer as outdated android models are executed in a variety of horrific ways. <br /> <br />One would expect to find some interesting personalities in a world so dramatically different from our own, but the film is populated by a collection of annoying and one-dimensional characters. The vapid and shallow culture of the future does include some rather unique accessories and vehicles, but clothing that is distinctly twentieth-century. <br /> <br />Overall, A.I. is far too melodramatic and offers little point or punch in its weak message about our need to love. Spielberg's biggest disappointment since Hook, the film is also spoiled by the 'Once upon a time' fairytale narration, and an abundance of questions that are left unanswered. <br /> <br />The conclusion, set 2000 years after the main events in the film, is far too long in coming...it seems like you have to wait two millenia for a pay off that never delivers. One thinks back to the arena where unneeded androids are blown out of cannons -- so, too, should the entire effort for this tiring and tedious film. Rating: 3 out of 10 <br />
B00005JNNL|5.0|MOVIE: Ramon Sampedro has spent the last 30 years of his life confined to his bed after being paralyzed from the neck down.  This is the true story of Sampedro, played by Javier Bardem, who faught all his life so that he could commit assisted suicide.  The theme of this movie is dignity, and it throws around the idea of how a man who lives in such a state could have any.  Even though Ramon has found no reason to live, he affects everyone around him.  In one part of the film a woman who wants to befriend Ramon asks him why he's always smiling if he says that he's unhappy.  He responds by saying that living the way he does you learn to cry with a smile.  In the end, Alejandro Amenabar doesn't force his audience to pick a side over whether it's morally right for a man to commit suicide due a confined state such as Ramon's.  Yet, the audience will go on an incredible emotional journey watching Ramon and his family going through these times.  Amenabar not only wrote and directed the film, he produced, edited, and composed the score.  May I add that the film's score is one of the most beautiful film score's that I have ever heard.  If you want to hear a snipet of it then watch the trailer as it uses the score.  Overall, the movie is an intense journey through the times of one man's journey to salvage what dignity he has left, and it is a moving journey at that.<br /><br />ACTING: Javier Bardem is one of my favorite actors, and the transformation he makes to become the aging Sampedro is breathtaking.  The audience sees just how big of a transformation it is when the film shows flashbacks of the Ramon's accident where Bardem plays a Sampedro who is 30 years younger.  I loved Javier Bardem in The Dancer Upstairs, and some regular movie goers may recognize him from Cllateral.  Most of his career has been in Spain and he recently has appeared in some American films.  The Sea Inside has my pick for Best Foreign Language Film this year.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: An intense look at dignity in our lives that shows how different people choose to live their lives.  I guarantee that anyone who sees this film will be deeply moved.k at dignity in our lives that shows how different people choose to live their lives.  I guarantee that anyone who sees this film will be deeply moved.

1401301010|5.0|I'd have to agree - it's amazing Anthony isn't dead.  But I got a lot more out of the book than the previous reviewer did (then again, by his own proclamation, the previous reviewer doesn't appreciate the music of the quartet.  The previous reviewer says he only likes the ballads.....)   <br /> <br />Just by staking that claim, the previous reviewer has no idea what Kiedis is about, what his band is about, or what anything was about during that time.  It's like the reviewer went through the 80's and early 90's with blinders on, picked up the book in 2004, and poo-pooed the whole era. <br /> <br />What a freaking moron. <br /> <br />Kiedis' CO-WRITTEN book is a very insightful ride into the drama that enveloped him during his journey to be an artist.  His ups and downs (there are many downs) are detailed so that you literally want to get up and shake the guy,  \\"Wake up!!  What the hell is wrong with you?!??!!\\"  I can only imagine what he put his friends & family through. <br /> <br />Kiedis doesn't detail sexual \\"conquests.\\"  Rather he details loves of his life  \\"....she could be my girlfriend.\\"  His love life is very touching, yet maddening....always going for the wrong gal out of passion. <br /> <br />His drug use was hopeless & adventuresome - just when I thought he'd be clean....  here again, I wanted to slap him. <br /> <br />In short, I feel the book was about a boy overcoming drug abuse, & it's an excellent read. <br /> <br />I'm left wondering if the previous reviewer & I read the same book?

B0002X314C|4.0|I beg to differ with some of the other posts. I love this album!!! This album deserves 4 1/2 stars. His voice is soulful and classic. With the help/production of Kanye West and other producers, John formed a polished and defined sound that sets him apart from other artists. His voice is powerful and at times one forgets the music in the background. His lyrics are heartfelt  which makes \\"Get Lifted\\"  an album that you can talk about 10 years from now.    However, I personally enjoy the live albums better than the studio album just because his voice is not affected or altered by the 'background' which some artists today rely on to cover up their faults. If you are not in awe about \\"Get Lifted\\", please check out his live albums. They completely showcase his awesome vocal range along with extraordinary piano skills. His live performances allows the listener to feel his passion in singing and piano, which one can miss on this album if they are not familiar with his live work/performances. Please go to site and order the other albums. If you doubted his credibility as an artist, you will change your mind once you hear these albums. If you can, I recommend you all to check him out live. He wil be in DC peforming 1/15/05 at Kili's Kafe.    Also please check out Eric Roberson (Vault 1.5 and The Esoteric Movement), he is another artist that is hot and has been in the game for a while producing and writing tracks for Musiq Soulchild, Dwele, Carl Thomas, Vivian Green, 112 and Jill Scott.

B00007LTIC|5.0|As noted, Atlantic remastered much of Yes' classic catalog a few years back. Now, Rhino is having a go at it. The Rhino versions differ than the Atlantic versions, in that they feature bonus tracks. Most of the bonus tracks to these Rhino re-issues are disposable, but on this particular re-issue, you get a few bonus tracks that were found on the _Yesyears_ boxed set, which means that fans who don't want to shell out the extra cash for these tracks, can now get them for less.<br /><br />Yes released this magnificent, often overlooked gem in 1977: a time when art rock was being scoffed at as pretentious and overblown. Punk had surged forth, and Johnny Rotten & Co. had a field day ripping Yes, Pink Floyd, Queen and others. It would appear during that time (at least during the making of this album), the members of Yes didn't give a darn about the trends of the day, as their usual cosmic, soaring, mystical aesthetic pervades the album in a big way (which is a good thing.)<br /><br />The music on here is splendid - soaring, lush, illuminating -- an orgasm for the soul. Jon Anderson's vocals soar high, Steve Howe's guitar playing stuns as usual, and is very fluid, Chris Squire's (and Steve's) backing, majestic vocals blend magnificently with Jon's (and not to mention the man's bass playing), Rick Wakeman (who makes his return with Yes for the first time since 1973's _Tales From Topographic Oceans_) supplies his virtuosic, classically-oriented flourishes not just through synthesizers, but also a church organ, and other types of keyboards.<br /><br />Alan White is possibly one of the most underacknowledged drummers out there. His drumming skills possibly go largely unnoticed due to the overpowering cosmic front brought on by the other members of the band. With this powerfully compelling, lush exterior Yes possesses, how could one possibly be fully aware of subtle nuances that are arguably beneath the surface? While many of us are being lifted higher to some heavenly place, it is all too common to miss the technical brilliance that is going on. Alan's drumming is the perfect example for this. While all of the cosmic stuff is knocking us sideways, Alan is in the background doing all sorts of creative and impressive things on the kit: his sense of time, the creative use (and placement) of the cymbals and snare hits during a certain meter, and other subtle things should not be taken lightly. This is just one of the many, many, many reasons why I think Yes are special: they possess technical brilliance, but they have something else as well -- something that's arguably even more powerful and intangible than their technical abilities.<br /><br />The title track, while cosmic and grand, is quite raucous, mostly due to the steel guitar musings from Steve Howe. It can be grating at times, but it also helps to give the track a harder edge. The rhythmical quality of the vocals during the bridge (repeated once more before the ending) is quite creative and seductive. This, and more, help to lead up to the orgasmic, goosebump-inducing climax of the song, which feature choral effects from the vocal harmonies.<br /><br />\\"Turn of The Century\\" is a smooth, mystical, ballad with a new age aesthetic. The lyrics on here are touching, and the soundscapes are ethereal and image-inducing as ever. Jon's vocals are outstanding as always. Sonic textures mostly brought on by Steve's musings during the middle of the track give way to the ethereal, majestic climax near the end of the song.<br /><br />\\"Parallels\\" is written by Chris Squire, and is grand and soaring as ever. Rick's use of the church organ here certainly adds more of a mystical, spiritual and regal quality to the track. This track, while cosmic on the outside, is quite busy underneath it all. Check out the time changes, the multiple vocal layers, and the instrumentation that is going on all at once -- Rick's keyboard lines, Steve's guitar lines, Chris' basslines, and Alan's drumming.<br /><br />\\"Wonderous Stories\\" is much like \\"Turn of The Century\\" -- a ballad with a mystical, new age aesthetic. Jon's vocals, as always, are precious and moving. Steve's guitar lines here are quite melodic, and what's impressive are how well they blend in with the rest of the instrumentation.<br /><br />\\"Awaken\\" is classic. Like the rest of the album -- but more specifically, here -- it is almost impossible to put into account the effect it has on me. It's the 15-minute closer of the album, and boy, is it ever so good. Grand, lush, soaring, illuminating -- this track soars, and it shines as bright as the sun. The massive bed of sound just smothers your senses, and does not let go. Yes even got a church choir to add their voices in certain parts of the track. It is the most goosebump-inducing song on the album, and is also my favorite Yes song. There is quite a bit of stuff going on here -- the vocal harmonies are penetrating, the basslines tasteful, Steve's solos orgasmic. On a different listening session, when you're not being seduced by the powerful cosmic aura of this music -- or when you're trying your hardest not to be -- pay attention to the technical stuff going on in these songs. In this track, one of the many things I'd like to talk about is Alan's drumming: pay special attention to what Alan is doing on the drum kit, especially during the \\"suns high streams thru,\\" \\"strong dreams reign here,\\" and \\"star, song, age, less\\" sections of the track. It's quite nifty.<br /><br />This is an excellent album from Yes. Highly recommended -- that is, if you are a Yes fan, own (and love) all of their studio albums, particularly from the 1971-1974 period, but do not own this.

1400032717|5.0|It's hard to say what makes this book so special.  First off--it's not about the mystery.  The book is more about seeing how the main character, Christopher, views the world.  It is funny, sad, and interesting in ways that you wouldn't expect.  Even though there are tangents on every page, it's hard to put down.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|This album is so great!  I don't know how people can say Rush sounds tired.  The album has lots of great tracks, three whole discs full!  Also, the fans are NOT annoying.  It is exciting to listen to thousands and thousands of people get so into the music!  The roar of the crowd adds to the experience of this album.  I saw Rush on the Vapor Trails tour, and they were just as good then.  Rush is still an incredible band, and this is a great album.

B00004Y6O9|5.0|February 1978, was the debut of Van Halen which became an absolute phenomenon and made them superstars in a short time. With songs like Runnin' With the Devil, Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love, Jamie's Cryin', I'm the One, You Really Got Me, Ice Cream Man, and lets not forget Eruption. The one minute and 42 second guitar solo that revolutionize the guitar and made a major impact on guitar players for years to come. It still gives me goosebumps about what Guitar World said about Eruption: \\"with its pinch harmonics, hammer-ons, two handed tapping, whammy bars dives so deep that they'll give you the bends- all in one terrifying package. As the guitar world scratched its collective head and tried to figure out what the hell just happened, Edward Van Halen has altered the very perception of what rock guitar was in one minute and 42 seconds flat.\\" All in all, Van Halen's debut album is absolutely phenomenonal and one of my favorite albums.

B000063JZQ|4.0|A few years after the film was released in the US, I convinced my high school English teacher to take our class to see it. (In the days before video, this involved renting a theater and print.) I was glad I did.  It is certainly the most real and immediate film of the play. The sets, costumes (or lack thereof), and casting all work to create an accurate depiction of \\"nasty, brutal, and short\\" 11th century life.  And of course, there is the wonderful insight of Shakespeare's language to engage our modern sensibilities. <br />One can only thank Polanski for casting such relatively young actors as his leads. Kings lived and died young then, and had to be both excellent generals as well as administrators to succeed. Jon Finch is both athletic and impassioned enough to carry off the soldiering, and young and introspective enough to be moved by his wife both as a woman and co-conspirator.  Of course, Francesca Annis made a splash by doing the mad scene in the nude--but in medieval times, everyone slept in the nude!! so the film is certainly accurate to the time. (And if queen's did, why not covens?) <br />And has been noted elsewhere, at least the castle keeps are cold, dark, and dirty.  The communal sleeping arrangements, straw bedding, flaring smoky torches, seeping walls, and muddy yards all contribute to the historical accuracy of this production.  And keeping with Shakespeare's light vs. dark metaphors, the misty rain and lowering skies combine to enhance the mood. <br />What happens in this \\"Macbeth\\" is as realistic as possible. So what happens offstage in the play, happens onstage in the film: the murders of Duncan, Banquo, Macduff's family.  Murder is nasty and bloody and Polanski (having much experience of its results) makes sure we know it.  Medieval Scotland was nasty and bloody as well, and if the film is accurate in depicting its setting, why not the action?  And only Polanski has an ending that hints that violence and ambition did not die with Macbeth's overthrow.  All said, Polanski's film still has the most accurate medieval setting, engaging performances, and thrilling/shocking battles. <br />PS. For those interested in the real historical Macbeth, read Dorothy Dunnett's excellent biographical novel \\"King Hereafter\\". Dunnett is world renowned for her historical accuracy, and did much research to create not only a plausible rendition, but a thoroughly interesting and entertaining story as well.
B00004BZ16|5.0|I was born in the same year that this masterpiece was released.  I was raised in a house with this album before my very first birthday.  I've memorized every sound on this massive thing, right down to the bizzare, unmelodic Mensforth Hill.  There's is nothing greater in rock history than Sandinista!  If you like a type of music it's sure to be on here:  reggae, rockabilly, power-pop, jazz, rap, a waltz, blues, mo-town, funk, calypso, surf, disco(!?), gospel, whatever Mensforth Hill is, whatever Lose This Skin is, and certainly more that I've left off.<br /><br />Sandinista! is a snapshot from every region of the world.  Photos of what was happening everywhere circa 1980 have been eternally captured by the incredible songwriting of \\"the only band that matters\\".<br /><br />Can the legend be true that all this took place in three weeks time?
B0000024SI|5.0|Listening to \\"Desolation Row\\" will make you understand just how amazingly great this album is. That 11 minute song, along with 8 other tracks, make up one of the best albums ever. An outstanding mix of rock and roll and folk, like only Dylan can do, Highway 61 has only good songs. The title track, my personal favorite, shows just how funny Dylan can be. His satirical lyrics are the best around. And with every song on this album, he proves once again he is the best songwriter, possibly of all time.
0783229526|5.0|I dont consider myself a fan of Terry Gilliam, but I found this movie amazing, creative, funny and bizarre. With this film I have learned that the critics sucks! I have seen many \\"high quality\\" films and I found this film very satisfactory. It is a different Road Movie and now it have become one of my all time favorites and my # 1 film in Cult genre.
B000059QY3|5.0|If you're going to have one Traviata, this probably should be the one. That said, the Stratas/Domingo/MacNeil/Levine is right up there with it. Georghiu is stunning and just at the moment, my favorite Violetta. The \\"almost\\" was that she wasn't always spot on -- but so what? This is a live performance and I long for live as opposed to studio; it's the closet I'm going to get to the Real Thing.<br /><br />The staging is on the spare side, but preferrable to what else is out there as tastelessly fussy. The costume designer outside him-/herself and Violetta is dressed with elegant simplicity -- even her nightgown is more a night shirt and points up how sick she is. And unlike McLaughlin's dying note given at full volume, Georghiu's is (more) believable.)<br /><br />(As an aside, remember when Zefferelli twitted Callas about that note because she mostly cracked on it? She said: \\"I'm DYING, for God's sake.)<br /><br />Buy this DVD.
B00005JNEI|1.0|This thing was a total joke.It completely lacks objectivity.It's full of sound bytes which are removed from the context of whatever conversation was going on.A documentary as I understand it,DOCUMENTS facts and events within context to allow the watcher a complete understanding.[...]
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|Troy should be the sort of movie that I love -- a lavish, sword-and-sandal epic. A real man's movie! Sadly, although there is a great deal to like about it, it's so solemn, pretentious, and impersonal that it fails to emotionally involve the audience with its characters. That said, if you love exciting, epic battle scenes, or summer blockbuster films, or even just seeing an unfairly handsome and buffed Brad Pitt, all sweaty and virtually nude, then read on . . .  <br />Film is a visual medium, and the original story is very, very long, so I can accept that many changes needed to be made. But in a bizarre move, all of the mythology of the original legend has been removed, and the story is rather presented as a historical epic, and not a mythological tale. I feel this was a great loss. I understand Director Wolfgang Petersen saw the gods as \\"silly and unnecessary to the plot\\". But when you consider the popularity of shows like Xena, I think audiences would be more accepting of mythology than Petersen gives them credit for.  <br />However, for me, the biggest problem with Troy is David Benioff's overly simplified screenplay: He manages to reduce a ten-year war to what appears to feel like just a week or so, he reduces Paris and Helen's romance to dopey teenage \\"I love yous\\", and a lot of the dialogue is empty rhetoric, with Achilles barking empty catch-phrases such as \\"Immortality! Take it! It's yours!\\". Indeed, the film is so solemn, pretentious, and impersonal that it fails to emotionally involve the audience with the characters. I recall seeing this film at the cinema and not really caring if any of the characters were killed. It's a pity that some of that $US200 million spent on the film couldn't have been spent on a script-doctor.  <br />The quality of Petersen's direction also varies. On one hand, he brings epic and complex action scenes with awesome set pieces to life with great precision. On the other hand, almost everything in Troy looks and feels fake. Many of the amazing sets and costumes, look like . . . well . . . amazing sets and costumes. Rather than looking like soldiers dragged into a brutal, soul-crushing, ten-year campaign, the men often look like they've just shown up that morning, and had some dirt or dust rubbed onto them. Their weapons don't look used, and the buildings don't look lived in.  <br />For me, apart from the stunning visuals and the beautifully fluid camera work, the most outstanding thing in Troy is Achilles' fight scenes. Over many months, Brad Pitt was trained by swordsman Steven Ho, and he swings his sword with a poetically elegant and deadly style.  <br />There is a lot to marvel at in Troy: The eye-popping visuals, seamless CGI-rendered grandeur, and the epic battle scenes, but if the same attention to detail had been applied to the rest of the film, as it has to Pitt's swordplay, Troy might have been a truly classic epic film.
B00000JLWW|1.0|The story is kinda OK... I love Kate Winslet and Leonardo is OK, too. I love the storyline and the whole flashback idea. You get so caught up with the story while you're watching that you kind of forget the whole opening sequence, and then... BANG.... you're back in the present. And the effects are terrific... it's sort of funny that they built a 9/10th scale model of the titanic.... what's the matter... the extra tenth would have bankrupted them??? But, hey...  Yeah, I liked it. What I can't believe is that the resolution is so poor. They certainly weren't thinking HDTV or 50-inch monitors when they made the transfer. If you haven't bought it already, I'd wait for the next release.... I'm sure there'll be one.
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|Mystic River opens in a dreary lower middle-class suburb of Boston in the 1970s, where 3 young friends, Jimmy, Sean and Dave are killing time just being boys, playing street hockey and getting up to minor mischief. One of them, Dave, is then kidnapped in front of his friends, by a pair of child molesters masquerading as plainclothes police. We then learn that he escaped from their clutches after four days of sexual abuse at their hands, but was obviously deeply scarred mentally. The film then flashes forward to the same area, but in the present day.  <br /> <br />The three guys, though they have drifted apart, are still living in the same neighbourhood. The daughter of one of the three, Jimmy Markum, played by Sean Penn (I am Sam, Thin Red Line, Dead Man Walking), has been murdered recently. One of the other three, Sean, played by Kevin Bacon (Footloose, Flatliners, Hollow Man) is the investigating police officer. The remaining member of the trio, Dave, played by Tim Robbins (Shawshank Redemption, Arlington Rd) is the prime suspect in the case. <br /> <br />Mystic River is a good, old-fashioned murder mystery in which the tension and plot thickens effectively over the duration of the film. There are plenty of plot twists and red herrings to keep the viewer guessing till the last few minutes. The film is ably directed by the great Clint Eastwood, at the helm of his 24th film. In this film, like in just about all his films, he doesn't try anything flashy or groundbreaking at the helm but is sensitive and competent and builds and maintains a good pace and tension. Despite his long career in action based films, Eastwood seems particularly at ease directing (and acting) in films with a strong focus on characters rather than simply action. <br /> <br />This is primarily a dialogue driven story, with powerful acting from the three leads, supported ably by some great actors including Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney. Indeed, the performances of Penn and Robbins garnered them the Oscars for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively. This was the first time since Ben-Hur in 1959 in which the two awards have been won in the same film.  <br />
B0000251VZ|3.0|I don't understand the hype with this album and I am a huge Iron Maiden fan. For me it is one of the weaker albums with Dickinson. However, there are still great songs on the album that I enjoy listening to including Aces High, 2 minutes to Midnight, Powerslave and the Rime of the Ancient Mariner. Losfer Words is a pretty good tune, but not as good as their previous instrumentals. Apart from that, the other songs I find are weak. If you are a big maiden fan then I understand why you would get this album, but if not you should check out the self-titled debut or piece of mind, which are both better in my opinion.
0440180295|4.0|\\"Slaughterhouse-Five or The children's crusade\\" is the first book written by Vonnegut that I have read, and the experience has been quite good. After reading it, I realized that I had felt all kind of things at different times (or pages) of this book. I feel surprised by the lack of logic in some parts, enchanted by the wisdom of some phrases, and somewhat puzzled by some of the antics of the characters. But I didn't feel bored, not even once, and that is good news in my book...<br /><br />The story is told from the point of view of the writer, at least at the beginning. Shortly afterwards, the main narrator changes: now it is Billy Pilgrim, who like the writer is a former soldier in World War II. The writer and Billy survived the bombardment of Dresden, the city were both were held as prisioners of war (yes, Vonnegut was a POW in the 2nd WW). They stayed in a place called \\"Slaughterhouse 5\\", due to the mere fact that that placed used to be...a slaughterhouse.<br /><br />Billy has some peculiarities that  no one else seems to share: he can become \\"unstuck\\" in time, going seamlessly from the present to the past or the future, and from there to the present again. He is also quite familiar with aliens, having spent a season with them in their planet (as a specimen in the Tralfamadorian zoo), and isn't shy to tell so. Of course, that brings him a few problems with his family, who wants him to upheld his image of respectable optometrist, but that cannot be helped.<br /><br />This work has an anti-war tone that pervades the whole book. That is evident in the musings of the characters on the absurdity of war, and on how illogical many actions were (a good example would be the bombardment of Dresden, a city that lacked war industries). Billy, one of the protagonists of the book, accepts things as they come, and after every death he simply says \\"So it goes\\". He probably is the best illustration of the fact that \\"There are almost no characters in this story, and almost no dramatic confrontations, because most of the people in it are so sick, and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces. One of the main effects of war, after all, is that people are discouraged from being characters...\\" Also, and even though Vonnegut writes that \\"there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre\\", I think that thanks to this book he gives at least a good statement on the massacre of war.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" is a book beyond strange, so if you prefer linear stories, you are highly likely to dislike this one. If there is something that stands out in it, is its lack of chronological continuity. Despite that, I recommend it even to them, because who knows, they may like it. After all, this book has been considered a classic for many years now, so it certainly has some value. On the other hand, if you are one of those who prefer the unexpected in a book, you just must read it, because I'm certain you will love \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\".<br /><br />Belen Alcatbecause most of the people in it are so sick, and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces.

I do consider it an essential purchase for those that have all their studio albums. \\"Hotel California\\" live is as awesome as the original.  <br /> <br />This is one that should be revamped big time into either a \\"Deluxe\\" or box set of their live shows through 73-80 because so much is missing. I feel that (based on setlists) Doolin Daltin, Turn To Stone, Peaceful Easy Feeling, James Dean, Witchy Woman, Lyin Eyes, Already Gone, Tequila Sunrise, Midnight Flyer, Ol'55, One Of These Nights, Outlaw Man, Rocky Mountain Way, Victim of Love, Sad Cafe, and In The City should've been a part of it as well as others I haven't mentioned.  <br /> <br />If they could ever get the rights to have a DVD of the TV and concert footage from this era, it would make a great box set to complement \\"Selected Works\\".  <br /> <br />Even though \\"Hell Freezes Over\\" has better sound quality, this shows them in their real element, live and on stage in front of a roaring crowd.
0684135051|4.0|Some books pretend every one is right-handed or if not should be so they promulgate `right-handed' or `English/American' style knitting instructions on their pages that can lead to plenty of heartache for a minority of the population.  KNITTING WITHOUT TEARS acknowledges that there is more than one way to knit and that the `German' or left-handed approach is okay if that's what you prefer. However, I am not sophisticated enough to learn two approaches at the same time so I have to stick to KNITTING FOR DUMMIES and its right-hand only approach.<br /><br />The author of this book, Elizabeth Zimmerman, says she is a `left-handed knitter' who learned her skills at an early age in spite of the effort of others to make her knit right-handed.<br /><br />KWT is only one of the several books about knitting Zimmerman wrote before her death in 1999.  In the 1960s, she formed a newsletter for those who knitted away from the mainstream as well as those who knew a good thing when they saw it.  She hosted also a nationally syndicated PBS television show called `The Busy Knitters' with a devoted following of millions of fans (including my left-handed mom).  She founded a newsletter and business (Schoolhouse Press) run today by her daughter, which sells knitting-related items and she wrote several books on the subject of knitting. KWT includes plenty of information about creating knitted products as well as reference material.  Why do wool sweaters shrink when you wash them?  Elizabeth will tell you.

I am not unfeeling, callous, or anything else of that nature like another reviewer said.  I never said that I like seeing people get hurt and die!!)  Also, there was a great cast, emotional scenes, and amazing special effects.
044024157X|5.0|If you pick up The Last Juror looking for a legal thriller, you will find something that you did not expect.  The book is a first-person account of small-town Mississippi in the early 1970's and is about as real as it gets.  Grisham has captured my home state as no one else can, showing both the beauty and the ugliness that is our history.    <br />As a native of North Mississippi, I was eager to read The Last Juror, set in the fictional town of Clanton.  Many of the references are real--the newspapers in Memphis, Jackson, and Tupelo, the honky-tonks on the state line, \\"dry\\" Tishomingo County.  The characters feel real too, especially Miss Callie.  The book reminded me of many people from my Clanton-ish hometown.  I enjoyed the way Grisham brought back Harry Rex and Lucius, pre-A Time To Kill.  Harry Rex's directions to his cabin are a hoot!
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|I love Ray Charles. And while I generally believe Ray could make a commercial jungle sound great (he has!), I listened to this album feeling like there were a couple of poor musical choices that did not have to be made. Specifically, his duet with James Taylor and another with Elton John. I acknowledge these artist's contribution to music and individually I enjoy their music. However, Ray seemed to be struggling to make the songs interesting and fresh. I felt the results were mediocre at best. On the spectacular side, the CD is worth the price for the other collaborations, especially BB King, and Bonnie Raitt. Thank you for your genius Ray.
0375759174|3.0|This early Austen novel about a society girl's coming of age reads easily with its considerable dialogue, despite the presence of extensive historical vocabulary.  Definitely of greater interest to girls than boys NORTHANGER ABBEY introduces readers to 17-year old Catherine Morland, a nave but morally-honest well-bred young lady.  Invited to the fashionable watering hole of Bath by the Allens--kind neighbors serving as hosts and chaperones, Catherine is delighted at this  opportunity to seek Adventure away from her calm country home. <br /> <br />     Volume I presents Bath in high season where Catherine is formally introduced to and socializes with two families: the Thorpes and the Tilneys, who reveal stark social contrasts among the upper class.  Mr. John Thorpe, a friend of her brother's, quickly attaches himself to Catherine, but his vanity, arrogance and deceit soon displease and eventually disgust her.  His sister, Isabella, however, proves a dear and immediate friend, <br />at least during most of Catherine's sojourn in Bath.  Soon after she meets the distinguished Tilney family: a stern General, a son who is a Captain, a sweet and modest sister, Eleanor, and the cadet son, Henry.  Vol. I concludes with Catherine receiving permission from her parents and the Allens to spend several weeks at the Tilney homestead, a former Abbey. <br /> <br />     Eager to explore a real edifice which might have been the setting for a Gothic novel, Catherine is thrilled at this extended invitation.  By this time she is very fond of Henry and hopes privately that romance will bloom in the quiet, dignified setting.  Unfortunately she expects the worst horrors as a result of her dedicated reading of Mrs. Radcliffe's novels, for <br />where no mystery exits, Catherine is determined to discover one.  Volume Two describes her gracious reception at Northanger, but she soon feels certain to have stumbled upon a secret family shame or even horror.  Her imagination may be running away with her, but the General's odd behavior seems to confirm her growing suspicious of dark deeds surrounding the death of the late Mrs. Tileny.   <br /> <br />   Suddenly, without any explanation, the domineering General orders Catherine thrown out of his home-defying all the rules of hospitality and decency.  Henry is not present to protest, so Catherine is dispatched alone--in ignominy and secret tears--back to her unsuspecting family 70 miles away.  This tale chronicles the most turbulent year in Catherine's young life, but how much is to be blamed on her excessive devotion to Gothic novels?  Or is there a truly sinister plot undermining the hopes of the young lovers?  JA uses her characters as mouthpieces to express her decided opinions on the role of fiction, literature and history.  This is Austen-lite, with hints of her future work, where her heroines prove better judges of their acquaintances ans their own hearts.   <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Here's a review from a 41 year old man.  I've read lots of reviews of this movie that absolutely trash it. And obviously, it's become quite a \\"cult\\" hit amongst a younger crowd.  In fact, it was my 17 year old son who insisted my wife and I see it.  And we immediately loved it, from the delightful opening credits to Napolean's first line \\"Whatever I want to!  Gosh!!\\" <br /> <br />The critics who have trashed it frequently say that it makes fun of its characters...that it condescends to them. I'm surprised at that attitude.  In so many movies, oh, let's cite \\"Revenge of the Nerds\\" as an architypical example, the \\"nerds\\" are losers who aren't really.  They're just different from the jocks or the \\"beautiful people,\\" but by the end, they've changed, become winners and made fools of the bad guys. Everyone learns a lesson.   <br /> <br />The fact is, these movies are untruthful, however \\"uplifting\\" they may be.  We all know that in life, there ARE \\"losers.\\"  People with not a whole lot to offer the world in general.  Napolean and his family and friends ARE losers. And Napolean KNOWS it. He doesn't seem to dream of being accepted. His ambitions (to draw, to be a martial artist / bow staff wielder, etc.) are things he is deluded about, but he seems to know it.   <br /> <br />The movie isn't about how Napolean rises from the lower depths to become some sort of hero. Essentially, we see him pull himself up by his own moonboot-straps, primarily to take a few steps into to a world where he connects with people.  He's not about taking on society or arguing that he's \\"different but just as worthy\\", as the NERDS movies would. <br /> <br />When his brother Kip takes him to a Tae Kwon Do class, Napolean is inspired by the ridiculous owner's words, \\"Everyone needs a buddy, no more flying solo.\\"  He goes out and makes friends with the friendless Pedro, and says to him, \\"We're pretty much buddies now, right?  So you've got my back and stuff, right?\\"  Napolean just wants someone to havehis back and vice-versa. <br /> <br />Later in the movie, Napolean shows his character when he gets Pedro's back by providing entertainment during the school elections.  I won't say more, except to say that Napolean's bravery and reluctance are palpable in the hilarious and touching scene. <br /> <br />And what about his \\"enemies?\\"  There is one jock who beats up on Napolean for no good reason, and this guy never really gets a comeuppance.  This guy doesn't get any support from others at school,either, and we certainly know that this \\"jock\\" is a loser too.   <br /> <br />Part of this comes from the fact that the movie is set in a small town in an \\"obscure\\" state (Idaho), that appears to offer few prospects to anyone.  No one dreams of going to Hollywood or becoming a star or a computer whiz, doctor, etc. etc.  There aren't any dreams. (Although, to Napolean and Pedro's credit, they seem to have quite a knack at agriculture...which may be what lays in their future; Deb is a natural entrepreneur.) <br /> <br />Napolean, basically, is a loser comfortable in his own skin, and beneath his sullenness, is...a sullen teenager.  He's a pain in the neck sometimes, but through his modest strength of character, he makes a close friend, and takes tentative (and VERY sweetly convincing) steps towards a first romance.  But only tentative...the final shot of him playing tether ball with his female friend tells us all we need to know about how ready he may or may not be for love. <br /> <br />Also, this is a rare movie that shows people who don't have a lot of money.  The lack of money is dealt with constantly (they can't afford martial arts lessons, an extra car, a new suit, etc.) This is very refreshing, because in most movies dealing with teens, most of the kids (winners and losers alike) aren't exactly hurting for money. <br /> <br />The movie is packed with indelible characters (each more self-deluded than the next) and gentle affirmations of how there is someone for everyone...even Napolean's more hapless brother Kip. It's also very funny (Napolean teaching himself to dance, the farmer shooting his cow, the llama, Uncle Rico's almost pathological desire to travel back in time, etc.) <br /> <br />I don't know why this movie connects to today's teens. I'm not a teen, afterall.  But I sure see teens I know in Napolean.  His bursts of \\"Idiot!\\" ring quite true.  But I appreciate the quiet, unexpected heart of the movie, and I believe the filmmakers aren't poking fun at these characters...they are just staying true to who they are.  I also appreciate that the film is PG rated and doesn't need to show teens all obsessed with sex, drugs, inappropriate music, etc.  They probably are, but the filmmakers aren't interested in examining the usual...they're shedding a little light in humerous corners we don't usually look. <br /> <br />This is a funny and touching film. Should appeal to any teen or parent of a teen anywhere.
B00005JNEI|4.0|The name of this film might suggest a study of 9/11 and the events and people surrounding it, but make no mistake about it, the one person that Moore is going after is George W. Bush.  And everything in this film was contructed to instigate Dubya's donwfall. <br /> <br />Well, let me clarify the word \\"constructed\\".  Most people tend to fall on either side of the fence when it comes to this movie, the conservatives would say it's all liberal propaganda, and the liberals would hail Moore as the champion of undisputed truth.  To be fair, they are both right, and they are both wrong.  If you'd just keep a clear head as you watch this movie, and do a little research yourself, you'll find that Moore does manipulate history to mislead people's thinking, but there are also areas that's been well researched and supported.  Examples: While Moore pointed out that the Bin Ladens in America were the only ones allowed to fly immediately after 9/11, they were in fact put on flights one week after normal air travels had resumed in the country; on the other hand, the Bush family's strong business ties with the Bin Ladens and the Saudis are very well documented by other sources and dates back to Bush senior.  So when I use the word \\"contructed\\", I don't mean Moore had gone ahead to invent fictional facts for the purpose of his political agenda, but rather, he has found a way to creatively and artistically put together the truthes and the half-truthes in a presentation against Bush. <br /> <br />Is it a good documentary, hmm, debatable.  It's very opionated and by no means fair-handed.  Moore does build a strong case against Bush, criticising his character flaws and delivers seemingly a mountain of evidence on his questionable relationship with the Saudis.  He stops just short of implicating Bush in the attach itself, although I doubt he would mind if his audience was being led down that path.  Is this a good movie?  Sure.  I found it to be both insightful and entertaining at the sametime.  Moore is a skilled filmmaker, and knows how to find humorous and yet revealing angles to tackle an issue. <br /> <br />Love him or hate him, Moore and \\"Fahrenheit 911\\" probably has helped to inspire a new level of civic enthusiasm that's unseen in this country for many years, manifesting itself in the high level of voter turnout at this last election, ironically, the result was probably much to his chagrin.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|My memories of the Live Aid concerts are very fragmented because I was only five years old at the time, but I have been waiting for years to finally get this on video. While not being complete, this DVD set contains some excellent concert footage from many acts at the peak of their success, and the humanitarian purpose behind the concert makes it all the more moving.<br /><br />The set contains some priceless performance footage. My personal favorites are Queen, who perform six songs (the most of any artist in this set), David Bowie, Madonna (only six months after she burst onto the music scene), The Who and Dire Straits. All of the above bands perform their signature songs, with the exception of The Who, whose generator blew up and prevented \\"Pinball Wizard\\" and \\"My Generation\\" from being broadcast. The DVD set is also littered with some excellent footage from some of the most popular bands in the 80's. Other notables include U2, Duran Duran, Nik Kershaw, Ultravox, Hall & Oates, The Cars, The Pretenders, Elton John (in his \\"fez hat\\" phase) and Mick Jagger's priceless duet with Tina Turner are all included. The list goes on and on, but needless to say that any music fan will find something to like in this package. Overall, you get 10 hours of great music for a great price.<br /><br />The problems with this DVD set are trivial when you look at all that is included, and the worthy cause. Sure, many bands and songs were excluded, but the book that accompanies the DVDs explains that much of the footage was lost or unusable. The occasional hiccup with the sound and video is to be expected, since this was recorded almost 20 years ago. The Wembly concert is definitely better quality, as it was professionally recorded. The American concert in Philadelphia is variable as it was not. The sound quality is generally good, but crowd noise and static sometimes impedes the music, and the introductions from the MCs at the show (Jack Nicholson, Bette Midler, and Chevy Chase) are often inaudible. But I really wasn't bothered, as 99% of what is included here is brilliant.<br /><br />There are also some DVD extras, which are usually minimal on music DVDs. The videos for the excellent Band Aid song \\"Do the know it's Christmas?\\", the abysmal \\"We are the world\\" video, the original BBC report on famine in Ethiopia, and segments from the CBC documentary (shown live at the concert) which was the catalyst for organizing the concert. All of which bring awareness to the strife in Africa, and it is difficult to watch at times.<br /><br />Ignore the overly-critical people who complain from the rooftops about what was left out, and be grateful that it was released at all, and now that every penny raised is going to a good cause. This is a great DVD set by any standard, and at the modest price, it is an essential part of any collection.e often inaudible.

0140067477|3.0|Seems like a contradiction right? So are some parts of Hoff's book.  I must note that other reviewers have pointed this out.  Hoff explains, quite clearly (thankfully) that one of the tenets of Taoism is to accept things precisely as they are...and then, as another reviewer says, he doesn't accept the other Pooh characters for what they are, instead disparaging them for not having the simplicity of Pooh.<br /><br />Ultimately, as one who is uninitiated into Taoist philosophy, I would suggest this book if for no other reason than to acquaint oneself with its basic philosophies, which Hoff does explain clearly.  One warning is that, sometimes his forays into conversation w/Pooh, and his story anecdotes are less than clear, and he assumes the reader immediately understood.  Sometimes I felt going off into the world of Pooh was unneeded at a certain point, though at other points it was valid and well-constructed.  Additionally, I would read this book as though walking onto a floor w/a \\"Careful\\" sign on it...this book is unnecessarily judgmental of others, and I feel that by feeling that way about others, one avoids the nothingness and simplicity Hoff says the Taoist seeks.  Judging others adds confusion to life, the very same confusion Hoff wants us to avoid by being as simple as Pooh.  So I say: read this book, and use it as a spur to further readings in Taoism if it interests you, but don't take it as a textbook of Taoist thought.  Many of Hoff's explanations are good, and the quotes from actual Taoists and other Chinese thinkers are excellent, but do not take the judgmental road implied by this book.<br /><br />I think it's worth noting that on the back of the book, where the genre is usually listed in small print near the ISBN, The Tao of Pooh is listed as a humor book.  So read this book w/that in mind.  It is a good intro to Taoism, but ultimately, it is not a book of Taoist philosophy, and is more like a book of metaphysics that utilizes Taoism.  It is worth mentioning that several Taoist ideas (about the harmony of the heavens and earth) are not strictly Taoist, which to me says, not that the Taoists were not unique, but that they have hit on some sort of truth.  Hoff's book can help the average person in their daily life, through the basics of Tao.  Hoff's book will not make one a true follower of Taoism, in my opinion.  However, for most, the former is enough, and the latter is unimportant, and that is fine.  This book operates both as a good pique of the imagination leading to further studies into Taoism, or as simply a book which reminds us of the beauty in the simplicity of life...all in the unassuming world of Winnie-the Pooh.  So for that, the book has merit, even if its unnecessary judgmental nature is obnoxious.<br /><br />3.75 starsral Taoist ideas (about the harmony of the heavens and earth) are not strictly Taoist, which to me says, not that the Taoists were not unique, but that they have hit on some sort of truth.

B000008L90|4.0|I have also heard that this is one of Donna's personal favorites of her recordings.  As well it should be - and the negative attention this album received is really a shame.  Anyone who balks at the song selection or criticizes the style of music shouldn't be reviewing music - for what is here is extremely representative of the style of dance & pop at the time.  The album should have been much better received than it was. <br /> <br />Supernatural Love was hyped up before it was even released! <br />There Goes My Baby was a video on VH1 that STILL shows up from time to time. <br />Donna won a Grammy for \\"Forgive Me\\" -  <br /> <br />come on?!  A bad album?  No way! <br /> <br />Personal favorites: <br />   \\"It's Not The Way\\" <br />   \\"Cats Without Claws\\" <br />   \\"I'm Free\\" <br />   \\"Forgive Me\\" <br /> <br />Donna's voice had really started to slip into the mature Donna - which was a zillion times better than the young Donna - absolutely stunning voice, she has.  This album gave a chance for her to really open it up on a few songs and take that puppy out on the road. <br /> <br />Her vocals in 'Forgive Me' are great - and for years when I heard this song I teared up because Donna's voice is awesome in it. <br /> <br />I recommend this album to anyone who wants to hear many different aspects of Donna's voice.  I think you'd like it. <br />

B000001DV2|3.0|**Edited:  It's not as bad as I remember it, 7 years later.  There are some really good songs on here: Let's Get Rocked, Heaven Is, Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad, Stand Up (Kick Love Into Motion), and I Wanna Touch You are some of the best rock ballads ever written.  So, they should've named this CD \\"Let's Get Balladed\\" instead.  Go figure.  Nothing really rocks on this album -- not much anyway -- but it's actually a good solid ballad album for the boys from Sheffield England.    I'm glad to say I'm repurchasing it from Amazon tonight. The Deluxe Edition - Oh yeah!      ***Previous review below, for posterity's sake.  I must have been *really* cranky that day, 7 years ago.***  I bought this album because I owned all 4 of the previous ones and thought how bad could it be? Pretty bad obviously. This is one of the 3 albums I have bought over the years that I actually threw away.     Out of 5 stars I would rank the first 5 albums thusly:  On Through the Night: 4  High 'N' Dry: 5  Pyromania: 5  Hysteria: 3  Adrenalize: -1    Starting off with the stupid first track on this album (Let's Get Rocked), did kindergarteners produce this album? What in the crap were they thinking?! I don't even remember what Heaven Is sounded like, so I checked it out on this site...yep, crappier than I remembered. [...] This song is cheesier than cheese and has no nutritional value to boot. I gave up at this point trying to remember the rest.    In summary: this album is sappier than most of the 80's pop-rock and it was released in 1992!! All of it had been done 10 years before, and not nearly so [...]    Get one of the first 3 albums and do yourself a favor and listen to some real rock, not this cheezy swill that came later.
B0006399FS|1.0|Nevermind the hype. Just listening to the album itself, it's clear is their most lame effort they've ever made. Horrible !!!. I have no words to explain how bad I feel after listening to this \\"bomb\\".  It's funny to see how desperate are some fans now, trying to do their best in 5 star reviews, but the truth is simple: Most of U2 fans ( specially older fans like me ) really dislike or even hate this safe commercial product. Shameful.  Songs like A Man And A Woman or Sometimes You Can't shows how bad is Bono's voice now. Far from \\"emotional\\" his voice is rough and weak instead. Moreover, the songs themselves are pointless and awfuly commercial. This album is their new Rattle & Hum, that's clear.  I never really liked ATYCLB, so that makes this album even more dissapointing.    Anyone who knows just a little bit about music, composition, etc, can see how better are Zooropa, Pop, Achtung Baby or Joshua Tree than this one, really. Also I don't know how can some fans say \\"this album Rock\\", with only 3 Rock songs in it.    Listen to POP instead, the last REAL U2 album
B0000E6I1J|5.0|A beautiful and heartfelt tribute to a beautiful and truely talented man who was deeply loved by so many. The back-up musicians are at least as amazing as the stars. The love that poured out of Eric Clapton's guitar during \\"Isn't It A Pity\\" brought tears to my eyes. The only down-side to the CD is that it is missing the Monty Pythin tribute and \\"Horse To Water.\\" <br />If you think this is a just another tribute album, think again. This is a magical celebration of the life and music of an true genuis by the people who loved him most and knew him best. If you love George, you will love this CD.
0553582461|5.0|A fantastic, all though a little sad, ending to a great series.  I can only hope she writes another story with the Fool and Fitz.  I skipped her Liveship series but after reading the Tawny Man series and I regret it.  I got the distinct fealing I missed something.  So to anyone looking for a good fantasy series, definetly read these.
B00005J79H|5.0|This is a fabulous live acoustic album which will be really enjoyed by anyone that likes Neil Young and UFO (ie broad taste). It will not be enjoyed by people that only like UFO and Nirvana.
B0000DBJDM|4.0|I tried to watch the Directors Cut with an open mind, setting my expectations low.  The graphics didn't bother me the way that they appear to have bothered a lot of reviewers.  I actually thought that they were kind of cool.  However, the shots of Gilmour and Wright singing in the studio during Echoes Part 1 completely ruined the flow of the movie for me, especially when they were shown making mistakes.  These shots would have made great special features or perhaps they would have fit in nicely between songs.  However, I thought that Maben's decision to insert them during the song was inappropriate and I am unable to understand what prompted that decision.  Fortunately, as many reviewers have pointed out, the Original Concert is still included as a feature.  Another bonus is that the shots of Wright recording the piano for Us And Them and Gilmour recording guitar for Brain Damage are given their own tracks in the Directors Cut.  Regardless of whether these were actual recording sessions or staged for the movie, they are very cool and I am glad that I can choose to go directly to them instead of having to rewind or fast forward to them.  This allows me to treat the Original Concert as the main feature and the Us And Them and Brain Damage tracks from the Directors Cut as special features.  If it were packaged this way, I wouldn't have any hesitation giving it five stars.  Because it is packaged with the Directors Cut as the main feature and the Original Concert as a special feature, I am deducting one star.  If you like Pink Floyd, this is definitely still worth buying.  In addition to the Original Concert and the Us And Them and Brain Damage tracks from the Directors Cut, I think the Maben interview makes this a worthwhile investment for Pink Floyd fans.  I found it very informative.  However, reviewers that warn fans of The Wall are correct.  If you are not familiar with the music that Pink Floyd did before Dark Side Of The Moon you are in for a bit of a surprise.  Hopefully it will be a pleasant one.  :)Hopefully it will be a pleasant one.  :)
B0006399FS|5.0|Excellent album from rock's greatest.  It doesn't matter what they do from here on out, some people will love it, and some people will jump at the chance to berate them.  This is a very well crafted album and an enjoyable listen.  The one-star reviews are completely ridiculous - it's pretty obvious.  \\"Original of the Species\\" and \\"Yahweh\\" are superb.
0743454529|5.0|I enjoy all of Jodi Picoult's books, but this one is outstanding.  One of the best books I've read.  The set up in intriquing in its own right, but in the hands of a lesser author it would have been melodrama.  Picoult, with her eye toward telling details of human nature and familial interaction, makes this a complex story about people we feel for.  As for the ending, which many readers here seem to dislike, I thought it was perfect.  Rather than being a copout as some have suggested, it's a perfect ironic twist, well forshadowed in the first sentences of the book.  It puts the whole drama and struggle depicted in the book in a perfect light.  I have bought this book for others because I thought it was so good.
B0001US62I|5.0|I saw this movie on pirate when it came out in 87, which would have made me 9 years old... <br />I had and open mind and a stong stomach, even then.  <br />If you like Faustus style plot, Noir in colour, Sweaty linin suits, Voodoo rituals, New'leans (It's all one word), and Lisa Bonet, then you'll love this. Parker Captures the spirit of N. O. beautifully, with tap dancing, Tram, club and horse racing shots. Then theres Mickey Rourke, the greatist actor that never was. Still stands up to anything 'suposedly scary' in this age.
B00020HEL6|5.0|Rene Olstead combines the musical attributes of a Norah Jones, Jane Monheit, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald and others in a sophisticated package which belies her young age. Her sense of time, phrasing, intonation , control and vocal embellishments make the 12 or so standards in this recording come to life with new found interest and excitement. The arrangements by the likes of Sammy Nestico and bassist John Clayton perfectly compliment her style, delivery and vocal nuances. Her security of time and pitch is beyond reproach. Her range is extensive but not overly contrived. She gives the impression that she really is having a ball with these evergreen standards. A bright shinning star in the making at the tender age of 14 !!!
B00005JN0T|1.0|A big screen video game. No characterization. Effects that are  obviously computer generated. Such effects are inversely proportional to tension and anticipation. What a waste.
B000001E18|4.0|No, Zooropa is not on the same level as War, Joshua Tree, or Achtung Baby, but it doesn't fall flat on its face either.  Underneath the layers of electronica and dance beats, it's clearly identifiable as U2 with smart lyrics exposing the dark side of modern life.  Yes, often the songs seem a bit unfocused and could have been tightened up.  And putting in Johnny Cash at the end?  Well, after all, it is U2, and they do things like that because they can!  So give it a listen, then another, and decide for yourself.
B00005QAPK|4.0|Spirits of the Dead is a glossy trilogy of Edgar Allan Poe horror tales, each one directed by a different European auteur.<br /><br />Toby Damnit is Federico Fellini's offering, and it is gloriously typical of his surreal style and visual panache. It's also a lot more cohesive than the majority of his features, which the casual viewer will appreciate. The segment stars a damned - literally - flashy actor (Terence Stamp) who's relentlessly pursued by a demonic little girl. (Look for a direct rip-off of said ball-bouncing, blonde-haired tot in 2002's FearDotCom.)<br /><br />William Wilson is Louis Malle's story; it stars Alain Delon as a man driven mad by his own doppelganger (but having a barely-dressed Bridget Bardot hanging out, er, around could also have had something to do with W.W. losing his wits).<br /><br />My favorite of the three, Metzgengerstein, is directed by Roger Vadim. Metzgengerstein is the artsy-haunty story of a debauched countess (Jane Fonda) with a pet cheetah, a push-up bra and a seemingly endless supply of eyeliner. In her failure to corrupt her gentle, horse-lovin' cousin (Peter Fonda), Countess Metzgengerstein burns his stable down. He's killed in the blaze but the morning after the fire, a mysterious black stallion shows up in the royal courtyard. She is strangely drawn to the haunted horse, loving him as she's never loved anything or anyone before. Most critics review Metzgengerstein as the weakest link in this Poe chain, but I love it for its unapologetic homage to Caligula-style decadence, the imagery of the surreal steed, and the bizarre onscreen love triangle between  brother and sister, and sister's then-husband (director, Vadim).<br /><br />Staci Layne Wilson
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I love this CD....I can't get enough. I hope her next one comes out soon!
068987474X|5.0|Most candid, reality based book I've ever read about relationships.  For too long women have justified or rationalized the bad behavior of men in their lives at the expense of their own self worth.  This book uncovers the ugly truth about virtually every situation encountered on the road to finding the guy who IS into you.  I'd personally like to thank Greg Behrendt for having the courage to write this book and for his unwaivering belief that women ARE worth it. This book was very enlightening.
B00005ATQ9|5.0|This is possibly one of the best, if not THE best, movies I have ever seen. The cinematography, the music, the acting, and the directing were the top of the line. I can't even begin to imagine how Kubrick directed some of the scenes in this movie. They seem so real and intense, I forgot on several occasions that this was simply fiction. <br /> <br />The lighting, which is some technology I don't quite understand, is all natural. I loved this. Every scene glows with warmth and beauty, and the characters look even more fine in their finery.  <br /> <br />And I seem to be one of the only reviewers that finds no fault with Ryan O'Neal as Barry Lyndon! The first few scenes I was not impressed so much, but the movie is very lengthy and there was plenty of time for O'Neal to prove himself apt and perfect for the part. I think some people are mistaking the trueness of a sometimes bland character for a bland actor.  <br />One of the things I loved best about this movie was the fact that the protagonist, if you can call him that, isn't someone you can always sympathise with. Barry is the central character, and you begin to feel like you understand him, but you definently don't always like him.  <br /> <br />And I won't even start on the music, except to say that while in the beginning I found the contrast between beautiful soft music and violent scenes somewhat jarring, it evolved into an art. The music was playing in my head for days after I watched this. Exquisite.  <br /> <br />This movie didn't win all of its awards for nothing!
0385659806|5.0|I read all kinds of books and some of them are enjoyable for a while, but I can take them or leave them. This is one of those rare books that I REALLY couldn't put down. I was reading in the morning, with a timer set so I could stop in time to be ready for work. When the timer went off I had to reset it because I could not put it down. I cannot remember the last time this happened- I could just not let it go. I felt like I had entered Christopher's head. Reading this book also gave me some insight into autistic students who attend the school where I work. I have not seen through the eyes of a person whose behavior is outside the norm like this since I read the Noonday Demon. I have recommended this book to everyone I have talked to since I finished it on Wednesday and I highly recommend this unusual and gripping story to you as well.
B0002X314C|5.0|I've been a John Legend fan for a very long time now and it's awesome to see him finally make his big debut. John Legend fans will recognize quite a few of the songs on the album from previous live recordings, and they will also eat up the brand new material. I hope John gets a lot of spins in 2005 and I wouldn't be surprised if he garners the attention he deserves for his fresh-yet-familiar style of soul r&amp;b. John Legend is a breath of fresh air in a mostly stagnant urban music scene today. Get this album; you won't regret it!
B00018D44U|4.0|honestly, i'm not into jazz. my type of music is hiphop. i have never been interested in jazz since i found it boring but there's something about norah's music that makes me like her and her album.    she exudes a sweet and innocent yet mysterious aura about her that draws my attention. i like this album and i'm not ashamed of it!
B00000JLWW|1.0|\\"TITANIC\\" is a titanic masterpiece.  Maybe it's because the boat sinks, a story device which, I for one, didn't see coming.  James Cameron (writer-director) decided to sink the boat!<br /><br />I also liked the love story.  I thought it was totally convincing that a girl would meet a guy on a two day cruise and love him forever.<br /><br />The end was also very satisfying dramatic tension.  I really was afraid Kate Winslet's character would die in the sinking of the boat despite the fact that an older version of herself is narrating the movie.
B00029LNHS|3.0|i didn't like where is the love but some of the tracks can really get you dancing and will probably stick in your mind for some time.  i like hey mama, let's get it started and the apl song. they're not very lyrically talented in some of the songs but they have good beats and they can combine lots of musical styles. if you liked where is the love, then buy this album. but if you didn't like it much, then maybe you can buy a used one, you might still like some of the other tracks.
B000286SCO|4.0|A wonderful DVD to provide a history of shows of this incredible group of musicians. This is real good value, with tons of live footage that has been squeezed in, including a number of songs from a fans only acoustic show. Strangely enough it was one of the extras; their accompanying commentary that I found so insightful. My only gripe about the DVD is that I'd preferred to have been able to watch an entire concert rather than footage interspersed with music videos, documentary inserts...so I look forward to their Live in Budokan.
B0001AP12G|5.0|college dropout is one of the best albums i've bought in my whole life! kanye definitely proves he's different from most rappers today through his debut album. he puts soul into his music and he tackles about life and everyday problems -without the sex, money, women and violence. he also shows his sense of humor in some of the tracks. my favorites are we don't care,allfallsdown,through the wire, jesus walks, never let me down, school spirit,family business and last call. though i admit kanye doesn't possess great lyrical prowess, he makes up for it by giving his heart into his songs. now that's something special.
B00005JMAH|3.0|I saw the movie in the theater and lliked it very much, but I have to say, upon closer inspection on DVD, I am not as impressed. \\"Prisoner\\" is the turning point of Ms. Rowling's series.  This book is when the world she created becomes darker and she begins to explore more serious themes. The problem is that it is impossible to cover the immense span of this book in a two-hour film (and this book is shorter than the next 2).  Cuaron does a lovely job on the visual aspects of the film, but, at times, the visual seems to take precedent over the storytelling-that is where the film falls short. We see a nice choir scene, beautiful shots of the changing seasons, the demise of hapless birds at the limbs of the womping willow-all of them visually stunning but they come at the expense of important exposition (such as explanation of the names Mooney, Wormtail...etc). Overall, I do like the film.  There are some good performances (like Rickman, the 2 Emmas, Oldman, and Radcliffe to name a few), but I saw it with someone who hadn't read the books and found myself explaining much of the movie to her.  <br />In short- worth seeing, noble effort on the part of the director, but it falls just a bit short.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Talk about your black humor, this movie hits all the right chords!! I am not going to summarize the movie, since another reviewer did a pretty accurate job, but I will recommend this movie for fans of Peter Jackson's 'Dead Alive' Sam Raimi's 'Evil Dead II, Army of Darkness'.  It has a campy feel to it, although it was never cheesy and has some clever scenes. There are scenes that'll make you jump out of your seat, and other scenes that will make you laugh.  The acting is great, I love the attitudes these characters have facing their pending doom. This is the best movie I've scene all year!!
B00005JMYI|4.0|I've read a lot of the reviews for this movie, many good, many terrible, but rarely anything in between.  First off, if you didn't like Old School, don't even bother with this movie, you'll hate it, think its stupid, like many I've heard from.  But if you couldn't stop laughing at Will Ferrell when he acts like a cat, or at his \\"Get off the shed\\" skit in his SNL audition, you'll go nuts over this movie.  I've seen this movie at least a half dozen times, and it never gets old...I still plan on buying it.  Now that Jim Carrey is doing more serious movies, Ferrell has moved in as the King of Comedy in my books. <br />This movie is full of comedy great cameos (Luke Wilson, Jack Black, Ben Stiller, the list goes on...) and hilarious one liners. <br />Memorable quote: \\"Mr. Burgundy, you have a massive erection!\\" \\"Oh...no...it's just these pants...I was going to return them......uh......\\"
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This album kept popping up on everyone's best of '04 lists <br /> so I thought I'd check it out. You owe it to yourself to purchase it too. Beautiful, quirky, lush strings, chunky guitars <br /> it's all here and what is so great about it is how it surprises you.  Many of the songs take unexpected turns just when you think they are wrapping up and become another incarnation.  This is one of those albums that you hear and the hair on the back of your neck stands up.  Can't wait to see them <br /> live! <br /> <br />
B0000AI44Q|4.0|I'll give five stars for Neil Young on this disc.  He scorches the guitar, and the band is tight and punchy.  Brilliant playing by world-class musicians, with a huge legacy no less.  What's not to like?  Well...the material.  One star.  A concept album about life in a fictional small town in America?  Yawnnn.  On top of that, a totally unispired (IMHO) treatment of this inherently mundane topic.  There's absolutely no new ground broken, no revelatory insights in the \\"story\\" of these fictional stereotypes, these cartoonish, cardboard-cutout characters, so are we unable to care for them in any way.  They seem totally, comletely unreal.  Neil's voice reveals the truth:  no emotion, because he doesn't care about the so-called \\"characters\\" either.  It must be brutally daunting for Young to have to constantly face expectations that his new records will be as good as his former triumphs, or he'll be slammed by critics -- who never even write one song.  I sure couldn't do it, and he's bound to hit some dry spells.  This is one of them.  The good news is that the musicianship is still intact, and given his history of bouncing back, I've got the greatest of expectations for his particualr genius to shine through on future records, many times more.  I plan to keep playing lots of Neil Young in my house.  But Greendale?  Well...I'll just say that I played it once and put it aside, then a week later tried it again, then a week later a third time, but since then I just keep dust from getting too high on the CD case while it sits on the shelf.  Overall four stars because after all, this is Neil Young.  Let's show some respect.  But please, Neil, no more epics or operas or concepts or whatever you call this.
B0002X314C|3.0|After all the hype of a cd that I paid $7.99 for, I was expecting it to be the new coming of r&b/soul music.  John Legend has a good voice, often times his voice reminds me of Carl Thomas.  It's also refreshing to see a new male artist who plays piano.  But the song selection could have been much better.  Half way through the cd, I was not impressed at all but the songs did manage to get better toward the last half of the cd.  Guess they kept Vanessa Williams in mind and decided to save the best for last!  Since I thought I may have been too hard in my listening, I gave it a second listen. <br /> <br />The standout tracks include \\"So High\\", \\"I Can Change\\" which features Snoop Dog. \\"Refuge (When It's Cold Outside)\\", \\"Live It Up\\" and \\"It Don't Have To Change\\" which features John Legend's family.  \\"So High\\" is probably the prettiest song on the cd.  The lyrics are heartfelt and delivered with feeling. <br /> <br />Other tracks like \\"Let's Get Lifted\\" and \\"Used To Love U\\" are decent also.  But \\"Number One\\" featuring Kanye West could have been left off the cd completely. The song \\"Ordinary People\\" at first listen was rather ordinary.  But after a second and third listen, you hear the passion in the lyrics. It's not a bad cd but for all the hype and buzz that was generated for this cd, I was expecting alot more. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00007LTIA|1.0|This is a terrible record. Consisting of four 20 minute long songs this has to be one of the most boring records ever recorded. I was once told that the long passages of monotonous mellotron are supposed to remind you of being on an ocean. I can see that, because, like the ocean, these songs go on forever, seldom change, and there is no end in sight to them on the horizon. The only person I could recommend this cd for is someone who suffers from insomnia. Everyone else should stay away from this overpriced sleeping pill.
B00005JM02|5.0|This movie was one of Disney's best! Funny, cute, great for kids and for adults. In fact all of my in-laws still take turns yelling \\"Mine! Mine! Mine!\\" at family gatherings (although that is getting old). This one is definitely a keeper.
B00009Z574|2.0|The only reason this cd gets 1 star more than \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\" is because the songs end faster than on \\"Tales\\" and thus the listener is spared from the agony of having to sit through these atrotious numbers. Songs titles like \\"Circus of Heaven\\" and \\"Arriving UFO\\" hint at how bad the contents of this disc really are. The only redeaming music on this cd are the two songs \\"Madrigal\\" and \\"Onward\\". Normally these songs would be considered mediocre, but due to the lack of quality on the rest of this album, [...]. As for the rest of the record, they are the reason cd players come with skip buttons.
B00005JL3A|1.0|I absolutely hated this movie. Resident Evil was the first Playstation game I ever played and I loved it. The game had enough of a plot and storyline that they could have made a MUCH better movie out of it.. if they had even bothered to set the movie in an abandoned Umbrella mansion in the woods, it would have been better. This movie is NOTHING like the game OR the books. I especially hated the cheesy outfit the lead character was wearing.. she was supposed to be a STARS team member, and they don't wear miniskirts for mission gear! HELLO!  <br /> <br />The whole thing was just stupid. I hope that the director of this one doesn't try to tackle any of my other favorite Playstation games for movies.. if he tries to come out with Parasite Eve I'll be violently ill.
B00000IMTF|5.0|The stunning revelation that is \\"Rainbow Rising\\" can never be understated. I am speechless. This record in a word, RULES. By far one of the best classic rock/metal records in the history of popular music. Not one note of filler, not one second wasted. Godly.
0767834739|2.0|This movie would have been better if they had developed the characters more and stopped trying to cram so much into a relatively short movie. <br /> <br />I do not play the Resident Evil game, but I like movies based on games.  It feels like this movie was created by a committee of game players with ADD. <br /> <br />Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory are hot.  The costumes, weapons, action sequences, etc...are very well done.  Overall, it's a good movie that could have been so much better.
068987474X|5.0|I read this book after I had a few dates with whom I thought was a great guy. This info needs to be taught to grade school girls so they can remember it all their lives. This book was right on the money concerning this grown mans(just kidding) behavior. Now that I read this book, I am armed for the next time. Thanks for the insight!!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Based on the life of the director and his brother, Napolean Dynamite is a story about an unpopular kid and his daily life.<br /><br />Sounds exciting, eh?<br /><br />Where the plot is lacking, the dialog/music/clothing are what make this movie so great. This movie brought back so many memories of awkward pre-adolecence days. The charectures were so diverse that everyone who watches this movie will identify with at least one of them.<br /><br />This movie is also very unique in that it has mild cussing and no sex, which is practically unheard of these days in media.<br /><br />Bottom line... I loved, made me laugh to tears and it's the only movie that I have watched 3 times in a row, because it's that good.
0140177396|5.0|This book was a good book because of the lessons it teaches. Of mice and men teaches a valuable lesson about friendships. Although Lennie is struck by a illness that makes him dumbfounded, George still takes care of Lennie. George is a awesome friend that cares deeply about Lennie even though he might show his emotions with him. It comes the time for George to make a important decision when Lennie messes up again. This is a great book that should be read by everyone. You will surely enjoy it and learn a very important lesson. This book will leave you \\"heart struck\\".
B0006A9FMI|1.0|Unless you understand Japanese well enough to enjoy this movie do not waste your money.  The subtitles assault you with over the top OBVIOUS detail, it's like they mixed up the normal subtitles with the closed captioned \\"hearing impaired\\" ones.  Every background sound/noise is presented to you in text, [dog barking], [helicopter approaching], [sound of gunfire], and it's not something you can disable in the setup menu or your dvd player.  How someone could have overlooked this obvious flaw I don't know, however I will be returning my copy and awaiting a release that is done right.  While I am a fan of subtitles, you also don't have an English dub option to choose from as well if that's your thing.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|Both actors certainly outdo themselves in portraiting ... I wonder how that word is spelled anyway .... two completely disparate charcters that have depth and sympathy to the audience .....  <br /> <br /> <br />Tom Cruise as the contract killer manages to get the viewer to feel some level of empathy because of the way in which he treats Max (Jaime Fxx) the taxi driver who is hijacked into driving him around the city while he carefully, and very violently, kills all the witnesses in a drug/gang trial..  <br /> <br /> <br />The story is interesting enough to keep your interest and the charaters a multi dimentional ... Great movie .. I loved it ...  <br />
B00003CXCT|1.0|After reading some of these reviews I won't be purchasing this DVD collection. Fine...enhance an all ready great movie, but add it as a second version on the DVD. Disney did this with Beauty and the Beast. Why not here? This is almost as bad as colorizing black and white movies! <br /> <br />Fans are fans because of the original versions, why fix what isn't broken??  It's really sad and shameful.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I first discovered Radiohead, about 4 months ago and I must admit I think their music is artistic. I think it would be fruitless to write a hostile response to some I disagree with;especially since know one really cares what a reviewer has to say. Which is the point I want to make to you banannaboat. I think you have the right to express your opinion, but I think your approach sux. Its one thing to say u don't like something, and another to be acting like your opinion is the absolute truth. You make it sound like anyone who listens to this band and considers their music good or artistic is an idiot. However I feel u r the idiot on this one. I think their are certain standards which I'm sure u agree with. However in some ways it is relative. Bashing a band and calling all their music crap because it doesn't agree with your ears or because u don't get it doesn't make it valid. And I would not be surprised to hear that u never really took the time to listen to their albums the whole way through because u r impatient and unreasonable. Maybe u have your reasons but u sond uneducated in your approach to music itself. I happen to admire radiohead. At least they don't sound like a lot of the crap that plays on the radio.
B00003CXAT|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite if not my favorite movie of all time. I adore dinosaurus, and this film portrays them greatly, although of course there are faults, the Velociraptors in here are portrayed much larger than their actual real size(6ft long, 3ft tall, and around 40 to 60lbs)Speilberg made them larger to make them look more impressive, mission accomplished I have to say. This movie starts out with a very ominous filling to it and ends with a great scene(my favorite part of the whole film). Sam Neil(Alan Grant)is a fantastic actor and did great. Richard Attenbourough(forgive my spelling) once again shows off his fantastic acting skills here. However it's the dinosaurs who really steal the show, and if you haven't seen it you will be awe struck with the majesty and power in which Speilberg portrays these awesome creatures. For me however the King of the Dinosaurs really stole the show. Tyrannosaurus Rex has always been and will always be my favorite dinosaur of all time. The power in which he brings to the screen is incredible, his awesome power and massive presence is astounding. The Velociraptors are what really brings the fear to the movie, this is a movie however that can only be expierienced by viewing it for your self. The ending remains my favorite part to this day and I never get tired of it. Seeing you favorite dinosaur you love so much truly makes your stomach tingle and fills you with a great amount of pride. Leaving you thinking to yourself(thats my boy their),(laughs), I know thats what I was thinking when the big T came on screen. Truly a great film.
B00005J6UP|5.0|It is hard to predict how this movie will play to somebody who has never seen it, given that it's twenty years old now.  Because I grew up watching this movie, I can only see it through those eyes.  If you aren't familiar with the movie already, all I can say is at least go rent it.  If you are familiar with the movie, I highly recommend this DVD.    I had only seen this movie in the chopped-up Pan-n-Scan format, and seeing the complete film in all its Widescreen glory is great.  The picture quality is amazing compared to my VHS copy recorded off HBO!  :)  Of course the sound is great, too.    The extras list indicates \\"Outtakes\\", which are really Deleted Scenes.  I wanted to clarify this because sometimes they use the word \\"outtakes\\" to refer to Bloopers/Gag Reel.  These Deleted Scenes were very interesting to see.  There's one that's several minutes long and involves the gang stopping by a convenience store and being harrassed by Troy's bunch.  It was also great to finally get to see the octopus scene I had heard so much about.  Fun stuff!    I did not remember the Cyndi Lauper music video, but if you remember it I'm sure this will hold some nostalgic value for you.  Otherwise, it's probably something you will only watch once.    The \\"making of\\" documentary is not new...it was produced around the time of the film's release.  There are some slow spots where the plot is explained for people who haven't seen the movie.  However, there was quite a bit of behind the scenes footage, and the impromptu interviews with Richard Donner and the cast are fun to watch.    The best of the extras is the VIDEO commentary with Donner and the gang.  Corey Feldman is really annoying, but if you can stomach his antics, the commentary is really enjoyable.  The group has a good comradery and it's great to hear them reminiscing about the film.  Best of all, you get to SEE them doing the commentary.  It's great to see what the cast looks like fifteen years later.  This is a GREAT featurethat I wish more DVDs included.    Donner; the man responsible for \\"The Omen\\", \\"Maverick\\", \\"Scrooged\\", \\"Conspiracy Theory\\", \\"Superman: The Movie\\", and the \\"Lethal Weapon\\" movies; put together a movie here that's great fun to watch, even twenty years later.  Again, if you like the movie, I highly recommend the DVD.  If you haven't seen it yet, what are you waiting for?
B00028HBKM|1.0|Mel Gibson has done it again, but THIS time he bloodied Jesus Christ for personal gain!  Yikes, the movie was bad.  But then, I didn't go into it believing it was anything else but a MOVIE.  Made by Actors, Screenwriters, etc., and a product of Gibson's bloody mind.  As for a deep, religious experience, I'm not too lazy to open up my Bible and read the word of God.  That's moving and uplifting for any soul.  This MOVIE, let me say that again, this MOVIE, is so violent it's just sad.  So the Pope endorsed an \\"R\\" rated movie.  It figures!
0425188809|5.0|I happened to come across Watchers when it was mentioned in an issue of DogFancy. It seemed interesting enough, so I bought it. I never realized that it would be this good! I'm only 17, but I've read plenty of books, and by far Watchers is one of the best. The story got me hooked right from the beginning. The suspense in this novel is amazing. I was at the edge of my seat throughout the whole thing. Koontz does an excellent job making each character unique and I've become so attached to the main characters. I definitely recommend Watchers to anyone who loves a good book. Whenever I finish a chapter, I can't put the book down and end up staying up as late as I can reading it. The action, romance, mystery, and suspense is enough to give this book 10 stars, though I can only give it a 5.
B000002UA7|3.0|At the time of its release, \\"The Whole Story\\" certainly made a lot of sense from a record company standpoint. \\"Hounds of Love\\" had just been a comparatively-smash success, spinning off a number of impressive singles. At the same time, Kate's contract with EMI was drawing to a close. \\"The Whole Story\\" is that inevitable contract-fulfillment record that was issued and, likely, quickly forgotten. <br /> <br />It isn't a *bad* compilation, per se. Many of the bonafide hits are present, although one in re-recorded form (we'll get to that in a second); other reviewers correctly note, though, that Kate's successes vary wildly by region, so many charting songs in other territories are missing here. Regardless, if it had a promo video made, it's likely represented on \\"The Whole Story.\\" Better yet, almost every track is a winner, and the obligatory 'new song' of the bunch is surprisingly solid.  <br /> <br />So what's the problem? Like many other old Hits collections that get ported to CD, \\"The Whole Story\\" doesn't provide much bang for the buck; like Smash Hits or The Association's \\"Greatest Hits,\\" it feels like an afterthought more than a comprehensive collection. Worse, \\"The Whole Story\\" costs about as much as any one of Kate's five (yes, five) EMI catalogue albums, and sounds slightly worse than the already-just-OK 80s CDs of those titles (it's probably compiled from the dubbed analogue master). Why bother? <br /> <br />And then there's the remix of Kate's signature track, \\"Wuthering Heights.\\" Kate notes in an interview that the remix--with its new vocal--was an attempt to \\"de-70s\\" the original track, while simultaneously moderating the odd vocal stylings of the hit single. Your enjoyment of the remix relies on believing that a 1986 aesthetic is inherently superior to a 1978 aesthetic. Gone is the screetchy vocal, alright, and IN is a bizarre, cavernous sound, complete with hilariously-80s drum treatments. It feels silly, arbitrary, and poorly produced; it's the album's only clear misfire. <br /> <br />Verdict? There are rumblings of a Kate reissue programme in the wings, which would almost surely involve a revamped version of this title. For the time being, skip it, and instead find one of her excellent albums, most of which are easily found used for bargain-basement prices. You'll be happy you did.
0767834739|5.0|When you glance at many of the sequels to good movies, you would say that the sequel should have never been made. In this situation, this way of thinking is not the case at all! Milla Jovovich returns in this sequel to \\"Resident Evil\\" as Alice. She does such an amazing job with her character and was more than willing to do many of her own stunts during the filming of this movie. Another aspect that many gamers will find appealing is the fact that this movie is even more like the video game. Also, on that note, Nemesis looked absolutely amazing in this film. I loved what they had done with his character and (a personal favorite of mine) Nemesis' weapons. It totally took my breath away to see how well Nemesis was done for this movie. It was truly amazing. Non-stop action throught the movie. If you are in for one non-stop action ride, then \\"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\\" is the movie for you to enjoy.
B00005JNNL|5.0|THE SEA INSIDE (MAR ADENTRO) is, for this reviewer,  simply one of the most powerful films ever made.  Director Alejandro Amenabar (with co-writer with Mateo Gil) has created a work of such power and beauty that surely it will capture all of the highest awards for which it is nominated.<br /><br />Based on the life of Spanish writer Ramon Sampedro, a man who at age 26 suffered a broken neck from a dive into the sea with subsequent quadriplegia, the story is about life and the sanctity of the gift of being a whole person.  Sampedro lay for nearly thirty years in a bed, able move only his head, requiring assistance for every bodily function except his richly gifted brain and verbal communication - which he was able to transpose to the written word by means of an ingenious pencil/stick held in his teeth.  Having lived the life of a world traveler, a free spirit who chose to squeeze all the beauty of living from his participation in the world, Sampedro finds himself at the mercy of those who attend him and it is his wish to end his life with dignity: he searches for someone who will help him and love him enough to assist his longed for suicide.<br /><br />The major debate over euthanasia or assisted suicide may be the apparent message of this miraculous film, but in the hands of Amenabar and particularly in the profoundly empathetic and multifaceted performance of Javier Bardem as Ramon, THE SEA INSIDE is far more importantly a paean to the joy of living life to its fullest measure.  Ramon, despite his frustrated attempts to convince the courts that he should be allowed to die with dignity, is more concerned with touching the lives and hearts of those with whom he comes into contact.  He lives with his older brother Jose (Celso Bugallo) who adamantly opposes Ramon's wishes to die, his caretaker sister-in-law Manuela (Mabel Rivera) who supports him physically and spiritually, his father Joaquin (Joan Dalmau), and his nephew Javi (Tamar Novas).  Into this warm home Ramon's pleas for assistance bring Gene (Clara Segura) and Marc (Francesc Garrido) who aid his cause and engage a lawyer Julia (Belen Pueda), herself afflicted with a degenerative disease that leaves her with a partially paralyzed leg.  Manuela shows Julia Ramon's poetry and upon reading the poems Julia realizes he must be published  - and that she is falling in love with Ramon.<br /><br />One very simple person (Rosa - played by Lola Duenas) hears about Ramon's plight on a television interview and pledges herself to change Ramon's view of living. She visits him, beings him the simplicity of her heart, cares for him and tries to convince him that he should choose life over death.  Ramon's answer to his insight that Rosa is falling in love with him is to inform her that the person who truly loves him will help him exit the world with dignity.<br /><br />The span of the film takes over a year of the interplay of these people with Ramon's one wish and that wish becomes a cause celebre in Spain, even to the point of Padre Francisco (Jose Maria Pou), himself a quadriplegic, making a house call to present the Church's stance on euthanasia - a discourse separated by too steep stairs that is one of the more comical highlights of the story!  After failures in the courts and in convincing his family to assist him, Rosa ultimately comes to Ramon's rescue and it is this final journey that exemplifies the radiance of this film's achievement.<br /><br />Javier Bardem has become one of the finest, most sensitive, technically brilliant and intelligent actors on the screen today.  His performance is nothing short of miraculous: how this actor can create such a compleat character when all he has to use is his facial expression, his eyes, and his eloquent voice goes beyond any expectation a viewer might have.  Likewise, the work of the entire cast is not only the best ensemble acting achievable, but each of these gifted actors has created richly faceted performances that are utterly amazing.  Here is some of the finest acting you'll likely see in any film from any country.<br /><br />The cinematography captures both the claustrophobia of Ramon's Galician house and his visions/dreams of taking flight out his window to embrace his beloved sea.  The musical score is by Amenabar with a little help from Wagner, Mozart, and Puccini.  This is one of those rare films when the audience sits stunned and tearful while the credits roll at the end, not wanting to leave the aura of the experience. There is much to admire and to absorb in this brilliant film.  Were there 10 stars to award it, that would be the ranking.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harply amazing.

068987474X|5.0|i wish i had read this book way before i met this guy that i have dated for 9 months and then dumped me on christmas eve. i asked him out and i always sent him text messages. i gave him everything and then he just dumped me for my younger, fatter neighbor! and i mean neighbor, like across my street. this started when i didnt call him for about a week. i think he got really mad or something. or maybe even wondered why i suddenly changed. that lazy dumb ass. he couldve asked me out instead if he was into me. he always told me that he cared. And then when i saw him with my fat neighbor he just ignored me as if we never dated! and i didnt even know why he would ignore me! i didnt do anything! i wish i never did anything in the first place from the start. Had i read this book before i met him, i probably wouldnt have suffered so terribly. i regret everything. girls, read this book and save yerselves! damn.
0312995423|1.0|Dan Brown's Digital Fortress is an unfortunate attempt at throwing together a quick and dirty thriller novel.  It seems as if throughout the novel he uses tidbits of information gathered off a single website regarding internet and computer security systems.  Given the amount of research that went into THE DA VINCI CODE (which borrowed in part from ANGELS AND DEMONS), the \\"research\\" in this book is embarrassing.  Grabbing snippets of geekspeak and hacker terms and molding it to a weak plot did not make the book a techo-thriller.  It made it look rather confused and disjointed.  The technical inaccuracies (confabulations) aside (the book was full of them), the lack of proper character development as well as the choppy flow of the action in the book made me think this was Dan Brown's first attempt at writing.  What went wrong, Dan?
B00005JMYI|3.0|A lover of Ferril's past work, of Ben Stiller flicks, and all stupid humor-containing, SNL, Mad TV type of material, I am highly disappointed with \\"Anchorman\\".  There were some great angle and jokes, and I did laugh.  But, the pace of the story, the appearance of Tim Robbins (everyone else who showed up has a history and reason for being in a Will Ferril flick), and the terrible ending killed the party.  Come on, Will!   <br /> <br />I'm also a 70's afficianado.  I thought \\"Starsky & Hutch\\" was well-done.  This whole concept of \\"Anchorman\\" had so much potential.  Whoever green-lighted the final script ought to be sent to UPN or PAX. <br /> <br />I'm surprised to see Christina Applegate, as talented and beautiful as she is, involved with such a terrible script. <br /> <br />3 stars for the gags that stand on their own, though, especially the star-studded, minus one, \\"anchorman rumble\\" in the back alley and Applegate in skirts.
B00005JNEI|3.0|Truly great example of how to take half truths and try to present them as having some basis in truth. A great piece of radical left propaganda. Now I know why Mr. Moore helped the Republicans to sweep into office. Well worth watching to understand how out of touch the left is with people in the red counties.
B0001V6ZJ8|5.0|I don't want to offend anyone, but the reason this wonderful film arrives in full screen on dvd, is because it was shot that way.  The very first widescreen movie was \\"The Robe\\", 1953.  So any film which you buy on DVD before 1953 will be a 4:3 aspect ratio.  We as movie going fanatics back then didn't know any better.  \\"The Robe\\" was produced in widescreen as a way of drawing people back into movie houses, since theater goers were staying home to watch old movies on 4:3 televisons.    So, if you're upset about the aspect ratio of this DVD, feel better about it.  There never was a widescreen version of this movie.  Enjoy it for lush sets and wonderful performances, all directed by a man who knew exactly how to use every single inch of a 4:3 screen, John Huston.  He made some of the greatest movies ever produced in that aspect ratio, and this is one of them.
0446614459|1.0|what a shame - I really enjoyed Baldacci's previous books, and found them to be well written and engrossing, and most of all, believable.  This one is too over the top - the characters are too stiff and wornout, and it has the most ridiculous and over-the-top unbelievable plot I've ever read - it reminded me of a Scooby-Doo plot line, it was that ridiculous.  David, next time don't just punch the clock and mail it in - your fans don't appreciate it. <br />
0060555661|5.0|Why another review of the already famous and much reviewed book ? The phrase \\"The definitive book ...\\" in the title seems like an advertising gimmick added by the publisher but I think that is not exaggerated. It is even not overstated to call it \\"stock market bible\\" (though this is also an advertising-sale blip by the publisher; Graham might not be happy with this because through out the book, his words are full of cautions and humbleness).    The book sets a clear goal at the beginning and follows it thoroughly. These are Graham words: \\"little will be said about the technique of analyzing\\", \\"attention will be paid chiefly to investment principles and investor attitude\\". And that is exactly what it's about. It's a about a philosophy, an attitude rather than a guide to show one how to analyze and pick particular stocks. Those who comment that the book contains out of date ideas and examples simply do not appreciate the main theme of the book (should one say Aesop anecdotes obsolete because he said of obscure metaphors instead of fancy ones in the modern world?). And even Graham said: \\"the underlying principles of sound investment should not alter from decade to decade, but the application of these principle must be applied to significant changes in the financial mechanism and climate\\". Thus, the particular application should change to adapt with the current economy situation (e.g, the arrival of tech and biotech, nanotech stocks; new tax and new corporate law; new analysis method e.g. beta analysis,etc...) but the principle of investing still remains (an analog: even with the discover of general relativilty of Eistein, who would say Newton's law is obsolete ?) I do not argue whether the modern efficient market theory (which is what is tough at business schools) is conflict with what the book said but rather, I want to emphasize the book investment principle.      Graham principles stand the test of time because it is full of wisdom. He carefully define what investment is: \\"operation is one which, upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and an adequate return\\", which clearly distinguish between investors and speculators (to understand a matter deeply, one needs to understand the definition.) Can the Graham principles be proved (like a math equation e=mc^2) ? No. But, accept it like a proposition of investing. (somewhat like the proposition in relativity theory).    All said, this is a book about investment philosophy (not \\"how to make million\\" books, not \\"how to analyze stock\\" book, not how to pick stock book). The book is full of wisdoms and if one understands and applies these wisdoms, he or she will be better off, not only in investing but other aspects of life as well, because it's the philosophy. Wisdoms are said by wisemen, mostly old, so it's harder to appreciate by younger one unless one has experienced through the same situations.    Extra: The essay by Warren Buffet is an interesting read for lay man to illustrate the point of the book.    This is the one investment book to own if one can own only one.    Update 12/2007: 3 years have passed. With the all the troubles in the market right now (economy could slow down to a stand still, housing market slumps, credit market crises), it appears to me that the wisdoms of Graham are true than ever. He was through the Great Depression and recovered. We had been through the 2000 bubble and possibly will go through the oil bubble, the credit crises in 2008 and I am, for one, so glad that I have a chance to have read this book.
B00005JMUL|5.0|The Polar Express is an adaptation of a beloved children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. The plot follows \\"Hero Boy\\", who lies awake on Christmas Eve contemplating the existence of Santa Claus. All of a sudden, the calm of the holy night is distrupted by the appearance of a train that is ready to take him to the North Pole. Once he makes the decision to board the train, the adventure begins.  <br /> <br />Like any short story that is transferred to the big screen, the filmaker must expand upon the original story to have enough content to fill a full-length feature film time slot. In this case, some extra characters are added on the train, to give the film a little more depth. Some of these, particularly the hero girl, worked. Others, such as the hobo, seem like an ill-conceived addition. The confusing interplay of these different characters threatens to undermine the original premise of the movie. <br /> <br />So why does this film still rate as 5 stars? Quite simply, because of the sense of WONDER it creates. The exquisite animation and storybook feel to an action film leaves an indelible mark upon the senses. The wonder and beauty of the Christmas season is markedly visible on the screen.
B00003CXCT|3.0|Overall, the DVDs were wonderful. It's nice to finally have a copy of \\"Star Wars that isn't on a dying VHS tape. I was annoyed by the fact that the DVDs are of the Special Edition and not the original. What's more, a new line in ESB and new shots in the end of ROTJ were added to connect the original movies to the less classic prequels.   <br /> <br />I don't think I would have minded the changes as much if Lucas had not inserted Hayden Christensen into the victory celebration, replacing the original actor for Anakin. For those, like me, who do not like the prequels, this change was very upsetting. <br /> <br />I'm very angered by the fact that there does not seem to be a classic \\"Star Wars\\" anymore; just George Lucas's new, technologically advanced version.  These DVDs would have been more of a success if they had the option of watching the original or special edition. Call me crazy, but some people enjoy seeing ancient special effects and singing Ewoks. That's what made this trilogy a classic in the first place. Hey, if \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" can have three movie versions on one disc, than why not \\"Star Wars?\\"  <br /> <br />
B000021Y77|5.0|Ever since MTV arrived on the scene back in the early 1980s, the attention span of Americans has dropped like a stone. The mindless superficiality of the programming hasn't helped boost IQ scores, either, but I won't get into that here. MTV's propensity for rapid-fire programming, replete with jump cuts and other fast editing techniques, eventually found a home in the moviemaking business. Unfortunately, the use of these methods became commonplace, often relegating if not downright replacing such tried and true formulas like plot, character development, and dialogue. Throw in a cut every few seconds, the reasoning must have went, and it gives the audience the impression that the action is more immediate and exciting. In more than a few cases these new techniques worked effectively, usually in films that still adhered to the old ideas of centering the film on the characters and the script. The first \\"Matrix\\" film comes to mind as an example of a movie that successfully fused the new editing with traditional film practices. Another film that works just as well is \\"Run Lola Run,\\" a low budget German film written and directed by Tom Tykwer and starring the amazing actress Franka Potente.<br /><br />The plot of \\"Run Lola Run\\" is surprisingly simple. Lola (Potente) must find a way to come up with 100,000 deutsche marks in twenty minutes or her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) will have some serious explaining to do. He took a job for a big time crime boss involving the sale of a bunch of stolen cars but accidentally left the money on the train. A bum stumbled over the bag of cash and walked off with it before Manni could stop him. If Lola can't find a way to replace the bag of money, Manni tells her on the telephone, he will go across the street and rob a supermarket. Losing the money is that serious of a matter, apparently. Twenty minutes. With no time to lose, Lola dashes out of her apartment and runs across town to see her banker father, hoping against hope that he will somehow loan her the money. Yeah right. This guy has his own worries involving a female employee and he isn't about to drop everything to help his troublesome daughter. Lola dashes on, but through circumstances beyond her control arrives too late to stop Manni from committing a robbery. Will tragedy ensue because of her tardiness? Will the crime lord arrive on the scene and bust her boyfriend up for his lackluster handling of the assignment?<br /><br />\\"Run Lola Run\\" answers these questions in different ways because once Lola arrives at the supermarket, the movie starts over at the point when she hangs up the phone after finding out about Manni's quandary. That's right, we see the same event begin again with a slightly different variation and outcome. Once again, Lola dashes across town to visit her recalcitrant father in order to beg him for a loan. Once again, her father is dealing with his own problems concerning a female employee. But the encounter between father and daughter is slightly changed. So is the ultimate outcome of the eventual Lola/Manni reconciliation. Then the film STARTS AGAIN at the point where Lola hangs up the phone after learning about Manni's predicament. Again, she dashes across town to visit her father in order to seek his assistance with the couple's fiscal problems. And again, her father is dealing with his own issues. And again, many events change from the previous versions. Three separate times Lola dashes across town to save her boyfriend, with the ending of each variation differing significantly from the previous version of events.<br /><br />\\"Run Lola Run\\" uses everything from animation to fast editing to a thundering soundtrack in order to create a sense of dire urgency, and it works spectacularly. You'll be sitting on the edge of your seat wondering how Lola will overcome the obstacles in her way, or even if she can overcome them. Tykwer gives the film additional depth by occasionally showing us, through a quick series of stillphotographs, what happens in the future to various people Lola runs into or passes by on her journey through town. A woman pushing a baby stroller and a lady walking down the hallway in the bank are just two examples of this interesting technique. Obviously, their fate changes in each version. The inclusion of intriguing concepts like this and others highlights the fickle connections between each living person on the planet. We've all thought along these lines before, usually when something disastrous happens and we say something like \\"If I had only turned left instead of right, I wouldn't have wrecked my car.\\" \\"Run Lola Run\\" simply poses this question on a larger scale by showing how an event could change based on one or two minor variations in the actions of a character. If the movie's existential ponderings prove too much for you, you can sit back and enjoy Franka Potente's performance as the grungy, red headed Lola. She's a real hoot, with a voice capable of shattering glass when she screams.<br /><br />Extras on the disc include an informative, fun commentary with Tykwer and Potente, a music video with a brunette Potente singing a song, cast biographies, and trailers for \\"Run Lola Run,\\" \\"The Dreamlife of Angels,\\" and \\"Orlando.\\" There are a few problems with the story, such as the nonsensical scene when the cops refuse to let Manni reenter the train to get his money. Why would they do that? Because the script needs that bag of money out of Manni's hands, that's why. Yet despite a few logical problems, \\"Run Lola Run\\" is a heck of a film everyone can enjoy.f still photographs, what happens in the future to various people Lola runs into or passes by on her journey through town.

0764574124|5.0|I needed to quickly do a macro for a large Excel workbook. Although I have programmed off and on for thirty years, I have done little with VBA.<br /><br />One night with this book was all that it took to learn the basics; and I completed the project the following day with only brief use of one other VBA reference book. As noted by another, Wallenbach is the best-known author of books on VBA for Excel and writes with a pleasant style - friendly enough but little of the silliness of some introductory books.<br /><br />The book is written for those with good familiarity with Excel but with little or no prior programming experience. It seems also to be a good quick-start or overview for those with more experience.<br /><br />Code samples are quite short and can be downloaded from the web. There is no CD. You must have Excel 2000 or later. (The book itself was published in 2004. VBA for Excel has changed little since the Excel 2000 version.) You may want Wallenbach's 1018-page \\"Excel 2003 Power Programming with VBA\\" or other general reference for heavy-duty VBA work, although of course the on-line Microsoft documentation for VBA is very, very extensive.<br /><br />VBA is of course very similar to its big-brother, the general-purpose language, VB.NET. If you are new to programming and enjoy this book, you can move on to VB.NET easily. Hey, you're not writing macros with VBA, you're programming!!
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I went into watching this film not knowing too much about it.  I was originally expecting a pure comedy, but that's not what it is. <br /> <br />While \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" is predominantly a spoof of \\"Dawn of the Dead\\", it does touch on a variety of different topics in a semi-serious way.  <br /> <br />The title character Shaun is a 29 year old stuck in a dead end job supervising teenage co-workers. He can't seem to get it right with his girlfriend, Liz, and he never goes to visit his mother. <br /> <br />What makes this movie hilarious is that it took an apocalyptic event for Shaun to get his life in gear.  While that doesn't sound funny, it surely is made funny by Simon Pegg's performance as Shaun. <br /> <br />Great dialog, a new twist on a common horror theme, and a little seriousness thrown in make this a great film.  I wouldn't take anyone squeemish to go see it, but all violence is made to look obviously fake and is done in a slap-stick manner. <br /> <br />Catch this one when you can, it's spectacular!
B00005JMXX|3.0|As far as disaster movies go, I thought this one was pretty unrealistic until the \\"day after christmas\\" 2004. I never thought I would actually hear people use the term \\"wall of water\\" in real life. Then I turned on CNN.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|Subtitles vs. Captioning<br />Exactly why couldn't they include English subtitles, along with the English captioning for the hearing impaired? (French subtitles appear to be just that, subtitles, BTW)<br />I do watch quite a few foreign movies, and don't mind subtitles at all, but I really do not need to be told about [HELICOPTER APPROACHING] or [VOICES SINGING JAPANESE] in order to enjoy the movie... it is SUCH a distraction, it gave me a headache the first time around.<br />The only English subtitles available on the disc are for the director's commentary.<br />Totally inexcusable.<br />Absolutely terrible DVD.
B00000JZC4|1.0|If you really enjoy Filter, Short Bus is for you.  This album is total pop.  It'd go nice next to a collection of Shakira and Britney Spears albums.  This album is sooooooo weak.  Weak!  You have been warned.
B000002U82|5.0|Considered the Floyd's greatest work, this album stayed on the Billboard charts for SEVERAL YEARS!  It's one of the highest selling albums of all time!  This is Pink Floyd and Space Rock at it's best.  \\"Money\\" is one of the greatest songs in rock history, \\"Us and Them\\" is haunting and powerful, the female vocals are great as well in \\"Great Gig of the Sky\\". <br />\\"Time\\" is another classic and right up there with \\"Money\\". <br />Someone mentioned that the songs are too long.  That's the beauty of it.  At least you get your money's worth (Money!  It's a drag!). <br />If I had to rank this album, I would put it above their later album, \\"The Wall\\", and it would be right there with \\"Sgt. Pepper\\", \\"Revolver\\", \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\", \\"Physical Graffiti\\", and \\"Blood on the Tracks\\". <br />Buy this album, and Your Life Will Change!
0375703764|3.0|If this is the best horror novel you've read in years... you haven't read many horror novels. <br /> <br />Most of the previous reviews bring up good points about the text.  The primary rule is not to go in expecting much.  If you come from a curious, persistent*, and casual frame of mind, this book will satisfy you deeply.   <br /> <br />To have CRAFTED such a work speaks to the author's tremendous talent, but even this is diminished by the fact that so little of the material that doesn't tie directly into the narrative (i.e., footnotes, especially those which DNE) adds anything to the reader's grasp of the story as a whole. <br /> <br />One neat gimmick that I haven't seen mentioned in any reviews is the self-referentiality of the book, particularly as it relates to Navidson's reading of it.  Things such as this really underpin the book and make it interesting throughout, which is why I thought I'd mention <br /> <br />*you really don't have to be that persistent to read the book.  Upon surveying it briefly in the bookstores, I was somewhat put off by the bizarre typesetting.  These are not as confusing as one first imagines, and do add quite a bit to the flavor of the book - it's one of few I've seen that uses form so extensively to add meaning. <br /> <br />So, I after recalling these things, I almost feel unjust in giving 3 of 5 stars, but when compared to the bulk of books of significance I've read lately, HOL falls a bit short. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, to end on a high note, I would recommend this to anyone who has found themselves intrigued by perusing this volume.  It is accessible, it is refreshing, and it is merit-worthy.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I wasn't sure if it could get too much better, but it did!  Her follow up CD to Let Go was even better than her debut..which I loved also.  If you like any of Avril's songs, you'll love this album! <br /> <br />Take Me Away (9/10)  A great song, she sounds great and its fun to drum along to (pretend..as I have no drumset..lol)  It's a good one. \\"My words are cold, I don't want them to hurt you..\\" <br /> <br />Together (10/10)  Together is an awesome song, I love to sing along with it.  And she sounds great as usual. \\"Together it doesn't feel right at all, together we've built a wall, together holding hands, we'll fall\\" <br /> <br />Don't Tell Me (10/10)  Her catchy single, very girl-power (not in a Spice Girls Way..)  It has a good message.  Love it. \\"Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl, the one who gives it all away\\" <br /> <br />He Wasn't (8/10)  An upbeat, fun song.  I like this fast chorus..It's a cool song. \\"this is when I start to bite my nails, and clean my room when all else fails\\" <br /> <br />How Does It Feel (9/10)  This is a pretty, slower song.  She sounds awesome on it.  Good one! :)\\"How does it feel to be different from me, are we the same?\\" <br /> <br />My Happy Ending (10/10) My favorite song on the Album..so impossible not to sing along with..I LOVE it!  And it's a very Avril song..great! \\"You were everything that I wanted, we were meant to be, supposed to be..but we lost it\\" <br /> <br />Nobody's Home (8/10)  Not a bad song, but not my favorite.  I think there are songs that should have been a single before this one, but its kind of deeper. \\"She wants to go home, but nobody's home..thats where she lies, broken inside\\" <br /> <br />Forgotten (7/10)  This song is alright, I don't like the tune of the chorus..it seems like they just didn't get it right so they settled.  I like some parts of this song a lot though. \\"have you forgotten, everything that wanted?\\" <br /> <br />Who Knows (9/10) Once again, great and catchy.  \\"Who Knows what could happen do what you do, just keep on laughing.  One things true, theres always a brand new day.  I'm gonna live today like its my last day\\"  Cool lyrics <br /> <br />Fall To Pieces (10/10)  Another kinda pretty song, I like it a lot.  It's one of my favorites.  \\"And I don't wanna fall to pieces, I just wanna sit and stare at you\\"  Good song! <br /> <br />Freak Out (10/10) Definitely one of my favorites on this CD...LOVE IT!  And its such a me song, so its great.  \\"I'm gonna close my eyes, I can't watch the time go by, I won't keep it inside, Freak Out leg it go!\\" <br /> <br />Slipped Away (7/10) Sad song about losing a loved one \\"I didn't get around to kiss you, goodbye on the hand\\" <br /> <br />
038533348X|3.0|This is a wacky, swift, many charactered Vonn book, wrapped around his frequent theme of human ridiculousness.     Jonah is the narrator, a man fascinated by the day the Hiroshima bomb was dropped, who sets off to investigate one Feliz Hoenikker, noted scientist and possible \\"father\\" of the bomb. What ensues is a funky, quirky, Vonnegutian swirl of synchronicity, and faux Taosit/Existential philosophy, born as Bokononism.     Cat's Cradle is a quick read, featuring 127 chapters, some a page long, few beyond three pages long. Including Jonah there is Newt, a midget, Mona, the most beautiful woman in the world, the mysterious Bokonon, gruff, crude American's, scientifically bizarre ice-water, a statue lover, a Ukrainian spy, an ex-pat ex-convict major domo, a frozen dog, and the possible end of the world, among others.     Truly a trip through Vonnegut. Through it all though, the essential foolishness and gullability of man is turned up to light.     \\"Of all the words of mice and men, the saddest are 'It Might Have Been.'\\"
B0002Y4T92|4.0|I bought this DVD mainly because I am a blues fan and a Clapton fan, but two things stand out for me: J.J. Cale, who's songs I've always enjoyed but whom I've never actually seen or heard perform before -- seeing him do After Midnight and Call Me The Breeze with Clapton was a definite treat (and I've ordered some Cale for my library!). The other artist that knocked me out was Robert Randolph -- I knew nothing about him, and the way he plays the particular guita he does is excellent. Doyle Bramhall 2nd is also intersting to listen to... <br /> <br />If I have a complaint, it's where are the other artists from the festival? I would have liked to see James Burton...and Jeff Beck...and more from Buddy Guy, who is always entertaining...
B000696PWC|5.0|This CD is totally fantastic. Since Kylie's first album, I have been a huge, loyal and dedicated fan of this most awesome Dance & Singing Queen. All of the tracks are phenominal, especially the song \\"I Believe in You\\". This album is first rate.

B000006TRV|5.0|<br />Pink Floyd The Wall isn't an album. Is a part of everyone's life. Touch many aspect of life, like isolation, alienation, sorrow, lies, broken dreams, marriage, chilhood, self-destruction, etc. That's the reason why The Wall has been, and still is and will be forever, the most important piece of music, even beyond Rock music, from all times. The most finest concept album ever made by a band or an artist. The most powerful lyrics ever written. The most extraordinary music for that lyrics, etc.  <br /> <br />The Wall is an experience. How many albums or artist are really an experience nowadays ? U2 ? they died in 2000... Eminem ? ... Britney Spears ?... Robbie Williams ?... <br /> <br />This is not an album, this is a life experience. <br /> <br />I really hope someday will have Pink Floyd The Wall Live DVD <br />
B00005JNSK|4.0|When Tim Burton and Johnny Depp teams up, they usually provide a darkly entertaining, but enchanting film.  Depp somehow looks great in Burton's dark blue lighting and macabre shapes.  Edward Scissorshand and Sleepy Hollow are some of their signature collaborations so far.  But, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in dark blue and bebop music???  It may work, thanks in part to a very talented Johnny Depp, who was over-the-top in Pirates of the Carribbean.  The technicolor-crazed bright look of the Wilder film  and a too subtle Willy Wonka gave the film a family, almost toy-like feel.  Burton and Dep may just get older audiences like teens to 25 year olds to become fans of children's book author Dahl, who has created some of the most quirkiest characters in literature. On the other hand, it may be a horrible remake like Scooby Doo.  But looking at Burton and Depp's track record with Big Fish and Pirates, I think this film will do just fine.  And Burton is the director to provide the magic to this perennial children's favorite.  Other recommendations:  Lemony Snicket and Harry Potter.
B000001EGA|5.0|This album represents some of the finest evidence of the John/Taupin collaboration. The production of the album is also stellar. Other reviewers have already made many good points, so I won't be redundant to those, but try to offer my own thoughts. While musically and lyrically this album is magnificent, overall this album belongs to Nigel Olssen - Elton's drummer. Nigel provides the punctuation to every phrase both musically and lyrically throught the album. Nowhere is this more evident than the hit song \\"Someone saved...\\" where Nigel kicks in about mid-song and changes the entire emotional feeling of the song. This is true through the whole album. It is only fitting that it is Nigel's drums you are left hearing as the album draws to a close with \\"Curtains\\".<br /><br />I also agree with a previous reviewer - buy the original album, not the one with 'extra' tracks.
B0002IQHY8|5.0|I am always wary of new releases for fear they will disappoint. Not this time. I read the reviews, bought the CD for Christmas and have not stopped playing it. Alan Parsons is simply a genious and A Valid Path is as much a reflection of his past works at it is his new direction. Any criticism that he has gone too techno does not understand the Alan Parsons mission. He has created a set of works here that is provocotive and stunning.  <br /> <br />I am always impressed by his creative ways to bring his past music into his new work and while I am not a techno wizard myself, he hit a home run with his latest release. A Valid Path should remind all AP fans that his mind is as deep as it is pensive. He remains on his game and now I think I will go back and turn it up once again!
B000002KXV|5.0|Steely Dan, one of the greatest bands in history, officially broke up on June 21, 1981, & in October of 1982, Donald Fagen released his debut solo album \\"The Nightfly\\".  Nearly every Steely Dan song was co-written by Fagen & his bandmate/ writing partner Walter Becker, & with all due respect to Becker, \\"The Nightfly\\" conclusively proved that Fagen could write sophisicated & astonishingly brilliant compositions on his own.  In characteristic Steely Dan fashion, the album is loaded with legendary players such as Larry Carlton, Jeff Porcaro, Michael Omartian & many, many others--plus, the album was produced by Gary Katz who had produced all of Steely Dan's official albums up to that time, & \\"The Nightfly\\" is impeccably recorded & *sounds* absolutely divine--it's the kind of album stereo salesmen worship.  As great as the sheer sound of the album is, there's a lot of substance lurking below the surface as well, with excellent lyrics on track upon track.  If you're not familiar with this album, you really should be, because this is indeed a masterpiece.  \\"The Nightfly\\" stands tall & proud next to Steely Dan's best albums and is unquestionably essential for Dan fanatics.  Aside from the cover of Leiber & Stoller's \\"Ruby Baby\\", Fagen wrote every song on here himself, & his knack for incredibly creative, sophisicated, brilliantly realized & ultra-catchy songwriting is in full force.  Also, with this being a solo album, it's fitting that there's a certain warmth & personal/ autobiographical quality to the songs on the album in general, as well as a very wistful feel on several tracks such as the optimistic album-opener \\"I.G.Y.\\" & the smooth, richly-harmonized ballad \\"Maxine\\", both gems.  \\"The New Frontier\\" with its haunting electric piano, the title track with its sly imitation of a radio station jingle, the uptempo \\"Greenflower Street\\", & the merengue-flavored \\"The Goodbye Look\\" are all brilliant as well.  The album closing \\"Walk Between Raindrops\\" is SORT OF a sugary throwaway, but it's still a smile-inducing feel-good tune & a fine way to end the album.  Also, if you dig the funkiness of Steely Dan's music, you'll find that to be strongly in evidence here as well.  Quite simply, \\"The Nightfly\\" is packed with superb, timeless music & is a must-have for any serious listener.
B000069AUI|5.0|I thought that it would be neccesary for everyone that is reading these reviews to know something very important. Rush was mentioned in one of the previouse reviews and they were compared to Coldplay. I laughed when I read this. Nothing on any cd by Coldplay can even be compared rush. The piano in Clocks is unique and out of Rush's league. The notes are very far off from the solo in countdown, the song mentioned. I am an experieced musician and can clearly see the  night and day difference. This cd is out of this world with talent and are in a totally different league than everyone else. Radiohead and U2 are the only people that compare in equality. Coldplay shares nothing with Rush or any other electric guitar or drum driven band.
0767834739|3.0|2 opinions about this movie<br /><br />*** This comment may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />the only way you'll like this movie depends on 2 things.........1 your unfamiliar with the games and/or you just want a good shoot em up zombie movie.but if your a fan of the games your gonna be brought to tears.the only thing that resembles the game are a few action scenes taken away from the games.and 4 characters from the game,jill,carlos,nicholai,nemesis.but their not fleshed out at all.which makes the casual viewer think that they never had depth to begin with which is so far from the truth it isn't funny.<br /><br />also the creepy atmosphere of the game was utterly annihilated in the name of action.which WAS cool but in a cheesy way.nemesis could have been a great character till he turned into a [...] at the end. plus the one on one fight with alice is horrible if it had stayed a gun Battle then it would have been acceptable.<br /><br />umbrella motives isn't fleshed out unlike the games.plus alice is really an intruding character sense she's not in the game she just doesn't fit.she messes up the dynamics of the original resident evil characters.its as if a girl wrote a fan fic and abruptly put herself as the center piece of the story.at least she should have stayed separate from the others going on her own path like another reviewer mentioned.also there's others that don't fit the lil girl,is a rewrite of another character central to the 2nd game,nicholai is also a very important player,as is carlos and Jill and S.T.A.R.S but like i said their not fleshed out.but if you haven't played the games do your own research to see what i'm talking about.because the adaptation inaccuracies are too numerous to mention here<br /><br />now judging the game on its own merits.........if your just looking for a light action shoot'em up slash horror pic this might hold you over.though i must admit that the first movie did have a level of more darkness and tension then this one(though not much).but like i said all in all if your unfamiliar with the games and/or you just want a good shoot em up zombie movie this is for you.but if your a fan of the games your gonna be brought to tears.your unfamiliar with the games and/or you just want a good shoot em up zombie movie this is for you.but if your a fan of the games your gonna be brought to tears.
0767834739|4.0|Picking up the dvd today I had some anticipation that this would be just as good as the first one. I saw this in the theater and it enjoyed it then. This is better than the first movie, which I thought was good. Good story, good acting, good action! <br /> <br />If you are a fan or at least familiar with the video game storyline you will easily pick up the references in this chapter. The first movie was a prequel and this one is taken directly from the source. Watch carefully and you will get them all. <br /> <br />As a movie, this is your big action popcorn movie with some sci-fi in it. If you are a zombie fan you will find there are some tense moments but nothing like Dawn Of The Dead. It only lacks in the tension put out by the game where you can't see beyond a closed door. Other than this setback it is action packed and will keep you going! <br /> <br />Jill valentine makes her first appearance straight from the Resident Evil 2 finally. She adds a nice compliment to alice from the first film. The subplot of Umbrella starts to also come full circle. Very Good! Go rent it or buy it! <br /> <br />

B00005RHF8|1.0|I bought the DVD version of this movie on the recommendation of my wife who loved the version she saw aired in television. But the version put to DVD was a disaster.  <br /> <br />The lighting was poor to non-existent; the film quality was terrible. Reminding me of a VHS tape that had been copied one too many generations.  <br /> <br />Entire scenes were simply excised. In one instance Adele is being put to bed, and we immediately cut to another scene - coming in in mid-sentence - where it's the next night. This happens often throughout the film.    <br /> <br />Characters such as Grace Poole and Mason are never even properly introduced, leaving one to wonder if they'd dozed off for a few minutes during the movie. <br /> <br />The DVD we saw was produced by Platinum Disc Corp and they ought to be ashamed! Even at $6.32 it was a gyp. <br /> <br />Be careful which version of this movie you buy! We're sending this one back.
B000069HKH|5.0|Arguably the best album Bruce has ever released. There, I said it. Now call me crazy but I bet Springsteen would agree with me.  <br />
B00005JMJ4|4.0|When reading the negative reviews of Lost in Translation one usually sees \\"no plot\\" cited as the main weapon of choice. But when one thinks about it you realize the critic really can't come up with the proper words to describe why they don't like the film. Usually the real reason is just boredom. To cite \\"having no plot\\" as a reason for a film to be bad, such as Lost in Translation, is a statement by one who does not understand that all films are not about plot or have to be plot-driven. Martin Scorcese once remarked: \\"If I watch a movie and all I remember is the plot, then the movie failed. If I come out remembering moments, then its a success.\\" <br /> <br />It's all about \\"moments\\" and that's the core of Lost in Translation. <br /> <br />Someone once said that a bad storyteller ends their story with \\"You had to be there.\\" Where as a great storyteller makes you feel like you were. That is Sophia Coppola's, aptly rewarded, success in her original screenplay and film. She takes a subject so insanely difficult to capture and nails it without ever having to succumb to Hollywood cliches and its still memorable and translates to the audience. If you've ever tried to put down into writing a moment in your life that was so deeply, emotionally profound you'll understand why this film is a success. While everything seems so light and trvial on the surface, you know there is so much more brimming underneath. Its normal for some to not get this after just watching the movie once (I too felt a bit underwhelmed), but afterwards one might come off with a feeling of bliss, and then maybe after a second or third viewing one might actually find themselves finally understanding the spell of Lost in Translation.
B00006879E|5.0|Excellent debut album from Maroon 5.  Catchy, feel-good pop songs about life and love.  Great background music when you're driving or when you invite some company over.  If you dig this album you should also check out Dustin Joel in the Music Downloads section of Amazon.  He has a great voice that won't be a secret for long.  His lyrics are more passionate that I've seen in a long time.
B0001Z52RU|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I love thrillers and mysteries. <br />But this movie was just plain bad.  <br />I really don't understand what the fuss is all about. <br />It's just a movie with a plot that's lacking almost every element of what makes an interesting thriller.  <br />Stay away.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I really enjoyed listening to this album.  It has a refreshing sound, with well-written songs and great hooks.  I've also seen him in concert twice, and his live show really shows off his skills on the guitar.  It is definitely worth a listen.  If you're into John Mayer though, I'd check out this up and coming artist Dustin Joel in the Music Downloads section on Amazon.  You can tell that he's had some influence from Mayer, but his music leans more towards the rock genre.  He has an incredible voice and writes deep, meaningful songs.
B000002UA9|5.0|Although they formed as The Quarrymen in 1956 (and later became The Moondogs, The Rainbows, The Beetles, The Silver Beetles, The Beat Brothers and eventually The Beatles) it took this fantastic group several years before they scored a hit record in their own right (they had already backed Tony Sheridan on his 1961 single \\"My Bonnie\\"). It was late 1962 and after many years of trying to \\"make it\\" outside their native British city Liverpool and the German touring circuit they had been successful on, John, Paul, George and Ringo scored their first UK top 40 chart entry with the single \\"Love Me Do\\". The record was a fair success, but didn't impress record bosses and it missed the top 10. It was the follow-up single in early-1963 \\"Please Please Me,\\" when entering the top 3, persuaded the record bosses to get an album out. However, this album had to be out \\"really quick,\\" while their was interest in the band, after all The Beatles were most likely only going to last a couple of months.... <br />The 1st two singles are included here with 12 other songs. The songs were recorded in one day at EMI studios to rush release the record. I doubt The Beatles (and most definitely no one at EMI) would know how important the next few months would be for The Beatles as they rushed through track by track to make the album. <br />The 1st song on the disc is \\"I saw her standing there,\\" a uptempo rocker sung by Paul McCartney, a song he co-wrote with John Lennon and was one of the most popular numbers in the live set. Infact most of these numbers were performed by the Beatles in their early shows.  <br />The album has a varied mix of rockers, ballads, covers and original material and still stands up as one of the finest recordings ever made, despite EMI's attempts to rush the record out while \\"there was still money to be made\\". It was a long day for The Beatles making this disc and Lennon's shouting on \\"Twist N Shout\\" is not intended because of the title of the song, although it may sound that way, but because he was trying to stay awake during the recording session. (At the end of this track you can hear Paul McCartney and George Harrsion cheering, this is because they have completed the album.) <br />This album rose to Number 1 in the UK and the bosses at EMI seemed please with the success, that they wanted another album. After all, Beatlemania wasn't going to last but they might be lucky and make a bit from a follow-up..... <br />
B000066NW0|5.0|Nice rock sound and catchy, radio-friendly tunes make this a must buy.  Also, check out Dustin Joel in the Music Downloads section of Amazon.  He is 20 years old and I think destined to be the next big thing.  I checked out his label Dudebox Records on Yahoo and it looks like they're really trying to shake things up in the music industry.
B00063MBU8|4.0|The music is not much different from their first album, \\"No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls.\\"  Most of the songs have similar themes and background music.  There is one song that is a fresh sound for the band, and that would be \\"Untitled,\\" which uses more piano background and vocals.<br /><br />Now, I bought the CD because I enjoy the sound of the band, so I'm not disappointed in the least.  I love this CD just as much as I love their first one.  In fact, the extras on the DVD were well worth the money!<br /><br />I must say that the DualDisc idea is a good one.  I enjoyed the extra footage and behind-the-scenes items fans are allowed to see with the DVD portion.<br /><br />However, the Audio CD portion of my DualDisc does not work on my computer's player.  It simply spins in the drive and the music can only be played on the DVD version.<br /><br />While this does not seem like a problem, it is for those people who wish to rip the songs to their computer to burn a mix CD or to be able to play it without the CD being present.  Perhaps the producers designed it this way because of the illegal copying of the music, but I just want to listen to the CD on my computer without having to search for the disc!<br /><br />So, if you want to hear more of the Simple Plan boys and to see some excellent behind-the-scenes footage, buy the CD.  If you want to use your computer to run it, be prepared to run into some snags.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril Lavigne may be young still, but her voice is well beyond her years.  There are several great tracks on this album, including a very catchy \\"My Happy Ending\\".  She is sure to have a lasting career as a rock musician.  But she's going to have some fierce competition soon.  I recently listened to this artist Dustin Joel in the Music Downloads section of Amazon and he is young and also has a fantastic voice.  At 20 years old, he writes all his own material as I found out when checking out his label Dudebox Records on Yahoo.

0440180295|5.0|A WONDERFUL read.  This disturbing book should be read, digested, and then re-read.  There is a reason this is considered one of the finest post-World War II American novels...just read it NOW!
B0002X314C|2.0|This album is not very good at all, I was very dissapointed when I listened to this CD. It's going to be one of those CD's where it'll collect dust in my CD case.  I gave it 2 stars because there is only 3 strong songs on the album out of 14 and that's including \\"Used to love you\\".  The rest of the album is not that appealing to me.  It's right up there with Alicia Keyes' album.  So if you want it anyway be my guest, but I'm telling you, it's not all that fantastic.
0393035158|5.0|Wherever you have more than one god you have war, ergo Babylon, ergo religion. This book makes attempts to address some very important topics but it appears as the authors own fears have set the agenda for defining Faith and religion.  I agree that religion is a major contributor to the pollution of our planet, but \\"religion\\" is big part of the human experience, and Sam Harris is simply providing his own version of religion.  And I don't like the misuse of the words Faith or Religion either, it would have been nice if he would have done some homework on these before using the status quo definitions.  Bottom line is this book fuels more circular reasoning which hauls the reader back to Babylon (confusion).  Sorry Sam, but this isn't funny.
B0002X314C|5.0|I totally need to be HEARD NOT NOW, BUT RIGHT NOW! John Legend is absolutely a LEGEND in the making. I have observed this young man work extremely hard for years to push HIMSELF (ALONE). He went on tour before he dropped his release, and he just really got out there and did his thing. I totally will always support a fresh talent when I hear one. Being raised by a musician, I KNOW THE STRUGGLE. John makes this look easy. I could not stop feelin' him. I went psycho, and brought two cd's. This release is a total breathe of fresh air. Your heart, mind, body, and soul will get LIFTED with this release. This could provide your mind with some well needed peace. Please do this man some justice, give him some of your \\"precious\\" time...PEACE TO THE MIDDLE EAST!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have always been a Green Day fan, and have been looking forward to the release of American Idiot for sometime.  While I have noticed that Green Day has grown in their music, American Idiot was something different entirely.   <br />Instead of following the antics of american society and their \\"jack ass\\" attitude (that many so-called punk bands have), Green Day is stating their anger with what is happening in our society.   <br />The nation blindly following a leader because he uses fear to rule a nation.  A rift between generations, sexes, ideas all worked into  pieces that flows like a piece by Puccini. <br />American Idiot is a masterpiece of anger and disgust with our great nation and how we choose to sit back and do nothing about it.  Finally a voice that smacks you in the face to say enough of this and actually do something to stop all the insanity.
B0002X314C|5.0|I first heard John Legend doing background vocals on some Kanye West and Kanye West produced songs and I fell in love with his beautiful voice. I remember telling my mother how good he sounded and that I thought he should definitely go solo and bring something out on his own. And he finally has!!! EVERY song on the CD is beautifully and wonderfully produced, but I have some personal favorites. I love Get Lifted, Alright, Ordinary People, So High, Get Lifted Again and my FAVORITE: Refuge(When It's Cold Outside). I DEFINITELY recommend that everyone buy this CD...it's the perfect mix of soul, R&B, and a teeny bit of gospel. It's wonderful..
B000002KON|5.0|I have read many of the reviews and I must be missing something...  why hasn't anyone mentioned the breathtaking beauty of \\"Young and Innocent Days?\\"  The acoustic guitar outro to that song is a thing of beauty.  I'm listening as I write this, and it's just swirly and magnificent.  As a 23-year-old anglophile, these mid-period Kinks albums have saved my life more than one time. <br /> <br />A word to the wise, however: seek out the 22 track import version, as you get a lot more for the money, and the sound quality of the 2004 reissue is really great.  \\"She Bought a Hat like Princess Marina\\" proves the claim that Ray Davies was Britain's Brian Wilson who had never seen the surf. <br /> <br />Happy listening!
B0006399FS|4.0|I like u2 because of their unique sound and for their unwavering integrity.  Of those two things I just mentioned, sound is the only one that ever changes.  I've followed them through their \\"experimental\\" albums with patience.  My patience has been rewarded. <br /> <br />If Rattle & Hum was heavily influenced by Bono, then this album has The Edge stamped all over it.  His re-imbrace of the unique sound that made the group classic is fine with me.  I don't see it as back-pedaling; I view it more as solidification.  Better than their last, I highly recommend this album.
B00008973Q|4.0|Just recieved this DVD for Christmas... watched it last night. <br /> <br />Before watching \\"Ran\\", I read the Amazon online reviews - and thus, it gave me a sort of \\"bias\\". Let me explain... <br /> <br />First of all, I read the mentionings of the high contrast and saturation - while it may be a bit too much at times, it's nothing to make your experience any less enjoyable. The only thing I found bothersome about the \\"Masterworks Edition\\" is that the subtitles are hard to read at some points (because of said contrast/saturation blunder) - at the opening scene in the plain, for example. <br /> <br />Secondly, there's mentionings of the aspect ratio being wrong (not wide enough). I never noticed that anything being \\"cut out\\". But then again, this is the first (and only) version of Akira Kurosawa's \\"Ran\\" that I've seen. <br /> <br />That being said, let me talk about the actual movie. It's got Kurosawa's beautiful cinematography, wonderful use of light and shadow (which, by the way, would probably NOT be seen without the \\"remastering\\"), great character development - the usual from Kurosawa-san. As mentioned in an earlier review, he does an almost better job of telling King Lear's tragedy than Shakespeare himself. <br /> <br />The DVD extras include 2 trailers (Euro and VHS), web links, production notes, and 2 commentaries. <br /> <br />*Interesting side note* The film is also based \\"loosely\\" on Mori Motonari and his three sons, but unlike in \\"Ran\\", the family stayed aligned - even after loosing more than half their land. <br /> <br />Hope you enjoy the movie - I would suggest buying it if you're a fan - if this is your first Akira Kurosawa movie, check out \\"Seven Samurai\\" first.  <br /> <br />Although \\"Ran\\" can be a bit tedious on the eyes (subtitles vs film contrast), it's a beautiful film. Kurosawa-san's use of the clouds' shadows wouldn't be viewable without the \\"Masterworks Edition\\". It's very detailed. <br /> <br />Akira Kurosawa's \\"Ran (Masterworks Edition) DVD\\"gets 4/5 stars - 5 stars for the movie, 4 stars for the DVD.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|If I could give this movie 0 stars I would. This movie was the most boring, rascist movie ever. They categorize mexicans as inferior, short, ignorant,dark skinned(like it's a bad thing), cholo type people, with accents and they are not all like that. I was outraged! Not all mexicans are boot-wearing \\"vaquero\\" , mustached looking FREAKS! This is the most low quality film! No wonder MTV made it! This is MTV's attemp on a good comedy film was worthless.Trust me it's absolutely not funny your just wasting your time watching this as I have wasted mine If you want a funny film watch a Jackie Chan film. <br />DO NOT WATCH IT! <br /> <br />The rasicim was not just on mexicans It was on all kinds of people fat, white... <br />And some people are saying that the music is good Backstreet boys, larger than life,HA those days are over.
B000001E18|4.0|It took me some time for the music on this album to sink in and for me to appreciate it, but I came to love it. It's another wonderful U2 album, though a depressed one.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|Sometimes I think I go out of my way not to like DT. I have every disc, I have seen them live a dozen times, and yet I still think they peaked with \\"Awake\\".  <br /> <br />There is nothing wrong with this disc... Their talent is front and center on every track, the playing is top-notch, the songs are thoughtful and likeable... but I keep wanting to hear something different from them. How about mixing up some other influences here? You can't tell me that the only music James and the boys have ever listened to is Rush & Metallica.  <br /> <br />I honestly have a hard time, even after almost a year of listening, telling these tracks apart. And some of the melodies and jams and riffs and fills I swear I've heard on previous discs. <br /> <br />From a production and performing standpoint they are a ton better than their early albums, but from a writing standpoint, they are in a huge rut. <br /> <br />anyway, these kind of reviews seldom resonate since the only people who read the reviews for DT music are die-hard fans. So buy it/rip it and enjoy...
B000001FKY|5.0|Do not buy this CD expecting it to sound like Pyromania.  Why you ask? Because it's completely different than Pyromania.  Of course this still goes under the genre of rock but this is big-time POP metal.  Different drums and vocals which any teenage chick living in the 80's would die for.  No wonder there were 7 singles off of this 12 song CD.  Pyromania is straightforward kickass rock and roll.  Hysteria is vastly different.  Longer songs, more complex song structures, and insanely good production which is why you manage to hear everything going on in the background in songs like &quot;Rocket&quot;.  I listened to it a couple times and have to admit that it was pretty good....considering it was POP.  BUT, this was the 80's so rock was pop.  Unlike today with crap bands and all the losers who dream of being like Usher or Alicia Keys. Get this CD.  Does not disappoint.
B000005RFV|4.0|Coming out from a law-suit after their label change and a huge line-up change, which leaves legendary guitarist-songwriter Kai Hansen out of the band, Helloween come back with \\"Pink Bubbles Go Ape\\". A record bashed by music critics due to the fact that the band changed their music, to a small effect, when compared to their highly praised Keeper Of The Seven Keys records. All in all a memorable album, with several highlights and a stronger release compared to several of the band's future outputs.    \\"Pink Bubbles...\\" admitably has a really strange, even silly title but this is not the case with the song writing. The music departs a bit from the continuous double-bass power metal stile and is enriched with blues and rock influences and some more mainstream ideas as well. Some songs are softer than the usual tracks found on the Keeper records, reminding more of heavy metal than power metal, but that's not a drawback for sure.    Without diving into each and every song, I'm going to name only the outstanding ones! \\"Mankind\\" is a great epic and progressive song, with wonderful vocal and musical variations. \\"The Chance\\" is a mid-paced heavy metal anthem, which contains some of the album's best vocals, an infectious chorus and is the most known track from this release. \\"Someone's Crying\\" is the only song that could be categorized as pure power metal (fast double-base drumming), a truly memorable song with fast guitar solos, which reminds of the band's previous ouputs. \\"Kids of the Century\\" is another fast song with clever lyrics, another great chorus and outstanding guitar solos. Finally, \\"Your Turn\\" is a beautiful rock-blues ballad with amazing vocals.    The new guitarists Roland Grapow proves to be a worthy replacement, as his guitar playing is outstanding and he also contributes some great tracks to the album. Vocalist Michael Kiske has improved even more in both technicality and vocal control, delivering his best vocal performance up to that point. While the other 3 band members, especially bass player Markus, continue to show how talented musicians they are.    The drawbacks of this album are the production, which is kind of weak, making the vocals and the drums stand out above the rest (there is an EXPANDED-remastered edition available!). The other drawback being songs Heavy Metal Hamsters, Pink Bubbles Go Ape and I'm Doing Fine Crazy Man.    You should definitely give this album a chance, if you enjoyed Helloween's previous releases, as you can hear how the band progresses and doesn't continue repeating itself for the sake of record sales.     (The Expanded edition includes 4 bonus tracks and offers a great improvement of sound quality)
B00067ZONA|4.0|The liner notes state that die-hard Genesis fans likely won't have all the tracks in this compilation. That's a bold statement, bolstered by the observation that there are three stratified legions of Genesis fans, delineated by two milestones: Peter Gabriel's departure in 1975 and the advent of the hitmaking Genesis of the 1980s-1990s. Consequently, most folks aren't conversant with the group's entire output. In that spirit, however, this review focuses on pre-1980 material: specifically, the remixes, which are of greatest attraction to die-hard fans.    First, cuts from And Then There Were Three, Wind And Wuthering and Trick of the Tail, not lacking sonically in the least, now are opened up to IMAX proportions. That was an unexpected bonus.    There is a bobble at \\"Lamb:\\" the remixes seem strident and too much \\"in your face,\\" lacking the enveloping warmth of the original. Minus one star. Hopefully, the upcoming, promised re-release of The Lamb won't succumb to this problem.    Continuing along, the remixes improve inversely with the age of the material. Previous releases were sonically compressed; here, they are given a new life. Songs from \\"Selling England,\\" in original recordings, didn't lack for dynamics, but now are jaw-droppingly etched and three-dimensional. Guitar is treated lovingly in the mix. This trend is amplified with The Musical Box and The Knife. Peter Gabriel's vocals are crisp and clear, and the entire band finally is in the room. Lyrics in The Knife are intelligible and riveting, and the last few phrases of that song stand prescient and chilling, given current events.    The songs were remixed at The Farm, Tony Banks' studio; songs chosen for remixing, not surprisingly, also feature prominent keyboard parts. That said, if this compilation is successful, hopefully those involved will consider remixing and rereleasing the entire back catalog, in segments matching the above fan stratification. Call them Bronze, Silver and Gold, if you like.    If youare an earlier-era Genesis fan, and would like a new take on old recordings, this compilation won't disappoint. The later material is a bonus, and I suspect a sneaky motivation for this release is to unite the above factions, and allow all folks to gain a better appreciation of this band's decades-long and considerable musical accomplishments.
B00008A7QK|5.0|Electric Warrior was the first album I ever bought back in 1971 and more than 30 years on is still my favourite album of all time.  Every track was worthy of being single material, even my brother who was a Stones fan appreciated many of the tracks. My favourite Bolan track is Jeepster, it was a great single and sadley kept off the Christmas number one spot by Benny Hill of all people.  For anyone wanting to get in to T.Rex, Electric Warrior is the best one to start with, it is his best work.  Then probably move on to the Slider and Tanx, then I have to say that you'd have to be a true Bolan fan to buy his later work, personally they were very hit and miss, and at the time of his death in 1977 the press were raving how Marc had got his act back together and was on the verge of a comeback, sadley we will never know.  I have to say that 30 years on I really enjoy his Tyrannosaurus Rex stuff.  Marc Bolan got me in to pop music, I remember seeing him on Top of the pops in 1970 dressed in a leapard skin outfit singing ride a white swan, I'd never seen anything like him before, Marc was a god, he is an icon and argueably paved the way for people like Bowie, Roxy music and Elton John.  Probably the nearest thing to Marc since is Adam Ant.  This is a great album, buy it because I don't think you will be disapointed.

B000002MP2|4.0|After two indie records, Green Day was signed to Reprise Records in 1993 and the following year released the worldwide smash hit album Dookie. Featuring many hit songs this album was said to have reborn the Punk genre in the mainstream, that of course depending on your definition of Punk, much the same way that Nirvana's Nevermind spark the Grunge revolution. While the impact this album has had on numerous pop-punk bands has been well noticed since its release ten years ago, the album itself is not Green Day's best. Yes the four major singles are classic Modern Rock Radio hits and some of the other songs are also good, it doesn't compare to Green Day's follow up Insomniac and their last two records Warning and American Idiot. Still from an historical perspective a landmark album but the songs besides the singles are not as good as what they might have been.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|At first it was easy for me to dismiss this film as a Wes Anderson knock-off after all the hype it received during its intial theatrical yet limited release. However after watching this film again I have had a change of heart. This film in a nutshell is a filmakers loveletter to his childhood and hometown. So who else better to star in it than the director and writer. After several short films of the same context the idea of Napoleon Dynamite comes to full tilt here. A bit tweaked however a bit more fulfilled. Awesome movie.
B000002N2P|4.0|Following Dookie returned in 1995 with the harder hitting Insomniac. In many ways this album has what Dookie was missing on a lot of it's songs, better playing and better lyrics from Billie Joe Armstrong. Also almost all of the songs could have been hit singles, well except Panic Song, as the A.D.D. generation would lose track around the midway part of the incredible instrumental opening. A great record that is worth buying but is just short of the perfect mark.
1400032717|4.0|Fifteen-year-old Christopher Boone has a supremely logical mind. He knows all the prime numbers up to 7,057 and can solve puzzles that stump PhDs. However, he cannot understand metaphors, jokes, or human emotion. Christopher has Asperger's Syndrome, a form of autism. When his neighbor's dog turns up brutally murdered, Christopher puts his supreme logic to work in solving the mystery. However, he doesn't get far before the clues he is uncovering point to the mystery of his parents' separation and a world of adult emotion and motivation that is challenging him for him to understand.  <br /> <br />I was impressed by the creation of such an utterly believable narrator and the author's insight into his disability. It wasn't a story about Christopher; the story really WAS Christopher. Right down to prime numbers for the chapter titles. I felt like I knew this kid. And because I cared about him so early on, for the most part, the tangential style didn't bore me. I found it interesting because I found the workings of the narrator's mind interesting (at least at first -- more on this later). The author obviously has a great deal of empathy for kids with perceptual disabilities. He understands the details of how their minds work and, more importantly, he respects them and their process. Christopher, at times, seems hyperaware of his own brain processes (e.g. describing his mind as like a computer doing a search). But then, at times, he's wrong -- for example, saying that he can't fantasize about things that haven't happened when he does this a lot, such as fantasizing about being an astronaut or imagining who might have killed Wellington. <br /> <br />Simplicity is the book's greatest strength, I think. Christopher is profound because he doesn't try to be -- he just tells the truth and people with \\"normal\\" perceptual abilities see the depth of what he's saying (I underlined: \\"Prime numbers are what is left when you have taken all the patterns away. I think prime numbers are like life. They are very logical but you could never work out the rules, even if you spent all your time thinking about them.\\") In the same way, Christopher is touching because he not only doesn't try to be, he isn't able to be. He's the perfect narrator because he can't narrate in any of the ways we expect a story to be told -- he doesn't understand metaphor, he doesn't understand emotion, he can't put anything into its cultural or social context. So anything that would make a story like this glurgy or heartwarming is impossible. Christopher just tells it exactly the way it is and it's the process that happens in the reader's own mind that creates the reader's emotional response to Christopher. He is the ultimate non-mainpulative storyteller. <br /> <br />The only glurge risk is that readers might try to feel Christopher's emotions FOR him and wind up thereby pitying him (which I think would be brought on by how much this book was hyped as a book about autism or disability, not anything that Haddon actually included in the text). <br /> <br />This story reminds me of the archetype of the Holy Fool -- the one who is mocked and scorned as too simple-minded to understand the complexities of the real world but who, in his simplicity, has a better understanding of the truly important things in life (Forrest Gump is an example of the same archetype, but, of course, it's ultimate glurge). For example, Christopher sees right through the euphemism \\"special needs\\" that's designed to spare his feelings while, ironically, he sees how the other kids can use it as much as an insult as slurs like \\"retard\\". Though I might have found this book more emotionally powerful had such a big deal not been made that Christopher was autistic (which he probably wasn't -- he probably has either Asperger's or a pervasive developmental disorder). It took me awhile to notice that Haddon never defines Christopher as autistic -- this book was billed by the publisher and others as \\"a book about an autistic kid\\". Haddon himself simply presents Christopher as he is and leaves the reader to determine whether Christopher is a \\"normal\\" boy. I was expecting his disability to play a greater role in the story than I think it does or think it should. <br /> <br />I did eventually start skimming some of the rambling. I don't think I lost any interest or caring for either Christopher or the workings of his mind. It may have been that as the story progressed, I became more concerned with the plot and less concerned with the pattern on the train-car seats. Or maybe I just got tired of the details. But the minutae I found so appealing at first did start to wear on me in the second half of the book. <br /> <br />Christopher's father is an equally interesting character. Is he sympathetic or despicable? I could never decide. Some of his actions are so extreme and so horrible -- telling Christopher his mother is dead, killing the dog. Yet he is created in such a way that I truly believed he thought he was doing the best thing for Christopher. Certainly, he was the one best able to parent Christopher on a day-to-day basis. The more I found out about him, the more I wanted to hate him, yet I found I wasn't able to. <br /> <br />On a similar note, this book left me wondering what exactly love is. Christopher is incapable of processing emotion. Does this mean he can't love? Yet he seems to love his mother, father, Siobhan, Toby. He seems to understand that, by taking care of him, Siobhan and his father love him. Yet most of us accept that there is an emotional aspect of love that goes beyond just caring for someone's daily needs. So then what is love? Does Christopher only understand part of it?

068987474X|4.0|As part of the self-help genre, this short book serves its purpose.  It is quick read that reminds women to deal with the reality of their relationship, instead of what they wish it would be. After reading this book and reading the reviews, my conclusion is that the value in this book all depends on the reader's circumstances.  If you are a woman and recognize yourself in some of the examples, then this book can be helpful in showing you when you are beating your head against a brick wall.  Do not try to make a man into something he is not. You are fabulous and you should be treated with respect. If you are a male, and see yourself in the examples, try figuring out why you feel the need to play these games or send mixed signals. <br /> <br />After having been in relationship with a man who is \\"really into me,\\" I now know the difference.  But if you have never had the luck of meeting such a man, you might be very confused about the mixed signals that many men can serve up.  Women are smart enough to read the book and get out of it what they need and want. <br /> <br />On the other hand, I can see why some males would find the book threatening.  It exposes some of their games.  Most males know when they are playing a game; they just won't admit it.  How frightening to them to know some other male has outed them! <br /> <br />To the professor whose review implied that women would now act like princesses, I would say to you, \\"There is nothing in this book that tells women to act like a snotty queen.  It only advises women to love themselves enough to expect to be treated with respect.\\" <br /> <br />Frankly, there are a lot of emotionally handicapped males out there.  To understand more about why this is true in our society, read The Will to Change: Men, Masculinity, and Love by bell hooks.  I would also suggest to women:  There are some very nice, but shy men, out there.  Take a good look at the nice guys who treat you with respect. Treat them with the respect that youwould want for yourself. <br />
B000088E6D|5.0|This cd is amazing. From the first songs \\"Fever\\" and \\"MOOONDANCE\\" to the last song \\"THAT'S ALL\\" this cd showcases the talent of young singer Buble.

B00005JN0T|4.0|Alex Proyas' \\"I, Robot\\" is an exhilarating, entertaining, fast-paced thriller starring the effortlessly charming Will Smith and the beautiful Bridget Moynahan (\\"The Recruit\\", \\"The Sum of All Fears\\").  The story is fairly preposterous, involving, you guessed it, robots and their attempt to take over the world.  And of course Smith's character, Detective Del Spooner, knows that these robots are evil and no one will believe him.  The script is based on Isaac Asimov's book of short stories and co-screenwriter Jeff Vintar's (along with Oscar-winner for \\"A Beautiful Mind\\", Akiva Goldsman) original script, \\"Hardwired\\".<br /><br />In this world of 2035, robots have come to play a vital role in the lives of humans, doing everything from bartending to laundry for their \\"owners\\".  The world is simply teeming with them and their numbers are soon to increase with the largest shipment ever of robots, the NS-5's.  Even though they are programmed to be incapable of injuring humans or committing a crime according to \\"the three laws\\", Detective Spooner is convinced they are up to no good and even tackles a robot he believes to be robbing a woman when he is actually rushing her an inhaler.  The three laws are:<br /><br />1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.<br /><br />2. A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.<br /><br />3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.<br /><br />This is definitely a fun film that I enjoyed immensely.  The whodunit script will keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat right to the end.  If you're willing to suspend reality for a few hours and not think too hard about what you're watching, I think you'll really enjoy \\"I, Robot\\".
0064471837|5.0|Most magic books imitate each other, with the same classic plot. Sabriel is wonderfully different, featuring a young necromancer called Sabriel, whose father, Abhorsen, has been trapped in the realm of Death. Accompanied by a familiar-like animal called Mogget, presently in the form of a cat, and a confused young man whom Mogget calls Touchstone, Sabriel travels in the place called the Old Kingdom, hoping to reunite herself with her father. Pursued by several nasty Dead creatures, Sabriel is exciting, interesting, and believable. This is a fine novel that holds the power to transport you into another world, one that you will want to visit again and again.
B000056K04|5.0|I liked this CD! I am not a traditional Dave Matthews Band follower, so I can't draw on any of their previous work. But I can safely say this CD satisfied me. The creative mix of instruments was easy to listen to and didn't disrupt the flow of the songs. Dave Matthews voice is also a pleasure to listen to. The lyrics were well crafted and cleaver. Give it a listen, it's well worth it.
B00005JNLY|4.0|Here is the story of Cristina Moreno and her relationship with her mother, Flor.  The story (basically) begins when Cristina's father/Flor's husband takes off when she is a young child in Mexico.  Because of their poverty level, Flor and Cristina are forced to flee Mexico in hopes of finding a better life in Southern California.  In time, Flor takes up a job as a nanny or a housekeeper (the job wasn't very specific) for the Clasky family and is thrust upon the inner termoil that is present.    The story is fun to follow and a real emotional roller-coaster.  However, I was blown away by the acting of six of the characters.  There has got to be some Oscar nominations in this movie somewhere for at least three of them.    Flor is played by Paz Vega.  At the beginning of the movie she doesn't speak a word of English, even as she begins her job with the Clasky's.  Flor is very attractive and she has one of the best looks of shock, confusion, anger, and frustration at the events that unfold before her.  It is easy to fall in love with the character of Flor who lives for nobody except her daughter and understands the sacrifices it requires to raise a child.  If everybody raised children with the conviction that Flor had then there wouldn't be a messed up kid anywhere.    John Clasky is played by Adam Sandler.  I am often a Sandler fan, except when he is shooting for laughs by being a complete drunken idiot.  If that is what you like and are expecting in this movie, don't go, you'll be sadly disappointed.  I'm glad he is shying away from that type of role these days, and he most definately doesn't play that role here.  John Clasky is the perfect father and if I had any complaint it was that he was too perfect.  Yes, some foibles were present, but I would have liked to have seen an uglier side of John Clasky to make this movie a bit more real.  However, Sandler still delivers a stand-up job that should be loudly applauded.    Next is Shelbie Bruce, who plays Flor's daughter,Cristina.  As a child actor (I'm guessing 10 years old) she does an incredible job.  Cristina is a child who thinks she knows what is best for herself and is open to the manipulations of Deborah Clasky.  She is often at odds with her mother on doing what is right and is torn apart by the decisions that her mother makes.  There was a scene where Flor, who hasn't learned to speak English, confronts John Clasky and uses Cristina as a translater.  Shelbie Bruce does a wonderful job not only translating the words of her mother, but also her feeling.  It was one of my favorite scenes in the movie.  Shelbie Bruce even does a great job at the end of the movie when she finally confronts Flor because of the decisions Flor has made for her.    And on to my three favorite characters.    The first is Tea Leoni who plays Deborah Clasky.  I've always liked Tea Leoni as she usually shines in every movie she is in.  However, this is the first movie where she really lets herself go, in my opinion (granted, I haven't seen most of her movies).  There are scenes where she plays her stunningly beautiful self but then there are scenes where she goes the complete opposite direction.  She gets so bad in one scene that her mother (played by Cloris Leachman, she is next) comments that she needs a fire hose to clean herself up.  It is nice to see somebody like her allow herself to get so undone in a movie.  She can play emotion very well and she doesn't fail here as she plays every emotion I've ever felt in my life.    The second is Cloris Leachman, who plays Deborah Clasky's mother.  Every scene with her in it just shines, and most of them just made me laugh out loud.  She most definately has the best and funniest lines of the movie.  However, Cloris' performance is dead on in every scene of the movie as, she too, must go through most of the emotional spectrum.    And finally, the older Clasky child is Bernice, who is played by Sarah Steele.  Bernice is looking for some affection from her parents, especially  her mother.  You see some of the few moments of excitement in her eyes when she thinks she is being treated by her mother, and you totally identify with her during her disappointments.  Again, she also has a dead-on performance with every scene she is in and forces you to emphasize with the problems her character has.    The story has a great message, which is that there is no greater sacrifice than those for your children and often through your children.  Some of the lines and the logic seemed a bit off, but the ending leaves you satisfied that you got your money's worth in a movie.  I especially love the highlighted differences between the American and Latino cultures.  I would recommend this movie for those who really enjoy a great performance on the screen.
B00005JN0T|4.0|In the future people will have robots helping them with their daily lives, and these robots have three laws that they have to obey in order to keep mankind safe.<br /><br />1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.<br /><br />2. A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.<br /><br />3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.<br /><br />Robots fetch things when needed, they do the hard work at home such as cooking the meals and cleaning the homes.  Who would not like to have a robot, which would do the laundry and shopping while the owner could go about doing what they enjoy the most?  The freed up time would hopefully also lead to people searching for a greater meaning in their existence as they hopefully would not become more sedentary and cerebrally lazy.<br /><br />There is one person, homicide detective Del Spooner (Will Smith), who wants nothing from robots as he takes pleasure in retro clothing as he wears throwback Converse Chuck Taylor All-Stars and loves to turn up his stereo's volume loud, by himself, with a remote control.  Spooner's dislike for robots seems to stem from a recurring nightmare where a robot smashes in the car window and leads to him waking up drenched in sweat.  His dislike for robots borders prejudice as he wishes nothing from them as he only sees them as a threat to humanity.<br /><br />At work Spooner's coworkers make fun of him and his distrust of robots as everyone is fully aware of the three laws of robotics.  Robots simply do not harm people as they never have or will.  However, the rules of robotics seems to have been broken when Spooner receives a personal phone call in regards to a suicide of the engineering genius, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell).  There is one robot, Sunny (Alan Tudyk), who displays feelings such as anger and confusion.  Sonny even admits that he has dreams, and he could even have been capable of murdering Dr. Lanning.<br /><br />The investigation of Dr. Lanning's proclaimed suicide leads Spooner into a mesh of conspiracy theories as someone seems to be plotting to kill him as well.  Spooner realizes that he cannot do it all himself as he seeks help from an employee, Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan), of the U.S. Robotics who is specialized in psychology as she tries to make the robots more human like.  Together Spooner and Calvin set out to find out who is behind the so called suicide, but they seem to have stumbled upon something much bigger than they expected.<br /><br />I, Robot is based on Isaac Asimov's stories where the robot-psychologist Susan Calvin is the main character in most of the stories.  The film is loosely adapted from the stories, unfortunately film does not deliver the same level of complexity as the stories.  The film should have given Asimov more credit than what it did as Asimov was not just a writer, but also a futuristic philosopher who created the three laws of robotics as he was tired of reading about evil robots.  Nonetheless, the film addresses several interesting notions such as Descartes' \\"I think, Therefore I am\\", the philosophical and psychological aspect of consciousness, and evolutionary philosophy.<br /><br />Alex Proyas has previously displayed his cunning skills in creating a haunting futuristic atmosphere in Dark City (1998), which is a brilliant cinematic experience.  In I, Robot Proyas brings current Chicago into a futuristic landscape where the audience still can see the Sears Tower and the Hancock Building.  However, the tallest building in the film belongs to U.S. Robotics, which is located somewhere between the two older skyscrapers.  The Chicago touch brings the film closer to the audience as the can identify with the story, especially if you live in the Chicago.  For example, the West Loop area seems to have gone through a great change, which is currently underway as well.<br /><br />I, Robot is a breathtaking action adventure placed in the future where deep conspiracies brew underneath the surface.  The story line interchanges between dangerous stunts, cool CGI effects, entertaining one-liners, and lethal car chases while being subjected to a science fictionalized philosophy.  However, the notions presented in the film have already been presented through HAL 9000 (2001: A Space Odyssey), Ash (Alien), and Red Queen (Resident Evil) to name a few.  Regrettably, the use of similar themes hurts the overall cinematic experience, and if the film had remained true to Asimow it might have been a brilliant film.  Nonetheless, I, Robot offers a truly excellent cinematic experience, which offers a little for everyone.e gone through a great change, which is currently underway as well. <br /> <br />I, Robot is a breathtaking action adventure placed in the future where deep conspiracies brew underneath the surface.

B000002UAX|4.0|This is a very self-indulgent album.  Martin wanted one good disc but no one was willing to sacrifice anything.  The result is Wild Honey Pie, Piggies, Sexy Sadie, Revolution 9 and other excesses.  My recommendation is buy the album and make a CDR of stuff that isn't crap--Back in the USSR, Happiness is a Warm Gun and whatever else tickles you.  Then add Hey Jude and Revolution, the single recorded in the middle of the White album sessions.  Then you have a Beatle album that measures with Revolver, Sgt Pepper, and Abbey Road.
B00005JNBQ|3.0|The director Jared Hess brings the viewers a minimalistic comedy about a complete loser, Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder), with no self-esteem, skills, or friends.  The film is on occasion offensively straightforward as it pokes directly on Napoleon through the way he dresses, behaves, and how people around him act toward him.  Several geek films has been made in the past such as Revenge of the Nerds (1984), Rushmore (1998), and American Pie (1999), but Napoleon Dynamite delivers a film unique in the sense that it is directly making fun of the nerd.  This is, on occasion, hilarious as the things that Napoleon does seem awkward and embarrassing, yet there is a finer touch of compassion for him as he struggles with his daily endeavors.  In a sense it becomes much like a clown show at a circus.  It is funny, but at the expense of the main character.<br /><br />The film displays a number of episodic events that comprise a cinematic montage of Napoleon's lifestyle.  Through the montage the audience learns that Napoleon lives with his grandmother and his older brother, that is a nerd much like himself.  The mise-en-scene and the script also lays out the groundwork for why Napoleon is a nerd, as nobody really offers him help with anything.  This tall gangly high school kid that constantly has his mouth open while he peaks through his glasses like a mole attempts to separate the shadows in order to distinguish what is in front of him.  It is impossible not to feel sorry for him while laughing at his idiosyncrasies.<br /><br />The audience is presented with how he becomes friends with Pedro (Efren Ramirez), a new student in his school, and with Deb (Tina Majorino).  Through their minute help Napoleon finds an insignificant amount of courage as it provides him with enough hope to begin regaining some of his lost self-esteem.  The quest for something better also has it's difficulties as Napoleon must deal with his scheming uncle Rico, who brings his older brother into his schemes, as they also offend him in public.  The struggle that Napoleon is fighting is for his own place in society as he wants something better, yet his awkwardness within society makes it difficult for him to adjust.  Besides Napoleon's struggle there are several amusing situations such as when he must feed his grandmother's lama and the drawing he sends to a girl he wants to ask out to an upcoming school dance.<br /><br />The opening credits seem to have been influenced by Dogma 95 as it uses food and pictures in order to introduce the cast and crew of the film.  Nonetheless, it is a fun and clever beginning that sets the tone for the rest of the film.  The camera work and story bear some similarities with Rushmore (1998) and Royal Tenenbaums (2001) by Wes Anderson, but it does not copy these films as it remains unique.  The story is fragmented in chronological order and Napoleon leaves a lasting imprint with the audience.  Yet, the story itself does not seem to leave much of anything for the audience to ponder, but maybe the film will give some extra laughs with friends thanks to Jon Heder's character in the film.emes, as they also offend him in public.

0767834739|3.0|I had heard a lot about Resident Evil - Apocalyse before I had a chance to see the movie. Most of the folks I spoke to fell into one or two categories. They either loved the movie or hated it. I, on the other hand, had more ambivalent feelings. IMHO the first movie was much better. Though, Apocalypse does have some redeeming qualities...mainly the dead dogs are back in action. There is nothing better then zombie canines.<br /><br />The movie picks up where the last left off. T-virus has spread and chaos reigns all over Raccoon City. The evil Umbrella Corporation is doing all it can to contain the virus, but it's spreading faster then anyone could imagine. In an effort to study the disease, and keep it from spreading, the corporation has sealed off the city. It's then that the real action begins.<br /><br />Resident Evil is full of action. There a lot of things blowing up, bullets flying, and plenty of people dying and re-animating. Not to mention, there is a huge terminator-esque bio-weapon running around.<br /><br />I didn't find the movie too trying. But, overall the entire venture was short on plot. Events, people and circumstances were left virtually unexplained. Most of the acting was sub-par and just when you think the movie is over it starts off with another crazy hypothesis. It's like the neverening story...and I mean this truly.<br /><br />I wish I could give this movie more then three stars, but it just doesn't deserve it. Though, the soundtrack is again superb Milla J. returns as Alice. That in it of itself is worth something.
B000002H33|5.0|This album is always compared to Metallica's previous album, \\"Ride Lightning,\\" and for good reason. It is possible to compare each track on this album with the corresponding track number on \\"Ride The Lightning.\\" While this may sound bad, it really is only a small fault to an otherwise great album. <br />1. Battery 10/10- Is so great it actually surpasses the excellent \\"Fight Fire with Fire\\" from the previous album. Starts out with a classic guitar intro that leads into a thrash/speed metal fury by Hetfield. Great lightning-fast riffs and an excellent solo by Hammett. A masterpiece of its genre. <br />2. Master of Puppets 10/10- While fans of new Metallica will say \\"Enter Sandman\\" is Metallica's defining moment, true fans will argue that this song is their most memorable. Great riffs and solos by both Hammett and Hetfield. Even with all this, it still is not as good as \\"Ride the Lightning,\\" but don't get me wrong, this is still one of Metallica's best songs ever. <br />3. The Thing that Should not Be 6/10- At first I hated it, but now it has grown on me somewhat. Catchy verses, but nowhere near as good as \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls.\\" <br />4. Welcome Home (Sanitarium) 10/10- This is the ballad song on the disc, but it is in no way cheesy like the hair metal power ballads that were popular at the time. This is a masterpiece about a man in an insane asylum. Boasts a quieter beginning, which fades away to a thrashy ending with a couple of good guitar solos. Not quite as good as \\"Fade to Black\\" but still a defining moment in Metallica's career. <br />5. Disposable Heros 9/10- Holy crap, James Hetfield is talented! He spits out eight minutes of several different amazing lightning-fast riffs. This song is about a young man who is being commanded to fight in a no-win situation in a war. It drags at the end and goes on for just a little bit too long, which is what keeps this from being better than \\"Trapped Under Ice.\\" <br />6. Leper Messiah 7/10- Many fans consider this filler, but for filler this is pretty [darn] good. I hate it when bands include the count (1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3...) before the start of the song, but that is just a small complaint. Has a great memorable riff. Just slightly lower than \\"Escape.\\" <br />7. Orion 9/10- You can hear Cliff Burton's influence on the melody of this instrumental. Riff lovers with never get tired of this song, which is broken up into two parts. As far as instrumentals go, this one is really good. It probably ties \\"Call of Ktulu\\" for best instrumental of Metallica's career. <br />8. Damage, Inc. 6/10- Another thrash/speed metal song to end the album, is pretty good, but nowhere near as good as \\"Battery.\\" Has a great solo. This song cannot be compared to any from \\"Ride the Lightning,\\" but is a good ending song. <br /> <br />As was the case for \\"Ride the Lightning,\\" the lyrics here are as much of a art as the music itself. This time all of the songs deal with powerlessness and weakness. The album's only true fault lies with the production. Actually, the production is Metallica's best until the Black Album, but the production makes Hammett's solos buzz thinly, and while this isn't noticeable on all songs, it makes them nowhere near as good as the pure sound that he had on \\"Ride The Lightning.\\" That being said, this album is a must-own for any metal fan, especially one who is looking for something better than most of the crap that is being spit out by bands today. Even with all the hype, the album truly lives up all of the good things said about it.
B0002I831S|5.0|If you're considering purchasing this DVD set, then I'm assuming you're familiar with the show (or purchasing it for someone who is), so I won't bother critiquing the content.<br /><br />i've been having a ball with this DVD set.  it's superb.  it's a great collection, complete with the episode \\"trailers\\" and the whole ball of wax.  it's like a time capsule from the 60s.  for fans of the original series, I can't recommend it highly enough.<br /><br />The greatest complaints about this set seem to concern:  the packaging; the lack of voluminous amounts of commentary; and the fact that the picture doesn't look pristine; that the episodes are sorted by airdate, not stardate; the price.  My opinions, to whit:<br /><br />(1) packaging:  my greatest reluctance about purchasing this box set concerned the packaging:  i have a tight little shelf for my DVD collection, and a big dopey plastic lunchbox probably wouldn't fit.  i was delighted to see that the lunchbox has the same aspect ratio as a regular-sized DVD case, although it is slightly thicker.  yes, the book of discs that fits inside the lunchbox is tape-bound, but i'm not tuned off by that, and the quality seems reasonable.  sure, i'd probably prefer a regular cardboard slipcase for this set, but i think the packaging is only silly, not completely stupid; besides, you're paying for what's on the discs, so you'd be a snob to let the packaging completely turn you off.<br /><br />(2) commentaries:  personally, i think commentary and extra-special gee-whiz features are overrated, so i'm the wrong person to voice up on this.  the pop-up text commentary is amusing/interesting, but on occasion, factually wrong.  i haven't seen any of the extra featurettes.  personally, i'm happy there isn't any voice commentary, as the cost of producing them would drive up the price of the set, and i'm starved enough for time to just watch the episodes by themselves.<br /><br />(3) pristine picture:  give me a break.  this was made for television almost forty years ago.  i'm watching this on a 42\\" PDP and i think it looks fabulous.  yes, some of the effects shots are grainy (because of they fact that they had to be re-photographed so many times, such were the special effects of the 60s), and sure they could be cleaned up with many many *many* hours of laborious digital wizardry, but (1) guess who's going to end up paying for that?  you guessed it:  the consumer.  (2) i'll repeat myself:  these special effects are from the 60s.  would hours of digital wizardry *really* be worth it?  personally, i'm revelling in the program's vintage and enjoy watching it in its original glory.  once you start restoring things, you run the danger of crossing the line and becoming a wingnut like George Lucas and bastardizing the original product.<br /><br />(4) airdate vs. stardate order:  you'll either want it one way or the other, and if it's not published to your taste, then just watch the episodes in a different order.  big deal.  personally i think watching the episodes in airdate order is much more interesting.  i'm watching these episodes for the first time in over a decade, so it's almost like watching the series all over again from scratch.  and by watching them in airdate order, i can expose myself to the same chronology as the original viewers, which shapes the universe, character development, etc.  yeah, there's some discontinuity, but i would be surprised if people noticed it much back then.  each order gives you a slightly different perception of the characters, their dynamic, and the Star Trek universe; i find the order in which the series was originally presented to be the most interesting, but that's just me.<br /><br />(5) The price:  let's do the math:  29 episodes, 50 minutes apiece.  that's 24+ hours total; about 16 full-length movies worth of content, and i'm not counting the commentary or the trailers.  if the average movie costs $13, this comes out at twice the value.<br /><br />to summarize, i was reluctant to shell out the big money for this set for many reasons, but i'm exceedingly happy that i did.asons, but i'm exceedingly happy that i did.
B000679N96|5.0|To think my life may end and I would NEVER hear this home recording of '10:15 Saturday Night' almost scares me.  The entire bonus disc, while at times a bit \\"bootleged\\" sounding (particularly the live tracks from Nottingham [it WAS 1979 remember!]) will satisfy any fan of the already heralded original album. <br /> <br />Comebacks are a bitch when you have to try to out-do what has come to be one of the greatest albums of all-time - 'Three Imaginary Boys'.
B000268QB2|4.0|I first heard \\"Somewhere only we know\\" on the radio and was wondering if Jeff Lynne of ELO had made a comeback. The DJ said the rest of the cd was equally good. I Listening to the rest of the cd, I found myelf comparing it to Ben Folds Five arrangements and AHA vocal ranges on \\"This is the last time\\".  \\"We might as well be strangers\\" is a haunting song which echoed some feelings I once had. Overall a very relaxing cd and if you like Stephen Bishop you will be pleased...
B0000AK7AG|4.0|Okay, so maybe the \\"talking animals\\" thing isn't realistic, and the \\"pig herding sheep\\" thing isn't, either.  But the story is so cute and entertaining!  I felt so sorry for Babe in the beginning, and almost as proud as the farmer when Babe would do something good such as herding the sheep.  I also liked how each part of the movie had a title telling you what to expect.  And the singing mice...oh, they were so cute and funny!  I wish they would have shown more close-ups of them! <br /> <br />Overall, though not worthy of an Academy Award, this is a great movie!  It was much better then I expected.  Some parts might disturb very small children, but other then that I think that this is a great family movie!  Babe is a very likable main character and his friends are enjoable and occasionally funny.  But under the sweet covering is the moral that the director wants for you to walk away with...how would you like to be slaughtered for food?  But though this may affect some, I am sad to say that I am still eating bacon and pork.  Anyway, this is a good movie that children and grown-ups alike will enjoy.
B0000A118M|5.0|Coltrane's \\"A Love Supreme\\" is advanced music.  Far beyond the relatively simple \\"melody-solo-melody\\" structure of almost all other jazz pieces, Trane's album flows, and tells its message in its own way.  Buy this album, and before doing anything else, before even reading the liner notes, listen to the entire thing all the way through.  Listen to what he's saying.
0765309408|5.0|I went back and forth between four stars and five.  On the one hand, this novel is not great literature on the level of say, \\"Dune\\" by Frank Herbert.  On the other hand, \\"Old Man's War\\" is a terrific read, very imaginative, and not terribly implausible.<br /><br />No spoilers here, so my discussion of the story will be limited.  The essential premise and storyline is that in the near future, Earth/humankind have discovered the \\"skip drive\\" which is a method of interstellar space travel.  Mankind quickly learns that valuable planets are a scarce commodity and there are several intelligent races in our neck of the Galaxy that as a matter of routine try to use military force to take planets away from other races.  Including, of course, human colonial planets.  Accordingly, to protect Earth and also to protect colony worlds, the \\"Colonial Defense Force\\" enlists elderly human beings on Earth as soldiers to protect the colony worlds.  The protagonist in the novel is such a one.<br /><br />The novel includes pretty strong character development.  It manages to make some of the characters both lifelike and alien.  This is no small feat and a task that most science fiction authors struggle with.  Here, the author succeeds.<br /><br />The author's speculations about what interaction between mankind and aliens will be like are startling.  The reader can decide for him or her self whether they are plausible.  I was not able to say that they were implausible, at any rate.<br /><br />The novel contains dazzling speculation about the future destiny of humanity in space and technology in general.  This, combined with a fast-moving storyline and solid plot, earns this one five stars in my opinion.  Quite frankly, this is far and away the best science fiction novel that I have read since \\"Dune\\" and \\"The Forever War\\" and it gives my old favorite \\"The Forever War\\" a run for its money in terms of which is my favorite military science fiction novel of all time.  Any lover of \\"hard\\" science fiction will want to snap this one up, and I imagine \\"Old Man's War\\" is destined for Hugo and Nebula awards.rd\\" science fiction will want to snap this one up, and I imagine \\"Old Man's War\\" is destined for Hugo and Nebula awards.
B00003CXB6|3.0|\\"The Lost World: Jurassic Park\\" isn't as creative or as good as the first movie, but still has enough good things to make it an entertaining sequel. The visual effects are very impressive, most of the creatures seem genuine dinosaurs, and the CGI T-Rex is improved this time, it has more movements and seems more realistic. <br /> <br />There are a lot of exciting scenes, with great stunts and thrilling action, but there are a couple of weaknesses: the cast and the director seemed to go on automatic pilot, the performances are not as solid as in the first movie. The second weakness is the script, it recycles most of the strongest points of the original movie, so the movie starts to loose some steam when it becomes more repetitive. <br /> <br />So the question is: \\"The Lost World: Jurassic Park\\" is a bad movie? Not at all. It's a very decent sequel that provides entertainment and a good share of thrills, it could have been better, but it's a good movie. This is the kind of entertainment that only Hollywood can do.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Easily the latest cult classic. <br /> <br />I must admit, when I first heard of this movie I had no idea it even existed! Upon  <br />watching the trailer on television some few days later, I was literally in stitches on the floor. Just the look of Napoleon's face (\\"You better watch it; it's the greatest movie ever\\" or something like that) was enough to send me into hysterical laughter. <br /> <br />It's plotless; completly pointless, I am totally admitting. But the way it revolves around Napoleon's strange and twisted life, from his stay-at-home, Internet-obsessed older brother to his out-and-about grandmother and his living-in-the-past uncle (1982? Need I say more?), I found myself not looking for a plot. Simply observing the way they lived and engaged with other people was so hysterical I didn't even think of a plot (save for Pedro's race against Summer). <br /> <br />Napoleon Dynamite is confusing. It has a kind of dry humor that I haven't really seen in many other kinds of films. Personally, Napoleon wasn't the easiest character to love; he often barked at family members and randomly expected people to do orders for him (which is later explained in the DVD commentary), but in the end I found myself rooting for Napoleon as he won over his school during Pedro's skit.  <br /> <br />Before I end, I'd like to personally address reviewer Donna who totally criticised the movie over the Mexican \\"racism.\\" I am Mexican and found absolutely nothing offensive. It appears to me that you don't watch absolutely any TV since that is how most Mexicans are portrayed and while I don't act like that at all, I do know many who do just like in the movie(s). This movie isn't trying to make a point. It's just trying to be funny; it's not trying to piss anybody off. <br /> <br />I highly recommened this film. While some may not immediately understand the film's rather dry sense of humor, those who do take part in it will eventually see it and find themselves laughing all the way.
B00005O5CM|3.0|\\"Legally Blonde\\" is an amusing movie, with a very charismatic central character, Elle Woods (played by Reese Witherspoon), a beautiful blonde girl who seems to know very little about everything, except shopping and designer clothes. Reese carries the weight of this film over her shoulders, and she is the main reason why \\"Legally Blonde\\" works fine.  <br />  <br /> The plot is not complex, but it's charming and amusing. The characters are kinda standard (Elle Woods being the exception): you got the pretty boy who pretends to be more than he actually is, you got the mean girl that hates the good girl, but eventually they become good friends, you got the ugly guy with good heart and big brain, you got the good guy that wins the heart of the good girl, and so on. But this movie works because even though the characters aren't exactly original, the situations, some jokes and the charisma of the cast are notable. <br />  <br /> Obviously, the main reason to see \\"Legally Blonde\\" is Reese Witherspoon, her performance is charming, and that translates into a lovable character...oh, by the way, Reese Witherspoon looks stunning in this movie. \\"Legally Blonde\\" is the kind of movie that can be amusing for both men and women.
B0002YLC24|4.0|I did not see the first movie but this one is good and you can watch them out of order.  The acting was superb and the plot was realistic. The only reason why I gave it four stars is because Ethan looks terrible than he did nine years ago. What happened? Must be drugs or something.
B0000A02TZ|3.0|\\"Animal House\\" was the movie that started the trend of college comedies, and by the way, it's much better than imitators like \\"Porky's\\" or more recently the \\"American Pie\\" trilogy. If you have seen many films from the 80s, you will find a lot of familiar faces in this movie, but the only one that started a promising career was John Belushi, unfortunately he died a few years later. Kevin Bacon appears briefly, but he is not one of the main characters. <br /> <br />In \\"Animal House\\" you will see most of the stuff that has been shamelessly imitated throughout the years: there are pretty girls (specially Karen Allen), jokes directed to the authority figures, silly (but funny) humor, a lot of irreverent characters, and yes, the toga scene. <br /> <br />\\"Animal House\\" is a simple, basic comedy, but it's funny and it's better than all those copycat movies that came out in the 80s and 90s.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|I never get tired of watching this movie.  it truly is a beautiful love story.  Anyone who is romantic and enjoys a little humor would definitely enjoy this movie.
6305095442|3.0|\\"Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn\\" is one of the most influential horror sequels of all time. This movie changed the tone of the first movie and became a spoof movie. \\"Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn\\" mocks virtually of every cliche of the horror genre. Since this movie gain cult following, other franchises have copied its humorous style, horror franchises like \\"Child's Play\\", \\"A Nightmare On Elm Street\\" and \\"Friday The 13th\\" have shamelessly ripped-off \\"Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn\\", just check out \\"Bride Of Chucky\\" or \\"Freddy Vs. Jason\\". <br /> <br />Also recent movies like \\"Idle Hands\\" are inspired by the \\"Evil Dead\\" series. Obviously, none of those movies is as satisfying as \\"Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn\\". The best thing in this movie is the camera work, the camera angles and the editing are so frantic and dynamic that you feel like you are flying in the enchanted woods of the movie. The possessed creatures move as fast as a feline, and are as aggressive as a grizzly bear, and that's really impressive, because these are not your typical flaccid, slow, fragile creatures that usually appear in horror movies. <br /> <br />The director Sam Raimi has gained a cult following with the \\"Evil Dead\\" series, and now that he became a mainstream director with the \\"Spider-Man\\" movies, he has adapted some of his best tricks to those films, check out the camera angles of \\"Spider-Man\\" 1 & 2, also the editing is very fast like the kind of editing that he used in \\"Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn\\".
B00000IL26|5.0|I am going to throw my two cents in and agree with a previous reviewer that the Van Gelder edition took a serious step backwards in sound quality from the original vinyl and first edition of the CD.  I really can't fathom why this is being sold as a \\"remastered\\" edition.  I have what I consider to be a nice HiFi system, and I love the sound on the original CD that I have.   <br />On to the music:  Lee Morgan falls somewhere between Miles and Freddy in that he is obviously a lot more prodigal in terms of his outright ability to play the trumpet.  He plays like it's an extension of his person.  Not many musicians ever reach the level where it is as natural to play their instrument as it is to speak, walk, sing, or think.  Lee has definitely done that.  He's not afraid to go out on a limb when he takes a walk, and it pays off.  Wow, anyone who loves trumpet really should give this a listen.  I loved his performance on Blue Train (Coltrane), and this is the logical progression.  He has expanded his range, chops, comfort level, and he's starting to compose some nice tunes.  My favorite tracks are the two takes of \\"Totem Pole\\".  I have made serious jazz fans of several friends over the years with that one song.  It's just so accessible, catchy, and what a rythm section.
B00005JKLZ|3.0|First there was H.G. Wells' classic novel. Then there was the classic film of 1960 by George Pal. Since the 2002 version of \\"The Time Machine\\" is based on these two works (much more on Pal then on Herbert George), some comparision between them is unavoidable. <br /> <br />The first 20 minutes of the new \\"Time Machine\\" are its best. Ironically, this is the only portion of the film which isn't based on either Pal or H.G. Wells... Instead, it gives us a completely new and original background story for the time traveller: In this film, it is a personal tragedy which compells the hero to build a time machine and try to change the past.  <br /> <br />After the time traveller (named \\"Alexander\\" in this film) fails to manipulate his personal past, he embarks on a journey into the future to search for the reason he failed. Once he touches that lever which sends the machine to the future, the film follows the same plot as the 1960 version of \\"The Time Machine\\". This point, about 25 minutes into the film, marks the end of \\"The Time Machine 2002 - a decent sci-fi film\\" and the beginning of \\"The Time Machine 2002 - the lame remake\\". <br /> <br />Why lame? Because the \\"remake\\" portion of the film is far worse then original 1960 version in almost every aspect. There are a few exceptions which are noted below: <br /> <br />1. The time machine itself. As much as the original 1960 machine was neat, it really can't compare with the incredible design work Dreamworks did for the 2002 version: The new time machine is an absolute beauty. <br /> <br />2. Orlando Jones as the Digital Librarian in the future, Vox. He provides both a comic relief and a couple of touching scenes near the end of the film. <br /> <br />3. The time travel sequences. The amazing computer graphics compensate here for the lack of personal touch (Although the original 1960 version does retain its own charm). <br /> <br />These good points take, perhaps, 10 minutes of the film. The love story and tragedy in the beginning takes another 20 minutes... 30 decent minutes out of a 96-minute movie. And the ending of the film sucks too (I won't give it away, but it DOES suck big time). <br /> <br />All-in-all, this film is a disappointment. It certainly is an entertaining way to spend 96 minutes, but that's all it is. Wells fans are still waiting for a decent modern version of Herbert George's time travel tale.
B00000JLWW|5.0|Having not watched the Titanic DVD in a long while watched it again on New Years Eve sparked by seeing DiCaprio's terrific performance in the \\"Aviator\\". As a high grade romance novel the movie really works coupled with terrific sets & special effects that still hold up in 2005. I don't feel the movie is too long, in fact its length is what gave Cameron a chance play out full character development & plot. You don't win 11 Oscars & set worldwide box office records if your products stinks.
0440178002|5.0|KONNICHIWA! <br /> I got Shogun for my birthday, and it is awesome. I had not been that interested in Japanese culture, and what I usually assosciated Japan with was what I saw from martial arts movies, etc. BUT, this book was awesome. It grabbed my attention, which is what I most liked about it. Even if you are not interested in Japanese culture, this book will make you interested! It is the epic story of an english pilot who is shipwrecked and lands in Japan. The book follows his life in Japan, how he is intergrated into their society, etc. On the way, loads of Japanese culture is revealed to you. There is action, intrigue, everything you would ever want, as well as occasional humour. <br />The characters are all different and unforgettable. I seriously recommend this book to anyone. You will not be displeased!
0767834739|3.0|With twice the budget, this movie is only half as good as the original Resident Evil.<br /><br />The problem ?<br /><br />Resident Evil like most \\"Zombie\\"-related films get their appeal from the feeling of dread derived by being pursued relentlessly by massive hordes of living dead.<br /><br />In Resident Evil: Apocalypse we get about 8 minutes of zombies at the beginning and 2 minutes at the end.<br /><br />The rest of the movie revolves around our band of heroes fighting the Umbrella Corp. Security Team.<br /><br />Call it \\"Matrix Meets Resident Evil\\".<br /><br />Not as entertaining as the first by any means.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I've watched GG for all 5 season, 5 wonderful years of watching Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel's chemistry as mother and daughter. Their wit is amazing and the writing of this show is amazing all the same. Road Trip To Harvard is by far my favorite S2 eppy. Everyone buy this dvd set, start collecting, and I can't wait to get season 3 when it comes out...
B0002Y69LI|5.0|I almost didn't watch this film because it said Quentin Tarentino Presents, and I thought that meant &quot;lots of gore,&quot; and I'm just not interested in gory stories. But this film was made without QT's input - he lent his name to help publicize Hero, a Chinese-made epic film. And although there are lots of martial arts sword fights, everything is -- don't be scared off by this -- poetically portrayed with simple dialog and deep feeling. Despite all the fighting, there aren't a lot of huge blood spurts and cruel closeups, but there is a memorable love story and a great historical perspective. The violence exists to serve a point -- revealed late in the film. There are some scenes in this movie that will stay with me forever, such as the battles above a still lake and in a forest of yellow leaves. The film, like the also gorgeous Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, deserves all the publicity it can get.
B00062FLG0|5.0|When this album was released in 1985 by Camel, it left me breathless. The album is truly a masterpiece. In this remastered edition we have a chance to loisten to the epic song \\"Pressue Points\\" in its full length (Previously released live on \\"Pressure Points Live\\" in 1985) and all its glory. As a taster for old Camel fans we also have a chance to listen to the previously unreleased song (Originally released in 1985 Pressure Points Concert film) \\"In The Arms of the Waltzing Frauleins\\". The rest of this concept album focuses on the political, emotional and loneliness themes. \\"Stationary Traveller\\", \\"Vopos\\", \\"Long Goodbyes\\" and \\"West Berlin\\" are other highlights. Andrew Latimer's playing and songwriting has never been this much emotional and effective. I believe this album is the best album I have heard during 80's and I really miss the live version of \\"Stationary Traveller\\" here. All in all I strongly suggest to any fan of Progressive rock to buy this CD.
B0006399FS|5.0|Never thought they'd match Joshua Tree, but they've done it. Plenty of pop hooks and hummable phrases to be sure, but The Edge provides acid guitar riffs to perfectly complement Bono's by turns agonized and joyful vocals. While they've come close here and there over the years since Joshua Tree, no one album is this tight, this unified, top to bottom, side to side. This must be due to Steve Lillywhite's production efforts - there's not a clinker in the bunch.<br /><br />When you don't want to hit the forward button to skip even one song on the disc, that's unusual. Atomic Bomb has a rightful place among those truly great albums that deliver the pure pleasure that rock music can provide.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|This is a charming film that offers laughs and tears. The characters are easy to sympathize with and offer some outrageous situations which should be expected in a film about tall tales. But this story is gentle and really about a son learning to love his father and appreciate him.  <br /> <br />This film has a PG-13 rating but perhaps deserves a 'G' (even though that is often considered an audience killer). The two reasons my wife and I saw for the PG-13 rating are: <br />1) A couple shots of nudity (although not erotic more like looking at art) <br />2) A scene where a vehicle is 'rocking' - mildly suggestive at worst. <br />I wouldn't hesitate to let my young children watch this movie if I thought they would find it interesting. <br /> <br />Despite all that I said above - this is not what I would call a 'chick flick', guys should enjoy this film equally.
B00000APLB|4.0|If you went to a bar, paid an $8 cover to hear a band, and they sounded like the Stones do on Love You Live - slurred vocals, botching a lyric here or there, sometimes indifferent musicianship - you'd probably want your money back, or at least not go see them again.  But this is THE ROLLING STONES!!!!  So people fall all over themselves to praise this recording of the Stones not exactly at their very best.  That's why I allude to The Emperor's New Clothes in the title of the review. <br /> <br />But you know what?  This album rocks and is a lot of fun!  That's why I like it! <br /> <br />There's plenty of good stuff here:  The \\"Fanfare for the Common Man\\" and spoken introduction in French.  \\"If You Can't Rock Me\\" live is excellent, and the excitement builds as it bridges over into \\"Get Off of My Cloud.\\"  Keith rips the cover off \\"Happy.\\"  Live \\"Star Star\\" is a must for any Stones fan's collection.  The four El Mocambo oldies that open Disk 2 are great (they were recorded in an intimate setting in Toronto, and the band interacts with each other and with the crowd far better than on the rest of Love You Live).  Best of all though are the last four songs.  The Stones start with an awesome version of \\"It's Only Rock 'N Roll\\" - not one of my favorite Stones songs either - then bring it up 50 notches at a time as they move into \\"Brown Sugar\\" and then \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash.\\"  The concluding song, \\"Sympathy For the Devil,\\" is notably different from the studio version or the one on Get Yer Ya-Yas Out but you'll come to love it as it extends out to the finish. <br /> <br />Most of the songs not mentioned above are done indifferently.  \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" is dragged WAAAAAYYYY out and even includes an audience singalong - a bit self-indulgent by the Stones.  And as already mentioned in this and other reviews, the Stones of 1976 and 1977, when this was recorded, were much, much more into substance abuse and living the high life as rockers than they were into putting on excellent presentations of their music.  This is the most underachieving of their live releases.  If that bothers you, skip Love You Live. <br /> <br />But if you enjoy the Stones, and want to hear what they sounded like at this period in their lives - they sobered up by the late 70s and all of their tours since that time have been almost machinelike in their precision - get Love You Live.  The Stones at their worst play circles around most other bands at their best.

0440241413|5.0|Confessions of a shopaholic is a such a fun read because it made me laugh so many times throughout the book.  Once I started reading I seriously couldn't find myself stopping.  I constantly wanted to find out what crazy thing Rebecca Bloomwood would do next.  In this book, I am able to relate to her in so many ways, thus found an interesting connection with her.  I can't wait to get started on Shopaholic takes Manhattan!
0375703861|3.0|Having just finished the book, I can't see what all the fuss was about.  If Amazon allowed it, I'd give the book 31/2 stars.  However, the huge advance, the Booker Prize, and the avalanche of critical praise were hyperbole.  Other reviewers have detailed the plot, so no need to sum up here.  The strengths of the book are vivid, colorful characters, an involving plot, a real sense of place, and original writing and language.  Though there are no real weaknesses of the book, there's no heft to it either.  To me, it read like a grade A comic soap opera and nothing more.
0786869143|2.0|+++++<br /><br />The concept of luck or a lucky person is best illustrated with an example.  Consider a person who schedules a plane trip.  He/she, however, decides at the last minute because of family commitments not to go on the plane trip.  A few hours later that person hears on the news that the plane he/she was to go on crashed and all people on board were killed.  Now that's what I call a lucky person.<br /><br />The author, psychologist Richard Wiseman, defines lucky people as those \\"for whom seemingly chance events tend to work out consistently in their favor.\\"<br /><br />Thus, I was excited when I read this book's back cover that stated that Wiseman had discovered \\"four scientific principles of luck.\\"  Scientific principles are derived from scientific experiments.  (Setting up scientific experiments to measure luck would have to be ingenious.)  One of the cornerstones of scientific experiments is that they are objective (meaning to involve no thoughts and feelings).<br /><br />Sadly and surprisingly (considering Wiseman's credentials) after I read this book, I found that at no point in this book are there any objective tests (that is, scientific experiments) to measure luck.  Instead, the people he uses classify themselves as \\"lucky\\" or \\"unlucky\\" and he takes their subjective (meaning to involve thoughts and feelings) word for it.  It is from these people's subjective or anecdotal stories (this book is packed with anecdotal stories) that Wiseman derives his conclusions.  (Wiseman also develops \\"Suggested Exercises\\" for the reader to do based on this subjective data.)<br /><br />In other words, this book actually analyses (with the use of graphs) the characteristics of people who think they are lucky.  From this analysis of subjective data, Wiseman comes up with \\"four principles and twelve sub-principles of luck.\\"<br /><br />This book's cover states that these \\"four...principles...will change...your life.\\"  This may be true.  Such things as being more persistent and having a positive attitude are bound to change your life.  You might feel luckier as a result.  Note however, that feeling luckier and actually changing your luck are two different things.<br /><br />Finally, this book is easy to read and has \\"Chapter Summaries.\\"  However, this book has no index.  This would be all right if the table of contents was detailed.  Unfortunately, it is not detailed making it tough to find information that you wish to refer too in the future.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book does contain principles and sub-principles derived from subjective data that may change your life and that may make you feel luckier.<br /><br />(First published 2003; acknowledgements; introduction; your luck journal; 3 parts, 9 chapters; main narrative of 200 pages; appendices; notes)<br /><br />** 1/2<br /><br />+++++tent and having a positive attitude are bound to change your life.

068987474X|1.0|He read it, realized he wanted more than a casual relationship and dumped me
B00005JN2Z|1.0|Let me first say that I LOVED the first 90% or so.  I was riveted.  \\"This action movie,\\" I thought, \\"is different, it's not following the formula for once!\\"  The acting was terrific, and so was the dialogue.  The plucky young cop, who you'd normally expect to help save the day at the end, gets abruptly killed about three fourths of the way in.      All of my enthusiasm and interest leading up to the end only made me MORE furious when the end turned out to be nothing more than a series of cheats, cop-outs, cliches, and plot loopholes, all adding up to make it as predictable and formulaic an ending as any cheesy action flick I've ever seen.  For example:    - The Bad Guy, able to shoot and fight his way out of impossible odds and kill in the blink of an eye when up against side characters, finds his skills severely diminished when he begins battling main characters late in the movie.  WHOOPS!      - The Good Guy shoots the Bad Guy, but of course, just like the formula dictates, it is only a flesh wound, and the Bad Guy rises to continue chasing the Good Guy, only now he's EXTRA MAD!  Ooo!    - The place where the Bad Guy has been SHOT IN THE KNECK stops bleeding within 20 seconds.  I am not exaggerating; as soon as he gts up, the next time we see him his kneck has some DRY blood on it and has not even bled on to his suit collar.    - After being mortally wounded, the Bad Guy has time for one last dramatic little speech.    - The Good Guy and the Bad Guy stand face-to-face about three feet apart and fire about 7 rounds each DIRECTLY AT EACH OTHER, until they both run out of bullets.  Then there's a dramatic pause, after which, OF COURSE, the Bad Guy wilts, having been shot, and the Good Guy looks on, miraculously unscathed (even though the Bad Guy's marksmanship has been, up to this point, superb).  True, the Bad Guy can hit moving targets from up to 30 feet away while doing a diving summersault in a crowded room earlier in the movie, but never mind I guess.  WHOOPS!I mean, YAWN!    - The Good Guy walks away with the Damsel in Distress at the end, giving her his coat to wear and throwing a protective arm around her shoulder.  This, despite MYRIAD loose ends.  I guess this cheesy, pat scene is supposed to be a panacea, like \\"Love Conquers All\\" or something (even though these two characters have only met once before in the movie during a brief cab ride).    I could go on, but you get the idea.  See, I wouldn't mind these things in, say, Die Hard or Lethal Weapon.  You EXPECT those movies to be this kind of [...], and you enjoy them for what they are: mindless tripe with loud booms and gunz blazin.  THIS movie builds up so much interest, banks so much quality dialogue and genuine charachter development, it was a crime to see it squandered on an ending like this.  It was like the writers just stopped trying right at the end.  I was furious, and I sincerely wish I had not wasted my time with this movie.  If you rent it, which I reccommend you don't, do yourself a favor and stop watching IMMEDIATELY after the Good Guy flips the cab.  It's all SEVERELY downhill from there.
068987474X|5.0|I wish I would have read this book 20 years ago, and certainly six years ago before my last boyfriend--THAT relationship would  have lasted four months instead of five years!  For all women who make excuses for men (\\"he's committment phobic\\", \\"he's just not ready\\", \\"he's just waiting until his kids are older\\", \\"he just came off a bad relationship\\", \\"he's been hurt by women\\", \\"he's busy\\", \\"he needs his space\\", blah blah blah ad nauseum) this book is a must read!  The authors tell the story in Dear Abby style, with Behrendt answering the letters and Tuccillo rebutting with a, \\"Yes, I hear what you're saying, BUT...\\"  You get both sides of the argument, but ladies, Greg is right!  Very simply, if your guy's not treating you the way you deserve to be treated, HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU!!!
0688163173|2.0|I know Lehane from the four detective stories featuring Patrick and Angie.  I still remember the first sentence of his I read: \\"A piece of advice: If you follow someone in my nieghborhood, don't wear pink.\\"  The Lehane I knew wrote like Raymond Chandler - tight prose, clever dialog, and street-wise metaphors.<br /><br />I suffer the first 30 pages of Shutter Island.  The only mystery so far is what's up with Lehane's.  Not satisfied with one banal opening sentence, he gives us two - Prologue and Chapter 1.<br /><br />He gives us time as a series of bookmarks that one flips between, memories that inhabit the brain like lit matches, silken velvet, islands that grip the scalp of the sea, globes of oxygen, and sentences that run on and on and on and on and on and on.<br /><br />A character who has just thrown up spends a paragraph describing a sea-worn mirror.  The same character has \\"a dull ache ... just behind his eye, as if the flat side of an old spoon was pressed there.\\"  Flat side of an old spoon, what's that?  Doesn't sound<br /><br />that painful to me.  And what about migraines that \\"turn light into a hailstorm of hot nails.\\"<br /><br />The story may be as good as other reviewers say, as good as one expects from Lehane, but please don't expect Lehane at his best.
B000244EMO|3.0|WOW - one of my favorite movies and the transfer is only slightly better than the previous issue.  The DTS also is only slightly improved.   WHEN are they going to give us a high-def. transfer and remove the grain. If GWTW -1939 can be done, so can Predator.  SHAME on them all.  You wait, another one will probably be coming in the next yr. and we can all dump this copy to buy that one.   So - don't upgrade yet.  Wait for the pristine transfer we all know is coming
6305842442|1.0|Why oh why did they only distribute the director's cut on DVD?<br /><br />It decidedly destroys the entire film noir aspect of the original film's theater release. Without the narrative insight delivered by Harrison Ford's character, this version falls flat. Boring.<br /><br />I'd always thought Ridley Scott was brilliant but I question his choices (and taste) on this release version. I guess it's a good thing the studio intervened on the theater release.<br /><br />I was fooled into buying this director's cut version having no idea it had been so altered, thinking it was the same movie with extra scenes. Hah. Now I treasure my old 1982 VHS version and hope I can preserve it for future enjoyment.<br /><br />The DVD director's cut is worthless to me - except maybe as a coaster.
B00005JLT5|5.0|This movie was just superb. The directing by Roman Polanski was amazing, the acting (especially Brody) made me feel as if I was there experiencing his difficulties along side him. The plot too was great, and the piano playing and music throughout the movie was incredible. Although some parts are slightly disturbing, this movie really brings out the struggles that Jewish men, women, and children had to endure in Warsaw, Poland. Overall, this movie expresses so much feeling that it will forever be in my mind and will forever effect me. This movie is worth buying, can be seen numerous times, and in my book is an instant classic.
B0000041LL|5.0|Whilst I enjoyed the Lindsays Op.127 more thsn the rendition in this set, one doesn't make the whole and there is such consistency here. Each peace is given the attention it deserves and in some cases more - not every piece written by a master is a masterpiece. <br /> <br />Overall and specifically, a fantastic set, a credit to the group and whilst the perfect place to start with these sometimes seemingly impossibly sublime works, I would have no objection to finishing with them as well.
B0006J28BO|5.0|The Cat Returns is about a young girl named Haru. She trudges on the daily routine which is her life, and the only thing different about that certain day is that she saves a cat from a speeding truck. That one good deed brings about so many drastic changes to Haru's once mundane existence that she starts pondering if what she did was right. Soon, our girl finds herself whisked off by dozens of cats with the promise of marriage to the Cat Kingdom's prince -- but not before she enlists the help of the dashing cat Baron, the chubby and sarcastic cat Muta, and the talkative crow Toto. Baron, Muta, and Toto have to save Haru before dawn, or else Haru will lose her humanity and transform into a cat completely. <br /> <br />I thoroughly enjoyed The Cat Returns' perfectly paced and straightforward plot, even if I could already more or less guess how things were going to turn out. It's like a modern day fairy tale, and once again Studio Ghibli's impeccable knack for merging reality and fantasy takes over. The characters are all very likeable as well. Baron is so charismatic and eloquent that I completely understood why Haru eventually developed a crush on him.  <br /> <br />Art and animation-wise, The Cat Returns is exceptionally suave and flawless. From the bustling Japanese cityscape to the serene rustic environment of the Cat Kingdom, each setting was just breathtaking to behold in all its detail and splendor. Character designs are much cuter, less austere, and more anime-sque compared to other Studio Ghibli works. The musical scoring also enhances the overall mood of the film very nicely. <br />         <br />The Cat Returns is nothing short of pure entertainment and pleasure. I loved every minute of it. Since it is one of Studio Ghibli's less emotionally inclined works, it conveys a positive message while leaving the viewer in high spirits. A must-see, and definitely a must-have. <br />
B000063COX|5.0|I got a lot of Iron Maiden CDs (with Bruce Dickinson) before this CD, and this CD is great! I never realized how good of a singer Paul Di'anno was before this. But this CD is a great one. Every track on it is a great one. Probably the best are Running Free, Phantom of the Opera and Charlott the Harlot. I would definitly recommend this CD to a Maiden fan. Long Live Iron Maiden!

I went out and bought the CD with a giftcard I got for christmas.  <br /> <br />Yeah that was a mistake. Vertigo is a great song, but I hated the rest of them. I was hoping the rest of the CD would be as upbeat and as powerful as Vertigo, but it was all soft slower calmer music, and I didn't like it at all.
B0002BO0US|5.0|Many bands (the Beatles, the Beach Boys) at least dabbled in psychedelica, but the Zombies are often overlooked. For the 30th anniversary of \\"Odessey and Oracles,\\" the Zombies' best album was rereleased in a new form, proving that their enchanting psychedelic pop has aged exceeedingly well.<br /><br />The Zombies were unusually good at taking perky, sweet, lush music and wrapping it around a more serious song, such as the upbeat \\"Care of Cell 44\\" (guy writing to his jailed girlfriend), or the lovely \\"A Rose For Emily,\\" a poignant little song that tells of a lonely woman doomed to stay lonely. \\"And as the years go by/she will grow old and die/The roses in her garden fade away/Not one left for her grave...\\"<br /><br />But the Zombies aren't all sadness wrapped in happy music. There are perky songs about being happy in love, losing a love and hoping she'll return, and reminiscing about \\"golden days and golden summer nights.\\" The album ends on a reassuring note with the laid-back \\"Time of the Season,\\" which sounds like the ultimate hippie anthem.<br /><br />I have no memories of the 60s, since I was only born in the eighties. But \\"Odessey and Oracle\\" gives a rosy glow to that era,. Psychedelic flair minus the hazy, and every song is a gem. Though \\"Time of the Season\\" was the sleeper hit from the album, it's not the best or catchiest song on here -- it's just one of many excellent ones.<br /><br />Rod Argent was definitely an outstanding songwriter. He was able to create atmospheric and beautiful songs with very simple writing (\\"Brief candles in her mind/bright and tiny gems of memory\\"). Perhaps his finest moment here is \\"I knew he when summer was her crown/and autumn sad/how brown her eyes,\\" as a kick-off to a colorful look at a woman compared to all the seasons.<br /><br />Colin Blunstone's vocals were well-suited to the music: a bit husky, quite pleasant and mellow. The music itself was generally based on guitar, gentle drums, pretty piano, and wavering Mellotron, with a bit of accordian coming in in one song. There's a rich interweaving of many instruments, in all sorts of pop music. Some is almost classical in tone, some is uptempo stuff that is perfect for the radio.<br /><br />The Zombies were in peak form in \\"Odessey and Oracle,\\" churning out some of the purest pop music ever.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|This set certainly is something to marvel upon. 9 discs. 2 versions of each of the 4 Alien films. I bought it over the summertime for the first time and discovered the greatness of viewing Ridley Scott's Alien for the first time. It was truely a magical experience and the picture & sound are sensation it's hard believe watching Alien it was made more than 25 years ago! Defintley ahead of it's time. The Set, Design, and Giger's design of the Alien all superb. And ofcourse Aliens is just a joyride of action, not as horrific as Alien, but nonetheless, Cameron is a genius and knows how please an audience. Alien 3 & 4 ok but are far from the greatness of the first two films. Overall I am pleased and joyed to own this set. Anyone who has to discover the Alien franchise, this is a great way to discover it, enjoy, and love it for years to come.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Don't be a dumbass and reject Funeral merely because it has garnered so many accolades this past year. That's petty and foolish and you will miss out. Win, Regine, and company have created an album that, in my admittedly uninformed opinion, might stand as the Gen X  version of earlier anthems like  \\"Born to Run\\" and \\"Thunder Road\\". The Arcade Fire does a magnificent job of evoking the melancholy grief of suburban kids who aim to break free of  their white picket fences. Only to find themselves mourning them. The lyrics are thoughtful, empathic, and compelling and they are set against resonant, at times even startling, melodies. This is an album for driving through your hometown late at night, half weepy and half glad that you get to go home to some place else. It's also an album to rollerskate to--  it lifts in upbeat, sonic ways that demand that you move along with its unexpected turns.    Regardless of any hype, it's a hell of a first album. Buy it. It will wake you.  It's fantastic and certainly worth 15 bucks.

I've watched it again many times this Christmas as well sipping my wine in relaxed evenings after work with my girlfriend in my arms -cozy, hysterical, romantic and warm, adorable yes -National Lampoons' Christmas Vacation has become and is tradition over here in Norway.

B00004YW6I|5.0|I feel that this is a very personal album of Polly Jean's.  I can feel that the songs came out of her experiences, as if they had come right out of her skin.  That's what makes this so great.  I also think that it's an album that anyone leaving their twenties and entering their thirties can truly relate to.  PJ's grown up and lightened up about a lot of things, but is, as always, very intelligent, emotional and perceptive.  \\"We Fall\\" is a masterpiece.  This is an album I keep coming back to.
B000001ELF|5.0|Spaceman was probably the best alterego one could have come up for Ace Frehley. But in the world of rock history, it worked well for him and gave Kiss many signatures and much of what Kiss was about relied on Ace's seering guitar work. Paul is highly underrated as a rhythm guitarist, but I can see Ace extremely underrated as a classic axeman. <br /> <br />Ace is sloppy but yet is slick in his presentation, which is what this excellent album is all about. Where \\"New York Groove\\" is sloppy and supurb as a single, \\"Snowblind\\" is possibly one of the best rock tracks of the late 70's. <br /> <br />\\"Speeding Back To My Baby\\" is also classic and more than worthy of FM radio play in it's time and as a classic rock standard of today. However, the world got drowned in \\"New York Groove\\"'s hit appeal (which really does crush the original [Hello, 1977]like a grape). <br /> <br />Hey look, Ace had a more inebriated approach to rock but it was a trademark that made him a fine musician and writer and it was very helpful to establish Ace and Kiss into rock's books forever. And this album was a testimony to it all. <br /> <br />Extremely recommended to all Kiss fans , casual fans and even non-Kiss fans who like good solid hard rock.
B000687M48|4.0|Evanescence is one of the few new bands in the past couple of years that I have succumbed to. Most of the new artists/bands coming out nowadays don't interest me but I honestly can say I like Evanescence. \\"Fallen\\" is one of my favorite albums from 2003. What attracted me to Evanescence's music is Amy Lee's beautiful vocals. I wouldn't go as far as to compare her with Tori Amos but I can certainly hear her influence Amy's vocals. Granted the singles off \\"Fallen\\" were played to death no thanks to heavy rotation on MTV/VH1/Clear Channel-owned radio stations, but that hasn't stopped me from listening to them.<br /><br />As the band is currently putting on the finishing touches on their next album, they recently released a live cd/dvd combo called \\"Anywhere But Home\\". I thought it was appropriately titled since the band spent most of the past year and a half (at least) on the road. Normally I don't buy live cds but I thought this live combo package was worth owning. There are a few 'new' songs which I really wanted to hear. I never heard the original version but I dug Evanescence's cover of Korn's \\"Thoughtless\\". \\"Missing\\" and \\"Breathe No More\\" I thought those two ballads were excellent and destined to be Evanescence classics. The dvd was great to watch. I really dug the behind the scenes footage of the band, and the concert footage was good too. The only flaw with this package is the somewhat muddled production. It definitely could have been better. Maybe \\"Anywhere But Home\\" is a cash cow for the band and record label but it is a pretty decent appetizer until the band puts out a new album (which I hope will be sometime this year).
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|Did anyone else happen to walk out of this movie with their eyes strained and their stomach hurting? I saw this movie and Bourne Identity side by side and there is a definite difference in the style of cinematography.<br /><br />The story seemed a little fast in the begining in order to bring Bourne back into the picture. The rest of the story was great, everyone had ample character development. They played the same idea with Bourne forgetting something and needing to find out but tied it up into another plot of spy games. Makes you wonder if spies ever live happily ever after.<br /><br />Back to the cinematography, normally I'd rank this a five star movie but I couldn't get it out of my head on how jumpy the movie was. Every part had this bouncy feeling to it that just drove you nuts. I see a lot of people giving this movie good reviews but I see no one commenting on the bad cinematography job. I thought I'd pitch in my two cents. Good movie to watch, not a good movie to entertain guests.
B000286RNY|5.0|Oh, wow... I just saw this movie tonight, and from about five minutes in, I couldn't stop laughing.  At one point, I fell off the couch, laughing, with tears streaming from my eyes.   <br /> <br />Seriously.  I haven't laughed this much during a movie since... since... never.  Kung Fu soccer!!!

B00005JLEX|5.0|Seinfeld is arguably the greatest sitcom of all time by making a bold decision in making a sitcom purely about everyday stuff like Soup Nazis or \\"Friends With Privaleges\\" deals. In the first and second seasons the show changed television by, instead of making a show about spys or other ridiculous non-beliveable subjects, made a show about the every day human life which is essentially \\"Nothing\\"!!!! That is why seinfeld,whether about ridiculous food waits in chinese and other restuarants or about the sweet sweet taste of revenge, has still left a mark on television that can never be removed or copied, which is proof that Seinfeld, the smartest,cleverest,and possibly funniest, sitcom of all times is still just as relevant...

B000002H33|5.0|Hi. <br /> <br />I am really going to recommend this album more than any other albums I've ever recommnded before.  It is stunning.  There are 8 tracks- some, such as battery and Disposable Heroes drift off more into the realms of thrash metal.  If you want a good length hardcore energetic and LOUD metal album, then this is blatantly for you. <br /> <br />Made in 1986, this album peaked at number 2.  This was an immensely underrated album.   Easily 1st in the album charts material.  Metallica did well to continue after Cliff Burton, the bassist died in a road accident in Sweden during their tour.  This unfortunate incident nearly drove them apart.  They resisted this temptation and continued, and the result was possibly the greatest all time heavy metal album. <br /> <br />I have outlined the songs. <br /> <br />1. Battery. 5*  i really like this song.  A good acoustic intro, then hoarse, aggresive, yet tuneful vocals from James Hetfield.   This moves at an extremely fast pace, and may take you a couple of days to get into it, then ull love it. <br /> <br />2. Master of Puppets.5*  Hailed as the second greatest heavy metal song ever, this one deserves to come the greatest.  Behind Black Sabbath, Paranoid, which in my view,is not strictly speaking a heavy metal song, it is underratd.  Anyway- back to the point- Arguably the best on the album, this 8.34 long track is incredible- there is so much amazing contrast- between fierce loud heavy metal and more bluesy based stuff(from the acoustic guitar solo in the middle).  Id get it just for this song... HONESTLY! <br /> <br />3.  The Thing that should not Be. 4*.  I like this song.  The sloweset on the album, it has a good steady pace, relitavely slow, and good distortion guitar backing riff.  Can be a bit repetitive though. <br /> <br />4. Welcome Home(sanitarium). 5*  My personal favourite.  I cant really describe how it;s so good- it just is.  Careful you don't delve too deep into the lyrics though. Too much thought can be quite haunting (based on personal experience). <br /> <br />5. Disposable Heroes.  5*  This is about the depression of the first worl war soldiers.  The lyrics describe how they hate life at the front, and all that.  Very Depressing, but good song good guitar... well good everything.  Not the album's best though. <br /> <br />6.  Leper Messiah. 4*  The best part of this song is the chorus('BOW TO LEPER MESSIAH')  This is 5* material, but is kinda let down by the rest of the song. <br /> <br />7.  Orion[instrumental]. 5*  I think this is an amazing piece of musicianship.  I think the way it builds up is amazing, starting energetically, then going more bluesy, then back to the faster, energetic metal, then finishing. :-) <br /> <br />8. Damage inc. 4*   This is in completely the wrong place.  It is the worst album ender i ever heard.  Seriously.  Oh well- at least it's a reasonable song, nevertheless. <br /> <br />Well- that's it.  My favourite ever album.  They did phenominally well thgat Cliff Burtonb died halfway through making it.  Just a good thing they didnt give up. <br /> <br />Anyway.  Seriously buy it.  It will NOT be a waste of money. <br /> <br />Thank you very much <br /> <br />Matt <br /> <br />
B000000OQF|5.0|I've written very long reviews of Guns N' Roses' later CDs...here I'm at a loss for words. Simply put, this is a fantastic album - nothing short of amazing. Every track is a winner. There isn't a single bad song. And, there are many classics - including \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" and my personal favorite, \\"Sweet Child O' Mine.\\" <br /> <br />This is the hard, dirty, sleazy, over-the-top, excessive rock band that revolutionized the industry in the late '80s/early '90s...until grunge took over. Thankfully, Gn'R-style-rock is coming back in a big way with Velvet Revolver and other \\"retro\\" bands. <br /> <br />I digress... <br /> <br />In short this is a must-buy for anyone looking to get into Gn'R, hard rock or even music in general. Almost twenty years later it's still selling 20,000 copies a week worldwide. You do the math.
0399226907|5.0|I don't know exactly what my two-year-old sees in this book, but he has had a special affinity for it since it was given as a gift a year ago. It may be the varying size of pages that he appreciates. The holes that represent where the caterpillar has eaten may also interest him. There is also a rythym to the text that may please his ears.<br /><br />For me, I enjoy the artwork very much though I am not sure how the illustrations were done. Some of these appear to be made by pasting and photographing textured paper into leaves and a caterpillar. The book is also sturdy and has survived being carried around as my child's favorite book and a trip to the hospital where it comforted him.
B000008GAC|1.0|Appetite for Destruction is arguably the best debut album of all time. The \\"censored\\" version is not very good. Most of the material is very poorly censored and although I respect the idea of censoring the music, I don't support it - because frankly kids should not be listening to Guns N' Roses, and if adults have a problem with mild language (and it is quite mild here) they just shouldn't be listening to Gn'R! Sometimes profanity filters are good (such as the one I purchased for my television for family viewing) - but editing a hard rock CD isn't a good idea since the content to begin with is pretty hardcore. I mean, the very idea of censoring \\"naughty words\\" from ROCKET QUEEN is hilarious - forget about the recorded female orgasm that plays midway through, just make sure they don't say any bad words!
B0000251VZ|3.0|I don't understand the hype with this album, and I am a huge Maiden fan. In my opinion it is one of the weaker releases with Dickinson. However, it still has great tracks I enjoy listening to like 2 minutes to midnight, aces high, powerslave and rime of the ancient mariner. Losfer Words is also pretty good, but not as good as previous instrumentals. Also, I find that the other songs on the album are weak. If you are a huge Maiden fan I understand why you would buy this album, but if not I suggest checking out the self-titled debut or Piece of Mind, both which are better overall in my opinion.
B00005JMUL|5.0|If you love Christmas movies, or animated movies, then this movie should really excite you, it combines Christmas and animation all into one. And if you are a big Tom Hanks fan, then this should really get you happy, he is cast in 5 roles in the movie, so there wouldb't be to many scenes without Tom Hanks. The movie also has the voices of Jimmy Bennett, Eddie Deezen, and the late Michael Jeter. The movie set up is this, on Christmas Eve a train stops in front of boys and girl's house that cause trouble, or start doubting the existance of Santa Claus (Tom Hanks) and takes them to the North Pole to meet Santa, and he picks one child to get the first present. So it is the night of Christmas Eve, a tain pulls up the hero Boy's (Tom Hanks again) house, the train's Conductor gets out to greet him, and every child's house they stop, the boy asks to where, and the Conductor says the North Pole, of course the boy doesn't want to get on, but changes his mind in time before he leaves his house. On the train is other children including Hero Girl (Nona Gaye, daughter of the late singer Marvin Gaye). The conductor takes the children's ticket, which somehow magical appears. But forgets about the hero girl, but when Hero Boy discovers the ticket, the boy loses the ticket, and the conductor takes the girl away.
B0002VEPRQ|4.0|I just found out the Travers is a fellow Aussie. Her books have been an inspiration to yound and old alike. An inspiring screen adaptation.
0671027387|4.0|The characters are architypical and you definitely shouldn't believe every technical \\"fact\\" dropped to push the plot forward, but I found Deception Point to be a fun, quick read. I'd recommend it if you're looking for something that is not particularly deep but still technically engrossing like Crichton or Brown's other novels. I actually found the conclusion in Deception Point to be more satisfying than Da Vinci Code (a fun ride, but disappointing ending) or Angels and Demons (great climax, but a cliche anti-climactic ending), even if the plotting style in Deception Point is a bit more frustrating.<br /><br />The greatest downside in my opinion is the political subplot which has a premise that is a stretch to begin with (I doubt NASA could ever become a life or death campaign issue). Extreme, stereotypical characters and details that seem ripped off from a poor West Wing episode don't help suspension of disbelief. The plotting of the story is also a bit frustrating as secrets are kept from the reader for a little bit too long (the trick of hiding from the reader what the characters are currently observing or discovering, sometimes for over 10 chapters or more, is used much too often). However, the primary \\"action/science\\" plot-line has plenty enough technically engrossing details and mystery to sustain the energy of the story and easily kept me interested. Of course, I am not an astrophysicist or oceanographer, so any inaccuracies didn't bother me (your milage may vary).
B0006A9FMI|5.0|Director Mamoru Oshii takes another dive into the surreal cybernetic world of Shirow Masamune's Ghost in The Shell for a second feature-length release.  Again produced by cutting edge animation house Production I.G., Innocence expands on Oshii's exploration of what it means to be human and the nature of consciousness.  It appears some time has passed as well, since all of the characters have a slightly older look to them, especially Chief Aramaki and information guru Ishikawa.  Since the event of Major Kusanagi's merger with project 2501 and resulting flight into cyberspace at the end of the first film, Togusa has been assigned to work directly with Batou on a tough new case involving prototypes of a new robot model, making for some interesting interplay between the characters as they attempt to become accustomed to each other's working style.  Batou becomes the focus this time around and we get something of a glimpse into his homelife as well as his personality and the effect the Major's departure has had on him.  <br />Stylistically, the film's characters are drawn in a similar fashion as before, but now the scenery has been rendered using 3-D graphics.  This doesn't make everything look like a video game though, as the crew visited several cities around the globe getting ideas for settings and the visual style, which appears at times to have a gauze effect over the screen to give a hazy film quality to it.  This time around, there's more of an obvious reference to the dolls of surrealist Hans Bellmer as well, as the story plays up the aspect of the future where most &quot;people&quot; are actually either cybernetically enhanced or have &quot;dolls&quot; for bodies into which their consiousness has been transferred, and live interconnected by the internet.  Throughout the film there are many quotes from the likes of Asimov, Descartes and the Old Testament, which very much suits its philisophical nature.  This also meshes nicely with the notion that in a society where most people are wired to the internet through their e-brains, presumably having access to all that knowledge would allow for deeper insight.  It isn't all bookwormish contemplation though, and fans will be pleased with the action sequences that take place periodically, especially toward the end.  Expanding on the concepts brought forth in the first film, Innocence takes everything to the next level in terms of overall presentation, style and providing a vehicle for the audience to explore their own relationship with technology and its impact not only on our lives, but on our selves as well.<br />Given 5 stars as I regard it as the best film I've seen in 2004.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|From the opening note of overture in Wicked, I knew I'd be seeing one amazing show. And I did. In fact, the only times I was bored during the production was when the wizard sang--his 2 songs are bland, pointless, and dull (I feel like they were added just because he was a main character and needed material). <br /> <br />Some people gave this CD one star. I've heard some people say this show is stupid unless you're under age eleven. That makes me laugh out loud, because at times this play can be very complex and political. The songs are undeniably catchy, no matter how old you are. And anyone who has seen the Wizard of Oz will enjoy matching up each respective character in Wicked. And even though the stories do not mesh perfectly all the time (example: why would the wicked witch keep throwing fire at the scarecrow if he was her lover?), Wicked still has a brilliant storyline.  <br /> <br />Another complaint I often hear: \\"Why did they have to change Wicked so much from the book??\\" \\"They shouldn't have changed the ending!\\" \\"It's a disgrace to the novel!\\" Blah, blah, BLAH! Those whiny losers who keep griping about that really get on my nerves (no offense). Since I have not read the novel myself, I can make no personal comments. But I can say this much: one of my best friends read the book and saw the play. He now believes the book sucked in comparison. My cousin: read the book and liked it, heard Wicked's soundtrack and loved it. I told him the general storyline, and he kept laughing at all the changes. But he said he was sure the play was great, and he really enjoyed listening to the music.  <br /> <br />Once more, I am telling you that this show is a great piece of work. Everyone involved should be proud of it. And the music is excellent! There are the fun songs, such as \\"Popular,\\" \\"What Is This Feeling,\\" and \\"Dancing Through Life\\"; the poignant ones, \\"No One Mourns The Wicked,\\" \\"I'm Not That Girl,\\" \\"No Good Deed,\\" and \\"For Good.\\" And what CD is complete without theboring, skip-every-time songs?? Namely, the wizard's!! (\\"I Am A Sentimental Man\\"--or something like that, I don't even know what it's called--and the never-ending \\"Wonderful\\"). But, crappy songs aside, the rest is really a masterpiece.
0582342988|4.0|I thought I'd find this book boring (I mean, how interesting can a butler's life be? Ok, maybe they tend to be witnesses to sordid affairs but I didn't think this was such a book). In any case, I was wrong -- it was an intriguing study of human relationships and emotions. <br /> <br />This wasn't just a novel about an English butler in post-war England -- this was a book illustrating management principles. I'd rename the book \\"The remains of the day: Lessons in management\\". : ) <br /> <br />The novel was an intriguing insight to an aspect of English life not intially apparent to me. It was also a study into a very believable aspect of human behaviour, albeit brought to extremes by the Stevens character. I had mixed reactions towards him as a person, some not very flattering. However, by the end of the book, I felt sorry for him. He was, in my opinion, trying to make sense of the world as best as he could. As much as he tried to detach himself from human emotions (his own coping mechanism towards the complexities of human relationships), in the end he reveals himself to be very human simply by showing regret.
B00000IFP6|5.0|I thought I knew Beethovens Symphonies inside out until I heard these staggering performances. Notwithstanding the excellent 1963 Karajan cycle (albeit with,as we now know, incorrect scores, markings and Tempos) and the several excellent \\"period\\" versions by Bruggen, and Gardiner et al, this Zinman Cyle really is as good as any other, and in terms of taughtness and control, and accuracy to the composers wishes, quite unbeaten. Anyone wishing for a set of Beethoven that is not fussy, engineered, altered, romanticised, or just plain \\"got at\\" need look no further. It would have been a revelation to have had the added bonus of original instruments and tuning, but these things aside, the set is magnificently played, and is a credit to Zinman. Klemperer and the myriad of other \\"romantic\\" conductors will seem positively dull in the shadow of this, and the Urtext scores, used in these recordings finally realises Beethoven as Beethoven, and makes us all need to bury our own preferences and rehear these works accurately played. 1000 out of 10. Buy them!

I am so shocked that they got everything so cool into the movie.

B00006AW2J|5.0|First of all, this is a great cd, and anyone who likes it should go pick up the &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Circus&quot; DVD if they want to hear some drug-fueled versions of a couple of this album's tunes. Second of all, the Stones didn't copy the beatles with the cover with the handwriting on it, it was meant to look like an invitation. Also, last time I checked the Beatles weren't the the only rock band to use a sitar. Besides, George was friends with Ravi Shankar who taught him, so if you're going to say the Stones copied the Beatles, I guess the Beatles copied Shankar.
B00008H2LB|2.0|This album has everything that made Hybrid Theory so successful. The catchy melodies and rhythms and rapping. However, this album is not a big leap from Hybrid Theory. The musicianship is no more advanced and the songs are still just as predictable, possibly even more so. The majority of the songs on this album follow the exact same structure.  <br /> <br />Instrumental Intro <br />Verse(rapped or sung) <br />Prechorus <br />Chorus <br />Verse <br />Prechorus <br />Chorus <br />Bridge <br />Corus <br /> <br />The songs \\"Don't Stay\\", \\"Somewhere I Belong\\", \\"Lying From You\\", \\"Hit the Floor\\", \\"Faint\\", \\"Figure.09\\", \\"Breaking the Habit\\", \\"From the Inside\\", \\"Nobody's Listening\\", \\"Numb\\" generally follow this form. There is an advantage in doing this because it allows Linkin Park to consistently churn out catchy songs. So as a result, many of the songs are of similar quality. This formula was also prevalent on Hybrid Theory. If you play Numb and Pushing Me Away together, you'll find that each verse and chorus etc. starts at nearly the exact same time. The lyrics are also similar. Several of the songs are about the lyricist taking himself back from another person. The others are about healing or facing the pain. Nothing too special. <br /> <br />Most people who are into this type of music probably don't mind that most of the songs are very similar in music, structure, melody and lyric. If this is the case, then I would recommend Meteora and Hybrid Theory. If you like variety, I would look elsewhere. <br /> <br />
0345347951|5.0|As a kid I always used to think of aliens as bad creatures.  Scary creatures.  But this book has changed a lot of views for me, I would never thought of Aliens creating a Utopia of our world.  This book is amazing, it keeps you hooked and reading.  Everyone should read this at least to get a new view on how to look at other extra terrestial creatures rather than thinking of them as creatures taking over the world and killing everyone.  Like an Independence Day situation.  So if you want a good book to read, then take this one, you won't be sorry.
0060589272|5.0|Paulo Coelho's \\"Eleven Minutes\\" basically explores the life of Maria from her childhood to becoming a young adult, and her discoveries of sex and love.  She's continually disturbed by the fact that she has never had an orgasm by a man and is intrigued when she first does and the times after that as well.  Being a prostitute, Maria is distraught that though she has had plenty of sex, she doesn't really comprehend sex and at first believes that its sole purpose is for mere pleasure.  Maria eventually encounters the sacred nature of sex and in her struggle to discover the wisdom of sex, she uncovers her true self and desires.   <br /> <br />Despite how others may connect \\"The Alchemist\\"'s Santiago with Maria, Maria proves to be a different character in that Maria is a woman and that really does make all the difference.  In this book, Coelho successfully weaves a woman's wisdom and intuition into the main character, allowing the female reader to connect with Maria and understand what she goes through and how she feels.  If anything, this story is more similiar to Coelho's \\"By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept\\" than \\"The Alchemist\\".   <br /> <br />I thought it was remarkable how Paulo Coelho wrote the book as if he knew what it felt like to be a woman.  This book should definately be read by a woman or someone mature enough to comprehend the wisdom of sex, and there were numerous times when I identified myself with Maria.  Her encounters with sex and life felt very similar to my own and this book inspired within me hope and an urge to change my lifestyle.   <br /> <br />I have read 6 of his other books and I'm definately a fan of his.  The overall tone and message of his books are all the same and if you agree with his philosophies and ideas, then you'll enjoy this book.  However, if you've read one of his books and didn't like it, chances are this book just isn't for you, as well as any of his other books.  To other Paulo Coelho avid readers, this is by far my favorite of his books and I encourage you guys to read it.   <br /> <br />To get the most out of this book, read it with an open mind and don't judge it until you finish reading the whole book (unfortunately some certain new yorker decided to write a review on this book without even finishing it...).  There are some \\"controversial\\" topics about sex dealt with in this book but really this book has nothing to do with pornography and is  very deep.
0800141660|5.0|Lush production value encompasses this flawless film based on the classic Jane Austen novel.  Emma Thompson is triumphant both as the title character and as a screenwriter.  Her adaptation is beautifully written and loaded with emotional subtleties, as is her performance.  Kate Winslet plays her sister in the film, a perfect foil of unrepressed passion to her sister's reserved depth of character.  The entire cast is magnificent, for that matter.  There are so many different characters entering and exiting the story that there is never any threat of boredom for lack of interesting people.  The story itself is actually fairly simple, but it is the people who inhabit this fascinating time and place who both complicate and enhance everything around them.  The cinematography is sumptuous, with deep greens and glowing sunshine, misty grays and extravagantly colorful indoor settings.  The costumes are gloriously adorned and appropriately designed for the era.  The look of this film is fantastic!  Then there is director Ang Lee, better known today for his stellar work on \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\\"  His previous film, \\"Eat Drink Man Woman,\\" more than hinted at his prowess as a possible international success with \\"Sense and Sensibility.\\"  His work here is outstanding.  This film was nominated for 7 Oscars, winning only for Best Adapted Screenplay going to Emma Thompson.  Another movie entitled \\"Braveheart\\" won Best Picture that year.  Other films along similar lines as \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" that I recommend highly are \\"Howard's End,\\" in which Emma Thompson won the Best Actress Oscar but which is inexplicably not available on DVD, and an eccentric gem called \\"Impromptu,\\" in which she has a smaller role within yet another exceptional cast of actors.  Both films are very European, in the best sense of the word.  Highly recommended.
B00003CX97|5.0|\\"Officers --- to work!!\\"  Colonel Saito    The soundtrack is awe-inspiring, alternating between the natural wilderness sounds of wildlife and insects calling and whirring in the depths of a sweltering southeast asian rainforest and then swelling into the whistling of World War II British POW work gangs and a stirring fully orchestrated marching tune.      The plot is an amazing blend of real life events with fiction, along the lines of the Great Escape and Stalag 17, both set in German war camps, being culled and amalgamated from the true experiences of brit and american pows.      The actors are all terrific.  To me, Guinness's Col. Nicholson wins with his water-to-wine, rabbit-from-a-hat bravery and love of his men.     I find it very difficult to read or watch stuff about the Pacific World War II theater, from Pearl Harbor to the Battan Death March to the Battle of Midway to Iwo Jima to Burma.  Scattered across all these places, in both marked and unmarked graves, are soldiers and civilians who lost their lives, many as prisoners of war.      They are free now, wherever they are.  Their deaths were not meaningless, and their deaths are connected to our lives, because we owe our freedom, those of us in the free world, that is, to the outcome of WWII.      People who simplistically talk about the 'pointlessness of war' do an injustice to those who have found themselves staring down the wrong end of a gun.  When your survival is at stake, then fighting for your freedom with whatever tools you have at hand doesn't seem pointless.    This movie would have been hard to watch too had I not originally seen it as a kid, when I really knew nothing at all so I just took it on face value.     The first thing that I noticed was the soldiers' whistling.  I don't know what the original words to the Col. Bogey March are, but I'm sure they are very colorful, along the lines of \\"I've don't know but I've been told...!\\" The g-rated kids version is: \\"Comet, it makes your teeth turn green, comet, it tastes like gasoline, comet, it makes you vomit, so drink some comet, and vomit, today!\\"      Of course, later I realized that the imprisoned soldiers are whistling to keep up their spirits, maintain order, etc.  I didn't realize they were supposed to be starving, bent over with dysentery and malaria, etc.  In fact, when I saw this, I was blissfully ignorant of the whole concept of death camps and death marches.    What I noticed later was the story of the bridge being built, falling down, being built better, and why it is built, why it should be destroyed, and how it all is played out while men are dying.      Monty Python's Flying Circus had a hilarious sketch that spoofed the war movies where the commander rousts malingering patients out of their beds to report for duty.  POWs on crutches and swathed with bandages are made to jog and do calisthenics, while a very Col. Nichols -ish John Cleese or Graham Chapman barks orders.      Is this a sign that Col. Nicholson has gone around the bend by this point in the proceedings?  Good question.      The men are being used as slave labor to build a bridge that will help the enemy.  Apparently word has come down to Saito that this bridge needs to be built, and that he is to use the British prisoners to build it.     But Saito has not been provided with any bridge engineers to oversee operations, or even a set of bridge building instructions, apparently, or at least, not any good ones.      Of course, it would behoove the British to not do a good job on the bridge.  In fact for them to do a good job on the bridge would seem to be giving aid and comfort to the enemy. So before Nicholson takes over the project, the work is being done haphazardly, either by incompetence or on purpose. But it turns out that Nicholson and his officers know a thing or two about bridge building, something akin to what an Army Corps of Engineers would be able to accomplish.      And for Nicholson and by extension the British Empirehe represents to do something badly just goes against the grain.  Maybe it's counterintuitive to him, maybe it's that nature abhors a vacuum.      Also, Nicholson apparently decides that building the bridge well represents a goal, a carrot on a stick to keep morale up and, hopefully, prolong the lives of at least some of his enfeebled but tough men.      Some, including Major Shears, interpret Nicholson's forbidding his men to escape as bad leadership, a way of giving in and giving up to inevitable death.  On the other hand, the chances for survival if one did manage to escape were about on the level of someone escaping from a Siberian prison camp.      Col. Nicholson may just as well have told them to lay down and die for all the good it would have done anyone.  In fact, in terms of tying up the enemy's men and equipment, that was more effectively done by them staying in camp.  If they ran away, Col. Saito would only have spent a minimal amount of men and resources trying to catch them, since he knows they'll likely die out there anyway.      We all have had a painful realization that we've lost sight of the big picture.       At some point while trying to help his men survive, Nicholson has lost track of the part about not helping the enemy.  Hardly surprising considering the strain he is under.  It's not like he had a neat little guidebook, with reminders like \\"be sure to include secret exploding bolts in the bridge construction\\".      Nicholson's eventual, agonizing realization is the more dramatic as he has only seconds to try and fix his mistake.      For those who insist this is an anti-war picture, as that may well have been Lean's take on the story, but does that mean he thinks the soldiers and civilians in WWII who fought for freedom, did so in vain?  Does he think people should have just laid down and died, not tried to fight back?  I'd like to have seen him try to realize his artisic vision had things turned out differently.      The relationship betweenAlec Guinness/Col. Nicholson and Sessue Hayakawa/Col. Saito.  The dynamics of that are very complex.    Another reviewer commented on how excellent the commando team sent to destroy the bridge is.  Bedeviled by one problem after another, they adapt and move on under incredibly tough conditions. The women who are part of the team are just as tough as they help the men hack their way across the wilderness.      Also, the motivations of the commando team are complex and fascinating, and I haven't begun to meal over that in my watching of this film.  Reading the comments of other viewers has given me much to mull over next time I watch BOTRK.    This is a movie to be seen, and learned from, over and over and over again.

6304479689|3.0|Some of the previous reviews have already touched on what I would have to say so I'll keep this short.  \\"Elvis on Tour\\" is nowhere near as good as \\"That's the Way It Is\\".  The performances are weaker, the song selection (in my opinion) is poorer since he doesn't sing most of the great songs for which he is known, and the overall structure of the film lacks the coherence and polish of \\"That's the Way It Is\\".  And on a fairly superficial level, Elvis looks a lot better in \\"That's the Way It Is\\"-tanned and leaner.  Tanned, anyway.  Better hair, too, for what that's worth.  True, those are superficial things but they do make a difference to one's sense of \\"The King\\".  I had seen \\"That's the Way It Is\\" awhile back and thought it was one of the best concert films I'd seen; I expected more of the same with \\"Elvis on Tour\\" but was sadly disappointed.  So if you give five stars to this movie, you'd have to go off the scale when rating \\"That's the Way It Is\\", such is the difference in these two movies.
0066620996|1.0|This book has a lot of conservative religious bigotry and cult-like zeal in it.  Not to mention, it is full of drama, evangelized stories :  \\"16 years of struggle, Mockler crumpled to the floor, struck dead by a massive heart attack\\".  Maybe the author should have put yet more drama and said: a tsunami came and Mockler was carried through it in the shadow of holy spirit.   <br /> <br />We must build a society of tolerance and respect for all, not preach such masked hate ideologies as delivered discreetly in the book all over.

B0001YRVN4|5.0|I am absolutely sick of people whining and complaining about the changes Lucas made to his movies. Well Mr./Mrs. I-Hate-The-Special-Editions, did you create Star Wars? Are these your stories to tell? Did Greedo shoot first? WHO CARES?! These are the most minute of details Lucas is changing. As for the change of Anakins in Jedi, listen to Lucas' commentary on that scene before you start complaining. Besides, no matter how much you whine and throw a hissy fit over the changes Lucas makes to HIS MOVIES (I feel I have to emphasize that) he won't listen. These are the versions he wants to make available. He wants to tie these in with his prequels. If you want the original versions, go buy one of the many bootlegged laser discs turned DVDs of them. The way I see it, sit down, SHUT UP, and just watch Star Wars without complaining about miniscule changes. Enjoy it while it lasts, Star Wars is coming to an end. So please, for the sake of the fans who don't give a rat's *@! as long as it's STAR WARS, please STOP WHINING!
B0002HTZJI|5.0|Throughout their 20+ years the Red Hot Chili Peppers have been known for their amazing live shows and have been one of the biggest selling live bands for the past 15 years now. Now fans finally have a offical document of such an amazing live band on cd from the biggest performance (and record breaking) shows of the bands career. Not only was this the fastest recorded/released live album ever but the shows in which the music is taken from set European attendence records as well. I have noticed a bit of disapoinment with the tracklisting but for the most part these are the songs the band played throughout their By The Way tour. I know alot of people would love to hear some older stuff from the EMI days (aka pre-Blood Sugar days) and as would I though the band is clearly focused on the new music they are making, which is equally as great as the older funkier more raw Peppers sound. Personally I wasn't a huge fan of the By The Way setlists mainly because it focused on the last two albums (which were both amazing and By The Way is quickly becoming my favorite Peppers record) and when they did dip back into the older stuff it was only the hits from Blood Sugar. I have been a huge fan for 13 years now so Give It Away and Under The Bridge just don't do it for me anymore like they did back in the early 90's. I have heard those songs live tons of times but of course leaving them out of the sets would be like the Stones leaving out Brown Sugar or Satisfaction. I guess we have to take what we get though with alot of these songs that i've heard many times each time they are played something new is added like the song being extended or various little jams, which are staples at every Peppers. The best part of this two disc set is the two new tracks. Rolling Sly Stone is a throwback to the Blood Sugar era and Leverage Of Space sounds like your average By The Way b'side (good song though not my favorite). It would be interesting to hear studio versions of each but as of right now the Peppers do not plan on adding them to their next record, which is expected to be much more raw and heavier that By The Way and is due in the Summer of 2005. Maybe the biggest treat for Peppers fans who collect all the bootlegs and who have seen them live tons of times is the live debut of Get On Top, which sounds amazing and which was played for the first time at the Hyde Park shows. My only major complaint other than the minor complaints about the set lists, which really don't bother me is the fact that when Flea is talking you have to really crank the volume up to hear him. The same goes for Anthony in some spots.  <br /> <br />All and all it's a great cd and a great introduction to the live Peppers vibe if you haven't already seen them. Sure it's the not the raw, agressive, juvinile Peppers of the 80's but it's no longer the 80's anymore and people do grow up and evolve.

From Suspicious , Catch a thief and obviously this one could not be the exception of the rule<br /><br />Hitchcock always knew to show the other side of the actor , specially if he was a renowned and glamorous star .

B0002KVUKM|1.0|I first heard about this film over two years ago and became excited at the possibility of some of Universal's classic monsters together in one film doing battle with Van Helsing. I knew it wasn't going to be your typical horror film mainly because the guy behind the two Mummy films from the late 90's was behind this and both were fun movies and interesting re-tellings of the Mummy story. When I first saw the trailer for Van Helsing in early 2004 my almost 2 years of excitment were quickly flushed down the toilet. Now i'm not one to judge a movie based on just the trailer and will give anything a shot but from the  minute and a half trailer I knew this was going to be awful. I waited until the film hit dvd to see it though friends of mine saw it opening weekend and one friend loved it (though he also thought the Resident Evil films were some of the best zombie flicks ever made) and another friend wanted to walk out of the theater. Boy do I wish I took that 2nd friends advice and didn't waste $3.50 on the rental of this piece of garbage. Still I popped the disc in and was going to try and keep an open mind about it. I knew I would hate the CGI (more on that in a moment) but it could be a fun movie like the Mummy films. NOPE! The acting is some of the worst acting that i've ever seen in a film. Hugh Jackman, who was perfectly cast as Wolverine in the X-Men films is at his very worst and his acting is just as great as some of the low budget 80's horror flicks i've seen (and those are actors who are most likely working at McDonalds right now). The dialouge and the cheesy one liners might appeal to 12-14 year old boys into Nu Metal music but I found them to be very laughable and painful to sit through. <br /> <br />As for the CGI. It's hands down some of the worst i've ever seen. The interaction between real human actors and CGI characters are some of the worst i've seen. The CGI is at it's worst during the Dr. Jekell fight and every scene involving Dracula's Brides. It'sfunny now looking back on Jar Jar Binks and he just seems so real compaired to the CGI in Van Helsing. The CGI in this film is on par with Scooby Doo and Garfield, two of the worst uses of CGI in movie history. It's interesting that back in 1992 when CGI was still being brought to life how amazing the Dinosaurs in Jurrassic Park looked and 12-13 years later it seems like technology has taken a huge step backwards when I see films like Van Helsing. My advice...stick to the Universal classics from the 30's and 40's. The best thing to come from the release of this horrible film was Universal re-releasing their classic monster movies on dvd.
6305511055|5.0|The incredible plot of this engrossing script will involve you from start to finish . The dark intimate of an Information Agency through the figure of a simple reader - Redford makes he knows too many things he should not be noticed . That will be the essential and dramatic focus for an implacable chase . If you consider this golden cast : Max von Sydow , Faye Dunaway and Clift Robertson you will understand why this film has reached a privileged status at the moment you make the choice of the best bit nail thrillers of the seventies .<br /><br />The sixth best acting of Mr. Redford after The Candidate , Sundance Kid , The Great Gatsby and The Chase and The Great Waldo Pepper
B00007FOMP|5.0|While I am not a fan of soul music or R&B in general, this album is one of the few exceptions. Marvin Gaye pours his inner soul and feelings into his greatest work. Inner City Blues is a gem. As is the title track. This album is consistently voted in the top ten greatest albums of alltime polls. And its definately worthy, as it makes a statement more so than many other albums found in those polls, Bob Dylan being an exception. This album will remain one of the best recordings ever.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|FIrst of all, let it be known that \\"Innocence\\" is the latest addition to Oshii's numerous works of genius. His unique style of filmmaking, in both live-action and animation, is truly ahead of its time in every sense of the word. \\"Innocence\\" stands on its own as a work of art. This isn't just another action anime. Oshii has gone all-out to include as many of his philosophical ideas as possible in the film; almost every shot contains symbollic representations of his message. This film will make you think, whether you like it or not. No doubt some may find it boring, but that is always the case with these kinds of movies. Not everybody is going to appreciate it. <br /> <br />Despite the greatness of this movie, though, I cannot reccomend buying the DVD. For lack of a better word, it is a piece of crap. You see, for its theatrical release, \\"Innocence\\" was never dubbed, and was left in its original japanese language format with english subtitles. Personally, I applaud this decision. \\"Millenium Actress\\" was released in the same way, another great work of animation. However, on the \\"Innocence\\" DVD, there is no regular english subtitle track. Instead, this track turns out to be a \\"closed caption\\" one, that writes all the sounds out on screen and identifies off-screen speakers for deaf people. That means you have no choice but to watch the movie with \\"[SOUND OF HELICOPTER APPROACHING]\\" and \\"[SOUND OF FISHTANK BUBBLING]\\" appearing along with the dialouge at the bottom of the screen. <br /> <br />Oddly enough, there is no selectable option for \\"closed caption\\" subtitles on the set-up menu. It is labled as the normal \\"english\\" subtitle track. <br /> <br />There is no excuse for a mistake like this. Anyone could see what was wrong by just watching the first thirty seconds of the movie. This means that NOBODY at Dreamworks watched the DVD before it was cleared for mass-production. They just sent it out without checking. Personally, I have no idea how a bizarre screw-up like thiswas made. <br /> <br />I expect Dreamworks to recall this DVD, and to provide fixed versions free of charge to all those who purchased it (and while they're at it, providing some decent-looking cover art would also be appreciated. Why can't they use some of the original japanese artwork instead of pasting on some poorly-done fanart?). If Dreamworks doesn't fix this problem soon, I'm willing to bet there will be a lot of people who will never buy another DVD from them again. <br /> <br />I hope they act promptly, so that I can give this movie a rating of 5 stars like it deserves.
B000002J09|5.0|What the Beatles were to Pop, Zeppelin were to Rock. Stairway is an anthem. Black Dog is awesome blues-rock. And Rock & Roll is manic. Any true rock collection must contain Zoso.
B000025AJM|5.0|There are few albums that command the respect and admiration that this one does, nearly 40 years later.  The fact that it's hard to find, and that people (like me) are willing to pay more than would be paid for most other nearly-40-year-old albums, attests to it's enduring value.  It is one of those albums that you can enjoy sober or... <br /> <br />As an ex-musician, I know good musicianship when I hear it.  And I hear it in abundance here.  It is an incredible effort, and well worth paying premium for.
B00004I9VE|5.0|This album is overatted artistically, but it was the best ALBUM of the 80s. Billie Jean, Beat It are the gems here. Michael never got close to this album again. And its success damaged him as we see today. Still it is worth owning a copy of this album.
0141439475|5.0|Much like Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\", Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" is a story we all think we know, but really don't.  Very few films have consciously attempted to follow the novel too closely (which shouldn't detract from the excellent James Whale/Boris Karloff film, or its masterpiece-sequel, \\"The Bride of Frankenstein).  Thus, everything popular culture \\"knows\\" about \\"Frankenstein\\" does not originate from literature, but from films.  This is a shame, in a way, because the novel itself is, if not the progenitor, an early vessel of so many archetypes found science fiction and horror.<br /><br />The basic plot remained intact when transferred to other media.  Swiss medical student Victor Frankenstein discovers the secret of life (which he never reveals, lest someone repeat the mistake).  He then puts together a body, essentially a man, from various corpses.  He then becomes horrified by the creature he has built, and abandons.  The creature, suffering a great deal of neglect and abuse, still manages to get a thorough education, and learns of his lineage.  After murdering Victor's younger brother, and framing the family maid, the creature tells his (admittedly) sad tale to his \\"father\\", and then demands a mate.  Victor, in a panic, agrees, then thinks better of it at the last moment, destroying the new bride.  In retaliation, the creature murders all of Victor's loved ones (including his wife), and leads Victor on a merry chase across the world.<br /><br />Most probably know that Mary Shelley wrote this book in response to a challenge issued by Lord Byron, during a vacation at Lake Geneva.  (Along with this story came John Polidori's \\"The Vampyre\\", the first English vampire novel.)  Most probably also know that Shelley went on to write other works of imaginative gothic fiction.  Still, her modern reputation rests with this book.<br /><br />As stated, numerous archetypes (themes, plot lines, characters) are present here.  The basic fear of what evil technology may bring along with the good is a central theme, as is the warning against playing God.  So is the implicit admonition to be responsible in all things, be it during innovation or being a parent.  The creature is, for all intents and purposes, an android-everyone from Gort to C-3PO owe their existence to the Frankenstein monster.  And the monster that slays all but one protagonist is a staple of horror, be it traditional monster movies, like \\"Alien\\", or more realistic slasher movies like \\"Halloween\\".<br /><br />But, as I noted at the beginning of this review, certain of these elements have been lost in most interpretations.  The creature is actually intelligent, and well-spoken, quite different from the inarticulate grunts or slow, half-sentences of the movies. Further, while the films have made lightening a staple of the creatures creation, Shelley never really explains the process.  Finally, one of the staples of the films is the explanation for the creatures \\"evil\\" nature.  Often, the problem lies with the brain used, which almost invariably is a criminal brain, or is damaged before implantation.  In the book, the creature is really a child that's horribly neglected, but with the strength and intelligence to strike back: id without superego, and without restraints.<br /><br />Thus, \\"Frankenstein\\" will be a new experience for readers who know the source exclusively from the films.  Unlike \\"Dracula\\", there aren't any moments where a reader might look up and suddenly realize how quiet it is in the house, or how dark it's gotten outside.  In that regard, \\"Frankenstein\\" has not aged particularly well.  Throughout, however, it is a moving, disturbing, depressing, but also a touching and beautiful tale.  Those qualities have withstood the test of time.  While it is not always a rollicking adventure, it is a rewarding read.along with the good is a central theme, as is the warning against playing God.

B000002UB3|3.0|This album represented the beginning of the Beatles end. There are 3 excellent songs on this album. SOMETHING, COME TOGETHER AND HERE COMES THE SUN. The rest of the album is very average and substandard by Beatles standards. Nowhere as good as Revolver or SGT Pepper. I think this album is by far the most overatted of all the Beatles work.
1401301010|4.0|Kudos to Anthony Kiedis for sharing his story with us.  <br /> <br />I picked up this book because I live in Anthony Kiedis's hometown.  I was not expecting much beyond a detailed account of Kiedis's drug binges, conquests, and rise to stardom.  There was all that, but more.  Kiedis has come quite a long way over the years.  Now four years sober, he seems to have turned his life around by learning the rewards of reaching out to others, recognizing and owning up to past mistakes, and helping others achieve and maintain sobriety.  This book may very well be inspiration for young fans to steer clear of drugs and excess. <br /> <br />Those who have trivialized this book either have not read the last 1/4 of the book, or they are just missing the point.   <br />
B0002YLC24|5.0|Before Sunset may quite possibly be one of the greatest films of the last 10 years. HOWEVER, I don't believe that everyone will necessarily agree with this opinion. I think that to truly enjoy Before Sunset, one must have experienced a similar moment in their lives such as these two characters. I believe that Before Sunset is the kind of film that gives the viewer a moment in their personal history back to them. In a sense, the film has the ability to stir up a longing for such a moment in ones life, while at the same time satisfying the reunion of these two fictional characters. Before Sunset is the type of film that is enjoyed most when there is no expectation on the part of the viewer, but rather, they should allow themselves to be taken on a journey with these two characters for 80 minutes of their lives. Tempo and flow acts as an asset to the subtleties that make this film truly enjoyable. Most importantly this film once again leaves you wanting more, but at the same time content that you will have to wait for it. Further in fact, on the extras, Hawke mentions the fact that the idea between Hawke, Delpy, and Linklater is to create several more of these films over the next couple of decades, thus allowing those who have fallen in love with these two characters to follow them through the magic of film over the course of 20-30 years. Before Sunset has the ability to captivate and engage the viewer and satisfies 9 years of waiting.
B000005ALP|5.0|Beautiful freak is a haunting cd. The eels have a truly original sound. This is a cd for a person who is tired of all of the same old music and is looking for something more original.
B0002OERI0|1.0|I've never really liked Green Day, but their early stuff was kind of listenable, but this is just trendy, poseur trash. Just because the CD tells a story doesn't make it good. Just because MTV syas its good doesn't mean its good (it usually means it is terrible). Here is how i picture a conversation between two 13 pseudo-skateboarder,poseur kids about this album:    Poseur #1: He did you hear what MTV said about the new Green Day album?  Poseur #2: Yeah, they siad it was like a masterpiece or something. We should go get it and pretend like were cool and talk about the like were really smart and cool.  Poseur #1: Yeah, let's do that, we'll be like the coolest kids in the world.       That's something like what i would expect out of kids these days. They act like this is the first concept (oh, that's what this kind of CD's called) album ever made. Try \\"The Wall\\" by Pink Floyd, that's a concept album if there ever was one. Or Iron Maiden's \\"The Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\". And if you too afraid to listen to music thats older and not played on MTV, then check out Coheed and Cambria. Their albums are all concept albums, with a real intricate, good story. These guys have talent and they have been looked over by much of you trendy MTV kids. The top album of this year is Mastadon's \\"Leviathan\\", which is once again a concept album about Moby Dick. It real goes into all the aspects of the story, the songs go into the views of each person, for example \\"Blood and Thunder\\" goes into what Ahab is thinking. It just doesn't tell a story, it goes much deeper then that. And now that i'm on the topic of Mastadon, the level of muscianship on that CD is astounding, something that just can not be said about Green Day, who have refused to evolve or change their tiresome 3-chord playing over their 10+ years. This CD is not an evolution for anything, its just terrible. It's a pathetic excuse for people to try and look smart.        When it comes down to it, this album is just another attempt by a crappy rock band to complain about the politics and how much they don't like the US and George Bush. They tried to seem all smart by making it a concept album, but in my opinion, it just made look even dumber. And most of these ignorant people have never taken the time to listen to a concept album before. And now there talking about making a movie, which, when that happens, will be the death of the already long dead MTV, mainstream rock.    -------------------------------------------------  Alright, I almost puked this morning reading some of these reviews. Honestly, I don't care about you're musical inclinations, listen to whatever you want, no matter how bad it is, it's none of my buisness. But, the level of incompetence and just plain ignorance is sickening. I mean seriously, come on. This CD is good because it has songs longer than the regular 2-3 minute songs and, on top of that, they don't sing about love, they bash America, the country they're living in. Honestly, if you don't like, Canada is not that far away, we'll be fine without you. Some people just don't realize how good they actually have it. They'd rather just complain, because they're a bunch of spoiled brats. This CD is in no way different then their last couple pieces oof crap, so ignorantly labeled music. There is nothing redeming about this CD, it's just those same old worthless songs strecthed over longer periods of time. They have not advnaced musically at all with this album, but since most people don't actually listen to music, you wouldn't realize that. In summation, I could care less about what you say about this album (if i could even call it that), but labeling it a \\"masterpiece\\", the \\"best CD in a decade\\" and the \\"music for our children\\", is just plain ridiculous and idiotic. One word can sum up htis album and it's sucess: IGNORANCE.    (And it won a grammy because hollywood is filled with a bunch of liberals, who, as it turns out, hate George Bush. And no, in case you were wondering, i don't like George Bush either, but i've come to accept it.)
0670033693|4.0|Woah. SLOW DOWN!!! Everbody RELAX! I've read this book and enjoyed it, but five frickin' stars across the board? That would make it an instant classic. This is not The Great Gatsby. This is a very well-written, entertaining mystery novel.  <br /> <br />I'd say the thing I enjoyed most about it is the writer's style...a nice rhythm to his sentences. Another thing that struck me was the descriptions of landscape. I get the feeling that if Johnson wrote a nonfiction nature book it would be something special. Why I wouldn't give this book five stars, besides that it's not The Great Gatsby, is that some of the humor falls flat to me. Some of it is spot on. But that said, I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a high-quality novel who is not looking for a book that's going to change their life. Johnson is the real thing... looking foward to his next book.
B000654Z2I|5.0|There's not an easy way to describe the music found on _Tago Mago_, but here's a slight stab at it: Imagine a proto-Radiohead (the vocalist reminds one of Thom Yorke at times) with tasteful psychedelic/jam elements *slightly* reminiscent of Cream, The Grateful Dead, The Yardbirds and others of that pantheon - added with an ambient aesthetic foreshadowing some of the ambient/dance music that became large some decades later (this was released in 1971.)<br /><br />This is just a taste of what you'll find on this album, added with many other elements. A track by track overview:<br /><br />\\"Paperhouse\\"--A 7 1/2 minute psychedelic workout featuring some tasteful guitar noodling, an addictive rhythm and some sensual vocals from (then) Oriental singer named Kenji 'Damo' Suzuki. I just love that sensual accent. The first day I got this, I listened to this track alone 23 consecutive times (non-stop), which came out to over 2 1/2 hours. It can get very addictive (as well as the rest of the album.)<br /><br />\\"Mushroom\\"--A proto-ambient/dance number. To be honest, some of these tracks could mislead you from believing this came out in 1971, because they don't sound too dated.<br /><br />\\"Oh Yeah\\"--Another ambient number. This time, with some bluesy licks and some eerie keyboard textures. Once again, the underlying funky, tasteful rhythms can become very addictive.<br /><br />\\"Halleluwah\\"--A mid-tempo number which manages to keep the same rhythm for 1,107 seconds (with the exception of a quiet break somewhere in the middle) without sounding like it drags. By the way, the time limit--1,107 seconds--is 18:27 folks, if you were confused by the \\"seconds\\" sentence. Once again (sorry if I sound repetitive), the grooves & rhythms, the guitar/bass interaction and the vocals are so tasty, they can get addictive.<br /><br />Now, the second half (or second disc, if you own the vinyl) is where it gets VERY challenging and inaccessible - depending on your point of view. These next few tracks are intense, relentless and uncompromising excercises in experimentation.<br /><br />\\"Aumgn\\"--If you pay close attention, you'll notice the opening for \\"Paperhouse\\" is the way this track begins - and elaborates more on what was left behind in favor of the duration of the aforementioned track. Listen to this in the dark, with eyes closed and scare the daylights out of yourself. Listening to this is probably even scarier than most of those cheesy horror flicks. Ominous, slithering keyboard textures, creepy vocal atmospherics and some disturbing, relentless percussion & drumming can be found, which gives this track an aura of exorcism (I'm not joking.)<br /><br />\\"Peking O.\\"--Sounds like a prototype (along with Frank Zappa & The Mothers Of Invention) for the type of thing Mr. Bungle does. This track features moments that will scare you, warp your mind, and make you laugh out loud. Underneath all the demented vocal shoutings (some sped-up) and ultra-bizarre, abrupt switches in dynamics, is an unlikely amalgamation of ambient, reggae, ragtime and fusion.<br /><br />\\"Bring Me Coffee Or Tea\\"--Probably not as inaccessible or wild as the previous two tracks. This time, it's a slow, meditative number featuring some haunting chords, tasteful instrumentation and some exotic percussion that reminds one of the type of instrumentation King Crimson would revel in during their 1973-1974 period. This also probably sounds the most like a prototype for Radiohead.<br /><br />To prevent (further?) embarrassment, I'm going to end this review, because there isn't much more I can say, except that this album is EXCELLENT. I don't consider myself someone who uses big terms very often, but, if there's a new discovery that deserves such big praise - this would definitely come to mind. Recommended to adventurous music listeners, as well as those progressive rock fans that want a little more than Yes, Genesis, ELP, King Crimson stuff (and I'm not degrading these bands, as I love them all as well.)ve them all as well.) <br />
B000002J09|5.0|All the songs are simply great.  Stairway to heaven is reason alone to buy this fantastic work.  One of the best rock albums ever written and performed.  Led Zep showed the world how to rock. A must have for every rock music collection.  No one can sing like Robert Plant did here!  No one can play like Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and the late John Bonham. No one can write like they did. This is a one of a kind rock masterwork that can never be repeated or equalled.  It stands alone above the rest. A 10 star album that will still be among the best in 2105.
0316777722|3.0|A series of entertaining vignettes, much like stories you'd hear on NPR's \\"This American Life.\\"  Some of the stories were quite funny and I laughed out loud at them.  There are a few chapters that build on one another, but most chapters are stories that can be enjoyed separate from the the rest of the book.  Midway through the book, I lost interest.  I still enjoyed the stories, but I wasn't driven to read the book and it was a chore to finish reading it.  Seems like I can only take the stories of David Sedaris in small quantities.  This is definitely a fun read, but I suggest reading only a few chapters at a time.
1577314808|5.0|Following a personal mystical experience, Eckhart Tolle was transformed from a callous atheist to a spiritual believer. This book shares lovely insights and wise suggestions for ways to reach into the dimensions that Tolle discovered spontaneously. He believes that all of us have this awareness within us, but that our chattering mind obscures this. <br /> <br />Here is one of a variety of approaches Tolle suggests for finding the quiet center where we can be present - following his format of questions and answers.  <br /> <br />\\"(You keep talking about the state of presence as the key. I think I understand it intellectually, but I don't know if I have ever truly experienced it. I wonder - is it what I think it is, or is it something entirely different?) <br /> <br />It's not what you think it is! You can't think about presence, and the mind can't understand it. Understanding presence is being present. <br /> <br />Try a little experiment. Close your eyes and say to yourself: \\"I wonder what my next thought is going to be.\\" Then become very alert and wait for the next thought. Be like a cat watching a mouse hole. What thought is going to come out of the mouse hole? Try it now. (p. 77)\\" <br /> <br />Tolle points out that good and evil are two sides of the same thing. Again and again, Tolle makes the point that the only productive spiritual goal is to find the place where we are one with \\"the higher good beyond good and bad.\\"  <br /> <br />Thoughtful, helpful book - for letting go of thought-fullness! <br />

B000063UR2|4.0|Unicorns, dwarves, demons, and... Tom Cruise? Cruise plays a happy-go-lucky forest boy named Jack who's in love with the beautiful virgin princess, Lily (Mia Sara). Everything is idyllic beauty in the mythical sunlit forest where the unicorns play (two beautiful Vavra'esque Andalusians with somewhat floppy horns) until one day Darkness (Tim Curry) comes, wanting to destroy everything. Unusually light, pretty fare for director Ridley Scott; well worth seeing for fans of storybook fantasy. This DVD version (director's cut) is a must-buy for fans of the theatrical release.<br /><br />Staci Layne Wilson
B0006419J6|1.0|The movie bears no relation to the book, they probably just use the title for npublicity. As for this review: <br />WHY ARE YOU COMPARING THIS MOVIE TO THE BOOK!? If you don't want to watch the movie, thats fine, so go into the corner and read your stupid book, but understand THIS IS A MOVIE NOT A BOOK...Did anybody ever say it was SUPPOSED TO BE based on the book? <br />Um, yes... when it had the title, charecters, and theme of the book. Idiot.
B000002JSP|4.0|If you see LED ZEP as having 3 periods of work in their career  this is from the last stage. Early bluesy, hard hitting rock is the first 3 albums.  Led Zep 4 through Presence are the middle period of the bands greatest works having that classic rock, very mature, fully realized and executed Zep only sound. The last period of work is the John Paul Jones influenced synth post-modern period. It is very similar in tone  to Robert Plant's initial solo career workings. Very different from the Page/Plant post-led zep sound of today. In the evening and all of my love represent this newest, great sound from the band.  An essential melodic work to have for the true LZ fan.
B000001ES9|2.0|At the time they released their self-titled album in 1974, Rush showed little indication of the strong catalog of music they would produce over the next 30 years. Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and John Rutsey play hard rock here that clearly show their three big influences, Led Zeppelin, Cream, and Black Sabbath. The arrival of Neil Peart's ambitious and creative drumming as well as his intelligent lyrics wouldn't arrive until their next album Fly By Night. So while the music here is competent and features some occassional nimble bass playing from Lee, it  doesn't stand out from several other hard rock bands at the time.<br /><br />The best tracks here by far are the energetic hard rocker \\"Finding My Way\\" and the closing \\"Working Man\\" which recalls Cream with Lifeson playing the role of Eric Clapton but sounding more like Black Sabbath's Tony Iommi in both tone and style. In fact, \\"Working Man\\" remains a staple of their live show and still gets occassional airplay on classic rock radio. Other solid tracks here include the working class rock of \\"In The Mood\\" and \\"What You're Doing\\" which features a cool heavy riff. The remaining tracks are not up to par. The tracks \\"Need Some Love\\" and \\"Take A Friend\\" suffer from weak riffs and cliched lyrics which wouldn't rear their ugly head once Peart came on board, except maybe for \\"I Think I'm Going Bald\\" from Caress Of Steel. \\"Here Again\\" and \\"Before And After\\" are both unmemorable and just drag on and on. Also worth noting is that Lee tries to emulate Robert Plant with his high pitched yelps throughout the album but simply doesn't have the vocal range to pull it off. Rutsey's drumming is solid throughout but possesses little of the skill of Peart. Outside of perhaps Caress Of Steel, which has two great tracks, two boring epics, and the aforementioned \\"I Think I'm Going Bald\\", this is probably their worst album. The diehard fans already own this. More casual fans may want to purchase Chronicles which feature both \\"Working Man\\" and \\"Finding My Way.\\"nd \\"Finding My Way.\\"
B000001EC1|4.0|Not all of Bon Jovi's greatest hits are here but enough of them are to make this a fantastic album - songs such as the legendary 'Living on a Prayer', 'Bed of Roses', 'Blaze of Glory' and 'In These Arms' are guaranteed to make you stomp, wail, weep and pound your fists into the air. As much hyperbolic passion in tight trousers as you are ever likely to find.
B0002TSZK6|5.0|Congratulations to this film for winning the People's Choice Award for Best Movie of 2004. Michael Moore accepted the award in honor of our service men and women overseas.<br /><br />The movie is a documentary. It takes an anti-administration position. The movie is entertaining and pushes for changes in the Government's position in Iraq and in other issues. The movie gives this viewer the feeling that it is about 50% spin and about 50% truth. However, the film is still chilling since a USA Administration in power has such awesome power that the truth is hard to differentiate from the Administration's own spin. Blues, you are wise to be concerned. Reds, do not be blinded by the Administration's own spin.
B00005JN2Z|3.0|To be frank, I'm not certain if I cared for this movie as much as I had originally thought after walking out of the theatre. The more thought I give to \\" Collateral \\" the less seems to make sense and the less I seem to be able to give it my complete approval. <br /> <br />Since everyone seems well aware of the story-line I'll dispense with that but for this film to work you truly do need to put a certain amount of reality on hold. I'm sorry but for starters how am I to believe that Vincent ( Tom Cruise sporting a truly terrible blonde mane. He should of been looking to assasinate whoever gave him that cut and dye! ) playing a notorious, but well-dressed, hit-man is going to parade around Los Angelos in a cab, popping off victims while the cabbie, I suppose, is to sit in his taxi counting up the money offered by our somewhat misguided killer? Vincent may be the worlds most trusting killer in the history of film noir. Right away the premise is beyond believable! But if one is able to neglect that glaring nonsense the movie does have its good points. But there are other problems that arise... <br /> <br />The action is pretty much non-stop and the interaction between Cruise and Jamie Foxx is plausible if not exactly revelatory. Tom's character, when not killing his victims, offers Jamie career advice during the interim. A strange mix of Dr. Phil's 'tough love' meeting 'Killers Row.' Sadly though while this is done with the single intention of getting the audience to actually care for Vincent it simply never really comes together. While Mr. Cruise, in his own way, is a fine actor I never truly believed for a moment in his ability to come across as a hardened murderer. Perhaps he was supposeed the play the 'killer with a heart of gold' but I didn't sense that either.  The whole thing does come across as Tom Crise in an expensive suit, sporting a week old beard and trying to look cool/urban though married with a certain odd neuroticism. Tom is a fine actor but in this role he seems somewhat miscast. Though Jamie Foxx as the cabbie with motivational issues does an exceedingly wonderful job and he virtually saves the film himself. Though to be honest, while previous reviewers have found their dialogue interesting I found the majority to be contrived and devoid and any true substance. I mean, we have Vincent offering Foxx's character advice on affairs of the heart!!?? Plus, in one silly scene he forces the cabbie to take him to his mothers hospital room so the cabbies nightly routine does not appear askew. I'm assuming this was included to give Vincent's character a rather 'warm and fuzzy' appeal that offers the film its one tender moment. Truly bizaare and almost desperate in its attempt to come across as dark and intriguing. One could almost sense director Michael Mann trying to throw in anything that might give this movie another added depth but it merely came across as contrived. The only saving grace was Mr. Manns inate ability to use Los Angelos as a third character, giving the film a nice, urban detached look that worked extremely well. Obviously M. Mann could be accused of throwing in everything,including the kitchen sink, to make this work and sadly it comes across as slightly pieced together.  <br /> <br />Overall, while a nice enough movie I found far too many scenes somewhat unreal and lacking any real substance. It does flow well and it will keep you in your seat ( though hardly on the edge! ) but the further the movie went into its inevitable conclusion the more its seemed to slip into an almost weird urban fairy tale. It all became oddly episodic but never completely mesmorizing. Nevertheless, an enjoyable movie for guys who love lots of \\" bang, bang \\" but little interesting dialogue to get in the way. Three and one half stars.  <br />
B000002J0B|5.0|More from the BEST rock band that ever lived. If you can only buy 3 records buy this one along with Led Zep 4 and Physical Graffitti, you won't be sorry. These are the best the band has to offer.  Houses of the Holy just rocks.  A more sensitive and slower version of rock and roll blues from the boys we all know.  Every song is a classic. It doesn't get any better than this folks, really! A ten star album to cherish for years...
B00000JPYQ|5.0|Having been very sheltered in my teen years, when I turned 18 in 1979 I decided to go to a rock concert.  Ted Nugent was sold out so I asked the lady at the ticket counter what other concerts were available.  The concert warmed up with \\"On Broadway\\", the second act was Judas Priest, touring their \\"Hell Bent for Leather\\" album, and UFO touring the \\"Strangers in the Night\\" album.  I was blown away.   <br /> <br />I bought the vinyl LP the next day.  I bought it again a few years later to replace it when my wife destroyed it during a fight.  (She knew where to hit me where it hurt and now she's my ex-wife)  I also bought the cassette tape somewhere along the line and it is one of the first CD's I ever bought.  There was a problem with the original release of the CD though.  The tracks were cut in the wrong place.  If the songs were played individually, you would hear the intro to \\"Let it Roll\\" at the end of another song.  This annoyed me on those few ocasions when I didn't play it straight through. <br /> <br />Finally, I bought the Remastered Expanded edition which not only fixed that problem, but added a couple of songs from their later releases, \\"Hot 'N' Ready\\" and \\"Cherry.\\"  Some of the live chatter from Mogg will be new to those familiar with earlier versions, but it's all good.  The CD insert on this one is much better too.  It folds out and has the artwork from the original gatefold of the album as well as the front and back along with a short history of the band added. <br /> <br />There are only two other live albums I would rank higher than this one and they are \\"Just One Night\\" by Eric Clapton and \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" by Led Zeppelin.  Maybe if I had gotten to the box office a bit earlier I might be saying the same thing about \\"Double Live Gonzo\\"... Sorry Ted.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Hillarious...We all knew a \\"Napoleon\\" during our high school years. Each character in this movie represents a character from my high school years. Napoleon, a \\"weird\\" kid that thinks his weak drawing skills are superb, is a blatant liar, and takes his belief in mythical characters seriously. Pedro, the overachieving underdog, regardless of the ethnic background, his not-so popular character always had enough \\"pelotas\\" to do things that he wasn't supposed to do (like asking the most popular girl to the school dance, and later running against her for school president). I can go on for hours describing each character and their resemblance to my own personal high school classmates. But if I will let this movie transport you to your high school years. See Uncle Rico? the time machine actually does work!!!!
0393035158|5.0|This is an excellent book for someone who has begun to realize the intellectual fraud that religion has wrought upon us over the last several millennia.  It completes a triad of books I have read lately. The other two are: <br />The Jesus Puzzle by Earl Doherty and The Pagan Christ by Tom Harpur. <br /> <br />These three books will free your mind and let you begin exploring the real world outside the \\"cave of shadows\\" (Plato) in which we have been trapped by religious nonsense. <br />
B0006399FS|3.0|As of this review it is New Year's Day 2005 - Happy New Year's!    Having been an early U2 fan, I haven't cared much for the 1990s+ bunging jumping in the abyss version of the band. Though I will credit them with improved sound - Bob Ludwig meets Mutt Lange-styled clarity.    Having heard this recording, there are three songs that stand out and are true to form with this group - \\"Vertigo\\", \\"All Because of You\\", and \\"Yahweh\\". They are the full circle to \\"October\\". I think they could have worked more on the other songs. Yet, while the sound is very good, it is not the same.
B000002JSJ|4.0|A nice addition for the experienced LED ZEP fan looking for more. Some nice riffs to add to your collection.
0780628551|1.0|Don't waste your money seeing this movie. The plot and the story are just awful, and Theron and Depp can't salvage it with their personalities or acting abilities. See their other movies which showcase their true talents.
B000000OSG|3.0|Use Your Illusion I and II... if they had taken out the filler and kept the good stuff... man... it would be equal or better than Appetite. I dont understand why anyone would like UYI2 more than 1 though... the first one has  November Rain, Dont Cry, Coma, Live And Let Die (which i personally dont like.. but alot of people do.. so hey), and other classics.. while the second has just Civil War and Estranged. Plus UYI1 has all the rockin music like Garden Of Eden and Right Next Door To Hell.     ALSO UYI2 HAS THE WORST GNR SONG EVER ON IT! MY WORLD IS CRAP. how could ANYONE like that song? It trys to be industral rock (think 9 inch nails) but ends up sounding like rap metal.. which we all know is BAD. Makes me sad that thats the direction Axl is taking GNR 2.0 on... the other lame song is Get In The Ring. crap!    Overall... i would just download Civil War and Estranged instead of buying this. Buy #1 if you want a better CD. [...]
B00005JN2Z|5.0|This movie has it all. Great acting, superb camera work, terrific directing, great storyline .... Hey, the list goes on and on. This is one of the few thrillers to enjoy again and again. There's always something new to discover, even when you know the story by heart. Buy it!
B000002JSN|5.0|Classic among classics, Physical Grafitti is arguably Zeppelins finest work, THE MASTERPIECE. The band was soaring higher than anyone could dare reach again, even themselves. Tunes like Custard Pie, the Rover and In my time of Dying bring a new dimension to mere heavy metal. Listen to this album and you will see the real band that influenced hundreds of imitators. Soulful rifs like Houses of the holy and In the Light show one what true genius is. Kashmir stands alone as as the perfect rock dirge and as a stunning contrast to the forth albums Stairway to Heaven. This is the Mount Everest of rock albums, its all downhill from here. There is none better. <br /> <br />PS: Don't listen to reviewers who give this this record anything less than 5 stars. Anyone who does is NOT a true LedZep fan, simple as that. It has been almost 30 years since this disc came out. It shines brighter now than ever.  In a hundred years when we are all dead and buried this artistic work will still be held up as the best rock effort ever produced. Period.  End of story... <br />
B00003CX9Q|5.0|Oh,it was released in 1982,8 years before I born,I can call it \\"a old movie\\", I had never seen it before, and my parents were never mentioned it, maybe they forgot. And just the other day, I felt bored and watched my favorite movie channel \\"Sci-Fi\\", just find this movie, and I was cried at two points, one is E.T.'s \\"dead\\", another one is E.T. back to home. It's a very moving movie,and it's a great movie!
0671027387|3.0|I will start this out by saying that I am a liberal, but I was still taken aback by how strongly negative this book was toward conservatives. Even Darth Vader is a more likeable and compassionate character than Brown's Senator Sedgewick. By making Sedgewick so evil, Brown managed by comparison to make murderous [...] into good guys.<br /><br />I also found it disappointing to see Brown rely on typical gender stereotypes. The heroine of the story is frail and needs her male sidekick to save the day. Sedgewick's assistant is likewise easily manipulated and frankly too weak to be believable in her role.<br /><br />All that aside... I still thought the book was a fun read. Dan Brown does a phenomenal job at grabbing the reader's interest and holding onto it tightly. His books are thought-provoking, exciting and more intellectual than most other fictions on the market.
